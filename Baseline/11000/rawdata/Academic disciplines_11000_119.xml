[[File:Examples of common-time and 4-4 notation.jpg|thumb|Examples of time signatures for common time.]]
'''''Alla breve''''' {{IPA-it|alla ˈbrɛːve|}} is a [[Meter (music)|musical meter]] notated by the [[time signature]] symbol {{music|cut-time}} (a C with a vertical line through it), which is the equivalent of {{music|time|2|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Randel (2003), pp.33, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "on the breve",  originally meaning that the beat was counted on the [[double whole note|breve]].&lt;ref&gt;LilyPond — Music Glossary v2.18.2 (http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.18/Documentation/music-glossary/alla-breve)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alla breve'' is a "[[Meter (music)#Simple meter|simple]]-[[duple meter]] with a half-note [[pulse (music)|pulse]]".&lt;ref name="Duckworth"&gt;Duckworth, William (2009). ''A Creative Approach to Music Fundamentals'', p.38. {{ISBN|0-495-57220-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The note denomination which represents one beat in is the [[minim (music)|minim]] or half-note.  There are two of these per bar, so that the time signature {{music|time|2|2}} may be interpreted as "two minim beats per bar."

''Alla breve'' is also known as '''cut time''' or '''cut common time'''.  (Common time, notated with the time signature symbol {{music|common-time}}, is the equivalent of {{music|time|4|4}}.&lt;ref name=Randel33/&gt;  It uses a [[quarter note]] (or crotchet) beat and there are four per bar.)

==Modern usage==
In contemporary usage ''alla breve'' suggests a fairly quick [[tempo]]. Thus, it is used frequently for military [[march (music)|marches]]. From about 1600 to 1900 its usage with regard to tempo varied, so it cannot always be taken to mean a quick tempo.&lt;ref name=Randel33&gt;Randel (2003), p.33&lt;/ref&gt;  The reason for the usage of "alla breve" is to allow the musician to read notes of short duration more cleanly with fewer beats.

==Historical usage==
Prior to 1600 the term ''alla breve'' derives from the system of [[mensural notation|mensural or proportional notation]] (also called ''proportio dupla'') in which note values (and their graphical shapes) were related by the ratio 2:1. In this context it means that the ''tactus'' or metrical pulse (now commonly referred to as the "[[Beat (music)|beat]]") is switched from its normal place on the [[whole note]] (''semibreve'') to the [[double whole note]] (''breve'').&lt;ref name=Randel33/&gt;

Early music notation was developed by religious orders, which has resulted in some religious associations in notation. The most obvious is that music in triple time was called ''tempus perfectum'', deriving its name from the [[Holy Trinity]] and represented by the "perfect" circle, which has no beginning or end.

Music in duple time was similarly called ''tempus imperfectum''. Its symbol was the broken circle, " {{music|common-time}}", which is still used — although it has evolved to mean {{music|time|4|4}}, or "common time", today. When cut through by a vertical line "{{music|cut-time}}" , it means {{music|time|2|2}} — "cut common", or alla breve.&lt;ref&gt;Novello, John (1986). ''The Contemporary Keyboardist'', p.37. {{ISBN|0-634-01091-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the vertical line or stroke in a musical graphical symbol, as practiced in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and now referred to by the modern term of "cut time", did not always have the same meaning as ''alla breve''. It sometimes had other functions, including non-mensural ones.&lt;ref&gt;"Cut time" in Sadie (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5570">In 1933, [[Edwin H. Armstrong]] patented a method for generating [[frequency modulation]] of [[radio signal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 1,941,068&lt;/ref&gt;    The '''Armstrong method''' generates a double [[sideband]] suppressed [[carrier signal]], [[phase shift]]s this signal, and then reinserts the carrier to produce a frequency modulated signal.

[[Frequency modulation]] generates high quality [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] and greatly reduces the amount of [[noise]] on the channel when compared with [[amplitude modulation]].  Early broadcasters used amplitude modulation because it was easier to generate than frequency modulation and because the receivers were simpler to make.  The [[electronics theory]] indicated that a frequency modulated signal would have infinite [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]; for an amplitude modulated signal, the bandwidth is approximately twice the highest modulating frequency.

Armstrong realized that while a frequency modulated signal would have an infinite bandwidth, only the first few sets of sidebands would be significant; the rest could be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;''The ARRL Handbook for Radio Communication'', American Radio Relay League, 2008, p. 9.30&lt;/ref&gt;  An amplitude modulated [[voice channel]] bandwidth would be approximately 6 [[kilohertz]]; a common frequency modulated voice channel bandwidth could be 15 kilohertz.

== How it works ==

The Armstrong method begins by generating a [[carrier signal]] at a very low [[frequency]], say 500 kilohertz.  This frequency is below the [[AM broadcast]] band and much below the current [[FM broadcast]] band of 88 to 108 [[megahertz]].  This carrier signal is applied to two stages in the [[transmitter]]:  a [[balanced modulator]] and a [[Frequency mixer|mixer]].

To understand how a [[balanced modulator]] works it is necessary to understand [[amplitude modulation]] and how it works.  Most people describe [[amplitude modulation]] as a method of changing the strength of the carrier (amplitude) in sync with the modulating audio.  This is true, the [[power output]] does change with [[modulation]], but it changes because any AM  modulator generates two sidebands, one above and one below the carrier.   As power goes into these sidebands, the power output increases.  The amplitude modulated signal, then, consists of a constant strength carrier and two sidebands.  The sidebands carry the information and the carrier just goes along for the ride.  The carrier can be removed at the transmitter and reinserted at the receiver to allow the transmitter to put all the power in the sidebands.

A [[frequency modulator]] also generates sidebands, but instead of one sideband on each side of the carrier, it generates many sidebands on each side of the carrier.  The [[FM bandwidth]] is wider because of the many sidebands.  The power output from an [[Transmitter|FM transmitter]] is constant with modulation, so as power goes into the sidebands, the carrier power is reduced.

A [[balanced modulator]] mixes the [[audio signal]] and the radio frequency carrier, but suppresses the carrier, leaving only the sidebands.  The output from the balanced modulator is a double sideband suppressed carrier signal and it contains all the information that the AM signal has, but without the carrier.  It is possible to generate an AM signal by taking the output from the balanced modulator and reinserting the carrier.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Campbell, and Larkin.  ''Experimental Methods in RF Design'', American Radio Relay League, 2003, p. 9.49&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Armstrong method, the audio signal and the radio frequency carrier signal are applied to the balanced modulator  to generate a double sideband suppressed carrier signal. The phase of this output signal is then shifted 90 degrees with respect to the original carrier.  The balanced modulator output can either lead or lag the carrier's phase.  The double sideband signal and the original carrier signal are  then applied to the mixer, and the original carrier—90 degrees out of phase—is reinserted.  The output from the mixer  is a frequency modulated signal.

Reinserting the carrier without the phase shift produces an AM signal.  Reinserting the carrier with the 90 degree phase shift produces a [[phase modulation|PM]] signal. If the intelligence is integrated before being applied to the resulting phase modulator, this equivalent to a [[frequency modulation|FM]] signal.

One of the problems with the Armstrong method is that the [[frequency deviation]]—the amount of modulation—must be kept small to minimize [[distortion]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 1,941,068&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum deviation is a fraction of 1 kilohertz, but FM broadcast requires 75 kilohertz deviation and a typical FM voice channel deviation is 5 kilohertz.  To solve this problem, Armstrong multiplied the signal many times to a higher frequency to obtain the necessary deviation.  For example, to generate an FM signal with 5 kilohertz deviation at 146.94 megahertz, the transmitter would generate a signal at 6.1225 megahertz with only 0.2 kilohertz deviation, and then multiply the signal 24 times.

== Legacy ==

The Armstrong method is no longer used commercially.  Frequency modulation is most commonly generated at the [[operating frequency]] with the required deviation.  While the system was being used in the 1930s and 1940s it provided a high quality FM audio signal

A '''bean-feast''' was an informal term for a celebratory meal or party, especially an annual summer dinner given by an employer to his or her employees, probably derived from a tradition in the [[Low Countries]] at [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Bean-Feast |volume=3 |page=573}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, colloquially, it describes any festive occasion with a meal and perhaps an outing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/beanfeast From Merriam Webster Unabridged Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; The word, and its shorter form "beano," are fairly common in Britain, less known in the United States. An alternative derivation refers the name to the eating of a dish of beans and bacon, and seems to trace to 1725, when Daniel Day of [[Wapping]], London began to entertain friends near his estate at [[Fairlop]] in [[Essex]] on the first Friday in July.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qlJEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 ''Beauties of England and Wales''], Volume 10, Issue 3, Part 1, By Britton, pub. T. Maiden, 1815&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the beanfeast often took the form of a trip to some beauty spot, where the meal was provided. (e.g. ..''I want a feast, I want a bean feast. Cream buns and doughnuts and fruitcake with no nuts, so good you could go nuts. '' - Veruca Salt, [[Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory]])

It is derived from the [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]] feast, at which a [[king cake]] or pie with a special object or "favour" buried in it was a great feature. This remains a common custom in much of Europe and former European colonies; in the US mainly in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tI0eemYCDFgC&amp;pg=PA48 ''Mardi Gras, Gumbo, and Zydeco: Readings in Louisiana Culture''], eds Marcia G. Gaudet, James C. McDonald, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;  Elsewhere the favour took various forms, including metal tokens and small pottery figures.  In the Low Countries a bean was usual.  The '''bean king''' for the rest of the night was the person who had the slice of cake containing the bean.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  The king (or queen) was given a paper crown to wear, and appointed various court officials.  When the king took a drink, all the party shouted "the king drinks". The subject was often painted by [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painters]], especially [[Jacob Jordaens]] and [[Jan Steen]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hermitagemuseum.org/wps/portal/hermitage/digital-collection/01.+Paintings/48341/?lng= Hermitage Museum]; [https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-feast-of-the-bean-king/MwEBgGg74T1f2g]; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hTBv607RId8C&amp;pg=PT45 ''Beans: A History''], Ken Albala, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12558">'''Biocultural anthropology''' can be defined in numerous ways. It is the [[scientific]] exploration of the relationships between [[human biology]] and [[culture]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~kelso/Biologicalanth.html|title=Principles of Biocultural Anthropology|website=spot.colorado.edu|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Instead of looking for the biology underlying biological roots of human behavior, biocultural anthropology attempts to understand how culture affects our biological capacities and limitations."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
[[Biological anthropology|Physical anthropologists]] throughout the first half of the 20th century viewed this relationship from a [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] perspective; that is, from the assumption that [[Typology (anthropology)|typological]] human biological differences lead to cultural differences.&lt;ref name="Biocult_syn"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Goodman |editor-first=Alan H. |editor2=Thomas L.

The shift towards understanding the role of culture to human biology led to the development of [[Dual inheritance theory]] in the 1960s. In relation to, and following the development of Dual-inheritance theory, [[biocultural evolution]] was introduced and first used in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bioculturalevolution.net/biocultural-overview/|title=Biocultural Evolution–An Overview|date=2013-05-22|newspaper=The Biocultural Evolution Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* "What's Cultural about Biocultural Research," Written by William W.

== Contemporary biocultural anthropology ==
Biocultural methods focus on the interactions between humans and their environment to understand human biological [[adaptation]] and [[Human genetic variation|variation]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0095.xml|title=Biocultural Anthropology - Anthropology - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary biocultural anthropologists view culture as having several key roles in human biological variation:
* Culture is a major human adaptation, permitting individuals and populations to adapt to widely varying local [[ecologies]].
* Characteristic human biological or biobehavioral features, such as a large [[frontal cortex]] and intensive [[parenting]] compared to other primates, are viewed in part as an [[adaptation]] to the complex social relations created by culture.&lt;ref name=Geary_Flinn&gt;{{cite journal

* Culture shapes the [[political economy]], thereby influencing what resources are available to individuals to feed and shelter themselves, protect themselves from disease, and otherwise maintain their health.&lt;ref name=Biocult_syn /&gt;
* Culture shapes the way people think about the world, altering their biology by influencing their behavior (e.g., food choice) or more directly through [[psychosomatic]] effects (e.g., the biological effects of [[Stress (medicine)|psychological stress]]).&lt;ref name=Hruschka_et_al&gt;{{cite journal

While biocultural anthropologists are found in many academic anthropology departments, usually as a minority of the faculty, certain departments have placed considerable emphasis on the "biocultural synthesis".  Historically, this has included [[Emory University]], the [[University of Alabama]], [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|UMass Amherst]] (especially in biocultural [[bioarchaeology]]) [http://www.umass.edu/bioarchaeology] [https://web.archive.org/web/20141030031504/http://www.umass.edu/anthro/faculty/permanent.html], and the [[University of Washington]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20090415073607/http://depts.washington.edu/anthweb/programs/biocultural.php], each of which built [[Ph.D.]] programs around biocultural anthropology; [[Binghamton University]], which has a [[Master of Science|M.S.]] program in biomedical anthropology; [[Oregon State University]], University of Kentucky and others. [[Paul T. Baker|Paul Baker]], an anthropologist at [[Penn State]] whose work focused upon human adaptation to environmental variations, is credited with having popularized the concept of "biocultural" anthropology as a distinct subcategory of [[anthropology]] in general.&lt;ref name=Bindon&gt;{{cite journal

== Controversy == 
{{unclear|section|date=February 2018}}
Other anthropologists, both [[biological anthropology|biological]] and [[cultural anthropology|cultural]], have criticized the biocultural synthesis, generally as part of a broader critique of "[[four-field holism]]" in U.S. anthropology (see [[anthropology]] main article).  Typically such criticisms rest on the belief that biocultural anthropology imposes holism upon the biological and cultural subfields without adding value, or even destructively.  For instance, contributors in the edited volume ''Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology''&lt;ref name=Sacred_bundle&gt;{{cite book |last=[http://pzacad.pitzer.edu/%7Edsegal/ Segal] |first=Daniel A. |editors=Sylvia J.

Some departments of anthropology have fully split, usually dividing [[scientific]] from humanistic anthropologists, such as [[Stanford|Stanford's]] highly publicized 1998 division into departments of "Cultural and Social Anthropology" and "Anthropological Sciences".  Underscoring the continuing controversy, this split is now being reversed over the objections of some faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2007/february14/anthsci-021407.html Anthropology departments instructed to form combined unit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Other departments, such as at [[Harvard]], have distinct biological and sociocultural anthropology "wings" not designed to foster cross subdisciplinary interchange.

Biocultural approaches were derived from [[biology]] and science yet social theorists {{who|date=February 2018}} are feeling encroached upon.{{weasel-inline|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; {{deadlink|date=February 2018}} The Biocultural approach has also not been a central concern to anthropologists {{dubious|date=February 2018}} which is a contributor to the splitting of the approach into [[sociocultural anthropology]] and biosocial anthropology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biocult_syn" /&gt; Biocultural research has shown to contain a few challenges to the researcher.  "In general we are much more experienced in measuring the biological than the cultural. It is also difficult to precisely define what is meant by constructs such as socioeconomic status, poverty, rural, and urban. Operationalizing key variables so that they can be measured in ways that are enthnographically valid as well as replicable. Defining and measuring multiple causal pathways."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7177">'''Biological integrity''' is associated with how "pristine" an [[natural environment|environment]] is and its function relative to the potential or original state of an [[ecosystem]] before human alterations were imposed. Biological integrity is built on the assumption that a decline in the values of an ecosystem's [[Aquatic ecosystem#Functions|functions]] are primarily caused by human activity or alterations. The more an environment and its original processes are altered, the less biological integrity it holds for the [[community (ecology)|community]] as a whole. If these processes were to change over time naturally, without human influence, the integrity of the ecosystem would remain intact. The integrity of the ecosystem relies heavily on the processes that occur within it because those determine what [[organism]]s can inhabit an area and the complexities of their interactions.

==History==
The concept of biological integrity first appeared in the 1972 amendments to the U.S. Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the [[Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;"The objective of this chapter is to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters." Clean Water Act, section 101(a), {{USC|33|1251(a)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had used the term as a way to gauge the standards to which [[water]] should be maintained, but the vocabulary instigated years of debate about the implications of not only the meaning of biological integrity, but also how it can be [[Water quality#Measurement|measured]]. The first conference about the term occurred in March 1975 called "The Integrity of Water"&lt;ref&gt;Ballentine, R.K. and L.J. Guarraia (editors)(1977). [http://yosemite.epa.gov/water/owrccatalog.nsf/e673c95b11602f2385256ae1007279fe/0fdf60b25f9fc7b585256b0600723dc0!OpenDocument ''The Integrity of Water.''] Proceedings of a Symposium, March 10–12, 1975, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, D.C. EPA Publication No. 832-R-75-103.&lt;/ref&gt;  and provided the first accepted definition of biological integrity (see below). In 1981, EPA assembled a field of experts from the U.S. [[Fish and Wildlife Service]], academia, and its own staff to further refine the definition and identify key [[bioindicator|indicators]] to quantitatively measure biological integrity. The conference not only identified a definition, but also methods to evaluate the community, and they established that multiple sites should be used to determine the condition of the environment&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, R.M., J.H. Gakstatter, M.A. Shirazi.and J.M. Omernik (1982). [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AnApproachforDeterminingBiologicalIntegrityinFlowingWaters_hughes_etal_1982.pdf "An approach for determining biological integrity in flowing waters."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612221954/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AnApproachforDeterminingBiologicalIntegrityinFlowingWaters_hughes_etal_1982.pdf |date=June 12, 2010 }} Pages 877-888 in T.B. Brown (editor), ''In Place Resource Inventories: Principles and Practices, A National Workshop.'' Paper presented at the workshop August 9–14, 1981. [http://www.safnet.org Society of American Foresters], Bethesda, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Today, the accepted definition is "the capability of supporting and maintaining a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a [[species]] composition, [[species diversity|diversity]], and functional organization comparable to that of the natural [[habitat]] of the region."&lt;ref&gt;Karr, J.R. and D.R. Dudley (1981). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x96t510nu2418348/fulltext.pdf "Ecological perspectives on water quality goals."] [https://www.springer.com/environment/environmental+management/journal/267 ''Environmental Management''] 5:55-68.&lt;/ref&gt;  This definition was adapted from Frey (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Frey, D. 1977. [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/frey_1977.pdf "Biological integrity of water: an historical approach."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217084900/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/frey_1977.pdf |date=December 17, 2008 }} Pages 127-140 in Ballentine and Guarraia, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt; The implications of this definition are that [[living systems]] have a variety of scales relative to which they exist, that one can quantify the parts that sustain or contribute to a system's functioning and that all systems must be seen in the context of their environments and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary]] history. This term primarily refers to [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environments]] because the vocabulary is derived from the Clean Water Act, but the concepts can be applied to other ecosystems.

==Evaluation methods==
In order to quantify and evaluate the biological integrity of a system, the '''[[Index of biological integrity|Index of Biological Integrity]] (IBI)''' was created.&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. (1981). [http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AssessmentofBioticIntegrityUsingFishCommunities.pdf "Assessment of biotic integrity using fish communities."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613002834/http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/pdf/AssessmentofBioticIntegrityUsingFishCommunities.pdf |date=June 13, 2010 }} [http://afs.allenpress.com/perlserv/?request=get-moreinfo&amp;issn=1548-8446 ''Fisheries'']{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} 6:21–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karr, James R. 1991. [https://archive.is/20120730211209/http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1941848 "Biological integrity: A long-neglected aspect of water resource management."] [http://esapubs.org/esapubs/journals/applications.htm Ecological Applications] 1:66–84.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this index the baseline biological integrity (its function before human influence) and the current functions of an ecosystem are measured against one another to evaluate how much of ecosystem's function has been preserved. The IBI evaluates the ecosystem by utilizing [[biosurvey]]s and comparing [[species richness]], indicator [[taxon|taxa]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]], and [[invasive species]]. IBIs are used primarily to evaluate [[aquatic ecosystem]]s even though one could technically apply any measurement of biological integrity to any natural ecosystem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5079">A ''' Block and bleed manifold''' is a [[hydraulic manifold]] that combines one or more block/isolate [[hydraulic valve|valves]], usually [[ball valve]]s, and one or more bleed/vent valves, usually ball or [[needle valve]]s, into one component for interface with other components (pressure measurement transmitters, [[Gauge (engineering)|gauge]]s, [[switch]]es, etc.) of a [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] ([[fluid]]) system.  The purpose of the block and bleed manifold is to isolate or block the flow of fluid in the system so the fluid from upstream of the manifold does not reach other components of the system that are downstream. Then they bleed off or vent the remaining fluid from the system on the downstream side of the manifold.  For example, a block and bleed manifold would be used to stop the flow of fluids to some component, then vent the fluid from that component’s side of the manifold, in order to effect some kind of work (maintenance/repair/replacement) on that component.

== Types of valves ==

=== Block and Bleed ===
A block and bleed manifold with one block valve and one bleed valve is also known as an '''[[isolation valve]]''' or '''block and bleed valve'''; a block and bleed manifold with multiple valves is also known as an '''isolation manifold'''. This valve is used in combustible gas trains in many industrial applications. Block and bleed needle valves are used in hydraulic and pneumatic systems because the needle valve allows for precise flow regulation when there is low flow in a non-hazardous environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Needle Valves {{!}} Needle Valve Master Distributor - Hy-Lok USA|url = http://www.hylokusa.com/products/valves/needle-valves/|website = Hy-lok USA|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Double Block and Bleed (DBB Valves) ===
These valves replace existing traditional techniques employed by pipeline engineers to generate a double block and bleed configuration in the pipeline. Two block valves and a bleed valve are as a unit, or manifold, to be installed for positive isolation. Used for critical process service, DBB valves are for high pressure systems or toxic/hazardous fluid processes. Applications that use DBB valves include instrument drain, chemical injection connection, chemical seal isolation, and gauge isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Double Block &amp; Bleed Valves - Hy-Lok USA|url = http://www.hylokusa.com/double-block-bleed-valves/|website = Hy-lok USA|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; DBB valves do the work of three separate valves (2 isolations and 1 drain) and require less space and have less weight.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introduction to Valves - Only the Basics - - Introduction to block &amp; bleed Valves and block &amp; bleed systems -|url = http://www.wermac.org/valves/valves_dbb.html|website = www.wermac.org|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cartridge Type Standard Length DBB ===
This type of Double Block and Bleed Valves have a patented design which incorporates two ball valves and a bleed valve into one compact cartridge type unit with ANSI B16.5 tapped flanged connections. The major benefit of this design configuration is that the valve has the same face-to-face dimension as a single block ball valve (as specified in API 6D and ANSI B16.10), which means the valve can easily be installed into an existing pipeline without the need for any pipeline re-working.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

=== Three Piece Non Standard Length DBB ===
This type of Double Block and Bleed Valves (DBB Valves) feature the traditional style of flange-by-flange type valve and is available with ANSI B16.5 flanges, hub connections and welded ends to suit the pipeline system it is to be installed in. It features all the benefits of the single unit DBB valve, with the added benefit of a bespoke face-to-face dimension if required.

=== Single Unit DBB ===
This design also has operational advantages, there are significantly fewer potential leak paths within the double block and bleed section of the pipeline. Because the valves are full bore with an uninterrupted flow orifice they have got a negligible pressure drop across the unit. The pipelines where these valves are installed can also be pigged without any problems.

There are several advantages in using a Double Block and Bleed Valve. Significantly, because all the valve components are housed in a single unit, the space required for the installation is dramatically reduced thus freeing up room for other pieces of essential equipment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Considering the operations and procedures executed before an operator can intervene, the Double Block and Bleed manifold offers further advantages over the traditional hook up. Due to the volume of the cavity between the two balls being so small, the operator is afforded the opportunity to evacuate this space efficiently thereby quickly establishing a safe working environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33340">'''Cognitive development''' is a field of study in [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]] focusing on a child's development in terms of information processing, conceptual resources, perceptual skill, language learning, and other aspects of the developed adult brain  and [[cognitive psychology]].  Qualitative differences between how a child processes its waking experience and how an adult processes his/her waking experience are acknowledged. Cognitive development is defined in adult terms as the emergence of ability to consciously cognize and consciously understand and articulate their understanding. From an adult point of view, cognitive development can also be called intellectual development &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel L|title=PSYCHOLOGY|year=2009|publisher=Catherine Woods|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|pages=429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of research has gone into understanding how a child perceives its world. [[Jean Piaget]] was a major force establishing this field, forming his "[[theory of cognitive development]]". Piaget proposed four stages of cognitive development: the ''sensorimotor'', ''preoperational'', ''concrete operational'' and ''formal operational'' period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel L|title=PSYCHOLOGY|year=2009|publisher=Catherine Woods|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|pages=430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Piaget's theoretical claims have since fallen out of favor. Still, his description of the most prominent changes in cognition with age, is generally still accepted today (e.g., how early perception moves from being dependent on concrete, external actions.  Later,  abstract understanding of observable aspects of reality can be captured; leading to, discovery of underlying abstract rules and principles, usually starting in adolescence)

Perhaps equally importantly, Piaget identified and described many cognitive changes that must be explained, such as [[object permanence]] in infancy and the understanding of logical relations and cause-effect reasoning in school age children. The many phenomena he described still attract the interest of many current researchers.

In recent years, however, alternative models have been advanced, including [[information-processing theory]], [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]], which aim to integrate Piaget's ideas with more recent models and concepts in developmental and cognitive science, theoretical cognitive neuroscience, and social-constructivist approaches.

A major controversy in cognitive development has been "[[nature versus nurture]]", that is, the question if cognitive development is mainly determined by an individual's innate qualities ("nature"), or by their personal experiences ("nurture"). However, it is now recognized by most experts that this is a [[false dichotomy]]: there is overwhelming evidence from biological and behavioral sciences that from the earliest points in development, gene activity interacts with events and experiences in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N.R. ''et al.''. (2005) Psychology: the science of behaviour (3rd Canadian ed) Pearson Ed. {{ISBN|0-205-45769-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive development and motor development may also be closely interrelated. When a person experiences a neurodevelopmental disorder and their cognitive development is disturbed, we often see adverse effects in motor development as well. Cerebellum, which is the part of brain that is most responsible for motor skills, has been shown to have significant importance in cognitive functions in the same way that prefrontal cortex has important duties in not only cognitive abilities but also development of motor skills. To support this, there is evidence of close co-activation of neocerebellum and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in functional neuroimaging as well as abnormalities seen in both cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in the same developmental disorder. In this way, we see close interrelation of motor development and cognitive development and they cannot operate in their full capacity when either of them are impaired or delayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Close Interrelation of Motor Development and Cognitive Development and of the Cerebellum and Prefrontal Cortex|first=Adele|last=Diamond|date=26 December 2017|publisher=|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=1|pages=44–56|jstor = 1132216|pmid = 10836557|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00117}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Historical origins: The history and theory of cognitive development. ==
 Jean Piaget is inexorably linked to cognitive development. It is clear that in Piaget's writings that there are influences from many historical predecessors. A few that are worth mentioning are included in the following Historical Origins chart. It is intended to be a more inclusive list of researchers who have studied the processes of acquiring more complex ways of thinking as people grow and develop:

=== Piaget's theory of cognitive development ===
{{Main|Piaget's theory of cognitive development}}
[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) believed that people move through stages of development that allow them to think in new, more complex ways.

==== Sensorimotor stage ====
The first stage in Piaget's stages of cognitive development is the sensorimotor stage. This stage lasts from birth to two years old. During this stage, behaviors lack a sense of thought and logic. Behaviors gradually move from acting upon inherited reflexes to interacting with the environment with a goal in mind and being able to represent the external world at the end.

The sensorimotor stage has been broken down into six sub stages that explain the gradual development of infants from birth to age 2. Once the child gains the ability to mentally represent reality, the child begins the transition to the preoperational stage of development.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;McShane, John. "Cognitive Development: an information processing approach". 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Birth to one month ====
Each child is born with inherited reflexes that they use to gain knowledge and understanding about their environment. ''Examples of these reflexes include grasping and sucking.''&lt;ref name="columbuscityschools.org"&gt;Freyder, C., &amp; Jackson, M. (2008). Sensorimotor Period. Retrieved November 20, 2012, from {{cite web |url=http://www.columbuscityschools.org/lee/pioneer/stage1.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106002021/http://www.columbuscityschools.org/lee/pioneer/stage1.htm |archivedate=2013-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1–4 months ====
Children repeat behaviors that happen unexpectedly because of their reflexes. ''For example, a child's finger comes in contact with the mouth and the child starts sucking on it. If the sensation is pleasurable to the child, then the child will attempt to recreate the behavior.''&lt;ref name="columbuscityschools.org" /&gt; Infants use their initial reflexes (grasping and sucking) to explore their environment and create schemes. [[Schema (psychology)|Schemes]] are groups of similar actions or thoughts that are used repeatedly in response to the environment.&lt;ref name="Ormrod, J.E. 2012"&gt;Ormrod, J.E. (2012). Essentials of Educational Psychology: Big Ideas to Guide Effective Teaching. Boston, MA: Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a child begins to create schemes they use accommodation and assimilation to become progressively adapted to the world.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, S. A. (2010). Sensorimotor Stage&amp;nbsp;— Object Permanence. Retrieved from http://www.simplypsychology.org/sensorimotor.html&lt;/ref&gt; '''Assimilation''' is when a child responds to a new event in a way that is consistent with an existing schema. ''For example, an infant may assimilate a new teddy bear into their putting things in their mouth scheme and use their reflexes to make the teddy bear go into their mouth.''&lt;ref name="Ormrod, J.E. 2012" /&gt; '''Accommodation''' is when a child either modifies an existing scheme or forms an entirely new schema to deal with a new object or event. ''For example, an infant may have to open his or her mouth wider than usual to accommodate the teddy bear's paw.''&lt;ref name="Ormrod, J.E. 2012" /&gt;

==== 5–8 months ====
Child has an experience with an external stimulus that they find pleasurable, so they try to recreate that experience. ''For example, a child accidentally hits the mobile above the crib and likes to watch it spin. When it stops the child begins to grab at the object to make it spin again.'' In this stage, habits are formed from general schemes that the infant has created but there is not yet, from the child's point of view, any differentiation between means and ends.&lt;ref name="Piaget, J. 1972"&gt;Piaget, J., &amp; Inhelder, B. (1972). The Psychology of the Child (Vol. 5001). Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Children cannot also focus on multiple tasks at once, and only focus on the task at hand.&lt;ref name="Ormrod, J.E. 2012" /&gt; The child may create a habit of spinning the mobile in its crib, but they are still trying to find out methods to reach the mobile in order to get it to spin in the way that they find pleasurable. Once there is another distraction (say the parent walks in the room) the baby will no longer focus on the mobile. Toys should be given to infants that respond to a child's actions to help foster their investigative instincts.&lt;ref&gt;Buckleitner, W. (2008). So Young, and So Gadgeted. Retrieved November 20, 2012, from https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''For example, a toy plays a song when you push one button, and then a picture pops up if you push another button.''

==== 8–12 months ====
Behaviors will be displayed for a reason rather than by chance. They begin to understand that one action can cause a reaction.&lt;ref name="columbuscityschools.org" /&gt; They also begin to understand '''object permanence''', which is the realization that objects continue to exist when removed form view. ''For example: The baby wants a rattle but the blanket is in the way. The baby moves the blanket to get the rattle. '' Now that the infant can understand that the object still exists, they can differentiate between the object, and the experience of the object. According to psychologist David Elkind, "An internal representation of the absent object is the earliest manifestation of the symbolic function which develops gradually during the second year of life whose activities dominate the next stage of mental growth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elkind | first1 = D | year = 1967 | title = Egocentrism in Adolescence | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 1025–1034 | doi=10.2307/1127100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 12–18 months ====
Actions occur deliberately with some variation. ''For example a baby drums on a pot with a wooden spoon, then drums on the floor, then on the table.''&lt;ref name="columbuscityschools.org" /&gt;

==== 18–24 months ====
Children begin to build mental symbols and start to participate in pretend play. ''For example, a child is mixing ingredients together but doesn't have a spoon so they pretend to use one or use another object the replace the spoon''.&lt;ref name="columbuscityschools.org" /&gt; '''Symbolic thought''' is a representation of objects and events as mental entities or symbols which helps foster cognitive development and the formation of imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Ormrod, J.E. (2012). ''Essentials of Educational Psychology: Big Ideas to Guide Effective Teaching''. Boston, MA: Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Piaget, the infant begins to act upon intelligence rather than habit at this point. The end product is established after the infant has pursued for the appropriate means. The means are formed from the schemes that are known by the child.&lt;ref name="Piaget, J. 1972" /&gt; The child is starting to learn how to use what it has learned in the first two years to develop and further explore their environment.

==== Preoperational stage ====
Lasts from 2 years of age until 6 or 7. It can be characterized in two somewhat different ways. In his early work, before he had developed his structuralist theory of cognition, Piaget described the child's thought during this period as being governed by principles such as '''egocentrism''', animism and other similar constructs. Egocentrism is when a child can only see a certain situation his or her own way. One can not comprehend that other people have other views and perceptions of scenarios. Animism is when an individual gives a lifeless object human-like qualities. An individual usually believes that this object has human emotions, thoughts and intentions. Once he had proposed his structuralist theory, Piaget characterized the preoperational child as lacking the cognitive structures possessed by the concrete operational child. The absence of these structures explains, in part, the behaviors Piaget had previously described as egocentric and animistic, for example, an inability to comprehend that another individual may have different emotional responses to similar experiences.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref name = Hurley&gt;Ann Hurley."Cognitive Development: Overview." pp. 2 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/psych406-5.3.pdf] Retrieved May 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage children also become increasingly adept at using symbols as evidenced by the increase in playing and pretending.

==== Concrete operational stage ====
Lasts from 6 or 7 years until about 12 or 13. During this stage, the child's cognitive structures can be characterized by reality. Piaget argues that the same general principles can be discerned in a wide range of behaviors. One of the best-known achievements of this stage is that of '''conservation'''. In a typical conservation experiment a child is asked to judge whether or not two quantities are the same&amp;nbsp;– such as two equal quantities of liquid in a short and tall glass. A preoperational child will typically judge the taller, thinner glass to contain more, while a concrete operational child will judge the amounts still to be the same. The ability to reason in this way reflects the development of a principle of conservation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

==== Formal operational stage ====
Lasts from 12 or 13 until adulthood and are advancing from logical reasoning with concrete examples to '''abstract examples'''. The need for concrete examples is no longer necessary because abstract thinking can be used instead. In this stage adolescents are also able to view themselves in the future and can picture the ideal life they would like to pursue. Some theorists believe the formal operational stage can be divided into two sub-categories: early formal operational and late formal operation thought. Early formal operational thoughts may be just fantasies, but as adolescents advance to late formal operational thought the life experiences they have encountered changes those fantasy thoughts to realistic thoughts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

==== Criticism ====
Many of his claims have fallen out of favor. For example, he claimed that young children cannot [[Conservation (psychology)|conserve]] numbers. However, further experiments showed that children did not really understand what was being asked of them. When the experiment is done with candies, and the children are asked which set they ''want'' rather than having to tell an adult which is more, they show no confusion about which group has more items.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Piaget's theory of cognitive development ends at the Formal Operational stage that is usually  developed in early adulthood. It does not take into account later stages of adult cognitive development as described by for example Harvard University professor [[Robert Kegan]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kegan|first1=Robert|title=The Evolving Self|date=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other theoretical perspectives on cognitive development ==

=== Speculated core systems of cognition ===
Empiricists study how these skills may be learned in such a short time. The debate is over whether these systems are learned by general-purpose learning devices, or domain-specific cognition. Moreover, many modern cognitive developmental psychologists, recognizing that the term "innate" does not square with modern knowledge about epigenesis, neurobiological development, or learning, favor a non-nativist framework. Researchers who discuss "core systems" often speculate about differences in thinking and learning between proposed domains.
Researchers who posit a set of so-called "core domains" suggest that children have an innate sensitivity to specific kinds of patterns of information. Those commonly cited include:

==== Number ====
Infants appear to have two systems for dealing with numbers. One deals with small numbers, often called [[subitizing and counting|subitizing]]. Another deals with larger numbers in an approximate fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Feigenson, L., Dehaene, S., Spelke, E. (2004). Core Systems of Number. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 8. 307-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Space ====
Very young children appear to have some skill in navigation. This basic ability to infer the direction and distance of unseen locations develops in ways that are not entirely clear. However, there is some evidence that it involves the development of complex language skills between 3 and 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;Ness, Daniel and Stephen J. Farenga. (2007). Knowledge under Construction: The Importance of Play in Developing Children's Spatial and Geometric Thinking. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is evidence that this skill depends importantly on visual experience, because congenitally blind individuals have been found to have impaired abilities to infer new paths between familiar locations.

==== Visual perception ====
One of the original nativist versus empiricist debates was over [[depth perception]]. There is some evidence that children less than 72 hours old can perceive such complex things as [[biological motion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simion | first1 = F. | last2 = Regolin | first2 = L. | last3 = Bulf | first3 = H. | year = 2008 | title = A predisposition for biological motion in the newborn baby | url = | journal = PNAS | volume = 105 | issue = 2| pages = 809–813 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0707021105| pmc = 2206618 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is unclear how visual experience in the first few days contributes to this perception. There are far more elaborate aspects of visual perception that develop during infancy and beyond.

==== Essentialism ====
Young children seem to be predisposed to think of biological entities (e.g., animals and plants) in an [[essentialism|essentialistic]] way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelman|first=S|title=The Essential Child: Origins of Essentialism in Everyday Thought|year=2003|isbn=0-19-518198-0|authorlink=Susan Gelman|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that they expect such entities (as opposed to, e.g., artifacts) to have many traits such as internal properties that are caused by some "essence" (such as, in our modern Western conceptual framework, the genome).

==== Language acquisition ====
A major, well-studied process and consequence of cognitive development is [[language acquisition]]. The traditional view was that this is the result of deterministic, human-specific genetic structures and processes. Other traditions, however, have emphasized the role of social experience in language learning. However, the relation of gene activity, experience, and language development is now recognized as incredibly complex and difficult to specify. Language development is sometimes separated into learning of phonology (systematic organization of sounds), morphology (structure of linguistic units—root words, affixes, parts of speech, intonation, etc.), syntax (rules of grammar within sentence structure), semantics (study of meaning), and discourse or pragmatics (relation between sentences). However, all of these aspects of language knowledge—which were originally posited by the linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] to be autonomous or separate—are now recognized to interact in complex ways.

==== Bilingualism ====
It wasn’t until recently that bilingualism had really been accepted as a contributing factor to cognitive development. Ellen Bialystok was, and is, a big game changer in this field. Bialystok has done years of research on the effects bilingualism has on cognitive development. There have been a number of studies showing how bilingualism contributes to the executive function of the brain, which is the main center at which cognitive development happens. According to Bialystok in “Bilingualism and the Development of Executive Function: The Role of Attention”, children who are bilingual, have to actively filter through the two different languages to select the one they need to use, which in turn makes the development stronger in that center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bialystok | first1 = Ellen | year = 2015 | title = Bilingualism And The Development Of Executive Function: The Role Of Attention | url = | journal = Child Development Perspectives | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 117–121 | doi=10.1111/cdep.12116| pmc = 4442091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whorf's hypothesis ===
{{Main|Linguistic relativity}}
[[Benjamin Whorf]] (1897–1941), while working as a student of [[Edward Sapir]], posited that a person's thinking depends on the structure and content of their social group's language. In other words, it is the belief that language determines our thoughts and perceptions. For example, it used to be thought that the Greeks, who wrote left to right, thought differently than Egyptians since the Egyptians wrote right to left. Whorf's theory was so strict that he believed if a word is absent in a language, then the individual is unaware of the object's existence.&lt;ref name="Hunt, E. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = E. | last2 = Agnoli | first2 = F. | year = 1991 | title = The Whorfian hypothesis: A cognitive psychology perspective | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 98 | issue = 3| pages = 377–389 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.98.3.377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was played out in George Orwell's book, Animal Farm; the pig leaders slowly eliminated words from the citizen's vocabulary so that they were incapable of realizing what they were missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mosenthal | first1 = P | year = 1975 | title = Language and thought | url = | journal = Theory Into Practice | volume = 14 | issue = 5| pages = 306–311 | doi = 10.1080/00405847509542592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Whorfian hypothesis failed to recognize that people can still be aware of the concept or item, even though they lack efficient coding to quickly identify the target information.&lt;ref name="Hunt, E. 1991" /&gt;

=== Quine's bootstrapping hypothesis ===
[[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (1908–2000) argued that there are [[Bootstrapping (linguistics)#Acquiring nouns|innate conceptual biases]] that enable the acquisition of language, concepts, and beliefs. Quine's theory follows nativist philosophical traditions, such as the European rationalist philosophers, for example [[Immanuel Kant]].

=== Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development ===
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}} Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development emphasized the role of information processing mechanisms in cognitive development, such as attention control and working memory. They suggested that progression along Piagetian stages or other levels of cognitive development is a function of strengthening of control mechanisms and enhancement of working memory storage capacity.

== Neuroscience ==
During development, especially the first few years of life, children show interesting patterns of [[neural development]] and a high degree of [[neuroplasticity]]. Neuroplasticity, as explained by The World Health Organization, can be summed in three points. 1.) Any adaptive mechanism used by the nervous system to repair itself after injury. 2.) Any means by which the nervous system can repair individually damaged central circuits. 3.) Any means by which the capacity of the central nervous system can adapt to new physiological conditions and environment. The relation of brain development and cognitive development is extremely complex and, since the 1990s, has been a growing area of research.

=== Cultural influences ===
From cultural psychologists' view, minds and culture shape each other. In other words, culture can influence brain structures which then influence our interpretation of the culture.
These examples reveal cultural variations in neural responses:

==== Figure-line task (Hedden et al., 2008) ====
Behavioral research has shown that one's strength in independent or interdependent tasks differ based on their cultural context. In general, East Asian cultures are more interdependent whereas Western cultures are more independent.{{clarify|date=March 2013}}&lt;!-- What are independent and interdependent cognitive tasks??--&gt; Hedden et al. assessed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses of East Asians and Americans while they performed independent (absolute) or interdependent (relative) tasks. The study showed that participants used regions of the brain associated with attentional control when they had to perform culturally incongruent tasks. In other words, neural paths used for the same task were different for Americans and East Asians (Hedden et al., 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedden | first1 = T. | last2 = Ketay | first2 = S. | last3 = Aron | first3 = A. | last4 = Markus | first4 = H. R. | last5 = Gabrieli | first5 = J. D. E. | year = 2008 | title = Cultural influences on neural substrates of attentional control | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 12–17 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02038.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kobayashi et al., 2007 ====
Kobayashi et al. compared American-English monolingual and Japanese-English bilingual children's brain responses in understanding others' intentions through [[false-belief]] story and cartoon tasks. They found universal activation of the region bilateral [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] in [[theory of mind]] tasks. However, American children showed greater activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus during the tasks whereas Japanese children had greater activity in right inferior frontal gyrus during the Japanese Theory of Mind tasks. In conclusion, these examples suggest that the brain's neural activities are not universal but are culture dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobayashi | first1 = C. | last2 = Glover | first2 = G.

[[Image:Cold Trap.PNG|frame|Cold trap immersed in cold medium in Dewar flask. Some workers prefer the opposite arrangement, where vapors flow down the wall of the trap, and are sucked up the inner tube; this reduces blockage.&lt;ref name = errington&gt;{{cite book |author=Errington, R.

In [[vacuum]] applications, a '''cold trap''' is a device that condenses all [[vapor]]s except the permanent gases into a liquid or solid.&lt;ref name=HarwoodMoodyEOCPAP&gt;{{cite book
|author = Laurence M. Harwood, Christopher J. Moody
|title = Experimental organic chemistry: Principles and Practice

|ISBN=978-0-632-02017-1 
|date=13 Jun 1989
|publisher=WileyBlackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common objective is to prevent vapors being evacuated from an experiment from entering a [[vacuum pump]] where they would condense and contaminate it.  Particularly large cold traps are necessary when removing large amounts of liquid as in [[freeze drying]].

Cold traps also refer to the application of cooled surfaces or [[Baffle (in vessel)|baffles]] to prevent oil vapours from flowing from a pump and into a chamber. In such a case, a baffle or a section of pipe containing a number of cooled vanes, will be attached to the inlet of an existing pumping system. By cooling the baffle, either with a cryogen such as liquid nitrogen, or by use of an electrically driven [[Peltier effect|Peltier]] element, oil vapour molecules that strike the baffle vanes will condense and thus be removed from the pumped cavity.

==Applications==
Pumps that use oil either as their working fluid ([[diffusion pump]]s), or as their lubricant (mechanical rotary pumps), are often the sources of contamination in vacuum systems. Placing a cold trap at the mouth of such a pump greatly lowers the risk that oil vapours will backstream into the cavity.

Cold traps can also be used for experiments involving vacuum lines such as small-scale very low temperature [[distillation]]s/[[condensation]]s.  This is accomplished through the use of a coolant such as [[liquid nitrogen]] or a [[freezing mixture]] of [[dry ice]] in [[acetone]] or a similar solvent with a low [[melting point]].

When performed on a larger scale, this technique is called freeze-drying, and the cold trap is referred to as the condenser.

Cold traps are also used in [[cryopump]] systems to generate hard vacua by condensing the major constituents of the atmosphere ([[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[water]]) into their liquid or solid forms.
{{main|cryopump}}

== Hazards ==
Care should be taken when using a cold trap not to condense [[liquid oxygen]] (a light blue liquid) into the cold trap. Liquid oxygen is potentially explosive, and this is especially true if the trap has been used to trap solvent. Liquid oxygen can be condensed into a cold trap if a pump has sucked air through the trap when the trap is very cold, e.g. when cooled with [[liquid nitrogen]]. Besides oxygen, many hazardous gases emitted in reactions, e.g. [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chloromethane]], condense into cold traps.

==Construction==
[[File:Wymrażacz ubt.svg|right|thumb]]
Cold traps (C in the figure) usually consist of two parts: The bottom is a large, thick round tube with ground-glass joints (B in the figure), and the second is a cap (A in the figure), also with ground-glass connections. The length of the tube is usually selected so that, when assembled, the total reached is about half the length of the tube.

==Arrangement==

Cold traps should be assembled such that the down tube is connected to the source of gas whilst the cap is connected to the source of vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/aldrich/z219738?lang=en&amp;region=GB An Aldrich manifold including a preformed cold trap]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemglass.com/product_view.asp?pnr=AF-0203 A preformed cold trap from Chemglass]&lt;/ref&gt; Reversing this, connecting the down tube to the source of vacuum, places the inlet of the vacuum directly above the condensate, increasing the chances of vapour phase condensate moving up the (uncooled) down tube (towards the pump) or, should the trap begin to fill to an appreciable volume, liquid phase condensate being pulled into the pump.

A '''concept of operations''' (abbreviated '''CONOPS''', '''CONOPs''',&lt;ref name="hhsde"/&gt; or '''ConOps'''&lt;ref name="hhs"/&gt;) is a document describing the characteristics of a proposed [[system]] from the viewpoint of an individual who will use that system like a [[Business requirements|business requirements specification]] or [[stakeholder requirements specification (StRS)]]. It is used to communicate the [[quantitative property|quantitative]] and [[qualitative property|qualitative]] system characteristics to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]]s.&lt;ref name="hhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/ConOps.pdf|title=Concept of Operations (ConOps)|publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2008-06-22|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611232934/http://www3.cms.hhs.gov/SystemLifecycleFramework/Downloads/ConOps.pdf|archive-date=2009-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; CONOPS are widely used in the military, governmental services and other fields.

A CONOPS generally evolves from a [[concept]] and is a description of how a set of [[capability (systems engineering)|capabilities]] may be employed to achieve desired [[objective (goal)|objective]]s or [[End States|end state]].&lt;ref name="hhsde"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/disasters/discussion/planners/conops.html |title=CONOPS |publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services |accessdate=2008-06-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408092628/http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/discussion/planners/conops.html |archivedate=2008-04-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first standard was ''1362-1998 - IEEE Guide for Information Technology - System Definition - Concept of Operations (ConOps) Document'' that was superseded by the document ''29148-2011 - ISO/IEC/IEEE International Standard - Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes --Requirements engineering''.
Then came the 2012 AIAA revision proposal ''Guide: Guide to the Preparation of Operational Concept Documents (ANSI/AIAA G-043A-2012) (Revision of G-043-1992)'', and today we have ''ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 Systems and software engineering -- System life cycle processes''.

In the field of joint [[military operations]], a CONOPS in [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] terminology is a verbal or graphic statement that clearly and concisely expresses what the joint force commander intends to accomplish and how it will be done using available resources.&lt;ref name="JP5-0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp5_0.pdf|title=Joint Publication 5-0; Joint Operation Planning|accessdate=2012-08-14|format=PDF|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903220959/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp5_0.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JP1-02"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf|title=Joint Publication 1-02; Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms|accessdate=2012-08-14|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CONOPS may also be used or summarized in system acquisition [[DODAF]] descriptions such as the [[Operational_View#High-Level_Operational_Concept_Graphic|OV-1 High Level Operational Concept Graphic]]&lt;ref name="dodaf slides"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dodcio.defense.gov/Portals/0/Documents/DODAF/DoD_EA_Conf_SAR_DoDAF_in_Action.ppt|title=DODAF in Action|format=PPT}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Description==
Concept of Operations documents can be developed in many different ways, but usually share the same properties. In general, a CONOPS will include the following:&lt;ref name="carnegie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sei.cmu.edu/productlines/ppl/concept_of_operations.html|title=Concept of Operations|year=2008|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|accessdate=2008-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Statement of the [[goal]]s and [[objective (goal)|objective]]s of the system
* [[Strategy|Strategies]], tactics, [[policy|policies]], and constraints affecting the system
* [[Organization]]s, activities, and interactions among participants and stakeholders
* Clear statement of [[Professional responsibility|responsibilities]] and [[authority|authorities]] delegated
* Specific [[Business operations|operational]] [[Business process|process]]es for fielding the system
* Processes for initiating, developing, maintaining, and retiring the system

A CONOPS should relate a [[narrative]] of the process to be followed in [[Implementation|implementing]] a system. It should define the roles of the stakeholders involved throughout the process. Ideally it offers clear [[methodology]] to realize the goals and objectives for the system, while not intending to be an implementation or transition plan itself.&lt;ref name="carnegie"/&gt;

A CONOPS Standard is available to guide the development of a CONOPS document.&lt;ref name="ieeestd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standards.ieee.org/reading/ieee/std_public/description/se/1362-1998_desc.html|title=IEEE Std 1362-1998 IEEE Guide for Information Technology—System Definition—Concept of Operations (ConOps) Document|publisher=IEEE Standards Association|accessdate=2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=5966380
|title=IEEE Std 29148-2011 - Systems and software engineering -- Life cycle processes --Requirements engineering}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) Standard is structured around [[information systems]], but the standard may be applied to other complex systems as well.

'''DIPS (Digital Image Processing with Sound)''' is a set of plug-in objects that handle real-time [[digital image processing]] in [[Max (software)|Max/MSP]] programming environment. Combining with the built-in objects of the environment, DIPS enables to program the interaction between audio and visual events with ease, and supports the realization of interactive multimedia art as well as interactive computer music.

== Summary of Features ==
*A plug-in software for Max/MSP (Max 5 and 6)
*More than 300 Max external objects and abstractions
*More than 90 OpenGL objects included
*More than 110 visual effect objects (Dfx library, Core Image Filters)
*A utility library for the easy of programming (prefix Dlib)
*A comprehensive set of sample patches, and a detailed tutorial
*Handling images &amp; movie files ([[QuickTime]], [[OpenGL]])
*Render and move 3D models ([[OpenGL]])
*Video signal input ([[QuickTime]], video texture)
*Video input analysis: motion detect, face tracking ([[OpenCV]], [[OpenGL]])
*Importing 3D models (.obj file)
*Importing [[Quartz Composer]] files
*OpenGL Shading Language ([[GLSL]]) programming interface
*Easy integration of visual events using DIPSWindowMixer ([[OpenGL]])

== Description ==
DIPS is a free plug-in software (a set of external objects) for Max/MSP. It supports the designing of the interaction between sound and visual events in Max using Apple’s [[Core Image]], [[OpenGL]] and [[OpenCV]] technologies, and consequently, provides a powerful and user-friendly programming environment for the creation of interactive multimedia art.

DIPS can be used to detect a performer’s motions and to track positions of subtle details, such as the face, mouth, and eyes. It can also be used to measure the distance between objects and a Kinect sensor system, and offers powerful tools for realtime image processing of incoming video stream and stored movie files. In addition, it can be used to create complex images in a virtual three-dimensional space.

The DIPS consists of a library of more than 300 Max external objects and abstractions, a comprehensive set of sample patches, and a detailed tutorial. Some of its strong points, in comparison with other similar plug-ins and software, are its ease of programming, power, and efficiency.

The sample patches and tutorial contained in the installation package allows composers and artists who are interested in the creation of interactive art to realize sophisticated realtime video effects on a live video signal at their first practice. And because of its ease of programming, it is likely that one will soon acquire skills needed to create state-of-the-art interactive performance works, multimedia installations, interactive multimedia artworks, and Max VJ applications using DIPS.

== History ==
Initially developed by Shu Matsuda in 1997, DIPS was a plug-in software for [[Max (software)#History|Max/FTS]] running on [[SGI Octane]] and [[SGI O2|O2]] computers. Since 2000, it has been developed by the DIPS Development Group supervised by Takayuki Rai. Current active group members are Shu Matsuda, Yota Morimoto, Takuto Fukuda, and Keitaro Takahashi. Previously, Chikashi Miyama, Daichi Ando and Takayuki Hamano also contributed to its development.

==Theory==
Difference theory has roots in the studies of [[John Gumperz]], who examined differences in cross-cultural communication. While difference theory deals with cross-gender communication, the male and female genders are often presented as being two separate cultures, hence the relevance of Gumperz's studies. In her development of the difference theory, Deborah Tannen drew on the work of Daniel Maltz and Ruth Borker, in particular their 1982 paper, ''A Cultural Approach to Male-Female Miscommunication'', which itself drew on the work of Gumperz.&lt;ref&gt;Sunderland, ''Language and Gender: An advanced resource book'', pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Talbot makes reference to the term "gender-specific culture" in her critique of the difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; and this idea of genders being culturally separated is embodied by the 1992 publication ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, ''Communication between Men and Women in the Context of the Christian Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Difference theory is often compared with dominance theory and deficit theory, and together with the more contemporary dynamic theory they make up four of the theories most widely referred to and compared in the study of [[language and gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', pp. 130-133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, ''Women, Men and Language'', pp. 12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for the popularity of Tannen's book ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]'', and the resultant popularisation of difference theory,&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Talbot98"&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; is generally attributed to the style of Tannen's work, in which she adopts a neutral position on differences in [[genderlect]] by making no value-judgements about use of language by either gender. Talbot comments that this means the book provides explanations for domestic disputes without "pointing the finger" at anyone.&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, ''Language and Gender'', p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference theory as postulated by Tannen is generally summarised into six categories, each of which pairs contrasting uses of language by males and females.&lt;ref name="Talbot98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Deborah Tannen and difference''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status v. support===
Tannen states that, for men, the world is a competitive place in which conversation and speech are used to build status, whereas for women the world is a network of connections, and that they use language to seek and offer support. In demonstrating this, Tannen uses the example of her husband and herself, who at one point had jobs in different cities. She remarks that whenever someone commented on this, she interpreted it as being an offer of sympathy or support. Her husband, on the other hand, took such comments as being criticisms and attempts to put him down. Tannen remarks that this displays the different approaches that women and men take in terms of status and support. Furthermore, men are also more likely to interrupt to get their point across and hence gain status.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding v. advice===
Women seek comfort and sympathy for their problems, whilst men will seek a solution to the problem.

===Information v. feelings===
Tannen states that men's conversation is message-oriented, i.e. based upon communicating information. For women, conversation is much more important for building relationships and strengthening social links.

===Orders v. proposals===
Men will use direct imperatives ("close the door", "switch on the light") when speaking to others. Women encourage the use of superpolite forms, however ("let's", "would you mind if ...?").

===Conflict v. compromise===
Tannen asserts that most women avoid conflict in language at all costs, and instead attempt to resolve disagreements without any direct confrontation, to maintain positive connection and rapport. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to use confrontation as a way of resolving differences and thereby negotiating status. Tannen supports this view by making reference to the work of [[Walter J. Ong]], whose 1981 publication, ''Fighting for Life'', asserts that "expressed adversativeness" is more an element of male culture than female culture. Tannen stresses that both forms of communication are valid ways of creating involvement and forming bonds.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence v. intimacy===
Difference theory asserts that in general men favour independence, while women are more likely to seek intimacy. Tannen demonstrates this with the example of a husband making a decision without consulting his wife. She theorises that he does so because he doesn't want to feel a loss of independence that would come from saying, "Let me consult this with my wife first." Women, by contrast, like to demonstrate that they have to consult with their partner, as this is seen to be proof of the intimacy of the relationship. Tannen asserts that women, seeing the world as a network of connections and relationships, view intimacy as key to achieving consensus and avoiding the appearance of superiority, whereas men, who are more likely to view the world in terms of status, see independence as being key to establishing their status. Tannen also clarifies that while both men and women seek independence and intimacy, men tend to be focused on the former, while women tend to focus on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Tannen, ''You Just Don't Understand'', pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

General criticisms are that Tannen's observations are largely anecdotal and cannot be said for all conjugal conversations, let alone mixed-gender interactions as a whole.

'''Edwards Air Force Base''' ('''AFB''') {{airport codes|EDW|KEDW|EDW}} is a [[United States Air Force installation]] located in [[Kern County]] in [[Southern California|southern]] [[California]], about {{convert|22|mi}} northeast of [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] and {{convert|15|mi}} east of [[Rosamond, California|Rosamond]].

It is the home of the [[Air Force Test Center]], [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|Air Force Test Pilot School]], and [[NASA]]'s [[Armstrong Flight Research Center]]. It is the [[Air Force Materiel Command]] center for conducting and supporting research and development of flight, as well as testing and evaluating aerospace systems from concept to combat. It also hosts many test activities conducted by America's commercial aerospace industry.

==Overview==
[[File:Glen edwards.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Capt. [[Glen Edwards (pilot)|Glen Edwards]]]]
Previously known as [[Muroc, California|Muroc]] Air Force Base, Edwards AFB is named in honor of [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Glen Edwards (pilot)|Glen Edwards]] (1918–1948). During [[World War II]], he flew [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20 Havoc]] light attack bombers in the [[North African Campaign|North African campaign]] on 50 hazardous, low-level missions against German tanks, convoys, troops, bridges, airfields, and other tactical targets. Edwards became a [[test pilot]] in 1943 and spent much of his time at Muroc Army Air Field, on California's high desert, testing wide varieties of experimental prototype aircraft. He died in the crash of a [[Northrop YB-49]] [[flying wing]] near Muroc AFB on 5 June 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Daniel: Glen Edwards: The Diary of a Bomber Pilot (Washington: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1998) {{ISBN|1-56098-571-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The base is next to [[Rogers Dry Lake]], an [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] desert [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pan]] whose hard [[dry lake]] surface provides a natural extension to Edwards' [[runway]]s. This large landing area, combined with excellent year-round weather, makes the base good for flight testing.  The lake is a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name="nhlsum"&gt;[http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceID=1933&amp;resourceType=Site NHL Summary for Rogers Dry Lake] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204115836/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceID=1933&amp;resourceType=Site |date=4 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The base has helped develop virtually every aircraft purchased by the Air Force since World War II. Almost every [[United States Armed Forces|United States]] [[military aviation|military aircraft]] since the 1950s has been at least partially tested at Edwards, and it has been the site of many aviation breakthroughs.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Notable occurrences at Edwards include [[Chuck Yeager]]'s flight that broke the [[sound barrier]] in the [[Bell X-1]],{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=5}} test flights of the [[North American X-15]],{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=5}} the first landings of the [[Space Shuttle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flying Machine|page=9|date=April 15, 1982|newspaper=Star-Gazette|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17465918/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1986 around-the-world flight of the [[Rutan Voyager]].

===Associate units===
There are a vast array of organizations at Edwards that do not fall under the 412th Test Wing. They are known as Associate Units. These units do everything from providing an on-base grocery store to testing state-of-the-art rockets.
[[File:31st Test and Evaluation Squadron Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II 09-5007.jpg|thumb|31st Test and Evaluation Squadron Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II 09-5007]]

==== [[31st Test and Evaluation Squadron]] (Tail Code: OT)====
: The 31st Test and Evaluation Squadron provides [[Air Combat Command]] personnel to support combined test and evaluation on Air Force weapons systems.  Established in 1917, it is one of the oldest units of the United States Air Force.   The "Desert Pirates" are part of the [[53d Test and Evaluation Group]], [[Nellis AFB]], [[Nevada]] and the [[53d Wing]], [[Eglin AFB]], [[Florida]].   It also provides the [[Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center]], [[Kirtland AFB]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Air Force Materiel Command]], [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], [[Ohio]], with test team members who have an operational perspective to perform test and evaluation on Combat Air Force systems.

: The 31st is staffed with a mixture of operations, maintenance and engineering experts who plan and conduct tests, evaluate effectiveness and suitability, and influence system design. The squadron's personnel are integrated into the B-1, B-2, B-52, Global Hawk, MQ-9 and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programs. Their results and conclusions support Department of Defense acquisition, deployment and employment decisions.
[[File:Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Detachment 5 with RQ-4 Global Hawk.jpg|thumb|AFOTEC Detachment 5 personnel stand in front of a RQ-4 Global Hawk.]]

==== [[Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center]], Detachment 1.====
: An Air Force Materiel Command named unit assigned to Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, AFOTEC Detachment 1 is responsible for accomplishing Block 2 and 3 Initial Operational Test and Evaluation of the F-35 Lightning II for the US Air Force, [[United States Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps]], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom Ministry of Defense]], and the [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]].

==== Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center, Detachment 5.** ====
: AFOTEC Detachment 5 is responsible for conducting the operational test and evaluation of USAF aircraft and avionics systems.  Certification by Detachment 5 is required in advance prior to new aircraft prior to AFMC full rate production and combat fielding decisions.  Detachment 5 personnel are integrated into the Flight Test Center's combined test squadrons and provide a critical operating perspective during developmental flight testing to help prepare systems for their final operational test and evaluation.
: {{small|** Note: An AFOTEC Detachment 3 is an unconfirmed geographically separated unit, which may be assigned to a remote facility of Edwards AFB at [[Groom Lake]], Nevada, that may perform similar testing as Detachment 5 on weapons systems not publicly identified. During 1978 and 1979, an AFFTC test pilot and a pair of flight test engineers were engaged in proof-of-concept testing with Lockheed's "low-observable" technology demonstrator, dubbed "Have Blue".  The successful conduct of these tests led immediately to the development of the [[F-117A Nighthawk]], the world's first operational stealth fighter.}}
[[File:B-2 Sprirt Rollout - 22 November 1988.jpg|thumb|Northrop B-2A roll-out ceremony on Nov. 22, 1988 at USAF Plant 42, Palmdale, California.]]

==== [[Air Force Plant 42]] Production Flight Test Installation ====
: A remote facility of Edwards AFB, located at Palmdale, California, Plant 42 is a government-owned, contractor-operated facility with proximity to both the concentration of aerospace industry in Los Angeles, and the high-speed corridors and resources of the 412th Test Wing at Edwards.  Plant 42 is one of four Air Force plants located throughout the United States, and is uniquely situated to fully support the Air Force's newest and most advanced aerospace systems. It provides industrial facilities for production, modification, depot maintenance and flight testing of aerospace systems. It is staffed by a mixture of civilian defense contractors, as well as USAF personnel.

==== NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center ====
{{Main|Armstrong Flight Research Center}}
[[File:Collection of military aircraft.jpg|thumb|Armstrong Flight Research Center fleet in 1997]]
: Contained inside Edwards Air Force Base is NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) where modern aircraft research is still active (e.g. the [[Boeing X-45]]). The AFRC is home to many of the world's most advanced aircraft. Notable recent research projects include the [[Controlled Impact Demonstration]] and the [[LASRE|Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment]].  It is chartered to research and test advanced aeronautics, space and related technologies for atmospheric flight operations, and to transfer those technologies to industry and other government agencies. Armstrong supports NASA's Earth science research with a fleet of specialized manned and unmanned environmental science aircraft. Armstrong is also involved in NASA's space science mission by managing and flying the [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]]. The center is named for [[Neil Armstrong|Neil A. Armstrong]], an American astronaut and the first person to walk on the Moon. Armstrong's history dates back to late 1946, when 13 engineers arrived at what is now Edwards from the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics|NACA]] [[Langley Research Center|Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory]] in [[Virginia]] to support the last supersonic research flights by the X-1 rocket plane in a joint NACA, Army Air Forces and Bell Aircraft program.

==== Air Force Rocket Research Laboratory ====
[[File:Air Force Rocket Research Laboratory - Edwards AFB.jpg|right|thumb|Air Force Rocket Research Laboratory Edwards AFRL site]]
: The [[Air Force Research Laboratory#Propulsion Directorate|Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Propulsion Directorate]] maintains a [[rocket engine test facility]] on and around Leuhman Ridge, just east of Rogers Dry Lake. This facility traces its roots to early Army Air Corps activities. The Edwards Research Site is part of the AFRL Propulsion Directorate, which is headquartered at the Wright Research Site, [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], [[Ohio]].

==== Other units and further details ====
Edwards is also home to several other units from [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[FAA]], [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] and many companies that support the primary mission or the personnel stationed there.&lt;ref name="EBG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edwards.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070103-051.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219124227/http://www.edwards.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070103-051.pdf |archivedate=19 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }} "Edwards Base Guide"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Origins ===
A [[water stop]] on the [[Santa Fe Railroad]] since 1882, the site was largely unsettled until the early 20th century. In 1910, Ralph, Clifford and Effie Corum built a homestead on the edge of Rogers Lake. The Corums proved instrumental in attracting other settlers and building infrastructure in the area, and when a [[post office]] was commissioned for the area, they named it Muroc, a reversal of the Corum name, due to the presence of a town named Coram.&lt;ref name="HIST"&gt;[http://www.mybaseguide.com/article/air-force/edwards-afb/1834/History Edwards AFB office of history via My Base Guide to Edwards AFB]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coram was a smelter town established on the [[Sacramento River]] in 1906 about 1.6 km below what is today [[Shasta Dam]], in northern California.  It was abandoned around 1911 when the Balaklala Mine was closed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conscious that [[March Air Reserve Base|March Field]] was located in an area of increasing growth in [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]], and with the need for bombing and gunnery ranges for his units, base and [[1st Bombardment Wing|1st Wing]] commander [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry H. "Hap" Arnold]] began the process of acquiring land next to [[Rogers Dry Lake|Muroc Dry Lake]] for a new bombing range away from populated areas in August 1932; the last tract was not acquired until 1939. The facility established to support the range, initially called "Mohave Field" for the nearby community of [[Mojave, California|Mohave]], was Muroc Field.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt; In October 1935, five men under a Sergeant Folgleman were sent to the area from March Field.  They put out circular bombing targets in the desert.  For the next two years aircraft shuttled back and forth between Muroc Dry Lake and March Field for Crew Bombing Practice.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"&gt;[http://documents.theblackvault.com/documents/afhistory/AFFTC1961Opt.pdf K286.69-37, Volume 1, January through June 1961  History of the Air Force Flight Test Center,  IRIS  Number 489391]&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, another colorful character in Edwards' history, [[Pancho Barnes]], built her renowned [[Happy Bottom Riding Club|Rancho Oro Verde Fly-Inn Dude Ranch]] that would be the scene of many parties and celebrations to come. The dry lake was a hive of hot rodding, with racing on the playa. The runway on which the Space Shuttle landed follows the route that hosted racing in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

The first major aerial activity occurred at Muroc in 1937 when the entire [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] participated in a large-scale maneuver. From then on, the bombing range grew in size.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;  When Arnold became Chief of the Air Corps in 1938, the service was given a renewed focus on [[research and development]]. Muroc Field drew attention, because the nearby dry lake was so flat (Arnold described it as "level as a billiard table") that it could serve as a giant runway, ideal for flight testing.  Over [[United States dollar|US$]]120 million was spent to develop the base in the 1940s and expand it to {{convert|301000|acre|sqmi km2}}. The base's main {{convert|15000|ft|adj=on}} runway was completed in a single pour of concrete.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

===World War II===
{{kml}}
On the afternoon of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|7 December 1941]], the [[41st Bombardment Group]] and the 6th Reconnaissance Squadron moved to Muroc from [[Davis-Monthan Army Airfield]], [[Arizona]], with a collection of [[B-18 Bolo]]s, [[B-25 Mitchell]]s, and an [[A-29 Hudson]].  On Christmas Eve, the 30th Bombardment Group and the 2d Reconnaissance Squadron  arrived from [[New Orleans Army Airbase]], [[Louisiana]], for crew training. On 23 July 1942, the Muroc Bombing and Gunnery Range, Muroc Lake, California, was designated as a separate post (Exempted Status).&lt;ref&gt;Hq Fourth AF G0 No. 83, 23 July 1942&lt;/ref&gt;  The name of the facility at the time was "Army Air Base, Muroc Lake".&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

In July 1942, '''Muroc Army Airfield''' became a separate airfield from March Field and was placed under the jurisdiction of [[Fourth Air Force]]. Throughout the war years, the primary mission at Muroc was providing final combat training for bomber and fighter aircrews just before overseas deployment. Among its sub-bases and auxiliaries were:
* [[Bishop Army Airfield]] {{Coord|37|22|23|N|118|21|49|W}}
* [[Blythe Army Airfield]]  {{Coord|33|37|09|N|114|43|00|W}}
* [[Palmdale Army Airfield]]  {{Coord|33|37|46|N|118|05|04|W}}
* [[Desert Center Army Airfield]]   {{Coord|33|44|52|N|115|19|31|W}}
* [[Gary Army Airfield]] {{Coord|33|40|45|N|114|38|36|W}}

Muroc was initially used for [[IV Bomber Command]] Operational Unit training. The [[B-25 Mitchell]] 41st and 30th Bombardment Groups and the [[A-20 Havoc]] 47th Bombardment Groups trained at the station in early 1942. The training provided newly graduated pilots eight to 12 weeks of training as a team using the same aircraft they would use in combat. In 1942, the training mission was transferred to [[IV Fighter Command]], with [[P-38 Lightning]] OTU training for the 78th and 81st Fighter Groups. In 1943, the 360th Fighter Group and 382d Bombardment Groups were assigned permanently to Muroc for P-38 Lightning and [[B-24 Liberator]] Replacement Training (RTU) of personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, Maurer (1983).

[[File:Bell P-59 Airacomet 060913-F-1234P-013.jpg|thumb|Bell P-59A (AAF Ser. No. 44-22609, the first United States jet fighter) and a [[P-63 Kingcobra]] (AAF Ser. No. 42-69417) in flight, 1944.]]
In spring 1942, the Mojave Desert station was chosen as a secluded site for testing America's first jet, the super-secret [[Bell Aircraft]] [[P-59 Airacomet]] jet fighter. The immense volume of flight test being conducted at Wright Field, in Ohio, helped drive a search for a new, isolated site where a "Top Secret" airplane could undergo tests "away from prying eyes." The urgent need to complete the P-59 program without delay dictated a location with good, year-round flying weather, and the risks inherent in the radical new technology to be demonstrated on the aircraft dictated a spacious landing field. After examining a number of locations around the country, they selected a site along the north shore of the enormous, flat surface of Rogers Dry Lake about six miles away from the training base at Muroc.&lt;ref name="HIST" /&gt;[[File:XP-80A Gray Ghost af.jpg|thumb|left|Lockheed XP-80A "Gray Ghost", 1945]]
Ground tests began five days after the first XP-59 arrived on 21 September 1942. First flight took place on 30 September when the XP-59 rose to {{Convert|10|feet|}} altitude for {{Convert|0.5|mile|}} during taxi testing.  However, the first official flight was 1 October 1942 with NACA, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, [[Royal Air Force]], Army, Bell and [[General Electric]] personnel on hand.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daso"&gt;{{cite book|title=Architects of American Air Supremacy: General [[Hap Arnold]] and Dr [[Theodore von Kármán]]|last=Daso|first=Dik A. (Major, USAF)|date=September 1997|publisher=[[Air University Press]]|pages=75,77,420}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|77}}

As with virtually all of the test programs conducted during the war years, most of the actual flight test work on the P-59 was conducted by the contractor. Although Army Air Forces (AAF) pilots flew the aircraft from time to time, and flight test engineers from Wright Field reviewed the data, the formal preliminary military test and evaluation program did not commence until the Fall of 1943, a year after the first flight. Designed to validate the contractor's reports, this preliminary evaluation consisted of a very limited number of flights and was essentially completed within a month. Formal operational suitability and accelerated service tests did not get underway until 1944, well after the AAF had decided that the airplane would not be suitable for combat operations and would, instead, be relegated to a training role.&lt;ref name="HIST" /&gt;

The P-59s were tested at Muroc from October 1942 through February 1944 without a single accident and, though the aircraft did not prove to be combat worthy, the successful conduct of its test program, combined with the success of the Lockheed XP-80 program which followed it in early 1944, sealed the future destiny of the remote high desert installation. Muroc would thenceforth become synonymous with the cutting edge of the turbojet revolution in America.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

Aircraft testing continued at this desert "Army Air Base", then on 8 November 1943, the base title was changed to "Muroc Army Air Field, Muroc".&lt;ref&gt;Hq Fourth AF G0 No. 188, 26 Nov 1943&lt;/ref&gt;   In the fall of 1944, [[Eighth Air Force]] ran tests to determine how well conventional fighters stood up against jets. Also, in October 1944, a small detachment arrived at the base for experimental work in rocket firing and achieved such success that they remained through most of 1945.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

Other World War II test flights included the [[Northrop JB-1 Bat]].

In 1943, a replica of a Japanese cruiser, nicknamed "[[Muroc Maru]]", was constructed in Rogers Dry Lake where it was used for bombing training until 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/rogers-dry-lake.htm|title=Rogers Dry Lake|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar era===
[[File:Chuck Yeager.jpg|thumb|Chuck Yeager next to experimental aircraft Bell X-1 #1, ''Glamorous Glennis'', 1947]]
With the end of the war, Fourth Air Force relinquished command of Muroc Army Airfield on 16 October 1945 and jurisdiction was transferred to [[Air Technical Service Command]], becoming [[Air Materiel Command]] in 1946.  Test work on the Lockheed [[P-80 Shooting Star]] was the primary mission of the base for the greater part of the fall of 1945.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;  The [[Consolidated Vultee XP-81]] single seat, long range escort fighter and Republic [[XP-84 Thunderjet]] fighter arrived at the base in early 1946 for flight testing.  It was obvious even at this embryonic stage of base development that the Army Air Force desert station was destined to become a proving ground for aircraft and a testing site for experimental airplanes.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

The success of these programs attracted a new type of research activity to the base in late 1946. The rocket-powered [[Bell X-1]] was the first in a long series of experimental airplanes designed to prove or disprove aeronautical concepts—to probe the most challenging unknowns of flight and solve its mysteries.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;  Further evidence of things to come was experienced on 14 October 1947 when Captain. [[Chuck Yeager|Charles "Chuck" Yeager]] flew the small bullet-shaped airplane to become the first human to exceed the speed of sound.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;
[[File:YB49-6 300.jpg|thumb|left| Northrop YB-49 taking off for the first time on 21 October 1947]]
Four months later, on 10 February 1948, Muroc AAF was re-designated Muroc Air Force Base with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate military service. Units attached or assigned to the base at the time were the 4144th Army Air Force Base Unit, the 3208th Strategic Bomb Test Squadron along with communications and weather detachments.   On 20 August 1948, the 4144th Air Force Base Unit was re-designated as the 2759th AF Base Unit and with the adoption of the [[Hobson Plan]], as the 2759th Experimental Wing.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

With the X-1, flight testing at Muroc began to assume two distinct identities. Highly experimental research programs—such as the X-3, X-4, X-5 and XF-92A—were typically flown in conjunction with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, or NACA, and were conducted in a methodical fashion to answer largely theoretical questions. Then, as now, the great bulk of flight testing at Muroc focused on evaluations of the capabilities of aircraft and systems proposed for the operational inventory.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

In December 1949, Muroc was renamed '''Edwards Air Force Base''' in honor of Captain [[Glen Edwards (pilot)|Glen Edwards]], who was killed a year earlier in the crash of the [[Northrop YB-49]] Flying Wing.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt; From the time Edwards Air Force Base was named, speed and altitude records began to pile up as new aircraft were developed and the base started to build and branch out significantly.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

A major reason for the growth of Edwards AFB was the nearness of West Coast aircraft manufacturers.  However, another major reason was the decision in 1947 to build a missile test facility on the base.   The need for a static missile faculty to test high-thrust missile rocket engines was first envisioned in 1946 by the Power Plant Laboratory at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].  It was that decision that such a facility should be government-owned to prevent a single contractor exclusive advantages on Air Force contracts for high-thrust missile rocket power plants, and it would eliminate duplication of like facilities by different manufacturers.  The choice of location in 1947 was the Leuhman Ridge east of Rogers Dry Lake on Edwards AFB.   Construction began in November 1949 on what was to become the Experimental Rocket Engine Test Station.&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

===Cold War===

====Flight testing====
[[File:North American X-15A 56-6671.jpg|thumb|left|North American X-15A (AF Ser. No. ''56-6671'') with test pilots, Edwards AFB, California. Number 6671 was extensively damaged during emergency landing at Edwards AFB on 9 November 1962 with John McKay at the controls. Later modified as X-15A-2; now on display at the [[National Museum of the U.S. Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB]], OH.]]
Jurisdiction of Edwards AFB was transferred from Air Materiel Command on 2 April 1951 to the newly created [[Air Research and Development Command]]. Activation of the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]] (AFFTC) followed on 25 June 1951. Units designated and assigned to the Center at the time of activation were the 6510th Air Base Wing for station support units.  The test flying units at Edwards were assigned directly to the AFFTC .&lt;ref name="AFSCHIST"/&gt;

That same year, the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School moved to Edwards from Wright Field, Ohio.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"&gt;Air Force Systems Command, Delivering The Future (1989). Compiled by Lt. Col. Beverly S. Follis, USAFR HQ AFSC/Office of History&lt;/ref&gt;

Its curriculum focused on the traditional field of performance testing and the relatively new field of stability and control, which had suddenly assumed critical importance with the dramatic increases in speed offered by the new turbojets. As the decade opened, the first-generation X-1 reached {{Convert|1.45|Mach|}} and a {{Convert|71902|feet|mi km}} altitude, representing the edge of the envelope. The D-558-II Douglas Skyrocket soon surpassed these marks. In 1951, Douglas test pilot Bill Bridgeman flew the Skyrocket to a top speed of {{Convert|1.88|Mach|}} and a peak altitude of {{Convert|74,494|feet|mi km}}. Then, in 1953, Marine Corps test pilot, Lieutenant Colonel [[Marion Carl]], flew the same plane to an altitude of {{Convert|83235|feet|mi km}}.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

On 20 November 1951, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics' [[Albert Scott Crossfield|Scott Crossfield]] became the first man to reach Mach 2 as he piloted the Skyrocket to a speed of {{Convert|2.005|Mach|}}. Less than a month later, Major [[Chuck Yeager]] topped this record as he piloted the second-generation Bell X-1A to a top speed of {{Convert|2.44|Mach|}} and, just nine months later, Major Arthur "Kit" Murray flew the same airplane to a new altitude record of {{Convert|90440|feet|mi km}}.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

These records stood for less than three years. In September 1956, Captain Iven Kincheloe became the first man to soar above {{Convert|100000|feet|mi km}}, as he piloted the [[Bell X-2]] to a then-remarkable altitude of {{Convert|126200|feet|mi km}}. Flying the same airplane just weeks later on 27 September, Captain Mel Apt became the first to exceed {{Convert|3|Mach|}}, accelerating to a speed of {{Convert|3.2|Mach|}}. His moment of glory was tragically brief, however. Just seconds after attaining top speed, the X-2 tumbled violently out of control and Apt was never able to recover.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

With the loss of the X-2, the search for many of the answers to the riddles of high-Mach flight had to be postponed until the arrival of the most ambitious of the rocket planes—the [[North American X-15]].&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

[[File:McDonnell Douglas F-15A-1-MC Eagle 71-0250.jpg|thumb|McDonnell Douglas F-15A-1-MC Eagle (AF Ser. No. ''71-0280'') (also known as YF-15A, first F-15 manufactured) preparing to make its historic first flight on 27 July 1972 at Edwards AFB, CA with the 6512th Test Squadron. This a/c was later used for exploring the F-15's flight envelope, handling qualities and external stores carriage capabilities.]]

Meanwhile, the turbojet revolution had reached a high plateau at Edwards.  By the time the base was officially designated the U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center in June 1951, more than 40 different types of aircraft had first taken flight at the base and the nation's first generation of jet-powered combat airplanes had already completed development.  One of them, the North American [[F-86 Sabre]], was dominating the skies over Korea.&lt;ref name="EDHIST"&gt;[http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080117-028.pdf   The U.S. Air Force Flight Test Center Forging Aerospace Power for America Air Force Flight Test Center History Office] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012075524/http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080117-028.pdf |date=12 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The promise of the turbojet revolution and the  supersonic breakthrough were realized in the 1950s, as the Center tested and developed the first generation of true supersonic fighters—the famed "Century Series" [[F-100 Super Sabre]], [[F-101 Voodoo]], [[F-102 Delta Dagger]], [[F-104 Starfighter]], [[F-105 Thunderchief]] and [[F-106 Delta Dart]], and, in the process, defined the basic speed and altitude envelopes for fighter aircraft that still prevail to this day.  The Center also played a pivotal role in the development of systems that would provide the United States with true intercontinental power projection capabilities as it tested aircraft such as the [[B-52 Stratofortress]], [[C-133 Cargomaster]] and [[KC-135 Stratotanker]], as well as the [[YC-130 Hercules]] which served as the basis for a classic series of tactical transports that would continue in frontline service until well into the 21st century. It also supported the development of the extremely high-altitude and long-range [[Lockheed U-2]] and the dazzling ultra-performance capabilities of the [[B-58 Hustler]], the world's first Mach 2 bomber.&lt;ref name="EDHIST"/&gt;

Throughout the 1950s, American airplanes regularly broke absolute speed and altitude records at Edwards, but nothing compared to the arrival of the [[North American X-15]] in 1961. The program got underway in earnest in 1961 when Maj. Robert M. "Bob" White became the first man to exceed Mach 4, as he accelerated to {{Convert|4.43|Mach|}} on 7 March. He claimed Mach 5 just three months later when he pegged a speed of {{Convert|5.27|Mach|}} on 23 June and then, during the X-15's first full-powered flight on 9 November, he exceeded Mach 6, as he flew to a speed of {{Convert|6.04|Mach|}}. Major White also became the first man to fly an airplane in space when he climbed to {{Convert|314750|feet|mi km}} on 17 July 1962. NASA's Joe Walker flew the airplane to its peak altitude of {{Convert|354200|feet|mi km}} on 22 August 1963 and Maj William J. "Pete" Knight reached {{Convert|6.72|Mach|}} in the modified X-15A-2 on 3 October 1967, a speed that remains the highest ever attained in an airplane.&lt;ref name="EDHIST"/&gt;

In addition to the X-15 Program, AFFTC and NASA also teamed up to explore a new concept called "lifting reentry" with a series of wingless lifting body aircraft.  These rocket powered-vehicles — the M2-F2, M2-F3, HL-10, X-24A and X-24B — paved the way for the Space Shuttle and future spaceplane designs when they demonstrated that they could make precision landings after high-speed gliding descents from high altitude.&lt;ref name="EDHIST"/&gt;

The major aircraft systems that were tested and developed during the 1960s, the [[T-38 Talon]], [[B-52H Stratofortress]], [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4 and RF-4 Phantom II]], the [[F-111]] and FB-111, [[C-141 Starlifter]] and [[C-5 Galaxy]], all became mainstays in the USAF operational inventory. Another aircraft gained world fame in the late 1960s at Edwards: the [[Lockheed YF-12A]], a precursor to the [[SR-71 Blackbird]], shattered nine records in one day of testing at Edwards. The SR-71's full capabilities remain classified, but the records set on 1 May 1965 included a sustained speed of {{convert|2070|mph}} and an altitude of {{convert|80257|ft|mi km|0}}.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

[[File:YF-16 and YF-17 in flight 2.jpg|thumb|left|YF-16 and YF-17 in flight during their competitive fly-off, 1974. Over 4,000 production F-16s were built after the competition. The YF-17 was the basis for the highly successful United States Navy F/A-18 Hornet.]]

New aircraft types arrived in the 1970s: the F-15 Eagle with its advanced engine and fire-control system; the single-engine F-16 Fighting Falcon with its revolutionary "fly-by-wire" flight control system; and the B-1 Lancer with its multitude of highly sophisticated offensive and defensive systems. These planes more than bore out the prophecy concerning the ever-increasing importance of systems testing and integration. Moreover, another major new element of complexity was soon introduced into the flight test process.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

At a remote location in 1978 and 1979, an AFFTC test pilot and a pair of flight test engineers were engaged in proof-of-concept testing with Lockheed's "low-observable" technology demonstrator, dubbed "Have Blue." The successful conduct of these tests led immediately to the development of a new subsonic attack aircraft that was designated the F-117A Nighthawk.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

The capabilities of existing aircraft such as the F-15 and F-16 have been continually refined and expanded, even as totally new aircraft and systems incorporating radical new technologies are developed for future operational use. The dual-role F-15E, for example, was developed in the 1980s and went on to demonstrate truly remarkable combat effectiveness in the Persian Gulf conflict of the early 90s. The Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night, or LANTIRN, system revolutionized air-to-ground combat operations during the same conflict by denying opposing forces the once comforting sanctuary of night.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

The late 1980s also witnessed the arrival of the first giant flying wing to soar over the base in nearly 40 years. The thin silhouette, compound curves and other low-observable characteristics of the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]] bomber represented third-generation stealth technology, following the SR-71 and F-117.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

The 1980s also saw Edwards host a demonstration of America's space warfare capabilities when a highly modified [[F-15 Eagle]] launched an [[ASM-135 ASAT|ASM-135]] anti-satellite missile at the dead [[P78-1]] (or Solwind) satellite and destroyed it. In 1986, [[Dick Rutan]] and [[Jeana Yeager]] launched from Edwards to set a new aviation record by piloting the first non-stop, around-the-world flight on a single tank of fuel in the [[Rutan Voyager]].&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AFSC"/&gt;

====Ground research====
[[File:Rocket sled track.jpg|thumb|left|Lt. Col. [[John Stapp]] rides the [[rocket sled]] ''Gee Whiz''.]]
Extensive aviation research was also conducted on the ground at Edwards. Two rocket sled tracks pioneered important developments and research for the Air Force. The first {{convert|2000|ft|adj=on}} track was built by [[Northrop Corporation|Northrop]] in 1944 near what is currently the North Base. Originally intended to help develop a [[V-1 (flying bomb)|V-1]] flying-bomb-style weapon that never left the drawing board, the track found use after the war as a test area for [[V-2 rocket]]s captured from [[Nazi Germany]] in [[Operation Paperclip]]. Later, Lt. Col. [[John Stapp]] appropriated the track for his [[MX981]] project and installed what was believed to be one of the most powerful mechanical braking systems ever constructed. His deceleration tests led the press to nickname him the "fastest man on earth" and the "bravest man in the Air Force".&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

The results from the first track prompted the Air Force to build a second in 1948. Located just south of Rogers Lake, the {{convert|10000|ft|mi km|adj=on}} track was capable of supersonic speeds. Its first project was the development of the [[SM-62 Snark]] [[cruise missile]]. This track was so successful that an extension was constructed, and on 13 May 1959, the full {{convert|20000|ft|mi km|adj=on}} track was opened. After the [[United States Navy|Navy]] had conducted research on the [[UGM-27 Polaris]] [[ballistic missile]], the track was used to develop [[ejection seat]]s that could be used at supersonic speeds. Though this program was a success, a budgetary review concluded that the track was too expensive to maintain and the track was decommissioned on 24 May 1963. Before it was closed, a trial run set a world speed record of {{Convert|3.3|Mach|}} before the test car broke up. After it closed, the rails were pulled up to help straighten Lancaster Boulevard.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

After President [[Richard M. Nixon]] announced the [[Space Shuttle program]] on January 5, 1972, Edwards was chosen for [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] testing. The prototype {{OV|101}} was carried to altitude by the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]] (SCA) and released. In all, 13 test flights were conducted with the Enterprise and the SCA to determine their flight characteristics and handling.

After Space Shuttle [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] became the first shuttle launched into orbit on April 12, 1981, it returned to Edwards for landing. The airbase's immense lakebeds and its proximity to [[Plant 42]], where the shuttle was serviced before relaunch, were important factors in its selection and it continued to serve as the primary landing area for the space shuttle until 1991. After that time, [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in [[Florida]] was favored. This saved the considerable cost of transporting the shuttle from California back to Florida, but Edwards AFB and [[White Sands Space Harbor]] continued to serve as backups for the duration of the shuttle program. Shuttles landed at Edwards as recently as August 9, 2005 ([[STS-114]]), June 22, 2007 ([[STS-117]]), November 30, 2008 ([[STS-126]]),  May 24, 2009 ([[STS-125]]), and September 11, 2009 ([[STS-128]]) due to rain and ceiling events at the KSC [[Shuttle Landing Facility]]. STS-126 was the only mission to land on temporary runway 04 at Edwards, as the refurbished main runway was operational from [[STS-119]] through to the retirement of the shuttles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2008/11/endeavour-lands-at-edwards-to-conclude-sts-126/|title=Endeavour lands at Edwards to conclude STS-126|accessdate=30 November 2008|publisher=NASASpaceflight.com|date=30 November 2008|author=Chris Bergin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Into the 1990s===
[[File:YF-22 and YF-23.jpg|thumb|left|Prototype YF-22 and YF-23 fighters, 1991]]
The end of the Cold War was marked by the arrival of the YF-22A and the YF-23A. The two prototype fighters were the first airplanes to blend stealth with agility and high-speed, supersonic cruise capability. The YF-22A was selected to become the Air Force's new advanced tactical fighter after a brief demonstration and validation risk reduction flight test program. Now named the Raptor, the F-22A continues to undergo test and evaluation at Edwards.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

A new group of research projects came to Edwards in the 1990s. [[Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk|Global Hawk]], an unmanned aerial vehicle that has been used extensively in Afghanistan and Iraq, made its first flight at Edwards in February 1998. The X-24, X-33, X-34, X-36 and X-38, a series of new lifting bodies, technology demonstrators and half-scale models were tested here by NASA during the decade.&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;

The new millennium brought new projects with worldwide impact. The X-35A and X-32A, competing models for the Joint Strike Fighter program, made their first flights in September and October 2000. The X-35A won the competition in 2001 and will eventually be built in various versions for America's flying armed services and for foreign air forces as well. Also new are the [[RQ-4 Global Hawk]], [[Boeing YAL-1|YAL-1 Airborne Laser]], [[B-52 Stratofortress#Fuel research platform|the B-52 synthetic fuel program]], the [[C-17 Globemaster III]], and many prototype [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs).&lt;ref name="HIST"/&gt;
[[File:Northrop Grumman Block 20 RQ-4B Global Hawk 05-2023.jpg|thumb|452d Flight Test Squadron Northrop Grumman Block 20 RQ-4B Global Hawk (''05-2023'') being serviced at Edwards AFB.]]                                                                                                        
Edwards is among the few U.S. military bases to have gained jobs since the Cold War.  Under the DoD's [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process, several smaller bases have been decommissioned, and their facilities and responsibilities have been sent to Edwards, [[China Lake]], and other large bases.

During 2012, the 95th Air Base Wing, the former base support unit at Edwards was inactivated and consolidated into the 412th Test Wing as part of the Air Force Flight Test Center transitioning into the Air Force Test Center. The five-Center consolidation not only better integrates the workforce, but saves taxpayers approximately $109 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwards.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123308673 Col.

==Geography==
{{original research section|date=October 2013}}
[[File:Rogers Dry Lake.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Rogers Dry Lake|Rogers Lake]] is not always dry. During the brief rainy season in the [[Mojave Desert]], water fills the lake bed. The [[compass rose]] can be seen on the left.]]

The largest features of the {{convert|470|sqmi}} that make up Edwards AFB are the [[Rogers Dry Lake|Rogers Lake]] and [[Rosamond Lake]] dry lakes. These have served as emergency and scheduled landing sites for many aerospace projects including the [[Bell X-1]], [[Lockheed U-2]], [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird]], and the [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]]. The lakebeds have black lines painted on them to mark seven official "runways". Also painted on the dry lake beds near Dryden is the world's largest [[compass rose]]: {{convert|2000|ft|m|adj=on}} radius, {{Convert|4000|feet|mi km|2}} in diameter. The Edwards AFB compass rose's [[magnetic declination]] to true north is measured by Google Earth's distance/direction measurement tool as inclined to [[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]] with a 15.3 degrees east variance of [[true north]], as opposed to the current variance of 12.4 degrees east (2014.) This is consistent with a calculated magnetic variance at this location in the early 1960s. The larger lake bed, Rogers, encompasses {{convert|44|sqmi}} of desert. Because of Rogers' history in the space program, it was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].
[[File:Jfader dryden.jpg|thumb|The world's largest compass rose is painted on the lake bed beside NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center.]]

The Rosamond dry lake bed encompasses {{convert|21|sqmi}} and is also used for emergency landings and other flight research roles. By August, the lake bed is dry and rough from the weather and from high performance aircraft performing landings. Both lake beds are some of the lowest points in the [[Antelope Valley]] and they can collect large amounts of [[precipitation]]. Desert winds whip this seasonal water around on the lake beds and the process polishes them, yielding a new, extremely flat surface;{{sfn|Collins|2009|pp=4-5}} the Rosamond lake bed was measured to have an altitude deviation of {{convert|18|in}} over a {{convert|30000|ft|adj=on}} length; that's about {{convert|1|mm}} altitude deviation over every {{convert|20|m}} of length.

The census-designated place encompasses an area of {{convert|44.38|sqkm|sqmi|1}} of which {{convert|0.173|ha|acre}} is water.

===Environmental concerns===
There are several protected and threatened species living in Edwards, the most notable being the [[desert tortoise]] (''Gopherus agassizii''). It is illegal to touch, harass or otherwise harm a desert tortoise. Another notable species is ''[[Yucca brevifolia]]'': the taller members of this species are called Joshua trees.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13109">In [[forensic entomology]], '''entomotoxicology''' is the analysis of toxins in [[arthropod]]s (mainly [[flies]] and [[beetles]]) that feed on [[carrion]].  Using arthropods in a corpse or at a crime scene, investigators can determine whether toxins were present in a body at the time of death. This technique is a major advance in forensics; previously, such determinations were impossible in the case of severely decomposed bodies devoid of intoxicated tissue and bodily fluids. Ongoing research into the effects of toxins on arthropod development has also allowed better estimations of [[postmortem intervals]].

==Effects of toxins on arthropods==

Drugs can have a variety of effects on development rates of arthropods. [[Morphine]], [[heroin]], [[cocaine]], and [[methamphetamine]] are commonly involved in cases where forensic entomology is used. The stages of growth for insects provides a basis for determining a cause in altered cycles in a specific species. An altered stage in development can often indicate toxins in the [[carrion]] on which the insects are feeding. Beetles (Order: [[Coleoptera]]) and beetle feces are often used in entomotoxicology, but the presence of toxins is often the result of the beetles’ feeding on fly larvae that have been feeding on the carrion containing toxic substances. Flies (Order: [[Diptera]]) are the most commonly used insect in entomotoxicology.&lt;ref name=gagliano&gt; Gagliano-Candela, R. and Aventaggiato, L. “The detection of toxic substances in entomological specimens.” ''International Journal of Legal Medicine'' 114 (2001): 197-203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the study of ''Sarcophaga (Curranea) tibialis'' larvae, [[barbiturates]] were found to increase the length of the larval stage of the fly, which will ultimately cause an increase in the time it takes to reach the stage of [[pupation]].&lt;ref name=musvasva&gt;Musvasva, E. and others. “Preliminary observations of the effects of hydrocortisone and sodium methohexital on development of Sarcophaga (Curranea) tibialis Macquart (Diptera: [[Sarcophagidae]]), and implications for estimating post mortem interval.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 37-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Morphine and heroin were both believed to slow down the rate of fly development.&lt;ref name=introna&gt;Introna, Francesco and others. ”Entomotoxicology.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 42-47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho, Lucila M.L.; Linhares, Arício X.; and Trigo, José Roberto. “Determination of drug levels and effect of diazepam on the growth of necrophagous flies of forensic importance in southeastern Brazil.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 140-144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, closer examination of the effects of heroin on fly development has shown that it actually speeds up larval growth and then decreases the development rate of the pupal stage. This actually increases the overall timing of development from egg to adult. Research of ''[[Lucilia sericata]]'' (Diptera: [[Calliphoridae]]), reared on various concentrations of morphine injected meat, found higher concentrations of morphine in shed pupal casings than in adults.&lt;ref&gt; Bourel, Benoit and others. “Morphine extraction in necrophagous insects remains for determining ante-mortem opiate intoxication.” ''Forensic Science International'' 120 (2001): 127-131.&lt;/ref&gt; Cocaine and methamphetamine also accelerate the rate of fly development.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

Some effects depend on the concentration of the toxin while others simply depend on its presence. For example, cocaine (at the lethal dose) causes larvae to “develop more rapidly 36 (to 76) hours after hatching”.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt; The amount of growth depends on the concentration of cocaine in the area being fed upon.  The amount of methamphetamine, on the other hand, affects the rate of pupal development. A lethal dose of methamphetamine increases larval development through approximately the first two days and afterwards the rate drops if exposure remains at the median lethal dosage. The presence of methamphetamine was also found to cause a decrease in the maximum length of the larvae.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

Along with changes in development rates, extended periods of insect feeding refrain and variation in the size of the insect during any stage of development, can also indicate the presence of toxic substances in the insect’s food source.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

==Examples of use==

Since J.C. Beyer and his partners first demonstrated the ability of toxins to be recovered from [[maggots]] feeding on human remains in 1980, the use of entomotoxicology in investigations has made an emergence into the field of forensic entomology.&lt;ref name=pounder&gt;Pounder, Derrick J. “Forensic entomo-toxicology.” ''Journal of the Forensic Science Society'' 31 (1991): 469-472.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of one such case involved the discovery of a 22-year-old female with a history of suicide attempts found 14 days after her death.  Due to the body’s advanced stage of [[decomposition]], no organ or tissue samples were viable to screen for toxins. Through [[gas chromatography]] (GC) and [[thin-layer chromatography]] (TLC) analysis of ''Cochliomyia macellaria'' (Diptera: Calliphoridae) larvae found feeding on the woman’s body, [[phenobarbital]] was detected and perceived to have been in the woman’s system upon death.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

===Drug abuse detected===
In France, Pascal Kintz and his colleagues were able to demonstrate the use of entomotoxicology to detect toxins that were not discovered during the analysis of body tissues and fluids of a body found roughly two months after death.  A liquid chromatography analysis on organ tissue and Calliphoridae larvae found at the scene revealed the existence of five prescription medications.  [[Triazolam]], however, was only detected in the analysis of maggots and not in organ tissue samples.  Comparative research showed increased sensitivity of toxicological analysis of Diptera samples over decomposed body tissues.  A similar case involved the discovery of the remains of a 29-year-old known to abuse drugs, last seen alive five months prior.  Through the use of GC and GC-MS techniques, Nolte and his partners discovered the presence of cocaine in decomposed muscle tissue and in maggots found on the body.  However, due to the severity of decomposition of the muscle tissue, more suitable drug samples (devoid of decomposition byproducts) were reared from the maggots.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

===Aid determination of origin===
Pekka Nuorteva presented the case of a young woman found severely decomposed in Inkoo, Finland.  Diptera larvae recovered from the body were reared to adulthood and found to contain low levels of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], indicating that the woman came from an area of comparatively low mercury pollution.  This assumption was proven correct once the woman was identified and found to have been a student in Turku, Finland.  This case demonstrated the ability of toxicological analysis to help determine origin.&lt;ref name=goff-lord&gt; Goff, M. Lee and Lord, Wayne D. “Entomotoxicology- A New Area for Forensic Investigation.” ''The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology'' 15 (1994): 51-57.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case applied Nuorteva’s research involving mercury and its effect on maggots.  Through experimentation, it was determined that maggots (fed on [[fish]] containing mercury) possessed levels of mercury in their tissue of even greater concentration than in the tissue of the fish.  Nuorteva also discovered that the presence of mercury in the maggots systems hindered their ability to enter into the pupal stage.&lt;ref name=goff&gt;Goff, M. Lee. A Fly for the Prosecution. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxin confounding of postmortem interval estimate===
Through the analysis of specific cases, it was revealed that toxins present in a person’s body upon death can confound [[postmortem interval]] estimations.  An example of such a case, reported by Gunatilake and Goff, concerned the discovery of a 58-year-old male with a history of attempted suicides found dead in a crawl space in Honolulu, Hawaii last seen eight days prior.  Two species of Diptera (Calliphoridae), ''Chrysomya megacephala'' and ''[[Chrysomya rufifacies]]'', found on the corpse and tissue samples from the body revealed [[malathion]].  Investigators found it abnormal that, given the conditions, there were only two fly species found on the body and that these species revealed a postmortem interval of five days.  Thus it was determined that the presence of the [[organophosphate]] malathion in the man’s system delayed oviposition for a few days.&lt;ref name=goff-lord/&gt;

Paul Catts analyzed a case in Spokane, Washington where maggots rendered differing postmortem estimations.  A 20-year-old female victim was found stabbed to death and laying in an open environment surrounded by trees.  Most of the oldest maggots found on the body were approximately 6–7 mm long which suggested that they were roughly seven days old.  There was, however, a very strange exception which was the retrieval of a 17.7 mm maggot which suggested an age of 3 weeks.  After ruling out the possibility that the maggot had traveled onto the corpse from carrion nearby, it was assumed that there was no conceivable way a 3 week old maggot could have been present on the corpse.  Later investigations revealed that the woman had snorted cocaine shortly before her death and that the 17.7 mm maggot must have feed in the woman’s nasal cavity.  Research revealed that maggot development can be sped up by the ingestion of cocaine.&lt;ref&gt; Catts, E. Paul, and Neal H. Haskell. Entomology and Death: A Procedural Guide. Clemson: Joyce’s Print Shop, Inc., 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Use of shed casings and insect feces===
Not only are tissues from maggots used to detect toxins, shed casings and insect feces have also been used to detect and identify toxins present in corpses upon death.  An instance of this finding was demonstrated by Edward McDonough, a [[medical examiner]] in Connecticut.  A mummified corpse of a middle-aged woman was found inside of her home.  Prescription medicine bottles were found with labels identifying the following drugs: [[ampicillin]], [[Ceclor]], doxycyline, [[erythromycin]], [[Elavil]], [[Lomotil]], [[pentazocine]], and [[Tylenol 3]].   McDonough performed toxicological analyses on stomach contents and dried sections of brain and found lethal levels of [[amitriptyline]] and [[nortriptyline]].  Insect feces, shed pupal cases of ''[[Megaselia scalaris]]'' (Diptera: [[Phoridae]]), and shed larval skins of ''Dermestes maculates'' (Coleoptera: [[Dermestidae]]) were gathered from the corpse at the scene.  McDonough sent these to an [[FBI]] lab which broke down the complex structures of the samples using strong acids and bases and freed the toxins for analysis.  The cast pupal cases and larval skins were also found to contain amitriptyline and nortriptyline.  Larger concentrations were discovered in the pupal cases because phorid flies prefer to feed on softer tissues.  The hide beetle larval skins revealed lower concentrations of the drugs because these beetles prefer to feed on dry, mummified bodies.  The use of pupal cases and larval skins allows for investigators to detect toxins in a body years after [[death]].&lt;ref name=goff/&gt;

==Limitations==

Further research should be conducted in order to fill the gaps in entomotoxicology. Such areas as [[bioaccumulation]], insect [[metabolism]] of drugs, and quantitative analyses of insect evidence have only begun to be researched. Because it is a relatively new branch of forensic entomology, entomotoxicology has its limitations. According to Pounder’s research, there is no correlation between the drug concentration in tissue and the larvae feeding on that tissue.&lt;ref name=pounder/&gt; Entomological specimens make for excellent qualitative toxicological specimens. There is, however, a lack of research in the way of developing an assessment that can quantify the concentration of a drug in tissue using entomological evidence. One reason for this is that a drug can only be detected in larvae when the rate of absorption exceeds the rate of elimination.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Z.; Hubbard, S.; Pounder, D.J. “Drug analysis in fly larvae.” ''The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology'' 14 (1993): 118-120.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated this theory using ''[[Calliphora vicina]]'' larvae reared on human skeletal muscle obtained from cases of [[co-proxamol]] and [[amitriptyline]] overdose. Samples of pupae and third [[instar]] larvae no longer contained concentrations of the drugs, suggesting that drugs do not bioaccumulate over the entire life-cycle of larvae. This leads entomologists to theorize that toxins are eliminated from the larvae’s system over time if they are not receiving a constant supply of the toxin.&lt;ref name=introna/&gt;

'''Environmental ethics''' is the part of [[environmental philosophy]] which considers extending the traditional boundaries of ethics from solely including humans to including the non-human world. It exerts influence on a large range of disciplines including [[environmental law]], [[environmental sociology]], [[ecotheology]], [[ecological economics]], [[ecology]] and [[Integrated geography|environmental geography]].

There are many ethical decisions that human beings make with respect to the environment. For example:

*Should humans continue to [[clearcutting|clear cut]] forests for the sake of human consumption?
*Why should humans continue to propagate its species, and life itself? &lt;ref name = "Bioethics"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title =  Life-centered ethics, and the human future in space | journal = Bioethics | volume = 23 | pages = 433–440 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x | pmid=19077128 | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic field of environmental ethics grew up in response to the work of scientists such as [[Rachel Carson]] and events such as the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970, when environmentalists started urging philosophers to consider the philosophical aspects of environmental problems. Two papers published in ''Science'' had a crucial impact: [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.|Lynn White]]'s "The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis" (March 1967)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Science| title=The Historical Roots of our Ecologic Crisis| first=Lynn| last=White|date=March 1967| doi =  10.1126/science.155.3767.1203|volume=155|issue=3767|pages=1203–1207|pmid=17847526 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Garrett Hardin]]'s "The Tragedy of the Commons" (December 1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also influential was Garett Hardin's later essay called "Exploring New Ethics for Survival", as well as an essay by [[Aldo Leopold]] in his ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'', called "The Land Ethic," in which Leopold explicitly claimed that the roots of the ecological crisis were philosophical (1949).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sand County Almanac| first=Aldo| last=Leopold| year=1949| chapter=The Land Ethic|isbn=1-59726-045-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first international academic journals in this field emerged from North America in the late 1970s and early 1980s – the US-based journal ''[[Environmental Ethics (journal)|Environmental Ethics]]'' in 1979 and the Canadian-based journal ''[[The Trumpeter: Journal of Ecosophy]]'' in 1983. The first British based journal of this kind, ''[[Environmental Values]]'', was launched in 1992.

== Marshall's categories ==
Some scholars have tried to categorise the various ways the natural environment is valued. [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]] and [[Michael A. Smith|Michael Smith]] are two examples of this, as cited by [[Peter Vardy (theologian)|Peter Vardy]] in "The Puzzle of Ethics".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Vardy, Paul Grosch: The Puzzle of Ethics. New York: Harper Collins 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marshall, three general ethical approaches have emerged over the last 40 years: Libertarian Extension, the Ecologic Extension and Conservation Ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethics and the Extraterrestrial Environment. In: Journal of Applied Philosophy, Vol. 10, No. 2, 1993, pp. 227-236.| first=Alan| last=Marshall|issn=1468-5930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Libertarian extension ===
Marshall’s Libertarian extension echoes a civil liberty approach (i.e. a commitment to extend equal rights to all members of a community). In environmentalism, though, the community is generally thought to consist of non-humans as well as humans.

Andrew Brennan was an advocate of ecologic humanism (eco-humanism), the argument that all ontological entities, animate and in-animate, can be given ethical worth purely on the basis that they exist. The work of [[Arne Næss]] and his collaborator Sessions also falls under the libertarian extension, although they preferred the term "[[deep ecology]]". Deep ecology is the argument for the intrinsic value or inherent worth of the environment – the view that it is valuable in itself. Their argument, incidentally, falls under both the libertarian extension and the ecologic extension.

[[Peter Singer]]'s work can be categorized under Marshall's 'libertarian extension'. He reasoned that the "expanding circle of moral worth" should be redrawn to include the rights of non-human animals, and to not do so would be guilty of [[speciesism]]. Singer found it difficult to accept the argument from intrinsic worth of a-biotic or "non-sentient" (non-conscious) entities, and concluded in his first edition of "Practical Ethics" that they should not be included in the expanding circle of moral worth.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Singer: Practical Ethics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is essentially then, bio-centric. However, in a later edition of "Practical Ethics" after the work of Næss and Sessions, Singer admits that, although unconvinced by deep ecology, the argument from intrinsic value of non-sentient entities is plausible, but at best problematic. Singer advocated a humanist ethics.

=== Ecologic extension ===
Alan Marshall's category of ecologic extension places emphasis not on
human rights but on the recognition of the fundamental interdependence 
of all biological (and some abiological) entities and their essential 
diversity. Whereas Libertarian Extension can be thought of as flowing 
from a political reflection of the natural world, ecologic extension is 
best thought of as a scientific reflection of the natural world. 
Ecological Extension is roughly the same classification of Smith's 
eco-holism, and it argues for the intrinsic value inherent in collective
ecological entities like ecosystems or the global environment as a 
whole entity. Holmes Rolston, among others, has taken this approach.

This category might include [[James Lovelock]]'s [[Gaia hypothesis]]; the theory that the planet earth alters its geo-physiological structure over time in order to ensure the continuation of an equilibrium of evolving organic and inorganic matter. The planet is characterized as a unified, [[Holism|holistic]] entity with ethical worth of which the human race is of no particular significance in the long run.

=== Conservation ethics ===
Marshall's category of 'conservation ethics' is an extension of use-value into the non-human biological world. It focuses only on the worth of the environment in terms of its utility or usefulness to humans. It contrasts the intrinsic value ideas of 'deep ecology', hence is often referred to as 'shallow ecology', and generally argues for the preservation of the environment on the basis that it has extrinsic value – instrumental to the welfare of human beings. Conservation is therefore a means to an end and purely concerned with mankind and inter-generational considerations. It could be argued that it is this ethic that formed the underlying arguments proposed by Governments at the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto summit]] in 1997 and three agreements reached in Rio in 1992.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

== Humanist theories ==
Peter Singer advocated the preservation of "world heritage sites," unspoilt parts of the world that acquire a "scarcity value" as they diminish over time. Their preservation is a bequest for future generations as they have been inherited from human's ancestors and should be passed down to future generations so they can have the opportunity to decide whether to enjoy unspoilt countryside or an entirely urban landscape. A good example of a world heritage site would be the tropical rainforest, a very specialist ecosystem that has taken centuries to evolve. Clearing the rainforest for farmland often fails due to soil conditions, and once disturbed, can take thousands of years to regenerate.

== Applied theology ==

[[File:One Earth one family - Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action.webm|thumb|thumbtime=05:53|upright=1.2|Pope Francis’s environmental encyclical [[w:Laudato si'|Laudato si']] has been welcomed by many environmental organisations of different faiths  - Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action]]

The Christian world view sees the universe as created by God, and humankind accountable to God for the use of the resources entrusted to humankind. Ultimate values are seen in the light of being valuable to God.  This applies both in breadth of scope -  caring for people (Matthew 25) and environmental issues, e.g. environmental health (Deuteronomy 22.8; 23.12-14) - and dynamic motivation,  the love of Christ controlling (2 Corinthians 5.14f) and dealing with the underlying spiritual disease of sin, which shows itself in selfishness and thoughtlessness. In many countries this relationship of accountability is symbolised at harvest thanksgiving. (B.T. Adeney : Global Ethics in New Dictionary of Christian Ethics and Pastoral Theology 1995 Leicester)

Abrahamic religious scholars have used theology to motivate the public. [[John L. O'Sullivan]], who coined the term [[Manifest destiny]], and other influential people like him used Abrahamic ideologies to encourage action. These religious scholars, columnists and politicians historically have used these ideas and continue to do so to justify the consumptive tendencies of a young America around the time of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In order to solidify the understanding that God had intended for humankind to use earths natural resources, environmental writers and religious scholars alike proclaimed that humans are separate from nature, on a higher order.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Peter. Ecology: Religious or Secular? Heythrop Journal. Jan 1997, Vol. 38 Issue 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Those that may critique this point of view may ask the same question that John Muir asks ironically in a section of his novel ''A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf'', ''why are there so many dangers in the natural world in the form of poisonous plants, animals and natural disasters'', The answer is that those creatures are a result of [[Adam and Eve]]'s sins in the garden of Eden.&lt;ref&gt;Muir, John. From A Thousand-mile Walk to the Gulf. American Earth: Environmental Writing Since Thoreau. Ed. Bill McKibben. N.p.: The Library of America, 2008. 85-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the turn of the 20th century, the application of theology in environmentalism diverged into two schools of thought. The first system of understanding holds religion as the basis of environmental stewardship. The second sees the use of theology as a means to rationalize the unmanaged consumptions of natural resources. [[Lynn Townsend White Jr.|Lynn White]] and Calvin DeWitt represent each side of this dichotomy.

[[John Muir]] personified nature as an inviting place away from the loudness of urban centers. "For Muir and the growing number of Americans who shared his views, Satan's home had become God's Own Temple."&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, ed., Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature, New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995, 69-90;&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Abrahamic religious allusions assisted Muir and the [[Sierra Club]] to create support for some of the first public nature preserves.

Authors like Terry Tempest Williams as well as John Muir build on the idea that "...God can be found wherever you are, especially outside. Family worship was not just relegated to Sunday in a chapel."&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Terry T. Refuge : an unnatural history of family and place. New York: Vintage Books, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; References like these assist the general public to make a connection between paintings done at the [[Hudson River School]], [[Ansel Adams]]' photographs, along with other types of media, and their religion or spirituality. Placing intrinsic value upon nature through theology is a fundamental idea of [[Deep ecology]].

== Anthropocentrism ==
{{main article|Anthropocentrism}}

Anthropocentrism is the position that humans are the most important or critical element in any given situation; that the human race must always be its own primary concern. Detractors of anthropocentrism argue that the Western tradition biases homo sapiens when considering the environmental ethics of a situation and that humans evaluate their environment or other organisms in terms of the utility for them (see [[speciesism]]). Many argue that all environmental studies should include an assessment of the intrinsic value of non-human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. "''Environmental Values.'' ''The Oxford Book of Travel Stories''. Ed. Ian Marsh. Melbourne, Australia: Longman Cheshire, 1991. 12-16.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, based on this very assumption, a philosophical article has explored recently the possibility of humans' willing extinction as a gesture toward other beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.borderlands.net.au/vol7no3_2008/kochiordan_argument.pdf Tarik Kochi &amp; Noam Ordan, "An Argument for the Global Suicide of Humanity". ''Borderlands'', 2008, Vol. 3, 1-21].&lt;/ref&gt; The authors refer to the idea as a [[thought experiment]] that should not be understood as a call for action.

[[Baruch Spinoza]] reasoned that if humans were to look at things objectively, they would discover that everything in the universe has a unique value. Likewise, it is possible that a human-centred or anthropocentric/androcentric ethic is not an accurate depiction of reality, and there is a bigger picture that humans may or may not be able to understand from a human perspective.

[[Peter Vardy (theologian)|Peter Vardy]] distinguished between two types of anthropocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Vardy and Paul Grosch (1999), ..The Puzzle of Ethics.., p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; A strong anthropocentric ethic argues that humans are at the center of reality and it is right for them to be so. Weak anthropocentrism, however, argues that reality can only be interpreted from a human point of view, thus humans have to be at the centre of reality as they see it.

Another point of view has been developed by Bryan Norton, who has become one of the essential actors of environmental ethics by launching environmental pragmatism, now one of its leading trends. Environmental pragmatism refuses to take a stance in disputes between defenders of anthropocentrist and non-anthropocentrist ethics. Instead, Norton distinguishes between ''strong anthropocentrism'' and ''weak-or-extended-anthropocentrism'' and argues that the former  must underestimate the diversity of instrumental values humans may derive from the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.openedition.org/sapiens/88 Afeissa, H. S. (2008). "The Transformative value of Ecological Pragmatism. An Introduction to the Work of Bryan G. Norton". ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''1''' (1).]&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent view relates anthropocentrism to the future of life. [[Biotic ethics]] are based on the human identity as part of gene/protein organic life whose effective purpose is self-propagation. This implies a human purpose to secure and propagate life.&lt;ref name = "Bioethics"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="Seeding Book"/&gt; Humans are central because only they can secure life beyond the duration of the Sun, possibly for trillions of eons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mautner |first = Michael N. | title = Life in the cosmological future: Resources, biomass and populations  | journal = Journal of the British Interplanetary Society | year = 2005 | volume = 58 | pages = 167–180 | url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFCosmologyJBIS2005Paper.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biotic ethics]] values life itself, as embodied in biological structures and processes. Humans are special because they can secure the future of life on cosmological scales. In particular, humans can continue sentient life that enjoys its existence, adding further motivation to propagate life. Humans can secure the future of  life, and this future can give human existence a cosmic purpose.&lt;ref name = "Bioethics" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Seeding Book" /&gt;

== Status of the field ==

Only after 1990 did the field gain institutional recognition at programs such as [[Colorado State University]], the [[University of Montana]], [[Bowling Green State University]], and the [[University of North Texas]]. In 1991, [[Schumacher College]] of [[Dartington]], England, was founded and now provides an MSc in Holistic Science.

These programs began to offer a master's degree with a specialty in environmental ethics/philosophy. Beginning in 2005 the Department of Philosophy and Religion Studies at the [[University of North Texas]] offered a PhD program with a concentration in environmental ethics/philosophy.

In Germany, the [[University of Greifswald]] has recently established an international program in Landscape Ecology &amp; Nature Conservation with a strong focus on environmental ethics. In 2009, the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] and [[Deutsches Museum]] founded the [[Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society]], an international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5244">Fluvio refers to things related to rivers and glacial refers to something that is of ice. '''Fluvio-glacial''' refers to the [[meltwater]] created when a [[glacier]] melts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/fluvio-|title=fluvio- - definition of fluvio- in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/glacial|title=glacial - definition... of glacial in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluvio-glacial processes can occur on the surface and within the glacier. The [[Deposition (geology)|deposits]] that happen within the glacier are revealed after the entire glacier melts or partially retreats. Fluvio-glacial [[landform]]s and [[erosion]]al surfaces include: [[outwash plain]]s, [[kame]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, kame terraces, [[Kettle (landform)|kettle holes]], [[esker]]s, [[varve]]s, and [[proglacial lake]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/A-level/AQA/Year%2012/Cold%20environs/Fluvioglacial/Fluvioglacial%20landforms.htm|title=Fluvioglacial Landforms|last=|first=|date=|website=Coolgeography.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landforms ==

=== Outwash Plain ===
An outwash plain is both an erosional and depositional surface created by meltwater coming from the glacier. These plains are found in front of the glaciers and are typically characterized by small [[Braided river|braided streams]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The streams are usually small and braided because the [[sediment]] size varies and the original stream gets broken up.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since these streams [[meander]] around, the erosion happens laterally (left to right)  instead of vertically (up and down).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These plains are usually found beyond the [[Terminal moraine|end moraine]] deposited by the glacier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Kame and Kame Terrace ===
[[Kame]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are small hills that consist of sediments ranging from sands to gravels.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geomorphology|last=Gutierrez|first=Mateo|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=538–545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intraglacial movement of water carries sediments and deposits them inside cavaties, or holes, in the glacier; once the glacier melts or retreats, the kames is left behind as a deposit. These hills can range in size and be up to 50 m tall and 400 m wide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A kame terrace is a relatively flat surface of sediment that was deposited between the valley surface and the glacier. When kames, kame surfaces, and other fluvio-glacial landforms are combined into one landscape, it is called a kame complex or glacial [[Karst|karst topography]].

=== Kettle Holes ===
[[Kettle (landform)|Kettle holes]] are typically formed when a chunk of ice that came from the glacier is buried under fluvio-glacial sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/higher/geography/physical/lithosphere/revision/7/|title=BBC - Higher Bitesize Geography - Lithosphere : Revision, Page7|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the ice melts, the sediments fall and form a depression that can later be filled with rainwater and form [[Kettle (landform)|kettle lakes]]. Kettle holes can often be found in the outwash plain of a glacier.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Kettle holes can be anywhere from 5 m to 30&amp;nbsp;km wide.

=== Eskers ===
Eskers can be describes as long, curved ridges made up of sands and gravels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Soil_Geomorphology.html?id=H9FSveDbpbsC|title=Soil Geomorphology|last=Gerrard|first=A J|date=|website=Google Books|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These surfaces were created by intraglacial streams carrying and depositing sediments as they flow through the glacier. These landforms can range from 100 m to 500&amp;nbsp;km long and 3 m to 200 m tall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Varves ===
Varves are a depositional feature of a fluvio-glacial movement. They are layers of annual sediment deposits. The sizes of the sediments vary and depend on the volume of the streams, but are usually associated with mud deposits ([[silt]] and [[clay]]).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/varved-deposit|title=varved deposit {{!}} geology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color and amount of the sediment deposited also varies depending upon the season; summer deposits typically have larger volumes of deposition and are characterized as being light, whereas winter deposits are usually the opposite.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Winter deposits are fairly uncommon because the water is frozen into ice again.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Proglacial Lakes ===
[[Proglacial lake]]s form as meltwater trapped behind a glacial feature such as an end moraine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These lakes have an intake of sediment deposited by streams within the glacier and their deposits are recorded within the varves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13532">'''FlyBase''' is an online [[bioinformatics]] [[database]] and the primary repository of genetic and molecular data for the insect family ''[[Drosophilidae]]''. For the most extensively studied species and [[model organism]], ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', a wide range of data are presented in different formats. Information in FlyBase originates from a variety of sources ranging from large-scale genome projects to the primary research literature. These data types include mutant [[phenotypes]], molecular characterization of mutant [[alleles]] and other deviations, cytological maps, [[wild-type]] expression patterns, anatomical images, transgenic constructs and insertions, sequence-level gene models and molecular classification of gene product functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Crosby, Madeline A|displayauthors=etal|title=FlyBase: Genomes by the Dozen|publisher=Oxford Journals|year=2007|doi=10.1093/nar/gkl827|journal=Nucleic Acids Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Query tools allow navigation of FlyBase through DNA or protein sequence, by gene or mutant name, or through terms from the several ontologies used to capture functional, phenotypic, and anatomical data.

FlyBase is one of the organizations contributing to the [[Generic Model Organism Database]] [http://gmod.org/wiki/Main_Page (GMOD)].

==Background==
''Drosophila melanogaster'' has been an experimental organism since the early 1900s, and has since been placed at the forefront of many areas of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Introduction to Drosophila Melanogaster|publisher=BIOLOGY.ARIZONA.EDU|author=Pete Geiger|year=2002|url=http://biology.arizona.edu/sciconn/lessons2/Geiger/intro.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130802033411/http://biology.arizona.edu/sciconn/lessons2/Geiger/intro.htm|archivedate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this field of research spread and became global, researchers working on the same problems needed a way to communicate and monitor progress in the field. This niche was initially filled community newsletters such as the Drosophila Information Service (DIS), which dates back to 1934 when the field was starting to spread from [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]’s lab. Material in these presented regular ‘catalogs’ of mutations bibliographies of the Drosophila literature. As computer infrastructure developed in the 80’s and 90’s, these newsletters gave way and merged with internet mailing lists, and these eventually became online resources and data. In 1992, data on the genetics and genomics of ''D. melanogaster'' and related species were electronically available over the Internet through the funded FlyBase, [http://www.fruitfly.org/ BDGP] (Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project) and EDGP (European Drosophila Genome Project) informatics groups. These groups recognized that most genome project and community data types overlapped. They decided it would be of value to present the scientific community with an integrated view of the data. In October 1992, the National Center for Human Genome Research of the NIH funded the FlyBase project with the objective of designing, building and releasing a database of genetic and molecular information concerning ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. FlyBase also receives support from the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 146418 | pmid=9045212 | volume=25 | title=FlyBase: a Drosophila database.

Information on current researchers, and a partial pedigree of relationships between current researchers, is searchable, based on registration of the participating scientist ([http://flybase.org/static_pages/people/people_query6.html Find a Person]). The site also provides a large database of images illustrating the full genome, and several movies detailing [[embryogenesis]] ([http://flybase.org/static_pages/imagebrowser/imagebrowser10.html ImageBrowser]).

Search Strategies - Gene reports for genes from all twelve sequenced Drosophila genomes are available in FlyBase. There are four main ways this data can be browsed: [http://flybase.org/static_pages/downloads/bulkdata7.html Precomputed Files], [http://flybase.org/blast/ BLAST], [http://flybase.org/cgi-bin/gbrowse/dmel/ Gbrowse], and Gene Report Pages. Gbrowse and precomputed files are for genome-wide analysis, bioinformatics, and comparative genomics. BLAST and gene report pages are for a specific gene, protein, or region across the species.

When looking for cytology there are two main tools available. Use [http://flybase.org/static_pages/cytosearch/cytosearch15.html Cytosearch] when looking for cytologically-mapped genes or deficiencies, that haven’t been molecularly mapped to the sequence. Use Gbrowse when looking for molecularly mapped sequences, insertions, or Affymetrix probes.

There are two main query tools in FlyBase. The first main query tool is called Jump to Gene (J2G). This is found in the top right of the blue navigation bar on every page of FlyBase. This tool is useful when you know exactly what you are looking for and want to go to the report page with that data. The second main query tool is called QuickSearch. This is located on the FlyBase homepage. This tool is most useful when you want to look up something quickly that you may only know a little about. Searching can be performed within D. melanogaster only or within all species. Data other than genes can be searched using the ‘data class’ menu.


==Related Research==
The following provides two examples of research that is related to or uses FlyBase:

*The first is a study of expressed genes from alate [[Toxoptera citricida]], more commonly known as the brown citrus aphid. The brown citrus aphid, is considered the primary vector of [[citrus tristeza virus]], a severe pathogen which causes losses to citrus industries worldwide. The winged form of this aphid can fly long distances with the wind, enabling them to spread the citrus tristeza virus in citrus growing regions. To better understand the biology of the brown citrus aphid and the emergence of genes expressed during wing development, researchers undertook a large-scale 5′ end sequencing project of cDNA clones from winged aphids. Similar large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing projects from other insects have provided a vehicle for answering biological questions relating to development and physiology. Although there is a growing database in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ GenBank] of ESTs from insects, most are from Drosophila melanogaster, with relatively few specifically derived from aphids.The researchers were able to provide a large data set of ESTs from the alate (winged) brown citrus aphid and have begun to analyze this valuable resource. They were able to do this with the help of information on Drosophila melanogaster in FlyBase. Putative sequence identity was determined using BLAST searches. Sequence matches with E-value scores ≤ −10 were considered significant and were categorized according to the Gene Ontology (GO) classification system based on annotation of the 5 ‘best hit’ matches in BLASTX searches. All D. melanogaster matches were cataloged using FlyBase. Nearly all of these ‘best hit’ matches were characterized with respect to the functionally annotated genes in D. melanogaster using FlyBase. Genetic information is crucial to advancing the understanding of aphid biology, and will play a major role in the development of future non-chemical, gene-based control strategies against these insect pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 524662 | pmid=15841239 | volume=3 | title=Aphid biology: expressed genes from alate Toxoptera citricida, the brown citrus aphid | year=2003 | journal=J.

* Enhancing Drosophila Gene Ontology Annotation: What gene products do and where they do it are important questions for biologists. The Gene Ontology project was established 13 years ago in order to summarize this data consistently across different databases by using a common set of defined vocabulary terms. They also encode relationships between terms. The Gene Ontology Project is a major bioinformatics initiative with the aim of standardizing the representation of gene and gene product attributes across species and databases. The project also provides gene product annotation data from GO consortium members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gene Ontology|access-date=31 May 2017|url=http://geneontology.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; FlyBase was one of the three founding members of the Gene Ontology Consortium. GO annotation comprises at least three components: a GO term that describes molecular function, biological role or subcellular location; an ‘evidence code’ that describes the type of analysis used to support the GO term; and an attribution to a specific reference. GO annotation is useful for both small-scale and large-scale analyses. It can provide a first indication of the nature of a gene product and, in conjunction with evidence codes, point directly to papers with pertinent experimental data. The current priorities for annotation are: homologs of human disease genes, genes that are highly conserved across species, genes involved in biochemical/signaling pathways, and topical genes shown to be of significant interest in recent publications. FlyBase has been contributing GO annotations to the project since it started in August 2006. GO annotations appear on the Gene Report page in FlyBase. GO data are searchable in FlyBase using both TermLink and QueryBuilder. The GO is dynamic and can change on a daily basis, for example the addition of new terms. To keep up, FlyBase loads a new version of the GO every one or two releases of FlyBase. The GO annotation set is submitted to the GOC at the same time as a new version of FlyBase is released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tweedie, Susan|displayauthors=etal|title=FlyBase: Enhancing Drosophila Gene Ontology Annotations|publisher=Oxford Journals |journal=Nucleic Acids Research|doi=10.1093/nar/gkn788|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''frailty index (FI)''' is used to measure the health status of older individuals - as a proxy measure of [[Ageing|aging]] and vulnerability to poor outcomes. This measure was developed by Dr. Kenneth Rockwood and Dr. Arnold Mitnitski at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.

It is defined as the proportion of deficits present in an individual out of the total number of age-related health variables considered. A frailty index can be created in most secondary data sources related to health by utilizing health deficits that are routinely collected in health assessments. These deficits include [[diseases]], signs, symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, cognitive impairments, and disabilities in activities of daily living.&lt;ref name="MyUser_Biomedcentral.com_August_20_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2318/14/25 |title=BMC Geriatrics |newspaper=Biomedcentral.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Frailty Index (FI) =  (number  of health deficits present) ÷ (number of health deficits measured)''

For example, a person with 20 of 40 deficits collected has an FI score of 20/40 = 0.5; whilst for someone with 10 deficits, the FI score is 10/40 = 0.25. The FI takes advantage of the high redundancy in the human organism. This is why it is replicable across different databases even when different items and different numbers of items are used. The standard procedure for creating a frailty index are found in an open-access publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Searle|first=Samuel D|last2=Mitnitski|first2=Arnold|last3=Gahbauer|first3=Evelyne A|last4=Gill|first4=Thomas M|last5=Rockwood|first5=Kenneth|date=2008-09-30|title=A standard procedure for creating a frailty index|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2318/8/24|journal=BMC Geriatrics|language=En|volume=8|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1471-2318-8-24|pmc=2573877|pmid=18826625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several frailty indices, including a clinical deficits frailty index (FI-CD) and a biomarker-based frailty index (FI-B).&lt;ref name="MyUser2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/13/161 |title=BMC Medicine |newspaper=Biomedcentral.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= August 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3891">[[File:Hamburger Druckschrift ab 2011.jpg|thumb|Hamburg's block letters]]

'''Grundschrift''' (''base [[font]]'', literally ''ground script'') is a simplified form of [[handwriting]] adopted by [[Hamburg]] schools, and it is currently endorsed by the German National Primary Schoolteachers' Union.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian - [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/29/germany-teachers-handwriting-schools-schreibschrift German teachers campaign to simplify handwriting in schools]&lt;/ref&gt;

If nationally adopted, it would replace the three different German [[cursive]]s currently being taught in schools: the [[:de:Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift]] (introduced in 1953), the [[:de:Schulausgangsschrift|Schulausgangsschrift]] (1968), and the [[:de:Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift]] (1969), providing a standardized system of handwriting in German school systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grundschrift-schreibschrift.de Grundschrift - Schreibschrift: Verlust oder Gewinn?]&lt;/ref&gt;

Grundschrift letters are written separately as [[block letters]] as opposed to cursive script, in which letters are conjoined together in a flowing motion.

== Reception ==
One of the most important critics of the Grundschrift is Ute Andresen. The former president of the German Society for Reading and Writing (1999 to 2002) argues that "children can not teach themselves to write."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/reform-der-lehrplaene-die-schreibschrift-stirbt-aus-12932933.html - Schreibschrift stirbt aus]&lt;/ref&gt;  The introduction of the basic inscription would mean abolishing cursive handwriting. This is "putting a cultural technique at risk, the ability to write a common readable font ". Andresen contradicts in the [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] interview the statement of the Grundschulverband that the Grundschrift is a connected spelling. "That's wrong. The basic inscription is a modular font, which means the letters are juxtaposed."&lt;ref&gt;[https://handschriftlich.wordpress.com/2014/05/15/kinder-konnen-sich-das-schreiben-nicht-selbst-beibringen/ - Kinder können sich das Schreiben nicht selbst beibringen]&lt;/ref&gt; Andresen is et al. supported by the writer Cornelia Funke. "To master a non-cursive handwriting does not suffice as a script, in my opinion. It does not flow like cursive and is therefore much slower. A flowing script, on the other hand, promotes the flow of thought - and at the same time is so individual that one is completely at one's own."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/cornelia-funke-die-handschrift-soll-gedanken-fliegen-lassen-12933060.html - Die Handschrift soll Gedanken fliegen lassen]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles for the taz, Andresen already pointed out that learning a bound script is a fundamental learning process for every child.  Failing to learn a script increases the risk of bad education. In this way, it occupies the position of Wilhelm Topsch against the {{ill|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|de|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}}. The Oldenburger education scientist has proven in 1996 that there were no other scientific reports for the introduction of these in the 1970s than those of their inventor Heinrich Grünewald.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/bildung/artikel/1/zurueck-zur-guten-handschrift/ - Zurück zur guten Handschrift]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/zukunft/bildung/artikel/1/gutachter-lobbyisten-und-autoren/ - Gutachter, Lobbyisten und Autoren]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Topsch: Das Ende einer Legende.

==Synopsis==
In 2010, Superintendent of Public Schools for Bertie County, Chip Zullinger (1951-2014) had been hired to address the school district's serious shortcomings.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;  After completing four large architectural projects with designer Emily Pilloton (author of the 2009 book ''Design Revolution'') and architect Matt Miller,&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Zullinger invited the two to create a high school curriculum.

Pilloton and Miller described the curriculum, ultimately named '''''Studio H''''', as [[Industrial arts|shop class]] for the 21st century, where the design process could address the community's problems and its own sense of possibility. Named after its focus on "humanity, habitats, health and happiness,"&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news

Pilloton and partner Miller, worked with 10 (initially 13)&lt;ref name="the.only"/&gt; high school students at Bertie Early College High School through the year-long,  full-scale design/build curriculum &amp;mdash; following six design rules: there is no design without critical action; we work 'with' not 'for;' we start locally and scale globally; create systems, not stuff; document, share and measure; and finally build.

The project team and the community had identified a new farmer's market as a viable and desirable community project, and under the leadership of Pilloton and Miller the students focused on developing design and construction skills: critical thinking, research (e.g., analyzing Buckminster Fuller's [[Dymaxion House]]), sketching, and drafting, along with welding and real-world construction trades. Pilloton and Miller in turn completed construction documents and specifications, worked with a structural engineer and filed for construction permits &amp;mdash; while also preparing and conducting three hours of daily classroom instruction.&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;{{cite news

The film backtracks to tell the story of Matt Miller and his thesis project from the Cranbrook Academy, where he designed and constructed along with classmate Thomas Gardner a 900 sf, two-story infill house.&lt;ref name="house"&gt;{{cite news

Together the Project H team identified student Stevie Mizelle's preliminary concept model to develop further, subsequently completing construction of the farmer's market to approximately 75% before the school year ended.  The design features a large wood platform for vendor booths with vertical wood trusses supporting a rectilinear roofed canopy with wood slats designed to filter and control solar glare; a main floor at the same height above grade as a pickup truck bed, allowing vendors to back up to the "loading dock" at each vendor stall and walk their goods directly off their truck into their booth; and a long ramp at the front to allow pedestrian accessibility and to provide a symbolic front porch for visitors.&lt;ref name="studioh2"&gt;{{cite news

Early in the school year, Pilloton and Miller chose to continue with the project after Zullinger, their prime backer, was dismissed by the school board, and the board became unwilling to underwrite the curriculum and withdrew their offered salaries.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Pilloton and Miller continued to work with the students and subsequently completed construction of the farmer's market after the school year ended.  The Windsor Super Market opened in October 2011.

Students featured in ''Studio H'' were Erick Bowen, Rodecoe Dunlow, Kerron Hayes, Anthony Johnson, Stevie Mizelle, Cameron Perry, Cj Robertson, Jamesha Thompson, Colin White and Alexia Williams.  The film also features County Commissioner Ron Wesson as well as volunteer Eric Wandmacher (friend of Pilloton and Miller) and Superintendent of Public Schools, Chip Zullinger.&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;{{cite news

==Background==

{{quote box |quote =  
My goal in going in to Bertie County was not to go in and just design for them, but to really teach their kids about the design process and do something for the community with their high school students. That, in a way, transcends a lot of this social design movement stuff ... and hopefully [it's] the next phase of what that movement can be.|source= —Matthew Miller'' &lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;}}

Prior to one-year '''''Studio H''''' curriculum in Bertie County, Pilloton and Miller had completed four architectural projects with the school board, as backed by Superintendent Zullinger: four playgrounds, three computer labs, a weight room for the football team, and a county-wide graphic campaign.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Friction on the school board developed with another Zullinger-backed project, "Connect Bertie," a project to bring free county-wide internet connectivity by paying an outside entity, [[Century Link]], to provide the internet services at a cost of $2 million annually.  The tension culminated with Zullwinger's dismissal, followed a reversal of the dismissal and then acceptance of his resignation.  Without his support and the offered salaries, Zullwinger's departure directly threatened the Studio H project.&lt;ref name="zull"&gt;{{cite news

Other tensions arose, and in a 2013 interview, Pilloton identified a racially and politically charged context that surrounded the curriculum and the project &amp;mdash; describing Bertie County as a place where "hundreds of years of slavery and institutionalized racism is very much still alive and kicking."&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; On release of the film, Pilloton and Miller said "they said they still believe it was fear of change – not lack of money in a budget that topped $30 million – that ultimately led to the board's decision."&lt;ref name="fear of change"&gt;{{cite news

Pilloton had grown up near [[Mt. Tamalpais]], California, attributing the German toy ''Quadro'' with inspiring her interest in design.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;  She later studied at the [[College of Environmental Design, UC Berkeley]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], during a period when there was no curriculum but when there was a 100,000 sf shop class.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;

Matt Miller was born in [[West Virginia]] and has architecture degrees from the [[University of Tennessee]] and [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]].  He has taught architecture and design at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], the [[College of Creative Studies]], and UC Berkeley &amp;mdash; and worked with [[Architecture for Humanity]].  Miller was the first student at the Cranbrook Academy to design and also build his thesis project (along with classmate Thomas Gardner): a 900 sf, two-story block infill house&lt;ref name="house"/&gt; at 2126 Pierce Street in [[Poletown East, Detroit|Poletown, Detroit]].  The house, ultimately abandoned,&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; had a construction budget of $60,000 and used all-volunteer labor along with carefully selected materials (e.g., concrete block and rubber membrane roofing) to keep costs down.&lt;ref name="house"/&gt;

==Reception==
As of mid-2014, the film had received a rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] of 81% favorable critic response and 100% favorable audience response.&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite news

  | publisher = Rottentomatoes.com
  | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/if_you_build_it/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Architectural Record]]'' called the film "A document of America at its most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="film82"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' reviewer Nicolas Rapold said "the movie's biggest weakness comes with its tendency to film people telling us what's going on rather than having us observe."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news

==Follow up==
Pilloton and Miller, who had been a couple, split up&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt; some time after the period depicted in the documentary.  Matthew Miller is now the lead design/build instructor at '''''(co)studio''''', a public high school program in [[Carbondale, Colorado]].  Pilloton continues to direct Studio H, which is now in its fourth year, at the at REALM Charter School in [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;

Studio H has grown to include more than 200 students,&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news

At a point early in the film, student Stevie Mizelle &amp;mdash; whose preliminary design for the farmer's market was ultimately selected by the team for design development &amp;mdash; joked: "school, I hate it, my dad hated it, my granddaddy hated it. I'm carrying on a tradition."  He currently studies animal behavior at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, making Dean's List his freshman year.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;  He was the first male relative in his immediate family to graduate from high school, attributing his graduation to his work with Studio H.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4666">The '''International Network of Engineers and Scientists for global responsibility''' (INES) is an independent non-profit-organization concerned about the impact of science and technology on society. 

INES efforts focus on [[disarmament]] and international peace, ethics in science, responsibilities of scientists and the responsible use of science and technology, just and [[sustainable development]].

INES was founded in 1991 in [[Berlin]] at the international congress Challenges - Science and Peace in a Rapidly Changing Environment and has become a network of over 200 organisations and individual members.

== Challenges for Scientists and Engineers ==
Rapid changes in our environment and our societies are forcing us to become more conscious of our role in the world. Science and technology are employed in a worldwide competition for military and economic power. The impacts of this competition have global implications. We have entered a phase in which global developments are in conflict with basic requirements for human survival. Large stocks of weapons of mass destruction, the [[overexploitation]] of limited common resources, and a heavily unbalanced world economy provide fundamental challenges to human civilisation and may even threaten its existence.

Engineers and scientists play a key role, both in developing new knowledge that might threaten international security and in providing positive solutions for the future. They are as much a part of the problem as they can be a part of the solution.

== Activities ==
* Lobbies for [[nuclear disarmament]] and sustainable science.
* Works for the reduction of military spending.
* Promotes the awareness of ethical principles and the specific responsibility of engineers and scientists.
* Participates in [[whistleblowing]] campaigns, which support those who have been victimised for acting upon such principles.
* Encourages and facilitates public discourse and international communication among concerned scientists.
* Organises international conferences and regional workshops.
* Raises public awareness.
* Promotes environmentally sound technologies.
* Supports publishing books, e.g., Einstein, Peace Now!; Joseph Rotblat: Visionary for Peace. 

INES is a member of the [[International_Peace_Bureau|International Peace Bureau (IPB)]] and closely cooperates with IPB as well as the [[International_Physicians_for_the_Prevention_of_Nuclear_War|International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW)]] and the [[International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms]] (IALANA).

INES actively participates in the [[Middle_Powers_Initiative|Middle Powers Initiative (MPI)]] and has been present at the [[European_Social_Forum|European Social Forums]] since 2000 and at the [[World_Social_Forum|World Social Forums]]. INES participates in the [http://fm-sciences.org/?lang=en World Social Forum on Sciences].

== Goals ==
* [[Nuclear_Non-Proliferation_Treaty|Abolition of nuclear weapons]]
* Promoting the responsible and sustainable use of science and technology
* Implementing ethical principles in the education of scientists and engineers

'''Jonah''' or '''Jonas'''{{efn|{{Hebrew Name|יוֹנָה|Yona, Biblically transliterated '''Yonah'''|Yônā|dove}}; {{lang-ar|يونس}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Yūnus, Yūnis}}'' or {{lang|ar|يونان}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Yūnān }}''; [[Latin]]: ''Ionas''}} is the name given in the [[Hebrew Bible]] ([[Tanakh]]/[[Old Testament]]) to a [[prophet]] of the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]] in about the 8th century [[Common Era|BCE]]. He is the eponymous central figure of the [[Book of Jonah]], in which he is called upon by [[Yahweh|God]] to travel to [[Nineveh]] and warn its residents to repent of their [[sin]]s or face [[Divine retribution|divine wrath]]. Instead, Jonah boards a ship to [[Tarshish#In later history|Tarshish]]. Caught in a storm, he orders the ship's crew to cast him overboard, whereupon he is swallowed by a giant fish. Three days later, after Jonah agrees to go to Nineveh, the fish vomits him out onto the shore. Jonah successfully convinces the entire city of Nineveh to repent, but waits outside the city in expectation of its destruction. God shields Jonah from the sun with a [[kikayon|plant]], but later sends a worm to cause it to wither. When Jonah complains of the bitter heat, God rebukes him.

In [[Judaism]], the story of Jonah represents the teaching of ''[[Repentance in Judaism|teshuva]]'', which is the ability to repent and be forgiven by [[God in Judaism|God]]. In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] calls himself "greater than Jonah" and promises the [[Pharisees]] "the sign of Jonah", which is [[Resurrection of Jesus|his resurrection]]. Early [[Christianity|Christian]] interpreters viewed Jonah as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] for Jesus. Later, during the [[Reformation]], Jonah came to be seen instead as an [[archetype]] for the "envious Jew". Jonah is regarded as a prophet in [[Islam]] and the [[Bible|biblical]] narrative of Jonah is repeated, with a few notable differences, in the [[Quran]]. Mainstream [[Biblical criticism|Bible scholars]] generally regard the Book of Jonah as [[fiction]]al{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}} and often at least partially [[satire|satirical]],{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=105–107}}{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=18–19}} but the character of Jonah may have been based on the historical prophet of the same name mentioned in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|14:25|HE}}.

Although the word "whale" is often used in English versions of the Jonah story, the Hebrew text actually uses the phrase  ''dag gadol'', which means "giant fish". In the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the species of the fish that swallowed Jonah was the subject of speculation for [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalists]], who interpreted the story as an account of a historical incident. Some modern scholars of folklore have noted similarities between Jonah and other legendary figures, such as [[Gilgamesh]] and the Greek hero [[Jason]].

==Book of Jonah==
[[File:Pieter Lastman - Jonah and the Whale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''Jonah and the Whale'' (1621) by [[Pieter Lastman]]]]
Jonah is the central character in the Book of Jonah, in which [[Yahweh|God]] commands him to go to the city of [[Nineveh]] to prophesy against it "for their great wickedness is come up before me,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:2|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Jonah instead attempts to flee from "the presence of the Lord" by going to [[Jaffa]] (sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] as ''Joppa'' or ''Joppe''), and sailing to [[Tarshish#In later history|Tarshish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:3|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge storm arises and the sailors, realizing that it is no ordinary storm, [[Cleromancy|cast lots]] and discover that Jonah is to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:4-7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah admits this and states that if he is thrown overboard, the storm will cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:8-12|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sailors refuse to do this and continue rowing, but all their efforts fail and they are eventually forced to throw Jonah overboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:13-15|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the storm calms and the sailors then offer sacrifices to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:15-16|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah is miraculously saved by being swallowed by a large fish, in whose belly he spends three days and three nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|1:17|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in the great fish, Jonah prays to God in his affliction and commits to thanksgiving and to paying what he has vowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|2:1-9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God then commands the fish to vomit Jonah out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|2:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dore jonah.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|''[[Gustave Doré's illustrations for La Grande Bible de Tours|Jonah Preaching to the Ninevites]]'' (1866) by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

God again commands Jonah to travel to Nineveh and prophesy to its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:1-2|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This time he goes and enters the city, crying, "In forty days Nineveh shall be overthrown."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:2-4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Jonah has walked across Nineveh, the people of Nineveh begin to believe his word and proclaim a fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king of Nineveh puts on sackcloth and sits in ashes, making a proclamation which decrees fasting, the wearing of sackcloth, prayer, and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:6-9|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God sees their repentant hearts and spares the city at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:10|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire city is humbled and broken with the people (and even the animals)&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:8|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} in sackcloth and ashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|3:|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Displeased by this, Jonah refers to his earlier flight to Tarshish while asserting that, since God is merciful, it was inevitable that God would turn from the threatened calamities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:1-4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then leaves the city and makes himself a shelter, waiting to see whether or not the city will be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:5|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; God causes a plant (in Hebrew a ''[[kikayon]]'') to grow over Jonah's shelter to give him some shade from the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:6|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, God causes a worm to bite the plant's root and it withers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:7|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah, now being exposed to the full force of the sun, becomes faint and pleads for God to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:8|9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|And God said to Jonah: "Art thou greatly angry for the Kikayon?" And he said: "I am greatly angry, even unto death."&lt;br /&gt;And the LORD said: "Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night;&lt;br /&gt;and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?"|Book of Jonah, {{Bibleverse||Jonah|4:9-11|9|chapter 4, verses 9-11}}}}

The Book of Jonah (Yonah יונה) is one of the twelve [[minor prophets]] included in the Tanakh. According to one tradition, Jonah was the boy brought back to life by [[Elijah]] the prophet in {{bibleverse||1 Kings|17|9}}.{{sfn|Green|2005|pages=126–127}} Another tradition holds that he was the son of the [[woman of Shunem]] brought back to life by [[Elisha]] in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|4|9}}{{sfn|Green|2005|page=127}} and that he is called the "son of [[Amittai]]" (''Truth'') due to his mother's recognition of Elisha's identity as a prophet in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|17:24|9}}.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=127}} The Book of Jonah is read every year, in its original Hebrew and in its entirety, on [[Yom Kippur]] – the Day of Atonement, as the [[Haftarah]] at the afternoon [[mincha]] prayer.{{sfn|Mirsky|1990|page=354}}{{sfn|Isaacs|2006|page=65}} According to [[Rabbi Eliezer]], the fish that swallowed Jonah was created in the primordial era{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and the inside of its mouth was like a [[synagogue]];{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} the fish's eyes were like windows{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and a pearl inside its mouth provided further illumination.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}}

According to the [[Midrash]], while Jonah was inside the fish, it told him that its life was nearly over because soon the [[Leviathan]] would eat them both.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} Jonah promised the fish that he would save them.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} Following Jonah's directions, the fish swam up alongside the Leviathan{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} and Jonah threatened to leash the Leviathan by its tongue and let the other fish eat it.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} The Leviathan heard Jonah's threats, saw that he was [[circumcision|circumcized]], and realized that he was protected by the [[God in Judaism|Lord]],{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} so it fled in terror, leaving Jonah and the fish alive.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=128}} The medieval Jewish scholar and rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] (1092 – 1167) argued against any literal interpretation of the Book of Jonah,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=20}} stating that the "experiences of all the prophets except Moses were visions, not actualities."{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=20}} The later scholar [[Isaac Abarbanel]] (1437 – 1509), however, argued that Jonah could have easily survived in the belly of the fish for three days,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=18}} because "after all, fetuses live nine months without access to fresh air."{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=18–19}}

[[Repentance in Judaism|Teshuva]] – the ability to repent and be forgiven by God – is a prominent idea in Jewish thought. This concept is developed in the Book of Jonah: Jonah, the son of truth (the name of his father "Amitai" in Hebrew means truth), refuses to ask the people of [[Nineveh]] to repent. He seeks the truth only, and not forgiveness. When forced to go, his call is heard loud and clear. The people of Nineveh repent ecstatically, "fasting, including the sheep," and the Jewish scripts are critical of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Babylonian Talmud | chapter = Sanhedrin | at = 61a}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Jonah also highlights the sometimes unstable relationship between two religious needs: comfort and truth.&lt;ref&gt;Bashevkin, Dovid.

====In the Book of Tobit====
Jonah is mentioned twice in the fourteenth chapter of the [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]] [[Book of Tobit]],{{sfn|Bredin|2006|pages=47–50}} the conclusion of which finds Tobit's son, Tobias, at the extreme age of 127 years, rejoicing at the news of Nineveh's destruction by [[Nebuchadnezzar]] and [[Ahasuerus]] in apparent fulfillment of Jonah's prophecy against the Assyrian capital.{{sfn|Bredin|2006|pages=47–50}}

====In the New Testament====
In the [[New Testament]], Jonah is mentioned in {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:38–41|9}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|16:4|9}} and in {{bibleverse||Luke|11:29–32|9}}.{{sfn|Limburg|1993|page=39}} In the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Jesus]] makes a reference to Jonah when he is asked for a sign by some of the scribes and the [[Pharisees]].{{sfn|Stein|1994|page=3}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=167}} Jesus says that the sign will be the [[Typology (theology)#Example of Jonah|sign of Jonah]]:{{sfn|Stein|1994|page=3}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=167}} Jonah's restoration after three days inside the great fish prefigures [[Resurrection of Jesus|His own resurrection]].{{sfn|Stein|1994|page=3}}

But none will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish, so the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. &lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt;The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it; for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and now something greater than Jonah is here."|Gospel of Matthew, {{Bibleref2-nb|Matthew|12:39–41|NIV}} ([[New International Version]])}}

Jonah is regarded as a saint by a number of [[Christian]] denominations. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is on 21 September, according to the ''[[Roman Martyrology|Martyrologium Romanum]]''.&lt;ref name="MR"/&gt; On the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]], Jonah's feast day is on 22 September (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian calendar]]; 22 September currently falls in October on the modern [[Gregorian calendar]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lives of all saints commemorated on September 22 |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://oca.org/saints/all-lives/2017/09/22+%22Prophet+Jonah%22 |publisher=Orthodox Church in America |date=22 September 2017 |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], moveable feasts are held in commemoration of Jonah as a single prophet and as one of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commemoration of the Prophet Jonah |url=http://armenianchurch.ge/en/component/content/article/36-february/80-prophetjonah |publisher=Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Holy Church in Georgia |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commemoration of the 12 Minor Prophets |url=http://armenianchurch.ge/en/component/content/article/41-july/127-12minorprophets |publisher=Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Holy Church in Georgia |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commemoration Day of the 12 Minor Prophets. 24 July 2018|url=http://ststepanos.org/calendar/commemoration-day-of-the-12-minor-prophets/2018-07-24/ |publisher=Saint Stepanos Armenian Apostolic Church of Elberon in New Jersey |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah's mission to the Ninevites is commemorated by the [[Fast of Nineveh]] in [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac]] and [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]] Churches.&lt;ref name=SycOrth&gt;{{cite web|title=Three day fast of Nineveh |url=http://sor.cua.edu/Feast/NinevehFast.html |publisher=Syriac Orthodox Resources |date=8 February 1998 |accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonah is commemorated as a prophet in the [[Calendar of Saints (Lutheran)|Calendar of Saints]] of the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod of the Lutheran Church]] on 22 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Commemoration of Jonah, Prophet, 22 September |url=https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=%22Lutheran+Church+Missouri+Synod%22%22The+Commemoration+of+Jonah,+Prophet,+22+September%22 |publisher=Concordia and Koinonia |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian theology|Christian theologians]] have traditionally interpreted Jonah as a [[Typology (theology)|type]] for [[Jesus Christ]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–20}} Jonah being in swallowed by the giant fish was regarded as a foreshadowing of [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus's crucifixion]]{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–13}} and the fish vomiting Jonah out onto the beach was seen as a parallel for [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus's resurrection]].{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=11–13}} [[Saint Jerome]] equates Jonah with Jesus's more [[nationalism|nationalistic]] side,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=20}} and justifies Jonah's actions by arguing that "Jonah acts thus as a patriot, not so much that he hates the Ninevites, as that he does not want to destroy his own people."{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=20}}

Other Christian interpreters, including [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Martin Luther]], have taken a directly opposite approach,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=23–25}} regarding Jonah as the epitome of envy and jealousness, which they regarded as inherent characteristics of the Jewish people.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} Luther likewise concludes that the ''kikayon'' represents Judaism,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=23–24}} and that the worm which devours it represents Christ.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=24}} Luther also questioned the idea that the Book of Jonah was ever intended as literal history,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} commenting that he found it hard to believe that anyone would have interpreted it as such if it had never been included in the Bible.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Luther's [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] interpretation of Jonah remained the prevailing interpretation among German Protestants throughout early modern history.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=24–26}} [[J. D. Michaelis]] comments that "the meaning of the fable hits you right between the eyes",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} and concludes that the Book of Jonah is a polemic against "the Israelite people's hate and envy towards all the other nations of the earth."{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=25}} [[Albert Eichhorn]] was a strong supporter of Michaelis's interpretation.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=25–26}}

[[John Calvin]] and [[John Hooper (bishop)|John Hooper]] regarded the Book of Jonah as a warning to all those who might attempt to flee from the wrath of God.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=32–33}} While Luther had been careful to maintain that the Book of Jonah was not written by Jonah,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Calvin declared that the Book of Jonah was Jonah's personal confession of guilt.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Calvin sees Jonah's time inside the fish's belly as equivalent to the fires of [[Hell]], intended to correct Jonah and set him on the path of righteousness.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=34–36}} Also unlike Luther, Calvin finds fault with all the characters in the story,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} describing the sailors on the boat as "hard and iron-hearted, like [[Cyclops]]",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} the penitence of the Ninevites as "untrained",{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} and the king of Nineveh as a "novice".{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=33}} Hooper, on the other hand, sees Jonah as the [[archetype|archetypal]] [[dissident]]{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} and the ship he is cast out from as a symbol of the state.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} Hooper deplores such dissidents,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=39–40}} decrying: "Can you live quietly with so many Jonasses? Nay then, throw them into the sea!"{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=40}} In the eighteenth century, German professors were forbidden from teaching that the Book of Jonah was anything other than a literal, historical account.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}}

====In the Quran====
'''Jonah''' ([[Arabic]]: يُونُس Yūnus) is the title of the [[tenth chapter of the Quran]]. He is traditionally viewed as highly important in [[Islam]] as a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] who was faithful to [[God in Islam|Allah]] and delivered His messages. Jonah is mentioned four times in the [[Quran]]{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} and is the only one of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets]] to be mentioned by name.&lt;ref name="Islam, pg. 348" /&gt; In [[Surah]] 68:48, Jonah is called '''Dhul-Nun''' ([[Arabic]]: '''ذو النون'''; meaning ''The One of the Fish'').{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} In 4:163 and 6:86, he is referred to as "an apostle of Allah".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} Surah 37:139-148 retells the full story of Jonah:{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}}

{{Quote|So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).&lt;br&gt;When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,&lt;br&gt;He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned:&lt;br&gt;Then the big Fish did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.&lt;br&gt;Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,&lt;br&gt;He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the [[Last Judgment|Day of Resurrection]].&lt;br&gt;But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,&lt;br&gt;And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.&lt;br&gt;And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.&lt;br&gt;And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.|Quran, chapter 37 ([[As-Saaffat]]), [[ayah|verses]] 139–148&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|37|139|e=148|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Quran never mentions Jonah's father,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=67}} but [[Muslim]] [[tradition]] teaches that Jonah was from the [[tribe of Benjamin]] and that his father was [[Amittai]].&lt;ref name="Islam, pg. 348"&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Yunus'', pg. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonah is also mentioned in a few incidents during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. In some instances, Jonah's name is spoken of with praise and reverence by Muhammad. According to historical [[Hadith|narrations about Muhammad's life]], after ten years of receiving revelations, Muhammad went to the city of [[Ta’if]] to see if its leaders would allow him to preach his message from there rather than [[Mecca]], but he was cast from the city by the people. He took shelter in the garden of Utbah and Shaybah, two members of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe. They sent their servant, [[Addas]], to serve him grapes for sustenance. Muhammad asked Addas where he was from and the servant replied Nineveh. "The town of Jonah the just, son of Amittai!" Muhammad exclaimed. Addas was shocked because he knew that the pagan Arabs had no knowledge of the prophet Jonah. He then asked how Muhammad knew of this man. "We are brothers" Muhammad replied. "Jonah was a Prophet of God and I, too, am a Prophet of God." Addas immediately accepted Islam and kissed the hands and feet of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized from ''The Life of the Prophet'' by [[Ibn Hisham]] Volume 1 pp. 419–421&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sayings of Muhammad, in the collection of [[Imam Bukhari]], says that Muhammad said "One should not say that I am better than Jonah".&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|55|608}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wheeler|2002|page=172}}{{sfn|Graham|1977|page=167}}{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} A similar statement occurs in a hadith written by [[Yazid I|Yunus bin Yazid]], the second [[caliph]] of the [[Umayyad Dynasty]].{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} Umayya ibn Abi al-Salt, an older contemporary of Muhammad, taught that, had Jonah not prayed to Allah, he would have remained trapped inside the fish until Judgement Day,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} but, because of his prayer, Jonah "stayed only a few days within the belly of the fish".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}}

The ninth-century Persian historian [[Al-Tabari]] records that, while Jonah was inside the fish, "none of his bones or members were injured".{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} Al-Tabari also writes that Allah made the body of the fish transparent, allowing Jonah to see the "wonders of the deep"{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=74}} and that Jonah heard all the fish singing praises to Allah.{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=74}} [[Kisai Marvazi]], a tenth-century poet, records that Jonah's father was seventy years old when Jonah was born{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} and that he died soon afterwards,{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}} leaving Jonah's mother with nothing but a wooden spoon, which turned out to be a [[cornucopia]].{{sfn|Vicchio|2008|page=73}}

==Scholarly interpretations==
===Historicity===
The consensus of mainstream [[Biblical criticism|Biblical scholars]] holds that the contents of the [[Book of Jonah]] are entirely ahistorical.{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=140}}{{sfn|Levine|2000|pages=71–72}}{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}} Although the prophet Jonah allegedly lived in the eighth century BCE,{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}} the Book of Jonah was written centuries later during the time of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=15–16}} The [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] used in the Book of Jonah shows strong influences from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}} and the cultural practices described in it match those of the Achaemenid Persians.{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} Many scholars regard the Book of Jonah as an intentional work of [[parody]] or [[satire]].{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=105–107}}{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=18–19}}{{sfn|Ingram|2012|pages=140–142}}{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}{{sfn|Person|1996|page=155}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}} If this is the case, then it was probably admitted into the canon of the [[Hebrew Bible]] by sages who misunderstood its satirical nature{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=106–107}}{{sfn|Person|1996|page=155}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}} and mistakenly interpreted it as a serious prophetic work.{{sfn|Band|2003|pages=106–107}}{{sfn|Person|1996|page=155}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}}

While the Book of Jonah itself is considered fiction,{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=140}}{{sfn|Levine|2000|pages=71–72}}{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}} Jonah himself may have been a historical prophet;{{sfn|Kripke|1980|pages=67–68}} he is briefly mentioned in the [[Books of Kings|Second Book of Kings]]:{{sfn|Doyle|2005|page=124}}{{sfn|Kripke|1980|page=67}}
{{quote|He restored the border of Israel from the entrance of [[Hama]]th unto the sea of the [[Arabah]], according to the word of the [[Yahweh|LORD]], the [[National god|God of Israel]], which He spoke by the hand of His servant Jonah the son of [[Amittai]], the prophet, who was of [[Gath-hepher]].|{{bibleverse|2 Kings|14:25|HE}}, JPS (1917)}}
Most scholars believe that the anonymous author of the Book of Jonah may have seized upon this obscure prophet from 2 Kings and used him as the basis for the fictional character of Jonah,{{sfn|Doyle|2005|pages=124–125}} but some have contended that the figure of Jonah himself is entirely legendary.{{sfn|Levine|2000|pages=71–72}}

===Parodic elements===

The views expressed by Jonah in the Book of Jonah are a [[parody]] of views held by members of Jewish society at the time when it was written.{{sfn|Ben Zvi|2003|pages=18–19}}{{sfn|Band|2003|page=106}}{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} The primary target of the satire may have been a faction whom [[Morton Smith]] calls "Separationists",{{sfn|Band|2003|page=105}} who believed that God would destroy those who disobeyed him,{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} that sinful cities would be obliterated,{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} and that God's mercy did not extend to those outside the [[Abrahamic covenant]].{{sfn|Band|2003|page=105}} McKenzie and Graham remark that "Jonah is in some ways the most 'orthodox' of Israelite theologians – to make a theological point."{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}} Jonah's statements throughout the book are characterized by their militancy,{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=142}} but his name ironically means "dove",{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}{{sfn|Ingram|2012|page=142}} a bird which the ancient Israelites associated with peace.{{sfn|McKenzie|Graham|1998|page=113}}

Jonah's rejection of God's commands is a parody of the obedience of the prophets described in other Old Testament writings.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=22}} The king of Nineveh's instant repentance parodies the rulers throughout the other writings of the Old Testament who disregard prophetic warnings, such as [[Ahab]] and [[Zedekiah]].{{sfn|Gaines|2003|pages=22–23}} The readiness to worship God displayed by the sailors on the ship and the people of Nineveh contrasts ironically with Jonah's own reluctance,{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=23}} as does Jonah's greater love for ''kikayon'' providing him shade than for all the people in Nineveh.{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=23}}

The Book of Jonah also employs elements of [[absurdist fiction|literary absurdism]];{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} it exaggerates the size of the city of Nineveh to an implausible degree{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} and incorrectly refers to the administrator of the city as a "king".{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} According to scholars, no human being could realistically survive for three days inside a fish,{{sfn|Levine|2000|page=71}} and the description of the livestock in Nineveh fasting alongside their owners is "silly".{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=25}} The motif of a protagonist being swallowed by a giant fish or whale became a stock [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of later satirical writings.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|pages=74–81}} Similar incidents are recounted in [[Lucian|Lucian of Samosata]]'s ''[[True History|A True Story]]'', which was written in the second century CE,{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|page=76-77}} and in the novel ''[[Baron Munchausen's Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia]]'', published by [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]] in 1785.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|pages=77–78}} The story of a man surviving after being swallowed by a whale or giant fish is classified as [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|ATU]] 1889G.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|2007|page=78}}

[[File:Germany Worms Cathedral Jonah.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Jonah and the "great fish" on the south doorway of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-era [[Worms Cathedral|Dom St. Peter]], in [[Worms, Germany]]]]

Though it is often called a whale today, the Hebrew, as throughout scripture, refers to no species in particular, simply saying "great fish" or "big fish" (whales are today classified as [[mammal]]s and not fish, but no such distinction was made in antiquity). While some biblical scholars suggest the size and habits of the [[great white shark]] correspond better to the representations given of Jonah's being swallowed, normally an adult human is too large to be swallowed whole.&lt;ref name="Falwell"&gt;[http://www.liberty.edu/wwwadmin/includes/search/qanda/QandA_Results_elmertowns.cfm?Searched=&amp;AID=274&amp;DisplayResults=1 Theological Topic Search] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927230239/http://www.liberty.edu/wwwadmin/includes/search/qanda/QandA_Results_elmertowns.cfm?Searched=&amp;AID=274&amp;DisplayResults=1 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[whaling]] from the 18th century onwards made it clear that most, if not all, species of whale were incapable of swallowing a man, leading to much controversy about the veracity of the biblical story of Jonah.&lt;ref name="Kemp1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Peter Kemp|title=The Oxford Companion to Ships &amp; the Sea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VmnPwAACAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-586-08308-6|page=434|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217011744/https://books.google.com/books?id=8VmnPwAACAAJ|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point ''cetus'' became synonymous with "whale" (the study of whales is now called ''[[cetology]]''). In his 1534 translation, [[William Tyndale]] translated the phrase in Jonah 2:1 as "greate fyshe" and the word ''kétos'' (Greek) or ''cetus'' (Latin) in {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:40|9}} as "whale". Tyndale's translation was later incorporated into the [[King James Version|Authorized Version]] of 1611. Since then, the "great fish" in Jonah 2 has been most often interpreted as a whale. In English some translations use the word "whale" for Matthew 12:40, while others use "sea creature" or "big fish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=How Did God Do It?

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalists]], interpreting the Jonah story as a historical account, became obsessed with trying to identify the exact species of the fish that swallowed Jonah.{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=42–45}} In the mid-nineteenth century, [[Edward Bouverie Pusey]], professor of Hebrew at [[Oxford University]], claimed that the Book of Jonah must have been authored by Jonah himself{{sfn|Green|2011|page=48}} and argued that the fish story must be historically true, or else it would not have been included in the Bible.{{sfn|Green|2011|page=48}} Pusey attempted to scientifically catalogue the fish,{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=47–48}} hoping to "shame those who speak of the miracle of Jonah's preservation in the fish as a thing less credible than any of God's other miraculous doings".{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|page=48}}

The debate over the fish in the Book of Jonah played a major role during [[Clarence Darrow]]'s cross-examination of [[William Jennings Bryan]] at the [[Scopes Trial]] in 1925.{{sfn|Smolla|1997}}{{sfn|Lidz|2016}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Darrow asked Bryan "When you read that... the whale swallowed Jonah... how do you literally interpret that?"{{sfn|Smolla|1997}} Bryan replied that "a God who can make a whale and can make a man and make both of them do what He pleases."{{sfn|Smolla|1997}}{{sfn|Gaines|2003|page=19}} Bryan ultimately admitted that it was necessary to interpret the Bible,{{sfn|Smolla|1997}} and is generally regarded as having come off looking like a "buffoon".{{sfn|Lidz|2016}}

The largest whales—[[baleen whale]]s, a group which includes the [[blue whale]]—eat [[plankton]] and "it is commonly said that this species would be choked if it attempted to swallow a herring."&lt;ref&gt;Lydekker's New Natural History, Vol, III, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  As for the [[whale shark]], Dr. E. W. Gudger, an Honorary Associate in [[Ichthyology]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], notes that, while the whale shark does have a large mouth,{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} its throat is only four inches wide, with a sharp elbow or bend behind the opening,{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} meaning that not even a human arm would be able to pass through it.{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}} He concludes that "the whale shark is not the fish that swallowed Jonah."{{sfn|Gudger|1940|page=227}}

Despite its brevity, the Book of Jonah has been adapted numerous times in literature and in popular culture.{{sfn|Green|2005|page=xv}}{{sfn|Sherwood|2000|pages=71–72}} In [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (1851), [[Father Mapple]] delivers a sermon on the Book of Jonah. Mapple asks why Jonah does not show remorse for disobeying God while he is inside of the fish. He comes to the conclusion that Jonah admirably understands that "his dreadful punishment is just."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mosaicmagazine.com/picks/2017/07/the-problem-with-herman-melvilles-reading-of-the-book-of-jonah/|title=The Problem with Herman Melville’s Reading of the Book of Jonah|last=Lewis|first=John|publisher=''[[Mosaic (magazine)|Mosaic]]''|date=2017-07-21|access-date=2018-01-03|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213205630/https://mosaicmagazine.com/picks/2017/07/the-problem-with-herman-melvilles-reading-of-the-book-of-jonah/|archivedate=2018-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlo Collodi]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' (1883) features the [[Pinocchio|title character]] and his father [[Mister Geppetto|Geppetto]] being swallowed by a whale, an allusion to the story of Jonah.{{sfn|Marrone|2007|page=486}} [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|1940 film adaptation]] of the novel retains this allusion.{{sfn|Pinsky|2004|page=31}} The story of Jonah was adapted into [[Phil Vischer]] and [[Mike Nawrocki]]'s [[Animation|animated film]] ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]'' (2002).

[[Joseph Campbell]] suggests that the story of Jonah parallels a scene from the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', in which [[Gilgamesh]] obtains a plant from the bottom of the sea.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} In the Book of Jonah, a [[worm]] (in Hebrew ''tola'ath'', "maggot") bites the shade-giving plant's root causing it to wither;{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} whereas in the ''Epic of Gilgamesh'', Gilgamesh ties stones to his feet and plucks his plant from the floor of the sea.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|pages=118–119}} Once he returns to the shore, the rejuvenating plant is eaten by a serpent.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=119}}

Campbell also noted several similarities between the story of Jonah and that of [[Jason]] in Greek mythology.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} The Greek rendering of the name Jonah is ''Jonas'', which differs from ''Jason'' only in the order of sounds—both ''o''s are [[omega]]s suggesting that Jason may have been confused with Jonah.{{sfn|Campbell|1988|pages=90–95}} Gildas Hamel, drawing on the Book of Jonah and [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] sources—including [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] and the accounts of [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus]] and [[Argonautica|Orphic Argonautica]]—identifies a number of shared motifs, including the names of the heroes, the presence of a dove, the idea of "fleeing" like the wind and causing a storm, the attitude of the sailors, the presence of a sea-monster or dragon threatening the hero or swallowing him, and the form and the word used for the "gourd" (kikayon).{{sfn|Hamel|2015|pages=1–20}} Hamel takes the view that it was the Hebrew author who reacted to and adapted this mythological material to communicate his own, quite different message.{{sfn|Hamel|2015|pages=18–20}}

'''Julian day''' is the continuous count of days since the beginning of the Julian Period and is used primarily by [[Astronomy|astronomers]], and in [[software]] for easily calculating elapsed days between two events (e.g. food production date and sell by date)&lt;ref&gt;"Julian date" n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Julian Day Number '''('''JDN''') is the integer assigned to a whole solar day in the Julian day count starting from noon [[Universal time]], with Julian day number 0 assigned to the day starting at noon on Monday, January 1, [[4713 BC|4713&amp;nbsp;BC]], [[proleptic Julian calendar]] (November 24, 4714&amp;nbsp;BC, in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]),&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz &amp; Reingold 2008, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seidelman 2013, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Astronomical Almanac Online" 2016, Glossary, s.v. Julian date. Various timescales may be used with Julian date, such as [[Terrestrial Time]] (TT) or Universal Time (UT); in precise work the timescale should be specified.&lt;/ref&gt;  a date at which three multi-year cycles started (which are: [[Indiction]], [[Solar cycle (calendar)|Solar]], and [[Metonic cycle|Lunar]] cycles) and which preceded any dates in recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;Both of these dates are years of the Christian or [[Common Era]] (which has no year 0 between 1 BC and AD 1). Astronomical calculations generally include a year 0, so these dates should be adjusted accordingly (i.e. the year 4713 BC becomes [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical year number]] &amp;minus;4712, etc.). In this article, dates before October 15, 1582 are in the (possibly proleptic) Julian calendar and dates on or after October 15, 1582 are in the Gregorian calendar, unless otherwise labelled.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Julian day number for the day starting at 12:00 [[Universal Time|UT]] on January 1, 2000, was 2&amp;nbsp;451&amp;nbsp;545.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy &amp; Guinot 2013, 91–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Julian date''' ('''JD''') of any instant is the Julian day number plus the fraction of a day since the preceding noon in Universal Time. Julian dates are expressed as a Julian day number with a decimal fraction added.&lt;ref name="IAU"&gt;"Resolution B1" 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Julian Date for 00:30:00.0 UT January 1, 2013, is 2&amp;nbsp;456&amp;nbsp;293.520&amp;nbsp;833.&lt;ref&gt;US Naval Observatory 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Julian Period''' is a [[Chronology|chronological]] interval of 7980 years; year 1 of the Julian Period was 4713&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomical Almanac for the year 2017'' p. B4, which states 2017 is year 6730 of the Julian Period.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by [[History|historians]] since its introduction in 1583 to convert between different [[calendar]]s. The Julian calendar year {{CURRENTYEAR}} is year {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}} + 4713 }} of the  current Julian Period. The next Julian Period begins in the year AD&amp;nbsp;3268.

== Terminology ==
The term ''Julian date'' may also refer, outside of astronomy, to the day-of-year number (more properly, the [[ordinal date]]) in the [[Gregorian calendar]], especially in computer programming, the military and the food industry,&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;USDA c. 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; or it may refer to dates in the [[Julian calendar]]. For example, if a given "Julian date" is "October 5, 1582", this means that date in the Julian calendar (which was October 15, 1582, in the Gregorian calendar—the date it was first established).  Without an astronomical or historical context, a "Julian date" given as "36" most likely means the 36th day of a given Gregorian year, namely February 5.  Other possible meanings of a "Julian date" of "36" include an astronomical Julian Day Number, or the year AD&amp;nbsp;36 in the Julian calendar, or a duration of 36&amp;nbsp;astronomical [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian years]]).  This is why the terms "ordinal date" or "day-of-year" are preferred.  In contexts where a "Julian date" means simply an ordinal date, calendars of a Gregorian year with formatting for ordinal dates are often called ''"Julian calendars"'',&lt;ref name="usda"/&gt; but this could also mean that the calendars are of years in the Julian calendar system.

Historical Julian dates were recorded relative to GMT or [[Ephemeris Time]], but the [[International Astronomical Union]] now recommends that Julian dates be specified in [[Terrestrial Time]], and that when necessary to specify Julian dates using a different time scale, that the time scale used be indicated when required, such as JD(UT1). The fraction of the day is found by converting the number of hours, minutes, and seconds after noon into the equivalent decimal fraction.  Time intervals calculated from differences of Julian Dates specified in non-uniform time scales, such as [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), may need to be corrected for changes in time scales (e.g. [[leap second]]s).&lt;ref name="IAU" /&gt;

== Variants ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Epoch (reference date)]] --&gt;
Because the starting point or [[Epoch (reference date)|reference epoch]] is so long ago, numbers in the Julian day can be quite large and cumbersome. A more recent starting point is sometimes used, for instance by dropping the leading digits, in order to fit into limited computer memory with an adequate amount of precision. In the following table, times are given in 24-hour notation.

In the table below, ''Epoch'' refers to the point in time used to set the origin (usually zero, but (1) where explicitly indicated) of the alternative convention being discussed in that row. The date given is a Gregorian calendar date if it is October 15, 1582, or later, but a Julian calendar date if it is earlier.  JD stands for Julian Date. 0h is 00:00 midnight, 12h is 12:00 noon, UT unless otherwise specified. Current value is as of {{CURRENTDATE}} and may be cached.

* The '''Modified Julian Date''' (MJD) was introduced by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in 1957 to record the orbit of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] via an [[IBM 704]] (36-bit machine) and using only 18 bits until August 7, 2576. MJD is the epoch of VAX/VMS and its successor [[OpenVMS#Timekeeping|OpenVMS]], using 63-bit date/time, which allows times to be stored up to July 31, 31086, 02:48:05.47.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vms.tuwien.ac.at/info/humour/vms-base-time-origin.txt|title=Wayback Machine|date=June 6, 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606064704/http://vms.tuwien.ac.at/info/humour/vms-base-time-origin.txt|archivedate=June 6, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MJD has a starting point of midnight on November 17, 1858 and is computed by MJD = JD - 2400000.5 &lt;ref&gt;Winkler n. d.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Truncated Julian Day''' (TJD) was introduced by [[NASA]]/[[Goddard Space Flight Center|Goddard]] in 1979 as part of a parallel grouped binary time code (PB-5) "designed specifically, although not exclusively, for spacecraft applications." TJD was a 4-digit day count from MJD 40000, which was May 24, 1968, represented as a 14-bit binary number.  Since this code was limited to four digits, TJD recycled to zero on MJD 50000, or October 10, 1995, "which gives a long ambiguity period of 27.4 years". (NASA codes PB-1—PB-4 used a 3-digit day-of-year count.) Only whole days are represented.  Time of day is expressed by a count of seconds of a day, plus optional milliseconds, microseconds and nanoseconds in separate fields.  Later PB-5J was introduced which increased the TJD field to 16 bits, allowing values up to 65535, which will occur in the year 2147.  There are five digits recorded after TJD 9999.&lt;ref&gt;Chi 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SPD Toolkit Time Notes 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Dublin Julian Date''' (DJD) is the number of days that has elapsed since the epoch of the solar and lunar [[ephemerides]] used from 1900 through 1983, [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun]] and [[Ernest W. Brown]]'s ''Tables of the Motion of the Moon'' (1919). This epoch was noon UT on [[:January 0]], 1900, which is the same as noon UT on December 31, 1899. The DJD was defined by the International Astronomical Union at their meeting in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Ransom c. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- THE REST OF THESE ARE NOT RELATED TO JD --&gt;
* The [[Lilian date|Lilian day number]] is a count of days of the Gregorian calendar and not defined relative to the Julian Date. It is an integer applied to a whole day; day 1 was October 15, 1582, which was the day the Gregorian calendar went into effect. The original paper defining it makes no mention of the time zone, and no mention of time-of-day.&lt;ref&gt;Ohms 1986&lt;/ref&gt; It was named for [[Aloysius Lilius]], the principal author of the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;IBM 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rata Die]] is a system used in [[Rexx]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html "Basic date and time types."] (March 27, 2017) ''The Python Standard Library''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Microsoft .NET]]. Some implementations or options use [[Universal Time]], others use local time. Day 1 is January 1, 1, that is, the first day of the [[Christian Era|Christian]] or [[Common Era]] in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz &amp; Reingold 2008, 10, 351, 353, Appendix B.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heliocentric Julian Day]] (HJD) is the same as the Julian day, but adjusted to the frame of reference of the [[Sun]], and thus can differ from the Julian day by as much as 8.3 minutes (498 seconds), that being the time it takes the Sun's light to reach [[Earth]].

To illustrate the ambiguity that could arise, consider the two separate astronomical measurements of an astronomical object from the earth: Assume that three objects—the Earth, the Sun, and the astronomical object targeted, that is whose distance is to be measured—happen to be in a straight line for both measures. However, for the first measurement, the Earth is between the Sun and the targeted object, and for the second, the Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun from that object. Then, the two measurements would differ by about 1000 light-seconds: For the first measurement, the Earth is roughly 500 light seconds closer to the target than the Sun, and roughly 500 light seconds further from the target astronomical object than the Sun for the second measure.

An error of about 1000 light-seconds is over 1% of a light-day, which can be a significant error when measuring temporal phenomena for short period astronomical objects over long time intervals. To clarify this issue, the ordinary Julian day is sometimes referred to as the '''Geocentric Julian Day''' (GJD) in order to distinguish it from HJD.

== History ==
The ''Julian day number'' is based on the ''Julian Period'' proposed by [[Joseph Justus Scaliger|Joseph Scaliger]], a classical scholar, in 1583, at the time of the Gregorian calendar reform, as it is the [[least common multiple]] of three calendar cycles used with the Julian calendar:

: 15 ([[indiction|indiction cycle]]) × 19 ([[Metonic cycle]]) × 28 ([[Solar cycle (calendar)|Solar cycle]]) = 7980 years

Its epoch falls at the last time when all three cycles (if they are continued backward far enough) were in their first year together &amp;mdash; Scaliger chose this because it preceded all historical dates. Years of the Julian Period are counted from this year, 4713 BC, which was chosen to be before any historical record.&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 591-592.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since it is now certain that every possible combination of the three cyclic numbers finds its place in the Julian Period, it is evident that the first year of the Christian era, which was the 10th year of a Solar Cycle, the 2nd of a Lunar Cycle, and the 4th of a Cycle of Indiction, finds its place within this artificial era, and must answer to that particular year of the period which is characterized by the same cyclic numbers.   Hence, to refer the Christian era to the Julian Period is the same thing as to find out what year of that period it is which, when divided by 28 will leave a remainder 10, divided by 19 will leave a remainder 2, and divided by 15 will leave a remainder 4.   The solution of this problem belongs to the higher mathematics, by which it is found that the year required is the 4714th of the period in question.   Hence Jul. Per. 4714=A.D.1, and consequently Julian Period 4713=B.C.1.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Smith &amp; ben Uziel 1853, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In point of fact, finding the year is a very straightforward arithmetical  procedure.   See "Calculation" below.

Although many references say that the ''Julian'' in "Julian Period" refers to Scaliger's father, [[Julius Caesar Scaliger|Julius Scaliger]], in the introduction to Book V of his ''{{lang|la|Opus de Emendatione Temporum}}'' ("Work on the Emendation of Time") he states, "''{{lang|la|Iulianam vocauimus: quia ad annum Iulianum dumtaxat accomodata est}}''", which translates more or less as "We have called it Julian merely because it is accommodated to the Julian year." Thus ''Julian'' refers to [[Julius Caesar]], who introduced the Julian calendar in 46 BC.

Originally the Julian Period was used only to count years, and the Julian calendar was used to express historical dates within years.  In his book ''Outlines of Astronomy'', first published in 1849, the astronomer [[John Herschel]] added the counting of days elapsed from the beginning of the Julian Period:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The period thus arising of 7980 Julian years, is called the Julian period, and it has been found so useful, that the most competent authorities have not hesitated to declare that, through its employment, light and order were first introduced into chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Ideler 1825, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;   We owe its invention or revival to Joseph Scaliger, who is said to have received it from the Greeks of Constantinople. The first year of the current Julian period, or that of which the number in each of the three subordinate cycles is 1, was the year 4713 BC, and the noon of the 1st of January of that year, for the meridian of Alexandria, is the chronological epoch, to which all historical eras are most readily and intelligibly referred, by computing the number of integer days intervening between that epoch and the noon (for Alexandria) of the day, which is reckoned to be the first of the particular era in question. The meridian of Alexandria is chosen as that to which Ptolemy refers the commencement of the era of Nabonassar, the basis of all his calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Herschel 1858, p. 678&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Astronomer]]s adopted Herschel's "days of the Julian period" in the late nineteenth century, but used the meridian of Greenwich instead of Alexandria, after the former was adopted as the [[Prime Meridian]] after the [[International Meridian Conference]] in Washington in 1884. This has now become the standard system of Julian days numbers.

The French mathematician and astronomer [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] first expressed the time of day as a decimal fraction added to calendar dates in his book, ''{{lang|fr|Traité de Mécanique Céleste}}'', in 1799.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QjEVAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA348 Laplace] 1799, p.349&lt;/ref&gt; Other astronomers added fractions of the day to the Julian day number to create Julian Dates, which are typically used by astronomers to date [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations, thus eliminating the complications resulting from using standard calendar periods like eras, years, or months. They were first introduced into [[variable star]] work by [[Edward Charles Pickering]], of the [[Harvard College Observatory]], in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5jQJAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=toc#PPA206,M1 Furness] 1988, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian days begin at noon because when Herschel recommended them, the [[astronomical day]] began at noon. The astronomical day had begun at noon ever since [[Ptolemy]] chose to begin the days in his astronomical periods at noon. He chose noon because the transit of the Sun across the observer's meridian occurs at the same apparent time every day of the year, unlike sunrise or sunset, which vary by several hours. Midnight was not even considered because it could not be accurately determined using [[water clock]]s. Nevertheless, he double-dated most nighttime observations with both [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] days beginning at sunrise and [[Babylonia]]n days beginning at sunset. This would seem to imply that his choice of noon was ''not'', as is sometimes stated, made in order to allow all observations from a given night to be recorded with the same date. When this practice ended in 1925, it was decided to keep Julian days continuous with previous practice.

== Julian day number calculation ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gregorian calendar]] --&gt;
The Julian day number can be calculated using the following formulas ('''[[integer division]] is used exclusively''', that is, the remainders of all divisions are '''dropped'''):

''The months January to December are numbered 1 to 12. For the year, [[astronomical year numbering]] is used, thus 1 BC is 0, 2 BC is −1, and 4713 BC is −4712. ''JDN'' is the Julian Day Number. Use the previous day of the month if trying to find the JDN of an instant before midday UT.''

===Converting Gregorian calendar date to Julian Day Number===
The algorithm&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, Ch. 12, "Calendars", p. 604, in Seidelmann 1992&lt;/ref&gt; is valid for all (possibly [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar|proleptic]]) Gregorian calendar dates after November 23, &amp;minus;4713.

JDN = (1461 × (Y + 4800 + (M − 14)/12))/4 +(367 × (M − 2 − 12 × ((M − 14)/12)))/12 − (3 × ((Y + 4900 + (M - 14)/12)/100))/4 + D − 32075

===Converting Julian calendar date to Julian Day Number===
The algorithm&lt;ref&gt;L. E. Doggett, Ch. 12, "Calendars", p. 606, in Seidelmann 1992&lt;/ref&gt; is valid for all (possibly [[Proleptic Julian calendar|proleptic]]) Julian calendar years ≥ −4712, that is, for all JDN ≥ 0.

JDN = 367 × Y − (7 × (Y + 5001 + (M − 9)/7))/4 + (275 × M)/9 + D + 1729777

=== Finding Julian date given Julian day number and time of day ===
For the full Julian Date of a moment after 12:00 UT one can use the following (divisions are real numbers):

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}J\!D &amp; = &amp; J\!D\!N + \frac{\text{hour} - 12}{24} + \frac{\text{minute}}{1440} + \frac{\text{second}}{86400}\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

So, for example, January 1, 2000, at 18:00:00 UT corresponds to ''JD'' = 2451545.25

For a point in time in a given Julian day after midnight UT and before 12:00 UT, add 1 or use the JDN of the next afternoon.

=== Finding day of week given Julian day number ===
The US day of the [[week]] '''W1''' (for an afternoon or evening UT) can be determined from the Julian Day Number '''J''' with the expression:
: '''W1''' = [[Modular arithmetic|mod]](''J'' + 1, 7)&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, pp. 592, 618.&lt;/ref&gt;

{|border="1" class="wikitable"
|-style="text-align:center;"
!'''W1'''
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6
|-
!'''Day of the week'''
|Sun||Mon||Tue||Wed||Thu||Fri||Sat
|}

If the moment in time is after midnight UT (and before 12:00 UT), then one is already in the next day of the week.

The ISO day of the week '''W0''' can be determined from the Julian Day Number '''J''' with the expression:
: '''W0''' = mod (''J'', 7) + 1

{|border="1" class="wikitable"

|Mon||Tue||Wed||Thu||Fri||Sat||Sun
|}

=== Julian or Gregorian calendar from Julian day number ===
This is an algorithm by Richards to convert a Julian Day Number, '''J''',  to a date in the Gregorian calendar (proleptic, when applicable). Richards states the algorithm is valid for Julian day numbers greater than or equal to 0.&lt;ref&gt;Richards 2013, 617–9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards 1998, 316&lt;/ref&gt; All variables are integer values, and the notation "''a''&amp;nbsp;div&amp;nbsp;''b''" indicates [[integer division]], and "mod(''a'',''b'')" denotes the [[Modular arithmetic|modulus operator]].

For Julian calendar:
:1. ''f'' =  '''J''' + ''j''
For Gregorian calendar:
:1. ''f'' =  '''J''' + ''j'' + (((4 × '''J''' + ''B'') div 146097) × 3) div 4 + ''C''
For Julian or Gregorian, continue:
:2. ''e'' = ''r'' × ''f'' + ''v''
:3. ''g'' = mod(''e'', ''p'') div ''r''
:4. ''h'' = ''u'' × ''g'' + ''w''
:5. '''D''' = (mod(''h, s'')) div ''u'' + 1
:6. '''M''' = mod(''h'' div ''s'' + ''m'', ''n'') + 1
:7. '''Y''' = (''e'' div ''p'') - ''y'' + (''n'' + ''m'' - '''M''') div ''n''

'''D''', '''M''', and '''Y''' are the numbers of the day, month, and year respectively for the afternoon at the beginning of the given Julian day.

=== Julian Period from indiction, Metonic and solar cycles ===

Let Y be the year BC or AD and i, m and s respectively its positions in the indiction, Metonic and solar cycles.
Divide 6916i + 4200m + 4845s by 7980 and call the remainder r.
:If r&gt;4713, Y = (r − 4713) and is a year AD.
:If r&lt;4714, Y = (4714 − r) and is a year BC.

'''Example'''

i = 8, m = 2, s = 8.   What is the year?

:(6916 × 8) = 55328; (4200 × 2) = 8400: (4845 × 8) = 38760.   55328 + 8400 + 38760 = 102488.
:102488/7980 = 12 remainder 6728.
:Y = (6728 − 4713) = AD 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Heath 1760, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Julian date calculation==
As stated above, the Julian date (JD) of any instant is the Julian day number for the preceding noon in Universal Time plus the fraction of the day since that instant. Ordinarily calculating the fractional portion of the JD is straightforward; the number of seconds that have elapsed in the day divided by the number of seconds in a day, 86,400. But if the UTC timescale is being used, a day containing a positive leap second contains 86,401 seconds (or in the unlikely event of a negative leap second, 86,399 seconds). One authoritative source, the [[SOFA (astronomy)|Standards of Fundamental Astronomy]] (SOFA), deals with this issue by treating days containing a leap second as having a different length (86,401 or 86,399 seconds, as required). SOFA refers to the result of such a calculation as "quasi-JD".&lt;ref&gt;"SOFA Time Scale and Calendar Tools" 2016, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karun Treasure''' is the name given to a collection of 363 valuable [[Lydia]]n artifacts dating from the 7th century BC and originating from [[Uşak Province]] in western Turkey, which were the subject of a [[legal battle]] between [[Turkey]] and [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]] between 1987–1993 and which were returned to Turkey in 1993 after the Museum admitted it had known the objects were stolen when they had purchased them. The collection is alternatively known as the ''Lydian Hoard''. The items are exhibited in the [[Uşak Museum of Archaeology]].

The collection made sensational news once again in May 2006 when a key piece, a golden [[hippocamp]], on display in [[Uşak]] Museum along with the rest of the collection, was discovered to have been switched with a [[counterfeit|fake]], probably between March and August 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5027074.stm | title = Croesus riches replaced by fakes|author=|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]| accessdate=2006-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yet another term used for the collection is "Croesus Treasure". Although the artifacts were closely contemporary to [[Croesus]], whether they should be directly associated with the legendary Lydian king or not remains debatable. Croesus' wealth had repercussions on a number of [[Asia]]n cultures in a vein similar to his fame in the western cultures, and is referred to either as ''Qarun'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]) or Karun ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]), or [[Korah]], with the mythical proportions of his fortune also echoed in various ways, parallel to the [[English language]] expression "as rich as Croesus".&lt;ref&gt;Qarun and reference to his wealth mentioned in the [[Koran]] (''[28:76] to [28:82]''). In [[Persian mythology]], to which the other citations could be connected, the ''Qârun Treasure'' is a treasure said to be in perpetual motion under the ground. The phrase ''harta karun'' (literally Croesus' Wealth) also worked into the Malay language as the word for ''treasure'' and is synonymous with the term ''buried treasure''. ''Ganj-e-Qarun'' (Croesus Treasure) was also an [[Iran]]ian movie made in 1965 by [[Siamak Yasami]] and widely regarded as one of the classics of [[Iranian cinema]]. The movie recounts the story of a very wealthy man who attempts suicide and then finds happiness in the simplicity of a pauper's home.&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why the term "Karun Treasure" took hold, and in any case, the king Croesus' Treasure consisted of more than 363 pieces and the tomb chamber [[tumulus]] where most artifacts were discovered (they originate from close but different sites) was that of a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serfed.com/dergi/10/15-ANADOLU_UYGARLIKLARI.pdf|title=The rich kings of the thousand hills, Lydians|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.serfed.com|publisher=Turkish Ceramic Federation|author=Nezih Başgelen|accessdate=2005-07-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122153206/http://www.serfed.com/dergi/10/15-ANADOLU_UYGARLIKLARI.pdf|archivedate=January 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and smuggling==
The main and the most precious part of the treasure comes from a tomb chamber of a Lydian princess reached through illegal excavations carried out by three fortune-seekers from Uşak's depending Güre village, at the proximity of which the tomb was located, at the locality called Toptepe. After having dug for days and unable to break through the marble masonry of the chamber door, they had [[dynamite]]d the roof of the tomb in the night of 6 June 1966, to be the first to see the breathtaking sight of the buried Lydian noblewoman and her treasures after 2600 years. The treasure looted from this particular tomb was enriched by further finds by the same men in other [[tumuli]] of the locality during 1966-1967. The collection was smuggled outside Turkey in separate dispatches through [[İzmir]] and [[Amsterdam]], to be bought by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] between 1967–1968, at an invoiced cost of $1.2 million for 200 of the pieces within the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tayproject.org/Haber.fm$Retrieve?ID=1267&amp;html=haber_detail_tu.html&amp;layout=web|title=Uşak-New York|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.tayproject.org|publisher=TAY Project|language=Turkish|author=|accessdate=2001-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal battle==

The efforts made by successive Turkish governments to retrieve the collection were incited since the very beginning and followed until conclusion by the journalist [[Özgen Acar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_04/uk/doss27.htm |title=We have to change the buyer's attitude |author=Michel Bessières |publisher=[[UNESCO]] Courrier |accessdate=2001-04-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010723161923/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_04/uk/doss27.htm |archivedate=2001-07-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acar had chanced upon some pieces of the collection for the first time in 1984 in a Met Museum [[Collection catalog|catalogue]] and had informed Turkey's [[Culture and Tourism Ministry of Turkey|Ministry of Culture]] of their clear provenance, while he also wrote several articles and pursued the bureaucratic channels within Turkey with insistence throughout the affair. He acted as a voluntary envoy of the Ministry within the frame of the judicial case launched in [[New York City]] in 1987 and brought to conclusion in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herrick.com/Upload/Publication/Articles/ArticleHF_0208.pdf|title=The Art Theft Experts|author=Thomas Adcock|publisher=[[New York Law Journal]]|accessdate=2006-02-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031010110/http://www.herrick.com/Upload/Publication/Articles/ArticleHF_0208.pdf|archivedate=2006-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time as he was named [[consultant]] in the larger framework of the Turkey's participation in the work carried out by [[UNIDROIT]] regarding the protection of historic, cultural and religious heritage. Acar's name is also synonymous in Turkey for the retrieval of another set of smuggled archaeological goods, termed "Elmalı Treasure" in reference to their site of origin, the town of [[Elmalı]] in southwestern Turkey, and involving this time [[Lydia]]n coins and extremely rare [[drachma|decadrachms]] dating from the period of the [[Delian League]], with the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] as his opposite party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-security.org/reports/003199.html#8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000823041626/http://museum-security.org/reports/003199.html#8|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-23|title=Elmalı treasure|author=|publisher=Museum Security|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uşak Museum case==
The clear need for a museum worthy of the treasure was being voiced ever since the artifacts had returned to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldpress.org/Europe/1491.cfm | title = Croesus: The poverty of treasure|author=[[Özgen Acar]]|publisher=[[Cumhuriyet]]| accessdate=2003-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the seizure by the authorities of ten other illegally excavated artifacts in 1998, further archaeological discoveries and the known presence of eight gold pieces that had appeared in 2000 during an exhibition in a [[Paris]] private gallery for which attempts for retrieval were yet to be made, a handsome collection of base consisting of a total of 375 pieces was already accumulated. But the small museum in [[Uşak]] where the collection was placed, more focused on storage of [[Ushak carpet]]s and operating under conditions of budgetary and staff restraints,&lt;ref&gt;The number of experts working in Turkish museums halved from 1,500 to 750 in the last ten years. {{cite web|url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=48792|title=Croesus: Ten people charged in Croesus theft case|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Turkish Daily News]]|author=|accessdate=2003-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717031211/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=48792|archivedate=2006-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not fully meet the requirements for the preservation of Karun Treasure. Doubts about the site's suitability were reinforced by the filing of currently unresolved legal action against museum staff regarding the 2007 theft. The museum's former director remains the only person to be still kept in [[police custody|custody]] among the ten initially accused in the frame of the case around the hippocamp's replacement with a fake.

==Curse of the treasure==
Some{{who|date=December 2013}} in Uşak and beyond associate the treasure with a [[curse]]. Legend has it that the seven men who took part in the illegal digs "died violent deaths or suffered great misfortune".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey|title= King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey |work=The Guardian|author=Constanze Letsch|date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kintech Lab''' is a software company headquartered in Russia. It provides [[Application software|computer simulation software]] in the areas of [[combustion]], [[energy sources]], [[photonics]], [[microelectronics]], [[nanotechnology]]. Also Kintech Lab is the [[R &amp; D]] company performing [[Scientific method|scientific]] research projects in the above-mentioned areas. &lt;br&gt;
Kintech Lab was established in 1998 by a group of scientists lead by Potapkin Boris from [[Kurchatov Institute|RSC Kurchatov Institute]].

==History==

The company was founded in 1998 by a group of scientists lead by Potapkin Boris from Institute of Hydrogen Energy and Plasma Technology at [[Kurchatov Institute|RSC Kurchatov Institute]].

==Mission statement==
Traditional approach to the creation of new materials and technologies which is based on the sequential [[prototype]] creation and introducing modifications after prototype testing requires large time and financial expenses. In the frame of this approach simulation in many cases is used just for description of the obtained experimental data and [[extrapolation]] of these data using particular model [[approximation]]. In this case the understanding of the detailed mechanism on the atomic level is not necessary. This fact does not allow utilizing the great amount of information on the properties of materials and processes which is obtained by the fundamental scientific researches.

Progress in theoretical methods, development of efficient computational [[algorithms]], continuous exponential growth of computer resources and recent advances in massively [[parallel computing]], make it possible to apply the alternative approach. This approach implies an [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] [[simulation]] of the materials and processes based on the detailed understanding of structure and mechanism on the atomic level. In the frame of this approach simulation precedes the prototype creation allowing to significantly decreasing of the amount of the experimental tests and hence to decrease the development cost and time and to decrease innovation risks.
This is why the Kintech Lab’s main activity is the development of methods, algorithms and corresponding software for the predictive [[multiscale modeling]] of the properties of materials, processes and devices based on the [[Ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]] calculations, [[computer modeling]] and fundamental experimental data.

== Products ==
* [[Chemical WorkBench]] - a software for the development and reduction of kinetic mechanisms
* [[Khimera]] - a software for the first principles-based calculation of microscopic parameters of physico-chemical processes
* MD-kMC - a software for simulating [[atom]]istic processes using [[molecular mechanics]] and kinetic [[Monte-Carlo simulation|Monte-Carlo methods]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5126">The '''Laplace plane''' or '''Laplacian plane''' of a planetary satellite, named after its discoverer [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827), is a mean or reference plane about whose axis the instantaneous [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] of a [[satellite]] [[precession|precesses]].  

Laplace's name is sometimes applied to the [[invariable plane]], which is the plane perpendicular to a system's mean angular momentum vector, but the two should not be confused.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Tremaine]], Jihad Touma, and Fathi Namouni (2009). [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AJ....137.3706T "Satellite dynamics on the Laplace surface"], ''[[The Astronomical Journal]]'' '''137''', 3706–3717.&lt;/ref&gt;  They are equivalent only in the case where all [[Perturbation theory|perturbers]] and [[Orbital resonance|resonances]] are far from the precessing body.

==Definition==
The axis of this Laplace plane is coplanar with, and between, (a) the polar axis of the parent planet's spin, and (b) the orbital axis of the parent planet's orbit around the Sun.&lt;ref name="ESAA92" /&gt; The Laplace plane arises because the equatorial oblateness of the parent planet tends to cause the orbit of the satellite to precess around the polar axis of the parent planet's equatorial plane, while the solar perturbations tend to cause the orbit of the satellite to precess around the polar axis of the parent planet's orbital plane around the Sun.  The two effects acting together result in an intermediate position for the reference axis for the satellite orbit's precession.

==Explanation==
In effect, this is the plane normal to the orbital precession pole of the satellite. It is a kind of "average orbital plane" of the satellite, around which the instantaneous orbital plane of the satellite [[Precession|precesses]], and to which it has a constant additional inclination.&lt;ref name="ESAA92"&gt;See P. Kenneth Seidelmann (ed.) (1992),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=uJ4JhGJANb4C&amp;pg=PA327#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac''], University Science Books, Sausalito (Ca), pages 327-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases, the Laplace plane is very close to the equatorial plane of its primary planet (if the satellite is very close to its planet) or to the plane of the primary planet's orbit around the Sun (if the satellite is far away from its planet).  This is because the strength of the planet's perturbation on the satellite's orbit is much stronger for orbits close to the planet, but drops below the strength of the Sun's perturbation for orbits farther away.  Examples of satellites whose Laplace plane is close to their planet's equatorial plane include the [[Moons of Mars|satellites of Mars]] and the [[Inner moon|inner satellites of the giant planets]].  Examples of satellites whose Laplace plane is close to their planet's orbital plane include Earth's [[Moon]] and the [[Irregular moon|outer satellites of the giant planets]].  Some satellites, such as Saturn's [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], are situated in the transitional zone and have Laplace planes that are midway between their planet's equatorial plane and the plane of its solar orbit.  

So the varying positions of the Laplace plane at varying distances from the primary planet can be pictured as putting together a warped or non-planar surface, which may be pictured as a series of concentric rings whose orientation in space is variable: the innermost rings are near the equatorial [[plane of rotation]] and oblateness of the planet, and the outermost rings near its solar orbital plane.  Also, in some cases, larger satellites of a planet (such as Neptune's [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]) can affect the Laplace planes of smaller satellites orbiting the same planet.

==The work of Laplace==
The Laplace or Laplacean plane, as discussed here, relates to the orbit of a planetary satellite. It is to be distinguished from another and quite different plane, also discovered by Laplace, and which is also sometimes called the "Laplacian" or "Laplace plane", but more often the [[invariable plane]] (or the "invariable plane of Laplace").  The invariable plane is simply derived from the sum of angular momenta, and is "invariable" over the entire system, while the Laplace plane may be different for different orbiting objects within a system.  Confusingly, a satellite's Laplace plane (as defined here) is also sometimes called its "invariable plane". 

The Laplace plane is a result of perturbational effects, which were discovered by Laplace while he was investigating the orbits of Jupiter’s principal moons (the [[Galilean satellites]] of Jupiter).  Laplace found that the effects of the solar perturbing force, and of the planet’s oblateness (its equatorial bulge), together gave rise to an "inclinaison propre", an "own inclination",  in the plane of the satellite orbits, relative to the plane of Jupiter’s equator.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1805), ''Mécanique céleste'', Volume 4, Book 8, Courcier, Paris, 1805.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mail art''' (also known as '''postal art''' and '''correspondence art''') is a populist artistic movement centered on sending small scale works through the [[mail|postal service]].  It initially developed out of what eventually became [[Ray Johnson]]'s New York Correspondence School in the 1950s and the [[Fluxus]] movement in the 1960s, though it has since developed into a global movement that continues to the present.

==Characteristics==

Media commonly used in mail art include postcards, paper, a collage of found or recycled images and objects, rubber stamps, artist-created stamps (called [[artistamps]]), and paint, but can also include music, sound art, poetry, or anything that can be put in an envelope and sent via post.  Mail art is considered art once it is dispatched.  Mail artists regularly call for thematic or topical mail art for use in (often [[unjuried]]) exhibition.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref name=UB&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/LIB-PC001|work=Digital Collections, UB Libraries|publisher=University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail artists appreciate interconnection with other artists.  The artform promotes an egalitarian way of creating that frequently circumvents official art distribution and approval systems such as the art market, museums, and galleries.  Mail artists rely on their alternative "outsider" network as the primary way of sharing their work, rather than being dependent on the ability to locate and secure exhibition space.&lt;ref name=Oberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art @ Oberlin|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|work=Oberlin College Art Library|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403130316/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|archivedate=3 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KostelanetzBrittain2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Kostelanetz|author2=H.

Mail art can be seen as anticipating the cyber communities founded on the Internet.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;

==History==

[[File:RayJohnson invite1970.jpg|right|thumb|Ray Johnson's invitation to the first mail art show, 1970]]
Artist Edward M. Plunkett has argued that communication-as-art-form is an ancient tradition; he posits (tongue in cheek) that mail art began when Cleopatra had herself delivered to Julius Caesar in a rolled-up carpet.&lt;ref name=Plunkett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Edward M.|title=The New York Correspondence School|journal=Art Journal|year=1977|issue=Spring|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Plunkett.html|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ray Johnson, the New York Correspondance School, and Fluxus===
The American artist [[Ray Johnson]] is considered to be the first mail artist.&lt;ref name=MOCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=22|work=Collection: MOCA's First Thirty Years|publisher=MOCA: The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillpot&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillpot|first=Clive|title=Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology|year=1995|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Canada|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Phillpot.html|editor=Chuck Welch|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's experiments with art in the mail began in 1943, while the posting of instructions and soliciting of activity from his recipients began in the mid-1950s with the mailing of his "moticos", and thus provided mail art with a blueprint for the free exchange of art via post.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Vincitorio, "Informalista o videoartista? Le tendenze artistiche dagli anni '40 ad oggi", L'Espresso n.44, 7 November 1982{{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "mail art" was coined in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; In 1962, Plunkett coined the term "New York Correspondence School" to refer to Johnson's activities; Johnson adopted this moniker but sometimes intentionally misspelled it as "correspondance."&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; The deliberate misspelling was characteristic of the playful spirit of the Correspondance School and its actions.&lt;ref name=Danto&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danto|first=Arthur C.|journal=The Nation|date=March 29, 1999|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/correspondance-school-art#|title=Correspondance School Art|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Correspondance School members are fairly obscure, and the letters they sent, often featuring simple drawings or stickers, often instructed the recipient to perform some fairly simple action. Johnson's work consists primarily of letters, often with the addition of doodles and rubber stamped messages, which he mailed to friends and acquaintances. The Correspondance School was a network of individuals who were artists by virtue of their willingness to play along and appreciate Johnson's sense of humor.  One example of the activities of the Correspondance School consisted in calling meetings of fan clubs, such as one devoted to the actress [[Anna May Wong]].  Many of Johnson's missives to his network featured a hand drawn version of what became a personal logo or alter-ego, a bunny head.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;

In a 1968 interview, Johnson explained that he found mailed correspondence interesting because of the limits it puts on the usual back and forth interaction and negotiation that comprises communication between individuals.  Correspondence is  "a way to convey a message or a kind of idea to someone which is not verbal; it is not a confrontation of two people. It's an object which is opened in privacy, probably, and the message is looked at&amp;nbsp;... You look at the object and, depending on your degree of interest, it very directly gets across to you what is there&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=AAAOH&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral history interview with Ray Johnson, 1968 Apr. 17|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-ray-johnson-13236|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Johnson and Marcia Tucker organized The New York Correspondence School Exhibition at the [[Whitney Museum]] in New York, which was the first significant public exhibition of the mail art genre.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;

On April 5, 1973, Johnson declared the "death" of the New York Correspondance School in an unpublished letter to the Obituary Department of ''The New York Times'' and in copies that he circulated to his network.   However, he continued to practice mail art even after this.&lt;ref name=AAALippardLetter&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson mail art to Lucy R. Lippard, 1965 June 29|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/ray-johnson-mail-art-to-lucy-r-lippard-13544|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RJEstate-bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson Biography|url=http://www.rayjohnsonestate.com/biography/|publisher=Ray Johnson Estate|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much of Johnson's work was initially given away, this hasn't prevented it from attaining a market value. [[Andy Warhol]] is quoted as saying he would pay ten dollars for anything by Johnson."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Home, ''The Assault On Culture'', Aporia Press &amp; Unpopular Books, London 1988 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1973 diagram showing the development and scope of [[Fluxus]], [[George Maciunas]] included mail art among the activities pursued by the Fluxus artist [[Robert Filliou]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Jon (1988). ''Fluxus Codex'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, pp 329–333. {{ISBN|978-0-8109-0920-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filliou coined the term the "Eternal Network" that has become synonymous with mail art.&lt;ref name=Bloch&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Mark|title=Amazing Letters: The Life and Art of David Zack|url=http://www.panmodern.com/zack-article.html|editor=Istvan Kantor|accessdate=11 April 2013|chapter=An Authentik and Historikal Discourse On the Phenomenon of David Zack, Mail Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Fluxus artists have been involved since the early 1960s in the creation of artist's postage stamps (Robert Watts, Stamp Dispenser, 1963), postcards (Ben Vautier, The Postman's Choice, 1965: a postcard with a different address on each side) and other works connected to the postal medium.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} "Indeed, the mail art network counts many Fluxus members among its earliest participants.  While Johnson did not consider himself directly as a member of the Fluxus school, his interests and attitudes were consistent with those of a number of Fluxus artists.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAOH /&gt;

===1970s and 1980s===
In the 1970s, the practice of mail art grew considerably, providing a cheap and flexible channel of expression for cultural outsiders.  It was particularly widespread where state censorship prevented a free circulation of alternative ideas, as in certain countries behind the Iron Curtain or in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=East/West: Mail Art &amp; Censorship|journal=PostHype|year=1985|volume=4|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of a sizable mail art community, with friendships born out of personal correspondence and, increasingly, mutual visits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Ginny|title=The Mail Art Community in Europe|journal=Umbrella Magazine|year=1981|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; led in the 1980s to the organization of several festivals, meetings and conventions where networkers could meet, socialize, perform, exhibit and plan further collaborations.  Among these events were the Inter Dada Festivals organized in California in the early 1980s&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Janice|title=A gleefully rebellious festival of dada|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__IZN7YDU3d4/S_aip9CJ4WI/AAAAAAAAAmU/gS467sN7lZQ/s1600/reibunedada.jpg|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=August 26, 1984|location=Art: The Tribune Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decentralized Mail Art Congress of 1986.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans-Reudi Fricker|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|work=Mail Art @ Oberlin|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903031741/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|archivedate=3 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 curator Ronny Cohen organized an exhibition for the [[Franklin Furnace]], New York, called "Mail Art Then and Now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art From 1984 Franklin Furnace Exhibition|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/research/projects/flow/mailart/mailartf.html|publisher=Franklin Furnace|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was to have an historical aspect as well as showing new mail art, and to mediate the two aspects Cohen edited the material sent to Franklin Furnace, breaking an unwritten but commonly accepted custom that all works submitted must be shown. The intent to edit, interpreted as censorship, resulted in a two-part panel discussion sponsored by Artists Talk on Art (organized by mail artist Carlo Pittore and moderated by art critic [[Robert C. Morgan]]) in February of that year, where Cohen and the mail artists were to debate the issues.

The night preceding the second panel on February 24, [[Carlo Pittore]], John P. Jacob, Chuck Welch a.k.a. CrackerJack Kid, David Cole and John Held, Jr. crafted a statement asking Dr. Cohen to step down as the panel moderator. Welch delivered the statement whereby Dr. Cohen was asked to remain on the panel but forfeit her right to serve as moderator. Instead of remaining, Cohen chose to leave the event. After some give and take with both panelists and audience, Dr. Cohen left, saying, "Have fun boys." Her entourage walked out with her during the ensuing melee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International MailArt--Part II: The New Cultural Strategy|last=Heisler|first=Faith|year=1984|issue=4|volume=9|page=18|journal=Women Artists News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The excluded works were ultimately added to the exhibition by the staff of the Franklin Furnace, but the events surrounding it and the panels revealed ideological rifts within the mail art community. Simultaneously fanning the flames and documenting the extent to which it was already dominated by a small, mostly male, coterie of artists, the discussions were transcribed and published by panelist [[John P. Jacob]] in his short-lived mail art [[zine]] [[PostHype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=Mailart: A Partial Anatomy|journal=PostHype|year=1984|volume=3|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to panelist [[Mark Bloch]], [[Ray Johnson]] (who was not a panelist) commented on the reverse-censorship and sexism of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Bloch|title=Ray Johnson's letter to me after the event, questioning the issue of sexism.|url=http://www.panmodern.com/ray-atoa-letter.jpg|publisher=panmodern.com|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of mail art meetings and congresses during the late 80s, and the articulation of various "isms" proclaimed by their founders as movements within mail art, were in part a response to fractures made visible by the events surrounding the Franklin Furnace exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=The Coffee Table Book of Mail Art: The Intimate Letters of J.P. Jacob, 1981 - 1987|year=1987|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York|url=http://arcade.nyarc.org:80/record=b569546~S8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if "tourism" was proposed satirically as a new movement by H.R. Fricker, a Swiss mail artist who was one of the organizers of the 1986 Mail Art Congress, nevertheless mail art in its pure form would continue to function without the personal meeting between so-called networkers.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin /&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Fricker and Bloch, in a bilingual "Open Letter To Everybody in the Network" &lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Mark and Fricker, Hans Ruedi."Phantastische Gebete Revisited" in Panmag International Magazine 6, ISSN 0738-4777, February 1984. pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; stated, "1) An important function of he exhibitions and other group projects in the network is: to open channels to other human beings. 2) After your exhibition is shown and the documentation sent, or after you have received such a documentation with a list of addresses, ''use the channels''! 3) Create person-to-person correspondence... 4) You have your own unique energy which you can give to others through your work: visual audio, verbal, etc.  5) This energy is best used when it is exchanged for energy from another person with the same intentions. 6) the power of the network is in the quality of the direct correspondence, not the quantity." The manifesto concludes, "We have learned this from our own mistakes." &lt;ref&gt;Röder, Kornelia "H. R. Fricker, Mail Art and Social Networks," HR Fricker: Conquer the Living Rooms of the World, Kunstmuseum Thurgau, Warth, Switzerland: Edition Fink, 2014, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s and the impact of the Internet era===
[[File:Paulo bruscky and david horvitz.JPG|thumb|American mail-artist [[David Horvitz]] (active since the 2000s) meets Brazilian mail artist Paulo Bruscky (active since the 1970s) in Berlin, Germany in November 2015.]]

In 1994, Dutch mail artist [[Ruud Janssen]] began a series of [[mail-interviews]] which became an influential contribution in the field of mail art.&lt;ref&gt;
Ruud Janssen, ''Mail-Interviews'', Tilburg 1994–2001
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, mail art's peak in terms of global postal activities had been reached, and mail artists, aware of increasing postal rates, were beginning the gradual migration of collective art projects towards the web and new, cheaper forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Bleus]] (Ed.), ''Re: The E-Mail-Art &amp; Internet-Art Manifesto'', in: ''E-Pêle-Mêle: Electronic Mail-Art Netzine'', Vol.III, n° 1, T.A.C.-42.292, Hasselt, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet facilitated faster dissemination of mail art calls (invitations) and precipitated the involvement of a large number of newcomers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Mail art blogs and websites became ever more frequently used to display contributions and online documentation,{{original research inline|date=January 2013}} even if many{{who|date=January 2013}} mail artists still preferred the surprise of a catalogue found in their mailbox.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}}

==Philosophy and norms of the mail artist network==
In spite of the many links and similarities between historical avant-garde, alternative art practices ([[visual poetry]], [[Xerox art|copy art]], [[artist's book]]s) and mail art, one aspect that distinguishes the creative postal network from other artistic movements, schools or groups (including Fluxus) is the way it disregards and circumvents for the commercial art market.&lt;ref name=Spark&gt;{{cite web|title=About John Held Jr. in the Spark episode "The Fine Art of Collecting"|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=4489|work=Spark|publisher=KQED|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any person with access to a mailbox can participate in the postal network and exchange free artworks, and each mail artist is free to decide how and when to answer (or not answer) a piece of incoming mail. Participants are invited by network members to take part in collective projects or unjuried exhibitions in which entries are not selected or judged.  While contributions may be solicited around a particular theme, work to a required size, or sent in by a deadline, mail art generally operates within a spirit of "anything goes."&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt;

The mail art philosophy of openness and inclusion is exemplified by the "rules" included in invitations (calls) to postal projects: a mail art show has no jury, no entry fee, there is no censorship, and all works are exhibited.&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt; The original contributions are not to be returned and remain the property of the organizers, but a catalogue or documentation is sent free to all the participants in exchange for their works. Although these rules are sometimes stretched, they have generally held up for four decades, with only minor dissimilarities and adjustments, like the occasional requests to avoid works of explicit sexual nature, calls for projects with specific participants, or the recent trend to display digital documentation on blogs and websites instead of personally sending printed paper to contributors.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:BananaPost'89 AnnaBanana.jpg|right|thumb|BananaPost '89 artistamps by Anna Banana, 1989]]
Mail art has been exhibited in alternative spaces such as private apartments, municipal buildings, and shop windows, as well as in galleries and museums worldwide.&lt;ref name=Oberlin /&gt;   Mail art shows, periodicals, and projects represent the "public" side of postal networking, a practice that has at its core the direct and private interaction between the individual participants. Mail artists value the process of exchanging ideas and the sense of belonging to a global community that is able to maintain a peaceful collaboration beyond differences of language, religion and ideology; this is one aspect that differentiates the mail art network from the world of commercial picture postcards and of simply "mailed art."&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology"&gt;Welch, C. (1995). ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/231651233 Eternal network: A mail art anthology]''. Calgary, Alta: Univ. of Calgary Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mail artist may have hundreds of correspondents from many different countries, or build a smaller core circle of favorite contacts. Mail art is widely practiced in Europe, North and South America, Russia, Australia and Japan, with smaller numbers of participants also in Africa, and China.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  In addition to being kept by the recipient, mail art archives have attracted the interest of libraries, archives, museums, and private collectors.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;  Or, the works may be 'worked into' and recycled back to the sender or to another networker.

[[File:Envelope HRFricker(1990).jpg|right|thumb|Mail art envelope from H.R. Fricker, 1990]]
Ray Johnson suggested (with a pun) that "mail art has no history, only a present", and mail artists have followed his playful attitude in creating their own mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43915838|title=Ray Johnson : correspondences|last=M.|first=De Salvo, Donna|last2=Catherine.|first2=Gudis,|date=1999|publisher=Wexner Center for the Arts|year=|isbn=2080136631|location=|pages=81|oclc=43915838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parody art movements like [[neoism]] and plagiarism have challenged notions of originality, as have the shared pseudonymous names [[Monty Cantsin]] and [[Karen Eliot]], which were proposed for serial use by anyone.&lt;ref name="Carr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. Carr|title=On Edge: Performance at the End of the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QX9ZSOWJO-gC&amp;pg=PA105|date=9 April 2012|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=978-0-8195-7242-4|pages=105–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Semi-fictional organizations have been set up and virtual lands invented, imaginary countries for which [[artistamps]] are issued.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, attempts have been made to document and define the history of a complex and underestimated phenomenon that has spanned five decades. Various essays, graduate theses, guides and anthologies of mail art writings have appeared in print and on the Internet, often written by veteran networkers.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;
A sub-group of envelope art has its genesis in the Grateful Dead Ticket Service. Looking to help their fans avoid  the high fees that are generated by national ticket services the Grateful Dead started their own service, commonly referred to as mail order. At some point fans started decorating their envelopes with art. Some for art's sake, others to grab the attention of the people that dole out tickets in hope of better seats.http://www.gdtstoo.com/

==Media and artistic practices in the creation of mail artworks==
{{see also|Postage stamp}}
Because the democratic ethos of mail art is one of inclusion, both in terms of participants ('anyone who can afford the postage') and in the scope of art forms, a broad range of media are employed in creation of mail artworks. Certain materials and techniques are commonly used and frequently favored by mail artists due to their availability, convenience, and ability to produce copies.

===Rubberstamps and artistamps===
[[File:Rubberstamps Klafki Pawson(1980s).jpg|right|thumb|Mail art rubber stamps by Jo Klafki (left) and Mark Pawson (right), 1980s]]
Mail art has adopted and appropriated several of graphic forms already associated with the postal system. The rubber stamp officially used for franking mail, already utilized by [[Dada]] and Fluxus artists, has been embraced by mail artists who, in addition to reusing ready-made rubber stamps, have them professionally made to their own designs. They also carve into erasers with linocut tools to create handmade ones. These unofficial rubber stamps, whether disseminating mail artists' messages or simply announcing the identity of the sender, help to transform regular postcards into artworks and make envelopes an important part of the mail art experience.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;

[[File:CarvedEraser ArtNahpro(c.1990).jpg|right|thumb|Carved eraser print by Paul Jackson, aka Art Nahpro, c. 1990]]
Mail art has also appropriated the postage stamp as a format for individual expression. Inspired by the example of Cinderella stamps and Fluxus faux-stamps, the [[artistamp]] has spawned a vibrant sub-network of artists dedicated to creating and exchanging their own stamps and stamp sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171811/http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |archivedate=2015-05-26 |df= }} Belgian Postal Service, Guy Bleus &amp; Jean Spiroux, ''Journée du Timbre: Mail-Art'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Jerry Dreva]] of the conceptual art group Les Petits Bonbons created a set of stamps and sent them to David Bowie who then used them as the inspiration for the cover of the single "Ashes to Ashes" released in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Roger|title=Scary Monsters|url=http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/scarymonsters.html|website=Bowie Golden Years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistamps and rubber stamps, have become important staples of mail artworks, particularly in the enhancement of postcards and envelopes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Frank, Peter, E.F. Higgins III, Rudolf Ungváry. "[http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/PFranke.html Postal Modernism: Artists' Stamps and Stamp Images]." ''World Art Post'', Artpool Archive, Museum of Fine Arts Budapest, April 1982 (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important anthology of rubberstamp art was published by the artist Hervé Fischer in his book ''Art and Marginal Communication'', Balland, Paris, 1974 - in French, English and German, to note also the catalog of the exhibition "Timbres d'artistes", Published of Musée de la Poste, Paris, 1993, organized by the french artist Jean-Noël Laszlo - in French, English.

===Envelopes===
Some mail artists lavish more attention on the envelopes than the contents within. Painted envelopes are one-of-a-kind artworks with the handwritten address becoming part of the work. Stitching, embossing and an array of drawing materials can all be found on postcards, envelopes and on the contents inside.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

===Printing and copying===
Printing is suited to mail artists who distribute their work widely. Various printmaking techniques, in addition to rubber stamping, are used to create multiples. Copy art (xerography, photocopy) is a common practice, with both mono and color copying being extensively used within the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Ubiquitous 'add &amp; pass' sheets that are designed to be circulated through the network with each artist adding and copying, chain-letter fashion, have also received some unfavorable criticism.{{according to whom|date=January 2013}} However, Xerography has been a key technology in the creation of many short-run periodicals and [[zines]] about mail art, and for the printed documentation that has been the traditional project culmination sent to participants. Inkjet and laserprint computer printouts are also used, both to disseminate artwork and for reproducing zines and documentation, and PDF copies of paperless periodicals and unprinted documentation are circulated by email. Photography is widely used as an art form, to provide images for artistamps and rubber stamps, and within printed and digital magazines and documentation,&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt; while some projects have focused on the intersection of mail art with the medium itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=[[The International Portfolio of Artists Photography]]|year=1984|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lettering and language===
Lettering, whether handwritten or printed, is integral to mail art. The written word is used as a literary art form, as well as for personal letters and notes sent with artwork and recordings of the spoken word, both of poetry and prose, are also a part of the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt; Although English has been the de facto language, because of the movement's inception in America, an increasing number of mail artists, and mail artist groups on the Internet, now communicate in Breton, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Russian.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Other media===
In addition to appropriating the postage stamp model, mail artists have assimilated other design formats for printed artworks. Artists' books, decobooks and [[friendship book]]s, banknotes, stickers, tickets, artist trading cards (ATCs), badges, food packaging, diagrams and maps have all been used.

[[File:Kairan MAZine(2007).jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''Kairan'' mail art zine, edited by Gianni Simone, aka Johnnyboy, 2007]]
Mail artists routinely mix media; [[collage]] and [[photomontage]] are popular, affording some mail art the stylistic qualities of [[pop art]] or Dada. Mail artists often use collage techniques to produce original postcards, envelopes and work that may be transformed using copy art techniques or computer software, then photocopied or printed out in limited editions.

[[Printed matter]] and [[ephemera]] are often circulated among mail artists, and after artistic treatment, these common items enter into the mail art network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Small assemblages, sculptural forms or found objects of irregular shapes and sizes are parceled up or sent unwrapped to deliberately tease and test the efficiency of the postal service. Mailable fake fur ("Hairmail") and [[Astroturf]] postcards were circulated in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news |

Having borrowed the notion of [[intermedia]] from Fluxus, mail artists are often active simultaneously in several different fields of expression. Music and [[sound art]] have long been celebrated aspects of mail art, at first using cassette tape, then on CD and as sound files sent via the Internet.&lt;ref name="CoxWarner2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Cox|author2=Daniel Warner|title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgDgCOSHPysC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 September 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1615-5|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Performance art]] has also been a prominent facet, particularly since the advent of mail art meetings and congresses. Performances recorded on film or video are communicated via DVD and movie files over the internet. Video is also increasingly being employed to document mail art shows of all kinds.&lt;ref name=mailartforum&gt;{{cite web|title=The Techniques|url=http://www.mail-art.de/frame.php?dir=about:about_techniques&amp;doc=start.htm|work=Mail-Art:The Forum|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Correspondence art is an elusive art form, far more variegated by its very nature than, say, painting. Where a painting always involves paint and a support surface, correspondence art can appear as any one of dozens of media transmitted through the mail. While the vast majority of correspondence art or mail art activities take place in the mail, today's new forms of electronic communication blur the edges of that forum. In the 1960s, when correspondence art first began to blossom, most artists found the postal service to be the most readily available - and least expensive - medium of exchange. Today's micro-computers with modern facilities offer anyone computing and communicating power that two decades ago were available only to the largest institutions and corporations, and only a few decades previous weren't available to anyone at any price." - [[Ken Friedman]]&lt;ref name=FriedmanFlue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Ken|title=Mail art history: the Fluxus factor|journal=FLUE - Special Issue: Mail Art|year=1984|volume=4|issue=3–4|editor1-first=Martha|editor1-last=Wilson|publisher=Franklin Furnace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cultural exchange is a radical act. It can create paradigms for the reverential sharing and preservation of the earth's water, soil, forests, plants and animals. The ethereal networker aesthetic calls for guiding that dream through action. Cooperation and participation, and the celebration of art as a birthing of life, vision, and spirit are first steps. The artists who meet each other in the Eternal Network have taken these steps. Their shared enterprise is a contribution to our common future." - [[Chuck Welch]]&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The purpose of mail art, an activity shared by many artists throughout the world, is to establish an aesthetical communication between artists and common people in every corner of the globe, to divulge their work outside the structures of the art market and outside the traditional venues and institutions: a free communication in which words and signs, texts and colours act like instruments for a direct and immediate interaction." - Loredana Parmesani&lt;ref&gt;Loredana Parmesani, text under the entry "Poesia visiva", in ''L'arte del secolo - Movimenti, teorie, scuole e tendenze 1900–2000'', Giò Marconi - Skira, Milan 1997 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Margarete Bieber''' (31 July 1879  &amp;ndash; 25 February 1978) was a Jewish&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Morgenstern]], ''"Jüdisches biographisches Lexikon. Eine Sammlung von bedeutenden Persönlichkeiten jüdischer Herkunft ab 1800"'', {{Interlanguage link multi|Lit Verlag|de}}, Wien; p. 91, 92&lt;/ref&gt; German-American [[art history|art historian]], [[classical archaeology|classical archaeologist]] and professor. She became the second woman university professor in Germany in 1919 when she took a position at the [[University of Giessen]]. She studied the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Rome]] as well as the sculpture and [[clothing in ancient Rome]] and [[Clothing in ancient Greece|Greece]].

Bieber left Germany after the Nazis seized power and she made her way to the United States where she taught at [[Barnard College]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Princeton University]]. She published hundreds of works during her career and authored definitive works in four areas of study: the Greek and Roman theater, Hellenistic sculpture, ancient dress, and Roman copies of Greek art.&lt;ref name="Medwid, M. 2000 p. 37"&gt;Medwid, M. (2000) The makers of classical archaeology, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; She emphasised that Roman reproductions of Greek originals were essentially Roman works and carried the stamp of Roman civilization.&lt;ref name="Medwid, M. 2000 p. 37"/&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Margarete Bieber was born on 31 July 1879 in [[Drzonowo, Szczecinek County|Schönau]], [[Schlochau (district)|Landkreis Schlochau]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.schlochau.de/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=46&lt;/ref&gt; (present day Drzonowo, [[Poland]]) to Jewish parents {{mdash}} Valli Bukofzer, and Jacob Heinrich Bieber, a factory owner.&lt;ref name="Two Worlds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonfante|first=Larissa|last2=Recke|first2=Matthias|title=Margarete Bieber: Two Worlds|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Breaking_Ground/bios/Bieber_Margarete.pdf|publisher=Brown University|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended a girls' school in [[Świecie|Schwetz]] (present day Świecie) for six years before being sent to a finishing school in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name="Two Worlds"/&gt;

In 1899 she went to Berlin where she attended Gymnasialkurse, a private school founded by [[Helene Lange]]. In 1901 she passed the ''Maturitätsprüfung'' in [[Toruń|Thorn]] and registered at the [[University of Berlin]]. As women were not allowed to enroll, she audited her classes, attending lectures by [[Hermann Alexander Diels]], [[Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz]] and [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]].&lt;ref name="Two Worlds"/&gt; She graduated in the winter semester 1901/02 in Berlin. In 1904 she moved to Bonn, studying under [[Paul Clemen]], [[Georg Loeschcke]] and [[Franz Bücheler]]. She received her PhD from the [[University of Bonn]] in 1907, her dissertation concerning representations of [[clothing in ancient Greece|ancient Greek costume]] in art.&lt;ref name="doah"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bieber, Margarete|url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/bieberm.htm|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAW"/&gt;

=== Research and professorship ===
In the following years, Bieber did extensive research throughout the Mediterranean. She was the first woman to receive a travel grant from the [[German Archaeological Institute]] (DAI) in 1909. From then until 1914, she did research in [[Athens]] and later [[Rome]]. She became a member of the DAI in 1913. When the [[First World War]] broke out, Bieber returned to Germany and worked as a [[Red Cross]] worker. From Easter 1915, she taught seminars and ran the Archaeological Institute at the University of Berlin for her former instructor Georg Loeschcke, who was ill. After he died in November 1915, a successor was appointed and she was not allowed to continue teaching as women could not receive [[habilitation]] at the time. Bieber continued to teach private courses out of her home, counting Dora and [[Erwin Panofsky]] among her students.&lt;ref&gt;Bonfante, Larissa. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27687337 "Margarete Bieber."] ''Gnomon'' 51 (September 1979), pp. 621–624.&lt;/ref&gt;

After several unsuccessful attempts, her postdoctoral was finally approved in 1919 and she became an associate professor in classical archaeology at the [[University of Giessen]]. She was the second woman to become a University professor in Germany.&lt;ref name="doah"/&gt; Beginning in 1928, she headed the Giessen Institute of Archaeology and in 1931, she was made a full professor. Her future looking secure, she adopted a six-year-old girl named Ingeborg in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freidenreich|first=Harriet Pass|title=Female, Jewish, and Educated: The Lives of Central European University Women|year=2002|publisher=Indiana Univ.

She, Ingeborg and her governess Katharina Freytag left Germany for England where Bieber became an honorary fellow at [[Somerville College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bieber, Margarete (1879–1978) - Art History|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/4549/Bieber-Margarete-1879-1978.html|publisher=JRank|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emigration to America ===
Bieber left for the United States in 1934 at the invitation of [[Barnard College]], where she was a lecturer.&lt;ref name="NAW"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Edward T. James |title=Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 5|year=2004|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard Univ. Press|location=Cambridge, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-674-01488-6|pages=56–57|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WSaMu4F06AQC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Margarete%20Bieber&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was recommended to [[Columbia University]], where she became a visiting professor in the Department of Art History and Archaeology in 1936. She applied for American citizenship in 1939.&lt;ref name="Two Worlds"/&gt;

In 1939, she published ''The History of the Greek and Roman Theater''. It became a foundational text for students of the ancient theaters of [[theatre of ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Rome]], delving into the nuances of production and the practicalities of staging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashby|first=Clifford|title=Classical Greek Theatre: New Views of an Old Subject|year=1998|publisher=University of Iowa Press|isbn=978-1-58729-463-1|pages=139–145|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vm3Fb6-vWXQC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Bieber assisted German refugees. She retired from Columbia University in 1948, though she continued to lecture at the [[Columbia University School of General Studies]] and at [[Princeton University]]. The [[Bollingen Foundation]] helped to fund ''The Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age'', published in 1955. &lt;!-- needs source: She was the first female professor at Princeton University. --&gt; She continued to publish works, describing sculpture in American museums and ancient clothing.&lt;ref name="NAW"/&gt;

Bieber was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1971&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1974, the [[Archaeological Institute of America]] awarded her the [[Gold Medal of the Archaeological Institute of America|Gold Medal for Distinguished Archaeological Achievement]]. She remained active in her later years, living with her adopted daughter, Ingeborg Sachs. Her final work, ''Ancient Copies'', was published in 1977 and detailed the transformation and reflection in Roman copies of Greek art. Bieber died on 25 February 1978 in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]]. She was 98.&lt;ref name="NAW"/&gt;

'''Marine biology''' is the scientific study of [[marine life]], organisms in the [[sea]].  Given that in [[biology]] many [[scientific classification|phyla]], families and [[genera]] have some species that live in the sea and others that live on land, marine biology classifies species based on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] rather than on [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

A large proportion of all [[life|life on Earth]] lives in the ocean. The exact size of this ''large proportion'' is unknown, since many ocean species are still to be discovered. The ocean is a complex three-dimensional world&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine-conservation.org/media/shining_sea/theme_oceanography.htm Oceanographic and Bathymetric Features] ''Marine Conservation Institute''. Uploaded 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; covering approximately 71% of the Earth's surface. The habitats studied in marine biology include everything from the tiny layers of surface water in which organisms and abiotic items may be trapped in [[surface tension]] between the ocean and atmosphere, to the depths of the [[oceanic trench]]es, sometimes 10,000 meters or more beneath the surface of the ocean. Specific habitats include [[coral reef]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[Seagrass|seagrass meadows]], the surrounds of [[seamount]]s and [[thermal vent]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ([[pelagic]]) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] to huge [[cetaceans]] (whales) {{convert|25-32|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length. [[Marine ecosystem|Marine ecology]] is the study of how marine organisms interact with each other and the environment.

Marine life is a vast resource, providing food, medicine, and raw materials, in addition to helping to support [[recreation]] and [[tourism]] all over the world. At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine organisms contribute significantly to the [[oxygen cycle]], and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's [[climate]].&lt;ref name="DMS"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo: An estimate of the feedback response| last1=Foley| first1=Jonathan A.| last2=Taylor| first2=Karl E.| last3=Ghan| first3=Steven J.| doi=10.1007/BF00142502| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm3h1q666x206h46| journal=Climatic Change| volume=18| issue=1| year=1991| pages=1| bibcode=1991ClCh...18....1F}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shore]]lines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.&lt;ref name="Sousa"&gt;{{cite book| last=Sousa| first=Wayne P.| editor1-last=Pickett| editor1-first=Steward T.

Many species are economically important to humans, including both finfish and shellfish. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the [[carbon cycle]]) and of air (such as [[Global climate model|Earth's respiration]], and movement of energy through [[ecosystem]]s including the ocean). Large areas beneath the ocean surface still remain effectively unexplored.

{{main| History of marine biology}}
[[File:Scyliorhinus retifer embryo.JPG|thumb|left|[[Aristotle's biology|Aristotle]] recorded that the [[embryo]] of [[Mustelus canis|&lt;!--a different species shown--&gt;a dogfish]] was attached by a cord to a kind of placenta (the [[yolk sac]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leroi, Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=72–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The study of marine biology dates back to [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC), who made [[Aristotle's biology#Empirical research|many observations of life in the sea]] around [[Lesbos]], laying the foundation for many future discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;"History of the Study of Marine Biology - MarineBio.org". MarineBio Conservation Society. Web. Monday, March 31, 2014. &lt;http://marinebio.org/oceans/history-of-marine-biology.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1768, [[Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin]] (1744–1774) published the ''Historia Fucorum'', the first work dedicated to marine [[algae]] and the first book on marine biology to use the then new [[binomial nomenclature]] of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]. It included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Gmelin S G (1768) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=YUAAAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Historia+Fucorum%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jf7RVPC9NoSB8gXviID4BQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historia%20Fucorum%22&amp;f=false ''Historia Fucorum''] Ex typographia Academiae scientiarum, St. Petersburg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silva PC, Basson PW and Moe RL (1996) [https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=vuWEemVY8WEC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22Historia+Fucorum%22+binomial+nomenclature&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SfE_cKqtLV&amp;sig=SEiuY0v1D--rDWFi77nh0SSFaz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=V__RVJyGGIn98QW06oLwCg&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historia%20Fucorum%22%20binomial%20nomenclature&amp;f=false ''Catalogue of the Benthic Marine Algae of the Indian Ocean''] page 2, University of California Press. {{ISBN|9780520915817}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The British naturalist [[Edward Forbes]] (1815–1854) is generally regarded as the founder of the science of marine biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Marine Biology and Oceanography|url=http://www.meer.org/ebook/mbhist.htm|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pace of oceanographic and marine biology studies quickly accelerated during the course of the 19th century.

[[File:Challenger.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|{{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} during its [[Challenger expedition|pioneer expedition]] of 1872–76}}]]

The observations made in the first studies of marine biology fueled the [[age of discovery]] and exploration that followed. During this time, a vast amount of knowledge was gained about the life that exists in the oceans of the world. Many voyages contributed significantly to this pool of knowledge. Among the most significant were the voyages of {{HMS|Beagle}} where [[Charles Darwin]] came up with his theories of [[evolution]] and on the formation of [[coral reefs]].&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Ritchie R. Into the ocean world; the biology of the sea. 1st ed. New York: Knopf; [distributed by Random House], 1974: 161&lt;/ref&gt; Another important expedition was undertaken by [[HMS Challenger (1858)|HMS ''Challenger'']], where findings were made of unexpectedly high [[species diversity]] among [[fauna]] stimulating much theorizing by population ecologists on how such varieties of life could be maintained in what was thought to be such a hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;Gage, John D., and Paul A. Tyler. Deep-sea biology: a natural history of organisms at the deep-sea floor. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991: 1&lt;/ref&gt; This era was important for the history of marine biology but naturalists were still limited in their studies because they lacked technology that would allow them to adequately examine species that lived in deep parts of the oceans.

The creation of marine laboratories was important because it allowed marine biologists to conduct research and process their specimens from expeditions. The oldest marine laboratory in the world, [[Station biologique de Roscoff]], was established in France in 1872. In the United States, the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] dates back to 1903, while the prominent [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]] was founded in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Maienschein, Jane. 100 years exploring life, 1888-1988: the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole. Boston: Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 1989: 189-192&lt;/ref&gt; The development of technology such as sound navigation ranging, scuba diving gear, submersibles and remotely operated vehicles allowed marine biologists to discover and explore life in deep oceans that was once thought to not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Genny|title=Beginnings: History of Marine Science|url=http://marinebio.net/marinescience/01intro/behist.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microscopic life ===
[[File:Copepodkils.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Copepod]]}}]]
{{main article|Marine microorganism}}

As inhabitants of the largest environment on Earth, microbial marine systems drive changes in every global system.  Microbes are responsible for virtually all the [[photosynthesis]] that occurs in the ocean, as well as the cycling of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and other [[nutrients]] and trace elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/12/151210181647.htm |title=Functions of global ocean microbiome key to understanding environmental changes |date=December 10, 2015 |website=www.sciencedaily.com |publisher=University of Georgia |access-date=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microscopic life undersea is incredibly diverse and still poorly understood. For example, the role of [[virus]]es in marine ecosystems is barely being explored even in the beginning of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suttle
|first=C.A.|title=Viruses in the Sea|journal=Nature|year=2005|volume=437|issue=9|pages=356–361|doi=10.1038/nature04160|pmid=16163346|bibcode=2005Natur.437..356S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of [[phytoplankton]] is better understood due to their critical position as the most numerous [[primary production|primary producers]] on Earth. Phytoplankton are categorized into [[cyanobacteria]] (also called blue-green algae/bacteria), various types of [[algae]] (red, green, brown, and yellow-green), [[diatom]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[Euglenid|euglenoids]], [[coccolithophorid]]s, [[cryptomonad]]s, [[chrysophyte]]s, [[chlorophyte]]s, [[prasinophyte]]s, and [[silicoflagellate]]s.

[[Zooplankton]] tend to be somewhat larger, and not all are microscopic. Many [[Protozoa]] are zooplankton, including dinoflagellates, [[zooflagellate]]s, [[foraminifera]]ns, and [[radiolarian]]s. Some of these (such as dinoflagellates) are also phytoplankton; the distinction between plants and animals often breaks down in very small organisms. Other zooplankton include [[cnidarian]]s, [[Ctenophora (phylum)|ctenophore]]s, [[chaetognatha|chaetognaths]], [[mollusc]]s, [[arthropod]]s, [[Tunicate|urochordates]], and [[annelid]]s such as [[polychaete]]s. Many larger animals begin their life as zooplankton before they become large enough to take their familiar forms. Two examples are [[fish larva]]e and sea stars (also called [[starfish]]).

=== Plants and algae ===
Microscopic algae and plants provide important habitats for life, sometimes acting as hiding places for larval forms of larger fish and foraging places for invertebrates.

Algal life is widespread and very diverse under the ocean. Microscopic photosynthetic algae contribute a larger proportion of the world's photosynthetic output than all the terrestrial forests combined. Most of the [[ecological niche|niche]] occupied by sub plants on land is actually occupied by macroscopic [[algae]] in the ocean, such as ''[[Sargassum]]'' and [[kelp]], which are commonly known as [[seaweed]]s that create [[kelp forest]]s.

Plants that survive in the sea are often found in shallow waters, such as the [[seagrass]]es (examples of which are eelgrass, ''[[Zostera]]'', and turtle grass, ''Thalassia''). These plants have adapted to the high salinity of the ocean environment. The [[foreshore|intertidal zone]] is also a good place to find plant life in the sea, where [[mangroves]] or [[cordgrass]] or [[Ammophila (Poaceae)|beach grass]] might grow. 
{{clear}}

===Invertebrates===
[[File:Crown of Thorns-jonhanson.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Crown-of-thorns starfish]]}}]]
{{Main|Marine invertebrates}}

As on land, [[invertebrates]] make up a huge portion of all life in the sea. Invertebrate sea life includes [[Cnidaria]] such as [[jellyfish]] and [[sea anemone]]s; [[Ctenophora (phylum)|Ctenophora]]; [[sea worm]]s including the [[phylum (biology)|phyla]] [[Platyhelminthes]], [[Nemertea]], [[Annelida]], [[Sipuncula]], [[Echiura]], [[Chaetognatha]], and [[Phoronida]]; [[Mollusca]] including [[shellfish]], [[squid]], [[octopus]]; [[Arthropoda]] including [[Chelicerata]] and [[Crustacea]]; [[Porifera]]; [[Bryozoa]]; [[Echinodermata]] including starfish; and [[Urochordata]] including [[sea squirt]]s or [[tunicate]]s. Invertebrates have no backbone. There are over a million species.

==== Reptiles ====
[[File:Chelonia mydas and bubbles.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Green turtle]]}}]]
{{Main|Marine reptile}}

[[Reptile]]s which inhabit or frequent the sea include [[sea turtle]]s, [[sea snake]]s, [[terrapin]]s, the [[marine iguana]], and the [[saltwater crocodile]]. Most [[extant taxon|extant]] marine reptiles, except for some sea snakes, are [[oviparity|oviparous]] and need to return to land to lay their eggs. Thus most species, excepting sea turtles, spend most of their lives on or near land rather than in the ocean. Despite their marine adaptations, most sea snakes prefer shallow waters nearby land, around islands, especially waters that are somewhat sheltered, as well as near estuaries.&lt;ref name="Sti74"&gt;Stidworthy J. 1974. Snakes of the World. Grosset &amp; Dunlap Inc. 160 pp. {{ISBN|0-448-11856-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RAS-FAO"&gt;[ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/y0870e/y0870e65.pdf Sea snakes]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at [http://www.fao.org/ Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations].

[[ File:Black-browed albatross.jpg|thumb | left| An albatross hovering over the ocean looking for prey.]] 
Birds adapted to living in the [[marine environment]] are often called [[seabird]]s. Examples include [[albatross]], [[penguin]]s, [[gannet]]s, and [[auk]]s. Although they spend most of their lives in the ocean, species such as [[gull]]s can often be found thousands of miles inland.

==== Mammals ====
[[File:Sea otters holding hands, cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sea otter]]s]]
{{Main| Marine mammal}}

There are five main types of marine mammals, namely [[cetacea]]ns ([[toothed whale]]s and [[baleen whale]]s); [[sirenian]]s such as [[manatee]]s;  [[pinniped]]s including seals and the [[walrus]]; [[sea otter]]s; and the 
[[polar bear]]. All are air-breathing, and while some such as the [[sperm whale]] can dive for prolonged periods, all must return to the surface to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0019653| pmid=21625431| title=Current and Future Patterns of Global Marine Mammal Biodiversity| journal=PLoS ONE| volume=6| issue=5| pages=e19653| year=2011| last1=Kaschner | first1=K. | last2=Tittensor | first2=D.

==Marine habitats==
{{ocean habitat topics|image=Callyspongia sp. (Tube sponge).jpg|caption=[[Coral reef]]s provide marine habitats for tube sponges, which in turn become marine habitats for fish}}
{{main|Marine habitats}}

Marine habitats can be divided into [[coastal]] and [[open ocean]] habitats. Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from the [[shoreline]] to the edge of the [[continental shelf]]. Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean area. Open ocean habitats are found in the deep ocean beyond the edge of the continental shelf. Alternatively, marine habitats can be divided into [[pelagic]] and [[demersal]] habitats. Pelagic habitats are found near the surface or in the open [[water column]], away from the bottom of the ocean and affected by [[ocean current]]s, while demersal habitats are near or on the bottom. Marine habitats can be modified by their inhabitants. Some marine organisms, like corals, kelp and sea grasses, are [[ecosystem engineer]]s which reshape the marine environment to the point where they create further habitat for other organisms.

===Intertidal and near shore===
[[File:Tide pools in santa cruz.jpg|thumb|left|Tide pools with sea stars and [[sea anemone]]]]

[[Intertidal zone]]s, the areas that are close to the shore, are constantly being exposed and covered by the ocean's [[tides]]. A huge array of life can be found within this zone. Shore habitats span from the upper intertidal zones to the area where land vegetation takes prominence. It can be underwater anywhere from daily to very infrequently. Many species here are scavengers, living off of sea life that is washed up on the shore. Many land animals also make much use of the shore and intertidal habitats. A subgroup of organisms in this habitat bores and grinds exposed rock through the process of [[bioerosion]].{{clear left}}

===Estuaries===
[[File:Urdaibai, Bizkaia, Euskal Herria.jpg|thumb|left|Estuaries have shifting flows of sea water and fresh water.]]

[[Estuaries]] are also near shore and influenced by the [[tides]]. An estuary is a partially enclosed coastal body of water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it and with a free connection to the open sea.&lt;ref name="james"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pritchard |first=D. W. |year=1967 |chapter= What is an estuary: physical viewpoint |pages=3–5 |editor-first=G. H. |editor-last=Lauf |title= Estuaries |series=A.A.A.S. Publ. |volume=83 |location=Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Estuaries form a transition zone between freshwater river environments and saltwater maritime environments. They are subject both to marine influences—such as tides, waves, and the influx of saline water—and to riverine influences—such as flows of fresh water and sediment. The shifting flows of both sea water and fresh water provide high levels of nutrients both in the water column and in sediment, making estuaries among the most productive natural habitats in the world.&lt;ref name="McLusky"&gt;{{cite book |last=McLusky |first=D. S. |last2=Elliott |first2=M. |year=2004 |title=The Estuarine Ecosystem: Ecology, Threats and Management |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-852508-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

=== Reefs ===
[[File:Maldivesfish2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Coral reef]]s form complex marine ecosystems with tremendous [[biodiversity]].]]
{{Main| Coral reef}}

[[Reef]]s comprise some of the densest and most diverse habitats in the world. The best-known types of reefs are [[tropical]] [[coral reef]]s which exist in most tropical waters; however, reefs can also exist in cold water. Reefs are built up by [[coral]]s and other [[calcium]]-depositing animals, usually on top of a rocky outcrop on the ocean floor. Reefs can also grow on other surfaces, which has made it possible to create [[artificial reef]]s. Coral reefs also support a huge community of life, including the corals themselves, their symbiotic [[zooxanthellae]], tropical fish and many other organisms.

Much attention in marine biology is focused on coral reefs and the [[El Niño]] weather phenomenon. In 1998, coral reefs experienced the most severe mass bleaching events on record, when vast expanses of reefs across the world died because sea surface temperatures rose well above normal.&lt;ref&gt;NOAA (1998) Record-breaking coral bleaching occurred in tropics this year. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]], Press release (October 23, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRS (1998) Statement on Global Coral Bleaching in 1997-1998. International Coral Reef Society, October 15, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Some reefs are recovering, but scientists say that between 50% and 70% of the world's coral reefs are now endangered and predict that [[global warming]] could exacerbate this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, D., Burke, L., McManus, J., et al.

IUCN, Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

===Open ocean===
[[File:Humpback stellwagen edit.jpg|thumb|left|The open ocean is the area of deep sea beyond the [[continental shelves]]]]
{{Main| Pelagic zone}}

The open ocean is relatively unproductive because of a lack of nutrients, yet because it is so vast, in total it produces the most primary productivity. The open ocean is separated into different zones, and the different zones each have different ecologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marinebio.org/oceans/open-ocean/|title=The Open Ocean - MarineBio.org|website=marinebio.org|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zones which vary according to their depth include the [[epipelagic]], [[mesopelagic]], [[bathypelagic]], [[abyssopelagic]], and [[hadopelagic]] zones. Zones which vary by the amount of light they receive include the [[Photic zone|photic]] and [[aphotic zone]]s. Much of the aphotic zone's energy is supplied by the open ocean in the form of [[detritus]].{{clear left}}

=== Deep sea and trenches ===
[[File:Deep sea chimaera.jpg|thumb|A deep-sea chimaera. Its snout is covered with tiny pores capable of detecting animals by perturbations in electric fields.]]

The deepest recorded [[oceanic trench]] measured to date is the [[Mariana Trench]], near the [[Philippines]], in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at {{convert|10,924|m|ft|abbr=on}}. At such depths, [[water pressure]] is extreme and there is no sunlight, but some life still exists. A white [[flatfish]], a shrimp and a jellyfish were seen by the American crew of the [[bathyscaphe]] ''[[Bathyscaphe Trieste|Trieste]]'' when it dove to the bottom in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml Seven Miles Down: The Story of The Bathyscaph Trieste.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202144233/http://bjsonline.com/watches/articles/0022_3.shtml |date=2007-02-02 }}, ''Rolex Deep Sea Special'', January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the deep sea is considered to start at the [[aphotic zone]], the point where sunlight loses its power of transference through the water.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Many life forms that live at these depths have the ability to create their own light known as [[bio-luminescence]]. Marine life also flourishes around [[seamount]]s that rise from the depths, where fish and other sea life congregate to spawn and feed. [[Hydrothermal vent]]s along the [[mid-ocean ridge]] spreading centers act as [[oasis|oases]], as do their opposites, [[cold seeps]]. Such places support unique [[biome]]s and many new [[microbe]]s and other lifeforms have been discovered at these locations .{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Subfields ==
The [[marine ecosystem]] is large, and thus there are many sub-fields of marine biology. Most involve studying specializations of particular animal groups, such as [[phycology]], [[invertebrate zoology]] and [[ichthyology]]. Other subfields study the physical effects of continual immersion in [[sea water]] and the ocean in general, adaptation to a salty environment, and the effects of changing various oceanic properties on marine life. A subfield of marine biology studies the relationships between oceans and ocean life, and global warming and environmental issues (such as [[carbon dioxide]] displacement). Recent marine [[biotechnology]] has focused largely on marine [[biomolecule]]s, especially [[protein]]s, that may have uses in medicine or engineering. Marine environments are the home to many exotic biological materials that may inspire [[Bionics|biomimetic material]]s.

=== Related fields ===
Marine biology is a branch of [[biology]]. It is closely linked to [[oceanography]] and may be regarded as a sub-field of [[marine science]]. It also encompasses many ideas from [[ecology]]. [[Fisheries science]] and [[marine conservation]] can be considered partial offshoots of marine biology (as well as [[environmental studies]]). Marine Chemistry, Physical oceanography and Atmospheric sciences are closely related to this field.

==Distribution factors==
An active research topic in marine biology is to discover and map the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]s of various species and where they spend their time. Technologies that aid in this discovery include [[pop-up satellite archival tag]]s, [[acoustic tag]]s, and a variety of other [[data loggers]]. Marine biologists study how the [[ocean current]]s, [[tide]]s and many other oceanic factors affect ocean life forms, including their growth, distribution and well-being. This has only recently become technically feasible with advances in [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and newer underwater visual devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Most ocean life breeds in specific places, nests or not in others, spends time as juveniles in still others, and in maturity in yet others. Scientists know little about where many species spend different parts of their life cycles especially in the infant and juvenile years. For example, it is still largely unknown where juvenile [[sea turtle]]s and some year-1 [[shark]]s travel. Recent advances in underwater tracking devices are illuminating what we know about marine organisms that live at great Ocean depths.&lt;ref&gt;http://us7.campaign-archive2.com/?u=82eb97f4b587306a3537ecf16&amp;id=e398851e6b&amp;e=%5BUNIQID%5D&lt;/ref&gt; The information that [[pop-up satellite archival tag]]s give aids in certain time of the year fishing closures and development of a [[marine protected area]]. This data is important to both scientists and fishermen because they are discovering that by restricting commercial fishing in one small area they can have a large impact in maintaining a healthy fish population in a much larger area.

The '''Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity''' ([[German language|German]]: ''Max-Planck-Institut zur Erforschung multireligiöser und multiethnischer Gesellschaften'') is located in [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]]. It is one of 83 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft'').
[[File:Max-Planck-Institut zur Erforschung multireligiöser und multiethnischer Gesellschaften Hermann-Föge-Weg 12 Göttingen.jpg|thumb|Institute building in Göttingen]]

==History==
The MPI for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity is the successor of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for German History]] previously established in 1917 in [[Berlin]]. Founded in 1956 as the [[Max Planck Institute for History]], the institute  was renamed to its current form based on the decision of the Senate of the [[Max Planck Society]] in March 2007.

==Research==
The Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity is one of the foremost centers for the multi-disciplinary study of diversity, in its multiple forms, in today’s globalizing world. As societies across the globe become ever more diverse, pressing new challenges emerge to the fore, motivating the study of questions such as the relationship between mobility and inequality; the interaction of globalization, religious diversity, and the secular state; the legal boundaries of cultural accommodation; global cities and super-diversity within them; new forms of membership and belonging; and the trans-bordering networking of ethnic and religious minorities. These thematic clusters provide a glimpse into the foundational queries that animate the rigorous scholarly investigation pursued by researchers at the Institute through a variety of disciplinary perspectives, including, but not limited to, anthropology, sociology, political science, and law.

==Departments==

===Ethics, Law and Politics===
The department, led by Ayelet Shachar, focuses on questions of citizenship, identity, and mobility are at the frontiers of scholarly research. Researchers at the department explore these developments and ask foundational questions, cutting across traditional disciplinary lines, with special emphasis placed on three interrelated themes: the relationship between diversity and equality in public law and private dispute resolution; the legal construction of borders and membership boundaries; and the intersection of states and markets in defining “who belongs“ within the political community, according to what criteria, and with what implications for shaping new disparities of mobility and opportunity at a time of profound and rapid migration and globalization pressures. The focus is on cutting-edge theoretical and legal puzzles; comparative approaches and international collaboration are strongly encouraged. 

===Religious Diversity===
The department, led by [[Peter van der Veer]], offers a research program developed within the ideographic tradition of [[anthropology]] and [[religious studies]] and thus allows for quite a variety of individual projects that try to answer questions that are not predetermined by theoretical models but developed in ethnographic or micro-sociological fieldwork. To contain this variety, a regional focus on South, South-East and East Asia has been chosen because of the importance of this region in terms of its share in the world’s population and with the assumption that comparisons can be fruitfully made across this region. This is because common civilizational histories as well as common histories of imperialism and cold war politics have transformed the religious traditions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] into "modern religions" in the Western sense. From the start, concerted efforts have been made to create collaborations with research institutions and researchers in the societies in which fieldwork projects are carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/religious-diversity/ |title=Religious diversity - Research focus |author=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socio-Cultural Diversity===
The department, led by Steven Vertovec, is devoted to comparative empirical investigation and theoretical development surrounding various modes and manifestations of migration-driven diversity and [[superdiversity]]. The categories of diversity most relevant to their research interests are race and ethnicity, religion, gender, class, migration channel and migration status. Moreover, they are particularly interested in the ways and processes by which patterns of migration-driven diversity are related to other modes of increasing social, cultural, economic and political differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |URL=http://www.mmg.mpg.de/departments/socio-cultural-diversity/research-focus/ |title=Socio-cultural diversity - Research focus |author=Max Planck Institute for the Study of Religious and Ethnic Diversity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mining Code''', '''Mining Law''' or '''Miners' Law''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Закон о рудницима}}) or '''Novo Brdo Code''' ({{lang|sr|Новобрдски законик}}),  is a compilation of laws on mining in the [[Serbian Despotate]], enacted by Despot [[Stefan Lazarević]] on 29 January 1412, formulated earlier in 1390. Apart from mining laws, there are legal provisions concerning the organization and life in [[Novo Brdo Fortress|Novo Brdo]] ({{lang|sr|Статут Новог Брда}}, the ''Statute of Novo Brdo''), a city which at that time was the largest mine in the Balkans. The compilation is survived in several later transcripts, of which a 16th-century illustrated manuscript is regarded the most important.

[[File:Biome_map_10.svg|thumb|right|250px|Extent of montane grasslands and shrublands]]
'''Montane grasslands and shrublands''' is a [[biome]] defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]]. The biome includes high altitude [[grassland]]s and [[shrubland]]s around the world. The term "montane" in the name of the biome refers to "high altitude", rather than the ecological term which denotes the region below [[treeline]].

Montane grasslands and shrublands located above the tree line are commonly known{{By whom|date=December 2018}} as [[alpine tundra]], which occurs in mountain regions around the world. Below the tree line are subalpine and montane grasslands and shrublands. Stunted subalpine forests are known as [[krummholz]], and occur just below the tree line, where harsh, windy conditions and poor soils create dwarfed and twisted forests of slow-growing trees.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

Montane grasslands and shrublands, particularly in [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] regions, often evolved as virtual islands, separated from other montane regions by warmer, lower elevation regions, and are frequently home to many distinctive and [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plants which evolved in response to the cool, wet [[climate]] and abundant tropical sunlight. Characteristic plants of these habitats display adaptations such as rosette structures, waxy surfaces, and hairy leaves.   A unique feature of many wet tropical montane regions is the presence of giant rosette plants from a variety of plant families, such as ''[[Lobelia]]'' ([[Afrotropic]]), ''[[Puya (genus)|Puya]]'' ([[Neotropic]]), ''[[Cyathea]]'' ([[New Guinea]]), and ''[[Argyroxiphium]]'' ([[Hawaii]]).

The most extensive montane grasslands and shrublands occur in the [[Neotropic]] [[Páramo]] of the [[Andes Mountains]]. This biome also occurs in the mountains of [[East Africa|east]] and [[central Africa]], [[Mount Kinabalu]] of [[Borneo]], highest elevations of the [[Western Ghats]] in [[South India]] and the Central Highlands of [[New Guinea]]. 

Where conditions are drier, one finds montane grasslands, savannas, and woodlands, like the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], and montane [[steppe]]s, like the steppes of the [[Tibetan Plateau]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6517">'''Moshe Greenberg''' ([[Hebrew]]: משה גרינברג; July 10, 1928 – May 15, 2010) was an American Jewish [[rabbi]], [[Bible]] scholar, and professor emeritus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

==Biography==
Moshe Greenberg was born in [[Philadelphia]] in 1928. Raised in a Hebrew-speaking [[Zionist]] home, he studied Bible and Hebrew literature from his youth. His father, Rabbi [[Simon Greenberg]], was the rabbi of Har Zion Temple and one of the most important leaders of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]]. Moshe Greenberg received his doctorate from the  [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1954, studying  Bible and [[Assyriology]] under [[E. A. Speiser]]; simultaneously, he studied post-Biblical [[Judaica]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]] (JTSA), where he was ordained as a rabbi. Greenberg was married to Evelyn Gelber and had three sons. He died in [[Jerusalem]] after a long illness.&lt;ref name="jewishexponent.com"&gt;[http://www.jewishexponent.com/article/21288/ Professor's Death Means Loss of a Biblical Giant]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic and literary career==
Greenberg taught Bible and Judaica at the University of Pennsylvania from 1964-1970.  He held a chair in [[Jewish studies]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], an institution at which he had taught since 1970. He also taught at [[Swarthmore College]], the JTSA,  the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies]].  Greenberg was editor-in-chief of the [[Ketuvim]] section of the [[Jewish Publication Society of America]]'s [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|new English]] translation of the [[Bible]]. He was the author of ten books and numerous articles.

==Scholarship==
Greenberg was the first Jewish Bible scholar appointed to a position in a secular university after [[World War II]] and had an important influence on the development of [[Biblical scholarship]].&lt;ref name="jewishexponent.com"/&gt; He focused on the phenomenology of biblical religion and law, the theory and practice of interpreting biblical texts, and the role of  the Bible in Jewish thought. In the area of prayer, Greenberg studied the development of biblical petition and  praise, which he portrayed as  "a vehicle of humility, an expression of  un-selfsufficiency, which in biblical thought, is the proper stance  of  humans before God" (Studies, 75-108).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/arts/20greenberg.html New York Times obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that the prose prayers embedded in biblical narratives reflect the piety of commoners, and reasoned that the frequency of spontaneous prayer strengthened the egalitarian tendency of Israelite religion which led to the establishment  of  the  [[synagogue]]. In the  area  of biblical law, Greenberg argued that "the law [is] the expression of underlying postulates or  values of culture" and that differences  between biblical and ancient Near Eastern laws  were not reflections  of  different stages of social  development  but  of different underlying legal and religious principles (Studies, 25-41). Analyzing economic, social,  political,  and religious laws in the [[Torah]], he showed that they dispersed authority throughout society and prevented the monopolization of prestige and  power by narrow elite groups (Studies, 51-61). In his commentaries on [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] (1969) and [[Ezekiel]]  (1983, 1997), Greenberg developed  a "holistic"  method  of  exegesis, redirecting attention from the text's  "hypothetically  reconstructed  elements"  to the  biblical  books  as integral  wholes and products of  thoughtful  and  artistic design. 	Greenberg's studies of Jewish thought include studies of the  intellectual  achievements  of  medieval  Jewish   exegesis, investigations  of rabbinic  reflections on defying illegal orders (Studies, 395-403), and  attitudes toward members of other  religions  (Studies, 369-393; "A Problematic Heritage"). He argued that a  Scripture-based  religion must avoid fundamentalism through selectivity and re-prioritizing values.

==Awards==
* In 1961, Greenberg was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].
* He was also awarded  the Harrison Prize for Distinguished Teaching and Research.
* In 1994, he was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] in Bible.&lt;ref name=prize&gt;{{Cite web| title = Israel Prize Official Site - Recipients in 1994 (in Hebrew)| url = http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/TashnagTashsab/TASNAG_TASNAT_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashnad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg also taught at Beyt Midrash leShalom, the Peace Study Center sponsored jointly by the Israeli Religious Peace Movement Netivot Shalom and by Tikkun Magazine.

A '''mound system''' is an alternative to the traditional rural [[septic system]] [[drain field]].  The mound system is an engineered drain field used in areas where septic systems are more prone to failure due to having extremely [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeable]] or impermeable soils, [[soil]] with shallow cover over porous bedrock, and soils that have a high seasonal [[water table]].&lt;ref name="WI1"&gt;Converse, J.C., and J.E. Tyler. 2000. "WISCONSIN MOUND SOIL ABSORPTION SYSTEM:." Accessed on 10 Oct. 2007. [http://www.soils.wisc.edu/sswmp/SSWMP_15.24.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary waste liquids cleaning and purification action in a drain field is performed by a [[biofilm]] in the loose fill surrounding the perforated drain tile. If the soil permeability is too low, liquid is not absorbed fast enough, resulting in surface ponding of unsanitary liquids. If the soil permeability is too high, or is exposed to  fractured bedrock, the wastewater quickly penetrates down to the water table before the biofilm has time to purify the water leading to contamination of the [[aquifer]]. In either situation, the mound system provides an ideal habitat for the biofilm and has the correct permeability to assure slow absorption of effluent into the mound before exiting as purified water into the surrounding environment.

==History==

The mound system was originally designed in the 1940s by the [[North Dakota State University|North Dakota College of Agriculture]].&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt; It was known as the Nodak Disposal System.  In 1976 the [[University of Wisconsin]] studied the mound systems under the university's Waste Management Project.  This project published the first design manual indicating the appropriate site conditions and design criteria for mounds. In 2000 a new manual was released.&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt;

==Design==
The mound system includes a [[septic tank]], a dosing chamber, and a mound.  Waste from homes is sent to the septic tank where the solid fraction settles to the bottom of the tank.  The effluent is sent to a second tank called a ''dosing chamber,'' from which the effluent is distributed to the mound at a metered rate (in ''doses'').  Wastewater is partially treated as it moves through the mound sand.  Final treatment and disposal occurs in the soil beneath the mound.  The mound system can also better handle the effluent since it doesn't all come into the mound at once allowing it to clean the effluent better which helps to keep the system from failing.

The absorption mound is built in layers at different depths. The depths of these layers are determined by the depth of the limiting layer of the soil, which may be a seasonal [[water table]], bedrock, [[fragipan]], or [[Till|glacial till]].&lt;ref name="Ohio8"&gt;Hamilton County General Health District. 2005. Household Sewage Treatment System. Hamilton County. Accessed on Oct. 15, 2007. [http://www.hamiltoncountyhealth.org/files/files/Fact%20Sheets/Water%20Quality/HSTS%20Manual/HSTS%20Manual%20Part%201.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;  Standards created by [[Ohio State University]] state that 24&amp;nbsp;inches of natural soil should be above the limiting layer in the soil. A layer of specifically sized sand is placed on top of the natural soil so that the natural soil and sand reach a depth of 4 feet. The distribution pipes that are fed by the dosing chamber are placed on top of the sand in layers of gravel. Then [[Geotextile|construction fabric]] and soil are placed on top of the gravel to help keep the pipes from freezing.  The top layer of soil also allows the mound to be planted with grass or non-woody plants in order to control erosion &lt;ref name="Ref7"&gt;7 Mancl, K. 2001. Managing Septic Tank-Mound Systems. Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet. Ohio State University. Accessed on 15 Oct 2007 [http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0753.html Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213191927/http://ohioline.osu.edu/aex-fact/0753.html |date=2007-12-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When installing a mound system, the soil in the area where the mound is to be placed will not be compacted or disturbed. Any trees that are on the area are cut away at ground level, and the roots and stumps left in place.  The surface of the area for the mound is then roughened up with a [[Plow#Chisel plough|chisel plough]]. This prepares the area for the sand. Work is done from upslope of the mound area so that the ground down slope of the mound does not get compacted. Tyler tables are used to help determine the area of a mound.
&lt;!-- nonexistent cite &lt;sup&gt;(11)&lt;/sup&gt; --&gt;

Time dosing is an important aspect in the functioning of the mound system.  Research done by Darby on sand filters showed that short frequent doses of effluent onto sand filters with orifices that are closely spaced helps to improve effluent quality.&lt;ref name="Ref10"&gt;Ohio Department of Health. 2007. Sand Mounds with Pressure Distribution. Special Device Approval per OAC 3701-29-20(C). Ohio Department of Health. Accessed on Dec 3, 2007 [http://www.odh.ohio.gov/ASSETS/966F83AB6DAE480DB50DD2A03A25A4C5/MDsd7-07.pdf Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231162711/http://www.odh.ohio.gov/ASSETS/966F83AB6DAE480DB50DD2A03A25A4C5/MDsd7-07.pdf |date=2008-12-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, demand dosing releases large amounts of effluent at once, which passes through the sand very rapidly.  This does not give the biota the proper amount of time to clean the effluent.&lt;ref name="WI1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4297">'''NERI''', the '''National Environmental Research Institute of Denmark''' ({{lang-da|Danmarks Miljøundersøgelser}} or simply ''DMU'') was an independent research institute under the [[University of Aarhus|Aarhus University]]. NERI undertook scientific consultancy work and monitoring of nature and the environment as well as applied and strategic research. NERI’s primary task was to establish a scientific foundation for environmental policy decisions.

NERI participated in a large number of national and international research programmes, and also in scientific working groups, commissions, and organizations under such bodies as the [[European Union]] and the [[United Nations]].

NERI closed in 2011. On 1 July 2011, the consultancy side was reorganised into The DCE - [[Danish Centre for Environment and Energy]], while the research departments of the old NERI are now divided between the Department of Bioscience and the Department of Environmental Science. All three areas are part of Aarhus University.

==Departments within NERI==

NERI includes a number of departments devoted to various environmental and ecological categories:

* Department of Policy Analysis
* Department of Atmospheric Environment
* Department of Marine Ecology
* Department of Environmental Chemistry and Microbiology
* Department of Arctic Environment
* Department of Terrestrial Ecology
* Department of Freshwater Ecology

A '''noise barrier''' (also called a '''soundwall''', '''noise wall''', '''sound berm''', '''sound barrier''', or '''acoustical barrier''') is an exterior structure designed to protect inhabitants of sensitive [[land use]] areas from [[noise pollution]]. Noise barriers are the most effective method of mitigating [[roadway noise|roadway]], railway, and industrial noise sources – 
other than cessation of the source activity or use of source controls.

In the case of surface transportation noise, [[Noise mitigation#Roadways|other methods]] of reducing the source noise intensity include encouraging the use of [[Hybrid vehicles|hybrid]] and [[electric vehicle]]s, improving [[Automotive aerodynamics|automobile aerodynamics]] and [[tire]] design, and choosing low-noise [[Pavement (material)|paving material]].  Extensive use of noise barriers began in the [[United States]] after [[noise regulation]]s were introduced in the early 1970s.

==History==

Noise barriers have been built in the [[United States]] since the mid-twentieth century, when vehicular traffic burgeoned.  I-680 in [[Milpitas, California]] was the first noise barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wagner|first1=Kate|title=Building the Wall:  Highway Sound Barriers and the Evolution of Noise|url=http://99percentinvisible.org/article/building-wall-highway-sound-barriers-evolution-noise/|accessdate=21 March 2017|work=[[99 Percent Invisible]]|date=8 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1960s, analytic [[acoustics|acoustical]] technology emerged to mathematically evaluate the efficacy of a noise barrier design adjacent to a specific [[roadway]]. By the 1990s, noise barriers that included use of transparent materials were being designed in [[Denmark]] and other western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Benz Kotzen and Colin English (1999) ''Environmental Noise Barriers: A Guide to Their Acoustic and Visual Design'', Published by Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|0-419-23180-3}}, 165 pages&lt;/ref&gt; Below, a researcher collects data to calibrate a [[roadway noise]] model for [[County Route G5 (California)|Foothill Expressway]].

[[File:Noisebarrierm.jpg|thumb|290px|Acoustical [[scientist]] measures sound in noise barrier design study, [[Santa Clara County]], California.]]
The best of these early computer models considered the effects of roadway [[geometry]], [[topography]], [[vehicle]] volumes, vehicle speeds, truck mix, [[roadway surface]] type, and micro-[[meteorology]].  Several U.S. research groups developed variations of the computer modeling techniques: [[Caltrans]] Headquarters in [[Sacramento, California]]; the ESL Inc. group in [[Sunnyvale, California]]; the [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]]&lt;ref&gt;John Shadely, ''Acoustical analysis of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] widening project between Raritan and East Brunswick'', Bolt Beranek and Newman, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; group in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and a research team at the [[University of Florida]].  Possibly the earliest published work that scientifically designed a specific noise barrier was the study for the Foothill Expressway in [[Los Altos, California]].&lt;ref&gt;C.M. Hogan and Harry Seidman, ''Design of Noise Abatement Structures along Foothill Expressway, [[Los Altos, California]]'', [[Santa Clara County]] Department of Public Works, [[ESL Inc.]], [[Sunnyvale, California]], October, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous case studies across the U.S. soon addressed dozens of different existing and planned highways.  Most were commissioned by state highway departments and conducted by one of the four research groups mentioned above. The U.S. [[National Environmental Policy Act]]&lt;ref&gt;* U.S. [[National Environmental Policy Act]], enacted January 1, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; effectively mandated the quantitative analysis of [[noise pollution]] from every [[Federal-Aid Highway Act]] Project in the country, propelling noise barrier model development and application.  With passage of the [[Noise Control Act|Noise Control Act of 1972]],&lt;ref&gt;Public Law No. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234 (1972)Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, codification amended at 42 U.S.C. 4901-4918 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; demand for noise barrier design soared from a host of [[noise regulation]] spinoff.

By the late 1970s, more than a dozen research groups in the U.S. were applying similar [[computer model]]ing technology and addressing at least 200 different locations for noise barriers each year. As of 2006, this technology is considered a standard in the evaluation of [[noise pollution]] from highways. The nature and accuracy of the [[computer model]]s used is nearly identical to the original 1970s versions of the technology.

==Design==
The acoustical science of noise barrier design is based upon treating an airway or railway as a [[line source]].{{dubious|date=January 2017}}&lt;!--surely the correct model would be point sources moving along a curvilinear path--&gt; The theory is based upon blockage of sound ray travel toward a particular [[Sensory receptor|receptor]]; however, [[diffraction]] of sound must be addressed. [[Sound waves]] bend (downward) when they pass an edge, such as the apex of a noise barrier. Barriers that block line of sight of a highway or other source will therefore block more sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PublicResourceOrg|title=Highway Noise Barrier Design|date=2010-07-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZcvlCpuD8I&amp;index=3&amp;list=PL9BADB8ACC34C0404|accessdate=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further complicating matters is the phenomenon of [[refraction]], the bending of sound rays in the presence of an [[wiktionary:heterogeneous|inhomogeneous]] [[atmosphere]]. [[Wind shear]] and [[thermocline]] produce such inhomogeneities. The sound sources modeled must include [[engine]] noise, [[tire]] noise, and [[aerodynamic]] noise, all of which vary by vehicle type and speed.

The noise barrier may be constructed on private land, on a public [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]], or on other public land. Because sound levels are measured using a [[logarithmic scale]], a reduction of nine [[decibel]]s is equivalent to elimination of approximately 86 percent of the unwanted sound power.

[[File:noisercrazorback.jpg|thumb|right|310px|Noise barrier earth berm along [[California State Route 12]], [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]], California]]

=== Materials ===
Several different materials may be used for sound barriers. These materials can include masonry, earthwork (such as earth [[berm]]), steel, concrete, wood, plastics, insulating wool, or composites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/noise/noise_barriers/design_construction/design/design04.cfm|title=4. Noise Barrier Types - Design - Design Construction - Noise Barriers - Noise - Environment|publisher=U.S. [[Federal Highway Administration]]|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walls that are made of absorptive material mitigate sound differently than hard surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Reflective and Non-reflective Highway Barriers K. Polcak (MD, SHA) and R.J. Peppin (Scantek, Inc.)  case study: Reflective and Non-Reflective Highway Barriers MD SHA) TRB ADC 40 Summer Meeting, Denver, CO&lt;/ref&gt; It is now also possible to make noise barriers with active materials such as solar [[photovoltaic]] panels to generate electricity while also reducing traffic noise. &lt;ref&gt; S. R. Wadhawan &amp; J. M. Pearce,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117308584 Power and energy potential of mass-scale photovoltaic noise barrier deployment: A case study for the U.S.] ''Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews'' 80, pp. 125–132, (2017).   doi:10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.223   [https://www.academia.edu/33259496/Power_and_Energy_Potential_of_Mass-Scale_Photovoltaic_Noise_Barrier_Deployment_A_Case_Study_for_the Open access]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.ecowatch.com/solar-powered-noise-barriers-quiet-traffic-while-generating-electricit-1882082739.html &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.treehugger.com/solar-technology/solar-power-generating-noise-barriers-go-netherlands.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A wall with porous surface material and sound-dampening content material can be absorptive where little or no noise is reflected back towards the source or elsewhere. Hard surfaces such as masonry or concrete are considered to be reflective where most of the noise is reflected back towards the noise source and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;[[Federal Highway Administration]] "Highway Traffic Noise" 6/05&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise barriers can be effective tools for [[noise pollution]] abatement, but certain locations and topographies are not suitable for use of noise barriers. Cost and [[aesthetics]] also play a role in the choice of noise barriers. In some cases, a roadway is surrounded by a noise abatement structure or dug into a tunnel using the [[cut-and-cover]] method.

==Tradeoffs==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Geluidscherm Overschie.jpg|thumb|right|310px|This noise abatement wall in The Netherlands has a transparent section at the driver's eye-level to reduce the visual impact for road users.]]

Potential disadvantages of noise barriers include:

* Aesthetic impacts for motorists and neighbors, particularly if scenic vistas are blocked&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sccmo.org/DocumentCenter/View/4442|title=Noise Walls|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Costs of design, construction, and maintenance
* Necessity to design custom drainage that the barrier may interrupt

Normally, the benefits of noise reduction far outweigh aesthetic impacts for residents protected from unwanted sound. These benefits include lessened [[sleep disturbance]], improved ability to enjoy outdoor life, reduced [[speech interference level|speech interference]], [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] reduction, reduced risk of [[hearing impairment]], and a reduction in the elevated [[blood pressure]] created by noise (that improves [[cardiovascular]] health).

Sound barrier walls vary in cost depending on the type and quality.  Concrete is popular due to lower cost. Since they are reflective, they could potentially create noise for those across from the barrier.  Absorptive barriers absorb, and thus abate the noise more effectively, but cost more as they are often custom built and are composed of a variety of materials that allow for [[absorption (acoustics)|absorption]].  With regard to [[berm]] construction costs, a major factor is the availability of excess soil in the immediate area which could be used for berm construction. If the soil is present, it is often cheaper to construct an earth berm noise barrier than to haul away the excess dirt, provided there is sufficient land area available for berm construction. Generally a four-to-one ratio of berm cross sectional width to height is required. Thus, for example, to build a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} berm, one needs an available width of {{convert|24|ft|m}}.

==Effects on pollution==

Roadside noise barriers have been shown to reduce the near-road air pollution [[concentration]] levels. Within 15–50 m from the roadside, air pollution concentration levels at the [[Windward and leeward|lee side]] of the noise barriers may be reduced by up to 50% compared to open road values.&lt;ref&gt;Bowker et al., 2007; Baldauf et al., 2008; Heist et al., 2009; Ning et al., 2010; Finn et al., 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Noise barriers force the pollution plumes coming from the road to move up and over the barrier creating the effect of an elevated source and enhancing vertical [[Dispersive mass transfer|dispersion]] of the plume. The deceleration and the deflection of the initial flow by the noise barrier force the plume to disperse horizontally. A highly [[Turbulence|turbulent]] [[Wind shear|shear]] zone characterized by slow velocities and a re-circulation cavity is created in the lee of the barrier which further enhances the dispersion; this mixes ambient air with the pollutants downwind behind the barrier.&lt;ref&gt;Bowker, G.E., Baldauf, R., Isakov, V., Khlystov, A., and Petersen, W. (2007). The effects of roadside structures on the transport and dispersion of ultrafine particles from highways. Atmos. Environ. 41, 8128–8139&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6243">'''Performance Writing''' was pioneered at [[Dartington College of Arts]] in [[Devon|Devon, UK]] as a radical new approach to writing. It is a multi-modal approach which explores through artistic practice how [[writing]] interacts with other art forms and practices — [[visual art]], [[sound art]], [[video art|time-based media]], [[installation art|installation]], [[electronic literature]], [[Artist's book|bookworks]], and [[performance art]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pages/Performance-Writing/446221925633?v=info&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Performance Writing was inaugurated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] undergraduate course at [[Dartington College of Arts]] in 1994. The course was written, and the field developed, by a number of self-described Performance Writers and academics including John Hall, Ric Allsopp, [[Caroline Bergvall]], Aaron Williamson, Brigid Mc Leer, Alaric Sumner, [[Redell Olsen]], [[cris cheek]], Peter Jager, Barbara Bridger, Melanie Thompson, Jerome Fletcher, and many others, and enriched by an program of visiting artists from around the world.&lt;ref name="hall-thirteen"&gt;John Hall, ''Thirteen Ways of Talking about Performance Writing: a Lecture'', Plymouth, UK: Plymouth College of Art Press, 2007. (A more extensive list of performance writers is given on p.35.)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the merger of DCA and [[University College Falmouth]] ( now [[Falmouth University]] in 2010, the undergraduate Performance Writing course was relocated to a new performance centre at Tremough Campus (now [[Penryn Campus]]) near [[Penryn, Cornwall]]. The course ceased taking applications for new students from 2010 onwards pending a reconfiguration of its Performance Writing courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/136/courses-ceasing-entry-57/undergraduate-courses-489/performance-writing-bahons-2117.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013037/http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/136/courses-ceasing-entry-57/undergraduate-courses-489/performance-writing-bahons-2117.html |archivedate=2011-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment has not resumed.

The [[Falmouth University]] post-graduate [[Master of Arts]] course in Performance Writing led by Associate Professor of Performance Writing Jerome Fletcher ran for two years at the [[Arnolfini]] in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.falmouth.ac.uk/201/courses-7/postgraduate-courses-43/performance-writing-ma-1688.html&lt;/ref&gt; Recruitment to the MA Performance Writing was ceased in 2012. Performance Writing continues at the postgraduate and research level at [[Falmouth University]].

The democratic, inclusive, and above all extensible nature of Performance Writing methodology has led to its adoption and adaptation by both independent and academic researchers, practitioners, pedagogs, and institutions in places as far flung as Oakland, California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jacket2.org/commentary/what-performance-writing|title= What is performance writing? |publisher=Jacket2|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Banff Centre]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banffcentre.ca//programs/program.aspx?id=1393|title=In(ter)ventions: Literary Practice at the Edge|publisher=The Banff Centre|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, Performance Writing methodologies and sensibilities have spread – primarily through graduates of the program at Dartington – into a rich diversity of artistic forms and institutional formulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://luckysoap.com/lapsuslinguae/2013/07/writing-on-writing-on-performance-writing/|title=Writing on Writing on Performance Writing |publisher=J. R. Carpenter|accessdate=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of definition==
As an emerging field, its definition and limits are the subject of ongoing debate. John Hall's lecture ''Thirteen Ways of Talking about Performance Writing'', explores [[definition]] as a process, using playful and precise language to establish the complexity of reflexive descriptions: a performance of writing about writing as such.&lt;ref name="hall-thirteen" /&gt;

At the symposium launching the field, Performance Writing was described by Caroline Bergvall as exploring "relationships between textual and text-based work when developed in conjunction with other media and discourses.", and opening "the investigation of formal and ideological strategies which writers and artists develop textually in response or in reaction to their own time and their own fields"&lt;ref name="bergvall-keynote"&gt;Caroline Bergvall, [http://www.carolinebergvall.com/content/text/BERGVALL-KEYNOTE.pdf Keynote Paper for Performance Writing Symposium], Dartington, U.K. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

She also understood it as "not primarily [a] unified academic discipline [or] one delineated, hybridic artform", but rather as an "area of joint practical and critical investigation of the many uses writing and language are being put to and push themselves into."&lt;ref name="bergvall-keynote" /&gt;

==Events==
Performance Writing events so far include two symposia; one at Dartington College of Arts in 1996 and a second at the Theatre School in Utrecht in 1999.

In May 2010 Bristol's [[Arnolfini]], in collaboration with University College Falmouth, held ''PW10'': a weekend of Performance Writing themed talks, readings, and artistic works exploring [[interdisciplinary]] approaches to language and [[textuality]]. It was timed to coincide with the exhibition ''Say: "Parsley"'' by Performance Writing co-founder [[Caroline Bergvall]] and Ciaran Maher. It included works by [[Allen Fisher]], [[Drew Milne]], [[David Prior (artist)]], [[Jason Nelson]], [[J.R. Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/live/details/625 Arnolfini Programme 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302211816/http://www.arnolfini.org.uk/whatson/live/details/625 |date=2010-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 PW12 was held at [[Arnolfini]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4885">'''Phosphate-buffered saline''' (abbreviated '''PBS''') is a [[buffer solution]] commonly used in [[biology|biological research]]. It is a water-based salt solution containing [[disodium hydrogen phosphate]], [[sodium chloride]] and, in some formulations, [[potassium chloride]] and [[potassium dihydrogen phosphate]]. The buffer helps to maintain a constant pH. The [[osmolarity]] and ion concentrations of the solutions match those of the human body ([[tonicity|isotonic]]).

==Applications==
PBS has many uses because it is isotonic and non-toxic to most cells. These uses include substance dilution and cell container rinsing. PBS with [[EDTA]] is also used to disengage attached and clumped cells. [[Divalent metal]]s such as [[zinc]], however, cannot be added as this will result in precipitation.  For these types of applications, [[Good's buffers]] are recommended.

==Preparation==
There are many different ways to prepare PBS solutions (one of them is [[Renato Dulbecco|Dulbecco's]] phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), which has a lower phosphate concentration than standard PBS&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hlRSvfNFRc ''Difference between phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS)]&lt;/ref&gt;). Some formulations do not contain potassium and magnesium, while other ones contain calcium and/or magnesium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dulbecco | first1 = R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1954 | title = Plaque formation and isolation of pure lines with poliomyelitis viruses | url = | journal = J.

Start with 800 mL of distilled water to dissolve all salts. Adjust the pH to 7.4 with HCl. Add distilled water to a total volume of 1 liter. The resultant 1x PBS should have a final concentration of 10 mM PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt;, 137 mM NaCl, and 2.7 mM KCl.

'''The pH of PBS is ~7.4.''' When making buffer solutions, it is good practice to always measure the pH directly using a pH meter. If necessary, pH can be adjusted using hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide.

PBS can also be prepared by using commercially made PBS buffer tablets or pouches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicago.se/sites/default/files/pdf/productsheets/PBS_Buffer_v._01.pdf Medicago AB, (2010) Phosphate buffered saline specification sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

If used in cell culturing, the solution can be dispensed into aliquots and sterilized by [[autoclaving]] or [[filtration]]. Sterilization may not be necessary depending on its use. PBS can be stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator. However, concentrated stock solutions may [[precipitate]] when cooled and should be kept at room temperature until precipitate has completely dissolved before use.

In [[music]], a '''reduction''' is an [[arrangement]] or [[transcription (music)|transcription]] of an existing [[sheet music|score]] or [[musical composition|composition]] in which complexity is lessened to make [[musical analysis|analysis]], performance, or practice easier or clearer; the number of [[part (music)|parts]] may be reduced or [[rhythm]] may be simplified, such as through the use of [[block chord]]s.

==Orchestral==

An '''orchestral reduction''' is a [[sheet music]] arrangement of a work originally for full symphony [[orchestra]] (such as a symphony, overture, or opera), rearranged for a single instrument (typically [[piano]] or [[organ (music)|organ]]), a smaller orchestra, or a [[chamber ensemble]] with or without a keyboard (e.g. a [[string quartet]]). A reduction for solo piano is sometimes called a [[#Piano|piano reduction]] or ''piano score''.

During opera rehearsals, a [[répétiteur]] (piano player) will typically read from a piano reduction of the opera. When a choir is learning a work scored for choir and full orchestra, the initial rehearsals will usually be done with a pianist playing a piano reduction of the orchestra part. Before the advent of the [[phonograph]], arrangements of orchestral works for solo piano or [[piano four hands]] were in common use for enjoyment at home.

A reduction for a smaller orchestra or chamber ensemble may be used when not enough players are available, when a venue is too small to accommodate the full orchestra, to accompany less powerful voices, or to save money by hiring fewer players.

==Piano==
&lt;!--[[Piano transcription]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
A '''piano reduction''' or '''piano transcription''' is [[sheet music]] for the [[piano]] (a ''piano score'') that has been compressed and/or simplified so as to fit on a two-line staff and be playable on the piano. It is also considered a style of [[orchestration]] or music [[arrangement]] less well known as ''contraction scoring'', a subset of [[elastic scoring]].

The most notable example is [[Franz Liszt]]'s [[Beethoven Symphonies (Liszt)|transcriptions]] for solo piano of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s symphonies, which are arguably the greatest work of transcription ever completed in the history of music.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Reflections_on_Liszt.html?id=4URhKNWu0XQC&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arnold Schoenberg]], a piano reduction should "only be like the view of a sculpture from ''one'' viewpoint", and he advises that [[timbre]] and [[texture (music)|thickness]] should largely be ignored, since "the attempt to make a useful object equally usable for a variety of purposes is usually the way to spoil it completely".&lt;ref name="The Modern Piano Reduction"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schoenberg |first=Arnold |year=1975 |chapter=The Modern Piano Reduction |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jbXtxJezk5cC&amp;pg=PA348 |title=Style and Idea: Selected Writings of Arnold Schoenberg |pages=348–350 |isbn=978-0-520-05294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Signed distance2.png|right|thumb|A more complicated set (top) and its signed distance function (bottom, in red).]]
In [[mathematics]] and its applications, the '''signed distance function''' (or '''oriented distance function''') of a set ''Ω'' in a [[metric space]] determines the distance of a given point ''x'' from the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of ''Ω'', with the sign determined by whether ''x'' is in ''Ω''. The function has positive values at points ''x'' inside ''Ω'', it decreases in value as ''x'' approaches the boundary of ''Ω'' where the signed distance function is zero, and it takes negative values outside of ''Ω''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1467575 | title=Level set based shape prior segmentation | author1=Chan, T. | author2=Zhu, W. | year=2005 | conference=IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the alternative convention is also sometimes taken instead (i.e., negative inside ''Ω'' and positive outside).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=368173 | title=Shape modeling with front propagation: a level set approach | author1=Malladi, R. | author2=Sethian, J.A. | author3=Vemuri, B.C. | journal=IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence | volume=17 | issue=2 | year=1995 | doi = 10.1109/34.368173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

If ''Ω'' is a subset of a [[metric space]], ''X'', with metric, ''d'', then the ''signed distance function'', ''f'', is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases}
   d(x, \partial \Omega) &amp; \mbox{ if } x\in\Omega \\
  -d(x, \partial \Omega)&amp;  \mbox{ if } x\in\Omega^c
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. For any &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt; d(x, \partial \Omega) := \inf_{y \in \partial \Omega}d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''inf'' denotes the [[infimum]].

==Properties in Euclidean space==

If ''Ω'' is a subset of the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; with [[piecewise]] [[smooth function|smooth]] boundary, then the signed distance function is differentiable [[almost everywhere]], and its [[gradient]] satisfies the [[eikonal equation]]

: &lt;math&gt;|\nabla f|=1.&lt;/math&gt;

If the boundary of ''Ω'' is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; for ''k''≥2 (see [[differentiability classes]]) then ''d'' is ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; on points sufficiently close to the boundary of ''Ω''.{{sfn|Gilbarg|1983|loc=Lemma 14.16}} In particular, '''''on''''' the boundary ''f'' satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x) = N(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the inward normal vector field. The signed distance function is thus a differentiable extension of the normal vector field. In particular, the [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] of the signed distance function on the boundary of ''Ω'' gives the [[Weingarten map]].

If, further, ''Γ'' is a region sufficiently close to the boundary of ''Ω'' that ''f'' is twice continuously differentiable on it, then there is an explicit formula involving the Weingarten map ''W''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; for the Jacobian of changing variables in terms of the signed distance function and nearest boundary point. Specifically, if ''T''(∂''Ω'',''μ'') is the set of points within distance ''μ'' of the boundary of ''Ω'' (i.e. the [[tubular neighbourhood]] of radius ''μ''), and ''g'' is an absolutely integrable function on ''Γ'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{T(\partial\Omega,\mu)} g(x)\,dx = \int_{\partial\Omega}\int_{-\mu}^\mu g(u+\lambda N(u))\, \det(I-\lambda W_u) \,d\lambda \,dS_u,&lt;/math&gt;

where det indicates the [[determinant]] and ''dS''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that we are taking the [[surface integral]].{{sfn|Gilbarg|1983|loc=Equation (14.98)}}

==Algorithms==
[[Algorithm]]s for calculating the signed distance function include the efficient [[fast marching method]], [[fast sweeping method]]&lt;ref&gt;[ZHAO, Hongkai. A fast sweeping method for eikonal equations. Mathematics of Computation, 2005, 74. Jg., Nr. 250, S. 603-627.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the more general [[level-set method]].

== Applications ==
Signed distance functions are applied, for example, in [[computer vision]].

They have also recently been used in a method (advanced by [[Valve Corporation]]) to render [[smooth font]]s at large sizes (or alternatively at [[Pixel density#Named pixel densities|high DPI]]) using [[GPU]] acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1145/1281500.1281665 | title=Improved alpha-tested magnification for vector textures and special effects | journal=ACM SIGGRAPH 2007 courses on - SIGGRAPH '07 | pages=9 | date=2007 | first=Chris | last=Green| isbn=9781450318235 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Valve's method computed signed [[distance field]]s in [[Raster graphics|raster space]] in order to avoid the computational complexity of solving the problem in the (continuous) vector space. More recently piece-wise approximation solutions have been proposed (which for example approximate a Bézier with arc splines), but even this way the computation can be too slow for [[real-time rendering]], and it has to be assisted by grid-based [[discretization]] techniques to approximate (and cull from the computation) the distance to points that are too far away.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tHv6mcIIeo&lt;/ref&gt;

This shows the net movement of water down its potential energy gradient, from highest water potential in the soil to lowest water potential in the air.]]
The '''soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC)''' is the pathway for water moving from [[soil]] through [[plant]]s to the [[atmosphere]]. Continuum in the description highlights the continuous nature of water connection through the pathway. The low [[water potential]] of the atmosphere, and relatively higher (i.e. less negative) water potential inside leaves, leads to a diffusion gradient across the [[Stoma|stomatal]] pores of leaves, drawing water out of the leaves as vapour. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As water vapour [[Transpiration|transpires]] out of the leaf, further water molecules evaporate off the surface of [[Leaf|mesophyll]] cells to replace the lost molecules since water in the air inside leaves is maintained at [[saturation vapour pressure]]. Water lost at the surface of cells is replaced by water from the [[xylem]], which due to the [[Cohesion-tension theory|cohesion-tension]] properties of water in the xylem of plants pulls additional water molecules through the xylem from the roots toward the leaf.  

==Components==
The transport of water along this pathway occurs in components, variously defined among scientific disciplines:
* [[Soil physics]] characterizes [[soil moisture|water in soil]] in terms of [[water potential|tension]], 
* [[Physiology]] of plants and animals characterizes water in organisms in terms of ''diffusion pressure deficit'', and
* [[Meteorology]] uses [[vapour pressure]] or [[relative humidity]] to characterize atmospheric water. 

SPAC integrates these components and is defined as a:
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;...concept recognising that the field with all its components (soil, plant, animals and the ambient atmosphere taken together) constitutes a physically integrated, dynamic system in which the various flow processes involving energy and matter occur simultaneously and independently like links in the chain. &lt;ref&gt; [[John R. Philip]] (1966). Plant water relations: some physical aspects. ''Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol.'' 17, 245–268.&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

This characterises the state of water in different components of the SPAC as expressions of the energy level or [[water potential]] of each. Modelling of water transport between components relies on SPAC, as do studies of water potential gradients between segments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2651">'''Spectrophilia''' is [[sexual attraction]] to [[ghost]]s or [[sexual arousal]] from images in [[mirror]]s, as well as the alleged phenomenon of sexual encounters between [[ghost]]s and [[human]]s.

==Spectrophilia as a fetish==
Spectrophilia is a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] that is classified as the [[paraphilia]] in which one is attracted to ghosts or spirits. Spectrophiliacs fantasize about ghosts and often imagine scenarios involving sexual events between themselves or others and spirits.

==Succubus and Incubus==
In western folklore, the [[succubus]] is a demon or evil spirit who takes on a female human form to seduce men. The succubus most commonly seduces men through intercourse. The succubus is said to take semen from the male for use in impregnating a woman. 

The counterpart of the succubus is the [[incubus]]. The incubus is a demon that is said to take on a male human form. The incubus, much like the succubus, is said to seduce women into sex with the objective of impregnating the woman with its semen.&lt;ref name="csicop1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Stollznow|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/paranormal_paramours |title=CSI &amp;#124; Paranormal Paramours |publisher=Csicop.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that succubi and incubi are spirits or ghosts that have sexual intercourse with men and women classifies the phenomenon as spectrophilia.

==Spectrophilia in folklore==
Many cultures have [[folklore]] involving spirits having sexual relations with humans, including [[Arab culture|Arabic]], [[Greek culture|Greek]], [[Hindu culture|Hindu]], and [[Celts|Celtic]] culture.

==Evidence==
No scientific evidence has been documented on the phenomenon of spectrophilia, though it has become a frequently talked-about subject among [[Ghost hunting|ghost hunters]], including [[Ghost Adventures]] and the [[Travel Channel]]'s show titled ‘Ghostly Lovers’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/Video/who-are-these-ghostly-lovers-11635 |title=Who are these ghostly lovers? : Video |publisher=Travel Channel |date= |accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In modern fiction==
Several films have dealt with the concept, among them ''[[The Entity]]'' (1981), ''[[Ghost_(1990_film)|Ghost]]'' (1990) , Dusk Maiden Of Amnesia (2008) and ''[[It Follows]]'' (2014).

[[Virtual world]]s are playing an increasingly important role in education, especially in [[language learning]]. By March 2007 it was estimated that over 200 universities or academic institutions were involved in [[Second Life]] (Cooke-Plagwitz, p.&amp;nbsp;548).&lt;ref&gt;Cooke-Plagwitz, Jessamine (2008) "New Directions in CALL: An Objective Introduction to Second Life", ''CALICO Journal'' 25, 3: https://www.calico.org/memberBrowse.php?action=article&amp;id=716&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Miller, Linden Lab Vice President of Platform and Technology Development, claimed in 2009 that "Language learning is the most common education-based activity in Second Life".&lt;ref&gt;Team Engage, "8D taps language learners, bots, microtransactions", ''EngageDigital'', 20 May 2009: http://www.engagedigital.com/2009/05/29/out-of-stealth-8d-taps-language-learners-bots-microtransactions/&lt;/ref&gt; Many mainstream language institutes and private language schools are now using 3D [[virtual environment]]s to support language learning.

==History==
[[Virtual worlds]] date back to the adventure games and simulations of the 1970s, for example [[Colossal Cave Adventure]], a text-only simulation in which the user communicated with the computer by typing commands at the keyboard. These early adventure games and simulations led on to [[MUDs]] (Multi-user domains) and [[MOO]]s (Multi-user domains object-oriented), which language teachers were able to exploit for teaching foreign languages and intercultural understanding (Shield 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Shield L. (2003) "MOO as a language learning tool". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three-dimensional virtual worlds such as ''Traveler'' and [[Active Worlds]], both of which appeared in the 1990s, were the next important development. ''Traveler'' included the possibility of audio communication (but not text chat) between avatars represented as disembodied heads in a three-dimensional abstract landscape. Svensson (2003) describes the Virtual Wedding Project, in which advanced students of English made use of ''Active Worlds'' as an arena for constructivist learning.&lt;ref&gt;Svensson P. (2003) "Virtual worlds as arenas for language learning". In Felix U. (ed.) ''Language learning online: towards best practice'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Adobe Atmosphere]] software platform was also used to promote language learning in the Babel-M project (Williams &amp; Weetman 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Williams C. &amp; Weetman C. (2003) Babel-M: A virtual environment for the promotion of language learning, [http://www.parapal-online.co.uk/prof/atmosphere_design.html ''Paragraph PAL''], 23 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3D world of [[Second Life]] was launched in 2003. Initially perceived as another [[role-playing game]] (RPG), it began to attract the attention of language teachers. 2005 saw the first large-scale language school, [[Languagelab.com]], open its doors in Second Life. By 2007, Languagelab.com's custom [[VoIP]] (audio communication) solution was integrated with Second Life. Prior to that, teachers and students used separate applications for voice chat.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Erard M. (2007) "A Boon to Second Life Language Schools: New Technology will Allow High-Quality Audio in a Virtual World", ''Technology Review'', 10 April 2007: http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18510/page1/&lt;/ref&gt;

Many universities, such as Monash University,&lt;ref&gt;Monash University: http://www.monash.edu.au/international/dvc/virtualworlds/monashsecondlife.html&lt;/ref&gt; and language institutes, such as [[British Council|The British Council]], [[Confucius Institute]], [[Instituto Cervantes]] and the Goethe-Institut,&lt;ref&gt;Goethe-Institut: http://www.goethe.de/frm/sec/enindex.htm&lt;/ref&gt; have islands in Second Life specifically for language learning. Many professional and research organisations support virtual world language learning through their activities in Second Life. [[EUROCALL]] and [[CALICO (consortium)|CALICO]], two leading professional associations that promote language learning with the aid of new technologies, maintain a joint Virtual Worlds Special Interest Group (VW SIG) and a headquarters in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;EUROCALL/CALICO Virtual Worlds SIG: http://virtualworldssig.ning.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent examples of creating sims in virtual worlds specifically for language education include VIRTLANTIS, which has been a free resource for language learners and teachers and an active community of practice since 2006,&lt;ref&gt;VIRTLANTIS: Free Virtual World Language Learning - Come speak with the world!: http://www.virtlantis.com&lt;/ref&gt; the EU-funded NIFLAR project,&lt;ref&gt;Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research (NIFLAR): http://niflar.ning.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930093225/http://niflar.ning.com/ |date=30 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the EU-funded AVALON project,&lt;ref&gt;Access to Virtual and Action Learning live ONline (AVALON): http://avalon-project.ning.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and the EduNation Islands, which have been set up as a community of educators aiming to provide information about and facilities for language learning and teaching.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;EduNation Islands wiki: http://edunation-islands.wikispaces.com/&lt;/ref&gt; NIFLAR is implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]].&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;NIFLAR (Networked Interaction in Foreign Language Acquisition and Research): http://niflar.ning.com/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930093225/http://niflar.ning.com/ |date=30 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous other examples are described by Molka-Danielsen &amp; Deutschmann (2009),&lt;ref&gt;Molka-Danielsen J. &amp; Deutschmann M. (eds.) (2009) ''Learning and teaching in the virtual world of Second Life'', Tapir Academic Press, Trondheim, Norway.&lt;/ref&gt; and Walker, Davies &amp; Hewer (2012).&lt;ref&gt;Walker R., Davies G. &amp; Hewer S. (2012) Introduction to the Internet. Section 14.2.1 (Second Life) of Module 1.5 in Davies G. (ed.) ''Information and Communications Technology for Language Teachers (ICT4LT)'', Slough, Thames Valley University [Online]: http://www.ict4lt.org/en/en_mod1-5.htm#secondlife&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007 a series of conferences known as SLanguages have taken place, bringing together practitioners and researchers in the field of language education in Second Life for a 24-hour event to celebrate languages and cultures within the 3D virtual world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slanguages.net/home.php|title=slanguages.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the decline of second life due to increasing support for open source platforms&lt;ref&gt;Karlov, Maria (2012) "OpenSim gains record-breaking 2,177 regions",http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/09/opensim-gains-record-breaking-2177-regions/&lt;/ref&gt; many independent language learning grids such as English Grid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://englishgrid.com|title=keating.me Secure Email|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Chatterdale&lt;ref&gt;Trombly, Anastasiahave (2012): http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/05/virtual-worlds-offer-variety-less-stress-for-language-learners/&lt;/ref&gt; have emerged.

==Approaches to language education in virtual worlds==
Almost all virtual world educational projects envisage a [[blended learning]] approach whereby the language learners are exposed to a 3D virtual environment for a specific activity or time period.  Such approaches may combine the use of virtual worlds with other online and offline tools, such as 2D virtual learning environments (e.g. [[Moodle]]) or physical classrooms. SLOODLE. for example, is an open-source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environments of Second Life and/or [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]] with the Moodle learning-management system.&lt;ref&gt;SLOODLE is a free and open source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environments of Second Life and/or OpenSim with the Moodle learning-management system: http://www.sloodle.org/moodle/&lt;/ref&gt; Some language schools offer a complete language learning environment through a virtual world, e.g. [[Languagelab.com]] and [http://www.avatarlanguages.com/home.php Avatar Languages].

Virtual worlds such as Second Life are used for the [[immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Canfield |title=Using Immersive Learning Environments in Foreign Language Classes: Second Life |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jessamine |last=Cooke-Plagwitz |title=Conversing in the Metaverse: Language Teaching and Learning in Second Life |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and task-based, game-like&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Chan |title=Developing a Meaning-focused and Task-based Virtual Learning Reality |url=https://www.calico.org/p-398-%20..html |work= Paper presented at CALICO 2008 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; opportunities they offer language learners.  As such, virtual world language learning can be considered to offer distinct (although combinable) learning experiences.

* '''Immersive''': Immersive experiences draw on the ability to be surrounded by a certain (real or fictitious) environment that can stimulate language learning.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery A. &amp; Collins, M. (2008). Immersive Learning and Role Plays in Second Life. In K. McFerrin et al. (Eds.), Proceedings of Society for Information Technology &amp; Teacher Education International Conference 2008 (pp. 2628-2632). Chesapeake, VA: AACE: Retrieved from http://www.editlib.org/p/27616, 2011-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Social''': Almost all 3D virtual spaces are inherently social environments where language learners can meet others, either to informally practice a language or to participate in more formal classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Laurence |last=Johnson|title=Virtual Worlds: Inherently Immersive, Highly Social Learning Spaces |url=http://immersiveeducation.org/library/Immersive_Learning-Johnson_and_Levine.pdf |work=The Immersive Education Initiative |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Creative''': A less-developed approach to language learning in virtual worlds is that of constructing objects as part of a language learning activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gavin |last=Dudeney |title=A Coffee with Gavin Dudeney |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLpb7f06LmI |work= Recording of live event at EduNation in Second Life |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is currently little documentation of such activities.

===Six learnings framework===
The "Six learnings framework" is a pedagogical outline developed for virtual world education in general. It sets out six possible ways to view an educational activity.&lt;ref&gt;Lim K. (2009) "Pedagogy, Education and Innovation in 3-D Virtual Worlds", '' Journal of Virtual Worlds Research 2,1'': http://journals.tdl.org/jvwr/article/view/424/466&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Exploring''': learners explore a virtual world's locations and communities as fieldwork for class.
* '''Collaborating''': learners work together within a virtual world on collaborative tasks.
* '''Being''': learners explore themselves and their identity through their presence in a virtual world, such as through role-play.
* '''Building''': learners construct objects within a virtual world.
* '''Championing''': learners promote real life causes through activities and presentations in a virtual world.
* '''Expressing''': learners represent activities within a virtual world to the outside world, through blogs, podcasts, presentations and videos.

===Learning in 3D worlds===
*''The 7 Sensibilities of Virtual Worlds for Learning'' presentation by Karl Kapp and Tony O'Driscoll illustrates how a 3D environment makes learning fundamentally different.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl &amp; O'Driscoll, Tony (2010) ''The 7 Sensibilities of Virtual Worlds for Learning'', Webinar presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3amL-BXZRk&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''3D Virtual Worlds Learning Archetypes'' presentation by Karl Kapp and Tony O'Driscoll describes 14 archetypes of how people learn in virtual worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl &amp; O'Driscoll, Tony (2010) ''14 archetypes of how people learn in virtual worlds'', Webinar presentation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNjV8Fvre4U&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivist approaches===
3D virtual worlds are often used for [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] learning because of the opportunities for learners to explore, collaborate and be immersed within an environment of their choice.  Some virtual worlds allow users to build objects and to change the appearance of their avatar and of their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tuncer |last=Can |title=Learning and Teaching Languages Online: a Constructivist Approach |url=http://www.novitasroyal.org/Vol_3_1/can.pdf |work=Novitas-ROYAL |date=April 2009 |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivist approaches such as [[#Task-based language learning|task-based language learning]] and [[#Dogme language teaching|Dogme]] are applied to virtual world language learning because of the scope for learners to socially co-construct knowledge, in spheres of particular relevance to the learner.

===Task-based language learning===
[[Task-based language learning]] (TBLL) has been commonly applied to virtual world language education. Task-based language learning focuses on the use of authentic language and encourages students to do real life tasks using the language being learned.&lt;ref&gt;Nunan D. (2004) ''Task-based language teaching'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Tasks can be highly transactional, where the student is carrying out everyday tasks such as visiting the doctor at the Chinese Island of Monash University in Second Life. Incidental knowledge about the medical system in China and cultural information can also be gained at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Island is an initiative by the Chinese Studies Program at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia designed to compliment traditional classroom-based learning with context-based, hands on learning in the virtual environment of Second Life: http://www.virtualhanyu.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tasks may focus on more interactional language, such as those that involve more social activities or interviews within a virtual world.

===Dogme language teaching===
[[Dogme language teaching]] is an approach that is essentially communicative, focusing mainly on conversation between learners and teacher rather than conventional textbooks. Although Dogme is perceived by some teachers as being anti-technology, it nevertheless appears to be particularly relevant to virtual world language learning because of the social, immersive and creative experiences offered by virtual worlds and the opportunities they offer for authentic communication and a learner-centred approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Vickers |title=Dogme 2.0: What "Teaching 2.0" Can Learn from Dogme ELT |url=http://www.avatarlanguages.com/blog/dogme-elt-web20-dogme20 |work= Avatar Languages Blog |date=2009-03-15 |accessdate = 2009-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WebQuests===
Virtual world WebQuests (also referred to as SurReal Quests&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Howard |last=Vickers |title=SurReal Quests: Enriched, purposeful language learning in Second Life |url=http://kt.flexiblelearning.net.au/tkt2007/edition-15/surreal-quests-enriched-purposeful-language-learning-in-second-life |work=The Knowledge Tree |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2009-06-22 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605045109/http://kt.flexiblelearning.net.au/tkt2007/edition-15/surreal-quests-enriched-purposeful-language-learning-in-second-life/ |archive-date=5 June 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) combine the concept of 2D WebQuests with the immersive and social experiences of 3D virtual worlds.  Learners develop texts, audios or podcasts based on their research, part of which is within a virtual world.

===Language villages===
The concept of real-life [[English village|language villages]] has been replicated within virtual worlds to create a language immersion environment for language learners in their own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ton |last=Koenraad |title=How can 3D Virtual Worlds contribute to language education? |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/71947093/worldcallpdf-2 |work= Paper presented at WorldCALL 2008 |accessdate = 2011-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch Digitale School has built two virtual language villages, Chatterdale (English) and Parolay (French), for secondary education students on the OpenSim grid.&lt;ref&gt;3DLES (3D Learning Experience Services): http://www.3dles.com/en/projects.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virtual classrooms===
Hundsberger (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;18)&lt;ref&gt;Hundsberger S. (2009) ''Foreign language learning in Second Life and the implications for resource provision in academic libraries'', Arcadia Fellowship Programme, Cambridge University Library: http://arcadiaproject.lib.cam.ac.uk/docs/second_life.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; defines a virtual classroom thus:

"A virtual classroom in SL sets itself apart from other virtual classrooms in that an ordinary classroom is the place to learn a language whereas the SL virtual classroom is the place to practise a language. The connection to the outside world from a language lab is a 2D connection, but increasingly people enjoy rich and dynamic 3D environments such as SL as can be concluded from the high number of UK universities active in SL."

To what extent a virtual classroom should offer only language practice rather than teaching a language as in a real-life classroom is a matter for debate. Hundsberger's view (p.&amp;nbsp;18) is that "[...] SL classrooms are not viewed as a replacement for real life classrooms. SL classrooms are an additional tool to be used by the teacher/learner."

===Virtual tourism===
Language learning can take place in public spaces within virtual worlds. This offers greater flexibility with locations and students can choose the locations themselves, which enables a more constructivist approach.

The wide variety of replica places in Second Life, e.g. Barcelona, Berlin, London and Paris, offers opportunities for language learning through virtual tourism. Students can engage in conversation with native speakers who people these places, take part in conducted tours in different languages and even learn how to use Second Life in a language other than English.

The Hypergrid Adventurers Club is an open group of explorers who discuss and visit many different OpenSim virtual worlds. By using ''hypergrid'' connectivity, avatars can jump between completely different OpenSim grids while maintaining a singular identity and inventory.&lt;ref&gt;Hypergrid Adventurers Club: http://becunningandfulloftricks.com/hypergrid-adventurers-club/&lt;/ref&gt;

The TAFE NSW-Western Institute Virtual Tourism Project commenced in 2010 and was funded by the Australian Flexible Learning Framework's eLearning Innovations Project. It is focused on developing virtual worlds learning experiences for TVET Tourism students and located on the joycadiaGrid.&lt;ref&gt;TAFE-NSW Virtual Tourism Project: http://jokaydia.com/2010/07/20/wit-jokaydiagrid/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autonomous learning===
Virtual worlds offer exceptional opportunities for [[Self-paced instruction|autonomous learning]]. The video ''Language learning in Second Life: an Introduction'' by Helen Myers (Karelia Kondor in SL) is a good illustration of an adult learner's experiences of her introduction to SL and in learning Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Myers H. ''Language learning in Second Life: an Introduction'': http://kareliakondor.blip.tv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tandem learning (buddy learning)===
[[Tandem learning]], or buddy learning, takes autonomous learning one step further. This form of learning involves two people with different native languages working together as a pair in order to help one another to improve their language skills.&lt;ref&gt;Little D. (2001) "Learner autonomy and the challenge of tandem language learning via the Internet". In Chambers A. &amp; Davies G. (eds.) ''Information and Communications Technology: a European perspective'', Lisse: Swets &amp; Zeitlinger&lt;/ref&gt; Each partner helps the other through explanations in the foreign language. As this form of learning is based on communication between members of different language communities and cultures, it also facilitates [[intercultural learning]]. A tandem learning group, Teach You Teach Me (Language Buddies), can be found in Second Life.

===Holodecks===
The term [[holodeck]] derives from the ''Star Trek'' TV series and feature films, in which a holodeck is depicted as an enclosed room in which simulations can be created for training or entertainment. Holodecks offer exciting possibilities of calling up a range of instantly available simulations that can be used for entertainment, presentations, conferencing and, of course, teaching and learning. For example, if students of hospitality studies are being introduced to the language used in checking in at a hotel a simulation of a hotel reception area can be generated instantly by selecting the chosen simulation from a holodeck ''rezzer'', a device that stores and generates different scenarios. Holodecks can also be used to encourage students to describe a scene or to even build a scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nergiz |last=Kern |title=Holodecks and language learning |url=http://slexperiments.edublogs.org/2009/04/22/holodecks-and-language-learning  |work=Teaching in Second Life - Reflections of a language teacher |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate = 2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Holodecks are commonly used for a range of role-plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Kenneth |last=Lim |title=Pedagogy, Education and Innovation in 3-D Virtual Worlds |url=http://journals.tdl.org/jvwr/article/view/424/466 |work= Journal of Virtual Worlds Research |date=April 2009 |accessdate = 2011-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CAVE technology===
A [[cave automatic virtual environment]] (CAVE) is an immersive virtual reality (VR) environment where projectors are directed to three, four, five or six of the walls of a room-sized cube. The CAVE is a large theatre that sits in a larger room. The walls of the CAVE are made up of rear-projection screens, and the floor is made of a down-projection screen. High-resolution projectors display images on each of the screens by projecting the images onto mirrors which reflect the images onto the projection screens. The user will go inside the CAVE wearing special glasses to allow the 3D graphics that are generated by the CAVE to be seen. With these glasses, people using the CAVE can actually see objects floating in the air, and can walk around them, getting a realistic view of what the object would look like when they walk around it.

O'Brien, Levy &amp; Orich (2009) describe the viability of CAVE and PC technology as environments for assisting students to learn a foreign language and to experience the target culture in ways that are impossible through the use of other technologies.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, M., Levy R. &amp; Orich, A. (2009) "Virtual Immersion: The Role of CAVE and PC Technology", ''CALICO Journal'' 26, 2: https://www.calico.org/memberBrowse.php?action=article&amp;id=746&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice chat===
Earlier virtual worlds, with the exception of ''Traveler'' (1996), offered only text chat. Voice chat was a later addition.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Kathleen (2006) "Voice Chat Comes to Online Games", ''Wired'', 7 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Second Life did not introduce voice capabilities until 2007. Prior to this, independent [[VoIP]] systems, e.g. [[Ventrilo]], were used. Second Life's current internal voice system has the added ability to reproduce the effect of distance on voice loudness, so that there is an auditory sense of space amongst users.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Other virtual worlds, such as ''[[Twinity]]'', also offer internal voice systems. Browser-based 3D virtual environments tend to only offer text-chat communication, although voice chat seems likely to become more widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Seiler, Joey (2009) "Vivox Launches Toolbar For Browser-Based Voice Chat", ''EngageDigital'', 18 March 2009: http://www.engagedigital.com/blog/2009/03/18/vivox-launches-toolbar-for-browserbased-voice-chat/&lt;/ref&gt; Vivox&lt;ref&gt;Vivox online communications services: http://www.vivox.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the leading integrated voice platform for the social web, providing a Voice Toolbar for developers of virtual worlds and multiplayer games. Vivox is now spreading into OpenSim at an impressive rate, e.g. Avination is offering in-world Vivox voice at no charge to its residents and region renters, as well as to customers who host private grids with the company.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2011) "Avination first with Vivox voice on OpenSim", ''Hypergrid Business'', 11 March 2011: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2011/03/avination-first-opensim-grid-to-offer-vivox-voice/&lt;/ref&gt; English Grid began offering language learning and voice chat for language learners using Vivox in May, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2011)"English learning grid launched" May 7, 2012: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2012/05/english-learning-grid-launched/&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of voice chat in Second Life in 2007 was a major breakthrough. Communicating with one's voice is the ''sine qua non'' of language learning and teaching, but voice chat is not without its problems. Many Second Life users report on difficulties with voice chat, e.g. the sound being too soft, too loud or non-existent – or continually breaking up. This may be due to glitches in the Second Life software itself, but it is often due to individual users' poor understanding of how to set up audio on their computers and/or of inadequate bandwidth. A separate voice chat channel outside Second Life, e.g. [[Skype]], may in such cases offer a solution.

==Owning and renting land in virtual worlds==
Owning or renting land in a virtual world is necessary for educators who wish to create learning environments for their students. Educators can then use the land to create permanent structures or temporary structures embedded within [[#Holodecks|holodecks]], for example the EduNation Islands in Second Life.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The land can also be used for students undertaking building activities. Students may also use public sandboxes, but they may prefer to exhibit their creations more permanently on owned or rented land.

Some language teaching projects, for example NIFLAR, may be implemented both in Second Life and in [[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

The Immersive Education Initiative revealed (October 2010) that it would provide free permanent virtual world land in OpenSim for one year to every school and non-profit organization that has at least one teacher, administrator, or student in attendance of any Immersive Education Initiative Summit.&lt;ref&gt;Korolov, Maria (2010) "Initiative: free land for educators migrating from Second Life", ''Hypergrid Business'', 15 October 2010:

==Alternative 3D worlds==
Many islands in Second Life have language- or culture-specific communities that offer language learners easy ways to practise a foreign language (Berry 2009).&lt;ref&gt;Berry C. D (2009) [http://news.rutgers.edu/focus/issue.2009-04-06.1814922901/article.2009-04-07.1692917645 "Virtual reality and high-tech simulations breathe second life into language classes"], ''Focus'', Rutgers University: USA, NJ. Retrieved 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Second Life is the widest-used 3D world among members of the language teaching community, but there are many alternatives. General-purpose virtual environments such as Hangout and browser-based 3D environments such as ExitReality and 3DXplorer offer 3D spaces for social learning, which may also include language learning. [[Google Street View]] and [[Google Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Language Resource Center at UNC Charlotte |title=Google Earth Activities for Foreign Language Classes |url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2496396767023982994&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=true |work=Presentation at Instructional Technology Showcase |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate = 2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; also have a role to play in language learning and teaching.

''Twinity'' replicates the real life cities of Berlin, Singapore, London and Miami, and offers language learners virtual locations with specific languages being spoken. Zon has been created specifically for learners of Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Zon: A multiplayer, online learning environment designed to teach Chinese language and culture through gameplay: http://enterzon.com/&lt;/ref&gt; English Grid&lt;ref&gt;English Grid: http://englishgrid.com&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed by education and training professionals as a research platform for delivering English language instruction using opensim.

[[OpenSimulator|OpenSim]] is employed as free open source standalone software, thus enabling a decentralized configuration of all educators, trainers, and users. Scott Provost, Director at the Free Open University, Washington DC, writes: "The advantage of Standalone is that Asset server and Inventory server are local on the same server and well connected to your sim. With Grids that is never the case. With Grids/Clouds that is never the case. On OSGrid with 5,000 regions and hundreds of users scalability problems are unavoidable. We plan on proposing 130,000 Standalone mega regions (in US schools) with Extended UPnP Hypergrid services. The extended services would include a suitcase or limited assets that would be live on the client".&lt;ref&gt;Immersive Worlds Tool Ranking: http://immersive-worlds-tool-ranking.grouply.com/message/474&lt;/ref&gt; Such a standalone sim offers 180,000 prims for building, and can be distributed pre-configured together with a virtual world viewer using a USB storage stick or SD card. Pre-configured female and male avatars can also be stored on the stick, or even full-sim builds can be downloaded for targeted audiences without virtual world experience. This is favorable for introductory users who want a sandbox on demand and have no clue how to get started.

There is no shortage of choices of virtual world platforms. The following lists describe a variety of different virtual world platforms, their features and their target audiences:

==Virtual world conferences==
*The first SLanguages conference took place on 23 June 2007. The SLanguages conference is now a free annual 24-hours event, bringing together practitioners and researchers in the field of language education in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;SLanguages: A series of annual conferences for language teachers in Second Life: http://www.slanguages.net/home.php&lt;/ref&gt;
*SL Experiments is a group managed by Nergiz Kern (Daffodil Fargis in Second Life) for collecting and sharing ideas on how to use Second Life for teaching foreign languages. The group meets twice a month in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;SL Experiments: A group of language teachers interested in or already teaching in Second Life: http://slexperiments.pbworks.com/w/page/11306631/FrontPage&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual Round Table conference takes place twice a year, focusing on language teaching technologies. A substantial part of the conference takes place in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Round Table: A semi-annual live online conference on language learning technologies: http://www.virtual-round-table.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual Worlds Best Practices in Education (VWBPE) is a global grass-roots community event focusing on education in immersive 3D environments.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Worlds Best Practices in Education (VWBPE): http://www.vwbpe.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual Worlds Education Roundtable (VWER) group meets each week to talk about issues that concern educators with regard to using virtual worlds as a teaching and learning tool.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual Worlds Education Roundtable (VWER): http://www.vwer.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Immersive Education Initiative (iED) Summits are conferences organized specifically for educators, researchers, and administrators. iED Summits consist of presentations, panel discussions, break-out sessions and workshops that provide attendees with an in-depth overview of immersive learning platforms, technologies and cutting-edge research from around the world. iED Summits feature new and emerging virtual worlds, learning games, educational simulations, mixed/augmented reality, and related teaching tools, techniques, technologies, standards and best practices.&lt;ref&gt;Immersive Education Inititiative (iED): http://mediagrid.org/summit/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Virtual World Conference is an annual conference exploring the uses of virtual worlds for learning, collaborative work and business. The first event was held on 15 September 2010 and hosted entirely in Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;Virtual World Conference: http://www.thevirtualworldconference.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond virtual worlds==
Virtual World Language Learning is a rapidly expanding field and it converges with other closely related areas, such as the use of MMOGs, SIEs and Augmented Reality Language Learning (ARLL).

===Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs)===
MMOGs (massively multiplayer online games) are also used to support language learning, for example the World of Warcraft in School project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wowinschool.pbworks.com/w/page/5268731/FrontPage|title=World of Warcraft in School / FrontPage|publisher=WoWinSchool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic immersive environments (SIEs)===
SIEs are engineered 3D virtual spaces that integrate online gaming aspects.  They are specifically designed for educational purposes and offer learners a collaborative and constructionist environment. They also allow the creators/designers to focus on specific skills and pedagogical objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Sykes J., Oskoz A. &amp; Thorne S. (2008) "Web 2.0, Synthetic Immersive Environments, and Mobile Resources for Language Education", ''CALICO Journal'' 25, 3: pp. 528-546: https://calico.org/html/article_715.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augmented reality language learning (ARLL)===
[[Augmented reality]] (AR) is the combination of real-world and computer-generated data so that computer generated objects are blended into real time projection of real life activities. Mobile AR applications, such as Blippar, [[Layar]] and [[Wikitude]] enable immersive and information-rich experiences in the real world and are therefore blurring the differences between real life and virtual worlds. This has important implications for m-Learning ([[Mobile Assisted Language Learning]]), but hard evidence on how AR is used in language learning and teaching is difficult to come by.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers H. (2009) "Augmented Reality Language Learning – virtual worlds meet m-learning", Avatar Languages Blog: http://www.avatarlanguages.com/blog/arll/&lt;/ref&gt;

The main aim is to promote social integration among users located in the same physical space, so that multiple users may access to a shared space which is populated by virtual objects while remaining grounded in the real world. In other words, it means:
*Communication
*Locked view
*Keep control
*Security

'''''Ways of Hearing'''''({{ISBN|0 575 06809 4}}) is a 2001 book about [[pop music]] by [[Ben Thompson (author)|Ben Thompson]]. The book, which is subtitled "A user's guide to the pop psyche, from [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] to [[Eminem]]", describes how Western pop music intersects with films, videos, television shows, and fiction. The book includes short essays on a number of performers, including alternative rocker [[Blixa Bargeld]], contemporary composer [[John Cale]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], hip-hop artists [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Eminem]], Montreal avant-garde band [[Godspeed You Black Emperor!]], heavy metal singer-bassist [[Lemmy]], [[Meatloaf (singer)]], Rolling Stones guitarist [[Cliff Richard]], [[Pet Shop Boys]] and country rockers [[Wilco]]. The last section in the book describes different subgenres of pop, including metal, psychedelic, and political rock.

A review of the book calls it "a collection of rock writing" based around the author's goal of examining "the different ways of listening which form subcultural territories around various forms of popular music".&lt;ref name="review"&gt;Book review available online at: http://www.illiterarty.com/reviews/book-review-ways-hearing-ben-thompson  Accessed on July 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer states that as "...a collection of rock journalism, this holds up quite well", and states that it contains "...competent, occasionally inspired rock writing". The reviewer states that Thompson has "...an intriguing way to introduce and link an apparently disparate bunch of information, and makes the reader contextualise seemingly off-hand utterings of musicians in within a new frame."&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; The reviewer states that some of the interviews with performers that Thompson included seem like "padding". Moreover, the reviewer states that the "segments of academic-ese" that Thompson puts around the interview sections "tend to obfuscate the topic at hand, or, when they’re successful, set up an intriguingly open-ended argument which, ten pages later, is revealed to be literally open-ended...[without providing]... many of his own answers".&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

The '''World Ocean Conference 2009''' ('''WOC''') is an international conference to develop a common understanding and firm commitment to address the adverse impact of [[climate change]] on the state of the world’s [[ocean]]s, and increase understanding on the role of the oceans as ‘climate moderator’. This conference includes diplomats and heads of state from a number of countries.  It took place in May 2009 in [[Manado]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Ocean Conference 2009 Digelar di Manado |url=http://edukasi.kompas.com/read/2008/11/27/17355392/world.ocean.conference.2009.digelar.di.manado |publisher=[[Kompas]]|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its topic is the threat to various nations from rising oceans due to [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Ocean Conference Bulletin|url=http://enb.iisd.org/oceans/woc2009/html/ymbvol162num5e.html |publisher=[[International Institute for Sustainable Development]]|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference was scheduled to be held from 11 - 14 May, included hundreds of officials and experts from over 74 countries.&lt;ref name="development_bank_1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asian Development Bank|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as a prelude to talks in December 2009 regarding a successor agreement to the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="nations_23"&gt;{{Harvnb|United Nations|2009|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The 1982 [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS), as the instrument that sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol, the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), and the [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]], 1972, and its 1996 Protocol.&lt;ref name="nations_23"&gt;{{Harvnb|United Nations|2009|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982|url=http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm |publisher=[[United Nations]]|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognises that oceans and coasts provide valuable resources and services to support human populations, particularly coastal communities that heavily depend on them. Sustainable use of marine living resources will enhance global [[food security]] and reduce poverty for present and future generations. The declaration will be put forward to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN FCCC]] and hopefully adopted at the [[Copenhagen Accord|COP 15]] in [[Copenhagen]] at the end of the year.&lt;ref name="mangroves"&gt;{{cite news|title=World Ocean Conference|url=https://www.mangrovesforthefuture.org/news-and-media/events/indonesia/2009/world-ocean-conference/ |publisher=Mangroves for the Future|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;{{cite news|title=Manado Ocean Declaration Adopted at World Ocean Conference - Ocean States Eye Copenhagen|url=http://www.cep.unep.org/news-and-events/manado-ocean-declaration-adopted-at-world-ocean-conference-ocean-states-eye-copenhagen|publisher=Caribbean Environment Programme|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change issues that could potentially result on [[inter alia]].&lt;ref name="world bank"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Ocean Conference 2009 &amp; Coral Triangle Initative &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; Summit|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTINDONESIA/Resources/226271-1170911056314/PaparanWOC-CTI_WORLDBANK.pdf |publisher=[[World Bank]]|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degradation of marine environment, in particular the [[biodiversity loss|loss of marine diversity]], threatened [[marine ecosystem]]s by land-based and sea-based pollution, alien [[invasive species]], unsustainable use of marine and coastal resources, physical alteration, poor [[land-use planning]], and socio-economic pressures, equally concerned over marine ecosystems and living resources being affected by sea level rise, increased water temperature, ocean acidification, changing weather patterns, and other variations that may result from climate change, and how these alterations may aggravate the existing pressures of marine [[environmental degradation]] and increase risks to global food security, economic prosperity, and the well-being of human populations.&lt;ref name="mangroves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="world bank"/&gt;

Realizing the detrimental effects and importance of climate change, The WOC  agreed to discuss the commitments on how to increase the role ocean in reducing the impact of climate change. The WOC have three main interests of states:&lt;ref name="world bank"/&gt;
* SIDS - very concern on [[sea-level rise]] (Indonesia is the largest archipelagical country in the world). Climate change is particularly threatening to Indonesia as sea level rise would adversely affect many Indonesia's low lying coastal areas.&lt;ref name="vaughn_19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughn|2010|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tropical developing states - on adaptation measures, food security, and livelihood
* Developed states - observing the possibility that the ocean could function as "Carbon Sink"

==Objectives==
The main purpose of the WOC 2009 is to adoption of [[Manado Ocean Declaration]] (MOD).&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt; The declaration consists of 14 core opening paragraphs and 21 points of operative agreement. The contents of the declaration include the commitment to long-term conservation, management, and sustainable use of marine living resources, establish national strategies to sustainably manage marine and coastal ecosystems and enhance their resilience, reduce land- and sea-based pollution, and also to increase understanding and information exchange on coasts, oceans and climate change, particularly in developing countries.&lt;ref name="world bank"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deklarasi Kelautan Manado Disepakati 75 Negara|url=http://sains.kompas.com/read/2009/05/14/18203851/Deklarasai.Kelautan.Manado.Disepakati.75.Negara|publisher=[[Kompas]]|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticism the MOD was not strong enough to push the international community to help developing nations deal with the impacts of climate change, Indonesian Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Minister [[Freddy Numberi]], chairman of the conference, said the WOC had put oceans center stage in world attention and raised awareness of the importance of oceans in climate change. But representatives from both developed and developing countries expressed satisfaction with the results.&lt;ref name="mod"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FINAL Press Release: Laporan Capaian Panitia Penyelenggara WOC 2009 dan CTI Summit serta Langkah Menuju ke COP-15 UNFCCC Kopenhagen|url=http://beritamanado.com/final-press-release-laporan-capaian-panitia-penyelenggara-woc-2009-dan-cti-summit-serta-langkah-menuju-ke-cop-15-unfccc-kopenhagen/|publisher=PT BMCOM|accessdate=6 July 2017|language=Indonesian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
