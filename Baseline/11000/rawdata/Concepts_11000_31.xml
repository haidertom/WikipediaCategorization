In philosophy, '''animalism''' is a theory according to which humans are animals.&lt;ref&gt;Eric T. Olson (2007) ''What are we?: a study in personal ontology'', Oxford University Press, section 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of animalism is advocated by philosophers [[Eric T. Olson (philosopher)|Eric T. Olson]], Paul Snowdon, Stephan Blatti, and [[David Wiggins]].&lt;ref name=garrett&gt; Brian Garrett, ''Personal Identity and Self-Consciousness''.

'''Archetypal pedagogy''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|d|ə|ɡ|ɒ|dʒ|i}} is a theory of education developed by [[Clifford Mayes]] that aims at enhancing psycho-spiritual growth in both the teacher and student.  The idea of archetypal pedagogy stems from the [[Jungian psychology|Jungian tradition]] and is directly related to [[analytical psychology]].

==  History ==

[[Clifford Mayes]], professor in the [[Brigham Young University]] [[McKay School of Education]], has developed what he has termed archetypal pedagogy. Mayes' work aims at promoting what he calls archetypal reflectivity in teachers; this is a means of encouraging teachers to examine and work with psychodynamic issues, images, and assumptions as those factors affect their pedagogical practices. Archetypal reflectivity, which draws not only upon Jungian psychology but [[transpersonal]] psychology generally, offers an avenue for teachers to probe the spiritual dimensions of teaching and learning in non-dogmatic terms.

Mayes' most recent work, ''Teaching and Learning for Wholeness: The Role of Archetypes in Educational  Processes'' (2017), develops his ongoing project of incorporating into Jungian pedagogy the [[psychoanalytic]] theories of [[Heinz Kohut]] (particularly Kohut's notion of the [[selfobject]]) and the [[object relations theory]] of [[Ronald Fairbairn]] and [[D.W. Winnicott]]. Some of Mayes' work in [[curriculum theory]], especially ''Seven Curricular Landscapes: An Approach to the Holistic Curriculum'' (2003) and ''Understanding the Whole Student: Holistic Multicultural Education'' (2007), is concerned with [[holistic education]].

== Archetypes and pedagogy  ==
{{See also|Archetype}}
[[Archetype]]s are, according to [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]] [[psychologist]] [[Carl Jung]], innate universal psychic dispositions that form the substrate from which the basic themes of human life emerge. Being universal and innate, their influence can be detected in the form of myths, symbols, rituals and instincts of human beings. Archetypes are components of the [[collective unconscious]] and serve to organize, direct and inform human thought and behaviour.

According to Jung, archetypes heavily influence the human life cycle, propelling a neurologically hard-wired sequence which he called the stages of life. Each stage is mediated through a new set of archetypal imperatives which seek fulfillment in action. These may include being parented, initiation, courtship, marriage and preparation for death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stevens, Anthony|chapter='The archetypes' (Chapter 3.)|editor=Papadopoulos, Renos|year=2006|title=The Handbook of Jungian Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pedagogy]], or paedagogy, is the [[art]] or [[science]] of being a [[teacher]]. The term generally refers to strategies of instruction, or a style of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;[from NSF]&lt;/ref&gt; Pedagogy is also sometimes referred to as the correct use of teaching strategies (see [[instructional theory]]). ''Pedagogy'' comes from the [[ancient greek|ancient Greek]] ''παιδαγωγία'', of ''παιδός'' ({{IPA-el|paiˈdos|}}) "child" and ''ἄγω'' ({{IPA|[ˈaɡɔː}}) "to drive, to raise, to take the way".

Archetypal pedagogy is the discovery of self and knowledge by means of the archetypes.

The archetypes are innate, universal prototypes for ideas and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and interpretations associated with an archetype is a [[Complex (psychology)|complex]], e.g. a mother complex associated with the mother archetype. Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological constructs that arose through [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/jung.html| title = Carl Jung| first = C. George| last = Boeree| accessdate = 2006-03-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060206030011/http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/jung.html| archivedate= 6 February 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an archetype "is as much an organ to the psyche as the liver is to metabolism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Laughlin, C.D.|author2=Tiberia, V.A.|year=2012|title=Archetypes: Toward a Jungian anthropology of consciousness |journal=Anthropology of Consciousness|volume=23|issue=2|p=137|last-author-amp=y|doi=10.1111/j.1556-3537.2012.01063.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archetypes can help educators become more deeply self-aware and recognize themselves in the collective unconscious or "soul of the world" through images of not only 'the teacher' but also "healers, great mothers, warriors, visionaries, tricksters, and so on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bean, J.P.|year=1998|title=Alternative models of professorial roles: New languages to reimagine faculty work|journal=The Journal of Higher Education|volume=69|issue=5|p=505|doi=10.2307/2649107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers can engage in a process of ''archetypal reflectivity'' through such practices as journal work, interpersonal writing exercises, meditation, or even psychotherapy in order to make unconscious factors of their teaching practice conscious and "to 'surface' the deeper images and assumptions that inform their sense of calling and classroom practice".&lt;ref name="Mayes 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mayes, C.|year=2003|title=Foundations of an archetypal pedagogy|journal=Psychological Perspectives|volume=46|issue=1|pp=104–115|doi=10.1080/00332920308405775}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|104}}

==Archetypal dimensions for teacher reflection==

'''Teacher as the Icarus Archetype:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Like [[Icarus]], a teacher's "wax wings will melt in the unforgiving daily sun of classroom reality" if they lack the humility to recognize themselves as "co-learners" involved in the process of learning with their students.

Teachers who function as "co-learners" and authoritative facilitators create the best classroom environments&lt;ref name="Mayes 2003"/&gt;{{rp|113}}

'''Teacher as "co-learner" is balanced by two Archetypes:''' &lt;br /&gt;
'''The Sage''' –  has already conquered many challenges and developed a deeper understanding of life's lessons.&lt;br /&gt;
'''The Novitiate'''  –  the novice, beginner who is about to embark on his/her life journey, but has yet to conquer the challenges.
This archetypal orientation (Sage/Novitiate) frees the teacher "from the impossible burden of feeling that [they] must have all the answers" that is characteristic of the omniscient all-knowing authority figure archetypes: the Wise One, the Great Mother and the Great Father.&lt;ref name="Mayes 2003"/&gt;{{rp|113}}

'''Student as Hero Archetype:'''&lt;br /&gt;
The student is understood as the [[Novitiate]]-hero (the novice) who is beginning the [[individuation]] quest.&lt;ref name="Mayes 2003"/&gt;{{rp|106}}

'''Teacher as Sage Archetype:'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Novitiate-hero meets the wise old man or woman who has already completed his or her archetypal quest.  As this [[Wise old man|Sage]] encourages the Novitiate through the guidance of riddles and conundrums, the Novitiate's world is deconstructed, thus forcing the Novitiate to seek "a higher wisdom".&lt;&lt;ref name="Mayes 2003"/&gt;{{rp|106}}

'''Teacher as an Archetype of Spirit:''' &lt;br /&gt;
Mayes explores four variations of Jung's idea of teacher as archetype of spirit.

&lt;br /&gt;
'''1.  Discursive Spirituality''' – Teacher as philosopher&lt;ref name="Mayes 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mayes, C.|year=2002|title=The teacher as an archetype of spirit|journal=Curriculum Studies|volume=34|issue=6|pages=699–718|doi=10.1080/00220270110118816}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|704}}&lt;br /&gt;
:''Potential:'' when archetype is balanced it can foster 'cognitive intelligence' and 'higher order thinking'
:''Problem:'' over emphasis on this archetype constricts other domains i.e. poetics and spiritual insights

'''2. Civic Spirituality''' – Teacher as national prophet&lt;ref name="Mayes 2002"/&gt;{{rp|706}}
:''Potential:'' calls students to their "noblest traditions and aspirations" in terms of social justice and communal equity.
:''Problem:'' the teacher as a shadow prophet can call students toward a "bias against merit, wealth, individual achievement" – understanding these to be racist vices.

'''3. Ontological Spirituality''' – Teacher as Zen master, counsellor, mother&lt;ref name="Mayes 2002"/&gt;{{rp|709}}
:''Potential:''  Zen teaching becomes a mysterious and paradoxical form of "non-teaching" and counsellor/mother teaching is grounded in receptiveness, relatedness and responsiveness (focused on the needs of the Other).
:''Problem:''  The ontological exemplar can deteriorate into elitism, anti-intellectualism and self-absorption for both teacher and student.

'''4. Incarnational Spirituality''' – Teacher as priest&lt;ref name="Mayes 2002"/&gt;{{rp|712}}
:''Potential:''  Teacher becomes "minister of light and love", and teaching is seen as a sacred act that incarnates religious doctrine into a teaching practice in order to create a positive learning environment for all students (regardless of faith commitment).
:''Problem:''  Teachers may consciously or unconsciously project their faith commitments onto their students in the context of increasingly multicultural classrooms.

===Individuation and self-realization===

Individuation is a process of psychological differentiation, having for its goal the development of the individual personality. "In general, it is the process by which individual beings are formed and differentiated; in particular, it is the development of the psychological individual as a being distinct from the general, collective psychology" (C.G. Jung. Psychological Types. Collected Works Vol. 6., par. 757).

An innate need for [[self-realization]] leads people to explore and integrate these rejected materials. This natural process is called [[individuation]], or the process of becoming an individual.

According to Jung, self-realization can be divided into two distinct tiers. In the first half of their lives, humans separate from humanity. They attempt to create their own identities (I, myself). This is why there is such a need for young men to be destructive, and can be expressed as animosity from teens directed at their parents. Jung also said they have a sort of "second puberty" that occurs between 35–40 – outlook shifts from emphasis on materialism, sexuality, and having children to concerns about community and spirituality.

In the second half of their lives, humans reunite with the human race. They become part of the collective once again. This is when adults start to contribute to humanity (volunteer time, build, garden, create art, etc.) rather than destroy. They are also more likely to pay attention to their unconscious and conscious feelings. Young men rarely say "I feel angry." or "I feel sad." This is because they have not yet rejoined the human collective experience, commonly reestablished in their older, wiser years, according to Jung. A common theme is for young rebels to "search" for their true selves and realize that a contribution to humanity is essentially a necessity for a whole [[self (Jung)|self]].

Jung proposes that the ultimate goal of the collective unconscious and self-realization is to pull humans to the highest experience. This, of course, is spiritual.

==Nayikas ==
As per Ashta Nayika, there are eight nayikas.

==History and cultural depictions==
[[File:Deceived Heroine (Vipralabdha), Nayika Painting Appended to a Ragamala (Garland of Melodies) LACMA M.73.2.5.jpg|thumb|Vipralabdha throwing away her jewellery.]]
The Ashta-Nayika classification (''nayika-bheda'') first appears in ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' (24.210-11), a key [[Sanskrit]] treatise on Indian [[performing arts]], authored by [[Bharata Muni|Bharata]] (dated between 2nd century BC and 2nd century AD).&lt;ref name="sahitya"/&gt;&lt;ref name="music"&gt;{{cite book|last=Luiz Martinez|first= José |title=Semiosis in Hindustani music|year=2001|publisher=Motilal Banarsidas Publishers|isbn=81-208-1801-6|pages=288–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is detailed in later works like the ''Dasarupaka'' (10th century), ''[[Sahityadarpana]]'' (14th century) and various other treatises on poetics as well as erotic ''[[Kamashastra]]'' texts like Kuttanimata (8th-9th century) based on courtesans, ''Panchasayaka'', ''Anangaranga'' and ''Smaradipika''. [[Keshavdas|Keshavadasa]]'s ''Rasikapriya'' (16th century) in [[Hindi]], also elaborates on the Ashta-nayika.&lt;ref name="sodhi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sodhi|first=Jiwan|title=A study of Bundi school of painting|year=1999|publisher=Abinav Publishers|isbn=81-7017-347-7|pages=52–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashta-Nayika have been illustrated in [[Indian painting]], literature, sculpture as well as [[Indian classical dance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Banerji|first=Projesh |title=Dance in thumri|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lsuhSiITjU8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA13&amp;dq=Ashta+Nayika|year=1986|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=81-7017-212-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman |title=Woman in Indian sculpture|year=2006|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=81-7017-474-0|pages=93–106|chapter=Shringara nayika}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable medieval paintings that depict the Ashta nayika are the [[Ragamala paintings]], as those from the [[Bundi]] school of painting.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

A famous example in Indian literature is [[Jayadeva]]'s ''[[Gita Govinda]]'' (12th century) as well as in the [[Vaishnava]] poet Banamali's compositions, [[Radha]] dons the roles of the various nayikas while with her nayaka is the god [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2007/09/14/stories/2007091450100200.htm|title=Learn the lingo|date=Sep 14, 2007|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashta-Nayika is a central theme in ''Pahari embroidery'' used to decorate the ''Chamba [[Rumal]]'', especially produced in [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]], [[Himachal Pradesh]]. The Ashta Nayika are usually portrayed in eight panels on the Rumal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naik|first=Shailaja D. |title=Traditional embroideries of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNAwl-jS3gwC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=%22Ashta+Nayika%22|year=1996|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=81-7024-731-4|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indian (Hindustani) classical music, the eternal love between [[Radha]] and [[Krishna]] is represented through the consciousness of [[Radha]] as the leitmotif that dominates the lyrics. Especially the semi-classical genre of [[Thumri]] imbibes the myriad moods of [[Radha]] as Ashta Nayika consumed by passionate love for [[Krishna]].

==The classification==
The ''Natya Shastra'' describes the nayikas in the following order: Vasakasajja, Virahotkanthita, Svadhinabhartruka, Kalahantarita, Khandita, Vipralabdha, Proshitabhartruka and Abhisarika. The nayikas are further classified in two varieties of the ''[[shringara]] rasa'', the ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' related to love: Sambhoga (love in meeting) and Vipralambha (love in separation). Vasakasajja, Svadhinabhartruka and Abhisarika are associated with  Sambhoga; the others with Vipralambha.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

In the ''Shringara Prakasha'', Bhoja relates the various nayakas and nayikas with musical ''[[raga]]''s and ''ragini''s (a female raga). Somanatha's ''Ragavibodha'' (1609) and Damodara's ''Sangitadarpana'' (c. 1625) continue this trend.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Vasakasajja===

Vasakasajja ("one dressed up for union")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Vasakasajjika is waiting for her lover returning from a long journey. She is depicted in her bed-chamber filled with lotus leaves and garlands.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; She is dressing herself for the union with her lover and "eager with expectation of love's pleasure".&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; Her beauty is compared by Kesavadasa to [[Rati]] - the Hindu love goddess, waiting for her husband, the love god [[Kamadeva]].&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; A Vasakasajja sculpture is found in the Lakshmana Temple in [[Khajuraho]] and the National Museum, Delhi.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' associates the raginis [[Bhupali]] and [[Todi]] with Vasakasajja.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Virahotkanthita===

Virahotkanthita ("One distressed by separation")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Utka (as described by Keshavadasa) is the distressed heroine pining for her lover, who, due to his preoccupation, fails to return home. She is depicted waiting for him, sitting or standing on a bed or out in the pavilion.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;

The ''Ragavibodha'' identifies the raginis Mukhari, Pauravi and Turushkatodi with the Virahotkanthita, while the ''Sangitadarpana'' names Patamanjari in this category.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

Svadhinabhartruka ("one having her husband in subjection")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Svadhinapatika(as named by Keshavadasa) is the woman who is loved by her husband and controls him. He is subjugated by her intense love and pleasing qualities.He is devoted and faithful to her
&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In paintings, this nayika is depicted with a nayaka, who applies ''[[Alta (dye)|mahawar]]'' on her feet or a vermilion [[tilak]] (mark) on her forehead.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; In [[Jayadeva]]'s [[Gita Govinda]] as well as in the poem ''Kuru Yadunandana'', [[Radha]] is portrayed as a Svadhinabhartruka. In the latter, Radha commands her lover, the god [[Krishna]], to rearrange her makeup which is in disarray due to their fierce [[coitus]].&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

Many raginis like Malashri, Travanika, Ramakriti, Jaitashri and Purvi  are associated with Svadhinabhartruka.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Kalahantarita===

Kalahantarita ("one separated by quarrel")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; or Abhisandhita (as named by Keshavadasa)&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; is a heroine separated from her lover due to a quarrel or jealousy&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; or her own arrogance.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; Her lover is usually depicted leaving her apartment disheartened, while she too becomes heartsick and repentant without him.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; In other portrayals, she is depicted refusing the advances of her lover or refusing a wine cup from him. In Gita Govinda, Radha is also portrayed as Kalahantarita in an instance.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

===Khandita===
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Khandita Nayika.jpg|thumb|upright|Khandita rebuking her lover.]]

Khandita ("one enraged with her lover")&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; is an enraged heroine, whose lover had promised her to spend the night with her, but instead comes to her house the next morning after spending the night with another woman. She is depicted offended, rebuking her lover for his infidelity.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

In the ''Sangitadarpana'', the ragini Varati represents the Khandita Nayika.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Vipralabdha===

Vipralabdha ("one deceived by her lover"),&lt;ref name="music"/&gt; , is a deceived heroine,&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt; who waited for her lover the whole night.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; She is depicted throwing away her jewellery as her lover did not keep his promise.&lt;ref name="sodhi"/&gt; This happens when a lover meets a Khandita and promises a tryst and breaks his promise.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The ''Sangitadarpana'' associates Vipralabdha with the ragini Bhupali. However, the ''Ragavibodha'' presents the raginis Varati and Velavati as Vipralabdhas.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

===Proshitabhartruka===
[[File:Proshita-patika Nayika.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Proshita-patika mourning.]]

In [[Developmental psychology|development]] or [[morality|moral]], [[political]], and [[bioethics|bioethical]] [[philosophy]], '''autonomy'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ancient Greek]]: αὐτονομία ''autonomia'' from αὐτόνομος ''autonomos'' from αὐτο- ''auto-'' "self" and νόμος ''nomos'', "law", hence when combined understood to mean "one who gives oneself one's own [[law]]"&lt;/ref&gt; is the capacity to make an informed, un-coerced decision. '''Autonomous''' [[organization]]s or [[institution]]s are independent or self-governing. Autonomy can also be defined from human resource perspective and it means a level of discretion granted to an employee in his or her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=C.R.|title=Autonomy without a self}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, autonomy is known to bring some sense of job satisfaction among the employees. Autonomy is a term that is also widely used and in the field of medicine. As a matter of fact, personal autonomy is greatly recognized and valued in health care.

==Sociology==
In the [[sociology of knowledge]], a branch of [[sociology]], a controversy over the boundaries of autonomy stopped at the concept of relative autonomy,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Pierre Bourdieu|BOURDIEU, 2001]] (MARANHÃO, 2005; [http://www.encontroanpocs.org.br/2006/lista_gt.asp?atvid=26&amp;entid=66 2006]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008165230/http://www.encontroanpocs.org.br/2006/lista_gt.asp?atvid=26&amp;entid=66 |date=October 8, 2010 }}; [https://web.archive.org/web/20070610214637/http://www.sbsociologia.com.br/congresso_v02/papers/GT3%20Ci%C3%AAncia%2C%20Tecnologia%20e%20Inova%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Social/A%20Autonomia%20Reflexiva%20e%20o%20Fomento%20do%20CNPq%20%C3%A0%20Pesquisa%20no%20Campo%20da%20Sociologia%20%282000-2006%29.pdf 2007]; [http://www.flacsoandes.org/dspace/bitstream/10469/382/1/Íconos%20no.31%20-%20mayo%202008.pdf SOBRAL &amp; MARANHÃO, 2008]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; until a typology of autonomy was created and developed within [[science and technology studies]]. According to it, the contemporary form of science's existing autonomy is the [[reflexive autonomy]]: actors and structures within the [[scientific]] field are able to translate or to reflect diverse themes presented by social and political fields, as well as influence them regarding the thematic choices on research projects.

===Institutional autonomy===
[[Institutional]] autonomy is having the capacities as a legislator to be able to implant and pursue official goals. The institutions are responsible for finding the right amount of resources or modify their current plans, programs, courses, responsibilities, and services to be able to have the means fit the end.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, P. B., Rueschemeyer, D., &amp; Skocpol, T. (1985). Bringing the state back in.&lt;/ref&gt; But in order to do so, they must counter the obstacles that can occur, such as social pressure and socioeconomic difficulties. From a legislator's point of view, to increase institutional autonomy, conditions of [[self-managed economy|self-management]] and institutional self-governance must be put in place. An increase in leadership and a redistribution of the responsibilities of decision-making would be beneficial to the research of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Neave, G. (2012). The evaluative state, institutional autonomy and re-engineering higher education in Western Europe: The prince and his pleasure.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Institutional autonomy was often seen as a synonym for [[self-determination]], and the government feared that it would lead institutions to an [[irredentist]] or [[secessionist]] state.  But autonomy should be seen as the solution to the struggles of self-determination.  Self-determination is a movement toward independence, whereas autonomy is a way to accommodate the separatist in a country.  Institutional autonomy has been the answer to conflicts regarding minorities and ethnic groups in a society. Allowing more autonomy to groups and institutions helps create diplomatic relationships with them and the government.&lt;ref&gt;Weller, M., &amp; Wolff, S. (2014). Autonomy, self-governance, and conflict resolution: Innovative approaches to institutional design in divided societies.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{main|Political freedom}}
In governmental parlence, autonomy refers to self-governance. An example of an autonomous jurisdiction was the former United States governance of the [[Philippine Islands]]. The ''Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916'' provided the framework for the creation of an autonomous government under which the [[Filipino people]] had broader domestic autonomy than previously, although it reserved certain privileges to the United States to protect its [[sovereignty|sovereign]] rights and interests.&lt;ref name=CorpusJuris&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Philippine Bill of 1902 (note: Philippine Autonomy Act) |encyclopedia=Corpus Juris |url=http://thecorpusjuris.com/constitutions/philippine-autonomy-act.php |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525075502/http://www.thecorpusjuris.com/constitutions/philippine-autonomy-act.php |archivedate=2016-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example was the status of [[Kosovo]] as the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]] under the former Yugoslav government of [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Melissa Katherine |last1=Bokovoy |first2=Jill A. |last2=Irvine |first3=Carol S. |last3=Lilly |year=1997 |title=State-society relations in Yugoslavia, 1945–1992 |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |pages=295–301 |isbn=978-0-312-12690-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Autonomy is a key concept that has a broad impact on different fields of [[philosophy]]. In [[metaphysical philosophy]], the concept of autonomy is referenced in discussions about [[free will]], [[fatalism]], [[determinism]], and [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]. In ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', philosopher [[Iain King]] developed an 'Autonomy Principle', which he defines as "Let people choose for themselves, unless we know their interests better than they can."&lt;ref&gt;''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1847-063-472}}. p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;  King argues it is not enough to know someone else's interests better than the person; autonomy should only be infringed if a person is ''unable'' to know their own interests on a particular matter.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 17, 'Letting People Choose for Themselves', of ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', Iain King, Continuum, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1847-063-472}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[moral philosophy]], autonomy refers to subjecting oneself to objective moral law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/autonomy-moral/#BasDis Autonomy in Moral and Political Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]. Plato.stanford.edu. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== According to Kant ===
[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) defined autonomy by three themes regarding [[contemporary ethics]]. Firstly, autonomy as the right for one to make their own decisions excluding any interference from others. Secondly, autonomy as the capacity to make such decisions through one's own independence of mind and after personal reflection. Thirdly, as an ideal way of living life autonomously. In summary, autonomy is the [[Moral rights|moral right]] one possesses, or the capacity we have in order to think and make decisions for oneself providing some degree of control or power over the events that unfold within one's everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=HlJ8BbjLXSAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=philosophy+and+autonomy+and+kant&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjC1u7Oz6DZAhUD7oMKHZfaDG4Q6AEILjAB#v=snippet&amp;q=autonomy&amp;f=false|title=Kant on Moral Autonomy|last=Sensen|first=Oliver|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107004863|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The context in which Kant addresses autonomy is in regards to [[moral theory]], asking both foundational and abstract questions. He believed that in order for there to be [[morality]], there must be autonomy. He breaks down autonomy into two distinct components. '''“Auto”''' can be defined as the negative form of [[independence]], or to be free in a negative sense. This is the aspect where decisions are made on your own. Whereas, '''“nomos”''' is the positive sense, a [[freedom]] or lawfulness, where you are choosing a law to follow. Kantian autonomy also provides a sense of [[Rationality|rational]] autonomy, simply meaning one rationally possesses the [[motivation]] to govern their own life. Rational autonomy entails making your own decisions but it cannot be done solely in [[Social isolation|isolation]]. Cooperative rational interactions are required to both develop and exercise our ability to live in a world with others.

Kant argued that morality presupposes this autonomy ({{lang-de|Autonomie}}) in moral agents, since moral requirements are expressed in [[categorical imperative]]s. An imperative is categorical if it issues a valid command independent of personal desires or interests that would provide a reason for obeying the command. It is hypothetical if the validity of its command, if the reason why one can be expected to obey it, is the fact that one desires or is interested in something further that obedience to the command would entail. "Don't speed on the freeway if you don't want to be stopped by the police" is a hypothetical imperative. "It is wrong to break the law, so don't speed on the freeway" is a categorical imperative. The hypothetical command not to speed on the freeway is not valid for you if you do not care whether you are stopped by the police. The categorical command is valid for you either way. Autonomous moral agents can be expected to obey the command of a categorical imperative even if they lack a personal desire or interest in doing so. It remains an open question whether they will, however.

The Kantian concept of autonomy is often misconstrued, leaving out the important point about the autonomous agent's self-subjection to the moral law. It is thought that autonomy is fully explained as the ability to obey a categorical command independently of a personal desire or interest in doing so—or worse, that autonomy is "obeying" a categorical command independently of a natural desire or interest; and that heteronomy, its opposite, is acting instead on personal motives of the kind referenced in hypothetical imperatives.

In his ''[[Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals]]'', Kant applied the concept of autonomy also to define the concept of personhood and human [[dignity]]. Autonomy, along with [[rationality]], are seen by Kant as the two criteria for a meaningful life. Kant would consider a life lived without these not worth living; it would be a life of value equal to that of a plant or insect.&lt;ref name="Shafer-Landau, Russ 2010 Pp161"&gt;Shafer-Landau, Russ. "The fundamentals of ethics." (2010). p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kant autonomy is part of the reason that we hold others morally accountable for their actions. Human actions are morally praise- or blame-worthy in virtue of our autonomy. Non- autonomous beings such as plants or animals are not blameworthy due to their actions being non-autonomous.&lt;ref name="Shafer-Landau, Russ 2010 Pp161"/&gt; Kant's position on crime and punishment is influenced by his views on autonomy. Brainwashing or drugging criminals into being law-abiding citizens would be immoral as it would not be respecting their autonomy. Rehabilitation must be sought in a way that respects their autonomy and dignity as human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Shafer-Landau, Russ. "The fundamentals of ethics." (2010). p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

=== According to Nietzsche ===
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote about autonomy and the moral fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24779-nietzsche-on-freedom-and-autonomy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407061713/https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24779-nietzsche-on-freedom-and-autonomy/ |archivedate=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autonomy in this sense is referred to as the free self and entails several aspects of the self, including self-respect and even self-love. This can be interpreted as influenced by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] ([[Self respect|self-respect]]) and [[Aristotle]] ([[self-love]]). For Nietzsche, valuing [[Ethics|ethical]] autonomy can dissolve the conflict between love (self-love) and law (self-respect) which can then translate into reality through experiences of being self-responsible. Because Nietzsche defines having a sense of freedom with being [[Personal responsibility|responsible]] for one's own life, freedom and self-responsibility can be very much linked to autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=D2a9e-FarAYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=philosophy+and+autonomy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi51c_XzqDZAhUD_4MKHZEXCpU4ChDoAQhPMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=autonomy&amp;f=false|title=Nietzsche on Freedom and Autonomy|last=Gemes|first=Ken|last2=May|first2=Simon|date=2009-05-07|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191607882|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== According to Piaget ===

The [[Switzerland|Swiss]] philosopher [[Jean Piaget]] (1896-1980) believed that autonomy comes from within and results from a “free decision”. It is of [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] and the morality of autonomy is not only accepted but obligatory. When an attempt at social interchange occurs, it is reciprocal, ideal and natural for there to be autonomy regardless of why the collaboration with others has taken place. For Piaget, the term autonomous can be used to explain the idea that rules are self-chosen. By choosing which rules to follow or not, we are in turn determining our own [[Behavior|behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=3zEfxTytFnIC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=autonomy+and+piaget&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5sLHkz6DZAhVFyYMKHYZ5BZcQ6AEIPTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=autonomy&amp;f=false|title=Piaget's Construction of the Child's Reality|last=Sugarman|first=Susan|date=1990-01-26|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521379670|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piaget studied the cognitive development of children by analyzing them during their games and through interviews, establishing (among other principles) that the children moral maturation process occurs in two phases, the first of heteronomy and the second of autonomy:
* Heteronomous reasoning: 
Rules are objective and unchanging. They must be literal because the authority are ordering it and do not fit exceptions or discussions. The base of the rule is the superior authority (parents, adults, the State), that it should not give reason for the rules imposed or fulfilled them in any case. Duties provided are conceived as given from oneself. Any moral motivation and sentiments are possible through what one believes to be right. 
* Autonomous reasoning:
Rules are the product of an agreement and, therefore, are modifiable. They can be subject to interpretation and fit exceptions and objections. The base of the rule is its own acceptance, and its meaning has to be explained. Sanctions must be proportionate to the absence, assuming that sometimes offenses can go unpunished, so that collective punishment is unacceptable if it is not the guilty. The circumstances may not punish a guilty. Duties provided are conceived as given from the outside. One follows rules mechanically as it is simply a rule, or as a way to avoid a form of punishment.

=== According to Kohlberg ===

The American psychologist [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] (1927-1987) continues the studies of Piaget. His studies collected information from different latitudes to eliminate the cultural variability, and focused on the moral reasoning, and not so much in the behavior or its consequences. Through interviews with adolescent and teenage boys, who were to try and solve “moral dilemmas,” Kohlberg went on to further develop the [[Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]]. The answers they provided could be one of two things. Either they choose to obey a given law, authority figure or rule of some sort or they chose to take actions that would serve a human need but in turn break this given rule or command.

The most popular moral dilemma asked involved the wife of a man approaching death due to a special type of cancer. Because the drug was too expensive to obtain on his own, and because the pharmacist who discovered and sold the drug had no compassion for him and only wanted profits, he stole it. Kohlberg asks these adolescent and teenage boys (10-, 13- and 16-year-olds) if they think that is what the husband should have done or not. Therefore, depending on their decisions, they provided answers to Kohlberg about deeper rationales and thoughts and determined what they value as important. This value then determined the “structure” of their moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=cShtCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA491&amp;dq=social+and+personality+development&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjuy5L_6NzZAhUizIMKHamHBr4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20and%20personality%20development&amp;f=false|title=Social and Personality Development|last=Shaffer|first=David|date=2008-09-19|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781111807269|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg established three stages of morality, each of which is subdivided into two levels. They are read in progressive sense, that is, higher levels indicate greater autonomy.
* '''Level 1:''' Premoral/Preconventional Morality: Standards are met (or not met) depending on the hedonistic or physical consequences.
** [Stage 0: Egocentric Judgment: There is no moral concept independent of individual wishes, including a lack of concept of rules or obligations.]
** Stage 1:  Punishment-Obedience Orientation: The rule is obeyed only to avoid punishment. Physical consequences determine goodness or badness and power is deferred to unquestioningly with no respect for the human or moral value, or the meaning of these consequences. Concern is for the self.
** Stage 2: Instrumental-Relativist Orientation: Morals are individualistic and egocentric. There is an exchange of interests but always under the point of view of satisfying personal needs. Elements of fairness and reciprocity are present but these are interpreted in a pragmatic way, instead of an experience of gratitude or justice. Egocentric in nature but beginning to incorporate the ability to see things from the perspective of others.
* '''Level 2:''' Conventional Morality/Role Conformity: Rules are obeyed according to the established conventions of a society.
** Stage 3: Good Boy-Nice Girl Orientation: Morals are conceived in accordance with the stereotypical social role. Rules are obeyed to obtain the approval of the immediate group and the right actions are judged based on what would please others or give the impression that one is a good person. Actions are evaluated according to intentions.
** Stage 4: Law and Order Orientation: Morals are judged in accordance with the authority of the system, or the needs of the social order. Laws and order are prioritized.
* '''Level 3:''' Postconventional Morality/Self-Accepted Moral Principles: Standards of moral behavior are internalized. Morals are governed by rational judgment, derived from a conscious reflection on the recognition of the value of the individual inside a conventionally established society. 
** Stage 5:  Social Contract Orientation: There are individual rights and standards that have been lawfully established as basic universal values. Rules are agreed upon by through procedure and society comes to consensus through critical examination in order to benefit the greater good.
** Stage 6: Universal Principle Orientation: Abstract ethical principles are obeyed on a personal level in addition to societal rules and conventions. Universal principles of justice, reciprocity, equality and human dignity are internalized and if one fails to live up to these ideals, guilt or self-condemnation results.

Autonomy in childhood and adolescence is when one strives to gain a sense of oneself as a separate, self-governing individual.&lt;ref name="Berk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berk|first1=Laura|title=Child Development|date=2013|publisher=Pearson|edition=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between ages 1–3, during the second stage of Erikson's and Freud's stages of development, the psychosocial crisis that occurs is autonomy versus shame and doubt.&lt;ref name="Shaffer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaffer|first1=David|title=Social and Personality Development|edition=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significant event that occurs during this stage is that children must learn to be autonomous, and failure to do so may lead to the child doubting their own abilities and feel ashamed.&lt;ref name="Shaffer" /&gt; When a child becomes autonomous it allows them to explore and acquire new skills. Autonomy has two vital aspects wherein there is an emotional component where one relies more on themselves rather than their parents and a behavioural component where one makes decisions independently by using their judgement.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt; The styles of child rearing affect the development of a child's autonomy. Authoritative child rearing is the most successful approach, where the parents engage in autonomy granting appropriate to their age and abilities.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt; Autonomy in adolescence is closely related to their quest for identity.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt; In adolescence parents and peers act as agents of influence. Peer influence in early adolescence may help the process of an adolescent to gradually become more autonomous by being less susceptible to parental or peer influence as they get older.&lt;ref name="Shaffer" /&gt; In adolescence the most important developmental task is to develop a healthy sense of autonomy.&lt;ref name="Shaffer" /&gt;

==Religion==
In [[Christianity]], autonomy is manifested as a partial self-governance on various levels of church administration. During the history of Christianity, there were two basic types of autonomy. Some important parishes and monasteries have been given special autonomous rights and privileges, and the best known example of monastic autonomy is the famous [[Eastern Orthodox]] monastic community on [[Mount Athos]] in [[Greece]]. On the other hand, administrative autonomy of entire ecclesiastical provinces has throughout history included various degrees of internal self-governance.

In [[ecclesiology]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es, there is a clear distinction between autonomy and [[autocephaly]], since autocephalous churches have full self-governance and independence, while every autonomous church is subjected to some autocephalous church, having a certain degree of internal self-governance. Since every autonomous church had its own historical path to ecclesiastical autonomy, there are significant differences between various autonomous churches in respect of their particular degrees of self-governance. For example, churches that are autonomous can have their highest-ranking bishops, such as an [[archbishop]] or [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]], appointed or confirmed by the [[patriarch]] of the [[mother church]] from which it was granted its autonomy, but generally they remain self-governing in many other respects.

In the history of [[Western Christianity]] the question of ecclesiastical autonomy was also one of the most important questions, especially during the first centuries of Christianity, since various archbishops and metropolitans in [[Western Europe]] have often opposed centralizing tendencies of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]].{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=59-66, 130-139}} For example, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is governed by its [[canon law]] which applies to all Roman Catholic churches which are thus not considered autonomous. Various denominations of [[Protestant church]]es usually have more decentralized power, and churches may be autonomous, thus having their own rules or laws of government, at the national, local, or even individual level.

[[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] brings the notion of the Cartesian god being totally free and autonomous. He states that existence precedes essence with god being the creator of the essences, eternal truths and divine will. This pure freedom of god relates to human freedom and autonomy; where a human is not subjected to pre-existing ideas and values.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=The Autonomy Theme in the Church Dogmatics: Karl Barth and his Critics|last=Macken|first=John|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment]], In the [[United States|United States of America]], the federal government is restricted in building a national church. This is due to the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|first amendment's]] recognizing people's freedom's to worship their faith according to their own belief's. For example, [[Federal government of the United States|the American government]] has removed the church from their "sphere of authority"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/nkenlr35&amp;div=11&amp;id=&amp;page=&amp;collection=journals|title=Spheres of Sovereignty: Church Autonomy Doctrine and the Theological Heritage of the Separation of Church and State|last=Renaud|first=Robert Joseph|last2=Weinberger|first2=Laed Daniel|date=2008|website=heinonline.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the churches historical impact on politics and their authority on the public. This was the beginning of the disestablishment process. The Protestant churches in the United States had a large impact on American culture, in the nineteenth century, where they organized the establishment of schools, hospitals, orphanages, colleges, magazines etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion and personal autonomy: the third disestablishment in America.|last=Hammond|first=Phillip|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has brought up the famous, however, misinterpreted term of the separation of church and state. These churches lost the legislative and financial support from the state.

=== The disestablishment process ===

The first disestablishment began with the introduction of the [[bill of rights]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Religion and personal autonomy: the third disestablishment in America|last=Hammond|first=Phillip|date=1992|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, due to the [[Great Depression|great depression]] of the 1930s and the completion of the second world war, the American churches were revived. Specifically the Protestant churches. This was the beginning of the second disestablishment&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; were churches had become popular again but held no legislative power. One of the main reasons why the churches gained attendance and popularity was due to the [[baby boom]]. Where soldiers came back from the [[World War II|second world war]] and started their families. The large influx of newborns gave the churches a new wave of followers. However, these followers did not hold the same beliefs as their parents and brought upon the political, and religious revolutions of the 1960s.

During the 1960s, the collapse of religious and cultural middle brought upon the third disestablishment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Religion became important to the individual and less likely the community. The changes brought from these revolutions significantly increased the personal autonomy of individuals due to the lack of structural restraints giving their added freedom of choice. This concept is known as "new voluntarism"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; where individuals have free choice on how to be religious and the free choice whether to be religious or not.

==Medicine==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}
In a [[medicine|medical]] context, respect for a patient's personal autonomy is [[medical ethics|considered]] one of many fundamental ethical principles in medicine. Autonomy can be defined as the ability of the person to make his or her own decisions. This faith in autonomy is the central premise of the concept of [[informed consent]] and [[shared decision making]]. This idea, while considered essential to today's practice of medicine, was developed in the last 50 years. According to [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James Childress]] (in ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics''), the [[Doctors' Trial|Nuremberg trials]] detailed accounts of horrifyingly exploitative medical "experiments" which violated the subjects' physical integrity and personal autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/808107441|title=Principles of biomedical ethics|last=L.|first=Beauchamp, Tom|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Childress, James F.|isbn=9780199924585|edition=7th |location=New York|oclc=808107441}}&lt;/ref&gt; These incidences prompted calls for safeguards in [[medical research]], such as the [[Nuremberg Code]] which stressed the importance of voluntary participation in medical research. It is believed that the Nuremberg Code served as the premise for many current documents regarding research ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Bernard A|date=January 2006|title=A Summary of Important Documents in the Field of Research Ethics|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|volume=32|issue=1|pages=69–80|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbj005|issn=0586-7614|pmc=2632196|pmid=16192409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect for autonomy became incorporated in health care and patients could be allowed to make personal decisions about the health care services that they receive. Notably, autonomy has several aspects as well as challenges that affect health care operations. The manner in which a patient is handled may undermine or support autonomy of a patient and for this reason, the way a patient is communicated to becomes very crucial. A good relationship between a patient and a health care practitioner needs to be well defined to ensure that autonomy of a patient is respected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=A.H|title=Autonomy, culture and healthcare}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just like in any other life situation, a patient would not like to be under the control of another person. The move to emphasize respect for patient's autonomy rose from the vulnerabilities that were pointed out in regards to autonomy.

However, autonomy does not only apply in a research context. Users of the health care system have the right to be treated with respect for their autonomy, instead of being dominated by the [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1DNCNNX8AIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=silent+world+of+doctor+and+patient&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ubamT9WcAoaH6QG-tZWvBA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=silent%20world%20of%20doctor%20and%20patient&amp;f=the physician]. This is referred to as paternalism. While paternalism is meant to be overall good for the patient, this can very easily interfere with autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandman|first1=Lars|title=Adherence, Shared Decision-Making and Patient Autonomy|journal=Medicine, Health Care, and Philosophy|date=2012|pages=115–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the [[therapeutic relationship]], a thoughtful dialogue between the client and the physician may lead to better outcomes for the client, as he or she is more of a participant in [[decision-making]].

Autonomy varies and some patients find it overwhelming especially the minors when faced with emergency situations. It is important to note that not every patient is capable of making an autonomous decision. those who are unable to make the decisions prompt a challenge to medical practitioners since it becomes difficult to determine the ability of a patient to make a decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole, Willard, Mummery|title=Problematising autonomy and advocacy in nursing|journal=Nursing ethics|volume=21|issue=5|pages=576–582}}&lt;/ref&gt; to some extent, it has been said that emphasis of autonomy in health care has undermined the practice of health care practitioners to improve the health of their patient as necessary. The scenario has led to tension in the relationship between a patient and a health care practitioner. This is because as much as a physician want to prevent a patient from suffering, he or she still has to respect autonomy. Beneficence allows physicians to act responsibly in their practice, which may involve overlooking autonomy. The gap between a patient and a physician has led to problems because in other cases, the patients have complained of not being adequately informed.

The seven elements of informed consent (as defined by Beauchamp and Childress) include threshold elements (competence and voluntariness), information elements (disclosure, recommendation, and understanding) and consent elements (decision and authorization).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b6w7V7gCkSIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=informed+consent&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K7imT8eODciv6AG2mIm6BA&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=informed%20consent&amp;f=false Informed Consent : Legal Theory and Clinical Practice: Legal Theory and ...] - Schools of Law and Medicine Jessica W.

Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers such as Harry Frankfurt consider Beauchamp and Childress criteria insufficient. They claim that an action can only be considered autonomous if it involves the exercise of the capacity to form higher-order values about desires when acting intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;Mappes Thomas, A., and David DeGrazia. "Biomedical Ethics." (2006). Pp54-55&lt;/ref&gt; What this means is that patients may understand their situation and choices but would not be autonomous unless the patient is able to form value judgements about their reasons for choosing treatment options they would not be acting autonomously.

There are many different definitions of autonomy, many of which place the individual in a social context. See also: relational autonomy, which suggests that a person is defined through their relationships with others, and "supported autonomy"&lt;ref name="library.yorku.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.library.yorku.ca/find/Record/2376624 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524174134/https://www.library.yorku.ca/find/Record/2376624 |archivedate=2015-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that in specific circumstances it may be necessary to temporarily compromise the autonomy of the person in the short term in order to preserve their autonomy in the long-term. Other definitions of the autonomy imagine the person as a contained and self-sufficient being whose rights should not be compromised under any circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/634749.The_Inner_Citadel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924145857/http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/634749.The_Inner_Citadel |archivedate=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain unique circumstances, government may have the right to temporarily override the right to [[bodily integrity]] in order to preserve the life and well-being of the person. Such action can be described using the principle of "supported autonomy",&lt;ref name="library.yorku.ca"/&gt; a concept that was developed to describe unique situations in mental health (examples include the [[forced feeding]] of a person dying from the [[eating disorder]] [[anorexia nervosa]], or the temporary treatment of a person living with a [[psychotic disorder]] with [[antipsychotic medication]]). While controversial, the principle of supported autonomy aligns with the role of government to protect the life and liberty of its citizens. Terrence F. Ackerman has highlighted problems with these situations, he claims that by undertaking this course of action physician or governments run the risk of misinterpreting a conflict of values as a constraining effect of illness on a patient's autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Mappes Thomas, A., and David DeGrazia. "Biomedical Ethics." (2006). pp62&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, there have been attempts to increase patient autonomy including the requirement that physician's take bioethics courses during their time in medical school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pilnick|first1=Alison|last2=Dingwall|first2=Robert|title=On the Remarkable Persistence of Asymmetry in Doctor/Patient Interaction: A Critical Review|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=April 2011|volume=72|pages=1374–82|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.02.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite large-scale commitment to promoting patient autonomy, public mistrust of medicine in developed countries has remained.&lt;ref&gt;O'neill, Onora. Autonomy and Trust in bioethics. Cambridge University Press, 2002. Pp3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Onora O'Neill]] has ascribed this lack of trust to medical institutions and professionals introducing measures that benefit themselves, not the patient. O’Neill claims that this focus on autonomy promotion has been at the expense of issues like distribution of healthcare resources and public health.

One proposal to increase patient autonomy is through the use of support staff. The use of support staff including medical assistants, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, and other staff that can promote patient interests and better patient care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sheather|first1=Julian|title=Patient Autonomy|journal=Student BMJ; London|date=2011|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurses especially can learn about patient beliefs and values in order to increase informed consent and possibly persuade the patient through logic and reason to entertain a certain treatment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charles|first1=Sonya|title=The Moral Agency of Institutions: Effectively Using Expert Nurses to Support Patient Autonomy|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|date=2017|volume=43.8|pages=506–509|doi=10.1136/medethics-2016-103448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Humphreys|first1=Sally|title=Patient Autonomy|journal=British Journal of Perioperative Nursing|date=January 2005|volume=15|issue=1|pages=35–38, 40–41, 43|doi=10.1177/175045890501500103}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would promote both autonomy and beneficence, while keeping the physician's integrity intact. Furthermore, Humphreys asserts that nurses should have professional autonomy within their scope of practice (35-37). Humphreys argues that if nurses exercise their professional autonomy more, then there will be an increase patient autonomy (35-37).

==International human rights law==
After the Second World War there was a push for international human rights that came in many waves. Autonomy as a basic human right started the building block in the beginning of these layers alongside with liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/567444414|title=Personal freedom through human rights law? : autonomy, identity and integrity under the European Convention on Human Rights|last=1966-|first=Marshall, Jill,|date=2009|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=9004170596|location=Leiden|oclc=567444414}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Universal declarations of Human rights of 1948 has made mention of autonomy or the legal protected right to individual self-determination in article 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.un.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples reconfirm international law in the aspect of human rights because those laws were already there, but it is also responsible for making sure that the laws highlighted when it comes to autonomy, cultural and integrity and land rights are made within an indigenous context by taking special attention to their historical and contemporary events&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geoff|first=G.|date=1997-02-01|title=Religious Minorities and Their Rights: A Problem of Approach |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/15718119720907435 |journal=International Journal on Minority and Group Rights |language=en |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=97–134 |doi=10.1163/15718119720907435 |issn=1571-8115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples|United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] article 3 also through international law provides Human rights for Indigenous individuals through its third article by giving them a right to self-determination meaning they have all the liberties to chose their political status, and are capable to go and improve their economics social, and cultural statuses in society by developing it. Another example of this is article 4 of the same document which gives them autonomous rights when it comes to their internal or local affairs and how they can fund themselves in order to be able to self govern themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://undocs.org/A/RES/61/295|title=A/RES/61/295 - E|last=|first=|date=|website=undocs.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minorities in countries are also protected as well by international law; the 27th article of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|United Nations International covenant on Civil and Political rights]] or the ICCPR does so by allowing these individuals to be able to enjoy their own culture or use their language. Minorities in that manner are people from ethnic religious or linguistic groups according to the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}} International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court of Human rights]], is an international court that has been created on behalf of the European Conventions of Human rights. However, when it comes to autonomy they did not explicitly state it when it comes to the rights that individuals have. The current article 8 has remedied to that when the case of ''[[Pretty v United Kingdom|Pretty v the United Nations]] which was a case in 2002 involving assisted suicide'' where autonomy was used as a legal right in law. It was where Autonomy was distinguished and its reach into law was marked as well making it the foundations for legal precedent in making case law originating from the European Court of Human rights&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/898273667 |title=Caring autonomy : European human rights law and the challenge of individualism|last=Lõhmus |first=Katri |isbn=1107081777 |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|oclc=898273667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document with no binding effect in [[international human rights law]], contend that "self-determination" used as meaning of autonomy on one's own matters including informed consent or sexual and [[reproductive rights]], is integral for one's self-defined or [[gender identity]] and refused any medical procedures as a requirement for legal recognition of the gender identity of transgender.&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, Principle 3, The Right to Recognition before the Law&lt;/ref&gt; If eventually accepted by the international community in a [[treaty]], this would make these ideas human rights in the law. The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] also defines autonomy as principles of rights of a person with disability including "the freedom to make one's own choices, and independence of persons".&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] Article 3, (a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celebrity culture on teenage autonomy==
A study conducted by David C. Giles and John Maltby conveyed that after age effecting factors were removed a high emotional autonomy was a significant predictor of celebrity interest, as well as high attachment to peers with a low attachment to parents. Patterns of intense personal interest in celebrities was found to be conjunction with low levels of closeness and security. Furthermore, the results suggested that adults with a secondary group of pseudo-friends during development from parental attachment, usually focus solely on one particular celebrity, which could be due to difficulties in making this transition.&lt;ref&gt;Giles, David &amp; Maltby, John. (2004). The Role of Media Figures in Adolescent Development: Relations Between Autonomy, Attachment, and Interest in Celebrities. Personality and Individual Differences. 36. 813-822. 10.1016/S0191-8869(03)00154-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Betty Gram participated in landmark events of the women's rights movement in the early to mid-twentieth century. She joined the women’s rights movement in 1917 and was subsequently jailed five times and went on two hunger strikes. When she was sent to [[Tennessee]] to push for the last vote needed to ratify the [[19th Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment]], a local newspaper announced, “110 Pounds of Femininity Hit Memphis”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brandeis University: Women's Studies Research Center|title=My Militant Suffragette Grandmother, Betty Gram|url=http://calendar.boston.com/waltham_ma/events/show/351880303-my-militant-suffragette-grandmother-betty-gram|publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary newspaper accounts often noted her attractiveness.

==Suffrage Activity, 1917-1919==

After graduating from the University of Oregon, Betty Gram embarked on a stage career, which she left when she came east to join the [[National Woman's Party]] (NWP), led by [[Alice Paul]]. The NWP had split with other women's suffrage groups over its focus on a constitutional amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote, as well as on its aggressive tactics. Other groups, namely the [[National American Woman's Suffrage Association]], had built a state by state suffrage strategy and opposed the NWP's targeting of President Wilson and Democrats as well as its picketing effort.&lt;ref&gt;Jailed for Freedom, Doris Stevens&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Woman's Party began its picketing of the White House in January 1917.  In March of that year, over one thousand women took part. By June, the White House decided to arrest the picketers.  Since holding signs is not illegal, the women demanded to know the reason for their arrest. The eventual charge was obstructing traffic. Those charges were dismissed and no trial was held. But a new pattern had begun - the women picketers were not deterred. Upon their release, they went straight back to picketing the White House and were arrested again. A front page photo in the Evening Tribune of San Diego bore the caption, "Washington has found that the only way to keep a picket away from the White House is to put her in jail."&lt;ref&gt;Evening Tribune, San Diego, November 24, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;  This time the picketers were found guilty of obstructing traffic and fined $25 or 3 days in jail. The women refused to pay the fine. A rapid escalation followed until the leader of the NWP, [[Alice Paul]] was sentenced to 7 months in jail. Betty and her sister, Alice Gram, and 39 others were jailed for obstructing traffic on November 10, 1917; that picket was part of a protest of Alice Paul's sentence. The charge of obstructing traffic was widely understood as a sham - the Oregonian newspaper clearly stated as much in an article covering the Gram sisters' arrest.&lt;ref name="The Oregonian, November 15, 1917"&gt;The Oregonian, November 15, 1917&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, Betty was quoted as saying, "I am going to prison for the suffrage case, with the full knowledge that I have committed no offense."&lt;ref name="The Oregonian, November 15, 1917"/&gt;  

Instead of being sent to the local jail, the November 10th picketers were sent to the [[Lorton Reformatory|Occoquan Workhouse]] in Virginia, where the inmates were forced to do prison labor. Horrible conditions faced the women in the workhouse - they were beaten, kept in isolation, and given rancid food. After being refused recognition as political prisoners, the women declared a [[hunger strike]]. The leaders of the NWP, including Alice Paul, were force fed.  The Gram sisters were released after 17 days in jail, along with 22 other hunger strikers, although they had been sentenced to 30 days.&lt;ref name=Kappa_Alpha_Theta_Magazine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Mary Edith Estes|title=Jailed for the Freedom to Vote|journal=The Kappa Alpha Theta Magazine|year=2008|issue=Autumn|page=12|url=http://issuu.com/theta/docs/autumn_2008_magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrests and hunger strike were widely covered in newspapers across the country and Betty was featured prominently.  The Oregonian noted that, by the time they were released, Betty and Alice had lost 12 and 19&amp;nbsp;lbs respectively.&lt;ref&gt;The Oregonian, November 24, 1917&lt;/ref&gt;  But their arrests and ill-treatment did not deter the Grams or the other picketers, who continue pressuring President Wilson and Congress to take up a constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote.  In January 1919, Betty Gram was one of two sentries outside the White House standing guard over a bonfire in which they burned President Wilson's speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Miami District Daily News, January 10, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;  The next month she was arrested in Boston when 21 members of the National Woman's Party gathered in front of the State House with suffrage banners.  They were there to protest President Wilson's arrival in Boston.  The women were arrested when they refused to comply with police orders to move.  In newspaper accounts, Betty was singled out as resisting arrest and had to be "lifted bodily" into the police wagon.&lt;ref&gt;Salt Lake Telegram (AP story), February 24, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratification Efforts==
After multiple attempts through 1918 and the beginning of 1919, on June 4, 1919, Congress finally passed the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] granting women the right to vote, pending ratification by the states. Betty Gram and the National Woman's Party quickly shifted their efforts from the White House to the states.  Betty became a leader in the ratification campaign, working in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Delaware, West Virginia, Tennessee, and other states. In January 1920, suffragists defeated a New Jersey referendum movement that would have put the question of ratification directly to voters.&lt;ref&gt;Trenton Evening Times, January 1, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  Delaware became an important battleground state, with an active anti-suffrage movement.  According to the Boston Herald, the NWP sent its "most experienced ratification campaigners" there, including Betty Gram.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Herald, March 15, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 1920, suffragists picketed the Republican National Convention in Chicago, hoping to pressure the Republican legislature of Delaware and Republican governors of Connecticut and Vermont for their failure to ratify the amendment.  The Cleveland Plain Dealer, covering the convention, described Betty Gram as "young, vivacious, and pretty" and referenced the miniature steel jail door she wore as a breast pin, symbolizing her time in jail for the cause of women's suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland Plain Dealer, June 9, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  The NWP did not picket the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco.

In July 1920, Betty Gram was on her way to Tennessee to capture the 36th, and last, state needed for ratification.  Her hometown paper, the Oregonian, interviewed her on her work to get women the right to vote. Betty said, "I joined the picket group because I realized suffrage was at a standstill and unless something dramatic was done, nothing could be accomplished.".&lt;ref&gt;The Oregonian, July 9, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution. The long battle was won.

==Post-Suffrage==
Having finally succeeded in their years-long effort, the National Woman's Party and other women's groups had to reconsider the makeup and mission of their organizations.   In addition, the NWP lost some members as women focused on their careers or other causes.  Still others "found that marriage and family responsibilities at least temporarily curtailed their NWP activities."&lt;ref&gt;Becker, Susan. The Origins of the Equal Rights Amendment&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after the ratification of the 19th amendment, Betty Gram set off for Europe to resume her music studies. After marrying Raymond Swing in 1921, her husband's career as a radio commentator and foreign correspondent took them to England, where they lived for over a decade. Now Betty Gram Swing, Betty continued her work for women's rights in the UK and in the international arena.

===A Rift===
Even with the right to vote, there were many other barriers to the full participation of women in business and society. The NWP, the [[League of Women Voters]], the Business and Professional Women, the [[Women's Trade Union League]] and other groups all worked to improve women's lives, but they had very different philosophies and approaches. The NWP faction are referred to as "equalitarian feminists", because they adopted a platform of equal rights for women, as opposed to the "social feminists" who supported a broader set of humanitarian social reforms, including child labor laws and protectionist legislation such as limiting a woman's work week, prohibiting night work for women, and a minimum wage for women and children. There were other legal issues facing women as well, such as the right to serve on a jury, equal rights of inheritance and property ownership, and questions of a married woman's citizenship independent of her husband's.  However, like the fight for suffrage, much disagreement remained among the various feminist groups as to the best way to achieve economic opportunity or economic independence for women.  
An essential element of this rift concerned employment rights for married women, specifically labor laws protecting women versus NWP's “equality” argument.  The NWP was against protectionist legislation, arguing it hurt women in the workplace by causing employers not to hire them.  As historian Susan Becker describes the feminist movement in the 1920s and 1930s the NWP "stood alone throughout these two decades in its single-minded dedication to obtaining legal equality between men and women." &lt;ref&gt;Becker, Susan, Origins of the Equal Rights Amendment&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equal Rights==
In 1926, Betty Gram Swing, along with two other American members of the NWP, formed an English outpost of the group in order to aid British feminists in their efforts to repeal the laws limiting women's voting rights to women over the age of 30.&lt;ref&gt;Seattle Daily Times, December 7, 1926&lt;/ref&gt; Having also fought (and picketed) for equal pay for women and married women's employment rights during her years in England, Betty Gram Swing returned to the United States in 1934. In the fall of that year, she gave a speech to the Inter-American Commission of Woman at the Pan-American Union warning that women would lose their hard-earned rights unless they were ready to fight for them.  A Washington Post article covering the speech described Betty as one of "the youngest and most beautiful leaders in international feminism."&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, November 12, 1934&lt;/ref&gt; The article notes that Betty was focused at that time on having the [[Equal Rights Treaty]] "ratified and adhered to by all nations."

===Amendment and Treaty===
In the post-suffrage time period, American women's groups divided their attention between new legislative agendas, the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (either supporting or opposing it) and the growing focus on international women's issues, highlighted by the NWP's efforts to lobby for approval of the Equal Rights Treaty, which was modeled on the Equal Rights Amendment but was intended as an international document to be ratified by nations. In the 1930s both equalitarian and social feminist agendas were hampered by the Great Depression and the rise of fascism.

The NWP drafted the first version of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1921 and it provoked disputes almost immediately, even before it was introduced in Congress in 1923. It was addressed in Congressional subcommittees throughout the 1920s and 1930s but was not reported out until 1936. Hearings and committee reports followed into the 1940s, with the [[League of Women Voters]] and other social feminist groups consistently opposing it.  At the same time, the NWP was working internationally on the Treaty, which was presented to the Sixth Pan American conference in 1928 and, unofficially, at international talks in Paris. (With shades of their picketing days, Betty Gram Swing, NWP veteran Doris Stevens, and a few others attempted to present the Equal Rights Treaty to President [[Gaston Doumergue]] of France, while he was hosting negotiations of the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]].  They were refused entry and when they refused to leave the gates, they were held in custody for a few hours.)

Even though the United States was not a member of the [[League of Nations]], the NWP focused its Treaty efforts there, using its relationships with Latin American women's groups for support.  Again, social feminists opposed the Treaty because of they believed it would undermine international protectionist labor laws benefitting women. Ultimately, the League of Nations reported the Treaty back to national governments, women's groups, and the International Labor Office, which was a social feminist organization. With the NWP excluded from the decision-making, in 1938 Alice Paul formed the World Women's Party with European equalitarian feminists but the organization was unable to make great strides in the near-term because of the outbreak of [[World War II]].

===The Post-War Period and International Women's Rights===
The post-war battles between women’s groups resolved themselves along the same lines as the pre-war battles, with the NWP and equalitarians on one side and social feminists on the other. This time, they would battle over the establishment of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. NWP's position as a strong backer of a UN Commission placed it at odds with other groups, including the League of Women Voters.

In 1946, Betty was in London as a National Woman's Party representative to the World Women’s Party  along with British feminist [[Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence]].  The NWP supported international efforts like creating a UN commission on women partly in the hope that it would secure the ERA at home.  Others opposed those efforts for the same reason.  [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], who was anti-ERA and viewed as an opponent of the NWP, was a representative to the UN Conference. These disputes left American women on the sidelines to some extent and the effort to create a UN commission for women was led by New Zealand. On February 16, 1946 the sub-Commission on the Status of Women was formed as part of the Human Rights Commission, and granted full status after its first meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Women’s History, Winter 2008, Laville, Helen.

'''Bioregionalism''' is a [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], and [[Ecology|ecological]] system or set of views based on naturally defined areas called [[bioregion]]s, similar to [[ecoregion]]s. Bioregions are defined through physical and environmental features, including [[Drainage basin|watershed]] boundaries and [[soil]] and [[terrain]] characteristics. Bioregionalism stresses that the determination of a bioregion is also a [[culture|cultural]] phenomenon, and emphasizes local populations, knowledge, and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/260/385 Bioregionalism: The Need For a Firmer Theoretical Foundation]{{dead link|date=October 2017}}", Don Alexander, Trumpeter v13.3, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioregionalism asserts "that a bioregion’s environmental components (geography, climate, plant life, animal life, etc.) directly influence ways for human communities to act and interact with each other which are, in turn, optimal for those communities to thrive in their environment. As such, those ways to thrive in their totality—be they economic, cultural, spiritual, or political—will be distinctive in some capacity as being a product of their bioregional environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://towardscascadia.com/2015/11/15/bioregionalism-place-shapes-identity/|title=Bioregionalism: Place Shapes Identity|last=M|first=Ryan|date=2015-11-15|website=Towards Cascadia|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioregionalism is a concept that goes beyond [[national boundaries]]—an example is the concept of [[Cascadia (independence movement)|Cascadia]], a region that is sometimes considered to consist of most of [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the [[Alaska Panhandle]], the far north of [[California]] and the [[West Coast of Canada]], sometimes also including some or all of [[Idaho]] and [[western Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cascadiaprospectus.org/2010/02/cascadia_the_new_frontier.php |title=Cascadia: The New Frontier |publisher=Cascadia Prospectus |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312125000/http://www.cascadiaprospectus.org/2010/02/cascadia_the_new_frontier.php |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a bioregion, which does not cross national boundaries, but does overlap state lines, is [[the Ozarks]], a bioregion also referred to as the Ozarks Plateau, which consists of southern [[Missouri]], northwest [[Arkansas]], the northeast corner of [[Oklahoma]], southeast corner of [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|url=http://ozarkareacommunitycongress.org/|work=OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogregions are not synonymous with ecoregions as defined by bodies such as the [[World Wildlife Fund]] or the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]]; the later are scientifically based and focused on wildlife and vegetation. Bioregions, by contrast are human regions, informed by nature but with a social and political element. In this way bioregionalism is simply [[political localism]] with an ecological foundation.

==Overview==
The term was coined by Allen Van Newkirk, founder of the Institute for Bioregional Research, in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Michael Vincent|title=Bioregionalism|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=041515444-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; given currency by [[Peter Berg (bioregionalist)|Peter Berg]] and [[Raymond Dasmann]] in the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Peter and Raymond Dasmann, "Reinhabiting California," ''The Ecologist'' 7, no. 10 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; and has been advocated by writers such as [https://books.google.ca/books?id=n42Rf_ibaMcC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=david+haenke&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1AM-OxjlTj&amp;sig=1LBacDKoY42fT8ZcHu5eDmfQ46A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiox6e2qevKAhVFsoMKHQU6DCIQ6AEIRTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20haenke&amp;f=false David Haenke] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Walter Truett. [https://archive.is/20120529125505/http://motherjones.com/print/16589 There's no going back to nature], ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' (September/October 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bioregionalist perspective opposes a homogeneous economy and consumer culture with its lack of stewardship towards the environment. This perspective seeks to:
*Ensure that political boundaries match ecological boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, S. (2007) "The Troubled Marriage of Deep Ecology and Bioregionalism," ''Environmental Values'', vol. 16(3): 313-332&lt;/ref&gt;
*Highlight the unique [[ecology]] of the bioregion.
*Encourage consumption of [[local food]]s where possible.
*Encourage the use of local [[natural resource|materials]] where possible.
*Encourage the cultivation of [[indigenous (ecology)|native plants]] of the region.
*Encourage [[sustainability]] in harmony with the bioregion.&lt;ref&gt;Bastedo, Jamie. ''Shield Country: The Life and Times of the Oldest Piece of the Planet'', Red Deer Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-88995-191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioregional mapping''' is a powerful tool to increase understanding, change the story and influence policy.  A good bioregional map shows layers of geology, flora, fauna, and inhabitation over time. All the interdisciplinary content that is integrated in this kind of map makes it a great communication tool to illustrate an ecological approach. One of the best examples of a richly communicative bioregional map is David McClosky's [http://cascadia-institute.org/ new map of Cascadia].

==Relationship to environmentalism==

Bioregionalism, while akin to [[environmentalism]] in certain aspects, such as a desire to live in harmony with [[nature]], differs in certain ways from classical, 20th century environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |date=1998-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Peter Berg, bioregionalism is [[proactive]], and is based on forming a harmony between human culture and the natural environment, rather than being [[protest]]-based like the original environmental movement. Also, while classical environmentalists saw human industry as the [[enemy]] of nature and nature as a victim needing to be saved; bioregionalists see humanity and its culture as a part of nature, focusing on building a positive, sustainable relationship with the environment, rather than a focus on preserving and segregating the [[wilderness]] from the world of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |date=1998-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
North American Bioregional Assemblies have been bi-annual gatherings of bioregionalists throughout North America since 1984 and have given rise to national level [[Green Parties]]. In addition, bioregionalism spawned the sustainability movement{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The tenets of bioregionalism are often used by green movements, which oppose political organizations whose boundaries conform to existing electoral districts.  This problem is perceived to result in elected representatives voting in accordance with their constituents, some of whom may live outside a defined bioregion, and may run counter to the well-being of the bioregion.

At the local level, several bioregions have congresses that meet regularly. For instance, the Ozark Plateau bioregion hosts a yearly Ozark Area Community Congress, better known as OACC, which has been meeting every year since 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|url=http://ozarkareacommunitycongress.org/|work=OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; most often on the first weekend in October. The Kansas Area Watershed, "KAW" was founded in 1982 and has been meeting regularly since that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas Area Watershed Council History|url=http://kawcouncil.wordpress.com/about/history/|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; KAW holds a yearly meeting, usually in the spring.

The government of the Canadian province of Alberta has recently made major amendments to its land-use policies including a separate "land-use framework" document for each major [[river basin]] within the province.  This is supported by local initiatives such as the [[Beaver Hills (Alberta)|Beaver Hills]] Initiative, which seeks to create a large [[biosphere reserve]] encompassing [[Elk Island National Park]] and the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beaverhills.ca/|title=Home {{!}} Beaver Hills Initiative|website=www.beaverhills.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9379">{{Immanuel Kant}}

In [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s philosophy, a '''category''' ({{lang-de|Categorie}} in the [[Critique of Pure Reason|original]] or ''Kategorie'' in [[modern German]]) is a pure concept of the [[#The table of judgments|understanding]] (''Verstand''). A Kantian category is a characteristic of the appearance of any object in general, before it has been experienced. Kant wrote that "They are concepts of an object in general…."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', B129, (''Sie sind Begriffe von einem Gegenstande überhaupt'')&lt;/ref&gt; Kant also wrote that, "…pure cоncepts [Categories] of the undеrstanding which apply to objects of [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]] in general…."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 79 (''reine Verstandesbegriffe, welche a priori auf Gegenstände der Anschauung überhaupt gehen'')&lt;/ref&gt; Such a category is not a classificatory division, as the word is commonly used. It is, instead, the condition of the [[Epistemic possibility|possibility]] of objects in general,&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 139&lt;/ref&gt; that is, objects as such, any and all objects, not specific objects in particular.

== Meaning of "category" ==

The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:κατηγορία|κατηγορία]], ''katēgoria'', meaning "that which can be said, predicated, or publicly declared and asserted, about something." A category is an attribute, property, quality, or characteristic that can be predicated of a thing. "…I remark concerning the categories…that their logical employment consists in their use as predicates of objects."&lt;ref&gt;Letter from [[Jakob Sigismund Beck|Beck]] to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], June 20, 1797&lt;/ref&gt; Kant called them "ontological predicates."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Judgement]]'', Introduction, V&lt;/ref&gt;

A category is that which can be said of everything in general, that is, of anything that is an object. [[J.S. Mill|John Stuart Mill]] wrote: "The Categories, or Predicaments &amp;mdash; the former a Greek word, the latter its literal translation in the Latin language &amp;mdash; were believed to be an enumeration  of all things capable of being named, an enumeration by the ''summa genera'' (highest kind), i.e., the most extensive classes into which things could be distributed, which, therefore, were so many highest Predicates, one or other of which was supposed capable of being affirmed with truth of every nameable thing whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, John Stuart, ''[[A System of Logic]]'', I, 3, §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] had claimed that the following ten predicates or categories could be asserted of anything in general: substance, quantity, quality, relation, action, affection (passivity), place, time (date), position, and state. These are supposed to be the qualities or attributes that can be affirmed of each and every thing in experience. Any particular object that exists in thought must have been able to have the Categories attributed to it as possible predicates because the Categories are the properties, qualities, or characteristics of any possible object in general. The Categories of Aristotle and Kant are the general properties that belong to all things without expressing the peculiar nature of any particular thing. Kant appreciated Aristotle's effort, but said that his table was imperfect because " … as he had no guiding principle, he merely picked them up as they occurred to him..."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The Categories do not provide knowledge of individual, particular objects. Any object, however, must have Categories as its characteristics if it is to be an object of experience. It is presupposed or assumed that anything that is a specific object must possess Categories as its properties because Categories are predicates of an object in general. An object in general does not have all of the Categories as predicates at one time.  For example, a general object cannot have the qualitative Categories of reality and negation at the same time. Similarly, an object in general cannot have both unity and plurality as quantitative predicates at once. The Categories of Modality exclude each other. Therefore, a general object cannot simultaneously have the Categories of possibility/impossibility and existence/non&amp;ndash;existence as qualities.

Since the Categories are a list of that which can be said of every object, they are related only to human language. In making a verbal statement about an object, a speaker makes a judgment. A general object, that is, every object, has attributes that are contained in Kant's list of Categories. In a judgment, or verbal statement, the Categories are the predicates that can be asserted of every object and all objects.

==The table of judgments&lt;!--'Understanding (Kant)' redirects here--&gt;==
Kant believed that the ability of the human '''understanding'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (German: ''Verstand'', Greek: ''[[dianoia]]'' "διάνοια", Latin: ''[[ratio]]'') to think about and know an object is the same as the making of a spoken or written judgment about an object. According to him, "Our ability to judge is equivalent to our ability to think."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 80&lt;/ref&gt;
A judgment is the thought that a thing is known to have a certain quality or attribute. For example, the sentence "The rose is red" is a judgment. Kant created a table of the forms of such judgments as they relate to all objects in general.&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 71&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Table of Judgements
|-
! Category !! colspan="3" style="text-align: center;" | Judgements

This table of judgments was used by Kant as a model for the table of categories. Taken together, these twelvefold tables constitute the formal structure for Kant's [[Kantian architectonics|architectonic]] conception of his philosophical system.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmquist, "The Architectonic Form of Kant's Copernican Logic", ''Metaphilosophy'' 17:4 (October 1986), pp.266-288; revised and reprinted as Chapter III of Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp1 ''Kant's System of Perspectives'']: ''An architectonic interpretation of the Critical philosophy'' (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schemata==
Categories are entirely different from the appearances of objects. According to Kant, in order to relate to specific phenomena, categories must be "applied" through [[time]]. The way that this is done is called a [[Schema (Kant)|schema]].

==Criticism==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]], in his [[Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy|criticism of the Kantian philosophy]], found many errors{{Examples|date=September 2018}} in Kant's use of the Categories of Quality, Quantity, Relation, and Modality. Schopenhauer also noted that in accordance with Kant's claim, non-human animals would not be able to know objects. Animals would only know impressions on their [[sense organ]]s, which Kant mistakenly{{Clarify|date=September 2018}} calls [[perception]].

'''Concept testing''' (to be distinguished from '''pre-test markets''' and '''test markets''' which may be used at a later stage of product development research)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the process of using surveys (and sometimes [[qualitative marketing research|qualitative methods]]) to evaluate consumer acceptance of a new product idea prior to the introduction of a product to the [[Market (economics)|market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|title=Concept Testing: How to Test New Product Ideas Before You Go to Market|date=1987|publisher=American Management Association|isbn=978-0814459058|edition=1st|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is '''important not to confuse''' concept testing with advertising testing, brand testing and packaging testing; as is sometimes done. Concept testing focuses on the basic product idea, without the embellishments and puffery inherent in advertising.

It is important that the instruments (questionnaires) to test the product have a high quality themselves. Otherwise, results from data gathered surveys may be biased by measurement error. That makes the design of the testing procedure more complex. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire. This can be done by:
* conducting [[cognitive pretesting|cognitive interviewing]]. By asking a faction of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can verify the viability of the cognitive interviewing.
* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.
* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest,&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F. and Novick, M. R.(1968). Statistical theories of mental test scores. Addison – Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; quasi-simplex,&lt;ref&gt;Heise, D. R.(1969). Separating reliability and stability in test-retest correlation. American Sociological Review, 34, 93-101.&lt;/ref&gt; or mutlitrait-multimethod models.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, F. M. (1984). Construct validity and error components of survey measures: a structural modelling approach. Public Opinion Quarterly, 48, 409-442.&lt;/ref&gt;
* predicting the measurement quality of the question. This can be done using the software Survey Quality Predictor (SQP).&lt;ref&gt;Saris, W. E. and Gallhofer, I. N. (2014). Design, evaluation and analysis of questionnaires for survey research. Second Edition. Hoboken, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept testing in the new product development (NPD) process is the concept generation stage. The concept generation stage of concept testing can take on many forms. Sometimes concepts are generated incidentally, as the result of technological advances. At other times concept generation is deliberate: examples include brain-storming sessions, problem detection surveys and qualitative research. While qualitative research can provide insights into the range of reactions consumers may have, it cannot provide an indication of the likely success of the new concept; this is better left to quantitative concept-test surveys.

In the early stages of concept testing, a large field of alternative concepts might exist, requiring concept-screening surveys. Concept-screening surveys provide a quick means to narrow the field of options; however they provide little depth of insight and cannot be compared to a normative database due to interactions between concepts. For greater insight and to reach decisions on whether or not pursue further product development, monadic concept-testing surveys must be conducted.

Frequently concept testing surveys are described as either monadic, sequential monadic or comparative. The terms mainly refer to how the concepts are displayed:

1.) Monadic. The concept is evaluated in isolation.
2.) Sequential monadic. Multiple concepts are evaluated in sequence (often randomized order).
3.) Comparative. Concepts are shown next to each other. 
4.) Proto-monadic. Concepts are first shown in sequence, and then next to each other.

"Monadic testing is the recommended method for most concept testing. Interaction effects and biases are avoided. Results from one test can be compared to results from previous monadic tests. A normative database can be constructed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, each has its specific uses and it depends on the research objectives. The decision as to which method to use is best left to experience research professionals to decide, as there are numerous implications in terms of how the results are interpreted.

==Evaluating concept-test scores==

Traditionally concept-test survey results are compared to 'norms databases'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Jerry|title=Concept Testing (And The "Uniqueness" Paradox)|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/concepttesting/|website=Decision Analyst|publisher=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=2|date=2016-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are databases of previous new-product concept tests. These must be 'monadic' concept tests, to prevent interaction effects. To be fair, it is important that these databases contain 'new' concept test results, not ratings of old products that consumers are already familiar with; since once consumers become familiar with a product the ratings often drop. Comparing new concept ratings to the ratings for an existing product already on the market would result in an invalid comparison, unless special precautions are taken by researchers to reduce or adjust for this effect quantitatively. Additionally, the concept is usually only compared to norms from the same product category, and the same country.

Companies that specialize in this area, tend to have developed their own unique systems, each with its own standards. Keeping to these standards consistently is important to preventing contamination of the results.

Perhaps one of the famous concept-test systems is the Nielsen Bases system, which comes in different versions. Other well-known products include Decision Analyst's 'Concept Check', Acupoll's 'Concept Optimizer', Ipsos Innoquest and GFK. Examples of smaller players include Skuuber and Acentric Express Test.

==Determining the importance of concept attributes as purchase drivers==

The simplest approach to determining attribute importance is to ask direct open-ended questions. Alternatively checklists or ratings of the importance of each product attribute may be used.

However, various debates have existed over whether or not consumers could be trusted to directly indicate the level of importance of each product attribute. As a result, correlation analysis and various forms of multiple regression have often been used for identifying importance - as an alternative to direct questions.

A complementary technique to concept testing, is conjoint analysis (also referred to as discrete choice modelling). Various forms of conjoint analysis and discrete choice modelling exist. While academics stress the differences between the two, in practice there is often little difference. 
These techniques estimate the importance of product attributes indirectly, by creating alternative products according to an experimental design, and then using consumer responses to these alternatives (usually ratings of purchase likelihood or choices made between alternatives) to estimate importance. The results are often expressed in the form of a 'simulator' tool which allows clients to test alternative product configurations and pricing.

'''Volumetric concept testing'''

Volumetric concept testing falls somewhere between traditional concept testing and pre-test market models (simulated test market models are similar but emphasize greater realism) in terms of the level of complexity. The aim is to provide 'approximate' sales volume forecasts for the new concept prior to launch. They incorporate other variables beyond just input from the concept test survey itself, such as the distribution strategy.

Examples of volumetric forecasting methodologies include 'Acupoll Foresight'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ForeSIGHT™ Going-Year Volume Estimates|url=http://www.acupoll.com/volume-forecasts|website=Acupoll|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Decision Analyst's 'Conceptor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conceptor® Volumetric Forecasting|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/analytics/volumetric/|website=Decision Analyst|accessdate=21 April 2017|ref=3|date=2015-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some models (more properly referred to as 'pre-test market models' or 'simulated test markets')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wind|first1=Yoram|title=NEW-PRODUCT FORECASTING MODELS AND APPLICATIONS|date=1984|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-669-04102-6|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; gather additional data from a follow-up product testing survey (especially in the case of consumer packaged goods as repeat purchase rates need to be estimated). They may also include advertisement testing component that aims to assess advertising quality. Some such as Decision Analyst, include discrete choice models / conjoint analysis.

'''Courage''' (also called '''bravery''' or '''valour''') is the choice and [[willingness]] to confront [[Suffering|agony]], [[pain]], [[Risk|danger]], [[uncertainty]], or [[intimidation]]. '''Physical courage''' is bravery in the face of physical pain, hardship, death or threat of death, while '''moral courage''' is the ability to [[ethics|act rightly]] in the face of popular opposition, [[shame]], [[scandal]], discouragement, or personal loss.

The [[Cardinal virtues|classical virtue]] of '''fortitude''' (''andreia, fortitudo'') is also translated "courage", but includes the aspects of [[perseverance (virtue)|perseverance]] and [[patience]].&lt;ref name=Rickaby&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06147a.htm|last=Rickaby|first=John|section=Fortitude|title=The Catholic Encyclopedia|volume=6|location=New York|publisher=Robert Appleton Company|year=1909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Western tradition, notable thoughts on courage have come from philosophers, [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], and [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]].

Much earlier, in the Hindu tradition, mythology has given many examples of bravery, valour and courage. Ramayana and Mahabharatha have in them many examples of both physical and moral courage.

In the Eastern tradition, some thoughts on courage were offered by the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''. More recently, courage has been explored by the discipline of psychology.

==Characteristics of Courage==
Daniel Putman, a professor at the University of Wisconsin - Fox Valley, wrote an article titled "The Emotions of Courage". Using a text from Aristotle's ''Nicomanachean Ethics'' as the basis for his article, he discusses the relationship between fear and confidence in the emotion of courage. &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1115b17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"First, in feelings of fear and confidence the mean is bravery (andreia).The excessively fearless person is nameless...while the one who is excessively confident is rash; the one who is excessively afraid and deficient in confidence is cowardly."}} -Aristotle &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, 1115b17–19&lt;/ref&gt;

He states that "courage involves deliberate choice in the face of painful or fearful circumstances for the sake of a worthy goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/0047-2786.00107| title=The Emotion of Courage | volume= Volume 32, Issue 4 | publisher=Blackwell Publishers | accessdate= November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this realization, Putman concludes that "there is a close connection between fear and confidence". {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=464}}

===Fear &amp; Confidence in Relation to Courage===
Fear and confidence in relation to courage can determine the success of a courageous act or goal.{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=463}}They can be seen as the independent variables in courage, and their relationship can affect how we respond to fear. {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=466}} In addition, the confidence that is being discussed here is self-confidence; Confidence in knowing one's skills and abilities and being able determine when to fight a fear or when to flight it. {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}} Putman states that:

{{quote|"The ideal in courage is not just a rigid control of fear, nor is it a denial of the emotion. The ideal is to judge a situation, accept the emotion as part of human nature and, we hope, use well-developed habits to confront the fear and allow reason to guide our behavior toward a worthwhile goal."}}{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}}
When trying to understand how fear and confidence play into courage, we need to look back at Aristotle's quote. According to Putman, Aristotle is referring to an appropriate level of fear and confidence in courage.{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}} "Fear, although it might vary from person to person, is not completely relative and is only appropriate if it "matches the danger of the situation"."{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}}The same goes for confidence in that there are two aspects to self-confidence in a dangerous situation.
#{{quote | "a realistic confidence in the worth of a cause that motivates positive action."{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}}
#{{quote | "knowing our own skills and abilities. A second meaning of appropriate confidence then is a form of self-knowledge."{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=465}}}}}}

Without an appropriate balance between fear and confidence when facing a threat, one cannot have the courage to overcome it. Putman states "if the two emotions are distinct, then excesses or deficiencies in either fear or confidence can distort courage."{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}

===Possible Distortions of Courage===
As noted above, an "excess or deficiency of either fear or confidence, can distort courage".{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}} According to Putman, there are four possibilities:
#{{quote | "Higher level of fear than a situation calls for, low level of confidence" {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}
#{{quote | "Excessively low level of fear when real fear is appropriate, excessively high level of confidence." {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}
#{{quote | "Excessively high level of fear, yet the confidence is also excessively high." {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}
#{{quote | "Excessively low level of fear and low level of confidence." {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}}}}}}}}}

Putman explains each of these possibilities accordingly: an individual in the first possibility is perceived as a coward; in the second possibility a rash person. {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}. For the remaining two possibilites, he uses analogies to explain them. The third possibility can occur if someone experienced a traumatic experience that brought about great anxiety for much of their life.{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}Then the fear that they experience would often be inappropriate and excessive. {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}} Yet as a defensive mechanism, the person would show excessive levels of confidence as a way to confront their irrational fear and ""prove" something to oneself or other".{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}} So this distortions could be seen as a coping method for their fear. For the last possibility, it can be seen as hopelessness. Putman says this is similar to "a person on a sinking ship". {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}} "This example is of a person who has low confidence and possibly low self-regard who suddenly loses all fear".{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}} The distortion of low fear and low confidence can occur in a situation where an individual accepts what is going to happen to them. In regards to this example, they lose all fear because they know death is unavoidable and the reason it is unavoidable is because they do not have the ability to handle or overcome the situation.

Thus, Daniel Putman identifies fear and courage as being deeply intertwined and that they rely on distinct perceptions: 
*{{quote | "the danger of the situation{{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}
*{{quote | "the worthiness of the cause {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}
*{{quote | "and the perception of one's ability." {{sfn|Putman|2001|pp=467}}}}}}}}
==Theories==

=== Ancient Greece ===
The early Greek philosopher Plato (c. 428–348 BCE)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/plato-9442588#synopsis |title=Plato Biography Philosopher, Writer (c. 428–348 BCE) |publisher=Biography |accessdate=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; set the groundwork for how courage would be viewed to future philosophers. Plato's early writings found in ''[[Laches (dialogue)|Laches]]'' show a discussion on courage, but they fail to come to a satisfactory conclusion on what courage is.{{sfn|Walton|1986|p=5}}

During the debate between three leaders, including Socrates, many definitions of courage are mentioned.{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=56–58}}
 
{{quote|"…a man willing to remain at his post and to defend himself against the enemy without running away…"{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=56–58}}
"…a sort of endurance of the soul…"{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=56–58}}
"…knowledge of the grounds of fear and hope..." {{sfn|Plato|Cooper|Hutchinson|1997|pp=675–86}} }}

While many definitions are given in Plato's ''Laches'', all are refuted, giving the reader a sense of Plato's argument style. ''Laches'' is an early writing of Plato's, which may be a reason he does not come to a clear conclusion. In this early writing, Plato is still developing his ideas and shows influence from his teachers like Socrates.{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=56–58}}

In one of his later writings, ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato gives more concrete ideas of what he believes courage to be. Civic courage is described as a sort of perseverance – "preservation of the belief that has been inculcated by the law through education about what things and sorts of things are to be feared".{{sfn|Plato|Cooper|Hutchinson|1997|pp=1061–75}} Ideas of courage being perseverance also are seen in ''Laches''. Plato further explains this perseverance as being able to persevere through all emotions, like suffering, pleasure, and fear.{{sfn|Plato|Cooper|Hutchinson|1997|pp=2061–75}}

As a desirable quality, courage is discussed broadly in [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'',{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=59–61}} where its vice of shortage is [[cowardice]] and its vice of excess is [[recklessness (psychology)|recklessness]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Nichomachean Ethics'', 1103b15-20, 1104a15-25, 1104b1-10, 1107a30-1107b5, 1108b15-35, 1109a5-15, 1115a5-1117b25, 1129b20-5, 1137a20-5, 144b5-10, 1167a20, 1177a30-b1, 1178a10-5, 1178a30-5, 1178b10-5,  in ''Aristotle, Translation, Introduction, and Commentary'', Broadie, Sarah, &amp; Rowe, C., [[Oxford University Press]], 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Rome ===

In the [[Roman Empire]], courage formed part of the universal virtue of ''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]''.{{sfn|McDonnell|2006|p=31}} Roman philosopher and statesman [[Cicero]] (106–43 BCE) lists the cardinal virtues does not name them such: {{quote|Virtue may be defined as a habit of mind (''animi'') in harmony with reason and the order of nature.  It has four parts: wisdom (''prudentiam''), justice, courage, temperance.{{sfn|McDonnell|2006|p=129}}&lt;ref&gt;''De Inventione'', II, LIII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Medieval philosophy ===

In medieval [[virtue ethics]], championed by [[Averroes]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and still important to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], courage is referred to as "Fortitude".{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=62–63}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.html|title=Summa Theologica|publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Aquinas]]:&lt;ref name="Summa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3123.htm |title=Summa Theologica: Fortitude (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 123) |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=New Advent |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Among the cardinal virtues, prudence ranks first, justice second, fortitude third, temperance fourth, and after these the other virtues.}}

Part of his justification for this hierarchy is that:
{{quote|Fortitude without justice is an occasion of injustice; since the stronger a man is the more ready is he to oppress the weaker.}}

On fortitude's general and special nature, Aquinas says:&lt;ref name="Summa"/&gt;
{{quote|The term "fortitude" can be taken in two ways. First, as simply denoting a certain firmness of mind, and in this sense it is a general virtue, or rather a condition of every virtue, since as [[Aristotle|the Philosopher]] states,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics|Ethic]]. ii&lt;/ref&gt; it is requisite for every virtue to act firmly and immovably. Secondly, fortitude may be taken to denote firmness only in bearing and withstanding those things wherein it is most difficult to be firm, namely in certain grave dangers. Therefore Tully says,&lt;ref&gt;Rhet. ii&lt;/ref&gt; that "fortitude is deliberate facing of dangers and bearing of toils." On this sense fortitude is reckoned a special virtue, because it has a special matter.}}

Aquinas holds fortitude or courage as being primarily about endurance, not attack:&lt;ref name="Summa"/&gt;
{{quote|As stated above (Article 3), and according to the Philosopher,&lt;ref&gt;Ethic. iii, 9&lt;/ref&gt; "fortitude is more concerned to allay fear, than to moderate daring." For it is more difficult to allay fear than to moderate daring, since the danger which is the object of daring and fear, tends by its very nature to check daring to increase fear. Now to attack belongs to fortitude in so far as the latter moderates daring, whereas to endure follows the repression of fear. Therefore the principal act of fortitude is endurance, that is to stand immovable in the midst of dangers rather than to attack them.}}

=== Western traditions ===

In both Catholicism and [[Anglicanism]], courage is also one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. For [[Thomas Aquinas]], Fortitude is the [[virtue]] to remove any obstacle that keeps the will from following reason.{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=62–63}} Thomas Aquinas argues that Courage is a virtue which, along with the Christian virtues in the [[Summa Theologica]], can only be exemplified with the presence of the Christian virtues: faith, hope, and mercy. In order to understand true courage in Christianity it takes someone who displays the [[virtues]] of faith, hope, and mercy.{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=62–63}} Courage is a natural virtue which Saint Augustine did not consider a virtue for Christians. [[Thomas Aquinas]] considers courage a virtue through the Christian [[virtue]] of mercy.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=204}} Only through mercy and charity can we call the natural virtue of courage a Christian virtue. Unlike [[Aristotle]], Aquinas’ courage is about endurance, not bravery in battle.{{sfn|Miller|2000|pp=21–22}}

===Eastern traditions===
The ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' contends that courage is derived from [[love]] ("[[:wikt:慈|慈]] loving [[:wikt:故|故]] causes [[:wikt:能|能]] ability [[:wikt:勇|勇]] brave"), explaining, ''"One of courage, with audacity, will die.  One of courage, but gentle, spares death.  From these two kinds of courage arise harm and benefit."''&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 67 and 73, [http://www.edepot.com/taoc.html Tao Te Ching] (C. Ganson uses the word "courage", but the Mitchell translation does not.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zhongwen.com/|title=Traditional Chinese Characters|publisher=Zhonwen.com}} Tao Te Ching with [[Hanzi]] translations&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu tradition, Courage (shauriya) / Bravery (dhairya), and Patience (taamasa) appear as the first two of ten characteristics (lakshana) of [[dharma]] in the Hindu [[Manusmṛti]], besides forgiveness (kshama), tolerance (dama), honesty (asthaya), physical restraint ([[indriya]] nigraha), cleanliness (shouchya), perceptiveness (dhi), knowledge (vidhya), truthfulness ([[satya]]), and control of anger (akrodh).

Islamic beliefs also present courage and self-control as a key factor in facing the Devil (both within and external); many believe this because of the courage the Prophets of the past displayed (through peace and patience) against people who despised them for their beliefs.

===Recent past===
====Pre-19th century====
[[Thomas Hobbes]] lists virtues into the categories of moral virtues and virtues of men in his work "Man and Citizen."{{sfn|Hobbes|1972|pp=68–70}} Hobbes outlines moral virtues as virtues in citizens, that is virtues that without exception are beneficial to society as a whole.{{sfn|Hobbes|1972|pp=17–18}} These moral virtues are justice (i.e. not violating the law) and charity. Courage as well as prudence and temperance are listed as the virtues of men.{{sfn|Hobbes|1972|pp=68–70}} By this Hobbes means that these virtues are invested solely in the private good as opposed to the public good of justice and charity. Hobbes describes courage and prudence as a strength of mind as opposed to a goodness of manners. These virtues are always meant to act in the interests of individual while the positive and/or negative effects of society are merely a byproduct. This stems forth from the idea put forth in "Leviathan" that the [[state of nature]] is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short." According to Hobbes courage is a virtue of the individual in order to ensure a better chance of survival while the moral virtues address Hobbes's social contract which civilized men display (in varying degrees) in order to avoid the state of nature.{{sfn|Hobbes|1972|p=290}} Hobbes also uses the idea of fortitude as an idea of virtue. Fortitude is "to dare" according to Hobbes, but also to "resist stoutly in present dangers."{{sfn|Hobbes|1972|pp=150–52}} This a more in depth elaboration of Hobbes's concept of courage that is addressed earlier in "Man and Citizen." This idea relates back to Hobbes's idea that self-preservation is the most fundamental aspect of behavior.

[[David Hume]] listed virtues into two categories in his work ''A Treatise of Human Nature'' as artificial virtues and natural virtues. Hume noted in the Treatise that courage is a natural virtue. In the Treatise's section ''Of Pride and Humility, Their Objects and Causes'', Hume clearly stated courage is a cause of pride: "Every valuable quality of the mind, whether of the imagination, judgment, memory or disposition; wit, good-sense, learning, courage, justice, integrity; all these are the cause of pride; and their opposites of humility".{{sfn|Hume|1751|p=434}}

Hume also related courage and joy to have positive effects on the [[soul]]: "(...) since the soul, when elevated with joy and courage, in a manner seeks opposition, and throws itself with alacrity into any scene of thought or action, where its courage meets with matter to nourish and employ it".{{sfn|Hume|1751|p=666}} Along with courage nourishing and employing, Hume also wrote that courage defends humans in the Treatise: "We easily gain from the liberality of others, but are always in danger of losing by their avarice: Courage defends us, but cowardice lays us open to every attack".{{sfn|Hume|1751|p=459}}

Hume wrote what excessive courage does to a hero's character in the Treatise's section "Of the Other Virtues and Vices": "Accordingly we may observe, that an excessive courage and magnanimity, especially when it displays itself under the frowns of fortune, contributes in a great measure, to the character of a hero, and will render a person the admiration of posterity; at the same time, that it ruins his affairs, and leads him into dangers and difficulties, with which otherwise he would never have been acquainted".{{sfn|Hume|1751|p=900}}

Other understandings of courage that Hume offered can be derived from Hume's views on morals, reason, sentiment, and virtue from his work ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]].''

====19th century onward====

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] opposed courage to [[angst]], while [[Paul Tillich]] opposed an existential ''courage to be'' with [[non-being]],{{sfn|Tillich|1952|p=89}} fundamentally equating it with [[religion]]:
{{quote|Courage is the self-affirmation of being in spite of the fact of non-being. It is the act of the individual self in taking the anxiety of non-being upon itself by affirming itself ... in the anxiety of guilt and condemnation. ... every courage to be has openly or covertly a religious root. For religion is the state of being grasped by the power of being itself.{{sfn|Tillich|1952|pp=152–183}} }}

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] identified in his 1936 lecture "[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]" a "[[Northern Europe|Northern]] 'theory of courage'" – the [[hero]]ic or "[[virtuous pagan]]" insistence to do the right thing even in the face of certain defeat without promise of reward or [[salvation]]:
{{quote|It is the strength of the [[Norse mythology|northern mythological imagination]] that it faced this problem, put the monsters in the centre, gave them victory but no honor, and found a potent and terrible solution in naked will and courage. 'As a working theory absolutely impregnable.' So potent is it, that while the [[Greek mythology|older southern imagination]]  has faded forever into literary ornament, the northern has power, as it were, to revive its spirit even in our own times. It can work, as it did even with the ''[[goðlauss]]'' Viking, without gods: martial heroism as its own end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://completejrrt.tv/tta_open/2$B.+Old+English+Tales+and+Literary+Works%5bSection%5d/8$The+Monsters+And+The+Critics%5bBook%5d/1$Beowulf..+The+Monsters+and+the+Critics%5bChapter%5d/0025.htm|title=Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|last=Tolkien|first=JRR|publisher=The Tolkien Estate|page=25|accessdate=2008-04-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015113632/http://completejrrt.tv/tta_open/2%24B.%2BOld%2BEnglish%2BTales%2Band%2BLiterary%2BWorks%5BSection%5D/8%24The%2BMonsters%2BAnd%2BThe%2BCritics%5BBook%5D/1%24Beowulf..%2BThe%2BMonsters%2Band%2Bthe%2BCritics%5BChapter%5D/0025.htm|archivedate=2007-10-15|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Virtuous pagan heroism or courage in this sense is "trusting in your own strength," as observed by [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''Teutonic Mythology'':

{{quote|Men who, turning away in utter disgust and doubt from the heathen faith, placed their reliance on their own strength and virtue. Thus in the [[Sôlar lioð]] 17 we read of Vêbogi and Râdey ''â sik þau trûðu,'' "in themselves they trusted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grimm|first=Jacob|title=Deutsche Mythologie (Teutonic Mythology)|publisher=Göttingen|location=Dieterich|year=1835|edition=1|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ernest Hemingway]] famously defined courage as "grace under pressure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/1999/julyaugust/feature/celebrating-ernest-hemingway%E2%80%99s-century|year=1999|title=Celebrating Ernest Hemingway's Century|last=Carter|first=Richard|work=neh.gov|publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities|accessdate=2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]] stated, "Courage is rightly esteemed the first of human qualities because it is the quality that guarantees all others."

According to [[Maya Angelou]], "Courage is the most important of the virtues, because without courage you can't practice any other virtue consistently.  You can practice any virtue erratically, but nothing consistently without courage."

In ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] describes [[master–slave morality]], in which a noble man regards himself as a "determiner of values;" one who does not require approval, but passes judgment. Later, in the same text, he lists man's four virtues as "courage, insight, sympathy, and solitude," and goes on to emphasize the importance of courage: "The great epochs of our life are the occasions when we gain the courage to re-baptize our evil qualities as our best qualities."{{sfn|Nietzsche|1989|p=65}}

According to the Swiss psychologist Andreas Dick, courage consists of the following components: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andreas|last=Dick|title=Mut – Über sich hinauswachsen|publisher=Hans Huber Verlag|location=Bern|year=2010|isbn=978-3-456-84835-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. put at risk, risk or repugnance, or sacrifice safety or convenience, which may result in death, bodily harm, social condemnation or emotional deprivation;

2. a knowledge of wisdom and prudence about what is right and wrong in a given moment;

3. Hope and confidence in a happy, meaningful outcome;

4. a free will;

5. a motive based on love.

===Implicit Theories of Courage===
Researchers who want to study the concept and the emotion of courage have continued to come across a certain problem. While there are "numerous definitions of courage"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247520291_Implicit_theories_of_courage | title=Implicit theories of courage | publisher=ResearchGate | volume=2:2 | pp=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;, they are unable to set "an operational definition of courage on which to base sound explicit theories". {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=81}} Rate et al. states that because of a lack of an operational definition, the advancement of research in courage is limited. {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=81}} So they conducted studies to try to find "a common structure of courage". {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=81}} Their goal from their research of implicit theories was to find "people's form and content on the idea of courage".{{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=83}} Many researchers created studies on implicit theories by creating a questionnaire that would ask "What is courage?". {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=83}} In addition, in order to "develop a measurement scale of courage, ten experts in the field of psychology came together to define courage. {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=84}} They defined it as:
{{quote | "the ability to act for a meaningful (noble, good, or practical) cause, despite experiencing the fear associated with perceived threat exceeding the available resources" {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=84}}{{sfn|Woodard|2004|pp=174}}}}

Also, because courage is a "multi-dimensional construct, it can be "better understood as an exceptional response to specific external conditions or circumstances than as an attribute, disposition, or character trait". {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=83}} Meaning that rather than being a show of character or an attribute, courage is a response to fear {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=83}}

From their research, they were able to find the "four necessary components of people's notion of courage".{{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}.They are:
#"intentionality/deliberation"{{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}
#"personal fear"{{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}
#"noble/good act" {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}
#"and personal risk" {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}

With these four components, they were able to define courage as:
{{quote | "a willful, intentional act, executed after mindful deliberation, involving objective substantial risk to the actor, primarily motivated to bring about a noble good or worthy end, despite, perhaps, the presence of the emotion of fear." {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=95}}}}

To further the discussion of the implicit theories of courage, the researchers stated that future research could consider looking into the concept of courage and fear and how individual's might feel fear, overcome it and act, and act despite of it. {{sfn|Rate|Clarke|Sternberg|2007|pp=96}}

== Society and symbolism ==
Its accompanying animal is the [[lion]].{{sfn|Miller|2000|pp=101–102}} Often, fortitude is depicted as having tamed the ferocious lion. Cf. e.g. the [[Tarot]] trump called [[Strength (Tarot card)|Strength]]. It is sometimes seen in the Catholic Church as a depiction of Christ's triumph over sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Revelation|5:5|ESV}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also is a symbol in some cultures as a savior of the people who live in a community with sin and corruption.{{sfn|Walton|1986|pp=199–202}}

==Awards==

{{See also|:Category:Courage awards}}
Several awards claim to recognize courageous actions, including:

* The [[Edelstam Prize]] awarded for outstanding contributions and exceptional courage in standing up for one's beliefs in the defense of Human Rights.
* The [[Victoria Cross]] is the highest military award that may be received by members of the British Armed Forces and the Armed Forces of other [[Commonwealth]] countries for valour "in the face of the enemy", the civilian equivalent being the [[George Cross]]. A total of 1,356 VCs have been awarded to individuals, 13 since [[World War II]]. 
* The [[Medal of Honor]] is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government. It is bestowed on members of the United States armed forces who distinguish themselves "conspicuously by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States".
* [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)]] is the second highest military decoration that can be awarded to a member of the United States Army, awarded for extreme gallantry and risk of life in actual combat with an armed enemy force.
* The [[Carnegie Hero Fund]] – was established to recognize persons who perform extraordinary acts of heroism in civilian life in the United States and Canada, and to provide financial assistance for those disabled and the dependents of those killed saving or attempting to save others.
* The [[Profile in Courage Award]] is a private award given to  displays of courage similar to those John F. Kennedy described in his book Profiles in Courage. It is given to individuals (often elected officials) who, by acting in accord with their conscience, risked their careers or lives by pursuing a larger vision of the national, state or local interest in opposition to popular opinion or pressure from constituents or other local interests.
* The [[Civil Courage Prize]] is a human rights award which is awarded to "steadfast resistance to evil at great personal risk – rather than military valor." It is awarded by the Trustees of The Train Foundation annually and may be awarded posthumously.
* [[Courage to Care Award]] is a plaque with miniature bas-reliefs depicting the backdrop for the rescuers' exceptional deeds during the Nazis' persecution, deportation and murder of millions of Jews.
* The [[Ivan Allen Jr. Prize for Social Courage]] is a prize awarded by [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] to individuals who uphold the legacy of former Atlanta Mayor [[Ivan Allen Jr.]], whose actions in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and testimony before congress in support of the 1963 Civil Rights Bill legislation set a standard for courage during the turbulent [[Civil rights movement|civil rights era]] of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bio &lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt; Ivan Allen Prize |url=http://ivanallenprize.gatech.edu/ivanallenjr_bio |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Param Vir Chakra]] is the highest military award in India given to those who show the highest degree of valour or self-sacrifice in the presence of the enemy. It can be, and often has been, awarded posthumously.
* The [[Military Order of Maria Theresa]], the highest order of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, awarded for "successful military acts of essential impact to a campaign that were undertaken on [an officer's] own initiative, and might have been omitted by an honorable officer without reproach".

'''Cross-boundary subsidies''' are caused by organisms or materials that cross or traverse habitat [[landscape ecology#Patch and mosaic|patch]] boundaries, subsidizing the resident [[populations]]. The transferred organisms and materials may provide additional predators, prey, or nutrients to resident species, which can affect [[community]] and [[food web]] structure. Cross-boundary subsidies of materials and organisms occur in landscapes composed of different habitat patch types, and so depend on characteristics of those patches and on the boundaries in between them. Human alteration of the landscape, primarily through [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]], has the potential to alter important cross-boundary subsidies to increasingly isolated habitat patches. Understanding how processes that occur outside of habitat patches can affect populations within them may be important to habitat management.

==Introduction and development of the concept==
The concept of cross-boundary subsidies developed out of a merging of ideas from the studies of [[landscape ecology]] and [[food web]] ecology. The ideas from landscape ecology allow the study of population, community, and food web dynamics to incorporate spatial relationships between landscape elements into an understanding of such dynamics (Polis et al. 1997).

Janzen (1986) first defined cross-boundary subsidies as a process whereby organisms that disperse from one patch into another impact resident organisms by providing increased food resources or opportunities for reproduction, thus serving as a subsidy to the residents. By this definition, only the cross-boundary movement of organisms is considered, but broader definitions of cross-boundary subsidies can also include materials such as nutrients and [[detritus]] (i.e. Marburg et al. 2006, Facelli and Pickett 1991).

Cross-boundary subsidies are a subset of the more general process of spatial subsidies (see Polis et al. 1997). Cross-boundary subsidies acknowledge the presence and role of the boundary between different habitat patches in mediating flows of organisms and materials. In contrast, spatial subsidies require only that external inputs of materials and organisms originate from outside the patch of interest.

===Conceptual models===
Few attempts have been made to combine landscape and [[food web]] ecology in such a way that explicitly recognizes the importance of cross-boundary subsidies and spatial features of the landscape on food web dynamics. Often, spatial subsidies are treated as subsidies that simply arrive from outside the patch of interest, not addressing the landscape patterns and processes that may affect the movement of these inputs, such as boundary characteristics and patch connectivity. Polis et al. (1997) published a thorough review of spatially subsidized food web dynamics, focusing on the effect of subsidies on population, [[community]], consumer-resource, and food web dynamics. One of the main conclusions was that subsidies of consumer species (organisms that eat other organisms to obtain energy) resulted in declines of food resources in the recipient patch. Callaway and Hastings (2002) built off Polis et al.’s conclusion with a model to show that subsidized consumers may not always drive down the resource in the recipient patch if consumers move between patches frequently. This might occur because consumers often move for reasons other than food resource acquisition.

Cadenasso et al. (2003) developed a framework for studying ecological boundaries, which has implications for understanding the dynamics of specific cross-boundary subsidies. The boundary is defined as the zone of the steepest gradient of change in some characteristic from one patch to another, such as rapidly decreasing light levels as habitat transitions from a field to a forest. In this framework, flows across variable landscapes are characterized by the type of flow (materials, energy, organisms, etc.), patch contrast (architecture, composition, process), and boundary structure (architecture, composition, symbolic and perceptual features). Considering a cross-boundary subsidy in terms of this framework shows how the boundary itself can mediate the subsidy. For example, Cadenasso and Pickett (2001) found that the decreased lateral vegetation at the boundary between a forest and field increased the amount of seeds transferred into the forest interior.

Another conceptual model that specifically considers cross-boundary subsidies is a model developed by Rand et al. (2006) of spillover from agriculture to wildland patches by predatory insects. The edge is permeable to insects that are habitat generalists and therefore capable of easily crossing the boundary between agriculture and wildland patches, whereas it is considered impermeable to insects that specialize on a particular patch type and cannot cross the boundary. In this model, edge permeability (habitat specialists vs. generalists), patch [[productivity]], and complementary resource use (use of resources obtained in both agriculture and wildland patches) determine the expected impact of cross-boundary subsidies by predatory insects (Fig. 1).

[[Image:Rand2006 adapted.JPG|thumb|'''Figure 1.''' Conceptual model of cross-boundary subsidies of insect predators from agricultural to adjacent wildland patches. '''a.''' Habitat specialization, the boundary is a hard edge to predators such that they do not disperse to the wildland patch. '''b.''' Differences in [[productivity]], increased productivity in the agricultural patch allows a generalist insect predator to disperse to the lower productivity wildland patch. This is an example of a directional positive edge response. '''c.''' Complementary resource use, insect predator abundance is highest near the edge because they need resources present in both patches. This is an example of a reciprocal positive edge response.

==Relation to selected ecological concepts==

===Landscape ecology===
A spatial subsidy, in the context of landscape ecology, is a doner-mediated resource (nutrient, detritus, prey) which is passed from one habitat to a recipient (consumer) in a second habitat. As a result, the productivity of the recipient is increased (Polis et al., 1997). For example, a bear eats a salmon and acquires the resources that have passed through the marine environment across the habitat boundary and into a terrestrial environment.

===Source sink dynamics===
The idea of a subsidy of materials or organisms across a patch boundary affecting resident populations has clear parallels with [[source-sink dynamics]] (Fagan et al. 1999). In this theory, local populations are connected by dispersal, and the extinction of local populations can be prevented through immigration from neighboring patches (Pulliam 1988). In source-sink dynamics, it is assumed that individuals from more productive patches will move to less productive patches with unsustainable populations (Pulliam 1988). Many examples of cross-boundary subsidies can be thought of as exhibiting source-sink dynamics. Rand et al. (2006) found that insects in a high productivity agricultural patch were able to sustain local populations in a lower productivity wildland patch through continued dispersal from the agricultural patch. The effect of these subsidies to local patches can also impact populations of other species in the recipient [[food web]], because the subsidized population may compete with or prey upon other species more effectively than they would be able to without such an influx (Fagan et al. 1999).

===Biotic interactions and trophic structure===
Cross-boundary subsidies have important impacts on species interactions and food web dynamics. Subsidies of materials and organisms can affect all trophic, or feeding, levels of food webs either directly or indirectly. Inputs of nutrient and [[detritus]] from another patch generally increase the population growth of the resident producers (plants) and [[detritus|detritivores]] (Polis et al. 1997). Increased growth at the producer level can result in a bottom-up trophic effect, in which increases in [[populations]] at lower [[trophic level]]s support a higher population of consumers than would otherwise be possible in a closed system (Polis et al. 1997). [[allochthonous]] detrital inputs can also have strong impacts on food web dynamics over a variety of temporal scales, ranging from seconds to millennia, as in the case of [[fossil fuel]] formation from build-up of detritus over millennia (Moore et al. 2004).

====Coarse woody debris====
Many food webs rely on cross-boundary subsidies of detritus for sources of energy and nutrients (Huxel and McCann 1998). For example, a series of lakes in Wisconsin were examined for the presence of [[Coarse woody debris]] (CWD) and the characteristics of the surrounding landscape that might control its input to lakes. Coarse woody debris in these lakes is important for providing habitat and food resources for a variety of organisms including small fish (Werner and Hall 1988), algae, and detritivores (Bowen et al. 1998). Marburg et al. (2006) compared variation within and among lakes in CWD. They found that subsidies of CWD to lakes were lower when the lakes had human development along the shore. Development along the lakeshore can be thought of as an alteration to the characteristics of the patch boundary between the lake and forest. In this case, development decreased both forest density that is the source of CWD and also the permeability of the boundary to flows of CWD (Marburg et al. 2006).

====Predator-prey====
In addition to bottom-up effects, top-down effects may also occur due to cross-boundary subsidies. In top-down effects, subsidies of consumers at the top level of the food web control populations at lower levels more so than would be expected by only the action of resident consumers (Polis et al. 1997). Consumers that cross boundaries may have a greater effect on the recipient patch population if prey in the recipient patch have a lower population growth rate than prey in the source patch (Fagan et al. 1999, Rand et al. 2006). Thus, cross-boundary subsidies may alter predator-prey/competitive interactions that can result in a disproportionate impact on the communities of the recipient patch.

====Trophic cascade====
In subsidizing top trophic levels, effects may also be felt at all lower trophic levels in a phenomenon known as a [[trophic cascade]]. An example of a trophic cascade that also acted as a cross-boundary subsidy is illustrated in a study by Knight et al. (2005) in which changes in the trophic structure of one ecosystem resulted in an effect that cascaded to the adjacent ecosystem. In ponds containing fish, dragonfly larvae were kept to a minimum by fish predation. The resulting low density of adult dragonfly predators led to a high density of bee pollinators. With fish present in adjacent ponds, bees were able to pollinate more flowers in the adjacent upland ecosystem than they were when fish were absent. The dragonfly population could be thought of as subsidized by the absence of fish predation. That subsidy was then transferred across the pond-upland boundary by adult dragonfly movement to affect the interaction between bee pollinators and plants.

===Subsidy cascade===
Native species that forage on resources that don't originate in their same habitat. This may increase their local abundances thereby affecting other species in the ecosystem. For example, Luskin et al (2017) found that native animals living protected primary rainforest in Malaysia found food subsidies in neighboring oil palm plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=9 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsidy allowed native animal populations to increase, which then triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on forest tree community. Specically, crop-raiding wild boar (Sus scofa) built thousands of nests from the forest understory vegatation and this caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over a 24-year study period. Such cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

==Human activities affecting cross-boundary subsidies==

===Agriculture ===
Native species that forage in farmland may increase their local abundances thereby affecting adjacent ecosystems within their landscape. For example, Luskin et al (2017) used two decades of ecological data from a protected primary rainforest in Malaysia to illustrate how subsidies from neighboring oil palm plantations triggered powerful secondary ‘cascading’ effects on natural habitats located &gt;1.3 km away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luskin |first1=Matthew |title=Cross-boundary subsidy cascades from oil palm degrade distant tropical forests |journal=Nature Communications |date=2017 |volume=8 |issue=8 |page=2231 |doi=10.1038/s41467-017-01920-7 |pmid=29263381 |pmc=5738359 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01920-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that (i) oil palm fruit drove 100-fold increases in crop-raiding native wild boar (Sus scrofa), (ii) wild boar used thousands of understory plants to construct birthing nests in the pristine forest interior, and (iii) nest building caused a 62% decline in forest tree sapling density over the 24-year study period. The long-term, landscape-scale indirect effects from agriculture suggest its full ecological footprint may be larger in extent than is currently recognized. Cross-boundary subsidy cascades may be widespread in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems and present significant conservation challenges.

===Fragmentation===
As landscapes become increasingly fragmented due to human activity, the influence of patch boundaries on individual patches becomes relatively more important (Murcia 1995). [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] can both cut off necessary subsidies to patches and increase the magnitude of subsidies from adjacent patches. For example, in a study of fragmentation of wildlands in an agriculturally dominated landscape, subsidies of habitat specialist insects to wildland patches were prevented by surrounding small, wildland patches with inhospitable agricultural land. This isolation reduced the potential for [[gene flow]] and long-term persistence of the population. Subsidies of other insects that specialized on agricultural crops were increased to wildland [[populations]], increasing their effect on the resident wildland species (Duelli 1990).

===Alteration of patch and boundary characteristics===
Changing the internal structure and composition of a patch may substantially alter cross-boundary subsidies. [[Logging]] may temporarily increase subsidies of nutrients and detritus to adjacent streams (Likens et al. 1970). [[Invasive species]] introduced to agricultural patches may act as a subsidy to adjacent wildland invasive populations, preventing native species establishment, even within the protected area (Janzen 1983).

====Marine systems====
Human alterations of patch characteristics may also curtail cross-boundary subsidies such as [[overfishing]] in marine systems, which may drastically reduce potentially crucial marine subsidies of organisms to freshwater and riparian systems (Zhang et al. 2003). For example, Helfield and Naiman (2002) found that riparian trees in [[Alaska]] obtain 24-26% of their nitrogen from marine sources, transferred from migrating [[salmon]]. In this system, [[salmon]] that feed in the ocean, incorporating marine nitrogen into their biomass, later return to their natal small streams where they spawn and die. [[Salmon]] carcasses transferred across the stream-riparian zone boundary by terrestrial predators or flooding events subsidized growth of terrestrial plants. Thus, marine overfishing may affect the productivity of Alaskan forests that depend on subsidies of marine-derived nitrogen.

As discussed above, cross-boundary subsidies depend on the characteristics of the patch boundary. Human-induced changes in these characteristics can affect boundary permeability to certain organisms or materials. For example, a cross-boundary subsidy of leaf litter from forest to an adjacent open field may be attenuated at the boundary if a road is present, making the boundary less permeable to flows of leaf litter (Facelli and Pickett 1991).

==Implications for management and future research needs==
Habitat management might benefit from recognizing the effect that humans may have on both individual patches and on the dynamics between patches. In such cases, managers may need to focus on patterns and processes that occur outside of their patch of interest, as these factors may also be important to internal [[population dynamics]]. An understanding of boundary features that influence the various flows of interest is necessary in managing for those flows.

=== Invasive species ===
The implications of [[invasive species]] and the use of [[biological control]] agents may also be closely related to the idea of cross-boundary subsidies. Introducing species into one patch for [[biocontrol]] may have unforeseen consequences on dynamics within adjacent patches.

Other fields, such as public policy, can also benefit from considering cross-boundary subsidies. For example, governments often provide [[subsidy|financial subsidies]] to [[fisheries]], which have a negative effect on those ecosystems by encouraging overfishing (Munro and Sumaila 2002). Understanding what processes affect how those financial resources flow across that particular government-industry boundary is important to the maintenance of marine [[food web]]s. Considering cross-boundary effects will be essential to a complete understanding of potential consequences of human action on the landscape.

'''Digital painting''' is an emerging art form in which traditional painting techniques such as [[watercolor]], [[Oil paint|oils]], [[impasto]], etc. are applied using digital tools by means of a [[computer]], a [[digitizing tablet]] and [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]], and [[software]]. Traditional painting is painting with a physical medium as opposed to a more modern style like digital. Digital painting differs from other forms of [[digital art]], particularly [[computer-generated art]], in that it does not involve the computer rendering from a model.  The artist uses painting techniques to create the digital painting directly on the computer. All digital painting programs try to mimic the use of physical media through various brushes and paint effects.  Included in many programs are brushes that are digitally styled to represent the traditional style like oils, acrylics, pastels, charcoal, pen and even media such as airbrushing.  There are also certain effects unique to each type of digital paint which portray the realistic effects of say watercolor on a digital 'watercolor' painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corel.com/servlet/ContentServer/us/en/Product/1166553941991&lt;/ref&gt; In most digital painting programs, the users can create their own brush style using a combination of texture and shape.  This ability is very important in bridging the gap between traditional and digital painting.

Digital painting thrives mostly in production art. It is most widely used in conceptual design for film, television and video games. Digital painting software such as [[Corel Painter]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[ArtRage]], [[GIMP]], [[Krita]] and [[openCanvas]] give artists a similar environment to a physical painter: a canvas, painting tools, mixing palettes, and a multitude of color options.
There are various types of digital painting, including [[impressionism]], realism, and watercolor. There are both benefits and drawbacks of digital painting.  While digital painting allows the artist the ease of working in an organized, mess-free environment, some argue there will always be more control for an artist holding a physical brush in their hand. Some artists believe there is something missing from digital painting, such as the character that is unique to every physically made object.  Many artists post blogs and comment on the various differences between digitally created work and traditionally created artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vindicated13.wordpress.com/2007/11/13/art-traditional-vs-digital/ Art: Traditional vs. Digital « Vindicated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.deviantart.com/galleries/digital/1061392/ deviantART Forum: Traditional painting vs Digital painting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with traditional painting==

The main difference between digital and traditional painting is the non-linear process. That is, an artist can often arrange his painting in layers that can be edited independently. Also, the ability to undo and redo strokes frees the artist from a linear process. But digital painting is limited in how it employs the techniques and study of a traditional painter because of the surface differences and lack of physicality. The [[digital artist]] has at his disposal several tools not available to the traditional painter.  Some of these include: a virtual palette consisting of millions of colors, almost any size canvas or media, and the ability to take back mistakes, as well as erasers, pencils, spray cans, brushes, combs, and a variety of 2D and 3D effect tools.  A [[graphics tablet]] allows the artist to work with precise hand movements simulating a real pen and drawing surface. Even the traditional surface has changed for digital painting. Instead of a canvas or sketchbook, artists would use a mouse or tablet to display strokes that would appear with the touch of a pen to the tablet’s surface, or a click of pen.  Tablets can be pressure sensitive, allowing the artist to vary the intensity of the chosen media on the screen.  There are tablets with over two thousand different levels of pressure sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wacom.com/intuos/12x19.cfm Intuos3 12x19 - Product Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===Sketchpad===
[[Image:Wacom Pen-tablet.jpg|thumb|Many artists prefer using graphics tablets to create digital paintings instead of using a mouse.]]
The earliest graphical manipulation program was called [[Sketchpad]].  Created in 1963 by [[Ivan Sutherland]], a grad student at [[MIT]], Sketchpad allowed the user to manipulate objects on a CRT ([[cathode ray tube]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitepoint.com/article/real-history-gui/4 The Real History of the GUI [Design Principles&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sketchpad eventually led to the creation of the Rand Tablet for work on the GRAIL project in 1968, and the very first tablet was created.  Other early tablets, or digitizers, like the ID (intelligent digitizer) and the BitPad were commercially successful and used in CAD (Computer Aided Design) programs. Modern day tablets are the tools of choice by digital painters.  WACOM is the industry leader in tablets which can range in size from 4” x 6” all the way to 12” x 19” and are less than an inch thick. Other brands of graphic tablets are Aiptek, Monoprice, Hanvon, Genius, Adesso, Trust, Manhattan, Vistablet, DigiPro, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://0.tqn.com/d/performingarts/1/0/9/7/-/-/GraphicsTabletComparisonChart.jpg Comparison chart of graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://painting.about.com/lr/graphics_tablet/1917/1/ Links to many graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/aboutgraphics/a/graphicstablets.htm Sue Chastain, editor about graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;
All these graphic tablets have the basic functions of a mouse, so they can be used as a mouse, not only in graphic editors but also as a replacement for a mouse, and they are compatible with practically all Windows and Macintosh software.

===Tablets===
The idea of using a [[graphics tablet|tablet]] to communicate directions to a computer has been an idea since 1968 when the RAND (Research and Development) company out of Santa Monica, developed the [[RAND tablet]] that was used to program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/research/videohistory_catalog9536.html Smithsonian Institution Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Digitizers were popularized in the mid 1970s and early 1980s by the commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitizer) and BitPad manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp. These digitizers were used as the input device for many high-end [[CAD]] ([[Computer Aided Design]]) systems as well as bundled with [[Personal computer|PC]]'s and PC based CAD software like [[AutoCAD]].

===MacPaint===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:MacpaintWP.png|thumb|MacPaint 1.0]] --&gt;
The first commercial program that allowed users to design, draw, and manipulate objects was the program [[MacPaint]]. This program’s first version was introduced on January 22, 1984 on the [[Apple Lisa]].  The ability to freehand draw and create graphics with this program made it the top program of its kind during 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/31/science/personal-computers-software-for-the-macintosh-plenty-on-the-way.html?sec=technology&amp;pagewanted=2 Personal Computers; Software For The Macintosh: Plenty On The Way - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   The earlier versions of the program were called MacSketch and LisaSketch, and the last version of MacPaint was MacPaint 2.0 released in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4BlmsN4q2I&amp;feature=related YouTube - Apple Lisa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of MacPaint's universal success was attributed to the release of the first Macintosh computer which was equipped with one other program called [[MacWrite]].  It was the first personal computer with a graphical user interface and lost much of the bulky size of its predecessor, the Lisa.  The Macintosh was available at about $2500 and the combination of a smaller design made the computer a hit, exposing the average computer user to the graphical possibilities of the included MacPaint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitepoint.com/article/real-history-gui/5- The Real History of the GUI [Design Principles&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adobe===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended.png|thumb|Adobe Photoshop CS3]] --&gt;
Another early image manipulation program was [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It was first called Display and was created in 1987 by [[Thomas Knoll]] at the [[University of Michigan]] as monochrome picture display program.  With help from his brother John, the program was turned into an image editing program called Imagepro, but later changed to Photoshop.  The Knolls agreed on a deal with [[Adobe systems]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and Photoshop 1.0 was released in 1991 for Macintosh. [[Adobe systems]] had previously release Adobe Illustrator 1.0 in 1986 on the Apple Macintosh. These two programs, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are currently two of the top programs used in the productions of digital paintings.  Illustrator introduced the uses of [[Bezier curves]] which allowed the user to be incredibly detailed in their [[vector graphics|vector drawings]].

===Kid Pix===
In 1988, Craig Hickman created a paint program called [[Kid Pix]], which made it easier for children to use MacPaint. The program was originally created in black in white, and after several revisions was released in color in 1991.  Kid Pix was one of the first commercial programs to integrate color and sound in a creative format. While the Kid Pix was intentionally created for children, it became a useful tool for introducing adults to the computer as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pixelpoppin.com/kidpix/ Kid Pix: The Early Years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web-based painting programs===
In recent years there has been a growth in the websites which support  painting digitally online. 
The user is still drawing digitally with the use of software: often the software is on the server of the website which is being used. However, with the emergence of html5, some programs now partly use the client's web browser to handle some of the processing. The range of tools and brushes can be more limited than free standing software. Speed of response, quality of colour and the ability to save to a file or print are similar in either media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">'''Drumming out''' is the historical act of being [[Military discharge#Dishonorable|dishonorably dismissed from military service]] to the sound of a drum. In modern figurative usage, in which the term is sometimes altered to "drub[bing/bed/etc.] out," it may refer to any act of expulsion or dismissal in disgrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/drummed+out|title=Drum|publisher=thefreedictionary.com|accessdate=2008-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bodleian Libraries, Drumming out of the French army (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|alt=Satirical cartoon of depicting Napoleon being drummed out|Satirical cartoon representing Napoleon's exile to Elba.]]
==Origin==
One of the earliest recorded references to drumming out occurs in [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[Moral Essays]]'', 3rd epistle, 1731–1733: "Chartres was a man infamous for all manner of vices. When he was an ensign in the army, he was drummed out of the regiment for a cheat; he was next banished Brussels, and drummed out of Ghent, on the same account."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbBXAAAAYAAJ|publisher=books.google.com|title=The Works of Alexander Pope, Esq: Moral essays|accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also occurs in a figurative sense in [[Thomas Amory (author)|Thomas Amory]]'s  1766 ''Life of John Buncle'': "They ought to be drummed out of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/124700.html|publisher=phrases.org.uk|title=Drummed out of the army|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Revolutionary War==
The earliest known discharge of an American soldier involved the drumming out of [[Lieutenant]] [[Frederick Gotthold Enslin]] for attempted [[sodomy]] in March of 1778 during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The diary of Lieutenant James McMichael contains a record of the sentence being carried out: 

{{blockquote|"March 15. — I this morning proceeded to the grand parade, where I was a spectator to the drumming out of Lieut. Enslin of Col. Malcom's regiment. He was first drum'd from right to left of the parade, thence to the left wing of the army; from that to the centre, and lastly transported over the [[Schuylkill River|Schuylkill]] with orders never to be seen in Camp in the future. This shocking scene was performed by all the drums and fifes in the army—the coat of the [[wikt:delinquent|delinquent]] was turned wrong side out."&lt;ref&gt;James McMichael, ''[https://archive.org/stream/pennsylvaniaarc22penngoog#page/n231/mode/1up/search/enslin Pennsylvania Archives (Second Series)]'', William Henry Egle, ed., v.15, Harrisburg, PA: E.K. Meyers, State Printer, 1890. p.&amp;nbsp;217&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The sentencing order, approved by [[George Washington]], called for Enslin to be drummed out, never to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Washington Drummed Out Soldier for 'Infamous Crime' of Attempted ‘Sodomy’|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/george-washington-drummed-out-soldier-infamous-crime-attempted-sodomy|website=CNS News|date=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American Civil War==
[[American Civil War]] officers drummed out of service might have their heads shaved and their uniforms [[Cashiering|stripped of insignia]] and be paraded in front of their comrades.  Fellow officers were forbidden to touch the person being dishonorably discharged, but in more than one case after the war had ended, a drummed-out man was found dead after receiving a beating from his former comrades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.floridareenactorsonline.com/crimespunishments2.htm|publisher=floridareenactorsonline.cm|accessdate=2008-09-10|title=Crimes And Punishments In The Civil War|author=Robert Niepert|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813114136/http://www.floridareenactorsonline.com/crimespunishments2.htm|archivedate=2009-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When someone was being drummed out, the tune "Rogue's March" would be played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/civil-war/1861/june/albany-new-york.htm|accessdate=2008-09-11|title=Civil War Harper's Weekly, June 1, 1861|work=[[Harper's Weekly]]|quote=Drumming out Albany volunteers who refused to take the oath.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
The opening to the 1965 NBC series [[Branded (TV series)|''Branded'']] used the ceremony in its opening credits.

In the 1983 film [[The Lords of Discipline (film)|''The Lords of Discipline'']], one of the main characters is dismissed from the fictional Carolina Military Institute in such a ceremony.

In the ''[[Married... With Children]]'' episode "All-Nite Security Dude," Al is drummed out of his position as school security guard.

In season 4 episode 2 of AMC series ''[[Turn: Washington's Spies]]'' a soldier's wife is drummed out of camp and loses her privileges as a camp follower for refusing to wash clothes for the army.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4974">'''ETIM Deutschland e. V.''' (''ElektroTechnisches InformationsModell'', or electro-technical information model) is an initiative to [[Standardization|standardize]] the electronic exchange of [[Product data management|product data]] for electrical and electronic products (electrical installation products, home appliances and consumer electronics) to enable the electronic trading of these products. The standard is designed to meet the requirements of the electrical industry and allows for the uniform, technical description of electrical goods and their assignment to a class of products.

== ETIM classification ==
The ETIM Classification model is built using the following categories or entities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification|url=http://www.etim-international.com/classification|publisher=ETIM International|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Product groups
* Product classes
* Synonyms (Keywords)
* Features
* Values
* Units

The product groups each contain a set of product classes associated by theme. A product class can only be assigned to one product group. Within the product class, comparable or "alike" products are classified together. The name of an product class can have synonyms assigned in order to specify alternative names for the product class. The same synonym can be assigned to more than one product class. Each product class is assigned a list of features that unambiguously describe the product. This creates the ETIM classification.

This [[standardization]] allows suppliers of electrical goods to be found on the basis of class name (including synonyms) or of technical features.

== Release Format ==

The content of the ETIM model is identical in all member countries, which means that any ETIM class in use in a country has exactly the same features with the same identifying code for all the countries. However, in the past the release format was slightly different per country. Because this could and did indeed cause some confusion, ETIM decided to develop a new uniform international release format based on XML, a modern and flexible carrier for the ETIM model. Starting from ETIM 6.0 ETIM IXF will be considered THE international standard ETIM release format. The ETIM IXF format is multilingual, so it can contain multiple language versions of the ETIM model in one file. For the complete and detailed format description we refer to the separate document on ETIM IXF, which you can find in the download section of this website.

Every country can still decide to have additional country-specific release formats. The ETIM CMT master database already supports a range of exports formats like ASCII (TXT), CSV, ACCESS and EXCEL. Please contact your local ETIM organization for more information on country specific formats in your country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ETIM Releases|url=http://www.etim-international.com/classification|publisher=ETIM International|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exchange Format Product Data ==

The ETIM data model is completely uniform, differing only in the language.

The exchange format for classified product data, not to be confused with the release format for the data model, however is set and defined by each local ETIM organization individually. ETIM International recommends the BMEcat® standard, which is the most common exchange format within the ETIM countries. However, in some countries specific national formats are still in use and accepted as sector standard, sometimes in addition to BMEcat®.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exchange format product data|url=http://www.etim-international.com/classification|publisher=ETIM International|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ETIM versions ==
* The "ETIM Clearing Center - Specification Product Data Exchange Format Version 1.02" uses BMEcat 1.01 as the basis.
* ETIM BMEcat 1.2 contains the ETIM-2.0 specification and is adapted to BMEcat 1.2. 
* ETIM version 3.0, 30 May 2005, in German and English. 
* ETIM version 4.0, 15 January 2008, in German, English and Dutch. 
* On 27 March 2008, a corrected version was published. The changes apply only to some units.
* ETIM version 5.0, May 2011.
* ETIM version 6.0, 29 April 2014, in German, English and Dutch.
* ETIM version 7.0, 4 September 2017, in English and Dutch (for the electrical and HVAC/sanitary sector also in French and German)

== Cooperation with other organizations ==
Since 1 January 2006 ETIM is a member of [[Eclass|eCl@ss]] and vice versa. eCl@ss is the equivalent of ETIM in for field machines and [[plant construction]]. Both organizations have set a goal of unifying the classifications to a standard and are working together with the organizations [[VDMA]], [[ZVEI]], and the [[DIN]].

== Industrial products and services categorization standards ==

* ETIM (standard)
* [[UNSPSC]]
* [[eOTD]]
* [[RosettaNet]]
* [[TUN (product standard)|TUN]]

The '''Eiao Marquesan warbler''' (''Acrocephalus percernis aquilonis'') is a [[subspecies]] of the [[northern Marquesan reed warbler]] found only in the dry upland [[forest]] on [[Eiao]] in the northern [[Marquesas Islands]].

The species comprises several different races, each of which occupies a variety of forest or [[The Bush|bush]]land habitats.
&lt;!-- what does that mean? aquilonis is itself a race=subspecies! --&gt;

Because of extensive habitat destruction by [[feral]] [[goat]]s, [[sheep]] and [[pig]]s, the subspecies is [[endangered species|endangered]], and may very well be [[extinct]].

The total population was estimated at approximately 100-200 individuals in 1987.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31246">In [[mathematics]], the '''Enriques–Kodaira classification''' is a classification of [[compact space|compact]] [[complex surface]]s into ten classes. For each of these classes, the surfaces in the class can be parametrized by a [[moduli space]]. For most of the classes the moduli spaces are well understood, but for the class of surfaces of general type the moduli spaces seem too complicated to describe explicitly, though some components are known.

[[Max Noether]] began the systematic study of algebraic surfaces, and [[Guido Castelnuovo]] proved important parts of the classification. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Federigo Enriques|first=Federigo |last=Enriques|year=1914|year2=1949}} described the classification of complex projective surfaces. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Kunihiko Kodaira|first=Kunihiko |last=Kodaira|year1=1964|year2=1966|year3=1968|year4=1968b}} later extended the classification to include non-algebraic compact surfaces.
The analogous classification of  surfaces in characteristic ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 was begun by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=David Mumford|first=David |last=Mumford|year=1969}} and completed by {{harvs|txt|author1-link=Enrico Bombieri |first=Enrico |last=Bombieri|first2=David |last2=Mumford|year1=1976|year2=1977}}; it is similar to the characteristic 0 projective case, except that one also gets singular and supersingular Enriques surfaces in characteristic 2, and quasi-hyperelliptic surfaces in characteristics 2 and 3.

==Statement of the classification==
[[File:Geography of surfaces.jpg|thumb|500px|Chern numbers of minimal complex surfaces]]
The Enriques–Kodaira classification of compact complex surfaces states that every nonsingular minimal compact complex surface
is of exactly one of the 10 types listed on this page; in other words, it is one of the rational, ruled (genus &amp;gt;0), type VII, K3, Enriques,  Kodaira, toric, hyperelliptic, properly quasi-elliptic, or general type surfaces.

For the 9 classes of surfaces other than general type, there is a fairly complete description of what all the surfaces look like (which for class VII depends on the [[global spherical shell conjecture]], still unproved in 2009). For surfaces of general type not much is known about their explicit classification, though many examples have been found.

The classification of algebraic surfaces in positive characteristics ({{harvnb|Mumford|1969}}, {{harvs|nb|last=Mumford|last2=Bombieri|year1=1976|year2=1977}}) is similar to that of algebraic surfaces in characteristic 0, except that there are no Kodaira surfaces or surfaces of type VII, and there are some extra families of Enriques surfaces in characteristic 2, and  hyperelliptic surfaces in characteristics 2 and 3, and in Kodaira dimension 1 in characteristics 2 and 3 one also allows quasielliptic fibrations. These extra families can be understood as follows: In characteristic 0 these surfaces are the quotients of  surfaces by finite groups, but in finite characteristics it is also possible to take quotients by finite [[group scheme]]s that are not [[étale group scheme|étale]].

[[Oscar Zariski]] constructed some  surfaces in positive characteristic  that are unirational but not rational, derived from [[inseparable extension]]s ([[Zariski surface]]s). In positive characteristic Serre showed that ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) may differ from ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(''O''), and Igusa showed that even when they are equal they may be greater than the irregularity (the dimension of the Picard variety).

==Invariants of surfaces==

===Hodge numbers and Kodaira dimension===
The most important invariants of a compact complex surfaces used in the classification can be given in terms of the dimensions of various [[coherent sheaf cohomology]] groups. The basic ones are the [[plurigenera]] and the Hodge numbers defined as follows:

*''K'' is the [[canonical sheaf|canonical line bundle]] whose sections are the holomorphic 2-forms.
*''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' =&amp;nbsp;dim&amp;nbsp;H&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(''K''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) for ''n'' ≥ 1 are the '''plurigenera'''. They are [[birational]] invariants, i.e. invariant under blowing up. Using Seiberg–Witten theory Friedman and Morgan showed that for complex manifolds they only depend on the underlying oriented smooth 4-manifold. For non-Kähler surfaces the plurigenera are determined by the fundamental group, but for [[Kähler manifold|Kähler surfaces]] there are examples of surfaces that are homeomorphic but have different plurigenera and Kodaira dimensions. The individual plurigenera are not often used; the most important thing about them is their growth rate, measured by the [[Kodaira dimension]].
* κ is the '''[[Kodaira dimension]]''': it is &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes written −1) if the plurigenera are all 0, and is otherwise the smallest number (0, 1, or 2 for surfaces) such that ''P&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''/''n''&lt;sup&gt;κ&lt;/sup&gt; is bounded. Enriques did not use this definition: instead he used the values of ''P''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K.K = c_1^2.&lt;/math&gt; These determine the Kodaira dimension, since Kodaira dimension &lt;math&gt;\kappa = -\infty&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, κ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 corresponds to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, κ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 corresponds to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 and ''K''.''K''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, while κ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 corresponds to ''P''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 and ''K''.''K''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0.
*''h''&lt;sup&gt;''i'',''j''&lt;/sup&gt; = dim H&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', Ω&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;), where Ω&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; is the sheaf of [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] ''i''-forms, are the '''[[Hodge number]]s''', often arranged in the Hodge diamond
{{Hodge diamond
| ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,0&lt;/sup&gt;
| ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; | ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;
| ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2,0&lt;/sup&gt; | ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt; | ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,2&lt;/sup&gt;
| ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2,1&lt;/sup&gt; | ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt;
| ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2,2&lt;/sup&gt;
}}
By [[Serre duality]] ''h&lt;sup&gt;i,j&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2−''i'',2−''j''&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;0,0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2,2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1. If the surface is [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]] then ''h&lt;sup&gt;i,j&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''h&lt;sup&gt;j,i&lt;/sup&gt;'', so there are only 3 independent Hodge numbers.
For compact complex surfaces ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; is either ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; or ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. The first plurigenus ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to the Hodge numbers ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2,0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,2&lt;/sup&gt;, and is sometimes called the geometric genus. The Hodge numbers of a complex surface depend only on the oriented real [[cohomology]] ring of the surface, and are invariant under birational transformations except for ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt; which increases by 1 under blowing up a single point.

===Invariants related to Hodge numbers===
There are many invariants that (at least for complex surfaces) can be written as linear combinations of the Hodge numbers, as follows:

* ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are the '''[[Betti number]]s''': ''b''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = dim(''H''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;(''S'')). ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; + ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2,1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2,0&lt;/sup&gt; + ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,2&lt;/sup&gt;. In characteristic ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 the Betti numbers (defined using [[l-adic cohomology]]) need not be related in this way to Hodge numbers.
*''e'' = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''[[Euler characteristic]]''' or '''Euler number'''.
*''q'' is the '''[[irregularity of a surface|irregularity]]''', the dimension of the [[Picard variety]] and the [[Albanese variety]], which for complex surfaces (but not always for surfaces of prime characteristic) is ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;.
*''p&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;2,0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;is the '''[[geometric genus]]'''.
*''p&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''q'' = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; is the '''[[arithmetic genus]]'''.
*χ = ''p&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is the '''[[holomorphic Euler characteristic]]''' of the trivial bundle. (It usually differs from the Euler number ''e'' defined above.) By [[Noether's formula]] it is also equal to the [[Todd genus]] (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/12
*τ is the '''signature''' (of the second cohomology group for complex surfaces) and is equal to 4χ−''e'', which is &lt;math&gt;\sum\nolimits_{i,j}(-1)^j h^{i,j}.&lt;/math&gt;
*''b''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; are the dimensions of the maximal positive and negative definite subspaces of ''H''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so ''b''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt; = ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; = τ.
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''e'' and &lt;math&gt;c_1^2 = K^2 = 12\chi - e&lt;/math&gt; are the '''[[Chern number]]s''', defined as the integrals of various polynomials in the [[Chern class]]es over the manifold.

For complex surfaces the invariants above defined in terms of Hodge numbers depend only on the underlying oriented topological manifold.

===Other invariants===
There are further invariants of compact complex surfaces that are not used so much in the classification. These include algebraic invariants such as the '''[[Picard group]]''' Pic(''X'') of divisors modulo [[linear equivalence]], its quotient the '''[[Néron–Severi group]]''' NS(''X'') with rank the [[Picard number]] ρ, topological invariants such as the '''[[fundamental group]]''' π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the integral homology and cohomology groups, and invariants of the underlying smooth [[4-manifold]] such as the [[Seiberg–Witten invariant]]s and [[Donaldson invariant]]s.

==Minimal models and blowing up==

Any surface is birational to a non-singular surface, so for most purposes it is enough to classify the non-singular surfaces.

Given any point on a surface, we can form a new surface by [[blowing up]] this point, which means roughly that we replace it by a copy of the projective line. For the purpose of this article, a non-singular surface ''X'' is called '''minimal''' if it cannot be obtained from another non-singular surface by blowing up a point. By [[Castelnuovo's contraction theorem]], this is equivalent to saying that ''X'' has no (−1)-curves (smooth rational curves with self-intersection number −1). (In the more modern terminology of the [[minimal model program]], a smooth projective surface ''X'' would be called '''minimal''' if its canonical line bundle ''K&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is [[nef line bundle|nef]]. A smooth projective surface has a minimal model in that stronger sense if and only if its Kodaira dimension is nonnegative.)

Every surface ''X'' is birational to a minimal non-singular surface, and this minimal non-singular surface is unique if ''X'' has Kodaira dimension at least 0 or is not algebraic. Algebraic surfaces of Kodaira dimension &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; may be birational to more than one minimal non-singular surface, but it is easy to describe the relation between these minimal surfaces. For example, '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; blown up at a point is isomorphic to '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; blown up twice. So to classify all compact  complex surfaces up to birational isomorphism it is (more or less) enough to classify the minimal non-singular ones.

==Surfaces of Kodaira dimension &amp;minus;∞==

Algebraic surfaces of Kodaira dimension &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; can be classified as follows.
If ''q'' &amp;gt; 0 then the map to the Albanese variety has fibers that are projective lines (if the surface is minimal) so the surface is a ruled surface. If ''q'' = 0 this argument does not work as the Albanese variety is a point, but in this case [[rational surface|Castelnuovo's theorem]] implies that the surface is rational.

For non-algebraic surfaces Kodaira found an extra class of surfaces, called type VII, which are still not well understood.

===Rational surfaces===

[[Rational surface]] means surface birational to the [[complex projective plane]] '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. These are all algebraic. The minimal rational surfaces are '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; itself and the [[Hirzebruch surface]]s Σ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; for ''n'' = 0 or ''n'' ≥ 2. (The Hirzebruch surface Σ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; bundle over '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; associated to the sheaf O(0)+O(n). The surface Σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and Σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; blown up at a point so is not minimal.)

'''Invariants:''' The plurigenera are all 0 and the fundamental group is trivial.

Many of these examples are non-minimal.

===Ruled surfaces of genus &gt;&amp;nbsp;0===

Ruled surfaces of genus ''g'' have a smooth morphism to a curve of genus ''g'' whose fibers are lines '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. They are all algebraic.
(The ones of genus 0 are the Hirzebruch surfaces and are rational.) Any ruled surface is birationally equivalent to '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;''C'' for a unique curve ''C'', so the classification of ruled surfaces up to birational equivalence is essentially the same as the classification of curves. A ruled surface not isomorphic to '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; has a unique ruling ('''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;times;'''P'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; has two).

===Surfaces of class VII===
{{main article|Surface of class VII}}
These surfaces are never algebraic or [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]]. The minimal ones with ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=0 have been classified by Bogomolov, and are either [[Hopf surface]]s or [[Inoue surface]]s. Examples with positive second Betti number include [[Inoue-Hirzebruch surface]]s, [[Enoki surface]]s, and more generally [[Kato surface]]s. The [[global spherical shell conjecture]] implies that all minimal class VII surfaces with positive second Betti number are Kato surfaces, which would more or less complete the classification of the type VII surfaces.

'''Invariants:''' ''q''=1, ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; = 0. All plurigenera are 0.

==Surfaces of Kodaira dimension 0==

These surfaces are classified by starting with Noether's formula &lt;math&gt;12\chi = c_2 + c_1^2.&lt;/math&gt; For Kodaira dimension 0, ''K'' has zero [[Self-intersection number|intersection number with itself]], so &lt;math&gt;c_1^2 = 0.&lt;/math&gt; Using χ= ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,0&lt;/sup&gt; − ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 − 2''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;10+12h^{0,2} = 8 h^{0,1} + 2 \left (2h^{0,1} - b_1 + b_2 \right )&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover since κ = 0 we have:

:&lt;math&gt;h^{0,2} = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; K= 0 \\0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

combining this with the previous equation gives:

:&lt;math&gt;8 h^{0,1} + 2 \left (2h^{0,1} - b_1 + b_2 \right ) = \begin{cases} 10 &amp; K= 0 \\22 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

In general 2''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so three terms on the left are non-negative integers and there are only a few solutions to this equation. For algebraic surfaces  2''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is an even integer between 0 and 2''p&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'', while for compact complex surfaces it is 0 or 1, and is 0 for [[Kähler manifold|Kähler surfaces]]. For [[Kähler manifold|Kähler surfaces]] we have ''h''&lt;sup&gt;1,0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;0,1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Most solutions to these conditions correspond to classes of surfaces, as in the following table:

===K3 surfaces===
These are the minimal compact complex surfaces of Kodaira dimension 0 with ''q'' = 0 and trivial canonical line bundle. They are all [[Kähler manifold]]s. All K3 surfaces are diffeomorphic, and their diffeomorphism class is an important example of a smooth spin simply connected 4-manifold.

'''Invariants:'''  The second cohomology group ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', '''Z''') is isomorphic to the unique even [[unimodular lattice]] II&lt;sub&gt;3,19&lt;/sub&gt; of dimension 22 and signature &amp;minus;16.

*[[Kummer surface]]s. These are obtained by ''quotienting out'' an abelian surface by the automorphism ''a'' → −''a'', then blowing up the 16 singular points.

A '''marked''' K3 surface is a K3 surface together with an isomorphism from II&lt;sub&gt;3,19&lt;/sub&gt; to ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', '''Z'''). The moduli space of marked K3 surfaces is connected non-Hausdorff smooth analytic space of dimension 20. The algebraic K3 surfaces form a countable collection of 19-dimensional subvarieties of it.

===Abelian surfaces and 2-dimensional complex tori===

The two-dimensional [[complex tori]] include the [[abelian surface]]s. One-dimensional complex tori are just elliptic curves and are all algebraic, but Riemann discovered that most complex tori of dimension 2 are not algebraic. The algebraic ones are exactly the 2-dimensional [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]].
Most of their theory is a special case of the theory of higher-dimensional tori or abelian varieties. Criteria to be a product of two elliptic curves (up to [[isogeny]]) were a popular study in the nineteenth century.

'''Invariants:''' The plurigenera are all 1. The surface is diffeomorphic to ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; so the fundamental group is '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Kodaira surfaces===
{{main article|Kodaira surface}}
These are never algebraic, though they have non-constant meromorphic functions. They are usually divided into two subtypes: '''primary Kodaira surfaces''' with trivial canonical bundle, and '''secondary Kodaira surfaces''' which are quotients of these by finite groups of orders 2, 3, 4, or 6, and which have non-trivial canonical bundles. The secondary Kodaira surfaces have the same relation to primary ones that Enriques surfaces have to K3 surfaces, or bielliptic surfaces have to abelian surfaces.

Invariants: If the surface is the quotient of a primary Kodaira surface by a group of order ''k''=1,2,3,4,6, then the plurigenera ''P''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are 1 if ''n'' is divisible by ''k'' and 0 otherwise.

'''Examples:''' Take a non-trivial line bundle over an elliptic curve, remove the zero section, then quotient out the fibers by '''Z''' acting as multiplication by powers of some complex number ''z''. This gives a primary Kodaira surface.

===Enriques surfaces===

{{main article|Enriques surface}}
These are the complex surfaces such that ''q'' = 0 and the canonical line bundle is non-trivial, but has trivial square. Enriques surfaces are all algebraic (and therefore [[Kähler manifold|Kähler]]). They are quotients of K3 surfaces by a group of order 2 and their theory is similar to that of algebraic K3 surfaces.

'''Invariants:''' The plurigenera ''P''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are 1 if ''n'' is even and 0 if ''n'' is odd. The fundamental group has order 2. The second cohomology group H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', '''Z''') is isomorphic to the sum of the unique even [[unimodular lattice]] II&lt;sub&gt;1,9&lt;/sub&gt; of dimension 10 and signature -8 and a group of order 2.

Marked Enriques surfaces form a connected 10-dimensional family, which has been described explicitly.

In characteristic 2 there are some extra families of Enriques surfaces called singular and supersingular Enriques surfaces; see the article on [[Enriques surface]]s for details.

===Hyperelliptic (or bielliptic) surfaces===
{{main article|hyperelliptic surface}}
Over the complex numbers these are quotients of a product of two elliptic curves by a finite group of automorphisms. The finite group can be '''Z'''/2'''Z''', '''Z'''/2'''Z'''+'''Z'''/2'''Z''', '''Z'''/3'''Z''', '''Z'''/3'''Z'''+'''Z'''/3'''Z''', '''Z'''/4'''Z''', '''Z'''/4'''Z'''+'''Z'''/2'''Z''', or '''Z'''/6'''Z''', giving 7 families of such surfaces. Over fields of characteristics 2 or 3 there are some extra families given by taking quotients by a non-etale group scheme; see the article on [[hyperelliptic surface]]s for details.

==Surfaces of Kodaira dimension 1 ==

An [[elliptic surface]] is a surface equipped with an elliptic fibration (a surjective holomorphic map to a curve ''B'' such that all but finitely many fibers are smooth irreducible curves of genus 1).   The generic fiber in such a fibration is a genus 1 curve over the function field of ''B''.  Conversely, given a genus 1 curve over the function field of a curve, its relative minimal model is an elliptic surface.   Kodaira and others have given a fairly complete description of all elliptic surfaces. In particular, Kodaira gave a [[Elliptic surface#Kodaira's table of singular fibers|complete list of the possible singular fibers]].  The theory of elliptic surfaces is analogous to the theory of proper regular models of elliptic curves over [[discrete valuation ring]]s (e.g., the ring of [[p-adic integer|''p''-adic integers]]) and [[Dedekind domain]]s (e.g., the ring of integers of a number field).

In finite characteristic 2 and 3 one can also get  '''quasi-elliptic''' surfaces, whose fibers may almost all be rational curves with a single node, which are "degenerate elliptic curves".

Every surface of [[Kodaira dimension]] 1 is an elliptic surface (or a quasielliptic surface in characteristics 2 or 3),
but the converse is not true: an elliptic surface can have Kodaira dimension &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt;, 0, or 1.
All [[Enriques surface]]s, all [[hyperelliptic surface]]s, all [[Kodaira surface]]s, some [[K3 surface]]s, some [[abelian surface]]s, and some [[rational surface]]s are elliptic surfaces, and these examples have Kodaira dimension less than 1.
An elliptic surface whose base curve ''B'' is of genus at least 2 always has Kodaira dimension 1, but the Kodaira dimension can be 1 also for some elliptic surfaces with ''B'' of genus 0 or 1.

'''Invariants:''' ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;≥ 0.

'''Example:''' If ''E'' is an elliptic curve and ''B'' is a curve of genus at least 2, then ''E''×''B'' is an elliptic surface of Kodaira dimension 1.

==Surfaces of Kodaira dimension 2 (surfaces of general type)==
{{main article|Surface of general type}}

These are all algebraic, and in some sense most surfaces are in this class. Gieseker showed that there is a [[coarse moduli scheme]] for surfaces of general type; this means that for any fixed values of the Chern numbers ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a quasi-projective scheme classifying the surfaces of general type with those Chern numbers. However it is a very difficult problem to describe these schemes explicitly, and there are very few pairs of Chern numbers for which this has been done (except when the scheme is empty!)

'''Invariants:''' There are several conditions that the Chern numbers of a minimal complex surface of general type must satisfy:
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; 0, ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ 3''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the [[Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality]])
*5''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 36 ≥ 0 (the Noether inequality)
*''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is divisible by 12.

Most pairs of integers satisfying these conditions are the Chern numbers for some complex surface of general type.

'''Examples:''' The simplest examples are the product of two curves of genus at least 2, and a hypersurface of degree at least 5 in ''P''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. There are a large number of other constructions known. However, there is no
known construction that can  produce "typical" surfaces of general type for large Chern numbers; in fact it is not even known if there is any reasonable concept of a "typical" surface of general type. There are many other examples that have been found, including most [[Hilbert modular surface]]s, [[fake projective plane]]s, [[Barlow surface]]s, and so on.

An '''environmental organization''' is an [[organization]] coming out of the [[Conservation movement|conservation]] or [[environmental movement]]s
that seeks to protect, analyse or monitor the environment against misuse or [[environmental degradation|degradation]] [[Human impact on the environment|from human forces]].

In this sense the environment may refer to the [[environment (biophysical)|biophysical environment]], the [[natural environment]] or the [[built environment]]. The organization may be a [[Charitable organization|charity]], a [[trust law|trust]], a [[non-governmental organization]] or a government organization. Environmental organizations can be global, [[Country|national]], [[Subregion|regional]] or local.

== History ==
Founded on 28 May 1892 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[Sierra Club]] was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/about|title=About the Sierra Club|work=[[Sierra Club]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Most organizations exert more influence through their involvement in [[policy making]]. [[Green politics]] is a political ideology which emphasizes the importance of achieving environmental goals. The [[Green party|Green parties]] have formed to implement [[environmental policies]] at a government level.

== Issues in focus ==
[[File:Audubon Center at Bent of the River III.JPG|thumb|Audubon Center at Bent of the River. The Audubon Society is an environmental organization dedicated to the protection of birds.]]
Some [[environmental issue]]s that environmental organizations focus on include [[pollution]], [[waste]], [[resource depletion]], [[human overpopulation]] and [[climate change]].

{{Main article|List of environmental organizations}}
{{further information|List of anti-nuclear groups||Sustainability organizations|:Category:Environmental organizations}}

Notable global environmental organizations are the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), [[World Wide Fund for Nature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/project/|title=WWF conservation projects around the world|publisher=[[World Wide Fund for Nature]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), [[Greenpeace]] and [[Friends of the Earth]].

== Counter-movements ==
Many [[interest group]]s and associations have been formed, often industry supported, to counter the progressive - [[Criticism of capitalism|capitalism-]] and [[Criticism of libertarianism|economy-skeptic]] attitude and influence of environmental organizations. However, these interest groups are rarely pure in [[ideological]] nature.

The '''Euthanasia Coaster''' is an art concept for a [[steel roller coaster]] designed to kill its passengers.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/human-plus-science-gallery | title=The Future of the Human Species Explored | publisher=Condé Nast Publications | work=WIRED Science | date=6 April 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2011 | author=Solon, Olivia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, it was designed and made into a [[scale model]] by Julijonas Urbonas, a [[PhD candidate]] at the [[Royal College of Art]] in [[London]]. Urbonas, who has worked at an amusement park, stated that the goal of his concept roller coaster is to take lives "with elegance and euphoria".&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5793305/the-euthanasia-coaster-the-last-roller-coaster-youll-ever-ride | title=The Euthanasia Coaster, the Last Roller Coaster You'll Ever Ride | publisher=Gawker Media | date=18 April 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2011 | author=Lamar, Cyriaqe}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for practical applications of his design, Urbonas mentioned "[[euthanasia]]" or "[[execution]]".&lt;ref name="urbonas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://julijonasurbonas.lt/euthanasia-coaster/ | title=Euthanasia Coaster | date=2 October 2010 | accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Allen, who served as president of the [[Philadelphia Toboggan Company]], inspired Urbonas with his description of the "ultimate" roller coaster as one that "sends out 24 people and they all come back dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.designtaxi.com/news/34579/A-Rollercoaster-Designed-to-Kill-Humanely/?page=4 | title=A Rollercoaster Designed to Kill Humanely | publisher=Halls Create Arts Pte Ltd. | work= [[DesignTaxi]] | date=20 April 2011 | accessdate=23 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The concept design of the layout begins with a steep-angled [[lift hill|lift]] to the {{convert|510|m|ft|adj=on}} (0.317 mile) top, which would take two minutes for the 24-passenger [[train (roller coaster)|train]] to reach. Any passengers that wished to get off could then do so. &lt;ref name=wired/&gt; From there, a {{convert|500|m|ft|adj=on}} drop would take the train to {{convert|180|km/h|mi/h}}, close to its [[terminal velocity]], before flattening out and speeding into the first of its seven slightly [[clothoid]] [[Roller coaster inversions|inversions]].&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt; Each inversion would have a smaller [[diameter]] than the one before in order to maintain the lethal 10 [[g-force|g]] to passengers while the train loses speed. After a sharp right-hand turn the train would enter a straight, where unloading of corpses and loading of new passengers could take place.&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:Urbonas and Euthanasia Coaster.jpg|thumb|Julijonas Urbonas and Euthanasia Coaster at HUMAN+ display at the [[Science Gallery]] in [[Dublin]].]]
The Euthanasia Coaster would kill its passengers through prolonged [[cerebral hypoxia]], or insufficient supply of [[oxygen]] to the brain.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The ride's seven inversions would inflict 10 g on its passengers for 60 seconds – causing g-force related symptoms starting with [[greyout (medical)|gray out]] through [[tunnel vision]] to [[syncope (medicine)|black out]] and eventually [[g-LOC]] (g-force induced [[loss of consciousness]]).&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt; Subsequent inversions would serve as insurance against unintentional survival of particularly robust passengers.&lt;ref name=urbonas/&gt;

==Exhibition==
Urbonas's concept drew media attention when shown as part of the HUMAN+ display at the [[Science Gallery]] in [[Dublin]] from April through June 2011.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The display, designated as its 2011 '[[Flagship#Flagship as metaphor|flagship exhibition]]' by the Science Gallery,&lt;ref name="sciencegallery"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/humanplus/ | title=HUMAN+ The Future of Our Species | publisher=Trinity College Dublin | date=1 February 2011 | accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; aims to show the future of humans and technology.&lt;ref name="culturelab"&gt;{{cite web

==Popular culture==
In 2013, Norwegian rock group [[Major Parkinson]] released "Euthanasia Roller Coaster", a digital single with lyrics alluding to Urbonas's Euthanasia Coaster.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ba.no/puls/major-parkinson-er-tilbake/s/1-41-6773136 "Major Parkinson er tilbake"] Bergensavisen. Bergensavisen AS 23 July 2013. Retrieved 6 August 
2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lavie Tidhar]]'s short story ''Vladimir Chong Chooses to Die'' incorporates Urbonas's Euthanasia Coaster into the ending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfrevu.com/php/Review-id.php?id=15551] Analog Science Fiction and Fact –September 2014 – Vol. CXXXIV No. 9 &lt;/ref&gt;

Glenn Paton’s short film ''H Positive'' explores the motivations of a wealthy man who, upon discovering that he is dying, commissions an architect to build a Euthanasia Coaster identical to Urbonas's design.  Although Urbonas is not mentioned during the film, the end credits affirm that the film was based on Urbonas's project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nerdist.com/dark-short-film-shows-off-theoretical-suicide-roller-coaster/|title=Dark Short Film Shows Off Theoretical Suicide Roller Coaster|publisher=[[Nerdist Industries]]|last=Hart|first=Matthew|date=5 April 2016|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27332">In [[psychology]], the '''false-consensus effect''' or '''false-consensus bias''' is an [[Attribution bias|attributional]] type of [[cognitive bias]] whereby people tend to overestimate the extent to which their opinions, beliefs, preferences, values, and habits are normal and typical of those of others (i.e., that others also think the same way that they do).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologycampus.com/social-psychology/false-consensus.html |title=False Consensus &amp; False Uniqueness |publisher=Psychology Campus.com |accessdate=2007-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117094105/http://www.psychologycampus.com/social-psychology/false-consensus.html |archivedate=2007-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cognitive bias tends to lead to the [[perception]] of a consensus that does not exist, a "false consensus".

This false consensus is significant because it increases [[self-esteem]] ([[overconfidence effect]]). It can be derived from a desire to conform and be liked by others in a social environment. This bias is especially prevalent in group settings where one thinks the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population. Since the members of a group reach a consensus and rarely encounter those who dispute it, they tend to believe that everybody thinks the same way. The false-consensus effect is not restricted to cases where people believe that their values are shared by the majority, but it still manifests as an overestimate of the extent of their belief.&lt;!-- Source? --&gt;

Additionally, when confronted with evidence that a consensus does not exist, people often assume that those who do not agree with them are defective in some way.&lt;ref name=psyblog&gt;{{cite web |last1= Dean|first=Jeremy|date=2007|url= http://www.spring.org.uk/2007/11/why-we-all-stink-as-intuitive.php |title=Why We All Stink as Intuitive Psychologists: The False Consensus Bias |publisher=PsyBlog |accessdate=2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no single cause for this cognitive bias; the [[availability heuristic]], [[self-serving bias]], and [[naïve realism (psychology)|naïve realism]] have been suggested as at least partial underlying factors. Maintenance of this cognitive bias may be related to the tendency to make decisions with relatively little information. When faced with uncertainty and a limited sample from which to make decisions, people often "project" themselves onto the situation. When this personal knowledge is used as input to make generalizations, it often results in the false sense of being part of the majority.{{sfn|Myers|2015|p=38}}{{clarify|reason=My own introspective generalizations almost always lead to the opposite conclusion—that my own view is eccentric and unique; why should we here assume that for most people this goes the other direction?|date=December 2016}}

The false-consensus effect can be contrasted with [[pluralistic ignorance]], an error in which people privately disapprove but publicly support what seems to be the majority view (see below).

==Contrasted with pluralistic ignorance==
The false-consensus effect can be contrasted with [[pluralistic ignorance]], an error in which people privately disapprove but publicly support what seems to be the majority view (regarding a norm or belief), when the majority in fact shares their (private) disapproval. While the false-consensus effect leads people to wrongly believe that the majority agrees with them (when the majority, in fact, openly disagrees with them), the pluralistic ignorance effect leads people to wrongly believe that they disagree with the majority (when the majority, in fact, covertly agrees with them). Pluralistic ignorance might, for example, lead a student to engage in binge drinking because of the mistaken belief that most other students approve of it, while in reality most other students disapprove, but behave in the same way because they share the same mistaken (but collectively self-sustaining) belief. In a parallel example of the false-consensus effect, a student who likes binge drinking would believe that a majority also likes it, while in reality most others dislike it and openly say so.

==Major theoretical approaches==
The false-consensus effect can be traced back to two parallel theories of [[social perception]], "the study of how we form impressions of and make inferences about other people".{{sfn|Aronson|Wilson|Akert|Sommers|2015|p=86}} The first is the idea of social comparison. The principal claim of [[Leon Festinger]]'s (1954) [[social comparison theory]] was that individuals evaluate their thoughts and attitudes based on other people.{{sfn|Bauman|Geher|2002|p=294}} This may be motivated by a desire for confirmation and the need to feel good about oneself. As an extension of this theory, people may use others as sources of information to define social reality and guide behavior. This is called informational social influence.{{sfn|Aronson|Wilson|Akert|Sommers|2015|p=231}}{{sfn|Bauman|Geher|2002|p=293}} The problem, though, is that people are often unable to accurately perceive the social norm and the actual attitudes of others. In other words, research has shown that people are surprisingly poor "intuitive psychologists" and that our social judgments are often inaccurate.{{sfn|Bauman|Geher|2002|p=294}} This finding helped to lay the groundwork for an understanding of biased processing and inaccurate social perception. The false-consensus effect is just one example of such an inaccuracy.{{sfn|Bauman|Geher|2002|p=293}}

The second influential theory is [[projection (psychology)|projection]], the idea that people project their own attitudes and beliefs onto others. This idea of projection is not a new concept. In fact, it can be found in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s work on the [[defense mechanism]] of projection, D.S. Holmes' work on "attributive projection" (1968), and Gustav Ichheisser's work on social perception (1970).{{sfn|Gilovich|1990}} D.S. Holmes, for example, described social projection as the process by which people "attempt to validate their beliefs by projecting their own characteristics onto other individuals".{{sfn|Bauman|Geher|2002|p=294}}

Here a connection can be made between the two stated theories of social comparison and projection. First, as social comparison theory explains, individuals constantly look to peers as a reference group and are motivated to do so in order to seek confirmation for their own attitudes and beliefs.{{sfn|Bauman|Geher|2002|p=294}} In order to guarantee confirmation and a higher self-esteem, though, an individual might unconsciously project their own beliefs onto the others (the targets of their comparisons). This final outcome is the false-consensus effect. To summarize, the false-consensus effect can be seen as stemming from both social comparison theory and the concept of projection.

The false-consensus effect, as defined by [[Lee Ross|Ross]], Greene, and House in 1977, came to be the culmination of the many related theories that preceded it. In their well-known series of four studies, Ross and associates hypothesized and then demonstrated that people tend to overestimate the popularity of their own beliefs and preferences.{{sfn|Ross|Greene|House|1977}} In each of the studies, subjects or "raters" were asked to choose one of a few mutually-exclusive responses. They would then predict the popularity of each of their choices among other participants, referred to as "actors". To take this a step further, Ross and associates also proposed and tested a related bias in social inferences: they found that raters in an experiment estimated their own response to be not only common, but also not very revealing of the actors' "distinguishing personal dispositions".{{sfn|Ross|Greene|House|1977}} On the other hand, alternative or opposite responses were perceived as much more revealing of the actors as people. In general, the raters made more "extreme predictions" about the personalities of the actors that did not share the raters' own preference. In fact, the raters may have even thought that there was something wrong with the people expressing the alternative response.&lt;ref name=psyblog /&gt;

In the ten years after the influential Ross et al. study, close to 50 papers were published with data on the false-consensus effect.{{sfn|Marks|Miller|1987|p=72}} Theoretical approaches were also expanded. The theoretical perspectives of this era can be divided into four categories: (a) selective exposure and cognitive availability, (b) salience and focus of attention, (c) logical information processing, and (d) motivational processes.{{sfn|Marks|Miller|1987|p=72}} In general, the researchers and designers of these theories believe that there is not a single right answer. Instead, they admit that there is overlap among the theories and that the false-consensus effect is most likely due to a combination of these factors.{{sfn|Marks|Miller|1987}}

===Selective exposure and cognitive availability===
This theory is closely tied to the availability heuristic, which suggests that perceptions of similarity (or difference) are affected by how easily those characteristics can be recalled from memory.{{sfn|Marks|Miller|1987|p=72}} And as one might expect, similarities between oneself and others are more easily recalled than differences. This is in part because people usually associate with those who are similar to themselves. This selected exposure to similar people may bias or restrict the "sample of information about the true diversity of opinion in the larger social environment".{{sfn|Marks|Miller|1987|p=73}} As a result of the selective exposure and availability heuristic, it is natural for the similarities to prevail in one's thoughts.{{sfn|Marks|Miller|1987}}

{{harvtxt|Botvin et al.|1992}} did a popular study on the effects of the false-consensus effect among a specific adolescent community in an effort to determine whether students show a higher level of false-consensus effect among their direct peers as opposed to society at large.{{sfn|Bauman|Geher|2002}} The participants of this experiment were 203 college students ranging in age from 18 to 25 (with an average age of 18.5). The participants were given a questionnaire and asked to answer questions regarding a variety of social topics. For each social topic, they were asked to answer how they felt about the topic and to estimate the percentage of their peers who would agree with them. The results determined that the false-consensus effect was extremely prevalent when participants were describing the rest of their college community; out of twenty topics considered, sixteen of them prominently demonstrated the false-consensus effect. The high levels of false-consensus effect seen in this study can be attributed to the group studied; because the participants were asked to compare themselves to a group of peers that they are constantly around (and view as very similar to themselves), the levels of false-consensus effect increased.{{sfn|Bauman|Geher|2002}}

===Salience and focus of attention===
This theory suggests that when an individual focuses solely on their own preferred position, they are more likely to overestimate its popularity, thus falling victim to the false-consensus effect.{{sfn|Marks|Miller|1987|p=73}} This is because that position is the only one in their immediate consciousness. Performing an action that promotes the position will make it more salient and may increase the false-consensus effect. If, however, more positions are presented to the individual, the degree of the false-consensus effect might decrease significantly.{{sfn|Marks|Miller|1987|p=73}}

===Logical information processing===
This theory assumes that active and seemingly rational thinking underlies an individual's estimates of similarity among others.{{sfn|Marks|Miller|1987|p=73}} This is manifested in one's causal attributions. For instance, if an individual makes an external attribution for their belief, the individual will likely view his or her experience of the thing in question as merely a matter of objective experience. For example, a few movie-goers may falsely assume that the quality of the film is a purely objective entity. To explain their dissatisfaction with it, the viewers may say that it was simply a bad movie (an external attribution). Based on this (perhaps erroneous) assumption of objectivity, it seems rational or "logical" to assume that everyone else will have the same experience; consensus should be high. On the other hand, someone in the same situation who makes an internal attribution (perhaps a film aficionado who is well-aware of his or her especially high standards) will realize the subjectivity of the experience and will be drawn to the opposite conclusion; their estimation of consensus with their experience will be much lower. Although they result in two opposite outcomes, both paths of attribution rely on an initial assumption which then leads to a "logical" conclusion. By this logic, then, it can be said that the false-consensus effect is really a reflection of the [[fundamental attribution error]] (specifically the actor-observer bias), in which people prefer external/situational attributions over internal/dispositional ones to justify their own behaviors.

In a study done by Fox, Yinon, and Mayraz, researchers were attempting to determine whether or not the levels of the false-consensus effect changed in different age groups. In order to come to a conclusion, it was necessary for the researchers to split their participants into four different age groups. Two hundred participants were used, and gender was not considered to be a factor. Just as in the previous study mentioned, this study used a questionnaire as its main source of information. The results showed that the false-consensus effect was extremely prevalent in all groups, but was the most prevalent in the oldest age group (the participants who were labeled as "old-age home residents"). They showed the false-consensus effect in all 12 areas that they were questioned about. The increase in false-consensus effect seen in the oldest age group can be accredited to their high level of "logical" reasoning behind their decisions; the oldest age group has obviously lived the longest, and therefore feels that they can project their beliefs onto all age groups due to their (seemingly objective) past experiences and wisdom. The younger age groups cannot logically relate to those older to them because they have not had that experience and do not pretend to know these objective truths. These results demonstrate a tendency for older people to rely more heavily on situational attributions (life experience) as opposed to internal attributions.{{sfn|Yinon|Mayraz|Fox|1994}}

===Motivational processes===
This theory stresses the benefits of the false-consensus effect: namely, the perception of increased social validation, social support, and self-esteem. It may also be useful to exaggerate similarities in social situations in order to increase liking.{{sfn|Marks|Miller|1987|p=74}} It is possible that these benefits serve as [[positive reinforcement]] for false-consensus thinking.

==Relation to personality psychology==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}
Within the realm of [[personality psychology]], the false-consensus effect does not have significant effects. This is because the false-consensus effect relies heavily on the social environment and how a person interprets this environment. Instead of looking at situational attributions, personality psychology evaluates a person with dispositional attributions, making the false-consensus effect relatively irrelevant in that domain. Therefore, a person's personality potentially could affect the ''degree'' to which the person relies on false-consensus effect, but not the ''existence'' of such a trait. This should not, however, be interpreted as an individual being the sole product of the social environment. In order for the trait to "exist" in an organism's mind, there must be a biological structure that underpins it. For an organism to visibly see ultraviolet light, they must have genes (which then give rise to the biological structure) that allows them to see the external environment. Since the brain is a biological system, there must be an underlying biological disposition that similarly allows an individual to register and interpret the social environment, thus generating the false-consensus effect. The brain's purpose is, after all, to extract information from the environment and accordingly generate behaviour and regulate physiology. There is no distinction between "innate" or "learned", or "nature" versus "nurture" as the interaction of both are needed; it does not sit along a dimension nor is it to be distinguished from each other. Social and personality psychology are not separate fields, but necessarily complementary fields, as demonstrated by the [[person-situation debate]].

==Belief in a favorable future==
The concept of false consensus effect can also be extended to predictions about future others. [[Belief in a favorable future]] is the belief that future others will change their preferences and beliefs in alignment with one's own.{{sfn|Rogers|Moore|Norton|2017}} Belief in a favorable future suggests that people overestimate the extent to which other people will come to agree with their preferences and beliefs over time.

Rogers, Moore, and Norton (2017){{sfn|Rogers|Moore|Norton|2017}} find that belief in a favorable future is greater in magnitude than the false-consensus effect for two reasons: 
# It is based in future others whose beliefs are not directly observable, and
# It is focused on future beliefs, which gives these future others time to “discover” the truth and change their beliefs.

==Applications==
{{Essay|section|date=September 2011}}
{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}
The false-consensus effect is an important attribution bias to take into consideration when conducting business and in everyday social interactions. Essentially, people are inclined to believe that the general population agrees with their opinions and judgments. Whether this belief is accurate, it gives them a feeling of more assurance and security in their decisions. This could be an important phenomenon to either exploit or avoid in business dealings.

For example, if a man doubted whether he wanted to buy a new tool, breaking down his notion that others agree with his doubt would be an important step in persuading him to purchase it. By convincing the customer that other people in fact do want to buy the appliance, the seller could perhaps make a sale that he would not have made otherwise. In this way, the false-consensus effect is closely related to [[conformity]], the effect in which an individual is influenced to match the beliefs or behaviors of a group. There are two differences between the false-consensus effect and conformity: most importantly, conformity is matching the behaviors, beliefs, or attitudes of a real group, while the false-consensus effect is perceiving that others share your behaviors, beliefs, or attitudes, whether or not they really do. Making the customer feel like the opinion of others (society) is to buy the appliance will make the customer feel more confident about his purchase and will make him believe that other people would have made the same decision.
&lt;!-- What is the other difference? It says there are two, then says the "most important" one, and never explains the other.
1 Difference?:
1)conformity is matching the behaviors, beliefs, or attitudes of a real group
2)false-consensus effect is perceiving that others share your behaviors, beliefs, or attitudes, whether or not they really do

Looks like they touch on it more deeply in next paragraph. But If they did it in the form of an example I imagine that it would read something like this:
If say instead of valuing other individuals' apparent opinion over their own (and thus conforming or participating in a false consensus) the man had decided to to evaluate the price point and value of of his intended purchase themselves and thus form an independent logical stance on the issue (unaffected by the apparent societal stance) they would have truly contributed to consensus. Particularly after entering into public discussion about their stance and observing and citing publicly available evidence to support their position.  --&gt;

Similarly, any elements of society affected by public opinion—e.g., elections, advertising, publicity—are very much influenced by the false-consensus effect. This is partially because the way in which people develop their perceptions involves "differential processes of awareness".{{sfn|Nir|2011}} That is to say, while some people are motivated to reach correct conclusions, others may be motivated to reach preferred conclusions. Members of the latter category will more often experience the false-consensus effect, because the subject is likely to search actively for like-minded supporters and may discount or ignore the opposition.

==Uncertainties==
There is ambiguity about several facets of the false-consensus effect and of its study. First of all, it is unclear exactly which factors play the largest role in the strength and prevalence of the false-consensus effect in individuals. For example, two individuals in the same group and with very similar social standing could have very different levels of false-consensus effect, but it is unclear what social, personality, or perceptual differences between them play the largest role in causing this disparity.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Additionally, it can be difficult to obtain accurate survey data about the false-consensus effect (as well as other psychological biases) because the search for consistent, reliable groups to be surveyed (often over an extended period of time) often leads to groups that might have dynamics slightly different from those of the "real world". For example, many of the referenced studies in this article examined college students, who might have an especially high level of false-consensus effect both because they are surrounded by their peers (and perhaps experience the availability heuristic) and because they often assume that they are similar to their peers. This may result in distorted data from some studies of the false-consensus effect.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43147">'''Fear appeal''' is a term used in [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[marketing]]. It generally describes a strategy for motivating people to take a particular action, endorse a particular policy, or buy a particular product, by arousing fear. A well-known example in television advertising was a commercial employing the musical jingle: "Never pick up a stranger, pick up Prestone anti-freeze." This was accompanied by images of shadowy strangers (hitchhikers) who would presumably do one harm if picked up. The commercial's main appeal was not to the positive features of Prestone anti-freeze, but to the fear of what a "strange" brand might do.

A fear appeal is a persuasive [[message]] that attempts to arouse fear in order to divert behavior through the threat of impending danger or harm.&lt;ref name=Maddux&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maddux | first1 = J. E. | last2 = Rogers | first2 = R.

It is assumed that through a fear appeal the perception of threatening stimuli creates [[fear|fear arousal]]. The state of fear is believed to be an unpleasant emotional state that involves [[physiology|physiological]] arousal that motivates [[cognition|cognitive]], [[affect (psychology)|affective]], and behavioral responses directed towards alleviating the threat or reducing fear.&lt;ref name=Ruiter&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ruiter | first1 = R.

They include: the [[extended parallel process model]], the [[drive theory]], the [[subjective expected utility|subjective expected utility theory]], the protection motivation theory, the [[health belief model]], the [[theory of reasoned action]], and the [[transtheoretical model]]. These models are widely used in substance abuse campaigns, sexual health programs, and many other general health contexts. The persuasive effect of fear appeals is thought to be influenced by several factors such as individual characteristics, [[self-efficacy]], perception of norms, fear strength, perceived threat, perception of treatment efficacy, and defense mechanisms. Mixed results have been produced from studies that attempt to demonstrate the effectiveness of fear appeals for behavior modification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Walkters | first1 = S | year = 2000 | title = Drinking on campus: What do we know about reducing alcohol use among college students? | url = | journal = Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 223–228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recent meta-analysis recommended extreme caution in the use of fear appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, G.

==Models==
Over the last half century, a substantial amount of research has been done on the influence of fear on persuasion. A multitude of theories and models of fear appeals, also known as cognitive mediating processes, have been derived from this research. The goal of each of these has been to conceptualize the influence of fear on persuasion so as to better understand how to employ it in addressing the public on a number of social issues.

===Extended parallel process model===
The [[extended parallel process model]] (EPPM) is a theory that explains how cognitive and emotional mechanisms trigger distinct motivational and coping responses such as fear control and danger control responses. Fear control responses minimize fear through emotional coping that generates reassurance through denial of the threat or derogation of the persuasive message. Fear control is a process of denial that does not involve physically averting behavior to the perceived threat. Danger control is a cognitive process also oriented towards reducing the presented threat. However, unlike fear control response, danger control response may prompt protective action. Thus according to the extended parallel process model, the experience of fear is considered an emotional reaction, and the perceptions of threat are a set of cognitions. 
The extended parallel process model differs from many other fear appeal arguments because it suggests that fear arousal and danger control processes are distinct processes where fear arousal need not precede the danger control process that underpin precautionary behaviors.&lt;ref name=Ruiter/&gt;

It is predicted that a fear appeal will initiate a dominant response of either fear control or danger control processes. 
The extended parallel process model concludes that cognitions (attitudes, intentions, and behavior changes) result in fear appeal success via the danger control process. It also concludes that fear appeals fail when the fear emotion is reduced via the fear control process.

Defensive avoidance is an example of a fear control response that leads to the failure of fear appeals.&lt;ref name=Witte&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Witte | first1 = K. | last2 = Allen | first2 = M. | year = 2000 | title = A meta-analysis of fear appeals: Implications for effective public health campaigns | url = | journal = Health Education &amp; Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = 5| pages = 591–615 | doi=10.1177/109019810002700506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drive theory===
Emotional tension is a key characteristic of drive theory.  According to the theory, a threat that portrays the negative consequences of non-compliance to a recommended behavior is expected to create fear. In order to relieve the emotional tension of the threat, the "drive" state motivates behavior conduct that reduces the tension. According to the drive theory, it is expected that the greater the fear, the greater the compliance to message recommendations.

Research has not produced consistent empirical results supporting the drive reduction model. For example, a dental hygiene presentation to a group of high school students reported greater change in attitudes using mild rather than strong fear appeals. When repeated, the reverse effect was true: greater attitude and behavior change occurred when a strong fear appeal was used, versus a moderate or weak fear appeal.&lt;ref name=Cho&gt;Cho, H. (1999). Unintended effects of fear appeals: The role of stage of change, threat, and efficacy. Michigan State University). ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, 146-146 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subjective expected utility theory===
The [[subjective expected utility|subjective expected utility theory]] has been applied to contexts beyond fear appeals. In the context of a fear appeal, the subjective expected utility theory predicts that a fear appeal is successful when the individual believes that the benefits in risk reduction outweigh the expected cost of acting. 
To assess the efficacy of a fear appeal respondents would be asked about the likelihood and severity of harmful outcomes of risk involved. The proposed severity is considered under the conditions of the current behavior and then under the alternative behavior. The efficacy is perceived through the effectiveness of the respondents answer. The subjective expected utility theory is unlike other theories of fear appeal because it does not describe the emotional process involved in fear reduction. It is only used to predict the relative likelihood of action. As previously stated, the subjective expected utility theory can be applied to various contexts such as predicting retirement and child-bearing.&lt;ref name=Weinstein&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = N. D. | year = 1993 | title = Testing four competing theories of health-protective behavior | url = | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 324–333 | doi=10.1037/0278-6133.12.4.324}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protection motivation theory===
The protection motivation theory is an attitude-based model. It holds that a fear appeal argument initiates a cognitive assessment process that considers the severity of the threatened event, the probability of the occurrence of the event, and the efficacy of a recommended behavior response. According to the theory, the cognitive assessment processes enhance a fear appeal when it provokes protection motivation. Protection motivation is a variable that arouses, sustains, and directs the suggested behavior to avoid danger.&lt;ref name=Maddux/&gt; In absence of protection motivation, the recommended protective action is judged to be ineffective in averting the threat or impossible to undertake then no intention to act will result.&lt;ref name=Ruiter/&gt; The protection motivation theory predicts that preventative actions will be preferred in a high threat situation when the self-efficacy and the efficacy of the recommended action are both high. Conversely, it is expected that maladaptive actions will be maintained when there is a high threat but the efficacy perceptions are low.

The protection motivation theory has been applied to analyzing the efficacy of health campaigns such as those encouraging self-breast examinations for detecting breast cancer. Studies found that perceptions of threat concerning breast cancer prompted adaptive actions, such as performing self-examinations, and maladaptive actions, such as to avoid thinking about breast cancer.

===Health belief model===
The [[health belief model]] predicts that perceived susceptibility and severity of a risk motivates individuals to engage in preventive actions, and the type of preventative action depends on the perceived benefits and hindrances of performing the action.&lt;ref name=Cho/&gt;

A fear argument based on the health belief model is typically presented in terms of the likelihood and severity of health consequences if the current behavior is not changed. With the health belief model, it is unclear whether self-efficacy is directly considered a cost of performing a suggested action because occasionally, a fear appeal is thought to be less effective if a difficulty of acting is considered a cost of acting.&lt;ref name=Weinstein/&gt;

===Theory of reasoned action===
According to the [[theory of reasoned action]], acting on fear appeals begins by consideration of a wider range of consequences of continuing the current behavior beyond the threat of health risks. It also considers a wider range of consequences of the suggested behavior beyond the costs and reduced health risks. The projected consequences vary depending on the situation. The theory of reasoned action differs from other theories because it also incorporates a social influence factor in predicting the efficacy of fear appeals. The social influence is determined by normative beliefs and the desires of other relevant people to perform the given behavior.&lt;ref name=Weinstein/&gt;

The theory of reasoned action has been applied to alcohol, tobacco, and other drug campaigns. For example, it has helped identify the importance of peer pressure and the normative belief of parents as variables for improving school-based drug campaigns. Although the theory of reasoned action has been shown to be a strong predictive utility of social behavior, it is considered to be deficient in explaining behavior change.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharma | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = Theory of reasoned action &amp; theory of planned behavior in alcohol and drug education | url = | journal = Journal of Alcohol and Drug Education | volume = 51 | issue = 1| pages = 3–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transtheoretical model===
A [[transtheoretical model]] of fear appeals explains a dynamic process of health behavior change. Its structure is based on the assumption that behavior change is a systematic process involving a series of stages referred to as stages of change. It also holds that the transition between stages involves a rational coping process referred to as processes of change. The stages of change are: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.&lt;ref name=Velasquez&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Velasquez | first1 = M. M. | last2 = Carbonari | first2 = J. P. | last3 = DiClemente | first3 = C. C. | year = 1999 | title = Psychiatric severity and behavior change in alcoholism: The relation of the transtheoretical model variables to psychiatric distress in dually diagnosed patients | url = | journal = Addictive Behaviors | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 481–496 | doi = 10.1016/S0306-4603(98)00103-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the transtheoretical model, movement through the different stages involves a process called decision balance. Decision balance takes into account the potential gains and costs resulting from the new behavior. It is believed that an individual will not change or continue a behavior unless they perceive advantages to outweigh the disadvantages.&lt;ref name=Velasquez/&gt;

====Pre-contemplation====
The pre-contemplation stage is a period in which individuals have no intentions to stop a risky behavior or start a healthy behavior. This may be due to a lack in knowledge of the risk involving their current behavior, or an unwillingness to acknowledge that their behavior puts them at risk. The process of change from the pre-contemplation phase to the contemplation phase includes the response of conscious raising, dramatic relief, and an environmental reevaluation process to the argument.&lt;ref name=Cho/&gt;

====Contemplation====
The second stage is contemplation. It is the stage at which an individual is actively considering stopping risky behavior or starting a healthy behavior. It is predicted that individuals will remain at this stage for a long period of time due to the difficulty in evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of behavior change.&lt;ref name=Velasquez/&gt;
The process of change to the following stage is expedited by self-reevaluation.&lt;ref name=Cho/&gt;

====Preparation====
This is the third stage at which individuals have been persuaded and commit to change their behavior.&lt;ref name=Velasquez/&gt;
The process of change to the action stage involves a self-liberation process in which the fear appeal influences a changed behavior.&lt;ref name=Cho/&gt;

====Action====
Action is the stage at which the individual engages in behavior change. They have tried to stop their risky behavior. The process of change that helps facilitate progression includes behavioral processes, such as reinforcement management, helping relationships, counterconditioning, and stimulus control.

====Maintenance====
Maintenance is the final stage for changing risky behavior. This is the stage at which individuals adopt healthy behavior into their lifestyle, and try to prevent regression into the risk behavior.&lt;ref name=Velasquez/&gt;
Regression is possible at any point of the stages. 
 
The transtheoretical model has been used to structure various programs for smoking cessation, alcohol abstinence, sunscreen use, dietary change, and contraceptive use.&lt;ref name=Velasquez/&gt;

==Factors that affect its efficacy==
"The ultimate goal of fear appeals is to effectively promote reflective message processing and to influence individual affect towards the message".&lt;ref name=de_Hoog/&gt; Individual perceptual differences towards the fear appeal are factors that govern the efficacy of the fear appeal. Researchers have examined several variables that have been thought, at one time or another, to influence the persuasive effect of fear appeals. These factors include: individual characteristics, risk perception, perception of self-efficacy, perception of treatment efficacy, perception of norms, the strength of the fear elicited, perceived threat, and defense mechanisms. The results of the research have demonstrated that various, and sometimes multiple factors, affect the efficacy of fear appeals depending on the method used and the individual.

===Individual characteristics===
Also of interest in the fear appeals literature has been the contribution of individual characteristics.&lt;ref name=Brouwers&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brouwers | first1 = M. C. | last2 = Sorrentino | first2 = R. M. | year = 1993 | title = Uncertainty orientation and protection motivation theory: The role of individual differences in health compliance | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 102–112 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.65.1.102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal has been to understand which individual differences in personality or psychological traits contribute or detract from the effectiveness of the fear appeal. Individual moderating variables studied thus far include trait anxiety,&lt;ref name=Witte/&gt; age, ethnicity, gender, coping style,&lt;ref name=Rogers&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = R. W. | last2 = Mewborn | first2 = C. R. | year = 1976 | title = Fear appeals and attitude change: Effects of a threat's noxiousness, probability of occurrence, and the efficacy of coping responses | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 54–61 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.34.1.54}}&lt;/ref&gt; locus of control,&lt;ref name="Burnett"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burnett | first1 = J. J. | year = 1981 | title = Internal–external locus of control as a moderator of fear appeals | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 390–393 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.66.3.390}}&lt;/ref&gt; self-esteem, perceived vulnerability, need for cognition and uncertainty orientation.&lt;ref name=Brouwers/&gt; Of these, uncertainty orientation and need for cognition have been found to interact with the level of threat. Uncertainty orientation is an individual's characteristic response to uncertainty. That is, whether one attends to or avoids and ignores the source of the uncertainty. Those with an uncertainty orientation tend to be more motivated to deeply process the information presented as the personal relevance increases, whereas those with a certainty orientation will actively avoid it.&lt;ref name=Brouwers/&gt; Some early studies examined other characteristics, such as individual thresholds for fear arousal, to see if they moderated the effect of fear on persuasion. A study by Janis and Feshbach (1954)&lt;ref name=Janis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janis | first1 = I. L. | last2 = Feshbach | first2 = S. | year = 1954 | title = Personality differences associated with responsiveness to fear-arousing communications | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 154–166 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1954.tb01145.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; found that those with lower fear arousal thresholds were the least compelled to act by the high fear appeals, as they tended to react with defensive control responses. Lower threshold subjects were also more easily persuaded by counterarguments following the fear appeal. Trait anxiety has also been the subject of some of the early research, which has since been found to have no discernible effect on persuasion.&lt;ref name=Witte/&gt;

===Perception of self-efficacy===
The [[self-efficacy]] theory states that all processes of psychological change alter the level and strength of self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Bandura&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bandura | first1 = A | year = 1977 | title = Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 84 | issue = 2| pages = 191–215 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.2.191 | pmid=847061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-efficacy is enhanced by performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Self-efficacy can also be enhanced by the perceived dependability of the source. The level of self-efficacy an individual has is believed to influence their choice of behavior as well as the amount of time, and the amount of effort expended on that behavior. If the individual does not believe that he or she is capable of averting the threat, it is likely that denial or other defensive responses will be produced in order to lower the fear. The fear of threatening situations may have an adverse effect on the efficacy of a fear appeal. An intimidating situation may cause an individual to believe that he/she is incapable of performing the suggested preventative behaviors that will lead to avoidance behaviors. Bandura's
&lt;ref name=Bandura/&gt; research has demonstrated a positive correlation between changes in behavior and changes in self-efficacy expectance. He found that behavioral transformations are caused by changes in self-efficacy.

Research done by others have revealed "a positive, linear effect of fear on overall intentions and behavior", especially when the messages endorse people's self-efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;Tannenbaum{{who|date=June 2015}} et al., 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is more positive when behaviors are performed on one-time basis instead of repeatedly. However, other researchers also pointed out that in the context of self-efficacy need to be considered carefully in relation to other stratefies. The use of other persuative techniques such as behavioral trainings might counteract against the efficacy of fear appeal in isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Earl | first1 = A. | last2 = Albarracin | first2 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Nature, decay, and spiraling of the effects of fear-inducing arguments and HIV-counseling and testing: A meta-analysis of the short- and long-term outcomes of HIV-prevention interventions | url = | journal = Health Psychology | volume = 26 | issue = | pages = 496–506 | doi=10.1037/0278-6133.26.4.496| pmc = 2703734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance accomplishments====
According to the theory of self-efficacy, performance accomplishments are related to the success of personal experience. When strong efficacy expectations are established, then the impact of occasional failures are reduced. If self-efficacy is established, it tends to generalize to other situations. 
Vicarious experience is the observation of others who have performed threatening activities. If others are observed to successfully perform threatening activities, then self-efficacy is expected to increase because the social comparison will reinforce the perception that the behavior can be achieved through effort.
&lt;ref name=Velasquez/&gt;

====Verbal persuasion====
Verbal persuasion is widely used because of the potentially persuasive influence of suggestion. The influence of suggestion is expected to boost individual self-efficacy. Research has shown that the effects of verbal persuasion may not prevail through a long history of failure. It has been shown to create an enduring sense of self-efficacy in situations where aid is given to facilitate successful action. Failures have a negative effect because it discredits the persuaders and undermines the individual's self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Velasquez/&gt;

====Emotional arousal====
Depending on the circumstances, stressful situations can lessen the feeling of personal competency. Poor performance, for example is usually associated with a state of high arousal. Fear-provoking thoughts can cause an individual to overestimate the intensity of a threatening situation. According to the self-efficacy theory, diminishing emotional arousal can reduce avoidance behavior. Physiological arousal has been predicted to have both positive and negative effects on beneficial or negative coping behaviors. A positive perception of an aroused state may energize, while a negative perception of an aroused state may inhibit coping behaviors.&lt;ref name=Velasquez/&gt;

====Physiological arousal====
Physiological arousal has been predicted to have both positive and negative effects on beneficial or negative coping behaviors. A positive perception of an aroused state may energize, while a negative perception of an aroused state may inhibit coping behaviors.&lt;ref name=Velasquez/&gt;

===Perception of treatment efficacy===
Perceived treatment efficacy is also referred to as response-outcome expectancies. It is conceptualized as a person's estimate that a given behavior will lead to certain outcomes. Perception of treatment efficacy differs from self-efficacy because an individual's belief in their ability to perform the suggested actions does not influence their behavior it is the perceived outcome that determines an individual's actions. The enactment of sustained long-term behaviors intended by the fear appeal communication is strongly influenced by the individual perception of treatment efficacy. The extent to which an individual perceives the protection of the recommended action against the health risk determines whether they are persuaded to perform the recommended course of action. A positive perception of treatment efficacy is internalized by the emphasis of the positive aspects of the recommended action.&lt;ref name=de_Hoog/&gt; Perceived treatment efficacy is possibly the most integral element of an effectively persuasive fear appeal, and more predictive of action than fear arousal, is perceived efficacy. Some research has found that perceived efficacy is more predictive of intention to change behavior than other elements of perceived threat.&lt;ref name=Ruiter/&gt;

===Perception of norms===
Even if a health behavior is portrayed as harmful, the behavior may not be altered by fear inducing communication if the individual is convinced that the behavior is common practice. The behavior is unlikely to be changed if the individual's social group models or reinforces the actions. In this case, there may also be a false perception of norms. Reinforcement of the negative health behavior by the common social group decreases the effectiveness of the fear appeal.&lt;ref name=Perkins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perkins | first1 = H. W. | last2 = Wechsler | first2 = H. | year = 1996 | title = Variation in perceived college drinking norms and its impact on alcohol abuse: A nationwide study | url = | journal = Journal of Drug Issues | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 961–974 | doi=10.1177/002204269602600413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: In a study of alcohol abuse on college campuses, students demonstrated heavy alcohol use in response to their peer groups that reinforced the behavior. Students who abused alcohol also believed that their peers were even heavier users than they actually were. Those who believed that heavy intoxication was an element of campus culture may be at a greater risk for personal alcohol abuse due to the desire to conform to the perceived norm.&lt;ref name=Perkins/&gt;

===Fear strength===
The strength of the fear elicited by the message is also an important determinant of the subject's intentions to change the target behavior.  Fear strength is distinct from threat severity in that, as mentioned before, fear strength is related to the emotion of fear, whereas threat severity is considered to be an entirely cognitive process. Some early research found that higher levels of fear produced defensive reactions, compelling the researchers to caution that low or moderate levels were the most effective.&lt;ref name=Janis/&gt;  With rare exception, strength of the fear elicited has been consistently found to be positively correlated with behavior change.&lt;ref name="Keller 1999 403–415"/&gt; This positive linear correlation is ubiquitous in fear appeal research and has laid to rest the curvilinear relationship implied by some of the earliest research. Strength of fear has been found to be positively correlated, as expected, with arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scharz|first1=N.|last2=Servay|first2=W.|last3=Kumpf|first3=M.|title=Attribution of Arousal as a Mediator of the Effectiveness of Fear-Arousing Communications|journal=The Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1985|volume=15|issue=2|pages=178–188|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.1985.tb02343.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Early research has found that low fear appeal strength was the most persuasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Irving|first1=J.L.|last2=Feschback|first2=S.|title=Personality Differences Associated with Responsiveness to Fear-Arousing Communications|journal=Journal of Personality|year=1954|volume=23|issue=2|pages=154–166|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1954.tb01145.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strength of fear alone is not enough to motivate change in behavior as strong fear with no recommended action, or a recommended action that is not easily performed, may result in the exact opposite effect. According to Sternthal and Craig,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sternthal|first1=B.|last2=Craig|first2=C.S.|title=Fear Appeals: Revisited and Revised|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|year=1974|volume=1|issue=3|pages=22–32|doi=10.1086/208597}}&lt;/ref&gt; fear strength affects attitude change more than it does intentions. They argue that although persuasion increases when fear rises from low to moderate levels, when rising from moderate to high levels, it actually decreases.

Some have even gone so far as to argue that fear is an entirely unnecessary component of an effective appeal as perceived efficacy is more predictive of intention to change behavior than either element of perceived threat.&lt;ref name = Ruiter2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruiter|first1=R. A. C.|last2=Kok|first2=G.|last3=Verplanken|first3=B.|last4=van Eersel|first4=G.|title=Strengthening the Persuasive Impact of Fear Appeals: The Role of Action Framing|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=143|issue=3|pages=397–400|doi=10.1080/00224540309598452}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tendency for higher levels of fear to raise defensive control responses, it is argued, suggests that fear is not useful and that efficacy may be able to bring about intention and behavior change by itself. Another argument states that since higher levels of personal efficacy are necessary, the target of the fear appeal who is most likely to act is one who is most likely to change his behavior to begin with.&lt;ref name = Ruiter2003/&gt; The implication is that another tact (other than fear) is necessary.

===Perceived threat===
Perceived threat is thought to be an important moderator in the process of fear evoked persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gore|first=T.D.|author2=Bracken, C.C.|title=Testing the theoretical design of a health risk message: Reexamining the major tenets of the extended parallel process model|journal=Health Education &amp; Behavior|year=2005|volume=32|issue=1|pages=27–41|doi=10.1177/1090198104266901}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It consists of both the perceived severity of the threat and the perceived susceptibility to it.

Perceived susceptibility, sometimes referred to as perceived vulnerability, is thought to be key in motivating an individual to act in response to a fear appeal.  It is the perception of the probability and extent to which he/she might experience the threat.  Perceived severity, however, is the degree to which the person believes that they will be harmed if the threat is experienced. These threat components form the perceptual trigger for the fear reaction. Higher levels of perceived susceptibility have been found to increase the degree to which people are critical of the message. An example of a fear appeal of a message that emphasizes perceived severity would be the quote "AIDS leads to death".&lt;ref name=Witte/&gt; These threat components form the perceptual trigger for fear reaction. Higher levels of perceived susceptibility have been found to increase the degree to which people are critical of the message. However, subjects report more positive thoughts about the recommendation and negative emotions associated with the threat when susceptibility is high. Higher levels of perceived susceptibility are associated with greater intention to change behavior in the manner recommended in the fear appeal message, and are a strong determinant of intentions and behavior, even in the face of weak arguments.&lt;ref name=de_Hoog/&gt; It is thought that when perceived susceptibility is high, defense motivations prevent even poor information or weak arguments from detracting from the message's impact on intention. As influential as it appears to be, susceptibility has still been found in some cases to have a much less direct effect on motivation to act on the message than, for instance, self efficacy beliefs or response efficacy.&lt;ref name=Ruiter/&gt;

Perceived severity, the extent to which the individual believes he/she will be adversely affected by the threat has a significant effect on persuasion. A statement that emphasizes the seriousness of a threat would be a statement directed towards a targeted population. An example would be, "You're at-risk for AIDS because you share needles while using intravenous drugs".&lt;ref name=Witte/&gt; In some cases, persuasion has been found to be aided by lowering severity,&lt;ref name="Keller 1999 403–415"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=P.A.|title=Converting the unconverted: The effect of inclination and opportunity to discount health-related fear appeals.|journal=The Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1999|volume=84|issue=3|pages=403–415|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.84.3.403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the majority of the fear appeal research has found just the opposite. However, it is important to distinguish perceived severity of the threat from the actual fear elicited. The former is considered to be an entirely cognitive process, while the latter is an emotional process. Some have even argued that cognitive processes in the context of fear appeals are more important than emotional ones. Research has found that the effect of fear on intentions is mediated by the perceived severity.&lt;ref name=Rogers/&gt; That is, fear does not act directly on intentions, but increases the level of perceived severity, which in turn raises intentions to act on the message. Indeed, the strength of the fear appeal is believed to be positively correlated with the perceived severity of the threat. Severity seems to produce the strongest effects on perceptions.

===Defense mechanisms===
The previous components are thought to determine what response an individual has to the message. One of these potential reactions to the fear appeal that is of the most negative consequence is that of the defensive fear control reaction. In response to the fear appeal, an individual may form the intent to change their behavior. However, when either self or response efficacy is low, the individual, perceiving that they are unable to avert the threat, may rely on defensive avoidance to lower their fear. Some have argued that fear appeals are unnecessary as defensive avoidance reactions have been found in some studies to be positively correlated with strength of fear and negatively with perceived efficacy.
&lt;ref name=Ruiter2003/&gt;
The required balance of fear and efficacy levels has been the subject of much research, with some finding that moderate to high levels of fear are unnecessary in changing intentions. In fact, they argue, what is important is the ratio of these to each other. Gore and Bracken (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bracken | first1 = C. C. | last2 = Gore | first2 = T. D. | year = 2005 | title = Testing the theoretical design of a health risk message: Reexamining the major tenets of the extended parallel process model | url = | journal = Health Education &amp; Behavior | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 27–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
found that even with low levels of threat, they were able to take individuals who had started to exhibit defensive fear control reactions to move toward danger control (intention change) reactions. Another way of defending yourself against fear appeals is prior knowledge, according to one study, individuals are less likely to be influenced by a fear appeal if they have prior knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Averbeck|first=Joshua M |author2=Allison Jones |author3=Kylie Robertson|title=Prior Knowledge and health messages:An Examination Of Affect As Heuristics And Information As Systematic Processing For Fear Appeals|journal=Southern Communication Journal|year=2011|pages=35–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical considerations==

A number of ethical concerns regarding the use of fear appeals have been raised, leading to widespread debate regarding the acceptability of their use. For example, it has been questioned whether it is ethical to expose large numbers of people to potentially distressing messages without their consent. Hastings, Stead and Webb question whether it is ethically acceptable to expose an entire population to a distressing message intended for a specific subset of that population.&lt;ref name=Hastings&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hastings | first1 = G. | last2 = Stead | first2 = M. | last3 = Webb | first3 = J. | year = 2004 | title = Fear appeals in social marketing: Strategic and ethical reasons for concern | url = | journal = Psychology &amp; Marketing | volume = 21 | issue = 11| pages = 961–986 | doi=10.1002/mar.20043}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a fear appeal message stressing the likelihood of premature death for individuals who smoke may also reach the children of people who smoke, leading to avoidable anxiety in such groups.&lt;ref name=Hastings /&gt;

Further to this, it is evident that anxiety responses may not even be helpful when elicited in the target group. This is because, while anxiety can motivate positive health behaviour, it can also be maladaptive, as some individuals form a defensive response to mitigate the negative feeling arising from the fear appeal.&lt;ref name=Blumberg&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blumberg | first1 = S. J. | year = 2000 | title = Guarding against threatening HIV prevention messages: An information-processing model | url = | journal = Health Education &amp; Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = 6| pages = 780–795 | doi=10.1177/109019810002700611}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there have been mixed results regarding whether fear appeals elicit a defense response, it is important to note that studies exploring this relationship are done in a laboratory setting free of external distractions and where participants are told to focus on the health messages.&lt;ref name=Hastings /&gt; It may be that people may have stronger defense responses in real life situations where they must navigate a complex range of competing messages and where they have the option of ignoring the message or looking for competing explanations.&lt;ref name=Hastings /&gt; In addition to this, no studies have followed responses to fear appeals over the longer term, and it possible that repetition of fear appeals may lead to habituation and annoyance, therefore cause individuals to tune out to the messages of the health promotion campaign.&lt;ref name=Hastings /&gt; Furthermore, even if they do work, some authors question whether it is ethical to frighten people in to behaving in a certain way, as this may compromise their [[autonomy]] by manipulating their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tengland | first1 = P. A. | year = 2012 | title = Behavior change or empowerment: on the ethics of health-promotion strategies | url = | journal = Public Health Ethics | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 140–153 | doi=10.1093/phe/phs022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A concern has also been raised that fear appeals serve to contribute to the widening of health disparities. This is because certain individuals are more likely to develop the maladaptive responses mentioned above. Empirical research suggests that fear appeals work best for individuals with high levels of [[self-efficacy]], and that maladaptive responses are more likely in those with low self-efficacy.&lt;ref name=Blumberg /&gt; This means that fear appeals work best for those who are equipped, both physically and psychologically, to take appropriate action. Individuals who do not have the resources for health behaviour change are often those who already have negative health status. For example, people who regularly engage in behaviours which are damaging to health (e.g. smoking and other drug use)  have been found to typically have lower self-efficacy than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conrad | first1 = K. M. | last2 = Flay | first2 = B. R. | last3 = Hill | first3 = D. | year = 1992 | title = Why children start smoking ciga- rettes: Predictors of onset | url = | journal = British Journal of Addiction | volume = 87 | issue = | pages = 1711–1724 | doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1992.tb02684.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Choi | first1 = H. J. | last2 = Krieger | first2 = J. L. | last3 = Hecht | first3 = M. L. | year = 2013 | title = Reconceptualizing efficacy in substance use prevention research: refusal response efficacy and drug resistance self-efficacy in adolescent substance use | url = | journal = Health communication | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 40–52 | doi=10.1080/10410236.2012.720245| pmc = 3924871 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it seems that, in addition to having the potential to cause harm, this harm is more likely to affect groups that would most benefit from health behaviour change, therefore contributing to the widen of health disparities.&lt;ref name=Hastings /&gt;

There is also a concern that fear appeals give rise to [[Social stigma|stigmatisation]] of those who are seen to be already suffering the negative consequences of the undesirable behaviour. For example, injury prevention campaigns often rely on emphasising the negative consequences of potentially becoming disabled. Wang hypothesises that when becoming disabled is portrayed as unacceptable, so is being disabled, adding to the stigmatisation of disabled individuals.&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = C | year = 1992 | title = Culture, meaning and disability: injury prevention campaigns and the production of stigma | url = | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 9| pages = 1093–1102 | doi=10.1016/0277-9536(92)90221-b}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in responses to a poster campaign stating that "Last year, 1057 teenagers got so drunk they couldn't stand up. Ever." presented alongside a picture of a wheelchair, disabled participants in Wang's study felt that this held them up as an example of how not to be. One participant said "I feel it's an attack on my self esteem and dignity."&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''fraternity''' is a kind of [[ethics|ethical]] relationship between people, which is based on [[love]] and [[solidarity]]. A synonym of fraternity is '''brotherhood'''.

Fraternity is mentioned in the national motto of France, ''Liberté, égalité, fraternité'' ([[Liberty, equality, fraternity]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-court-rules-in-favor-of-humanitarian-aid-to-illegal-migrants-1530906461|title=French Court Rules in Favor of Humanitarian Aid to Illegal Migrants|first1=Josh|last1=Jacobs|first2=Sam|last2=Schechner|date=6 July 2018|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of former Yugoslavia ''[[Brotherhood and unity]]''.

The '''GNC hypothesis''' or '''GNC-SNS primeval genetic code hypothesis''' refers to a hypothesis about the origin of genes.  It suggests the universal genetic code originated not from a three-amino acid system, but from a four-amino acid system. It is this GNC code encoding [GADV]-proteins which is the most primitive genetic code. This hypothesis was first proposed by [[Kenji Ikehara]] at Nara Women's University.

==Details==
While almost all of the [[organism]]s on Earth share the universal [[genetic code]], in the GNC hypothesis it is argued that two primeval genetic codes preceded the present genetic code as follows:

* First, there emerged [[Guanine|G]]N[[Cytosine|C]] primeval genetic codes involving 4 [[Genetic code|codons]] (GGC, GCC, G[[Adenine|A]]C and G[[Uracil|U]]C), which code 4 GADV-[[amino acid]]s ([[glycine]], [[alanine]], [[aspartic acid]] and [[valine]]).
* Second, GNC code evolved to SNS primeval genetic codes involving 16 codons (GGC, GGG, GCC, GCG, GAC, GAG, GUC, GUG, CUC, GUG, CCC, CCG, CAC, CAG, CGC and CGG), which code 10 amino acids (glycine, alanine, aspartic acid, valine, [[glutamic acid]], [[leucine]], [[proline]], [[histidine]], [[glutamine]], [[arginine]]).

The GNC hypothesis is based on the following facts:

* [[Protein]]s composed of GADV-amino acids coded by GNC primeval genetic code can form four fundamental structures found in proteins in present organisms, namely, [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] and [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] structures, [[Alpha helix|α-helices]], [[Beta sheet|β-sheets]], and [[turn (biochemistry)|turn]]s (or coils).
* Proteins composed of ten amino acids coded by SNS primeval genetic code can form six fundamental structures, namely, hydrophobic and hydrophilic structures, α-helices, β-sheets, turns, [[acidic]] and [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] fragments.

'''Gwendolyn Galsworth''' is president and founder of Visual Thinking, Inc. and an author, researcher, teacher, consultant, publisher and thought leader in the field of "visuality" in the workplace. Her books, which have won multiple [[Shingo Prize]] awards in the Research and Professional Publication category, focus on conceptualizing and codifying workplace visuality into a single framework called the "visual workplace".

She was one of the ten original members of the [[Productivity Inc.]] team assembled by [[Norman Bodek]] in the early 1980s to establish that company as the premier resource for books and intelligence from Japan that documented and explained what was then called The Japanese Manufacturing Miracle, and is now widely known as the [[Toyota Production System]]. 
 
Today, she continues to consult, teach, and produce books, videos and webinars in her field. She is a frequent keynote speaker on the business improvement conference circuit, and also hosts a weekly web-based radio show called The Visual Workplace, with over 70,000 listeners monthly.

==Early life and education==
Galsworth was born in upper New York State to Russian mother Geraldine and Swiss father Donato Galsworth, she graduated from Long Branch Senior High school, and four years later graduated from Montclair State Teachers College (New Jersey) at the top of her Latin class.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}  After her first year of teaching Latin in Kinnelon, New Jersey, she started an acting career in NYC, studying at the [[Gene Frankel]] Studio. Two years later (1968), Galsworth traveled in Europe for a year and a half, learning French and Italian and continuing to act.

Returning to NYC in the 70s, Galsworth joined an experimental acting group, The Performance Garage, and then traveled back to Europe to study acting with [[Jerzy Grotowski]] in Poland.  That connection brought her to Paris a few months later to audition, by special invitation, for [[Peter Brook]] and his London-based National Repertory Theatre. On her second return to New York, she enrolled in Hunter College for a Master’s in Special Education for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired, with the intention of establishing a theatre where deaf people performed not with the language of signing, such as the National Theatre of the Deaf (NTD) promoted, but through a unique language of physical and sound images that deaf actors would invent from their own expressive needs. Though NTD ultimately dominated the field and Galsworth did not complete this degree, her  interest in visual and sensory language equivalents had begun. 
Galsworth received both her Masters (1981) and PHD in Education and Statistics (1984) from Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Productivity, Inc.==
A chance connection in 1983 led her to Productivity, Inc. and the new offices of  [[Norman Bodek]], where she soon became head of Training, Consulting, and Development. Her work as head of training and development at Productivity brought her into close working contact many Japanese master practitioners, including the co-architect of the Toyota Production System, [[Shigeo Shingo]], head of the Shingijutsu Consulting Group Yoshiki Iwata, Sumitomo’s Ryuji Fukuda, as well as [[Mr. Seiichi Nakajima|Seiichi Nakajima]] and Hiroyuki Hirano.

Over the next six years, Galsworth led study missions to Japan, and worked closely with Dr. Ryuji Fukuda to develop his CEDAC methodology into a process that western companies could deploy. In 1988, a year before his passing, Dr. Shigeo Shingo assigned Galsworth the development of his Poka-Yoke/Zero Defect paradigm into a more complete and western-oriented improvement methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitydigest.com/magazine/2008/nov/article/profiles-quality-gwendolyn-d-galsworth-phd.html# |title=Profiles in Quality with Gwendolyn D. Galsworth, Ph.D |publisher=Quality Digest |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality Methods International, Inc.==
Leaving Productivity in 1990, Galsworth formed Quality Methods International (QMI) in order to specialize in the research, articulation, and deployment of workplace visuality as single, sustainable improvement framework. Since then, she has focused on codifying a range of principles and practices, resulting in an array of methods called the technologies of the visual workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualworkplace.com/about_visuality |title=Visual Workplace Consultants &amp;#124; Visual Thinking Training &amp;#124; Visual Lean Office |publisher=Visualworkplace.com |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this same decade, Galsworth became a Malcolm Baldrige Award Examiner and an examiner for The Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence.  She remained a Shingo Examiner through 2009.

In 2009, The Shigeo Shingo Prize Office at Utah State University invited Galsworth to create an online course on the visual workplace as part of its newly launched Shingo Prize E-Curriculum in Operational Excellence. Its title was The Visual Workplace/Visual Thinking Online Course, the first external course in the Shingo Prize curriculum.

==Visual Thinking, Inc==
In 2012, Galsworth changed the name of her company to Visual Thinking, Inc. to more closely align with its purpose. Shortly before, she was invited to host her own weekly internet radio show on [[VoiceAmerica]], named The Visual Workplace/Work That Makes Sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voiceamerica.com/show/1974/the-visual-workplace |title=The Visual Workplace &amp;#124; VoiceAmerica™ |publisher=Voiceamerica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="330908">The '''history of [[Lorentz transformation]]s''' comprises the development of [[linear map|linear transformations]] forming the [[Lorentz group]] or [[Poincaré group]] preserving the [[Lorentz interval]] &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Minkowski inner product]] &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}y_{0}+\cdots+x_{n}y_{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], transformations equivalent to what was later known as Lorentz transformations in various dimensions were discussed in the 19th century in relation to the theory of [[quadratic form]]s, [[hyperbolic geometry]], [[Möbius geometry]], and [[Spherical wave transformation|sphere geometry]], which is connected to the fact that the group of [[hyperbolic motion|motions in hyperbolic space]], the [[Möbius group]] or [[projective special linear group]], and the [[Spherical wave transformation#Transformation by reciprocal directions|Laguerre group]] are [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Lorentz group]].

In [[physics]], Lorentz transformations became known at the beginning of the 20th century, when it was discovered that they exhibit the symmetry of [[Maxwell's equations]]. Subsequently, they became fundamental to all of physics, because they formed the basis of [[special relativity]] in which they exhibit the symmetry of [[Minkowski spacetime]], making the [[velocity of light]] invariant between different inertial frames. They relate the spacetime coordinates, which specify the position ''x,y,z'' and time ''t'' of an event, relative to a particular [[inertial frame of reference]] (the "rest system"), and the coordinates ''x′,y′,z′'' and ''t′'' of the same event relative to another coordinate system moving in the positive ''x''-direction at a constant speed ''v'', relative to the rest system.

==Overview==

=== Most general Lorentz transformations===

The general [[quadratic form]] ''q(x)'' with coefficients of a [[symmetric matrix]] '''A''', the associated [[bilinear form]] ''b(x,y)'', and the [[linear transformation]]s of ''q(x)'' and ''b(x,y)'' into ''q(x′)'' and ''b(x′,y′)'' using the [[transformation matrix]] '''g''', can be written as&lt;ref&gt;Bôcher (1907), chapter X&lt;/ref&gt;

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\begin{align}\begin{align}q=\sum_{0}^{n}A_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}=\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{x}\end{align} &amp; =q'=\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{\prime T}}\cdot\mathbf{A}'\cdot\mathbf{x}'\\ b=\sum_{0}^{n}A_{ij}x_{i}y_{j}=\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{T}}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{y} &amp; =b'=\mathbf{x}^{\mathrm{\prime T}}\cdot\mathbf{A}'\cdot\mathbf{y}' \end{align} \quad\left(A_{ij}=A_{ji}\right)\\ \hline \left.\begin{align}x_{i} &amp; =\sum_{j=0}^{n}g_{ij}x_{j}^{\prime}=\mathbf{g}\cdot\mathbf{x}'\\ x_{i}^{\prime} &amp; =\sum_{j=0}^{n}g_{ij}^{(-1)}x_{j}=\mathbf{g}^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{x} \end{align} \right|\mathbf{g}^{{\rm T}}\cdot\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{g}=\mathbf{A}' \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{equationRef|Q1}}}}

The case ''n=1'' is the [[binary quadratic form]] introduced by [[#Gauss|Lagrange (1773) and Gauss (1798/1801)]], ''n=2'' is the ternary quadratic form introduced by [[#Gauss2|Gauss (1798/1801)]], ''n=3'' is the quaternary quadratic form etc.

The general Lorentz transformation follows from ({{equationNote|Q1}}) by setting '''A'''='''A′'''=diag(-1,1,...,1) and det '''g'''=1.

The cases ''n=1,2,3,4'' of this quadratic form with real numbers and its transformation was discussed by [[#Euler|Euler (1771)]] and in ''n'' dimensions by [[#Cauchy|Cauchy (1829)]]. Its interpretation as leaving invariant the equation of the sphere with imaginary radius was given by [[#Lie|Lie (1871)]], its interpretation as a Lorentz transformation with ''n=3'' using one imaginary coordinate was given by [[#Minkowski|Minkowski (1907)]] and [[#Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld (1909)]].

A well known example of an orthogonal transformation is spatial rotation:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\mathfrak{x}_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=\mathfrak{x}_{0}^{\prime2}+x_{1}^{\prime2}+x_{2}^{\prime2}\\

This quadratic form and its transformation with real numbers and real angle was discussed by [[#Euler|Euler (1771)]], its interpretation as a Lorentz transformation using one imaginary coordinate and imaginary angle was given by [[#Minkowski|Minkowski (1907)]]  and [[#Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld (1909)]].

===Lorentz transformation via hyperbolic functions===

The case of a Lorentz transformation without spatial rotation is called a [[Lorentz boost]]. The simplest case can be given, for instance, by setting ''n=1'' in ({{equationNote|1a}}):

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}-x_0^2+x_1^2=-x_{0}^{\prime2}+x_{1}^{\prime2}\\
\hline \begin{align}x_0 &amp; =x_0^{\prime} g_{00}+x_1^{\prime}g_{01}\\
x_1 &amp; =x_0^{\prime} g_{10}+x_{1}^{\prime}g_{11}\\
\\
x_0^{\prime} &amp; =x_0 g_{00}-x_{1}g_{10}\\
x_1^{\prime} &amp; =-x_0 g_{01}+x_{1}g_{11}
\end{align}
\left|\begin{align}g_{01}^{2}-g_{00}^{2} &amp; =-1\\
g_{11}^2-g_{10}^{2} &amp; =1\\
g_{01}g_{11}-g_{00}g_{10} &amp; =0\\
g_{10}^{2}-g_{00}^{2} &amp; =-1\\
g_{11}^{2}-g_{01}^{2} &amp; =1\\
g_{10}g_{11}-g_{00}g_{01} &amp; =0

\rightarrow\begin{align}g_{00}^2 &amp; =g_{11}^2 \\
g_{01}^2 &amp; =g_{10}^2
\end{align}
\right.
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{equationRef|3a}}}}

which resembles precisely the relations of [[hyperbolic function]]s by setting ''g&lt;sub&gt;00&lt;/sub&gt;=g&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;''=cosh(η) and ''g&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;=g&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''=sinh(η), with η as the [[hyperbolic angle]]. Thus by adding an unchanged ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''-axis, a Lorentz boost for ''n=2'' representing a translation in the hyperbolic plane in terms of Weierstrass coordinates of the [[hyperboloid model]] along one axis (being the same as a rotation around an imaginary angle ''iη=φ'' in ({{equationNote|2b}})) is given by

===Lorentz transformation via velocity===
In the [[theory of relativity]], Lorentz transformations exhibit the symmetry of [[Minkowski spacetime]] by using a constant ''c'' as the [[speed of light]], and a parameter ''v'' as the relative [[velocity]] between two [[inertial reference frames]]. In particular, the hyperbolic angle η in ({{equationNote|3b}}) can be interpreted as the velocity related [[rapidity]] η=atanh(β) with β=''v/c'', so that γ=cosh(η) is the [[Lorentz factor]], βγ=sinh(η) the [[proper velocity]], ''v=c''·tanh(η) the relative velocity of two inertial frames, ''u′=c''·tanh(ζ) the velocity of another object, ''u=c''·tanh(η+ζ) the [[velocity-addition formula]], thus ({{equationNote|3b}}) becomes:

[[#Minkowski|Minkowski (1907–1908)]] and [[#Varicak|Varićak (1910)]] showed the relation to imaginary and hyperbolic functions.

===Lorentz transformation via spherical wave transformation===

{{Main|Spherical wave transformation|Lie sphere geometry}}

A general sphere transformation preserving the quadratic form &lt;math&gt;\lambda\left(-x_{0}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the group Con(p,1) of spacetime [[conformal transformation]]s in terms of inversions or [[special conformal transformation]]s, which has the property of changing spheres into spheres. One can switch between the representations by using an imaginary radius coordinate ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=iR'' which gives &lt;math&gt;\lambda\left(x_{0}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (conformal transformation), or by using a real radius coordinate ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=R'' which gives &lt;math&gt;\lambda\left(-x_{0}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; (spherical wave transformation). This group was studied by [[#Lie|Lie (1871)]] and others in terms of contact transformations, in which ''x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is related to the radius ''R''.

It turns out that Con(3,1) is isomorphic to the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(4,2), and contains the Lorentz group SO(3,1) as a subgroup by setting λ=1. More generally, Con(p,q) is isomorphic to SO(p+1,q+1) and contains SO(p,q) as subgroup.&lt;ref&gt;Schottenloher (2008), section 2.2&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that Con(p,0) is isomorphic to the Lorentz group of arbitrary dimensions SO(p+1,1). Consequently, the conformal group in the plane Con(2,0) – known as the group of [[Möbius transformation]]s – is isomorphic to the Lorentz group SO(3,1).&lt;ref&gt;Kastrup (2008), section 2.4.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schottenloher (2008), section 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen using tetracyclical coordinates satisfying the form &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt;, which were discussed by [[#Klein4|Pockels (1891), Klein (1893), Bôcher (1894)]].

A special case of Lie's geometry of oriented spheres is the [[Spherical wave transformation#Transformation by reciprocal directions|Laguerre group]], transforming oriented planes and lines into each other. It's generated by the Laguerre inversion introduced by [[#Laguerre|Laguerre (1882)]] and discussed by [[#Darboux|Darboux (1887)]] leaving invariant ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' with ''R'' as radius, thus the Laguerre group is isomorphic to the Lorentz group

[[#Stephanos|Stephanos (1883)]] argued that Lie's geometry of oriented spheres in terms of contact transformations, as well as the special case of the transformations of oriented planes into each other (such as by Laguerre), provides a geometrical interpretation of Hamilton's [[biquaternion]]s.

The relation between Lie's sphere transformations and the Lorentz transformation was noted by [[#Bateman|Bateman &amp; Cunningham (1909–1910)]] and others. Furthermore, the [[group isomorphism]] between the Laguerre group and Lorentz group was pointed out by [[#Bateman|Bateman (1910), Cartan (1912, 1915/55), Poincaré (1912/21)]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Coolidge (1916), p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cartan &amp; Fano (1915/55), sections 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lorentz transformation via Cayley–Hermite transformation ===

The general transformation ({{equationNote|Q1}}) of any quadratic form into itself can also be given using ''arbitrary'' parameters based on the [[Cayley transform]] ('''I'''-'''T''')&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;·('''I'''+'''T''') as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins (2013), pp. 210–214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyer (1899), p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;|{{equationRef|Q2}}}}

where '''A''' is, as above, a symmetric matrix defining the quadratic form (there is no primed '''A' ''' because the coefficients are assumed to be the same on both sides), '''I''' the [[identity matrix]], and '''T''' an arbitrary [[antisymmetric matrix]]. After [[#Cayley|Cayley (1846)]] introduced transformations related to sums of positive squares, [[#Hermite|Hermite (1853/54, 1854)]] derived transformations for arbitrary quadratic forms, whose result was reformulated in terms of matrices ({{equationNote|Q2}}) by [[#Cayley|Cayley (1855a, 1855b)]]. For instance, the choice '''A'''=diag(1,1,1) gives an orthogonal transformation which can be used to describe spatial rotations corresponding to the [[Euler–Rodrigues formula|Euler-Rodrigues parameter]]s ''[a,b,c,d]'' discovered by [[#Euler|Euler (1771) and Rodrigues (1840)]], which can be interpreted as the coefficients of [[quaternion]]s. Setting ''d=1'', the equations have the form:

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\left.\begin{matrix}x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=x_{0}^{\prime2}+x_{1}^{\prime2}+x_{2}^{\prime2}\\

As shown in the next section in equation ({{equationNote|6c}}), many authors (some before Cayley) expressed the invariance of &lt;math&gt;X_{2}^{2}-X_{1}X_{3}&lt;/math&gt; and its relation to the Lorentz interval by using the alternative Cayley–Klein parameters and Möbius transformations.

===Lorentz transformation via Cayley–Klein parameters, Möbius and spin transformations===

The previously mentioned Euler-Rodrigues parameter ''a,b,c,d'' (i.e. Cayley-Hermite parameter in equation ({{equationNote|Q3}}) with ''d=1'') are closely related to Cayley–Klein parameter α,β,γ,δ introduced by [[#Cayley2|Helmholtz (1866/67), Cayley (1879)]] and [[#Klein|Klein (1884)]] to connect Möbius transformations &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\alpha\zeta+\beta}{\gamma\zeta+\delta}&lt;/math&gt; and rotations:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1896/97), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\alpha &amp; =1+ib, &amp; \beta &amp; =-a+ic,\\
\gamma &amp; =a+ic, &amp; \delta &amp; =1-ib.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

thus ({{equationNote|Q3}}) becomes:

Also the Lorentz transformation can be expressed with variants of the Cayley–Klein parameters: One relates these parameters to a spin-matrix '''D''', the [[spin transformation]]s of variables &lt;math&gt;\xi',\eta',\bar{\xi}',\bar{\eta}'&lt;/math&gt; (the overline denotes [[complex conjugate]]), and the [[Möbius transformation]] of &lt;math&gt;\zeta',\bar{\zeta}'&lt;/math&gt;. When defined in terms of isometries of hyperblic space (hyperbolic motions), the [[Hermitian matrix]] '''u''' associated with these Möbius transformations produces an invariant determinant &lt;math&gt;\det\mathbf{u}=x_{0}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}-x_{3}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; identical to the Lorentz interval. Therefore, these transformations were described by [[John Lighton Synge]] as being a "factory for the mass production of Lorentz transformations".&lt;ref name=synge /&gt; It also turns out that the related [[spin group]] Spin(3, 1) or [[special linear group]] SL(2, C) acts as the [[Double cover (topology)|double cover]] of the Lorentz group (one Lorentz transformation corresponds to two spin transformations of different sign), while the [[Möbius group]] Con(2, 0) or [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2, C) is isomorphic to both the Lorentz group and the group of isometries of hyperbolic space.

In four dimensions, these Lorentz transformations can be represented as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Klein (1928), § 3A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=synge&gt;Synge (1956), ch.

The general transformation '''u′''' in ({{equationNote|6a}}) was given by [[#Cayley2|Cayley (1854)]]. The Möbius transformation in ({{equationNote|6a}}) was used as a Lorentz transformation by [[#Poincare2|Poincaré (1881)]] and [[#Hausdorff|Hausdorff (1899)]] for the special case ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=-1 and the resulting Lorentz interval &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}^{\prime2}+x_{1}^{\prime2}+x_{2}^{\prime2}=-1&lt;/math&gt; (hyperboloid in three dimensions). The general relation between Möbius transformations and transformation '''u′''' leaving invariant the [[generalized circle]] was pointed out by [[#Poincare2|Poincaré (1883)]] in relation to [[Kleinian group]]s, and by [[#Klein2|Klein (1884)]] in relation to surfaces of second degree and the invariance of the unit sphere. The invariance of the complete Lorentz interval using '''u′''' as Lorentz transformation was demonstrated by [[#Klein2|Klein (1889-1893), 1896/97)]], [[#Bianchi|Bianchi (1893)]], [[#Fricke|Fricke (1893, 1897)]]. Its reformulation as Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|6d}}) was provided by [[#Bianchi|Bianchi (1893)]] and [[#Fricke|Fricke (1893, 1897)]]. In relativity, ({{equationNote|6a}}) was first employed by [[#Herglotz1|Herglotz (1909/10)]].

The general transformation '''u′''' and its invariant &lt;math&gt;X_{2}^{2}-X_{1}X_{3}&lt;/math&gt; in ({{equationNote|6c}}) was already used by [[#Gauss|Lagrange (1773) and Gauss (1798/1801)]] in the theory of integer binary quadratic forms. The invariant &lt;math&gt;X_{2}^{2}-X_{1}X_{3}&lt;/math&gt; was also studied by [[#Klein|Klein (1871)]] in connection to hyperbolic plane geometry (see equation ({{equationNote|3c}})), while the connection between '''u′''' and &lt;math&gt;X_{2}^{2}-X_{1}X_{3}&lt;/math&gt; with the Möbius transformation was analyzed by [[#Poincare2|Poincaré (1886)]] in relation to [[Fuchsian group]]s.  The adaptation to the Lorentz interval by which ({{equationNote|6c}}) becomes a Lorentz transformation was given by [[#Bianchi|Bianchi (1888)]] and [[#Fricke|Fricke (1891)]]. The Lorentz Transformation in the form of ({{equationNote|6d}}) was explicitly stated by [[#Gauss3|Gauss around 1800]] (posthumously published 1863), as well as [[#Selling|Selling (1873)]], [[#Bianchi|Bianchi (1888)]], [[#Fricke|Fricke (1891)]] in relation to integer indefinite ternary quadratic forms.

The Lorentz transformations can also be expressed in terms of [[biquaternion]]s having one real part ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' and one purely imaginary part ''ix&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' (some authors use the opposite convention). Its general form (on the left) and the corresponding boost (on the right) are as follows (where the overline denotes Hamiltonian conjugation and * complex conjugation):&lt;ref&gt;Synge (1972), pp. 13, 19, 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Girard (1984), pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[#Cayley3|Cayley (1854, 1855)]] derived quaternion transformations leaving invariant the sum of squares &lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. [[#Cox2|Cox (1882/83)]] discussed the Lorentz interval in terms of Weierstrass coordinates &lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}=1&lt;/math&gt; in the course of adapting [[William Kingdon Clifford]]'s biquaternions ''a+ωb'' to hyperbolic geometry (ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1 for hyperbolic geometry, ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1 elliptic, ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0 parabolic). [[#Stephanos|Stephanos (1883)]] related the imaginary part of [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s biquaternions to the radius of spheres, and introduced a homography leaving invariant the equations of oriented spheres or oriented planes in terms of [[Lie sphere geometry]]. [[#Buchheim|Buchheim (1884/85)]] discussed the Cayley absolute &lt;math&gt;x_{0}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt; and adapted Clifford's biquaternions to hyperbolic geometry similar to Cox by using all three values of ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Eventually, the modern Lorentz transformation using biquaternions with ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1 as in hyperbolic geometry was given by [[#Noether|Noether (1910), Klein (1910), Conway (1911), Silberstein (1911)]].

Often connected with quaternionic systems is the [[hyperbolic number]] ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1, which also allows to formulate the Lorentz transformations:&lt;ref&gt;Sobczyk (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fjelstad (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trigonometric expression e&lt;sup&gt;ix&lt;/sup&gt;=cos(x)+i·sin(x) ([[Euler's formula]]) was given by [[#Euler's gap|Euler (1748)]] and the hyperbolic analogue e&lt;sup&gt;εη&lt;/sup&gt; by [[#Cox2|Cockle (1848)]] in the framework of [[tessarine]]s, it was shown by [[#Cox2|Cox (1882/83)]] that one can identify ww′&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=e&lt;sup&gt;εη&lt;/sup&gt; with associative quaternion multiplication. Here, e&lt;sup&gt;εη&lt;/sup&gt; is the hyperbolic [[versor]] with ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1, the elliptic one follows with ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1, and parabolic with ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0 (this should not be confused with the expression ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in Clifford's biquaternions also used by Cox, in which ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1 is hyperbolic). The hyperbolic versor was also discussed by [[#Macfarlane|Macfarlane (1892, 1894, 1900)]] in terms of [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s. The expression ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1 for hyperbolic motions (and ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1 for elliptic, ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0 for parabolic motions) also appear in "biquaternions" defined by [[#Vahlen|Vahlen (1901/02, 1905)]].

More extended forms of complex and (bi-)quaternionic systems in terms of [[Clifford algebra]] can also be used to express the Lorentz transformations. For instance, using a system ''a'' of Clifford numbers one can transform the following general quadratic form into itself, in which the individual values of &lt;math&gt;i_{1}^{2},i_{2}^{2},\dots&lt;/math&gt; can be set to +1 or -1 at will:&lt;ref&gt;Cartan &amp; Study (1908), section 36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothe (1916), section 16&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}i_{1}^{2}x_{1}^{\prime2}+\cdots+i_{n}^{2}x_{n}^{\prime2}=i_{1}^{2}x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+i_{n}^{2}x_{n}^{2}\\
\hline (1)\ x'=axa^{-1}\\
(2)\ x'=\frac{ax+b}{\varepsilon^{2} bx+a}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The Lorentz interval follows if the sign of one i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; differs from all others. The general definite form &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{n}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; as well as the general indefinite form &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+x_{p}^{2}-x_{p+1}^{2}-\cdots-x_{p+q}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and their invariance under transformation (1) was discussed by [[#Lipschitz|Lipschitz (1885/86)]], while hyperbolic motions were discussed by [[#Vahlen|Vahlen (1901/02, 1905)]] by setting ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1 in transformation (2), while elliptic motions follow with ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1 and parabolic motions ε&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0, all of which he also related to biquaternions.

After [[Vincenzo Riccati]] introduced hyperbolic functions in 1757,&lt;ref group=M&gt;Günther (1880), pp. 7–13&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] (read 1767, published 1768) gave the following relations, in which ''tang ''φ  or abbreviated ''tφ'' was equated by Lambert to the [[tangens hyperbolicus]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \frac{e^{u}-e^{-u}}{e^{u}+e^{-u}}&lt;/math&gt; of a variable ''u'', or in modern notation ''tφ=tanh(u)'':&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lambert (1761/68), pp. 309–318&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnett (2004), pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\begin{align}\xi\xi-1 &amp; =\eta\eta &amp; (a)\\
1+\eta\eta &amp; =\xi\xi &amp; (b)\\
\frac{\eta}{\xi} &amp; =tang\ \phi=t\phi &amp; (c)\\

t\phi' &amp; =\frac{t\phi''-t\phi}{1-t\phi\cdot t\phi''} &amp; (g)
\end{align}
\right|\begin{align}2u &amp; =\log\frac{1+t\phi}{1-t\phi}\\

e^{u} &amp; =\xi+\eta\\
e^{-u} &amp; =\xi-\eta
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In (1770) he rewrote the addition law for the hyperbolic tangens (f) or (g) as:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lambert (1770), p. 335&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}t(y+z) &amp; =(ty+tz):(1+ty\cdot tz) &amp; (f)\\
t(y-z) &amp; =(ty-tz):(1-ty\cdot tz) &amp; (g)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=The hyperbolic relations (a,b,c,d,e) are equivalent to the hyperbolic relations on the right of ({{equationNote|3b}}). In addition, by setting ''tφ=v/c'', (c) becomes the relative velocity between two frames, (d) the [[Lorentz factor]], (e) the [[proper velocity]], (f) or (g) becomes the Lorentz transformation of velocity (or relativistic [[velocity addition formula]]) for collinear velocities in ({{equationNote|4a}}).}}

[[Leonhard Euler]] (1771) demonstrated the invariance of quadratic forms in terms of sum of squares under a linear substitution and its coefficients, now known as [[orthogonal transformation]], as well as under rotations using [[Euler angles]]. The case of two dimensions is given by&lt;ref group=M&gt;Euler (1771), pp. 84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

These coefficiens ''A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I'' were related by Euler to four arbitrary parameter ''p,q,r,s'', which where rediscovered by [[Olinde Rodrigues]] (1840) who related them to rotation angles&lt;ref group=M&gt;Rodrigues (1840), p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; now called [[Euler–Rodrigues formula|Euler–Rodrigues parameters]] in line with equation ({{equationNote|Q3}}):&lt;ref group=M&gt;&gt;Euler (1771), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Gauss}} Gauss (1798–1818)===

===={{anchor|Gauss1}} Binary quadratic forms====

After the invariance of the sum of squares under linear substitutions was discussed by [[#Euler|Euler (1771)]], the general expressions of a [[binary quadratic form]] and its transformation was formulated by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] (1773) as follows&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lagrange (1773), section 22&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}py^{2}+2qyz+rz^{2}=Ps^{2}+2Qsx+Rx^{2}\\
\hline \begin{align}y &amp; =Ms+Nx\\
z &amp; =ms+nx
\end{align}
\left|\begin{matrix}\begin{align}P &amp; =pM^{2}+2qMm+rm^{2}\\
Q &amp; =pMN+q(Mn+Nm)+rmn\\
R &amp; =pN^{2}+2qNn+rn^{2}
\end{align}
\\
\downarrow\\
PR-Q^{2}=\left(pr-q^{2}\right)(Mn-Nm)^{2}
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to ({{equationNote|Q1}}) ''(n=1)''. The theory of binary quadratic forms was considerably expanded by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1798, published 1801) in his [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]. He rewrote Lagrange's formalism as follows using integer coefficients α,β,γ,δ:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Gauss (1798/1801), articles 157–158;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}F=ax^{2}+2bxy+cy^{2}=(a,b,c)\\
F'=a'x^{\prime2}+2b'x'y'+c'y^{\prime2}=(a',b',c')\\
\hline \begin{align}x &amp; =\alpha x'+\beta y'\\
y &amp; =\gamma x'+\delta y'\\
\\
x' &amp; =\delta x-\beta y\\
y' &amp; =-\gamma x+\alpha y
\end{align}
\left|\begin{matrix}\begin{align}a' &amp; =a\alpha^{2}+2b\alpha\gamma+c\gamma^{2}\\
b' &amp; =a\alpha\beta+b(\alpha\delta+\beta\gamma)+c\gamma\delta\\
c' &amp; =a\beta^{2}+2b\beta\delta+c\delta^{2}
\end{align}
\\
\downarrow\\
b^{2}-a'c'=\left(b^{2}-ac\right)(\alpha\delta-\beta\gamma)^{2}
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to ({{equationNote|Q1}}) ''(n=1)''. As pointed out by Gauss, ''F'' and ''F' '' are called "proper equivalent" if αδ-βγ=1, so that ''F'' is contained in ''F' '' as well as ''F' '' is contained in ''F''. In addition, if another form ''F"'' is contained by the same procedure in ''F' '' it is also contained in ''F'' and so forth.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Gauss (1798/1801), section 159&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=The Lorentz interval &lt;math&gt;-x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|1a}}) ''(n=1)'' are a special case of the binary quadratic form of Lagrange and Gauss by setting ''(a,b,c)=(a',b',c')=(1,0,-1)''.

Alternatively, the transformation of coefficients ''(a,b,c)'' corresponds to Lorentz transformation '''u′''' in ({{equationNote|6c}}) by setting

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}(a,b,c) &amp; =\left(x_{0}+x_{2},\ x_{1},\ x_{0}-x_{2}\right)\\
(a',b',c') &amp; =\left(x_{0}^{\prime}+x_{2}^{\prime},\ x_{1}^{\prime},\ x_{0}^{\prime}-x_{2}^{\prime}\right)

&lt;/math&gt;.}}

===={{anchor|Gauss2}} Ternary quadratic forms====

Gauss (1798/1801)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Gauss (1798/1801), articles 266–285&lt;/ref&gt; also discussed ternary quadratic forms with the general expression

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}f=ax^{2}+a'x^{\prime2}+a''x^{\prime\prime2}+2bx'x''+2b'xx''+2b''xx'=\left(\begin{matrix}a, &amp; a', &amp; a''\\
b, &amp; b', &amp; b''
\end{matrix}\right)\\
g=my^{2}+m'y^{\prime2}+m''y^{\prime\prime2}+2ny'y''+2n'yy''+2n''yy'=\left(\begin{matrix}m, &amp; m', &amp; m''\\
n, &amp; n', &amp; n''
\end{matrix}\right)\\
\hline \begin{align}x &amp; =\alpha y+\beta y'+\gamma y''\\
x' &amp; =\alpha'y+\beta'y'+\gamma'y''\\
x'' &amp; =\alpha''y+\beta''y'+\gamma''y''
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

which is equivalent to ({{equationNote|Q1}}) ''(n=2)''. Gauss called these forms definite when they have the same sign such as ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', or indefinite in the case of different signs such as ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. While discussing the classification of ternary quadratic forms &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle \left(\begin{matrix}a, &amp; a', &amp; a''\\
b, &amp; b', &amp; b''
\end{matrix}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;, Gauss (1801) presented twenty special cases, among them these six variants:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Gauss (1798/1801), article 277&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\left(\begin{matrix}1, &amp; -1, &amp; 1\\

\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=These are all six types of Lorentz interval in 2+1 dimensions that can be produced as special cases of a ternary quadratic form. In general: The Lorentz interval &lt;math&gt;x^{2}+x^{\prime2}-x^{\prime\prime2}&lt;/math&gt; and the Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|1a}}) ''(n=2)'' is an indefinite ternary quadratic form, which follows from the general ternary form by setting:

===={{anchor|Cayley4}} Cayley absolute and hyperbolic geometry====

In 1859, Cayley found out that a quadratic form or projective [[quadric]] can be used as an "absolute", serving as the basis of a projective metric (the [[Cayley–Klein metric]]).&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cayley (1859), sections 209–229&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, using the absolute ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0'', he defined the distance of two points as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\cos^{-1}\frac{xx'+yy'+zz'}{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}}\sqrt{x^{\prime2}+y^{\prime2}+z^{\prime2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and he also alluded to the case of the unit sphere ''x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1''. In the hands of [[#Klein|Klein (1871)]], all of this became essential for the discussion of non-Euclidean geometry (in particular the [[Beltrami–Klein model|Cayley–Klein or Beltrami–Klein model]] of hyperbolic geometry) and associated quadratic forms and transformations, including the Lorentz interval and Lorentz transformation.

Cayley (1884) himself also discussed some properties of the Beltrami–Klein model and the pseudosphere, and formulated coordinate transformations using the Cayley-Hermite formalism:&lt;ref group=M name=c84&gt;Cayley (1884), section 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

By using [[#Cayley|Cayley's (1846)]] method of skew–symmetric coefficients, he derived a transformation leaving invariant almost all types of ternary quadratic forms.&lt;ref group=M name=herm&gt;Hermite (1853/54a), p. 307ff.&lt;/ref&gt; This was generalized by him in 1854 to all dimensions, so Hermite arrived at a transformation scheme leaving invariant almost all types of quadratic forms:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Hermite (1854b), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins (2013), p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

This result was subsequently expressed in matrix form by [[#Cayley|Cayley (1855)]].

In his lecture in the summer semester of 1890 (published 1892–93), he discussed general surfaces of second degree, including an "oval" surface corresponding to hyperbolic space and its motions:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1893b); general surface: pp. 61–66, 116–119, hyperbolic space: pp. 82, 86, 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;

Klein's work was summarized and extended [[#Fricke|Fricke (1893, 1897)]] (supported by Klein).

===={{anchor|Klein3}} Spiral transformation====

In 1890 Klein discussed a general type of Euclidean or Non-Euclidean motion in relation to a problem posed by Helmholtz (1868), with the following transformation&lt;ref group=M name=klein1890&gt;Klein (1890b), p. 565&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x'+iy'=e^{(\alpha+i\beta)t}(x+iy)+a+ib&lt;/math&gt;

In 1893 he called the special case with ''a=b=0'' a "spiral transformation":&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1893c), p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x'+iy' &amp; =e^{(\alpha+i\beta)t}(x+iy) &amp; \text{(1)}\\
x'-iy' &amp; =e^{(\alpha-i\beta)t}(x-iy) &amp; \text{(2)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=The Lorentz boost ({{equationNote|3c}}) can be formulated by setting &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}[][\beta,\ iy,\ iy'] &amp; =[0,\ y,\ y']\ \text{(1,2)}\\
t &amp; =-t\ \text{(1)}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;}}

===={{anchor|Klein4}} Conformal transformation and polyspherical coordinates====

In relation to line geometry, Klein (1871/72)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1871/72), p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; used coordinates satisfying the condition &lt;math&gt;s_{1}^{2}+s_{2}^{2}+s_{2}^{2}+s_{2}^{2}+s_{5}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt;. They were introduced in 1868 (belatedly published in 1872/73) by [[Gaston Darboux]]&lt;ref group=M&gt;Darboux (1872/73), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; as a system of five coordinates in ''R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' (later called "pentaspherical" coordinates) in which the last coordinate is imaginary. [[Sophus Lie]] (1871)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1871), p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; more generally used ''n+2'' coordinates in ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' (later called "polyspherical" coordinates) satisfying &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sum_{i=1}^{i=n+2}x_{i}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt; in which the last coordinate is imaginary, as a means to discuss conformal transformations generated by inversions. These simultaneous publications can be explained by the fact that Darboux, Lie, and Klein corresponded with each other by letter.

When the last coordinate is defined as real, the corresponding polyspherical coordinates satisfy the form of a sphere.  Initiated by lectures of Klein between 1889–1890, his student [[Friedrich Carl Alwin Pockels|Friedrich Pockels]] (1891) used such real coordinates, emphasizing that all of these coordinate systems remain invariant under conformal transformations generated by inversions:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Pockels (1891), pp. 197–206&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_{n+1}^2-x_{n+2}^2=0 \text{ or } \sum_1^{n+1} x_h^2-x_{n+2}^2=0&lt;/math&gt;

Special cases were described by Klein (1893):&lt;ref group=M&gt;Klein (1893c), pp. 200ff (pentaspherical), pp. 373ff (tetracyclical)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;y_1^2+y_2^2+y_3^2+y_4^2-y_5^2=0&lt;/math&gt; (pentaspherical).

:&lt;math&gt;x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2-x_4^2=0&lt;/math&gt; (tetracyclical).

Both systems were also described by [[Maxime Bôcher]] (1894) in an expanded version of a thesis supervised by Klein.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Bôcher (1894), pp. 30–34, 40–43&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=Polyspherical coordinates indicate that the conformal group {{nowrap|Con(p,0)}} is isomorphic to the Lorentz group SO(p+1,1).&lt;ref&gt;Kastrup (2008), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Con(2,0) – known as Möbius group – is related to tetracyclical coordinates satisfying &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}-x_{4}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt;, which is nothing other than the Lorentz interval invariant under the Lorentz group SO(3,1).}}

==={{anchor|Lie}} Lie (1871–1893)===

===={{anchor|Lie1}} Conformal, spherical, and orthogonal transformations====

In several papers between 1847 and 1850 it was shown by [[Joseph Liouville]]&lt;ref group=M&gt;Liouville (1847)&lt;/ref&gt; that the relation ''λ(δx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+δy&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+δz&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'' is invariant under the group of [[conformal transformation]]s generated by [[Spherical wave transformation#Transformation by reciprocal radii|inversions]] transforming spheres into spheres, which can be related [[special conformal transformation]]s or [[Möbius transformation]]s. (The conformal nature of the linear fractional transformation &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{a+bz}{c+dz}&lt;/math&gt; of a complex variable &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; was already discussed by Euler (1777)).&lt;ref group=M&gt;Euler (1777), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kastrup&gt;Kastrup (2008), section 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Liouville's theorem was extended to all dimensions by [[Sophus Lie]] (1871a).&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1871), pp. 199–209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kastrup (2008), section 2.3&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Lie described a manifold whose elements can be represented by spheres, where the last coordinate ''y&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be related to an imaginary radius by ''iy&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'':&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1871a), pp. 199–209&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} (x_i-y_i)^2+y_{n+1}^2=0 \\
\downarrow\\
\sum_{i=1}^{i=n+1} (y_i^{\prime}-y_i^{\prime\prime})^2=0
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the second equation is satisfied, two spheres ''y′'' and ''y″'' are in contact. Lie then defined the correspondence between [[Contact geometry|contact transformations]] in ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' and conformal point transformations in ''R&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;'': The sphere of space ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' consists of ''n+1'' parameter (coordinates plus imaginary radius), so if this sphere is taken as the element of space ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', it follows that ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' now corresponds to ''R&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''. Therefore, any transformation (to which he counted [[#Lorentz transformation via orthogonal transformation|orthogonal transformations]] and inversions) leaving invariant the condition of contact between spheres in ''R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'', corresponds to the transformation of points in ''R&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt;''.

Eventually, Lie (1871/72) pointed out that the conformal point transformations of ''R&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' consist of motions (such as [[rigid transformation]]s and orthogonal transformations), similarity transformations, and inversions.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1871/72), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=As shown by [[#Bateman|Bateman and Cunningham (1909)]], the spacetime conformal group Con(3,1) of "[[spherical wave transformation]]s" corresponds to the transformations of Lie's sphere geometry in which the radius indicates the fourth coordinate, while the Lorentz group SO(3,1) is a subgroup of Con(3,1).}}

===={{anchor|Lie2}} Lie group, hyperbolic motions, and infinitesimal transformations====

In (1885/86), Lie identified the projective group of a general surface of second degree &lt;math&gt;\sum f_{ik}x_{i}'x_{k}'=0&lt;/math&gt; with the group of non-Euclidean motions.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1885/86), p. 411&lt;/ref&gt; In a thesis guided by Lie, [[Hermann Werner]] (1889) discussed this projective group by using the equation of a unit sphere as the surface of second degree, and also gave the corresponding infinitesimal projective transformations:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Werner (1889), pp. 4, 28&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}=1\\
\hline x_{i}p_{\varkappa}-x_{\varkappa}p_{i},\quad p_{i}-x_{i}\sum_{1}^{n}{\scriptstyle j}\ x_{j}p_{j}\quad(i,\varkappa=1,\dots, n)\\

\left(Q_{i},Q_{\varkappa}\right)=R_{i,\varkappa};\ \left(Q_{i},Q_{j,\varkappa}\right)=\varepsilon_{i,j}Q_{\varkappa}-\varepsilon_{i,\varkappa}Q_{j};\\
\left(R_{i,\varkappa},R_{\mu,\nu}\right)=\varepsilon_{\varkappa,\mu}R_{i,\nu}-\varepsilon_{\varkappa,\nu}R_{i,\mu}-\varepsilon_{,\mu}R_{\varkappa,\nu}+\varepsilon_{i,\nu}R_{\varkappa,\mu}\\
\left[\varepsilon_{i,\varkappa}\equiv0\ \text{for}\ i\ne\varkappa;\ \varepsilon_{i,i}=1\right]
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, Lie (1890)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1890a), p. 295;&lt;/ref&gt; defined non-Euclidean motions in terms of two forms &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}\pm1=0&lt;/math&gt; in which the imaginary form with &lt;math&gt;+1&lt;/math&gt; denotes the group of elliptic motions (in Klein's terminology), the real form with −1 the group of hyperbolic motions, with the latter having the same form as Werner's transformation:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1890a), p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x_{1}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}-1=0\\
\hline p_{k}-x_{k}\sum j_{1}^{0}x_{j}p_{j},\quad x_{i}p_{k}-x_{k}p_{i}\quad(i,k=1\dots n)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Summarizing, Lie (1893) discussed the real continuous groups of the conic sections representing non-Euclidean motions, which in the case of hyperbolic motions have the form:

:&lt;math&gt;x^{2}+y^{2}-1=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1893), p. 474&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}-1=0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1893), p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; or &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}-1=0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Lie (1893), p. 481&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=The group of hyperbolic motions is isomorphic to the Lorentz group. The interval &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}-1=0&lt;/math&gt; becomes the Lorentz interval &lt;math&gt;x_{1}^{2}+\dots+x_{n}^{2}-x_{0}^{2}=0&lt;/math&gt; by setting

==={{anchor|Selling}} Selling (1873–74) – Quadratic forms===

Continuing the work of [[#Gauss2|Gauss (1801)]] on definite ternary quadratic forms and [[#Hermite|Hermite (1853)]] on indefinite ternary quadratic forms, [[Eduard Selling]] (1873) used the auxiliary coefficients ξ,η,ζ by which a definite form &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{f}&lt;/math&gt; and an indefinite form ''f'' can be rewritten in terms of three squares:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Selling (1873), p. 174 and p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bachmann (1923), chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Selling showed that auxiliary coefficients ξηζ can be geometrically interpreted as point coordinates which are in motion upon one sheet of a two-sheet hyperboloid, which is related to Selling's formalism for the reduction of indefinite forms by using definite forms.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Selling (1873), pp. 182–183&lt;/ref&gt;

Selling also reproduced the Lorentz transformation given by [[#Gauss3|Gauss (1800/63)]], to whom he gave full credit, and called it the only example of a particular indefinite ternary form known to him that has ever been discussed:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Selling (1873/74), p. 227 (see also p. 225 for citation).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wilhelm Killing]] (1878–1880) described non-Euclidean geometry by using [[hyperboloid model|Weierstrass coordinates]] (named after [[Karl Weierstrass]] who described them in lectures in 1872 which Killing attended) obeying the form

:&lt;math&gt;k^{2}t^{2}+u^{2}+v^{2}+w^{2}=k^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group=M&gt;Killing (1877/78), p. 74; Killing (1880), p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; with &lt;math&gt;ds^{2}=k^{2}dt^{2}+du^{2}+dv^{2}+dw^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref group=M&gt;Killing (1880), eq. 25 on p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''k'' is the reciprocal measure of curvature, ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=∞ denotes [[Euclidean geometry]], ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;0 [[elliptic geometry]], and ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;0 hyperbolic geometry. In (1877/78) he pointed out the possibility and some characteristics of a transformation (indicating rigid motions) preserving the above form.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Killing (1877/78), eq. 25 on p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; In (1879/80) he wrote the corresponding transformations as a [[Rotation matrix#Rotation matrix from axis and angle|general rotation matrix]]&lt;ref group=M&gt;Killing (1879/80), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

and in (1892) he defined the infinitesimal transformation for non-Euclidean motions in terms of Weierstrass coordinates:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Killing (1892), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of translation was also given by him, where the ''y''-axis remains unchanged:&lt;ref group=M name=cox&gt;Cox (1881/82), p. 194&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor|Cox2}} Quaternions====

Subsequently, Cox (1882/83) also described hyperbolic geometry in terms of an analogue to [[quaternion]]s and [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s [[exterior algebra]]. To that end, he used [[hyperbolic number]]s, which were first introduced by [[James Cockle]] (1848) in the framework of his [[tessarine]] algebra as follows:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cockle (1848), p. 438&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{jy}=1+jy+\frac{y^{2}}{2}+j\frac{y^{3}}{2.3}+\frac{y^{4}}{2.3.4}+\&amp;c.,\ \left(j^{2}=1\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the hands of Cox (who doesn't mention Cockle) this expression becomes a means to transfer point P to point Q in the hyperbolic plane, which he wrote in the form:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cox (1882/83a), pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}QP^{-1}=\cosh\theta+\iota\sinh\theta\\
QP^{-1}=e^{\iota\theta}
\end{matrix}\left(\iota^{2}=1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

In (1882/83a) he showed the equivalence of ''PQ''=-cosh(θ)+ι·sinh(θ) with "quaternion multiplication",&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cox (1882/83a), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; and in (1882/83b) he described ''QP''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;=cosh(θ)+ι·sinh(θ) as being "associative quaternion multiplication".&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cox (1882/83b), p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; He also showed that the position of point P in the hyperbolic plane may be determined by three quantities in terms of Weierstrass coordinates obeying the relation ''z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1''.&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cox (1882/83a), p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Equation box 1|border colour = black |background colour=white|equation=Cox's associative quaternion multiplication using the hyperbolic versor is equivalent to the Lorentz boost ({{equationNote|7b}}) by setting &lt;math&gt;Q=x_{1}^{\prime}+\iota x_{0}^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P=x_{1}+\iota x_{0}&lt;/math&gt;.}}

Cox went on to develop an algebra for hyperbolic space analogous to Clifford's [[biquaternion]]s. While Clifford (1873) used biquaternions of the form ''a+ωb'' in which ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0 denotes parabolic space and ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=1 elliptic space, Cox discussed hyperbolic space using the imaginary quantity &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and therefore ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1.&lt;ref group=M&gt;On pp. 104-105 he started using the term v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1, on p. 106 he noted that one can simply use &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; instead of ''v'', and on p. 112 he adopted Clifford's notation by setting ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He also obtained relations of quaternion multiplication in terms of Weierstrass coordinates:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Cox (1882/83a), pp. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}w^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}-z^{2}=1\\

It can be seen as a special case of the conformal group in terms of [[#Lie|Lie's transformations of oriented spheres]]. In two dimensions the transformation or oriented lines has the form (''R'' being the radius):&lt;ref group=M name=laguerre&gt;Laguerre (1882), pp. 550–551.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cyparissos Stephanos]] (1883)&lt;ref group=M&gt;Stephanos (1883), p. 590ff&lt;/ref&gt; showed that Hamilton's biquaternion ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be interpreted as an oriented sphere in terms of [[#Lie|Lie's sphere geometry (1871)]], having the vector ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;ι&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' as its center and the scalar &lt;math&gt;a_{0}\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; as its radius. Its norm &lt;math&gt;a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+a_{3}^{2}+a_{4}^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is thus equal to the power of a point of the corresponding sphere. In particular, the norm of two quaternions ''N(Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)'' (the corresponding spheres are in contact with ''N(Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)=0'') is equal to the tangential distance between two spheres. The general contact transformation between two spheres then can be given by a [[homography]] using 4 arbitrary quaternions ''A,B,C,D'' and two variable quaternions ''X,Y'':&lt;ref group=M&gt;Stephanos (1883), p. 592&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cartan &amp; Study (1908), p. 460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rothe (1916), p. 1399&lt;/ref&gt;

He derived the following relations consistent with the Cayley–Klein absolute:&lt;ref group=M&gt;Buchheim (1885), p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Woldemar Voigt]] (1887)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Voigt (1887), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; developed a transformation in connection with the [[Doppler effect]] and an incompressible medium, being in modern notation:&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1981), 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pais&gt;Pais (1982), Kap. 6b&lt;/ref&gt;

\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

If the right-hand sides of his equations are multiplied by γ they are the modern Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}). In Voigt's theory the speed of light is invariant, but his transformations mix up a relativistic boost together with a rescaling of space-time. Optical phenomena in free space are [[Scale invariance|scale]], [[Conformal map|conformal]] (using the factor λ discussed [[#Lorentz transformation via spherical wave transformation|above]]), and [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]], so the combination is invariant too.&lt;ref name=pais /&gt; For instance, Lorentz transformations can be extended by using &lt;math&gt;l=\sqrt{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1915/16), p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x^{\prime}=\gamma l\left(x-vt\right),\quad y^{\prime}=ly,\quad z^{\prime}=lz,\quad t^{\prime}=\gamma l\left(t-x\frac{v}{c^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

''l''=1/γ gives the Voigt transformation, ''l''=1 the Lorentz transformation. But scale transformations are not a symmetry of all the laws of nature, only of electromagnetism, so these transformations cannot be used to formulate a [[principle of relativity]] in general. It was demonstrated by Poincaré and Einstein that one has to set ''l''=1 in order to make the above transformation symmetric and to form a group as required by the relativity principle, therefore the Lorentz transformation is the only viable choice.

Voigt sent his 1887 paper to Lorentz in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Voigt's transformations and the beginning of the relativistic revolution, Ricardo Heras, arXiv:1411.2559 [https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2559]&lt;/ref&gt; and that was acknowledged in 1909: {{Quote|In a paper „Über das Doppler'sche Princip", published in 1887 (Gött. Nachrichten, p. 41) and which to my regret has escaped my notice all these years, Voigt has applied to equations of the form (7) (§ 3 of this book) [namely &lt;math&gt;\Delta\Psi-\tfrac{1}{c^{2}}\tfrac{\partial^{2}\Psi}{\partial t^{2}}=0&lt;/math&gt;] a transformation equivalent to the formulae (287) and (288) [namely &lt;math&gt;x^{\prime}=\gamma l\left(x-vt\right),\ y^{\prime}=ly,\ z^{\prime}=lz,\ t^{\prime}=\gamma l\left(t-\tfrac{v}{c^{2}}x\right)&lt;/math&gt;]. The idea of the transformations used above (and in § 44) might therefore have been borrowed from Voigt and the proof that it does not alter the form of the equations for the ''free'' ether is contained in his paper.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1915/16), p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Also [[Hermann Minkowski]] said in 1908 that the transformations which play the main role in the principle of relativity were first examined by Voigt in 1887. Voigt responded in the same paper by saying that his theory was based on an elastic theory of light, not an electromagnetic one. However, he concluded that some results were actually the same.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Bucherer (1908), p. 762&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Heaviside}} Heaviside (1888), Thomson (1889), Searle (1896)===

In 1888, [[Oliver Heaviside]]&lt;ref group=R&gt;Heaviside (1888), p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; investigated the properties of [[Relativistic electromagnetism|charges in motion]] according to Maxwell's electrodynamics. He calculated, among other things, anisotropies in the electric field of moving bodies represented by this formula:&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{E}=\left(\frac{q\mathrm{r}}{r^{2}}\right)\left(1-\frac{v^{2}\sin^{2}\theta}{c^{2}}\right)^{-3/2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Consequently, [[Joseph John Thomson]] (1889)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Thomson (1889), p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; found a way to substantially simplify calculations concerning moving charges by using the following mathematical transformation (like other authors such as Lorentz or Larmor, also Thomson implicitly used the [[Galilean transformation]] ''z-vt'' in his equation&lt;ref name=mil /&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\

=== {{anchor|Lorentz1}} Lorentz (1892, 1895) ===

In order to explain the [[aberration of light]] and the result of the [[Fizeau experiment]] in accordance with [[Maxwell's equations]], Lorentz in 1892 developed a model ("[[Lorentz ether theory]]") in which the aether is completely motionless, and the speed of light in the aether is constant in all directions. In order to calculate the optics of moving bodies, Lorentz introduced the following quantities to transform from the aether system into a moving system (it's unknown whether he was influenced by Voigt, Heaviside, and Thomson)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1892a), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=milf&gt;Miller (1982), 1.4 &amp; 1.5&lt;/ref&gt;

\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[Galilean transformation]] ''x-vt''. Except the additional γ in the time transformation, this is the complete Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}).&lt;ref name=milf /&gt; While ''t'' is the "true" time for observers resting in the aether, ''t′'' is an auxiliary variable only for calculating processes for moving systems. It is also important that Lorentz and later also Larmor formulated this transformation in two steps. At first an implicit Galilean transformation, and later the expansion into the "fictitious" electromagnetic system with the aid of the Lorentz transformation. In order to explain the negative result of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], he (1892b)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1892b), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the additional hypothesis that also intermolecular forces are affected in a similar way and introduced [[length contraction]] in his theory (without proof as he admitted). The same hypothesis was already made by [[George FitzGerald]] in 1889 based on Heaviside's work. While length contraction was a real physical effect for Lorentz, he considered the time transformation only as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical stipulation.

In 1895, Lorentz further elaborated on his theory and introduced the "theorem of corresponding states". This theorem states that a moving observer (relative to the ether) in his „fictitious" field makes the same observations as a resting observers in his „real" field for velocities to first order in ''v/c''. Lorentz showed that the dimensions of electrostatic systems in the ether and a moving frame are connected by this transformation:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1895), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

For solving optical problems Lorentz used the following transformation, in which the modified time variable was called "local time" ({{lang-de|Ortszeit}}) by him:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1895), p. 49 for local time and p. 56 for spatial coordinates.&lt;/ref&gt;

\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

With this concept Lorentz could explain the [[Doppler effect]], the [[aberration of light]], and the [[Fizeau experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;Janssen (1995), 3.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Larmor}} Larmor (1897, 1900) ===

In 1897, Larmor extended the work of Lorentz and derived the following transformation&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1897), p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Larmor noted that if it is assumed that the constitution of molecules is electrical then the FitzGerald–Lorentz contraction is a consequence of this transformation, explaining the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]. It's notable that Larmor was the first who recognized that some sort of [[time dilation]] is a consequence of this transformation as well, because "individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [rest] system in the ratio 1/γ".&lt;ref&gt;Darrigol (2000), Chap. 8.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macrossan (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Larmor wrote his electrodynamical equations and transformations neglecting terms of higher order than ''(v/c)''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; – when his 1897 paper was reprinted in 1929, Larmor added the following comment in which he described how they can be made valid to all orders of ''v/c'':&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1897/1929), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Nothing need be neglected: the transformation is ''exact'' if ''(v/c)''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is replaced by ''εv/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the equations and also in the change following from ''t'' to ''t′'', as is worked out in ''Aether and Matter'' (1900), p. 168, and as Lorentz found it to be in 1904, thereby stimulating the modern schemes of intrinsic relational relativity.}}

In line with that comment, in his book Aether and Matter published in 1900, Larmor used a modified local time ''t″=t′-εvx′/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' instead of the 1897 expression ''t′=t-vx/c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' by replacing ''v/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''εv/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so that ''t″'' is now identical to the one given by Lorentz in 1892, which he combined with a Galilean transformation for the ''x′, y′, z′, t′'' coordinates:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1900), p. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\

y^{\prime} &amp; =y\\

\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Larmor knew that the Michelson–Morley experiment was accurate enough to detect an effect of motion depending on the factor ''(v/c)''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and so he sought the transformations which were "accurate to second order" (as he put it). Thus he wrote the final transformations (where ''x′=x-vt'' and ''t″'' as given above) as:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1900), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\

by which he arrived at the complete Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}). Larmor showed that Maxwell's equations were invariant under this two-step transformation, "to second order in ''v/c''" – it was later shown by Lorentz (1904) and Poincaré (1905) that they are indeed invariant under this transformation to all orders in ''v/c''.

Larmor gave credit to Lorentz in two papers published in 1904, in which he used the term "Lorentz transformation" for Lorentz's first order transformations of coordinates and field configurations:

{{Quote|p. 583: [..] Lorentz's transformation for passing from the field of activity of a stationary electrodynamic material system to that of one moving with uniform velocity of translation through the aether.&lt;br /&gt; p. 585: [..] the Lorentz transformation has shown us what is not so immediately obvious [..]&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1904a), p. 583, 585&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; p. 622: [..] the transformation first developed by Lorentz: namely, each point in space is to have its own origin from which time is measured, its "local time" in Lorentz's phraseology, and then the values of the electric and magnetic vectors [..] at all points in the aether between the molecules in the system at rest, are the same as those of the vectors [..] at the corresponding points in the convected system at the same local times.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Larmor (1904b), p. 622&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== {{anchor|Lorentz2}} Lorentz (1899, 1904) ===

Also Lorentz extended his theorem of corresponding states in 1899. First he wrote a transformation equivalent to the one from 1892 (again, ''x''* must be replaced by ''x-vt''):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1899), p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\

t^{\prime} &amp; =t-\frac{\gamma^{2}vx^{\ast}}{c^{2}}=\gamma^{2}\left(t-\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\right)
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Then he introduced a factor &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; of which he said he has no means of determining it, and modified his transformation as follows (where the above value of ''t′'' has to be inserted):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1899), p. 439&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\

\right| &amp; \begin{align}x^{\ast}=x-vt &amp; =\frac{\varepsilon}{\gamma}x^{\prime\prime}\\

\gamma &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the complete Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}) when solved for ''x″'' and ''t″'' and with ε=1. Like Larmor, Lorentz noticed in 1899&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1899), p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; also some sort of time dilation effect in relation to the frequency of oscillating electrons "''that in ''S'' the time of vibrations be ''kε'' times as great as in ''S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''", where ''S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the aether frame.&lt;ref&gt;Jannsen (1995), Kap. 3.3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 he rewrote the equations in the following form by setting ''l''=1/ε (again, ''x''* must be replaced by ''x-vt''):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1904), p. 812&lt;/ref&gt;

\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Under the assumption that ''l=1'' when ''v''=0, he demonstrated that ''l=1'' must be the case at all velocities, therefore length contraction can only arise in the line of motion. So by setting the factor ''l'' to unity, Lorentz's transformations now assumed the same form as Larmor's and are now completed. Unlike Larmor, who restricted himself to show the covariance of Maxwell's equations to second order, Lorentz tried to widen its covariance to all orders in ''v/c''. He also derived the correct formulas for the velocity dependence of [[electromagnetic mass]], and concluded that the transformation formulas must apply to all forces of nature, not only electrical ones.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Lorentz (1904), p. 826&lt;/ref&gt; However, he didn't achieve full covariance of the transformation equations for charge density and velocity.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1981), Chap. 1.12.2&lt;/ref&gt; When the 1904 paper was reprinted in 1913, Lorentz therefore added the following remark:&lt;ref&gt;Jannsen (1995), Chap. 3.5.6&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zitat|One will notice that in this work the transformation equations of Einstein’s Relativity Theory have not quite been attained. [..] On this circumstance depends the clumsiness of many of the further considerations in this work.}}

==== Local time ====

Neither Lorentz or Larmor gave a clear physical interpretation of the origin of local time. However, [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1900 commented on the origin of Lorentz’s "wonderful invention" of local time.&lt;ref&gt;Darrigol (2005), Kap. 4&lt;/ref&gt; He remarked that it arose when clocks in a moving reference frame are synchronised by exchanging signals which are assumed to travel with the same speed &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; in both directions, which lead to what is nowadays called [[relativity of simultaneity]], although Poincaré's calculation does not involve length contraction or time dilation.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Poincaré (1900), pp. 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; In order to synchronise the clocks here on Earth (the ''x*, t''* frame) a light signal from one clock (at the origin) is sent to another (at ''x''*), and is sent back. It's supposed that the Earth is moving with speed ''v'' in the ''x''-direction (= ''x''*-direction) in some rest system (''x, t'') (''i.e.'' the [[luminiferous aether]] system for Lorentz and Larmor). The time of flight outwards is

:&lt;math&gt;\delta t_{o}=\frac{x^{\ast}}{\left(c-v\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

and the time of flight back is

:&lt;math&gt;\delta t_{b}=\frac{x^{\ast}}{\left(c+v\right)}&lt;/math&gt;.

The elapsed time on the clock when the signal is returned is &lt;math&gt;\delta t_{o}+\delta t_{b}&lt;/math&gt; and the time &lt;math&gt;t^{\ast}=\left(\delta t_{o}+\delta t_{b}\right)/2&lt;/math&gt; is ascribed to the moment when the light signal reached the distant clock. In the rest frame the time &lt;math&gt;t=\delta t_{o}&lt;/math&gt; is ascribed to that same instant. Some algebra gives the relation between the different time coordinates ascribed to the moment of reflection. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;t^{\ast}=t-\frac{\gamma^{2}vx^{*}}{c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

identical to Lorentz (1892). By dropping the factor γ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; under the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}\ll1&lt;/math&gt;, Poincaré gave the result &lt;math&gt;t^{\ast}=t-vx^{\ast}/c^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is the form used by Lorentz in 1895.

Similar physical interpretations of local time were later given by [[Emil Cohn]] (1904)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Cohn (1904b), p. 1408&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Abraham]] (1905).&lt;ref group=R&gt;Abraham (1905), § 42&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lorentz transformation ====

On June 5, 1905 (published June 9) Poincaré simplified the equations which are algebraically equivalent to those of Larmor and Lorentz and gave them the modern form ({{equationNote|4b}}):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Poincaré (1905), p. 1505&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x^{\prime} &amp; =kl(x+\varepsilon t)\\
y^{\prime} &amp; =ly\\
z^{\prime} &amp; =lz\\
t' &amp; =kl(t+\varepsilon x)\\
k &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^{2}}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

Apparently Poincaré was unaware of Larmor's contributions, because he only mentioned Lorentz and therefore used for the first time the name "Lorentz transformation".&lt;ref&gt;Pais (1982), Chap. 6c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katzir (2005), 280–288&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré set the speed of light to unity, pointed out the group characteristics of the transformation by setting ''l''=1, and modified/corrected Lorentz's derivation of the equations of electrodynamics in some details in order to fully satisfy the principle of relativity, ''i.e.'' making them fully Lorentz covariant.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1981), Chap. 1.14&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1905 (published in January 1906)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Poincaré (1905/06), pp. 129ff&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré showed in detail how the transformations and electrodynamic equations are a consequence of the [[principle of least action]]; he demonstrated in more detail the group characteristics of the transformation, which he called [[Lorentz group]], and he showed that the combination &lt;math&gt;x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}-c^{2}t^{2}&lt;/math&gt; is invariant. He noticed that the Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing &lt;math&gt;ct\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; as a fourth imaginary coordinate, and he used an early form of [[four-vector]]s.

==={{anchor|Einstein}} Einstein (1905) – Special relativity===

On June 30, 1905 (published September 1905) Einstein published what is now called [[special relativity]] and gave a new derivation of the transformation, which was based only on the principle on relativity and the principle of the constancy of the speed of light. While Lorentz considered "local time" to be a mathematical stipulation device for explaining the Michelson-Morley experiment, Einstein showed that the coordinates given by the Lorentz transformation were in fact the inertial coordinates of relatively moving frames of reference. For quantities of first order in ''v/c'' this was also done by Poincaré in 1900, while Einstein derived the complete transformation by this method. Unlike Lorentz and Poincaré who still distinguished between real time in the aether and apparent time for moving observers, Einstein showed that the transformations concern the nature of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1981), Chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pais (1982), Kap. 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darrigol (2005), Chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The notation for this transformation is equivalent to Poincaré's of 1905 and ({{equationNote|4b}}), except that Einstein didn't set the speed of light to unity:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Einstein (1905), p. 902&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\tau &amp; =\beta\left(t-\frac{v}{V^{2}}x\right)\\
\xi &amp; =\beta(x-vt)\\
\eta &amp; =y\\
\zeta &amp; =z\\
\beta &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{V}\right)^{2}}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Einstein also defined the velocity addition formula ({{equationNote|4c}}) (which also has been done by Poincaré in May 1905 in unpublished letters to Lorentz):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Einstein (1905), § 5&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}x=\frac{w_{\xi}+v}{1+\frac{vw_{\xi}}{V^{2}}}t,\ y=\frac{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{V}\right)^{2}}}{1+\frac{vw_{\xi}}{V^{2}}}w_{\eta}t\\
U^{2}=\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^{2},\ w^{2}=w_{\xi}^{2}+w_{\eta}^{2},\ \alpha=\operatorname{arctg}\frac{w_{y}}{w_{x}}\\
U=\frac{\sqrt{\left(v^{2}+w^{2}+2vw\cos\alpha\right)-\left(\frac{vw\sin\alpha}{V}\right)^{2}}}{1+\frac{vw\cos\alpha}{V^{2}}}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

=== {{anchor|Minkowski}} Minkowski (1907–1908) – Spacetime ===

The work on the principle of relativity by Lorentz, Einstein, [[Max Planck|Planck]], together with Poincaré's four-dimensional approach, were further elaborated and combined with the [[hyperboloid model]] by [[Hermann Minkowski]] in 1907 and 1908.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Minkowski (1907/15), pp. 927ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=R&gt;Minkowski (1907/08), pp. 53ff&lt;/ref&gt; Minkowski particularly reformulated electrodynamics in a four-dimensional way ([[Minkowski spacetime]]).&lt;ref&gt;Walter (1999a)&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he wrote ''x, y, z, it'' in the form ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, x&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''. By defining &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; as the angle of rotation around the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, the Lorentz transformation assumes a form (with ''c''=1) in agreement with ({{equationNote|2b}}):&lt;ref group=R name=mink1&gt;Minkowski (1907/08), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}x'_{1} &amp; =x_{1}\\
x'_{2} &amp; =x_{2}\\
x'_{3} &amp; =x_{3}\cos i\psi+x_{4}\sin i\psi\\
x'_{4} &amp; =-x_{3}\sin i\psi+x_{4}\cos i\psi\\
\cos i\psi &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^{2}}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Even though Minkowski used the imaginary number iψ, he for once&lt;ref group=R name=mink1 /&gt; directly used the [[tangens hyperbolicus]] in the equation for velocity

:&lt;math&gt;-i\tan i\psi=\frac{e^{\psi}-e^{-\psi}}{e^{\psi}+e^{-\psi}}=q&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\psi=\frac{1}{2}\ln\frac{1+q}{1-q}&lt;/math&gt;.

Minkowski's expression can also by written as ψ=atanh(q) and was later called [[rapidity]]. He also wrote the Lorentz transformation in matrix form equivalent to ({{equationNote|2a}}) &lt;math&gt;(n=3)&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Minkowski (1907/08), pp. 65–66, 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

As a graphical representation of the Lorentz transformation he introduced the [[Minkowski diagram]], which became a standard tool in textbooks and research articles on relativity:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Minkowski (1908/09), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Bateman}} Bateman and Cunningham (1909–1910) – Spherical wave transformation===

In line with [[#Lie|Lie's (1871)]] research on the relation between sphere transformations with an imaginary radius coordinate and 4D conformal transformations, it was pointed out by [[Harry Bateman|Bateman]] and [[Ebenezer Cunningham|Cunningham]] (1909–1910), that by setting ''u=ict'' as the imaginary fourth coordinates one can produce spacetime conformal transformations. Not only the quadratic form ''λ(δx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+δy&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+δz&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+δu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)'', but also [[Maxwells equations]] are covariant with respect to these transformations, irrespective of the choice of λ. These variants of conformal or Lie sphere transformations were called [[spherical wave transformation]]s by Bateman.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Bateman (1909/10), pp. 223ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=R&gt;Cunningham (1909/10), pp. 77ff&lt;/ref&gt; However, this covariance is restricted to certain areas such as electrodynamics, whereas the totality of natural laws in inertial frames is covariant under the [[Lorentz group]].&lt;ref group=R&gt;Klein (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, by setting λ=1 the Lorentz group {{nowrap|SO(3,1)}} can be seen as a 10-parameter subgroup of the 15-parameter spacetime conformal group {{nowrap|Con(3,1)}}.

Bateman (1910/12)&lt;ref&gt;Bateman (1910/12), pp. 358–359&lt;/ref&gt; also alluded to the identity between the [[#Laguerre|Laguerre inversion]] and the Lorentz transformations. In general, the isomorphism between the Laguerre group and the Lorentz group was pointed out by [[Élie Cartan]] (1912, 1915/55),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref group=R&gt;Cartan (1912), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Poincaré]] (1912/21)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Poincaré (1912/21), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

=== {{anchor|Herglotz1}} Herglotz (1909/10) – Möbius transformation ===

Following [[#Klein2|Klein (1889–1897) and Fricke &amp; Klein (1897)]] concerning the Cayley absolute, hyperbolic motion and its transformation, [[Gustav Herglotz]] (1909/10) classified the one-parameter Lorentz transformations as loxodromic, hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptic. The general case (on the left) equivalent to Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|6a}}) and the hyperbolic case (on the right) equivalent to Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|3c}}) are as follows:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Herglotz (1909/10), pp. 404-408&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left.\begin{matrix}z_{1}^{2}+z_{2}^{2}+z_{3}^{2}-z_{4}^{2}=0\\
z_{1}=x,\ z_{2}=y,\ z_{3}=z,\ z_{4}=t\\
Z=\frac{z_{1}+iz_{2}}{z_{4}-z_{3}}=\frac{x+iy}{t-z},\ Z'=\frac{x'+iy'}{t'-z'}\\
Z=\frac{\alpha Z'+\beta}{\gamma Z'+\delta}
\end{matrix}\right|\begin{matrix}Z=Z'e^{\vartheta}\\
\begin{align}x &amp; =x', &amp; t-z &amp; =(t'-z')e^{\vartheta}\\
y &amp; =y', &amp; t+z &amp; =(t'+z')e^{-\vartheta}
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==={{anchor|Varicak}} Varićak (1910) – Weierstrass coordinates===

Following [[#Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld (1909)]], hyperbolic functions were used by [[Vladimir Varićak]] in several papers starting from 1910, who represented the equations of special relativity on the basis of [[hyperbolic geometry]] in terms of Weierstrass coordinates. For instance, by setting ''l=ct'' and ''v/c=tanh(u)'' with ''u'' as rapidity he wrote the Lorentz transformation in agreement with ({{equationNote|3b}}):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Varićak (1910), p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}l' &amp; =-x\sinh u+l\cosh u,\\
x' &amp; =x\cosh u-l\sinh u,\\
y' &amp; =y,\quad z'=z,\\
\cosh u &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v}{c}\right)^{2}}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Varićak also related the velocity addition to the [[hyperbolic law of cosines]]:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Varićak (1910), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\operatorname{ch}{u}=\operatorname{ch}{u_{1}}\operatorname ch{u_{2}}+\operatorname{sh}{u_{1}}\operatorname{sh}{u_{2}}\cos\alpha\\
\operatorname{ch}{u_{i}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v_{i}}{c}\right)^{2}}},\ \operatorname{sh}{u_{i}}=\frac{v_{i}}{\sqrt{1-\left(\frac{v_{i}}{c}\right)^{2}}}\\
v=\sqrt{v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}-\left(\frac{v_{1}v_{2}}{c}\right)^{2}}\ \left(a=\frac{\pi}{2}\right)
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Subsequently, other authors such as [[E. T. Whittaker]] (1910) or [[Alfred Robb]] (1911, who coined the name rapidity) used similar expressions, which are still used in modern textbooks.&lt;ref name=rind /&gt;

=== {{anchor|Ignatowski}} Ignatowski (1910) ===

While earlier derivations and formulations of the Lorentz transformation relied from the outset on optics, electrodynamics, or the invariance of the speed of light, [[Vladimir Ignatowski]] (1910) showed that it is possible to use the principle of relativity (and related [[Group theory|group theoretical]] principles) alone, in order to derive the following transformation between two inertial frames:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Ignatowski (1910), pp. 973–974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=R&gt;Ignatowski (1910/11), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}dx' &amp; =p\ dx-pq\ dt\\
dt' &amp; =-pqn\ dx+p\ dt\\
p &amp; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-q^{2}n}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The variable ''n'' can be seen as a space-time constant whose value has to be determined by experiment or taken from a known physical law such as electrodynamics. For that purpose, Ignatowski used the above-mentioned Heaviside ellipsoid representing a contraction of electrostatic fields by ''x''/γ in the direction of motion. It can be seen that this is only consistent with Ignatowski's transformation when ''n=1/c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in ''p''=γ and the Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}). With ''n''=0, no length changes arise and the Galilean transformation follows. Ignatowski's method was further developed and improved by [[Philipp Frank]] and [[Hermann Rothe]] (1911, 1912),&lt;ref group=R&gt;Frank &amp; Rothe (1911), pp. 825ff; (1912), p. 750ff.&lt;/ref&gt; with various authors developing similar methods in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=baccetti&gt;Baccetti (2011), see references 1–25 therein.&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Noether}} Noether (1910), Klein (1910), Conway (1911), Silberstein (1911) – Quaternions===

In an appedix to Klein's and Sommerfeld's "Theory of the top" (1910), [[Fritz Noether]] showed how to formulate hyperbolic rotations using biquaternions with &lt;math&gt;\omega=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which he also related to the speed of light by setting ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=-''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. He concluded that this is the principal ingredient for a rational representation of the group of Lorentz transformations equivalent to ({{equationNote|7a}}):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Noether (1910), pp. 939–943&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}V=\frac{Q_{1}vQ_{2}}{T_{1}T_{2}}\\

\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Besides citing quaternion related standard works such as [[#Cayley3|Cayley (1854)]], Noether referred to the entries in Klein's encyclopedia by [[Eduard Study]] (1899) and the French version by [[Élie Cartan]] (1908).&lt;ref&gt;Cartan &amp; Study (1908), sections 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; Cartan's version contains a description of Study's [[dual number]]s, Clifford's biquaternions (including the choice &lt;math&gt;\omega=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; for hyperbolic geometry), and Clifford algebra, with references to [[#Stephanos|Stephanos (1883)]], [[#Buchheim|Buchheim (1884/85)]], [[#Vahlen|Vahlen (1901/02)]] and others.

Already in 1908, while describing "Drehstreckungen" (orthogonal substitutions in terms of rotations leaving invariant a quadratic form up to a factor) by using [[#Cayley3|Cayley's (1854)]] quaternion multiplication formalism, [[Felix Klein]] pointed out that the modern principle of relativity as provided by Minkowski is essentially only the consequent application of such Drehstreckungen, even though he didn't provide details.&lt;ref group=R&gt;Klein (1908), p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Noether, in August 1910 Klein published the following quaternion substitutions forming the group of Lorentz transformations:&lt;ref group=R&gt;Klein (1910), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

Also [[Ludwik Silberstein]] in November 1911&lt;ref group=R&gt;Silberstein (1911/12), p. 793&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in 1914,&lt;ref&gt;Silberstein (1914), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded in combining quaternions and relativity

==={{anchor|Herglotz2}} Herglotz (1911), Silberstein (1911) – Vector transformation===

{{See|Lorentz transformation#Vector transformations}}

[[Gustav Herglotz]] (1911)&lt;ref group=R&gt;Herglotz (1911), p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; showed how to formulate the transformation equivalent to ({{equationNote|4e}}) in order to allow for arbitrary velocities and coordinates &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=\left(v_{x},\ v_{y},\ v_{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}=\left(x,\ y,\ z\right)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\text{original} &amp; \text{modern}\\
\hline \left.\begin{align}x^{0} &amp; =x+\alpha u(ux+vy+wz)-\beta ut\\
y^{0} &amp; =y+\alpha v(ux+vy+wz)-\beta vt\\
z^{0} &amp; =z+\alpha w(ux+vy+wz)-\beta wt\\
t^{0} &amp; =-\beta(ux+vy+wz)+\beta t\\
 &amp; \alpha=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-s^{2}}\left(1+\sqrt{1-s^{2}}\right)},\ \beta=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-s^{2}}}

 &amp; \alpha=\frac{\gamma^{2}}{\gamma+1},\ \gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}}}
\end{align}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

This was simplified using vector notation by [[Ludwik Silberstein]] (1911 on the left, 1914 on the right):&lt;ref group=R&gt;Silberstein (1911/12), p. 792; (1914), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

t' &amp; =\gamma\left[t-\frac{1}{c^{2}}(\mathbf{vr})\right]
\end{align}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalent formulas were also given by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] (1921),&lt;ref&gt;Pauli (1921), p. 555&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Erwin Madelung]] (1922) providing the matrix form&lt;ref&gt;Madelung (1921), p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

These formulas were called "general Lorentz transformation without rotation" by [[Christian Møller]] (1952),&lt;ref&gt;Møller (1952/55), pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt; who in addition gave an even more general Lorentz transformation in which the Cartesian axes have different orientations, using a [[Three-dimensional rotation operator|rotation operator]] &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{D}&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'=\left(v_{x}^{\prime},\ v_{y}^{\prime},\ v_{z}^{\prime}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to &lt;math&gt;-\mathbf{v}=\left(-v_{x},\ -v_{y},\ -v_{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;, but the relation &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}'=-\mathfrak{D}\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; holds instead, with the result

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
\begin{align}\mathbf{x}' &amp; =\mathfrak{D}^{-1}\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{v}'\left\{ \left(\gamma-1\right)(\mathbf{x\cdot v})/v^{2}-\gamma t\right\} \\
t' &amp; =\gamma\left(t-(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{x})/c^{2}\right)
\end{align}
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

==Euler's gap==
In pursuing the history in years before Lorentz enunciated his expressions, one looks to the essence of the concept. In mathematical terms, Lorentz transformations are [[squeeze mapping]]s, the linear transformations that turn a square into a rectangles of the same area. Before Euler, the squeezing was studied as [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent|quadrature of the hyperbola]] and led to the [[hyperbolic sector|hyperbolic logarithm]]. In 1748 Euler issued his [[precalculus]] [[textbook]] where the number [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] is exploited for trigonometry in the [[unit circle]]. The first volume of [[Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite]] had no diagrams, allowing teachers and students to draw their own illustrations.

There is a gap in Euler's text where Lorentz transformations arise. A feature of [[natural logarithm]] is its interpretation as area in [[hyperbolic sector]]s. In relativity the classical concept of [[velocity]] is replaced with [[rapidity]], a [[hyperbolic angle]] concept built on hyperbolic sectors. A Lorentz transformation is a [[hyperbolic rotation]] which preserves differences of rapidity, just as the [[circular sector]] area is preserved with a circular rotation. Euler’s gap is the lack of hyperbolic angle and [[hyperbolic function]]s, later developed by [[Johann H. Lambert]]. Euler described some [[transcendental function]]s: exponetiation and [[circular function]]s. He used the exponential series &lt;math&gt;\sum_0^{\infty} x^n /n! .&lt;/math&gt; With the [[imaginary unit]] i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = – 1, and splitting the series into even and odd terms, he obtained
:&lt;math&gt;e^{ix} = \sum_0^{\infty} (ix)^{2n}/(2n)! \ + \ \sum_0^{\infty} (ix)^{2n+1}/(2n + 1)! =&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \sum_0^{\infty} (-1)^n x^{2n} / 2n! + i \sum_0^{\infty} (-1)^n x^{2n+1}/(2n+1)! \ = \ \cos x + i \sin x .&lt;/math&gt;
This development misses the alternative:
:&lt;math&gt;e^x = \cosh x + \sinh x&lt;/math&gt; (even and odd terms), and
:&lt;math&gt;e^{jx} = \cosh x + j \sinh x \quad (j^2 = +1) &lt;/math&gt; which parametrizes the [[unit hyperbola]].
Here Euler could have noted [[split-complex number]]s along with [[complex number]]s.

For physics, one space dimension is insufficient. But to extend split-complex arithmetic to four dimensions leads to [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s, and opens the door to [[abstract algebra]]’s 
[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Abstract_Algebra/Hypercomplex_numbers hypercomplex numbers]. Reviewing the expressions of Lorentz and Einstein, one observes that the [[Lorentz factor]] is an [[algebraic function]] of velocity. For readers uncomfortable with transcendental functions cosh and sinh, algebraic functions may be more to their liking.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4745">'''''Imagineering''''' is a [[portmanteau]] combining the words "imagination" and "engineering". Imagineering is the implementation of creative ideas in practical form.

The word is a [[Registered trademark symbol|registered trademark]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMAGINEERING - Trademark Details|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/738/03/imagineering-73803332.html|publisher=Justia Trademarks|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is well known for its use within the name of [[Walt Disney Imagineering]]; however, contrary to popular belief, the term was neither coined by Disney, nor did it originate there. The word was "invented" by [[Alcoa]] around 1940, and appeared widely in numerous publications of several disciplines such as urban design, geography and politics, evolutionary economics, corporate culture and futures studies.

==Earliest usages==
[[Image:Alcoa-time-02-16-1942-059.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Alcoa's 1942 advertisement of "The Place They Do Imagineering"]]During [[World War II]], [[Alcoa]] created an internal "Imagineering" program to encourage innovative usage of aluminum in order to keep up with demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aluminum Exhibits Its Versatility in Art, Life|last=Bykon|first=Maureen|date=November 2000|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0011/byko-0011.html|publisher=JOM}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine ad from February 16, 1942, titled "The Place They Do Imagineering" relates the origin:
{{blockquote|For a long time we've sought a word to describe what we all work at hard here at Alcoa... IMAGINEERING is the word... Imagineering is letting your imagination soar, and then engineering it down to earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Place They Do Imagineering|url=http://graphic-design.tjs-labs.com/show-picture?id=1118935951&amp;size=FULL|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=1942-02-16|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other notable pre-Disney usages include an October 24, 1942, mention in ''The New York Times'' in an article titled "Christian Imagineering," a 1944 [[Oxford English Dictionary]] entry which cites an advertisement from the ''Wall Street Journal'', and the use by artist [[Arthur Radebaugh]] to describe his work, which was mentioned in the article "Black Light Magic,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bp0.blogger.com/_sGYULzoQCgA/RkkUljB_-_I/AAAAAAAAAnQ/ZwsShB1vkjk/s1600-h/1947+May+2+Portsmouth+Times+-+Portsmouth+OH+imagineering.jpg|title=1947+May+2+Portsmouth+Times+-+Portsmouth+OH+imagineering.jpg (image)|website=bp0.blogger.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Portsmouth Times'', [[Portsmouth, Ohio]], 1947.

Other early usage includes Richard F. Sailer's 1957 article "BRAINSTORMING IS IMAGINation enginEERING"  written for the ''[[National Carbon Company]] Management Magazine'', and reprinted by the [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide Company]].

WED Enterprises applied for a trademark for the term in 1967, claiming first use in 1962.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 1981, a book with the title ''Imagineering for Health: Self-Healing Through the Use of the Mind'', authored by Serge King, was published by Quest Books ([[Wheaton, Illinois]]).&lt;!-- (listed among the references of ''Developing a 21st Century Mind'' by Marsha Sinetar, Villard Books, NY 1991) --&gt;

[[File:Color perception.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The human eye's red-to-green and blue-to-yellow values of each one-wavelength visible color]]

[[Image:Cones SMJ2 E.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Normalized [[spectral sensitivity]] curves of the three kinds of [[cone cell]]s, which define the space of human color [[sensation and perception|sensation]]]]
'''Impossible colors''' or '''forbidden colors''' are supposed colors that cannot be perceived in normal seeing of light that is a combination of various intensities of the various frequencies of visible light, but are reported to be seen in special circumstances.

==Types==
These impossible colors are of two types:
#Colors that would be seen if the output strengths of the human eye [[retina]]'s three types of [[cone cell]] (red, green, blue) could be set to values which cannot be produced by exposing the eye in normal seeing conditions to any possible combination of strengths of the frequencies of visible light.
#Colors that cannot be seen directly from any combination of retina signal output from one place in one eye, but can be generated in the brain's [[visual cortex]] by mixing color signals from the two eyes, or from more than one part of the same eye. Examples of these colors are yellowish-blue and reddish-green.&lt;ref name=Hewitt_1983/&gt; Those colors that appear to be similar to, for example, both red and green, or to both yellow and blue. (This does not mean the result of mixing paints of those two colors in painting, or the result of mixing lights of those two colors on a screen.)

==Opponent process==
{{Main|Opponent process}}
The color opponent process is a color theory that states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cone and rod cells in an antagonistic manner. The three types of [[cone cell]]s have some overlap in the wavelengths of light to which they respond, so it is more efficient for the visual system to record differences between the responses of cones, rather than each type of cone's individual response. The opponent color theory suggests that there are three opponent channels:
* Red versus green.
* Blue versus yellow
* Black versus white (this is achromatic and detects light-dark variation, or luminance).
Responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those to the other color, and signals output from a place on the retina can contain one or the other but not both, for each opponent pair.

==Real colors==
{{multiple image |align= right |direction= horizontal |total_width= 440 |caption_align= left |image1= CIExy1931.png |width1= 542 |height1= 599 |caption1= The [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931]] color space [[chromaticity]] diagram. The white regions outside the black line correspond to imaginary colors. (Note that the colors in this figure do not reproduce the actual colors in the diagram, due to the [[sRGB color space|limitations of RGB computer displays]]) |image2= CIExy1931 ProPhoto.svg | width2= 476 |height2= 540 |caption2= The [[ProPhoto RGB color space]] uses imaginary green and blue primaries to obtain a larger gamut (space inside the triangle) than would be possible with three real primaries. However, some real colors are still irreproducible.}}
Real colors are colors that can be produced by a physical light source. Any [[additive color|additive mixture]] of two real colors is also a real color. When colors are displayed in the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE 1931 XYZ color space]], additive mixture results in a color along the line between the colors being mixed. By mixing any three colors, one can therefore create any color contained in the triangle they describe — this is called the [[gamut]] formed by those three colors, which are called [[primary color]]s. Any colors outside of this triangle cannot be obtained by mixing the chosen primaries.

When defining primaries, the goal is often to leave as many real colors in gamut as possible. Since the region of real colors is not a triangle (see illustration), it is not possible to pick three real colors that span the whole region. The gamut can be increased by selecting more than three real primary colors, but since the region of real colors is not a polygon, there always will be some colors at the edge left out. Therefore, one selects colors outside of the region of real colors as primary colors; in other words, imaginary primary colors. Mathematically, the gamut created in this way contains so-called "imaginary colors".

In computer and television screen color displays, the corners of the gamut triangle are defined by commercially available [[phosphor]]s chosen to be as near as possible to pure red and pure green and pure blue, and thus are within the area of real colors; note that these color space diagrams inevitably display, instead of real colors outside your computer screen's gamut triangle, the nearest color which is inside the gamut triangle. See page [[Gamut]] for more information about the color range available on display devices.

==Imaginary colors==
One type of ''imaginary color'' (also referred to as ''non-physical'' or ''unrealizable color'') is a point in a [[color space]] that corresponds to combinations of [[cone cell]] responses in one eye, that cannot be produced by the eye in normal circumstances seeing any possible light spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/color1.html |title=Light and the eye|accessdate=May 5, 2007 |last=MacEvoy |first=Bruce |year=2005 |work=Handprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, no object can have an imaginary color. But such imaginary colors are useful as mathematical abstractions for defining [[color space]]s.

The [[spectral sensitivity]] curve of medium-wavelength ("M") cone cells overlaps those of short-wavelength ("S") and long-wavelength ("L") cone cells. Light of any [[wavelength]] that interacts with M cones also interacts with S or L cones, or both, to some extent. Therefore, no wavelength (except perhaps a bit of the far red), and no non-negative [[spectral power distribution]], excites only one sort of cone. If, for example, M cones could be excited alone, this would make the brain see an imaginary color greener than any physically possible green; producing it by seeing light would need some of the red and blue parts of visible light to have negative power, which is impossible. Such a "hyper-green" color would be in the CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram (left image to the right) in the blank area above the colored area and between the ''y''-axis and the line ''x''+''y''=1.

==Chimerical colors==
[[File:chimerical-color-demo.svg|thumb|By staring at a "fatigue template" for 20-60 seconds, then switching to a neutral target, it is possible to view "impossible" colors.]]
A ''chimerical color'' is an imaginary color that can be seen temporarily by looking steadily at a strong color for a while until some of the cone cells become fatigued, temporarily changing their color sensitivities, and then looking at a markedly different color. They are explained by the [[opponent process]] color theory.&lt;ref name=Churchland_2005&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chimerical Colors: Some Phenomenological Predictions from Cognitive Neuroscience|year=2005|last1=Churchland|first1=Paul|journal=Philosophical Psychology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=527–560|doi=10.1080/09515080500264115}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, staring at a saturated primary-color field and then looking at a white object results in an opposing shift in hue, causing an [[afterimage]] of the [[complementary colors]]. Exploration of the color space outside the range of "real colors" by this means is major corroborating evidence for the opponent process theory of color vision. Chimerical colors can be seen while seeing with one eye or with both eyes, and are not observed to reproduce simultaneously qualities of opposing colors (e.g. "yellowish blue").&lt;ref name="Churchland_2005"/&gt; Chimerical colors include:
* Stygian colors: these are simultaneously dark and impossibly saturated. For example, to see "stygian blue": staring at bright yellow causes a dark blue [[afterimage]], then on looking at black, the blue is seen as blue against the black, but due to lack of the usual brightness contrast it seems to be as dark as the black. 
* Self-luminous colors: these mimic the effect of a glowing material, even when viewed on a medium such as paper, which can only reflect and not emit its own light. For example, to see "self-luminous red": staring at green causes a red afterimage, then on looking at white, the red is seen against the white and may seem to be brighter than the white.
* Hyperbolic colors: these are impossibly highly saturated. For example, to see "hyperbolic orange": staring at bright cyan causes an orange afterimage, then on looking at orange, the resulting orange afterimage seen against the orange background may cause an orange color purer than the purest orange color that can be made by any normally-seen light. Or, staring at something pure magenta in bright sunlight for two minutes or more, thus temporarily making the red and blue cones less sensitive, and then looking at green leaves, may result in briefly seeing an unnaturally pure green afterimage.

==Claimed evidence for ability to see colors not in the color space==

[[File:Impossible Colors, Blue and Yellow.gif|thumb|Some people may be able to see the color "Yellow–Blue" in this image by letting their eyes cross so that both + symbols are on top of each other]]

[[File:Impossible Colors, Red and Green.gif|thumb|Some people may be able to see the color "Red–Green" in this image by letting their eyes cross so that both + symbols are on top of each other]]

Under normal circumstances, there is no hue that could be described as a mixture of opponent hues; that is, as a hue looking "redgreen" or "yellowblue".

In 1983, [[Hewitt D. Crane]] and Thomas P. Piantanida performed tests using an [[Eye tracking|eye-tracker]] device that had a field of a vertical red stripe adjacent to a vertical green stripe, or several narrow alternating red and green stripes (or in some cases, yellow and blue instead). The device could track involuntary movements of one eye (there was a patch over the other eye) and adjust mirrors so the image would follow the eye and the boundaries of the stripes were always on the same places on the eye's retina; the field outside the stripes was blanked with occluders. Under such conditions, the edges between the stripes seemed to disappear (perhaps due to edge-detecting [[neuron]]s becoming fatigued) and the colors flowed into each other in the brain's [[visual cortex]], overriding the opponency mechanisms and producing not the color expected from mixing paints or from mixing lights on a screen, but new colors entirely, which are not in the [[CIE 1931 color space]], either in its real part or in its imaginary parts. For red-and-green, some saw an even field of the new color; some saw a regular pattern of just-visible green dots and red dots; some saw islands of one color on a background of the other color. Some of the volunteers for the experiment reported that afterwards, they could still imagine the new colors for a period of time.&lt;ref name=Hewitt_1983&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.221.4615.1078 |jstor=1691544 |title=On Seeing Reddish Green and Yellowish Blue |year=1983 |last1=Crane |first1=Hewitt D. |last2=Piantanida |first2=Thomas P. |journal=Science |volume=221 |issue=4615 |pages=1078–80 |pmid=17736657}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some observers indicated that although they were aware that what they were viewing was a color (that is, the field was not achromatic), they were unable to name or describe the color. One of these observers was an artist with a large color vocabulary. Other observers of the novel hues described the first stimulus as a reddish-green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Suarez J|
title=Reddish Green: A Challenge for Modal Claims About Phenomenal Structure|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|doi=10.1111/j.1933-1592.2009.00247.x | year=2009 | last2=Suarez | first2=Juan | volume=78 | issue=2 | pages=346–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2001 Vincent A. Billock and Gerald A. Gleason and Brian H. Tsou set up an experiment to test a theory that the 1983 experiment did not control for variations in the perceived [[luminance]] of the colors from subject to subject: two colors are equiluminant for an observer when rapidly alternating between the colors produces the least impression of flickering. The 2001 experiment was similar but controlled for luminance.&lt;ref name="josaa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Billock|first=Vincent A.|author2=Gerald A. Gleason |author3=Brian H. Tsou |year=2001|url=http://aris.ss.uci.edu/~kjameson/BillockEtAlImpossibleColorsJOSA2001.pdf|title=Perception of forbidden colors in retinally stabilized equiluminant images: an indication of softwired cortical color opponency?|journal=Journal of the Optical Society of America A|publisher=Optical Society of America|volume=18|issue=10|pages=2398–2403|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.18.002398|accessdate=2010-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had these observations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some subjects (4 out of 7) described transparency phenomena—as though the opponent colors originated in two depth planes and could be seen, one through the other. ...

We found that when colors were equiluminant, subjects saw reddish greens, bluish yellows, or a multistable spatial color exchange (an entirely novel perceptual phenomena {{sic}}); when the colors were nonequiluminant, subjects saw spurious pattern formation.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This led them to propose a "soft-wired model of cortical color opponency", in which populations of neurons compete to fire and in which the "losing" neurons go completely silent. In this model, eliminating competition by, for instance, inhibiting connections between neural populations can allow mutually exclusive neurons to fire together.&lt;ref name="josaa"/&gt;

Hsieh and Tse in 2006 disputed the existence of colors forbidden by opponency theory and claimed they are, in reality, intermediate colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2005.11.030 |title=Illusory color mixing upon perceptual fading and filling-in does not result in "forbidden colors" |year=2006 |last1=Hsieh |first1=P.-J. |last2=Tse |first2=P.

'''Inferences''' are steps in [[reasoning]], moving from [[premise]]s to [[logical consequence]]s. [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] divided inference into three kinds: [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]].  Deduction is inference [[Formal proof|deriving]] [[Logical consequence|logical conclusions]] from premises known or assumed to be [[truth|true]],  with the [[Rule of inference|laws of valid inference]] being studied in [[logic]].  Induction is inference from [[particular]] premises to a [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]] conclusion.  Abduction is inference to the best explanation.

Human inference (i.e. how humans draw conclusions) is traditionally studied within the field of [[cognitive psychology]]; [[artificial intelligence]] researchers develop automated inference systems to emulate human inference.

[[Statistical inference]] uses mathematics to draw conclusions in the presence of uncertainty. This generalizes deterministic reasoning, with the absence of uncertainty as a special case. Statistical inference uses quantitative or qualitative (categorical) data which may be subject to random variations.

==Definition==
The process by which a conclusion is inferred from multiple observations is called [[inductive reasoning]].  The conclusion may be correct or incorrect, or correct to within a certain degree of accuracy, or correct in certain situations.  Conclusions inferred from multiple observations may be tested by additional observations.

This definition is disputable (due to its lack of clarity. Ref: Oxford English dictionary: "induction ... 3. Logic the inference of a general law from particular instances." {{clarify|reason=Some information, probably encoded by different type fonts in the dictionary, seems to have got lost. I assume, under the keyword 'induction (logic)', the dictionary says 'the inference of a general law from particular instances'. Please check with the source and clarify.|date=August 2013}}) The definition given thus applies only when the "conclusion" is general.

Two possible definitions of "inference" are:
# A conclusion reached on the basis of evidence and reasoning.
# The process of reaching such a conclusion.

==Examples==
===Example for definition #1===
[[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophers]] defined a number of [[syllogism]]s, correct three part inferences, that can be used as building blocks for more complex reasoning. We begin with a famous example:
# All humans are mortal.
# All Greeks are humans.
# All Greeks are mortal.

The reader can check that the premises and conclusion are true, but logic is concerned with inference: does the truth of the conclusion follow from that of the premises?

The validity of an inference depends on the form of the inference. That is, the word "valid" does not refer to the truth of the premises or the conclusion, but rather to the form of the inference.  An inference can be valid even if the parts are false, and can be invalid even if some parts are true.  But a valid form with true premises will always have a true conclusion.

For example, consider the form of the following [[Symbology|symbological]] track:
#All meat comes from animals.
#All beef is meat.
#Therefore, all beef comes from animals.

If the premises are true, then the conclusion is necessarily true, too.

Now we turn to an invalid form.
#All A are B.
#All C are B.
#Therefore, all C are A.

To show that this form is invalid, we demonstrate how it can lead from true premises to a false conclusion.
#All apples are fruit. (True)
#All bananas are fruit. (True)
#Therefore, all bananas are apples. (False)

A valid argument with a false premise may lead to a false conclusion, (this and the following examples do not follow the Greek syllogism):
#All tall people are French. (False)
#John Lennon was tall. (True)
#Therefore, John Lennon was French. (False)

When a valid argument is used to derive a false conclusion from a false premise, the inference is valid because it follows the form of a correct inference.

A valid argument can also be used to derive a true conclusion from a false premise:
#All tall people are musicians. (Valid, False)
#John Lennon was tall. (Valid, True)
#Therefore, John Lennon was a musician. (Valid, True)

In this case we have one false premise and one true premise where a true conclusion has been inferred.

===Example for definition #2===

Evidence:  It is the early 1950s and you are an American stationed in the [[Soviet Union]].  You read in the [[Moscow]] newspaper that a [[soccer]] team from a small city in [[Siberia]] starts winning game after game.  The team even defeats the Moscow team.  Inference: The small city in Siberia is not a small city anymore.  The Soviets are working on their own nuclear or high-value secret weapons program.

Knowns: The Soviet Union is a [[command economy]]: people and material are told where to go and what to do.  The small city was remote and historically had never distinguished itself; its soccer season was typically short because of the weather.

Explanation:  In a [[command economy]], people and material are moved where they are needed.  Large cities might field good teams due to the greater availability of high quality players; and teams that can practice longer (weather, facilities) can reasonably be expected to be better.  In addition, you put your best and brightest in places where they can do the most good—such as on high-value weapons programs.  It is an anomaly for a small city to field such a good team.  The anomaly (i.e. the soccer scores and great soccer team) indirectly described a condition by which the observer inferred a new meaningful pattern—that the small city was no longer small.  Why would you put a large city of your best and brightest in the middle of nowhere?  To hide them, of course.

==Incorrect inference==
An incorrect inference is known as a [[fallacy]]. Philosophers who study [[informal logic]] have compiled large lists of them, and cognitive psychologists have documented many [[cognitive bias|biases in human reasoning]] that favor incorrect reasoning.

==Applications==

===Inference engines===
{{main|Reasoning system|Inference engine|expert system|business rule engine}}

AI systems first provided automated logical inference and these were once extremely popular research topics, leading to industrial applications under the form of [[expert system]]s and later [[business rule engine]]s.  More recent work on [[automated theorem proving]] has had a stronger
basis in formal logic.

An inference system's job is to extend a knowledge base automatically. The knowledge base (KB) is a set of propositions that represent what the system knows about the world. Several techniques can be used by that system to extend KB by means of valid inferences. An additional requirement is that the conclusions the system arrives at are [[relevance|relevant]] to its task.

====Prolog engine====
[[Prolog]] (for "Programming in Logic") is a [[programming language]] based on a [[subset]] of [[predicate calculus]]. Its main job is to check whether a certain proposition can be inferred from a KB (knowledge base) using an algorithm called [[backward chaining]].

Let us return to our [[Socrates]] [[syllogism]]. We enter into our Knowledge Base the following piece of code:

 mortal(X) :- 	man(X).
 man(socrates). 
( Here ''''':-''''' can be read as "if".  Generally, if ''P {{imp}} Q'' (if P then Q)  then in Prolog we would code ''Q''':-'''P'' (Q if P).)&lt;br /&gt;
This states that all men are mortal and that Socrates is a man. Now we can ask the Prolog system about Socrates:

 ?- mortal(socrates).
(where ''?-'' signifies a query: Can ''mortal(socrates).'' be deduced from the KB using the rules)
gives the answer "Yes".

On the other hand, asking the Prolog system the following:

 ?- mortal(plato).

gives the answer "No".

This is because [[Prolog]] does not know anything about [[Plato]], and hence defaults to any property about Plato being false (the so-called [[closed world assumption]]). Finally
?- mortal(X) (Is anything mortal) would result in "Yes" (and in some implementations: "Yes": X=socrates)&lt;br /&gt;
[[Prolog]] can be used for vastly more complicated inference tasks. See the corresponding article for further examples.

===Semantic web===
Recently automatic reasoners found in [[semantic web]] a new field of application. Being based upon [[description logic]], knowledge expressed using one variant of [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] can be logically processed, i.e., inferences can be made upon it.

===Bayesian statistics and probability logic===
{{main|Bayesian inference}}

Philosophers and scientists who follow the [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian framework]] for inference use the mathematical rules of [[probability]] to find this best explanation. The Bayesian view has a number of desirable features—one of them is that it embeds deductive (certain) logic as a subset (this prompts some writers to call Bayesian probability "probability logic", following [[E. T. Jaynes]]).

Bayesian's identify probabilities with degrees of beliefs, with certainly true propositions having probability 1, and certainly false propositions having probability 0. To say that "it's going to rain tomorrow" has a 0.9 probability is to say that you consider the possibility of rain tomorrow as extremely likely.

Through the rules of probability, the probability of a conclusion and of alternatives can be calculated. The best explanation is most often identified with the most probable (see [[Bayesian decision theory]]). A central rule of Bayesian inference is [[Bayes' theorem]].

===Fuzzy logic===

=== Non-monotonic logic ===

{{main|Non-monotonic logic}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first=André  |last=Fuhrmann  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031209221248/http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/Fuhrmann/papers/nomoLog.pdf  |archivedate= 9 December 2003 |url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/Philosophie/Fuhrmann/papers/nomoLog.pdf  |title=Nonmonotonic Logic |ref=Fuhrmann, Nonmonotonic Logic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A relation of inference is [[monotonicity of entailment|monotonic]] if the addition of premises does not undermine previously reached conclusions; otherwise the relation is [[Nonmonotonic logic|non-monotonic]].
Deductive inference is monotonic: if a conclusion is reached on the basis of a certain set of premises, then that conclusion still holds if more premises are added.

By contrast, everyday reasoning is mostly non-monotonic because it involves risk: we jump to conclusions from deductively insufficient premises.
We know when it is worth or even necessary (e.g. in medical diagnosis) to take the risk. Yet we are also aware that such inference is defeasible—that new information may undermine old conclusions. Various kinds of defeasible but remarkably successful inference have traditionally captured the attention of philosophers (theories of induction, Peirce's theory of [[abductive reasoning|abduction]], inference to the best explanation, etc.). More recently logicians have begun to approach the phenomenon from a formal point of view. The result is a large body of theories at the interface of philosophy, logic and artificial intelligence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2776">The '''Information Management Body of Knowledge''' (IMBOK) is a management framework that organizes the concept of [[Information Management]] in the full context of business and organizational strategy, management and operations.  It is specifically intended to provide researchers and practicing managers with a tool that makes clear the conjunction of the worlds of information technology and the world at large.

==The IMBOK framework==

The IMBOK comprises six 'knowledge' areas and four 'process' areas.  The '''knowledge areas''' identify domains of management expertise and capability that are each distinctly different to the others, as shown in the figure.  The '''process areas''' identify critical activities that move the value from the left to the right.  For example:
* ''Projects'' transform ''Information technology'' into ''information systems'' by engineering technology components into systems that deliver the required functionality
* ''Business change'' management deploys ''information systems'' in ''business processes'' so as to improve the performance and capability of those business processes
* ''Business operations'' deliver the ''business benefits'' expected by stakeholders 
* ''Performance management'' ensures and oversees the delivery of benefits appropriate to an organization's strategic intentions.

[[File:IMBOK Framework.jpg|thumb|center|600 px|This framework is the basis of organizing the "Information Management Body of Knowledge" first made available in 2004.  This version is adapted by the addition of "Business information" in 2014.]]

==Origin==

The IMBOK was a major deliverable out of a research project at the [[University of the Western Cape]] in South Africa, funded by the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]].

{{Redirect|Innocent}}
[[Image:Bouguereau-Linnocence.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William-Adolphe Bouguereau|Bouguereau]]'s ''L'Innocence'':  Women, young children and lambs are all symbols of innocence.]]
[[File:Prud'hon, Pierre Paul - Venus Bathing or Innocence - c. 1810.JPG|thumb|''Innocence'' by [[Pierre Paul Prud'hon]], circa 1810]]
'''Innocence''' is a lack of [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], with respect to any kind of [[crime]], or wrongdoing. In a [[Criminal law|legal context]], innocence is to the lack of [[guilt (law)|legal guilt]] of an individual, with respect to a crime. In other contexts, it is a lack of experience.

==In relation to knowledge==
Innocence can imply lesser [[experience]] in either a relative view to social peers, or by an absolute comparison to a more common normative scale.  In contrast to ''[[ignorance]]'', it is generally viewed as a positive term, connoting an optimistic view of the world, in particular one where the lack of knowledge stems from a lack of wrongdoing, whereas greater knowledge comes from doing wrong.  This connotation may be connected with a popular [[false etymology]] explaining "innocent" as meaning "not knowing" (Latin ''noscere'' (To know, learn)). The actual etymology is from general negation prefix ''in-'' and the Latin ''nocere'', "[[to harm]]".

People who lack the mental capacity to understand the nature of their acts may be regarded as innocent regardless of their behavior.  From this meaning comes the usage of ''innocent'' as a noun to refer to a child under the [[Age of reason (canon law)|age of reason]], or a person, of any age, who is severely [[Developmental disability|mentally disabled]]. “Nonetheless, the word, innocence, is used to describe childhood innocence as a notion created and controlled by adults. As Jean-Jacques Rousseau describes 'childhood as a time of innocence' where children are 'not-knowing' and must reach the age of reason to become competent people in society. However, this is not the case anymore as technology advances, this has given children in the contemporary world a platform where they are referred to as 'digital natives', where they are seen more knowledgeable than adults &lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Danah, 1977-. It's Complicated: the Social Lives of Networked Teens. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, because of digital media and internet, young people have become well-informed of the world around and have a better understanding.

==Pejorative meaning==
In some cases, the term "innocence" has a [[pejorative]] meaning, where an assumed level of experience dictates common discourse or baseline qualifications for entry into another, different, social experience.  Since experience is a prime factor in determining a person's [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]], innocence is often also used to imply naiveté or lack of personal experience.

==Symbolism==
The [[domestic sheep|lamb]] is a commonly used symbol of innocence's nature. In [[Christianity]], for example, [[Jesus]] is referred to as the "Lamb of God", thus emphasizing his sinless nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=''Freemasonry: Its Symbolism, Religious Nature, and Law of Perfection'' (March 10, 2003)|isbn=978-0766142015|publisher=By [[Chalmers I. Paton]] (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other symbols of innocence include [[child]]ren, [[virginity|virgins]], [[acacia]] branches (especially in [[Freemasonry]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Numismatist'' (1903)|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Numismatist.html?id=WpEUAAAAYAAJ|publisher=By [[American Numismatic Association]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013|year=1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-sexual nudity, songbirds and the color [[white]] (biblical paintings and Hollywood films depict Jesus wearing a white tunic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''The Encyclopedia Americana: A Library of Universal Knowledge'' (1920)|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Encyclopedia_Americana.html?id=r8BPAAAAMAAJ|publisher=By [[Encyclopedia Americana|Encyclopedia Americana Corporation]]|accessdate=February 25, 2013|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of innocence==
A "loss of innocence" is a common theme in [[fiction]], [[popular culture|pop culture]], and [[Literary realism|realism]]. It is often seen as an integral part of [[coming of age]]. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a person's life that leads to a greater awareness of evil, pain and/or suffering in the world around them. Examples of this theme include songs like "[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Saul|last=Levitt |url=http://www.missamericanpie.co.uk/interpret.html |title=Interpretation of American Pie - analysis, news, Don McLean, Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, Rock &amp; Roll |publisher=Missamericanpie.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; poetry like [[William Blake]]'s collection [[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]] and novels like ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'', ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', ''[[A Farewell to Arms]]'', and ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''.

By contrast, the [[I ching|''I Ching'']] urges a recovery of innocence - the name given to Hexagram 25 - and "encourages you to ''actively practice innocence''".&lt;ref&gt;B. B. Walker trans, ''The I Ching or Book of Changes'' (1993) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Innocence could also be viewed as a Westernized view of childhood, and the "loss" of innocence is simply a social construction or viewed as the dominant ideology. Thinkers such as Jean-Jaques Rousseau used the romanticism discourse as a way to separate children from adults. Ideas surrounding childhood and childhood innocence stems from this discourse. It was during the 19th century when childhood became synonymous with "innocence", however not all children were considered to be innocent during that time, as it was highly dependent on the colour of one's skin. The term innocence being connected to "white childhood" was a way to racialize childhood and exclude the non-whites not only from "innocence" but from childhood as well.

==In psychoanalysis==
The [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] tradition is broadly divided between those (like [[W. R. D. Fairbairn|Fairbairn]] and [[D. W. Winnicott|Winnicott]]) who saw the child as initially innocent, but liable to lose its innocence under the impact of stress or [[psychological trauma]]; and those (like [[Freud]] and [[Melanie Klein|Klein]]) who see the child as ''developing'' innocence - maturing into it - as a result of surmounting the [[Oedipus complex]] and/or the depressive position.&lt;ref&gt;N. Symington, ''Narcissism'' (1993) p. xiv-xv&lt;/ref&gt;

More eclectically, [[Eric Berne]] saw the Child ego state, and its vocabulary, as reflecting three different possibilities: the cliches of conformity; the obscenities of revolt; and "the sweet phrases of charming innocence".&lt;ref&gt;E. Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; In a rather different formulation, [[Christopher Bollas]] used the term 'Violent Innocence' to describe a fixed and obdurate refusal to acknowledge the existence of an alternative viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;S. Cavanagh, ''Skin, Culture and Psychoanalysis'' (2013) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; - something akin to what he calls "the fascist construction, the outcome is to empty the mind of all opposition".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Adam Phillips (psychologist)|Adam Phillips]], ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sidelights==
*In ''[[The Golden Notebook]]'', a woman looks back in laughing envy at the innocence that had previously allowed her to submerge herself in the position of the 'woman-in-love'.&lt;ref&gt;Doris Lessing, ''The Golden Notebook'' (1973) p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ivy Compton-Burnett]] had one character conclude dourly of another two that "you are both of you innocent though it is an innocence rooted in your wishes for your own lives".&lt;ref&gt;I. Compton-Burnett, ''The Last and the First'' (1971) p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet vigilantism''' is the act of carrying out [[vigilante]] activities through the [[Internet]] (the communication network or [[Internet Service Provider|its service providers]]) or carried out using applications ([[World Wide Web]], [[e-mail]]) that depend on the Internet. The term encompasses vigilantism against alleged scams, crimes, and non-Internet related behavior. It was termed '''netilantism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Lennon Y.C|last2=Poon|first2=Ryan|title=Online Vigilantism: Attitudes and Experiences of University Students in Hong Kong|journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|volume=61|issue=16|pages=1912–1932|doi=10.1177/0306624X16639037|pmid=26992831|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''digilantism'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/04/21/dawn-of-the-digilante |title=Dawn Of The Digilante |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2013-04-21 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the wake of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]].

Some have suggested that the Internet's lack of central control prompted the tendency towards vigilante reactions against certain behaviors in the same way that they have prompted those behaviors to occur in the first place.&lt;ref name="crews cei"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cei.org/pdf/5569.pdf |title=Giving Chase in Cyberspace }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers note that the emergence of Internet vigilantism is an offshoot of the inability of governments to effectively police the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention, Volume 1|last=Fisher|first=Bonnie|last2=Lab|first2=Steven|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412960472|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=1027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|4}}

== Typology of internet vigilantism ==
Vigilante activities on the Web are often based on denunciations that take a punitive turn. There are many methods and ways to vigilante on the web, but they can be defined into four main dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Vigilantism, Between Denunciation and Punitive Action|last=Loveluck|first=Benjamin|publisher=De Boeck Supérieur|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=127–153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flagging ===
Mainly based on indignation, this dimension is punctual, people most of the time do not even realize they have been reported. These actions are often of low intensity, such as taking pictures, and the objective is a call to reinforce security or civility.

People most of the time do not even realize that they have been reported, so the consequences for them a generally weak. The Instagram account "[https://www.instagram.com/passengershaming/ Passenger Shaming]" is an example of that kind of vigilante.

=== Investigation ===
Investigation is the next step, it is about seeking to identify a person or a group of people. It most often rely on collective work and with more important means. Also, this field of vigilantism refers to action whose intentionality is more assertive. The investigation can be useful to help police institutions, but the risk, with a public denonciation is to make a witch hunt and limit the presumption of innocence.

=== Hounding ===
Identification and investigation with a clear objective of punishing the guilty party. It is a lot more organised than investigation. The method is very controversial because the targeting of the individual is very important {{elaboration needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Organized denunciation ===
Unlike the first three forms of online self-righteousness, these are practices that are framed by devices specifically designed for whistle-blowing and, on the other hand, more explicitly rooted in justifications. They also refer themselves to the general interest. [[WikiLeaks|Wikileaks]] is an example of that kind of organized vigilante.

==Methods==
The following are methods of Internet vigilantism that have been used or proposed for use:

===Scam baiting===
{{Main|Scam baiting}}

Scam baiting is the practice of feigning interest in a [[scam]] in order to manipulate the scammer behind it. The purpose of scam baiting might be to waste the scammers' time, embarrass him or her, cause them to reveal information which can be passed on to legal authorities in the hope that they will be prosecuted, get them to spend money, or simply to amuse the baiter.

Scam baiting emerged in response to [[e-mail]] based frauds such as the common [[Advance fee fraud|Nigerian 419 scam]]. Many websites publish transcripts of correspondences between baiters and scammers, and also publish their "trophies" online, which include videos and images scam baiters have obtained from scammers.

===Public shaming===
{{Main|Online shaming}}

The [[social networking]] tools of the World Wide Web have been used as a tool to easily and widely publicize instances of perceived anti-social behavior.

David Furlow, chairman of the Media, Privacy and Defamation Committee of the [[American Bar Association]], has identified the potential privacy concerns raised by websites facilitating the distribution of information that is not part of the [[public record]] (documents filed with a government agency), and has said that such websites "just [give] a forum to people whose statements may not reflect truth."&lt;ref name="snitching redeye"&gt;{{cite news|author=Tracy Swartz, RedEye |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-05-31/news/0705310470_1_unique-visitors-web-drivers |title=The wide world of cyber snitching |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2007-05-31 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After some controversial incidents of public shaming, the popular link-sharing and discussion website [[Reddit]] introduced a strict rule against the publication of non-public [[personally-identifying information]] via the site (colloquially known on Reddit and elsewhere as "[[doxing]]"). Those who break the rule are subject to a site-wide ban, and their posts and even entire communities may be removed for breaking the rule.

Public shaming as a form of Internet vigilantism is also prevalent in China. One of the recent cases involved a woman who cheated on her husband, who posted his wife's romantic alliance online. Online groups began targeting her lover on the street, harassing him relentlessly until he finally quit his university and stayed at home.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia|last=Miller|first=Wilbur|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2015|isbn=9781483305936|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, online shaming was the subject of a book titled [[So You've Been Publicly Shamed]] by [[Jon Ronson]].

===Distributed denial-of-service===
{{Main|Denial-of-service attack#Distributed attack}}
A DDoS attack can be used to take down malicious websites, such as those being used for phishing or [[drive-by download]]s. Thousands of people generate traffic to a website, flooding it such that it goes over quota or simply can't serve that many requests in a timely manner.

==== "Project Chanology" ====
{{Main|Project Chanology}}

Project Chanology was a protest movement against the practices of the [[Church of Scientology]] by members of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], a leaderless Internet-based group that defines itself as ubiquitous. The project was started in response to the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove material from a highly publicized interview with Scientologist [[Tom Cruise]] from the Internet in January 2008.

Project Chanology began its campaign by organizing and delivering a series of denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites. The group was successful in taking down local and global Scientology websites intermittently from January 18, 2008 until at least January 25, 2008. Anonymous had early success rendering major Scientology websites inaccessible and leaking documents allegedly stolen from Scientology computers. This resulted in a large amount of coverage on social bookmarking websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/01/25/hackers-declare-war-on-scientology.html|title=Hackers Declare War on Scientology: A shadowy Internet group has succeeded in taking down a Scientology Web site after effectively declaring war on the church and calling for it to be destroyed.|date=2008-01-25|accessdate=2008-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Operation Payback" ====
{{Main|Operation Payback}}

In September 2010, Girish Kumar, the founder of [[Aiplex Software]], admitted to using distributed denial of service attacks against known and suspected copyright violators including some large-profile P2P sites resulted in the company's servers as well as those of the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] and [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] suffering a DDoS attack themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sg.hu/cikkek/77117|title=DDoS attack against the MPAA and RIAA servers (Hungarian)|date=2010-09-22|accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack was launched by [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], coordinated through IRC; the participants have willingly given control over their [[LOIC]] to the IRC, forming a voluntary [[botnet]] in order to overpower their targets.

As a result, Aiplex went offline for a full 24 hours while the MPAA's website was unreachable for 22 hours. The RIAA, the Gallant Macmillan and ACS Law firm, as well as AFACT and the Ministry of Sound has been targeted as well.

On 16 October 2010, Anonymous launched an attack against the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]] website. The attack commenced at 17:00 [[GMT]], causing the site to go down swiftly. It was brought back online on October 22. The rationale for the attack was that the site was "Perpetuating the system that is allowing the exploitative usage of copyright and intellectual property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anonymous Takes Out UK Intellectual Property Office Website|url=http://torrentfreak.com/anonymous-takes-out-uks-intellectual-property-office-website-101017/|publisher=TorrentFreak|date=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alan Ralsky spamming incident====
{{Main|Alan Ralsky#Spamming}}

In December 2002, convicted spammer [[Alan Ralsky]] was interviewed by the [[Detroit News]]. In the interview, Ralsky defended his position by arguing that spamming was a "perfectly legal business." He also claimed that he would never quit spamming and expressed interest at some of the newest spamming technologies such as "stealth spamming".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwend22_20021122.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021124052946/http://www.freep.com/money/tech/mwend22_20021122.htm|archivedate=2002-11-24|title=Spam king lives large off others' e-mail troubles  (English)|date=2002-11-22|accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, this article was posted on [[Slashdot]], a popular technology news site. In response to Ralsky's remarks, the members of Slashdot posted his personal information and urged people to use this information to subscribe Ralsky to a number of free mailing subscriptions for the purpose of sending [[Advertising mail|junk mail]] to his home. As a result, Ralsky's home received bags of mail daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/historical-events/10-biggest-cases-of-revenge1.htm|title=10 Big Cases of Revenge (English)|date=2002-11-22|accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====MegaUpload retaliation====
In response to MegaUpload's seizure by the US Department of Justice and [[FBI]], the hacker group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] announced on Twitter, "We Anonymous are launching our largest attack ever on government and music industry sites. Lulz. The FBI didn't think they would get away with this did they? They should have expected us." Later that week, as many as 10 sites had been taken offline in response to the Megaupload shutdown including the FBI, Universal Music, RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) and Hadopi - the French government agency responsible for "protecting creative works on the Internet" and "the attacks were carried out by spreading links via Twitter and other parts of the Internet which carried out distributed denial-of-service attacks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16646023|title=Hackers retaliate over Megaupload website shutdown (English)|date=2012-01-20|accessdate=2013-03-27|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter-terrorism===
[[United States|American]] judge [[Shannen Rossmiller]], serving in [[Montana]], has a controversial role as a [[vigilante]] online terrorist-hunter, posing as militant anti-American Muslim radicals online, hoping to attract the eye of those with similar mindsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/27/bbc_al_qaeda_internet/ |title=Internet has 'given Al Qaeda wings' claims BBC potboiler |publisher=The Register |date=2005-07-27 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google bombing===
{{main|Google bomb}}
Google bombing is a process where website owners manipulate Internet search ranking algorithms to link searches from one term to another. A group of activists chose to manipulate Google by adding hyperlinks to [[George W. Bush]] and [[Michael Moore]] with the [[anchor text]] "miserable failure", so that a person searching for the term "miserable failure" was more likely to find political figures.

The [[campaign for the neologism "santorum"]] started with a contest held in May 2003 by Dan Savage, a columnist and LGBT rights activist. Savage asked his readers to create a definition for the word "santorum" in response to then-U.S. Senator Rick Santorum's views on homosexuality, and comments about same sex marriage. In his comments, Santorum had stated that "In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be." Savage announced the winning entry, which defined "[[wikt:santorum|santorum]]" as "the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex". He created a web site, spreadingsantorum.com (and santorum.com), to promote the definition, which became a top Internet search result displacing the Senator's official website on many search engines, including Google, Yahoo! Search, and Bing. Savage offered in May 2010 to remove the site if Santorum donated $5 million to Freedom to Marry, an advocacy group for [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref name=MotherJones&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mencimer |first=Stephanie |url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2010/08/rick-santorum-google-problem-dan-savage |title=Rick Santorum's Anal Sex Problem |journal=Mother Jones |issn=0362-8841 |date=September–October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lizard Squad Attacks===
In September 2014 the hacker group '[[Lizard Squad]]' carried out multiple [[Denial-of-service attack|DDoS]] attacks against a variety of online games, including Destiny, Call of Duty: Ghosts, FIFA, Madden, and The Sims 4. The game servers were brought offline multiple times, which caused a large commotion in the gaming community and on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;Hacker Group Lizard Squad Takes Down Destiny, Call of Duty, FIFA And More. (2014, September 24). Retrieved March 25, 2015, from https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2014/09/29/hacker-group-lizard-squad-takes-down-destiny-call-of-duty-fifa-and-more/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-pedophile Internet vigilantism===
[[Perverted Justice]] is a well-known example of an anti-pedophile organization that engages [[Virtual volunteering|online volunteers]] in its activities to expose and convict adults who, using email or web sites, solicit minors in order to commit child sexual abuse. As part of its initiatives, this organization posts the personal information of offenders online, including their pictures, homes, and places of business or work. It carries out its activities offline, after its members reportedly harass offenders who have been previously arrested at their workplaces and even at home.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It also often collaborates with television crews such as those from [[To Catch a Predator|Dateline]]. Some freely hosted [[blogs]] claim to expose real or potential child sex offenders. The television series ''To Catch a Predator,'' aired 12 episodes featuring this form of [[sting operation]] to lure predators into sexual liaisons. Producers used the Internet, particularly chat rooms, to entrap would-be offenders into fake assignations with minors. Once the pedophile arrives at the scene, he was publicly shamed and harangued by a television personality before getting arrested by a local law enforcement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The humiliation also entailed being booked and questioned, which were recorded for network viewing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Another initiative, Predator Hunter, headed by Wendell Kreuth, aims to track down and expose the pornography-related activities of alleged 'sexual predators'. In 2002, Kreuth disclosed details of his activities in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200204/11_robertsont_predators-m/ Chasing online predators], April 15, 2002, retrieved May 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian group [http://www.mako.org.au/ MAKO] has used the Internet to warn families about sex offenders in their areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The Advertiser|title=Public warned about abuser|author=Kim Wheatley|date=2007-02-22|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/public-warned-about-abuser/story-e6freo8c-1111113044891}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to coordinate warnings about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geelongadvertiser.com.au/article/2007/12/17/9743_news.html |title=Dad's anger at sex offender's approach - Local News - Geelong, VIC, Australia |publisher=Geelongadvertiser.com.au |date=2007-12-17 |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the subculture [[Anonymous (group)|"Anonymous"]] have also been credited for seeking out pedophiles and collaborating with law enforcement.&lt;ref name="PoliceReport"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; They describe themselves as a collection of individuals united by ideas. They left a mark with the arrest of Canadian pedophile [[Chris Forcand]].  In early November 2011, Anonymous launched Operation Darknet, which targeted websites that distribute and traffic child pornography. Anonymous reportedly leaked the personal details of more than 1,100 [[pedophile]]s to [[Pastebin]], and invited [[FBI]] and [[Interpol]] to investigate the information for leads.

Members of the [[Usenet]] group Alt.Hackers.Malicious have also been known to target and expose child predators, taking credit for dozens of arrests and convictions.  They are most well known for breaking into the [[NAMBLA]] servers on three separate occasions, downloading and disseminating the organization's membership information as well as emails which directly led to several arrests and convictions of child sexual abuse.

In June, Anonymous members claimed to have located and identified two predators in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. After passing on the information and "evidence" including a video purportedly showing one of the alleged pedophiles attempting to lure youths, Edmonton police announced they would not be able to lay charges due to a lack of real evidence. They also stated that Anonymous' interference and public attacks on their integrity in the media were interfering with their investigation of legitimate cases, and not providing them with any help. An e-mailed statement to media from Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams’ Integrated Child Exploitation (ICE) Unit in Edmonton said, "The video postings this week have not only hampered our investigations, but have also distracted our ICE team and investigators from other work," adding "The time we have spent dealing with these videos has been at the expense of other important child sexual exploitation investigations." ICE followed up by saying they are committed to working with any tipster who can help them stop child exploitation, including Anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/edmonton/Edmonton+police+call+Anonymous+information+child+luring/8515656/story.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615030103/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/edmonton/Edmonton%2Bpolice%2Bcall%2BAnonymous%2Binformation%2Bchild%2Bluring/8515656/story.html |title=Edmonton police call Anonymous information on child luring insufficient to act upon |archivedate=15 June 2013 |author=Brent Wittmeier |date=June 12, 2013 |work=www.edmontonjournal.com |accessdate=19 September 2016 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identity theft activism===
{{Main|Identity theft}}
Organizations similar to vigilante action against pedophiles also target ID theft. Posing as ID thieves, they gather stolen personal information such as "dumps" (the raw encoded information contained on a payment or identification card's magnetic stripe, microchip or transponder), bank account numbers and login information, social security numbers, etc. They then pass this information on to the associated banks, to credit monitoring companies, or to law enforcement.

Other groups specialize in the removal of [[phishing]] websites, fake banks, and fraudulent online storefronts, a practice known as "site-killing". [http://wiki.aa419.org/index.php/Main_Page Artists Against 419] is a web site specializing in the removal of fake bank websites. Such groups often use tactics like DDoS attacks on the offending website, with the aim of drawing attention to the site by its hosting service or rapid consumption of the site's monthly [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] allowance. The Artists Against 419 always argued their tools were not a denial-of-service attack. At any rate they abandoned such tactics in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.aa419.org/index.php/Bandwidth_tools_FAQ |title=New Bandwidth Policy - aa419 |publisher=Wiki.aa419.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Profit===
Some companies engage in Internet vigilantism for profit. One such example is [[MediaDefender]], a company which used methods such as entrapment, P2P poisoning, and DDoS attacks.

===Other political activism===
{{See also|Patriot hacking}}

Around the time of the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay]], which was marred by [[2008 Tibetan unrest|unrest in Tibet]], Chinese hackers claim to have hacked the websites of [[CNN]] (accused of selective reporting on the [[2008 Lhasa riots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-cnn.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409202554/http://www.anti-cnn.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-04-09 |title=Anti-CNN website |publisher=Anti-cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Carrefour]] (a French shopping chain, allegedly supporting Tibetan independence),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-swdOEI5V5g|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110328115459/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-swdOEI5V5g|archivedate=March 28, 2011|title=SBS Dateline 08年08月06日 - Chinese Nationalists and Hackers|date=6 Aug 2008|author= benlisquare| publisher=|accessdate=19 September 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;!-- video is now private --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  while websites and forums gave tutorials on how to launch a [[DDoS]] attack specifically on the CNN website.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Real crime vigilantes===
Some people form themselves into vigilante groups aiming (overtly) to expose injustice, whitewash and cover-ups in high-profile criminal cases against innocent victims, often children. Recent cases include the death of [[JonBenét Ramsey]] in the US and the disappearance of the British girl [[Disappearance of Madeleine McCann|Madeleine McCann]] in Portugal.

===Anti-software piracy Internet vigilantism===
An example cited on the tech news site securityfocus.com by Kevin Poulsen illustrates how two coders implemented and distributed a program that disguised itself as activation key generators and cracks for illegal software circulating on peer-to-peer file sharing sites. The duo researched software that was popular on these file sharing sites and tagged their code with their names. As soon as the software was executed, it displayed a large message: “Bad Pirate! So, you think you can steal from software companies do you? That's called theft, don't worry your secret is safe with me. Go thou [sic] and sin no more." The software then called back to a central server and logged the file name under which it was executed, amount of time the message was displayed on the downloader’s computer screen and their IP address. The information gathered was then re-posted onto a public website showing the downloader’s IP address and country of origin. The program also had a unique ID embedded into each downloaded copy of it for tracking purposes to keep track of how it traversed the different networks.

==Prevention==
Many sites have taken measures to prevent vigilantism. One form is the reporting and deletion of any sensitive information regarding an individual or group that can lead to their identity being known. Admins, moderators, users, and bots all take action to find and detect doxing.

==Legislative framework==
In 2002 in the [[United States]], [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Howard Berman]] proposed the ''[[Peer to Peer Piracy Prevention Act]]'', which would have protected copyright holders from liability for taking measures to prevent the distribution, reproduction or display of their copyrighted works on [[peer-to-peer]] computer networks.&lt;ref name="crews cei" /&gt; Berman stated that the legislation would have given copyright holders "both carrots and sticks" and said that "copyright owners should be free to use reasonable, limited self-help measures to thwart P2P piracy if they can do so without causing harm."&lt;ref name="findlaw berman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/commentary/20021001_berman.html |title=The Truth About The Peer To Peer Piracy Prevention Act |publisher=Writ.news.findlaw.com |date=2002-10-01 |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smith College]] assistant professor James D. Miller acknowledged the threats to the privacy of legitimate Internet users that such actions would pose, but drew comparisons with other successful crime-fighting measures that can invade privacy, such as [[metal detector]]s at [[airport]]s.&lt;ref name="miller hollywood hack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techcentralstation.com/082202B.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210184712/http://www.techcentralstation.com/082202B.html|archivedate=2005-02-10 |title=Let Hollywood Hack |publisher=Techcentralstation.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Justice''' is one of the four [[cardinal virtues]] in classical European philosophy and Roman Catholicism. It is the moderation or mean between [[selfishness]] and [[Altruism|selflessness]] – between having more and having less than one's fair share.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice is closely related, in Christianity, to the practice of [[Charity (virtue)]] because it regulates the relationships with others.  It is a cardinal virtue, which is to say that it is "pivotal", because it regulates all such relationships, and is sometimes deemed the most important of the cardinal virtues.

==Early developments==
According to Aristotle, "Justice consists in a certain equality by which the just and definite claim of another, neither more nor less, is satisfied."&lt;ref name=Slater/&gt;

This is equal insofar as each one receives what he is entitled to, but may be unequal insofar as different people may have different rights:  two children have different rights from a certain adult if that adult is the parent of one of them and not of the other. Aristotle developed the idea of [[Equity (law)|equity]] to cover irregular cases so that "the ordinance is framed to fit the circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 198-200&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macrobius]] saw Justice as existing on four different planes or levels, rising from the everyday political virtue at the lowest to the Archetypal Form of Justice at the highest.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. S. Lewis]], ''The Discarded Image'' (1976) p. 68-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity==
The just man, often mentioned in the Sacred Scriptures, is distinguished by habitual right thinking and the uprightness of his conduct toward his neighbor.&lt;ref name=ccc1807&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c1a7.htm Catechism of the Catholic Church, §1807]&lt;/ref&gt; In Colossians 4:1 St. Paul counsels "Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, realizing that you too have a Master in heaven." 
 
In Christian moral theology, Justice is a quality or habit which perfects the will and inclines it to render to each and to all what belongs to them. The object of the virtue of justice is the other person's rights, whether natural or bestowed by Church or State. Justice requires that all persons should be left in the free enjoyment of all their rights. The rights which belong to every human being inasmuch as he is a person are absolute and inalienable.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08571c.htm Slater, Thomas. "Justice." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 8. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 7 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Aristotle]]'s wake,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] developed a theory of proportional reciprocity, whereby the just man renders to each and all what is due to them in due proportion: what it is their [[moral rights|moral]] and [[legal rights|legal]] rights to do, possess, or exact.&lt;ref&gt;D. Manuel Jr, ''Contemporary Social Philosophy'' (nd) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Justice toward God is called the "[[Religion (virtue)|virtue of religion]]".&lt;ref name=ccc1807/&gt;

==Modern developments==
With the [[Late modernity|late modern]] rise in interest in [[virtue ethics]], a new interest in articulating the virtue of justice has emerged. [[John Rawls]] saw justice as the typical virtue of the institution; [[Irene van Staveren]] saw it as that of the state, marked by such indicators as votes, legitimacy, public fairness and distributive rules.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deidre McCloskey]], ''The Bourgeois Virtues'' (2007) p. 286 and p. 431&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Moral justice has been linked to the sixth and highest of [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development]].&lt;ref&gt;L. P. Nucci, ''Handbook of Moral and Character Education'' (2008) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]]ians consider that in the unconscious the image of the Father embodies a stern but fair justice;&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychooanalysis'' (1976) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jung]]ians similarly see the [[archetype]] of the King as representing the right ordering of society.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bly/M. Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (1999) p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
[[Dante]] made Justice the virtue of his sixth heaven (the sphere of Jupiter), and illustrated it through such martial figures as [[Joshua]] and [[Roland]].&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Paradise'' (1975) p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sir Philip Sydney]] wrote of "justice the chief of virtues";&lt;ref&gt;Sidney, ''A Defence of Poetry'' (1984) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Spenser]] devoted the fifth book of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' to the same theme.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (1971) p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wallace Stevens]] rejected what he called "galled Justicia/Trained to poise the tables of the law" as part of the obsolete images of the past, and favoured instead the [[modernist]] seeking out of new ruling images – new "sovereigns of the soul".&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Stevens, ''Collected Poems'' (1984) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''kick''' is a physical [[Strike (attack)|strike]] using the [[leg]], in unison usually with an area of the knee or lower using the [[foot]], [[heel]], [[tibia]], ball of the foot, blade of the foot, toes or [[knee]] (the latter is also known as a [[knee (strike)|knee strike]]). This type of attack is used frequently by [[hoof|hooved]] animals as well as humans in the context of [[stand-up fighting]].  Kicks play a significant role in many forms of [[martial arts]], such as [[savate]], [[taekwondo]], [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]], [[sikaran]], [[karate]], [[Pankration]], [[Kung Fu]], [[Vovinam]], [[kickboxing]], [[Muay Thai]], [[Yaw-Yan]], [[capoeira]], [[silat]], and [[kalaripayattu]].

Kicking is also prominent from its use in many [[sports]], especially those called [[football]]. The best known of these sports is [[association football]], also known as [[soccer]].

==History==
The English verb [[:wikt:kick|to kick]] appears only in the late 14th century, apparently as a loan from Old Norse, originally in the sense of a [[hoof|hooved]] animal delivering strikes with his hind legs; the oldest use is Biblical.

Kicks as an act of [[human aggression]] have likely existed worldwide since prehistory.  However, high kicks, aiming above the waist or to the head appear to have originated from [[Asian martial arts]].  Such kicks were introduced to the [[western martial arts|west]] in the 19th century with early [[hybrid martial arts]] inspired by Asian styles such as [[Bartitsu]] and [[Savate]]. Practice of high kicks became more universal in the second half of the 20th century with the more widespread development of hybrid styles such as [[kickboxing]] and eventually [[mixed martial arts]].

The history of the high kick in Asian martial arts is difficult to trace. It appears to be prevalent in all traditional forms of [[Indochinese kickboxing]], but these cannot be traced with any technical detail to pre-modern times. For example, [[Muay Boran]] or "ancient boxing" in Thailand was developed under [[Rama V]] (r. 1868-1910). While it is known that earlier forms of "boxing" existed during the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], the details regarding these techniques are unclear.  Some stances that look like low kicks, but not high kicks, are visible in the [[Shaolin temple]] frescoes, dated to the 17th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' ([http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m04/m04013.htm 4.13]), an [[Sanskrit epics|Indian epic]] compiled at some point before the 5th century AD, describes an unarmed hand-to-hand battle, including the sentence "and they gave each other violent kicks" (without providing any further detail).

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Applications==

As the human leg is longer and stronger than the arm, kicks are generally used to keep an opponent at a distance, surprise him or her with their range, and inflict substantial damage.  On the other hand, [[Stance (martial arts)|stance]] is very important in any combat system, and any attempt to deliver a kick will necessarily compromise one's stability of stance. The application of kicks is thus a question of the tradeoff between the power that can be delivered vs. the cost incurred to balance. Since combat situations are fluid, understanding this tradeoff and making the appropriate decision to adjust to each moment is key.

Kicks are commonly directed against helpless or downed targets, while for more general [[self-defense]] applications, the consensus is that simple kicks aimed at vulnerable targets below the chest may be highly efficient, but should be executed with a degree of care. Self-defense experts, such as author and teacher Marc Macyoung, claim that kicks should be aimed no higher than the waist/stomach.  Thus, the fighter should not compromise their balance while delivering a kick, and retract the leg properly to avoid grappling. It is often recommended to build and drill simple combinations that involve attacking different levels of an opponent. A common example would be distracting an opponent's focus via a fake jab, following up with a powerful attack at the opponent's legs and punching.

Further, since low kicks are inherently quicker and harder to see and dodge in general they are often emphasized in a street fight scenario.

==Practicality of high kicks==

The utility of high kicks (above chest level) has been debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/5/13/4324768/kicking-mma-striking-styles-crocop-renan-barao-ufc-mma |title=Kicking is starting to impact MMA striking |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents have viewed that some high front snap kicks are effective for striking the face or throat, particularly against charging opponents, and flying kicks can be effective to scare off attackers.  Martial arts systems that utilize high kicks also emphasize training of very efficient and technically perfected forms of kicks, include recovery techniques in the event of a miss or block, and will employ a wide repertoire of kicks adapted to specific situations.

Detractors have asserted that the flying/jumping kicks performed in synthesis styles are primarily performed for conditioning or aesthetic reasons while the high kicks as practiced in sport martial arts are privileged due to specialized tournament rules, such as limiting the contest to [[stand-up fighting]], or reducing the penalty resulting from a failed attempt at delivering a kick.

Although kicks can result in an easy [[takedown (grappling)|takedown]] for the opponent if they are caught or the resulting imbalance is exploited, kicks to all parts of the body are very present in [[mixed martial arts]], with some fighters employing them sporadically, while others, like [[Lyoto Machida]], [[Edson Barboza]] and [[Donald Cerrone]] rely heavily on their use and have multiple [[knockouts]] by kicks on their resumee.

==Basic kicks==

===Front kick===
{{Main|Front kick}}
[[Image:EVD-taekwondo-061.jpg|thumb|Taekwondo front kick]]
Delivering a front kick involves raising the [[knee]] and [[foot]] of the striking leg to the desired height and extending the leg to contact the target. The actual strike is usually delivered by the [[ball of the foot]] for a forward kick or the top of the toes for an upward kick. [[Taekwondo]] practitioners utilize both the heel and ball of the foot for striking. Various combat systems teach 'general' front kick using the heel or whole foot when footwear is on. Depending of fighter's tactical needs, a front kick may involve more or less body motion. Thrusting one's hips is a common method of increasing both reach and power of the kick. The front kick is typically executed with the upper body straight and balanced. Front kicks are typically aimed at targets below the chest: stomach, thighs, groin, knees or lower. Highly skilled martial artists are often capable of striking head-level targets with front kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Breen |first=Andrew |url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/daily/martial-arts-techniques/kicks/the-front-kick-how-to-do-it-when-to-use-it-what-to-destroy-with-it-part-1/ |title=The Front Kick: How to Do It, When to Use It, What to Destroy With It (Part 1) – - Black Belt |publisher=Blackbeltmag.com |date=2013-04-29 |accessdate=2014-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112133655/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/daily/martial-arts-techniques/kicks/the-front-kick-how-to-do-it-when-to-use-it-what-to-destroy-with-it-part-1/# |archive-date=2014-01-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/3/19/2872876/ufc-strikeforce-judo-chop-front-kick-lyoto-machida-anderson-silva-josh-thomson-ko |title=Judo Chop: Front Kicks With Lyoto Machida, Anderson Silva, Josh Thomson |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roundhouse kick ===
{{Main|Roundhouse kick}}
[[File:Muay Thai High kick.jpg|thumb| Roundhouse Kick]]
This is the most commonly used kick in [[kickboxing]] due to its power and ease of use.  In most styles, the [[instep]] is used to strike, though most Karate styles would allow the shin as official technique for a street fight. To execute, the attacker swings their leg sideways in a circular motion, kicking the opponent's side with the front of the leg, usually with the instep, ball of the foot, toe, or shin. Also performable is a 360-degree kick in which the attacker performs a full circle with their leg, in which the striking surface is generally either the instep, shin or ball of the foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/2/6/2773302/ufc-143-stephen-thompson-judo-chop-instep-roundhouse-kick |title=UFC 143 Judo Chop: The Instep Roundhouse Kick Of Stephen Thompson |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many variations of the roundhouse kick based on various chambering of the cocked leg (small, or full, or universal or no chambering) or various footwork possibilities (rear-leg, front-leg, hopping, switch, oblique, dropping, ground spin-back or full 360 spin-back). An important variation is the downward roundhouse kick, nicknamed the Brazilian Kick from recent K-1 use: A more pronounced twist of the hips allows for a downward end of the trajectory of the kick that is very deceiving.&lt;ref&gt;The Essential Book of Martial Arts Kicks: 89 Kicks from Karate, Taekwondo, Muay Thai, Jeet Kune Do, and Others by Marc De Bremaeker and Roy Faige&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its power, the roundhouse kick may also be performed at low level against targets, such as the knees, calf, or even thigh, since attacking leg muscles will often cripple an opponent's mobility.

===Side kick===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Kickboxing]] --&gt;
{{Redirect|Side kick||Sidekick (disambiguation)}}

The side kick refers to a kick that is delivered sideways in relation to the body of the person kicking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2012/10/27/3562436/ufc-macau-anderson-silva-cung-le-bruce-lee-judo-chop-mma-technique |title=UFC Macau Judo Chop: Anderson Silva, Cung Le, Bruce Lee and the Side Kick |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of the most adaptable kicks, useful as both an offensive move and as a defensive counter to a blitzing opponent. There are two areas that are commonly used as impact points in sidekicks: the heel of the foot or the outer edge of the foot. The heel is more suited to hard targets such as the ribs, stomach, jaw, temple and chest. However, when executing a side kick with the heel, the toes should be pulled back so that they only make contact the heel and not with the whole foot. If a person hits with the arch or the ball of the foot, it can injure the foot or break an ankle. A standard sidekick is performed by first chambering the kicking leg diagonally across the body, then extending the leg in a linear fashion toward the target, while flexing the abdominals.

Another way of doing the side kick is to make it an end result of a faked roundhouse. This technique is considered antiquated, and used only after an opponent is persuaded to believe it is a roundhouse, and then led to believe that closing the distance is best for an upper body attack, which plays into the tactical position and relative requirement of this version of the side kick. In Korean, ''yeop chagi''. In Okinawan te fighting, it is sometimes called a ''dragon kick''. Some have called this side kick a "twist kick" due to its roundhouse like origins. This side kick begins as would a roundhouse kick however the practitioner allows the heel to move towards the center of the body. The kick is then directed outward from a cross-leg chamber so that the final destination of the kick is a target to the side, rather than one that is directly ahead.

===Back kick===
[[Image:EVD-taekwondo-083.jpg|thumb|left|Taekwondo back kick.]]
Also referred to as a donkey kick, mule kick, or turning back kick. This kick is directed backwards, keeping the kicking leg close to the standing leg and using the heel as a striking surface. In wushu, this kick is called the "half-moon" kick but involves the slight arching of the back and a higher lift of the leg to give a larger curvature. It is often used to strike opponents by surprise when facing away from them.

==Advanced kicks==
These are often complicated variations of basic kicks, either with a different target or combined with another move, such as jumping.

===Axe kick===&lt;!-- Aerial cartwheel links to this anchor; please don't change without fixing links --&gt;
[[File:München WKU 2013 Christine Theiss 231.JPG|thumb|Axe kick by [[Christine Theiss]] 2013]]
In Japanese, ''kakato-geri'' or ''kakato-otoshi''; in Korean, ''doki bal chagi'' or ''naeryeo chagi'' or "chikka chagi". In Chinese, "pigua tui" or "xiapi tui".

An axe kick, also known as a ''hammer kick'' or ''stretch kick'', is characterized by a straightened leg with the heel descending onto an opponent like the blade of an [[axe]]. It begins with one foot rising upward as in a crescent kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2010/6/16/1518356/bloody-elbow-judo-chop-mirko-cro |title=Judo Chop: Mirko "Cro Cop" Filipovic Unleashes an Axe Kick on Pat Barry |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upward arc motion is stopped, and then the attacking foot is lowered so as to strike the target from above. The arc can be performed in either an inward (counter-clockwise) or outward (clockwise) fashion.

A well-known proponent of the axe kick was [[Andy Hug]], the Swiss Kyokushinkai Karateka who won the 1996 [[K-1 Grand Prix]].

===Butterfly kick===
{{Main|Butterfly kick}}
[[Image:Butterfly Kick Samuel Lee.gif|right|thumb|200px|Wushu Butterfly kick (animated video)]]

The butterfly kick is done by doing a large circular motion with both feet in succession, making the combatant airborne. There are many variations of this kick. The kick may look like a slanted aerial cartwheel, and at the same time, the body spins horizontally in a circle. It begins as a jump with one leg while kicking with the other, then move the kicking leg down and the jumping leg up into a kick, landing with the first kicking leg, all while spinning. This kick involves also the arching the back backwards when airborne to give a horizontal body with high angled legs to the horizontal. It may also resemble a jumping spin roundhouse kick (developed by James 'Two Screens' Perkins) into a spinning [[hook kick]], all in one jump and one spin although the difference is that both legs should remain in the air at the same time for a considerable amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO2Skxg_GLQ |title=Shaolin Kung Fu Stretches &amp; Moves : Butterfly Kick in Shaolin Kung Fu |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First practiced in Chinese martial arts, the butterfly kick, or "xuan zi", is widely viewed as ineffective for actual combat.  However, its original purpose was to evade an opponent's floor sweep and flip to the antagonist's exposed side or it may be used as a double aerial kick to an opponent standing off to the side. It is now widely used in demonstrative wushu forms (taolu) as a symbol of difficulty. Also note the similarity in execution when compared to an ice skating maneuver known as a [[Camel_spin#Variations|flying camel spin]] (aka: [[Dick_Button|Button]] Camel).

===Calf kick===
This strike is a low roundhouse kick that hits the backside of the [[Calf (anatomy)|calf]] with the [[Shin (anatomy)|shin]]. While a Calf Kick sacrifices range in comparison to a standard low roundhouse kick to the thigh, the Calf Kick can't be checked with a knee or grabbed with an arm making it a safer kick for a striker in MMA matches vs opponents capable of checking low kicks or grapplers looking for takedown opportunities.

===Crescent kick===
In Japanese, ''mikazuki Geri''; in Korean, ''bandal chagi'' (반달 차기).

The crescent kick, also referred to as a 'swing' kick, has some similarities to a [[hook kick]], and is sometimes practised as an off-target front snap kick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1908450-kicks-arent-going-anywhere-part-2-katsunori-kikuno |title=Kicks Aren't Going Anywhere Part 2: Katsunori Kikuno |publisher=Bleacher Report |date=2014-01-02 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leg is bent like the front kick, but the knee is pointed at a target to the left or right of the true target. The energy from the snap is then redirected, whipping the leg into an arc and hitting the target from the side. This is useful for getting inside defenses and striking the side of the head or for knocking down hands to follow up with a close attack. In many styles of [[T'ai chi ch'uan]] and [[Kalaripayattu]], crescent kicks are taught as tripping techniques. When training for crescent kicks, it is common to keep the knee extended to increase the difficulty. This also increases the momentum of the foot and can generate more force, though it takes longer to build up the speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2010/4/5/1387681/bloody-elbow-judo-chop-katsunori |title=Judo Chop: Katsunori Kikuno Puts the Crescent Kick To Work on Kuniyoshi Hironaka at DREAM.13 |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''inward'''/'''inner'''/'''inside''' crescent hits with the inside edge of the foot. Its arch is clockwise for the left leg and counter-clockwise for the right leg. Force is generated by both legs' hip adduction. The inward variant has also been called a ''hangetsu geri'' (Half moon kick) in karate and is employed to "wipe" an opponents hand off of one's wrist. It can quickly be followed up by a low side-blade kick to the knee of the offender.

The '''outward'''/'''outer'''/'''outside''' crescent hits with the 'blade', the outside edge of the foot. Its path is counter-clockwise for the left leg and clockwise for the right leg, and force is generated by both legs' hip abduction. This is similar to a rising side kick, only with the kicking leg's hip flexed so that the line of force travels parallel to the ground from front to side rather than straight up, beginning and ending at the side.

===Hook kick===
In Korean, ''huryeo chagi'' (후려 차기) or ''golcho chagi''.
[[Image:Steven Ho Martial Arts Kick.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Ho (martial artist)|Steven Ho]] executing a Jump Spin Hook kick]]
The hook kick strikes with the heel from the side (or flat of the foot in sparring). It is executed similar to a side kick. However, the kick is intentionally aimed slightly off target in the direction of the kicking foot's toes. At full extension, the knee is bent and the foot snapped to the side, impacting the target with the heel. In Taekwondo it is often used at the resulting miss of a short slide side kick to the head, but is considered a very high level technique in said circumstance. Practitioners of [[jeet kune do]] frequently use the term ''heel hook kick'' or ''sweep kick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmafighting.com/2013/7/21/4543338/technique-talk-henri-hooft-on-the-rise-of-spinning-kicks-and-attacks/in/3450013 |title=Technique Talk: Henri Hooft on the rise of spinning kicks and attacks in mixed martial arts |publisher=MMA Fighting |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7g2gzoqK14&amp;feature=related |title=Taekwondo Kicks : Taekwondo Reverse Hook Kick |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/9/24/4762484/judo-chop-chris-clements-spinning-sweep-kick-stephen-thompson-gif-andy-hug |title=UFC 165 Judo Chop: Chris Clement's Spinning Sweep Kick |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known as [[Gancho]] in [[Capoeira]].

There are many variations of the hook kick, generally based on different footworks: rear- or front-leg, oblique or half-pivot, dropping, spin-back and more. The hook kick can be delivered with a near-straight leg at impact, or with a hooked finish (Kake in Japanese Karate) where the leg bends before impact to catch the target from behind. An important variation is the downward hook kick, delivered as a regular or a spin-back kick, in which the end of the trajectory is diagonally downwards for a surprise effect or following an evading opponent.

The hook kick is mainly used to strike the jaw area of an opponent, but is also highly effective in the temple region.

===Reverse roundhouse/wheel kick===
[[Image:Triple Reverse Turning Kick Combo Samuel Lee.gif|right|thumb|200px|Low, middle and high Reverse roundhouse kicks performed in succession]]
In Japanese, {{Nihongo|ushiro mawashi geri|後ろ回し蹴り}}; in Korean, ''bandae dollyo chagi'' (반대 돌려 차기), ''dwit hu ryo chagi'', ''nakkio mom dollyo chagi'' or ''parryo chagi''.

This kick is also known as a ''heel kick'', ''reverse turning kick'', ''reverse round kick'', ''spinning hook kick'', ''spin kick'', or "wheel kick".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodyelbow.com/2013/11/11/5081204/ufn-31-rustam-khabilov-jorge-masvidal-spinning-kick-gif-ko-mma-technique-judo-chop |title=UFN 31 Judo Chop: Rustam Khabilov's Spinning Hook Kick |publisher=Bloody Elbow |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low reverse roundhouse is also known as a ''Sweep Kick''. This kick traditionally uses the heel to strike with. The kicking leg comes from around the kicker's back and remains straight, unlike a reverse hooking kick. See above for more on hook kicks. Variations exist for low, middle and high height. Spinning and leaping variations of the kick are also popular, and are often showcased in film and television media.  Edson Barboza executed the first wheel kick for a knockout in the UFC at UFC 142:Aldo vs. Mendes.  He knocked out Terry Etim 3:23 into the third round of their fight. [[Mickie James]] uses this move calling it ''Mick-Kick''

A different kick that is similarly named also exists. It is literally a [[roundhouse kick]] performed by turning as if for a ''back straight kick'' and executing a roundhouse kick.  It is known as a ''Reverse Roundhouse Kick'' because the kicker turns in the opposite, or "reverse", direction before the kick is executed. This kick strikes with the ball of the foot for power or the top of the foot for range. The kick was exhibited by [[Bruce Lee]] on numerous occasions in his films [[Enter the Dragon]], [[Fist of Fury]] and [[The Big Boss]]. Bill Wallace was also a great user of this kick, as seen in his fight with Bill Briggs, where he KO'd his opponent with the clocked 60&amp;nbsp;mph kick. The Jump Spin Hook Kick was popularized in the mid-eighties by Steven Ho in open martial art competitions.

In Olympic format (sport) [[taekwondo]], this technique is performed using the balls of the feet, and in a manner similar to a [[back kick|back thrust]], rather than the circular technique adopted in other styles/Martial Arts.

===Flying kicks===
{{Main|Flying kick}}
[[Image:Flying back kick Samuel Lee.gif|thumb|Flying back kick. ''Note: The running-up part of the flying kick sequence is cut off in this animation, so only the jumping component of the kick is seen''.]]

A flying kick, in martial arts, is a general description of kicks that involve a running start, jump, then a kick in mid-air. Compared to a regular kick, the user is able to achieve greater momentum from the run at the start. Flying kicks are not to be mistaken for jumping kicks, which are similar maneuvers. A jumping kick is very similar to a flying kick, except that it lacks the running start and the user simply jumps and kicks from a stationary position. Flying kicks are often derived from the basic kicks. Some of the more commonly known flying kicks are the: flying side kick, flying back kick and the flying [[roundhouse kick]], as well as the flying [[reverse roundhouse kick]]. [[Flying kicks]] are commonly practiced in [[Taekwondo]], [[Karate]], [[Chinese martial arts|Wushu]], and Muay Thai for fitness, exhibitions and competition. It is known as ''tobi geri'' in Japanese martial arts, and ''twyo chagi'' in Taekwondo.

===Scissor kick===
{{Main|Scissor kick (martial arts)}}

Several kicks may be called a scissor kick, involving swinging out the legs to kick multiple targets or using the legs to [[Takedown (grappling)|take down]] an opponent.

The popularized version of a scissor kick is, while lying down, or jumping, the kicker brings both legs to both sides of the opponent's legs or to their body and head, then brings both in as a take down (as the name states, leg motions are like that of a pair of scissors).

The scissor kick in Taekwondo is called ''kawi chagi''. In [[Capoeira]] it is called tesoura (scissors).

Scissor kicks and other variants are also commonly applied in [[Vovinam]].

===Spinning heel kick===
A spinning heel kick is where the artist turns his/her body 360 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s before landing the heel or the ball of his/her foot on the target. It is found in Muay Thai and is known in Capoeira as armada.

===Vertical kick (thrust kick/push kick/side kick)===
The vertical kick involves bringing the knee forward and across the chest, then swinging the hip while extending the kicking leg outward, striking with the outside ("sword") edge of the foot.  It can deliver a considerable amount of power.  This is called a ''yoko geri keage'' in karate.

In Taekwondo, the vertical kick is called ''sewo chagi'', and can be performed as either an inward (''anuro'') or outward (''bakuro'') kick.

===Multiple kick===
In Japanese karate, the term ''ren geri'' is used for several kicks performed in succession.  Old karate did not promote the use of the legs for weapons as much as modern karate does, seeing them as being too open for countering.  However, in modern sport karate (non-traditional) competitions, the ability to use multiple kicks without setting the foot down has become a viable option, not only for effectiveness but also for stylish aesthetics.

In Taekwon-Do, three types of multiple kick are distinguished:

Double kick (''i-jung chagi'') - two kicks of the same type executed in succession by the same foot in the same direction.

Consecutive kick (''yonsok chagi'') - two or more kicks executed in succession by the same foot but in different directions, or with different attacking tools.

Combination kick (''honhap chagi'') - two or more kicks executed in succession by both feet.

One such Multiple Kick commonly seen in Taekwon-Do, is a slightly complex Side Kick where a High Side Kick is followed by a Low Side Kick which is in turn followed by a more powerful Side Kick. This combination is done rapidly and is meant not for multiple targets but for a single one. The Multiple Kick usually targets the face, thigh, and chest, but in turn can be a multiple chest attack which is useful for knocking the breath out of an attacker. The Multiple Kick is usually done in the "second" style described in the Side Kick article which "involves shooting the leg forward as in a front kick and then pivoting and turning so" to actually deliver a side kick. That style "has far less power but is much faster and more deceptive", which is what the Multiple Kick was designed for. The Multiple Kick, unlike some Side Kicks or "side blade kicks", never uses the outer edge of the foot; it is intended solely for the heel to be used as the impact point.  Depending on the strength and skill of the attacker and the attacked, the combination can be highly effective or highly ineffective when compared to more pragmatic attacks. In some encounters with highly trained and conditioned fighters, multiple side-kicks have seen disastrous results against the abs of their targets.

===Showtime kick===
The Showtime kick gained notability after being used by [[mixed martial arts|mixed martial artist]] [[Anthony Pettis]], during his fight gainst [[Benson Henderson]] on December 16, at [[WEC 53]] for the [[List of WEC champions#Lightweight Championship|WEC Lightweight Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmaweekly.com/absolutenm/templates/dailynews.asp?articleid=12683&amp;zoneid=13 |title=HENDERSON VS.

==Mindfulness practice==
Mindfulness practice involves the process of developing the skill of bringing one’s attention to whatever is happening in the present moment.&lt;ref name=" Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Mindfulness in plain English"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gunaratana |first1=Bhante |title= Mindfulness in plain English |date=2011 |publisher= Wisdom Publications |location= Boston |isbn=978-0861719068 |page=21 |url= http://www.wisdompubs.org/sites/default/files/preview/Mindfulness%20in%20Plain%20English%20Book%20Preview.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several exercises designed to develop mindfulness meditation, which are aided by [[guided meditation]]s "to get the hang of it."&lt;ref&gt;Kabat-Zinn himself, in ''Full Catastrophe Living (Revised Edition)'' (2013), p. lxiv&lt;/ref&gt;{{R|"Nisbet"}}{{refn|group=note|Kabat-Zinn, in ''Full Catastrophe Living (Revised Edition)'' (2013), p. lxiv advises to use CD's with guided mindfulness practices: "Almost everybody finds it easier, when embarking for the first time on a daily meditation practice, to listen to an instructor-guided audio program and let it "carry them along" in the early stages, until they get the hang of it from the inside, rather than attempting to follow instructions from a book, however clear and detailed they may be."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compare Rupert Gethin (2004), ''On the practice of Buddhist meditation'', pp. 202–03, noting that the Buddhist sutras hardly explain how to meditate, and then stating that "the effective practice of meditation requires the personal instruction of a teacher." Gethin seems to echo Vetter (1988), ''The Ideas and Meditative Practices of Early Buddhism'', who notes that the ''[[:Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta]]'' describes the Buddha as instructing his first followers in turn: instructing two or three of them, while the others go out begging for food, signifying the need of personal instruction to learn ho to practice ''dhyana''.}} One method is to sit on a straight-backed chair or sit cross-legged on the floor or a cushion, close one’s eyes and bring attention to either the sensations of breathing in the proximity of one’s nostrils or to the movements of the abdomen when breathing in and out.&lt;ref group=web name=AskDrK&gt;{{cite web |last=Komaroff |first=Anthony |title=Does "mindfulness meditation" really help relieve stress and anxiety? |url= http://www.askdoctork.com/mindfulness-meditation-really-help-relieve-stress-anxiety-201403316226 |work=Ask Doctor K |publisher= Harvard Health Publications |accessdate=22 April 2014 |date= March 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Wilson|2014}}&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt; In this meditation practice, one does not try to control one’s breathing, but attempts to simply be aware of one’s natural breathing process/rhythm.&lt;ref name=" Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt; When engaged in this practice, the mind will often run off to other thoughts and associations, and if this happens, one passively notices that the mind has wandered, and in an accepting, non-judgmental way, returns to focusing on breathing.

Other meditation exercises to develop mindfulness include body-scan meditation where attention is directed at various areas of the body and noting body sensations that happen in the present moment.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt;  Engaging in yoga practices, while attending to movements and body sensations, as well as walking meditation are other methods of developing mindfulness.&lt;ref name=" Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt;  One could also focus on sounds, sensations, thoughts, feelings and actions that happen in the present.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mindfulness in plain English"/&gt; In this regard, a famous exercise, introduced by Kabat-Zinn in his [[#Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR|MBSR]] program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/mindfulness-based-programs/mbsr-courses/about-mbsr/history-of-mbsr/]&lt;/ref&gt; is the mindful tasting of a raisin,{{sfn|Ihnen|Flynn|2008|p=148}} in which a raisin is being tasted and eaten mindfully.{{sfn|Teasdale|Segal|2007|pp=55–56}}{{refn|group=note|See also [http://hfhc.ext.wvu.edu/r/download/114469 ''Eating One Raisin: A First Taste of Mindfulness''] for a hand-out file}}

Meditators are recommended to start with short periods of 10 minutes or so of meditation practice per day. As one practices regularly, it becomes easier to keep the attention focused on breathing.&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Time2014"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24640415 |year=2014 |author1= Pickert |first1=K |title=The art of being mindful.

===Sati and smṛti===
{{Main|Sati (Buddhism)}}

The Buddhist term translated into English as "mindfulness" originates in the Pali term ''[[Sati (Buddhism)|sati]]'' and in its Sanskrit counterpart [[smriti|''smṛti'']]. It is often translated as "bare attention," but in the Buddhist tradition it has a broader meaning and application, and the meaning of these terms has been the topic of extensive debate and discussion.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942}}

According to Bryan Levman writing in the ''Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies'', "the word ''sati'' incorporates the meaning of 'memory' and 'remembrance' in much of its usage in both the ''suttas'' and the [traditional Buddhist] commentary, and... without the memory component, the notion of mindfulness cannot be properly understood or applied, as mindfulness requires memory for its effectiveness".&lt;ref name=levman17&gt;[http://www.jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/view/167 Bryan Levman (2017)], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Robert Sharf, ''smṛti'' originally meant "to remember," "to recollect," "to bear in mind," as in the Vedic tradition of remembering the sacred texts. The term ''sati'' also means "to remember." In the ''Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta'' the term ''sati'' means to remember the [[dharma]]s, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942}} Sharf refers to the [[Milindapañha]], which explained that the arisement of ''sati'' calls to mind the wholesome [[dhamma]]s such as the four establishings of mindfulness, the five faculties, the [[Bodhipakkhiyādhammā#Five powers|five powers]], the seven awakening-factors, the noble eight-factored path, and the attainment of insight.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|pp=942–43}} According to Rupert Gethin, 
{{quote|[''sati''] should be understood as what allows awareness of the full range and extent of ''dhammas''; ''sati'' is an awareness of things in relation to things, and hence an awareness of their relative value. Applied to the ''satipaṭṭhānas'', presumably what this means is that ''sati'' is what causes the practitioner of yoga to "remember" that any feeling he may experience exists in relation to a whole variety or world of feelings that may be skillful or unskillful, with faults or faultless, relatively inferior or refined, dark or pure."{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=943}}{{refn|group=note|Quotes from Gethin, Rupert M.L. (1992), ''The Buddhist Path to Awakening: A Study of the Bodhi-Pakkhiȳa Dhammā''. Brill's Indological Library, 7. Leiden and New York: Brill}}}}

Sharf further notes that this has little to do with "bare attention," the popular contemporary interpretation of ''sati'', "since it entails, among other things, the proper discrimination of the moral valence of phenomena as they arise."{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=943}}

[[Georges Dreyfus]] has also expressed unease with the definition of mindfulness as "bare attention" or "nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness", stressing that mindfulness in Buddhist context means also "remembering", which indicates that the function of mindfulness also includes the retention of information.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Dreyfus concludes his examination by stating: "[T]he identification of mindfulness with bare attention ignores or, at least, underestimates the cognitive implications of mindfulness, its ability to bring together various aspects of experience so as to lead to the clear comprehension of the nature of mental and bodily states. By over-emphasizing the nonjudgmental nature of mindfulness and arguing that our problems stem from conceptuality, contemporary authors are in danger of leading to a one-sided understanding of mindfulness as a form of therapeutically helpful spacious quietness. I think that it is important not to lose sight that mindfulness is not just a therapeutic technique but is a natural capacity that plays a central role in the cognitive process. It is this aspect that seems to be ignored when mindfulness is reduced to a form of nonjudgmental present-centered form of awareness of one’s experiences.&lt;ref name="Dreyfus"&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Mindfulness_Present-Centered_Nonjudgmental-Attention_Introspection-A-Discussion_Dreyfus.html "Is Mindfulness Present-Centered and Nonjudgmental? A Discussion of the Cognitive Dimensions of Mindfulness"] by Georges Dreyfus&lt;/ref&gt;}} Robert H. Sharf notes that Buddhist practice is aimed at the attainment of "correct view", not just "bare attention".&lt;ref group=web name="Sharf" /&gt;{{refn|group=note|Sharf: "[[Mahasi Sayadaw|Mahasi]]’s technique did not require familiarity with Buddhist doctrine (notably abhidhamma), did not require adherence to strict ethical norms (notably monasticism), and promised astonishingly quick results. This was made possible through interpreting sati as a state of "bare awareness" – the unmediated, non-judgmental perception of things "as they are," uninflected by prior psychological, social, or cultural conditioning. This notion of mindfulness is at variance with premodern Buddhist epistemologies in several respects. Traditional Buddhist practices are oriented more toward acquiring "correct view" and proper ethical discernment, rather than "no view" and a non-judgmental attitude."&lt;ref group=web name="Sharf"&gt;[http://blogs.mcgill.ca/tcpsych/tag/geoffrey-samuel/ Robert H. Sharf, ''Mindfulness or Mindlessness: Traditional and Modern Buddhist Critiques of "Bare Awareness"'']&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Jay Garfield]], quoting [[Shantideva]] and other sources, stresses that mindfulness is constituted by the union of two functions, ''calling to mind'' and vigilantly ''retaining in mind''. He demonstrates that there is a direct connection between the practice of mindfulness and the cultivation of morality – at least in the context of Buddhism from which modern interpretations of mindfulness are stemming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info-buddhism.com/Mindfulness-and-Morality-J-Garfield.html "Mindfulness and Ethics: Attention, Virtue and Perfection"] by Jay Garfield&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===
The Pali-language scholar [[Thomas William Rhys Davids]] (1843–1922) first translated ''sati'' in 1881 as English ''[[Wikt:mindfulness|mindfulness]]'' in ''sammā-sati'' "Right Mindfulness; the active, watchful mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=T.W. Rhys |last1=Davids |year=1881 |title=Buddhist Suttas |publisher=Clarendon Press |oclc=13247398 |page=107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that Daniel John Gogerly (1845) initially rendered ''sammā-sati'' as "Correct meditation",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gogerly |first1=D.J. |year=1845 |title=On Buddhism |journal=Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume=1 |pages=7–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davids explained: 
{{quote|''sati'' is literally 'memory' but is used with reference to the constantly repeated phrase 'mindful and thoughtful' (''sato sampajâno''); and means that activity of mind and constant presence of mind which is one of the duties most frequently inculcated on the good Buddhist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=T.W.

===Alternative translations===
[[John D. Dunne]] asserts that the translation of ''sati'' and  ''smṛti'' as mindfulness is confusing. A number of Buddhist scholars have started trying to establish "retention" as the preferred alternative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Lecture, Stanford University Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education |url= http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |publisher=The Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171057/http://ccare.stanford.edu/node/21 |archivedate= 2012-11-20 |date=2011 |deadurl= yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

===Psychology===
A.M. Haynes and G. Feldman have highlighted that mindfulness can be seen as a strategy that stands in contrast to a strategy of avoidance of emotion on the one hand and to the strategy of emotional overengagement on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/clipsy/bph080 |title=Clarifying the Construct of Mindfulness in the Context of Emotion Regulation and the Process of Change in Therapy |journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=255–62 |year=2004 |last1=Hayes |first1=A.M |citeseerx= 10.1.1.168.5070 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness can also be viewed as a means to develop self-knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

====Trait, state and practice====
According to Brown, Ryan, and Creswell, definitions of mindfulness are typically selectively interpreted based on who is studying it and how it is applied. Some have viewed mindfulness as a mental state, while others have viewed it as a set of skills and techniques.&lt;ref name="Brown et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/10478400701598298 |title=Mindfulness: Theoretical Foundations and Evidence for its Salutary Effects |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=211–37 |year=2007 |last1=Brown |first1=Kirk Warren |last2=Ryan |first2= Richard M |last3=Creswell |first3=J. David }}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction can also be made between the ''state'' of mindfulness and the ''trait'' of mindfulness.{{sfn|Gehart|2012|pp=7–8}}

According to David S. Black, whereas "mindfulness" originally was associated with esoteric beliefs and religion, and "a capacity attainable only by certain people",{{sfn|Black|2011|p=1}} scientific researchers have translated the term into measurable terms, providing a valid operational definition of mindfulness.{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}}{{refn|group=note|Black: "[S]everal decades of research methodology and scientific discovery have defrayed these myths; mindfulness is now widely considered to be an inherent quality of human consciousness. That is, a capacity of attention and awareness oriented to the present moment that varies in degree within and between individuals, and can be assessed empirically and independent of religious, spiritual, or cultural beliefs.{{sfn|Black|2011|p=1}}}} Black mentions three possible domains:{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}}
# A trait, a dispositional characteristic (a relatively long lasting trait),{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}} a person's tendency to more frequently enter into and more easily abide in mindful states;{{sfn|Gehart|2012|p=7}}
# A state, an outcome (a state of awareness resulting from mindfulness training),{{sfn|Black|2011|p=2}} being in a state of present-moment awareness;{{sfn|Gehart|2012|p=7}}
# A practice (mindfulness meditation practice itself).{{refn|group=note|"Mindfulness meditation" may refer to either the secular, western practice of mindfulness,{{sfn|Zgierska|2009}} or to modern Buddhist [[Vipassana|Vipassana-meditation]].{{sfn|Didonna|2008|p=27}}{{sfn|Kristeller|2007|p=393}}{{sfn|Germer|2005|p=15}}}}

=====Trait-like constructs=====
According to Brown, mindfulness is:
{{quote|A quality of consciousness manifest in, but not isomorphic with, the activities through which it is enhanced."&lt;ref name="Brown et al 2007"/&gt;}}

Several mindfulness measures have been developed which are based on self-reporting of trait-like constructs:{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=10}}
* [https://ppc.sas.upenn.edu/resources/questionnaires-researchers/mindful-attention-awareness-scale Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)]
* Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI)
* Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS)
* Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS)
* Mindfulness Questionnaire (MQ)
* Revised Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale (CAMS-R)
* Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS)

=====State-like phenomenon=====
According to Bishop, et alia, mindfulness is, "A kind of nonelaborative, nonjudgmental, present-centered awareness in which each thought, feeling, or sensation that arises in the attentional field is acknowledged and accepted as it is."&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004"/&gt;

* The Toronto Mindfulness Scale (TMS) measures mindfulness as a state-like phenomenon, that is evoked and maintained by regular practice.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=10}}
* The State Mindfulness Scale (SMS) is a 21-item survey with an overall state mindfulness scale, and 2 sub-scales (state mindfulness of mind, and state mindfulness of body).&lt;ref name="Tanay"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1037/a0034044 |pmid=24059475 |title= State Mindfulness Scale (SMS): Development and initial validation |journal= Psychological Assessment |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=1286–99 |year=2013 |last1=Tanay |first1=Galia |last2= Bernstein |first2=Amit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mindfulness-practice====
Mindfulness as a practice is described as:
* "Mindfulness is a way of paying attention that originated in Eastern meditation practices"&lt;ref&gt;Marlatt &amp; Kristeller, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;68&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally"&lt;ref name="Baer defines2"/&gt;
* "Bringing one’s complete attention to the present experience on a moment-to-moment basis"&lt;ref name="Baer defines2" /&gt;

According to Steven F. Hick, mindfulness practice involves both formal and informal meditation practices, and nonmeditation-based exercises.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}} Formal mindfulness, or meditation, is the practice of sustaining attention on body, breath or sensations, or whatever arises in each moment.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}} Informal mindfulness is the application of mindful attention in everyday life.{{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}} Nonmeditation-based exercises are specifically used in dialectical behavior therapy and in [[acceptance and commitment therapy]]. {{sfn|Hick|2010|p=6}}

====Two-component model====
In a paper that described a consensus among [[Clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]] on an operational and testable definition, Bishop, Lau, et al. (2004)&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/clipsy.bph077 |title=Mindfulness: A Proposed Operational Definition |journal= Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=230–41 |year=2006 |last1=Bishop |first1=Scott R. |last2=Lau |first2=Mark |last3=Shapiro |first3=Shauna |last4=Carlson |first4=Linda |last5= Anderson |first5=Nicole D. |last6=Carmody |first6=James |last7=Segal |first7=Zindel V. |last8=Abbey |first8=Susan |last9=Speca |first9=Michael |last10=Velting |first10=Drew |last11=Devins |first11=Gerald |citeseerx= 10.1.1.168.6212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a two-component model of mindfulness: 
{{quote|The first component involves the self-regulation of attention so that it is maintained on immediate experience, thereby allowing for increased recognition of mental events in the present moment. The second component involves adopting a particular orientation toward one’s experiences in the present moment, an orientation that is characterized by curiosity, openness, and acceptance.&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004" /&gt;{{rp|232}}}}

In this two-component model, self-regulated attention (the first component) "involves bringing [[awareness]] to current experience - observing and attending to the changing fields of "objects" (thoughts, feelings, sensations), from moment to moment – by regulating the focus of attention". Orientation to experience (the second component) involves maintaining an attitude of curiosity about objects experienced at each moment, and about where and how the mind wanders when it drifts from the selected focus of attention. Clients are asked to avoid trying to produce a particular state (e.g. relaxation), but rather to just notice each object that arises in the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]].&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004" /&gt;{{rp|233}}

====The five-aggregate model====
An ancient model of the mind, generally known as the five-aggregate model&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; enables one to understand the moment-to-moment manifestation of subjective conscious experience, and therefore can be a potentially useful theoretical resource to guide mindfulness interventions.

The five aggregates are described as follows:
# ''Material form:'' includes both the physical body and external matter where material elements are continuously moving to and from the material body.
# ''Feelings:'' can be pleasant, unpleasant or neutral.
# ''Perceptions:'' represent being aware of attributes of an object (e.g. color, shape, etc.)
# ''Volition:'' represents bodily, verbal, or psychological behavior.
# ''Sensory consciousness:'' refers to input from the five senses (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting or touch sensations) or a thought that happen to arise in the mind.

This model describes how sensory consciousness results in the generation of feelings, perception or volition, and how individuals’ previously conditioned attitudes and past associations influence this generation. The five aggregates are described as constantly arising and ceasing in the present moment.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

====Cultivating self-knowledge and wisdom====
The practice of mindfulness can be utilized to gradually develop self-knowledge and wisdom.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; In this regard, Buddhist teachings provide detailed instructions on how one can carry out an inquiry into the nature of the mind, and this guidance can help one to make sense of one’s subjective experience. This could include understanding what the “present moment” is, how various thoughts, etc., arise following input from the senses, the conditioned nature of thoughts, and other realizations.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; In Buddhist teachings, ultimate wisdom refers to gaining deep insight into all phenomena or “seeing things as they are.”&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

===Definitions arising in modern teaching of meditation===
Since the 1970s, most books on meditation use definitions of mindfulness similar to [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]]'s definition as "present moment awareness".  However, recently a number of teachers of meditation have proposed quite different definitions of mindfulness.  [[Shinzen Young]] says a person is mindful when they have mindful awareness, and defines that to be when "concentration power, sensory clarity, and equanimity [are] working together."&lt;ref&gt;From 'See, Hear, Feel: An Introduction', draft 1.8., https://www.shinzen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/SeeHearFeelIntroduction_ver1.8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Yates (Culadasa)]] defines mindfulness to be "the optimal interaction between attention and peripheral awareness", where he distinguishes attention and peripheral awareness as two distinct modes in which one may be conscious of things.&lt;ref&gt;p. 30, ''The Mind Illuminated'', Culadasa with Immergut and Graves, Hay House, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other usages===
The English term ''mindfulness'' already existed before it came to be used in a (western) Buddhist context. It was first recorded as ''myndfulness'' in 1530 ([[John Palsgrave]] translates French ''[[:wikt:pensée|pensée]]''), as ''mindfulnesse'' in 1561, and ''mindfulness'' in 1817. [[Morphology (linguistics) |Morphologically]] earlier terms include ''mindful'' (first recorded in 1340), ''mindfully'' (1382), and the obsolete ''mindiness'' (c. 1200).&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed., 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, mindfulness may also refer to "a state of being aware".&lt;ref group=web name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/mindfulness|title=Thesaurus results for 'Mindfulness' |website= www.merriam-webster.com |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms for this "state of being aware" are [[Wakefulness#Mindfulness |wakefulness]],{{sfn|Kabat-Zin|2011|pp=22–23}}{{sfn|Kabat-Zin|2013|p=65}} [[attention]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web |url= http://dico.isc.cnrs.fr/dico/en/search?b=1&amp;r=mindfulness&amp;send=Look+it+up|title=Component Selection for 'mindfulness' |website= dico.isc.cnrs.fr |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; alertness,&lt;ref group=web name="TC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thesaurus.com/browse/mindfulness|title=I found great synonyms for "mindfulness" on the new Thesaurus.com! |website= www.thesaurus.com |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; prudence,&lt;ref group=web name="TC" /&gt; conscientiousness,&lt;ref group=web name="TC" /&gt; awareness,&lt;ref group=web name="MW" /&gt; consciousness,&lt;ref group=web name="MW" /&gt; and observation.&lt;ref group=web name="MW" /&gt;

==Historical development==

===Buddhism===
Mindfulness as a modern, Western practice is founded on [[Zen]] and [[Vipassana movement|modern vipassana]],{{R|"Nisbet"}}&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;{{refn|group=note|Vipassana as taught by teachers from the [[Vipassana movement]] is a 19th century development, inspired by and reacting against Western modernism.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{sfn|Sharf|1995-B}} See also [[Buddhist modernism]].}} and involves the training of sati, which means "moment to moment awareness of present events", but also "remembering to be aware of something".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues/past-conferences/ml18 |title=The 18th Mind and Life Dialogues meeting |publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140322013413/http://www.mindandlife.org/dialogues/past-conferences/ml18/ |archivedate=22 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Early Buddhism====
''Sati'' is one of the [[bojjhanga|seven factors of enlightenment]]. "Correct" or "right" mindfulness (Pali: ''sammā-sati'', Sanskrit ''samyak-smṛti'') is the seventh element of the [[noble eightfold path]]. Mindfulness is an antidote to delusion and is considered as a 'power' (Pali: ''[[Five Strengths|bala]]'') which contributes to the attainment of ''[[nirvana]]''. This faculty becomes a power in particular when it is coupled with [[sampajañña|clear comprehension]] of whatever is taking place. Nirvana is a state of being in which greed, hatred and [[Avidya (Buddhism)|delusion]] (Pali: ''moha'') have been overcome and abandoned, and are absent from the mind.

According to Paul Williams, referring to Erich Frauwallner, mindfulness provided the way in early Buddhism to liberation, "constantly watching sensory experience in order to prevent the arising of cravings which would power future experience into rebirths."{{sfn|Williams|2000|p=46}}{{refn|group=note|name="Frauwallner"|Frauwallner, E. (1973), ''History of Indian Philosophy'', trans. V.M. Bedekar, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass. Two volumes., pp.150 ff}} According to Vetter, ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyana]]'' may have been the [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism#Contents and teachings of earliest Buddhism|original core practice of the Buddha]], which aided the maintenance of mindfulness.{{sfn|Vetter|1988}}

According to Rhys Davids, the doctrine of mindfulness is "perhaps the most important" after the [[Four Noble Truths]] and the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. T.W. Rhys Davids viewed the teachings of Gotama as a rational technique for self-actualization and rejected a few parts of it, mainly the doctrine of rebirth, as residual superstitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rhys Davids |first1=T.W. |title= Dialogues of the Buddha, Part II |date=1959 |orig-year=1910 |publisher=Pali Text Society |location= Oxford, Great Britain |isbn=0 86013 034 7 |pages= 322–346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zazen====
{{Main|Zazen|Shikantaza}}

The aim of [[zazen]] is just [[sitting]], that is, suspending all judgmental thinking and letting words, ideas, images and thoughts pass by without getting involved in them.&lt;ref name="hcz2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Warner|first=Brad|authorlink=Brad Warner|title=[[Hardcore Zen|Hardcore Zen: Punk Rock, Monster Movies, &amp; the Truth about Reality]]|publisher=[[Wisdom Publications]]|pages=189–190|year=2003|isbn= 086171380X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suzuki|first=Shunryū|authorlink=Shunryū Suzuki|title=[[Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind]]|pages=15–16|publisher=[[Shambhala Publications]]|year=2011|ISBN=978-159030849-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contemporary ''vipassana''-meditation====
In modern ''vipassana''-meditation, as propgated by the [[Vipassana movement]], ''sati'' aids ''vipassana'', [[Wisdom in Buddhism|insight]] into the true nature of reality, namely the [[three marks of existence]], the [[impermanence]] of and the [[dukkha|unsatisfactoriness]] of every conditioned thing that exists, and [[anatta|non-self]].&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Analayo_2003"/&gt; With this insight, the practitioner becomes a socalled ''[[Sotāpanna]]'', a "stream-enterer", the first stage on the [[Buddhist Paths to liberation|path to liberation]].&lt;ref name="Sister Ayya Khema"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khema/allofus.html |title=All of Us |accessdate= 2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight |last= Sister Ayya Khema}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html |title= The Noble Eightfold Path |accessdate= 2009-03-16 |publisher= Access to Insight |last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|In [[Mahayana]] contexts, it entails insight into what is variously described as [[sunyata]], [[dharmata]], the inseparability of appearance and emptiness ([[two truths doctrine]]), clarity and emptiness, or bliss and emptiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Defined by Reginald A.

Vipassana is practiced in tandem with [[samatha]], and also plays a central role in other Buddhist traditions.&lt;ref name="Analayo_2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anālayo |first1=Bhikku |title= Satipaṭṭhāna, the direct path to realization |date=2003 |publisher= Windhorse Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Theravada Buddhism?|url= http://www.accesstoinsight.org/theravada.html|work=Access to Insight |publisher= Access to Insight |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the contemporary Theravada orthodoxy, samatha is used as a preparation for vipassanā, pacifying the mind and strengthening the concentration in order to allow the work of insight, which leads to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism |liberation]].

Vipassanā-meditation has gained popularity in the west through the modern Buddhist vipassana movement, modeled after Theravāda Buddhism meditation practices,{{sfn|McMahan}} which employs vipassanā and [[anapana|ānāpāna]] meditation as its primary techniques and places emphasis on the teachings of the {{IAST|Satipaṭṭhāna}} Sutta.

=====Anapanasati, satipaṭṭhāna, and vipassana=====
[[Anapanasati]] is mindfulness of breathing. "Sati" means [[Mindfulness (Buddhism) |mindfulness]]; "ānāpāna" refers to inhalation and exhalation. Anapanasati means to feel the sensations caused by the movements of the breath in the body. The ''Anapanasati Sutta'' gives an exposition on this practice.{{refn|group=note|[[Majjhima Nikaya]] (MN), sutta number 118. See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.118.than.html Thanissaro, 2006]. Other discourses which describe the full four tetrads can be found in the [[Samyutta Nikaya]]'s ''Anapana-samyutta'' (Ch. 54), such as SN 54.6 (Thanissaro, 2006a), SN 54.8 (Thanissaro, 2006b) and SN 54.13 (Thanissaro, 1995a). The one-tetrad exposition of anapanasati is found, for instance, in the ''Kayagata-sati Sutta'' ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 119; Thanissaro, 1997), the ''Maha-satipatthana Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 22; Thanissaro, 2000) and the ''[[Satipatthana Sutta]]'' (MN 10; Thanissaro, 1995b).}}

[[Satipaṭṭhāna]] is the establishment of mindfulness in one's day-to-day life, maintaining as much as possible a calm awareness of one's body, feelings, mind, and [[dharma]]s. The practice of mindfulness supports analysis resulting in the arising of wisdom (Pali: ''paññā'', Sanskrit: ''prajñā'').&lt;ref name="Analayo_2003"/&gt;

=====''Samprajaña'', ''apramāda'' and ''atappa''=====
In contemporary Theravada practice, "mindfulness" also includes ''samprajaña'', meaning "clear comprehension" and ''apramāda'' meaning "vigilance".&lt;ref name="Subhuti"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madhyamavani.fwbo.org/8/mindfulness.html |title=Friends of the Western Buddhist Order (FWBO): Buddhism and Mindfulness |first= |last=Satyadarshin |website= madhyamavani.fwbo.org |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[I]n Buddhist discourse, there are three terms that together map the field of mindfulness [...] [in their Sanskrit variants] ''smṛti'' (Pali: ''sati''), ''samprajaña'' (Pali: ''[[Sampajañña]]'')  and ''[[apramāda]]'' (Pali: ''appamada'').&lt;ref name="Subhuti" /&gt;}} All three terms are sometimes (confusingly) translated as "mindfulness", but they all have specific shades of meaning.

In a publicly available correspondence between [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] and [[B. Alan Wallace]], Bodhi has described Ven. [[Nyanaponika Thera]]'s views on "right mindfulness" and sampajañña as follows:
{{quote|He held that in the proper practice of right mindfulness, sati has to be integrated with sampajañña, clear comprehension, and it is only when these two work together that right mindfulness can fulfill its intended purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://shamatha.org/sites/default/files/Bhikkhu_Bodhi_Correspondence.pdf |title="The Nature of Mindfulness and Its Role in Buddhist Meditation" A Correspondence between B.A. wallace and the Venerable Bikkhu Bodhi, Winter 2006, p.4 |publisher= |accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note| According to this correspondence, Ven. Nyanaponika spend his last ten years living with and being cared for by Bodhi. Bodhi refers to Nyanaponika as "my closest kalyāṇamitta in my life as a monk."}}}}

====Monitoring mental processes====
According to Buddhadasa, the aim of mindfulness is to stop the arising of disturbing thoughts and emotions, which arise from sense-contact.{{sfn|Buddhadasa Bhikkhu|2014|p=79, 101, 117 note 42}}

According to Grzegorz Polak, the four ''upassanā'' (foundations of mindfulness) have been misunderstood by the developing Buddhist tradition, including Theravada, to refer to four different foundations. According to Polak, the four ''upassanā'' do not refer to four different foundations, but to the awareness of four different aspects of raising mindfulness:{{sfn|Polak|2011}}
* the [[Ayatana|six sense-bases]] which one needs to be aware of (''kāyānupassanā''); 
* contemplation on [[vedanā]]s, which arise with the contact between the senses and their objects (''vedanānupassanā'');
* the altered states of mind to which this practice leads (cittānupassanā);
* the development from the [[five hindrances]]  to the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''dhammānupassanā'').}}

===Transcendentalism===
Kabat-Zinn himself refers to Thoreau as a predecessor of the interest in mindfulness, together with the other eminent [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalists]] Emerson and Whitman:{{sfn|Kabat-Zinn|year unknown}}
{{quote|The collective experience{{refn|group=note|The resort to "experience" as the ground for religious truths is a strategy which goes back to Schleiermacher, as a defense against the growing influence of western rationality on the religious life of Europeans in the 19th century.

But this view is neither particularly "Eastern" nor mystical.

The forms of Asian religion and spirituality which were introduced in the west were themselves influenced by Transcendentalism and other 19th-century manifestations of [[Western esotericism]]. Transcendentalism was closely connected to the Unitarian Church,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}}&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finseth|first1=Ian Frederick |title= The Emergence of Transcendentalism |url= http://xroads.virginia.edu/~ma95/finseth/trans.html |website= virginia.edu |publisher=The University of Virginia |accessdate= 9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in India collaborated with [[Ram Mohan Roy]] (1772–1833) and his [[Brahmo Samaj]].{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} He found that [[Unitarianism]] came closest to true Christianity,{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=268}} and had a strong sympathy for the Unitarians.{{sfn|Kipf|1979|p=3-8}} This influence worked through on [[Vivekananda]], whose modern but idiosyncratic interpretation of Hinduism became widely popular in the west.{{sfn|King|2001}} Vipassana meditation, presented as a centuries-old meditation system, was a 19th-century reinvention,{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=22}} which gained popularity in south-east due to the accessibility of the Buddhist sutras through English translations from the Pali Text Society.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} It was brought to western attention in the 19th century by the [[Theosophical Society]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=17}} Zen Buddhism first gained popularity in the west through the writings of [[D.T.

===Jon Kabat-Zinn and MBSR===
In 1979, [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] founded the [[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction]] (MBSR) program at the [[University of Massachusetts]] to treat the chronically ill.&lt;ref&gt;"The Stress Reduction Program, founded by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979..." - http://www.umassmed.edu/cfm/stress/index.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This program sparked the application of mindfulness ideas and practices in Medicine&lt;ref&gt;"Much of the interest in the clinical applications of mindfulness has been sparked by the introduction of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), a manualized treatment program originally developed for the management of chronic pain (Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, &amp; Burney, 1985; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, Burney, &amp; Sellers, 1987)." - Bishop et al, 2004, "Mindfulness: A Proposed Operational Definition"&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|230–1}} for the treatment of a variety of conditions in both healthy and unhealthy people. MBSR and similar programs are now widely applied in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments.

Mindfulness practices were inspired mainly by teachings from the [[Eastern World]], particularly from Buddhist traditions. Kabat-Zinn himself was first introduced to meditation by [[Philip Kapleau]], a [[Zen]] missionary who came to speak at MIT where Kabat-Zinn was a student. Kabat-Zinn went on to study meditation with other Zen-Buddhist teachers such as [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] and [[Seungsahn]].&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book |first=Jeff |last=Wilson |title=Mindful America: The Mutual Transformation of Buddhist Meditation and American Culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied at the [[Insight Meditation Society]] and eventually taught there.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;One of MBSR's techniques - the "body scan" - was derived from a meditation practice ("sweeping") of the Burmese [[U Ba Khin]] tradition, as taught by [[S. N. Goenka]] in his [[Vipassana]] retreats, which he began in 1976. It has since been widely adapted in secular settings, independent of religious or cultural contexts.{{refn|group=note|name="jama.ama-assn.org"|"Historically a Buddhist practice, mindfulness can be considered a universal human capacity proposed to foster clear thinking and open-heartedness. As such, this form of meditation requires no particular religious or cultural belief system." - Mindfulness in Medicine by Ludwig and Kabat-Zinn, available at [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/300/11/1350 jama.ama-assn.org]}}{{refn|group=note|"Kabat-Zinn (2000) suggests that mindfulness practice may be beneficial to many people in Western society who might be unwilling to adopt Buddhist traditions or vocabulary.

===Popularization, "mindfulness movement"===
Mindfulness is gaining a growing popularity as a practice in daily life, apart from Buddhist insight meditation and its application in clinical psychology.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt; In this context mindfulness is defined as moment-by-moment awareness of thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surrounding environment, characterized mainly by "acceptance" - attention to thoughts and feelings without judging whether they are right or wrong. Mindfulness focuses the human brain on what is being sensed at each moment, instead of on its normal [[Rumination (psychology) |rumination]] on the past or on the future.&lt;ref name="What Is Mindfulness"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/topic/mindfulness/definition |title= What Is Mindfulness?|website= The Greater Good Science Center |publisher= The Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley |accessdate= 2014-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mindfulness'' may be seen as a mode of being,&lt;ref name="Israel"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ira-israel/types-of-mindfulness_b_3347428.html |title= What's the Difference Between Mindfulness, Mindfulness Meditation and Basic Meditation? |website= The Huffington Post |date= 30 May 2013 |last= Israel |first= Ira}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be practiced outside a formal setting.&lt;ref name="Bernhard"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/turning-straw-gold/201106/6-benefits-practicing-mindfulness-outside-meditation |title= 6 Benefits of Practicing Mindfulness Outside of Meditation |date= 6 Jun 2011 |website= Psychology Today |last= Bernhard |first= Toni}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terminology used by scholars of religion, scientists, journalists, and popular media writers to describe this movement of mindfulness "popularization," and the many new contexts of mindfulness practice which have cropped up, has regularly evolved over the past 20 years, with some criticisms arising.&lt;ref name="Valerio 1–27"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1080/14639947.2016.1162425 |title= Owning Mindfulness: A Bibliometric Analysis of Mindfulness Literature Trends Within and Outside of Buddhist Contexts |journal= Contemporary Buddhism |volume=17 |pages= 157–83 |year=2016 |last1= Valerio |first1=Adam }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Therapy programs===

====Mindfulness-based stress reduction====
{{Main article|Mindfulness-based stress reduction}}

Mindfulness-based stress reduction ('''MBSR''') is a mindfulness-based program&lt;ref name=MBSRwebsite&gt;{{cite web |title= What is Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction? |publisher= Mindful Living Programs |url=http://www.mindfullivingprograms.com/whatMBSR.php |accessdate=April 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060718065653/http://www.mindfullivingprograms.com/whatMBSR.php |archivedate= July 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and [[Yoga as exercise or alternative medicine|yoga]] to help people become more mindful.&lt;ref name=" Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt; While MBSR has its roots in spiritual teachings, the program itself is [[Secularism|secular]].&lt;ref name="Kabat-Zinn_2013"/&gt;

====Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy====
{{Main article|Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy}}

Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) is a [[psychological therapy]] designed to aid in preventing the relapse of depression, specifically in individuals with [[Major depressive disorder]] (MDD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.05.002 |pmid= 21802618 |title=The effect of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for prevention of relapse in recurrent major depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis |journal= Clinical Psychology Review |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages= 1032–40 |year=2011 |last1=Piet |first1=Jacob |last2= Hougaard |first2=Esben }}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses traditional [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) methods and adds in newer psychological strategies such as mindfulness and mindfulness meditation. Cognitive methods can include educating the participant about depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.jad.2010.09.027 |pmid=21093925 |title= Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy vs cognitive behaviour therapy as a treatment for non-melancholic depression |journal= Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=130 |issue=1–2 |pages=138–44 |year=2011 |last1= Manicavasgar |first1= Vijaya |last2=Parker |first2=Gordon |last3=Perich |first3=Tania }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness and mindfulness meditation, focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.psc.2010.04.006 |pmid=20599141 |pmc=2898899 |title=The Empirical Status of the "New Wave" of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy |journal= Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume= 33 |issue=3 |pages=701–10 |year=2010 |last1= Hofmann |first1=Stefan G |last2=Sawyer |first2= Alice T |last3=Fang |first3=Angela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like CBT, MBCT functions on the theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode.&lt;ref name="Felder"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jclp.21832 |pmid=23616298 |title= Collaboration in Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=179–86 |year=2012 |last1=Felder |first1=Jennifer N |last2= Dimidjian |first2=Sona |last3=Segal |first3=Zindel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of MBCT is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment.&lt;ref name="Felder" /&gt; This mindfulness practice allows the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. 
Research supports the effects of MBCT in people who have been depressed three or more times and demonstrates reduced relapse rates by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1037/0022-006x.72.1.31 |pmid=14756612 |title= Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression: Replication and Exploration of Differential Relapse Prevention Effects |journal= Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=72 |issue=1 |pages=31–40 |year=2004 |last1=Ma |first1=S.

====Acceptance and commitment therapy====
{{Main article|Acceptance and commitment therapy}}

Acceptance and commitment therapy or (ACT) (typically pronounced as the word "act") is a form of [[clinical behavior analysis]] (CBA)&lt;ref name="Plumb"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid= 22478515 |pmc=2686995 |year=2009 |author1= Plumb |first1=J.

====Dialectical behavior therapy====
Mindfulness is a "core" exercise used in [[dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), a psychosocial treatment [[Marsha M. Linehan]] developed for treating people with [[borderline personality disorder]]. DBT is [[dialectic]], explains Linehan,&lt;ref&gt;Linehan 1993, p.19&lt;/ref&gt; in the sense of "the reconciliation of opposites in a continual process of synthesis." As a practitioner of Buddhist meditation techniques, Linehan says:
{{quote|This emphasis in DBT on a balance of acceptance and change owes much to my experiences in studying meditation and Eastern spirituality. The DBT tenets of observing, mindfulness, and avoidance of judgment are all derived from the study and practice of Zen meditations.&lt;ref&gt;Linehan 1993, p.20-21&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Mode deactivation therapy====
[[Mode deactivation therapy]] (MDT) is a treatment methodology that is derived from the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy and incorporates elements of Acceptance and commitment therapy, Dialectical behavior therapy, and mindfulness techniques.&lt;ref name=MDT_Book&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Apsche JA, DiMeo L |title= Mode Deactivation Therapy for aggression and oppositional behavior in adolescents: An integrative methodology using ACT, DBT, and CBT |year=2010 |publisher= New Harbinger |location= Oakland, CA  |isbn= 978-1608821075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness techniques such as simple breathing exercises are applied to assist the client in awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of unpleasant and distressing thoughts and feelings as they occur in the present moment. Mode Deactivation Therapy was developed and is established as an effective treatment for adolescents with problem behaviors and complex trauma-related psychological problems, according to recent publications by [[Jack A.

Since 2006, research supports promising mindfulness-based therapies for a number of medical and psychiatric conditions, notably [[chronic pain]] (McCracken et al. 2007), [[Stress (biological)|stress]] (Grossman et al. 2004), anxiety and depression (Hofmann et al. 2010), [[substance abuse]] (Melemis 2008:141-157), and recurrent [[suicidal behavior]] (Williams et al. 2006). Bell (2009) gives a brief overview of mindful approaches to therapy, particularly [[family therapy]], starting with a discussion of [[mysticism]] and emphasizing the value of a mindful therapist.

;Morita therapy
The Japanese psychiatrist [[Shoma Morita]], who trained in Zen meditation, developed [[Morita therapy]] upon principles of mindfulness and non-attachment. Since the beginnings of [[Gestalt therapy]] in the early 1940s, mindfulness, referred to as "awareness", has been an essential part of its theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Gestalt theory concepts |url= http://www.gestalttheory.com/concepts |accessdate= 25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools===
In 2012 Congressman [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]] of Ohio published ''A Mindful Nation'', and has received a $1 million federal grant to teach mindfulness in schools in his home district.&lt;ref name=Time2014/&gt;

[[Mindful Kids Miami, Inc.(MKM)]] is a tax-exempt, 501 (c)(3), non-profit corporation established in 2011 and dedicated to making age-appropriate mindfulness training available to school children in Miami-Dade County public and private schools. This is primarily accomplished by training educators and other child care providers to incorporate mindfulness practices in the children’s daily activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.Mindfulkidsmiami.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, [[Susan Kaiser Greenland#Work|The Inner Kids Program]], a mindfulness-based program developed for children, was introduced into public and private school curricula in the greater Los Angeles area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.susankaisergreenland.com/inner-kids.html&lt;/ref&gt;

MindUP, a classroom-based program spearheaded by [[Goldie Hawn]]'s Hawn Foundation, teaches students to self-regulate behavior and mindfully engage in focused concentration required for academic success. For the last decade, MindUP has trained teachers in over 1,000 schools in cities from Arizona to Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thehawnfoundation.org/mindup/ |title= MindUP™ |accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holistic Life Foundation, a non-profit organization that created an in-school mindfulness program called Mindful Moment, is currently serving almost 350 students daily at Robert W. Coleman Elementary School and approximately 1300 students at Patterson Park High School in Baltimore, Maryland. At Patterson High School, the Mindful Moment program engages the school's faculty along with the students during a 15-minute mindfulness practice at the beginning and end of each school day.

Mindful Life Project, a non-profit 501(c)3 based out of Richmond, California, teaches mindfulness to elementary school students in underserved schools in the South Richmond school district. Utilizing curriculum, “Rise-Up” is a regular school day intervention program serving 430 students weekly, while “Mindful Community” is currently implemented at six South Richmond partner schools. These in-school mindfulness programs have been endorsed by Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, who has recommended additional funding to expand the program in order to serve all Richmond youth.

=== Education ===
Mindfulness practices are becoming more common within educational institutions including [[Elementary school (United States)|Elementary]] and [[Secondary school|Secondary]] schools.

Renshaw and Cook state, “As scientific interest in the utility of Mindfulness-Based Intervention (MBI) in schools grew steadily, popular interest in mindfulness in schools seemed to grow exponentially”.&lt;ref name="Renshaw, T. L. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pits.21978 |title=Introduction to the Special Issue: Mindfulness in the Schools-Historical Roots, Current Status, and Future Directions |journal=Psychology in the Schools |volume=54 |pages=5–12 |year=2017 |last1=Renshaw |first1=Tyler L |last2=Cook |first2=Clayton R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite research on mindfulness being comparatively unexamined, especially with young students, the practice has seen a spike in use within the educational arena. “A relatively recent addition to discourse around preventing school expulsion and failure, mindfulness is gaining popularity for its potential to improve students’ social, emotional, behavioral, and learning-related cognitive control, thereby improving academic outcomes”.&lt;ref name="Eklund, K. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pits.21983 |title=Gauging Mindfulness in Children and Youth: School-Based Applications |journal=Psychology in the Schools |volume=54 |pages=101–14 |year=2017 |last1=Eklund |first1=Katie |last2=O'Malley |first2=Meagan |last3=Meyer |first3=Lauren }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers and educators are interested in how mindfulness can provide optimal conditions for a students’ personal development and academic success. Current research on mindfulness in education is limited but can provide insight to the potential benefits for students, and areas of improvement for future studies.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mindfulness in the classroom is being touted as a promising new intervention tool for young students. According to Choudhury and Moses, “Although still marginal and in some cases controversial, secular programs of mindfulness have been implemented with ambitious goals of improving attentional focus of pupils, social-emotional learning in “at-risk” children and youth, not least, to intervene in problems of poverty and incarceration”.&lt;ref name="Choudhury &amp; Moses 2016"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0959354316669025 |title=Mindful interventions: Youth, poverty, and the developing brain |journal=Theory &amp; Psychology |volume=26 |issue=5 |pages=591–606 |year=2016 |last1=Choudhury |first1=Suparna |last2=Moses |first2=Joshua M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emerging research is concerned with studying teachers and programs using mindfulness practices with students, and is discovering tension arising from the moral reframing of eastern practices in western school settings. As cited by Renshaw and Cook, “Unlike most other approaches to contemporary school-based intervention, which are squarely grounded in behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and ecological systems theories, MBIs have their origins in Eastern religious traditions”.&lt;ref name="Renshaw, T. L. 2016"/&gt; Some school administrators are concerned about implementing such practices, and parents have been reported to take their children out of mindfulness programs because of their personal religious beliefs.  Yet, MBI’s continue to be accepted by the mainstream in both primary and secondary schools because, “Mindfulness practices, particularly in relationship to children who might otherwise be considered broken or unredeemable, fill a critical niche – one that allows its advocates to imagine a world where people can change, become more compassionate, resilient, reflective, and aware; a world with a viable future”.&lt;ref name="Choudhury &amp; Moses 2016"/&gt; As mindfulness in education continues to develop, ethical consequences will remain a controversial issue because the generic description for the “benefits” and “results” of MBI’s are largely concerned with individual and inward-focused achievement, rather than the original Buddhist ideal of global human connection.

Available research reveals a relationship between mindfulness and attention. Semple, Lee, Rosa, &amp; Miller argue, “Anxiety can impair attention and promote emotionally reactive behaviors that interfere with the development of good study skills, so it seems reasonable that increased mindfulness would be associated with less anxiety”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10826-009-9301-y |title=A Randomized Trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children: Promoting Mindful Attention to Enhance Social-Emotional Resiliency in Children |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=218–29 |year=2009 |last1=Semple |first1=Randye J |last2=Lee |first2=Jennifer |last3=Rosa |first3=Dinelia |last4=Miller |first4=Lisa F }}&lt;/ref&gt; They conducted a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) that found promise in managing anxiety for elementary school-aged children, and suggests that those who completed the program displayed fewer attention problems. In addition, Flook shows how an eight-week mindfulness awareness program was evaluated in a random and controlled school setting, and measured the effects of awareness practices on executive functions in elementary school children. Their findings concluded, “Participation in the mindfulness awareness program was associated with improvements in behavioral regulation, metacognition, and overall executive functions”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/15377900903379125 |title=Effects of Mindful Awareness Practices on Executive Functions in Elementary School Children |journal=Journal of Applied School Psychology |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=70–95 |year=2010 |last1=Flook |first1=Lisa |last2=Smalley |first2=Susan L |last3=Kitil |first3=M.

These perspectives are a valuable source of data given that caregivers and educators interact with the children daily and across a variety of settings. According to Eklund, Omalley, and Meyer, “School-based practitioners should find promise in the evidence supporting mindfulness-based practices with children, parents, and educators”.&lt;ref name="Eklund, K. 2016"/&gt; Lastly, a third study by Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz, and Walach concluded, “Analysis suggest that mindfulness-based interventions for children and youths are able to increase cognitive capacity of attending and learning by nearly one standard deviation and yield”.&lt;ref name="Zenner, Herrnleben-Kurz &amp; Walach 2014"/&gt; Application of Mindfulness-Based Interventions continue to increase in popularity and practice.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mindfulness-Based Interventions are rising across western culture, but its effectiveness in school programs is still being determined. Research contends, “Mindfulness-based approaches for adults are effective at enhancing mental health, but few controlled trials have evaluated their effectiveness among young people”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.113.126649 |pmid=23787061 |title=Effectiveness of the Mindfulness in Schools Programme: Non-randomised controlled feasibility study |journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry |volume=203 |issue=2 |pages=126–31 |year=2013 |last1=Kuyken |first1=W |last2=Weare |first2=K |last3=Ukoumunne |first3=O.

A firmly controlled experiment, Johnson, Burke, Brinkman, and Wade evaluated “the impact of an existing and widely available school-based mindfulness program, no improvements were demonstrated on any outcome measured either immediately post intervention or at three-month follow-up”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2016.03.002 |pmid=27054828 |title=Effectiveness of a school-based mindfulness program for transdiagnostic prevention in young adolescents |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=81 |pages=1–11 |year=2016 |last1=Johnson |first1=Catherine |last2=Burke |first2=Christine |last3=Brinkman |first3=Sally |last4=Wade |first4=Tracey }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many questions remain on which practices best implement effective and reliable mindfulness programs at schools, and further research is needed to identify the optimal methods and measurement tools for mindfulness in education.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Mindfulness has gained increasing empirical attention since 1970.&lt;ref name="Harrington2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to a 2015 [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]] of systematic reviews of [[Randomized controlled trial|RCT]]s (that included a combined total of 8683 participants consisting of different patient categories as well as healthy adults and children), evidence supports the use of mindfulness programs to alleviate symptoms of a variety of [[mental disorder|mental]] and physical disorders.&lt;ref name="Gotink"/&gt; Other reviews report similar findings.&lt;ref name="Sharma"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sequeira"/&gt;

==Concerns and criticism==

===Scholarly research===
Many of the above cited review studies however also indicate the necessity for more high-quality research in this field such as conducting intervention studies using larger sample sizes, the use of more randomized controlled studies and the need for providing more methodological details in reported studies.&lt;ref name="Creswell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Keng2011"/&gt; There are also a few review studies that have found little difference between mindfulness interventions and control groups, though they did also indicate that their intervention group was treated too shortly for the research to be conclusive.&lt;ref name= McLean2017 &gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/s12883-017-0876-4 |pmid=28506263 |pmc=5433018 |title=Mindfulness-based stress reduction in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review |journal=BMC Neurology |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=92 |year=2017 |last1=McLean |first1=G |last2=Lawrence |first2=M |last3=Simpson |first3=R |last4=Mercer |first4=S.

Various scholars have criticized how mindfulness has been defined or represented in recent western psychology publications.&lt;ref name="bishopetal2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wallace06"&gt;{{cite book |title=The attention revolution: Unlocking the power of the focused mind |last=Wallace |first=B.

These modern understandings depart significantly from the accounts of mindfulness in early Buddhist texts and authoritative commentaries in the Theravada and Indian Mahayana traditions.&lt;ref name="wallace06" /&gt;{{rp|62}}&lt;ref name="chiesa13"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12671-012-0123-4 |title=The Difficulty of Defining Mindfulness: Current Thought and Critical Issues |journal=Mindfulness |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=255–68 |year=2012 |last1=Chiesa |first1=Alberto }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Valerio has introduced the idea that conflict between academic disciplines over how mindfulness is defined, understood, and popularly presented may be indicative of a personal, institutional, or paradigmatic battle for ownership over mindfulness, one where academics, researchers, and other writers are invested as individuals in much the same way as religious communities.&lt;ref name="Valerio 1–27"/&gt;

===Shortcomings===
The popularization of mindfulness as a "commodity"{{sfn|Safran|2014}} has been criticized, being termed "McMindfulness" by some critics.&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ron-purser/beyond-mcmindfulness_b_3519289.html Ron Purser and David Loy (2013), ''Beyond McMindfulness'', Huffington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name="TriMc"&gt;[http://tricycle.org/trikedaily/trike-contributing-editor-david-loy-takes-mcmindfulness/ Alex Caring-Lobel (2013), ''Trike Contributing Editor David Loy takes on "McMindfulness" '', Tricycle Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bazzano|2014}} According to Safran, the popularity of mindfulness is the result of a marketing strategy:{{sfn|Safran|2014}}
"McMindfulness is the marketing of a constructed dream; an idealized lifestyle; an identity makeover."{{sfn|Safran|2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/677842 |title=Creating the Responsible Consumer: Moralistic Governance Regimes and Consumer Subjectivity |year=2014 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus|last2=Veresiu |first2=Ela |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=41 |issue=October |pages=849–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safran, Jeremy D., PhD.

According to Purser and Loy, mindfulness is not being used as a means to awaken to insight in the "unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion,"&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; but reshaped into a "banal, therapeutic, self-help technique" that has the opposite effect of reinforcing those passions.&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; While mindfulness is marketed as a means to reduce stress, in a Buddhist context it is part of an all-embracing ethical program to foster "wise action, social harmony, and compassion."&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; The privatization of mindfulness neglects the societal and organizational causes of stress and discomfort, instead propagating adaptation to these circumstances.&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, "[A]bsent a sharp social critique, Buddhist practices could easily be used to justify and stabilize the status quo, becoming a reinforcement of [[consumer capitalism]]."&lt;ref group=web name="McMindfulness" /&gt; The popularity of this new brand of mindfulness has resulted in the commercialization of meditation through self-help books, guided meditation classes, and mindfulness retreats.

Buddhist commentators have criticized the movement as being presented as equivalent to Buddhist practice, while in reality it is very possibly denatured with undesirable consequences, such as being ungrounded in the traditional reflective morality and therefore, astray from traditional Buddhist ethics. Criticisms suggest it to be either de-moralized or re-moralized into clinically based ethics. The conflict is often presented in concern to the teacher's credentials and qualifications, rather than the student's actual practice. Reformed Buddhist-influenced practices are being standardized and manualized in a clearly distinct separation from Buddhism seen as a religion based in monastic temples, as expressed as mindfulness in a new psychology ethic practiced in modern meditation centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shonin|first1=Edo|title=Buddhist Foundations of Mindfulness (Mindfulness in Behavioral Health)|date=August 27, 2015|publisher=Springer|pages=90–94|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

In the law of [[contract]]s, the '''mirror image rule,''' also referred to as an unequivocal and absolute acceptance requirement, states that an [[offer and acceptance|offer]] must be accepted exactly with no modifications. The offeror is the master of one's own offer. An attempt to accept the offer on different terms instead creates a [[counter-offer]], and this constitutes a rejection of the original offer.&lt;ref&gt;(Restatement(2d) Contracts §59)&lt;/ref&gt;

==England==
The [[English common law]] established the concepts of ''[[consensus ad idem]]'', offer, acceptance and counter-offer.  The leading case on counter-offer is ''[[Hyde v Wrench]]'' [1840].&lt;ref&gt; Hyde v Wrench [1840] EWHC Ch J90&lt;/ref&gt;   The phrase "Mirror-Image Rule" is rarely (if at all) used by English lawyers; but the concept remains valid, as in ''[[Gibson v Manchester City Council]]'' [1979],&lt;ref&gt;Gibson v Manchester City Council [1979] UKHL 6|&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-Cell-O Corp Ltd|Butler Machine Tool v Excello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Butler Machine Tool Co Ltd v Ex-cello Cpn (England) Ltd 1979 1 WLR 401 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
This position is adhered to in [[Australia]] ([[New South Wales]]). If a person were to accept an offer, but make a modification, then they are actually rejecting the offer presented to them and are proposing a counter-offer: ''Masters v Cameron'' (1954) 91 CLR 353. That modifying party is then the one making a new offer, and the original offeror is now the one who has to accept.

==United States==
{{See also|United States contract law#UCC .C2.A7 2-207|Uniform Commercial Code#Section 2-207: Battle of the forms|Offer and acceptance#Battle of the forms}}

In the [[United States]], this rule still exists at common law.  However, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] ("UCC") dispenses with it in § 2-207. (but it can also be argued that § 2-207(1) enforces the mirror image rule)&lt;ref&gt;Text of § 2-207: https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/article2.htm#s2-207&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, its applicability depends upon what law governs.  Most states have adopted the UCC, which governs transactions in goods.  Contracts for services or land, for example, would not be governed by the UCC.  The 2nd restatement of contracts also provides that when parties have not agreed to an essential term, "a term which is reasonable in the circumstances is supplied by the court."  However, it may not be possible for a reasonable term to be supplied by the court.

'''Personality judgment''' (or '''personality judgement''') is the process by which people perceive each other's personalities through acquisition of certain information about others, or meeting others in person. The purpose of studying personality judgment is to understand past behavior exhibited by individuals and predict future behavior. Theories concerning personality judgment focus on the accuracy of personality judgments and the effects of personality judgments on various aspects of social interactions.&lt;ref name="Funder1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Funder|first1=David C.|year=1995|title=On the accuracy of personality judgment: A realistic approach.|journal=Psychological Review|volume=102|issue=4|pages=652–670|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.102.4.652|issn=0033-295X|pmid=7480467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining how people judge personality is important because personality judgments often influence individuals' behaviors.&lt;ref name="SnyderKlein2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=Mark|last2=Klein|first2=Olivier|title=Construing and constructing others: On the reality and the generality of the behavioral confirmation scenario|journal=Interaction Studies|volume=6|issue=1|year=2005|pages=53–67|issn=1572-0373|doi=10.1075/is.6.1.05sny}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Accuracy==

===Perspectives on accuracy===

Research on the accuracy of personality judgments varies based on three major perspectives on the basis of accurate personality judgment.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Funder | first1 = D. C. | last2 = West | first2 = S. G. | year = 1993 | title = Consensus, self-other agreement, and accuracy in personality judgment: An introduction | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 61 | issue = 4| pages = 457–476 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1993.tb00778.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These perspectives vary based on the criteria used to determine accuracy.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt;
 
*Pragmatism: The pragmatic perspective on accuracy suggests that people will only perceive aspects of personality that they can use when interacting with others.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; The personality judgments are deemed accurate when they are useful in future interactions.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt;
*Constructivism: The constructivist perspective on accuracy suggests that there is no objective, accurate measure of personality judgment.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; People may make differing personality judgments of the same person based on their unique perspectives of the judged person.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; According to constructivists, each judgment is equally correct. Thus, rather than focusing on accuracy of judgments, these researchers focus on the different methods and perspectives through which people make personality judgments.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; 
*Realism: The realistic perspective on personality judgment assumes that there is an objective reality in personality that can be measured empirically.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; Realists believe that personality judgments may be verified for accuracy by determining whether the judgments predict the target individual's behaviors.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt; Accuracy may also be verified by agreement of personality judgments among several independent judges.&lt;ref name="FunderWest"/&gt;

===Contributors to accurate personality judgment===
A variety of variables contribute to the accuracy or inaccuracy of personality judgment in systematic ways. These variables include characteristics of the individual whose [[personality]] is being judged as well as characteristics of the individual who is judging personality.&lt;ref&gt;Funder, D.C. (2010). The personality puzzle. New York: W.W. Norton and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judge characteristics====
Characteristics of the individual judging personality that contribute to accuracy include the following:
*[[Gender]] and ethnic similarity to target&lt;ref name="Letzring"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Letzring | first1 = T. D. | year = 2010 | title = The effects of judge-target gender and ethnicity similarity on the accuracy of personality judgments | url = | journal = Social Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = 1| pages = 42–51 | doi = 10.1027/1864-9335/a000007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**A person is more likely to make an accurate personality judgment when the individual they are judging has the same gender and ethnicity as the judge.&lt;ref name="Letzring"/&gt;
*[[Stereotype]] knowledge and utilization,&lt;ref name="Chan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chan | first1 = W. | last2 = Mendelsohn | first2 = G. A. | year = 2010 | title = Disentangling stereotype and person effects: Do social stereotypes bias observer judgment of personality? . | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 44 | issue = 2| pages = 251–257 | doi = 10.1016/j.jrp.2010.02.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**When judges are only aware of the target's group membership, judges are likely to base personality judgments on their knowledge of stereotypes concerning the relevant group.&lt;ref name="Chan"/&gt; However, these effects are much stronger for gender stereotypes than ethnic stereotypes, such that even when abundant information about the target is available, judges will base personality judgment on gender stereotypes but not ethnic stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Chan"/&gt; 
*Relationship to the target individual &lt;ref name="Connelly"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Connelly | first1 = B. S. | last2 = Ones | first2 = D. S. | year = 2010 | title = An other perspective on personality: Meta-analytic integration of observers' accuracy and predictive validity | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 136 | issue = 6| pages = 1092–1122 | doi = 10.1037/a0021212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Judges who are acquainted with the target individual typically provide more accurate personality judgments, presumably due to their knowledge of the individual across different types of situations.&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;
*Number of judges&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;
**Although one judge may provide an accurate personality judgment, the average of multiple judgments from different individuals more strongly predicts behavior than judgments from one individual.&lt;ref name="Connelly"/&gt;
*Sex of the judge&lt;ref name="Letzring"/&gt;
**Females typically provide more accurate personality judgments than males.&lt;ref name="Letzring"/&gt;

====Target characteristics====
Characteristics of the target individual that are important for accurate personality judgment include the following:
*Visibility of the [[trait theory|trait]] in question&lt;ref name="FunderDobroth1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Funder|first1=David C.|last2=Dobroth|first2=Kathryn M.|title=Differences between traits: Properties associated with interjudge agreement.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=52|issue=2|year=1987|pages=409–418|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.2.409}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Traits that are more readily observable are more likely to elicit accurate judgments.&lt;ref name="FunderDobroth1987"/&gt; [[Extraversion]] is typically considered a more visible trait, whereas [[neuroticism]] is considered a less visible trait.&lt;ref name="FunderDobroth1987"/&gt; 
*Psychological adjustment of the target individual&lt;ref name="HumanBiesanz2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Human|first1=Lauren J.|last2=Biesanz|first2=Jeremy C.|title=Target adjustment and self-other agreement: Utilizing trait observability to disentangle judgeability and self-knowledge.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=101|issue=1|year=2011|pages=202–216|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/a0023782|pmid=21604892}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
**Individuals who are well-adjusted are more likely to elicit accurate personality judgments.&lt;ref name="HumanBiesanz2011"/&gt; Well-adjusted individuals reveal more about their personality to those they interact with, thus making it easier for others to judge them accurately.&lt;ref name="HumanBiesanz2011"/&gt;
*Amount of personal disclosure&lt;ref name="BeerBrooks2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beer|first1=Andrew|last2=Brooks|first2=Cody|title=Information quality in personality judgment: The value of personal disclosure|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=45|issue=2|year=2011|pages=175–185|issn=0092-6566|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2011.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**Targets of personality judgment who reveal personal information about themselves facilitate ease of accurate personality judgment for the traits of [[agreeableness]], [[openness to experience]], and [[extraversion]].&lt;ref name="BeerBrooks2011"/&gt; Additionally, individuals who disclose personal values to others may facilitate the ease of accurate judgment of [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name="BeerBrooks2011"/&gt;
*Expressions of [[emotion]]&lt;ref name="HallGunnery2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Judith A.|last2=Gunnery|first2=Sarah D.|last3=Andrzejewski|first3=Susan A.|title=Nonverbal emotion displays, communication modality, and the judgment of personality|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=45|issue=1|year=2011|pages=77–83|issn=0092-6566|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2010.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Individuals who display facial expressions corresponding to negative emotions such as [[fear]] and [[sadness]] are judged as being more neurotic and less extraverted and agreeable.&lt;ref name="HallGunnery2011"/&gt; Individuals who display facial expressions corresponding to positive emotions are typically judged as being more extraverted and agreeable.&lt;ref name="HallGunnery2011"/&gt;
*[[Facial expression]]s corresponding to personality traits&lt;ref name="Penton-VoakPound2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penton-Voak|first1=Ian S.|last2=Pound|first2=Nicholas|last3=Little|first3=Anthony C.|last4=Perrett|first4=David I.|title=Personality Judgments from Natural and Composite Facial Images: More Evidence For A "Kernel Of Truth" In Social Perception|journal=Social Cognition|volume=24|issue=5|year=2006|pages=607–640|issn=0278-016X|doi=10.1521/soco.2006.24.5.607}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Individuals are able to accurately judge many traits on the basis of viewing photographs of the faces of people who exemplify specific traits.&lt;ref name="Penton-VoakPound2006"/&gt; Individuals are especially accurate at judging personality when viewing a photograph that consists of a composite of faces that display the same trait.&lt;ref name="Penton-VoakPound2006"/&gt;

==Effects on behavior==
Personality judgment not only influences perceptions of individuals, it also may influence the behavior of individuals being judged. This phenomenon is known as [[behavioural confirmation|behavioral confirmation]], and occurs when one's preconceived ideas about a person influence the behavior of the person. For example, if an individual is believed to be aggressive, one's behavior toward that individual may elicit an aggressive response, even if the individual is not typically aggressive.&lt;ref name="SnyderKlein2005"/&gt; Behavioral confirmation may occur in a variety of settings, including classrooms and social interactions. Researchers have shown that when a male individual believes he is talking to an attractive woman over the phone, the woman will act more sociable and agreeable than if the male believes he is talking to an unattractive woman.&lt;ref name="Tanke"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Snyder | first1 = M. | last2 = Tanke | first2 = E. D. | last3 = Berscheid | first3 = E. | year = 1977 | title = Social perception and interpersonal behavior: On the self-fulfilling nature of social stereotypes | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 35 | issue = 9| pages = 656–666 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.656 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the woman's behavior in this situation is being influenced by the male's expectations concerning her appearance, rather than her actual personality characteristics.&lt;ref name="Tanke"/&gt;

==Cultural influences==

An additional determinant of the processes through which personality is judged and the accuracy of these judgments is [[culture]]. Typically, researchers report cross-cultural consistency in the judgment of personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albright | first1 = L. | last2 = Malloy | first2 = T. E. | last3 = Dong | first3 = Q. | last4 = Kenny | first4 = D. A. | last5 = Fang | first5 = X. | year = 1997 | title = Cross-cultural consensus in personality judgments | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 72 | issue = 3| pages = 558–569 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, people from different types of cultures tend to find certain traits more easily identifiable than others, based on judging personality from facial characteristics of targets alone.&lt;ref name="WalkerJiang2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walker|first1=M.|last2=Jiang|first2=F.|last3=Vetter|first3=T.|last4=Sczesny|first4=S.|title=Universals and Cultural Differences in Forming Personality Trait Judgments From Faces|journal=Social Psychological and Personality Science|volume=2|issue=6|year=2011|pages=609–617|issn=1948-5506|doi=10.1177/1948550611402519}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people from Western cultures are typically better able to identify the traits of [[extroversion]] and [[aggression]] than individuals from Eastern cultures.&lt;ref name="WalkerJiang2011"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7578">'''Professional courtesy''' generally refers to a philosophy of particular professional behavior or etiquette which is extended between members of the same profession. The concept of professional courtesy is believed to have originated within the ancient practice of medicine by where physicians provided services to other physicians without charge. However, the philosophy does not necessarily involve the same courtesy across all professions. Nor is professional courtesy a mandated privilege, but is freely given at the discretion of the party extending the courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cji.edu/site/assets/files/1921/professionalcourtesy.pdf|title=Professional Courtesy Ethics in Policing|last=McVay|first=Jerold A.|date=2012-04-22|website=Crim. Justice Institute|publisher=Univ. of Arkansas|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the etiquette is not limited to physicians, the medical profession is likely the oldest and most well known for having such a long-standing tradition of professional courtesy among its professionals. Some other well known groups who have some form of professional courtesy also include attorneys, performing arts, and law enforcement. The phrase may also be applied in a literal form, such as the required ethical behavior of lawyers towards each other.&lt;ref name="KBA"&gt;{{cite web| title = Code of Professional Courtesy| work = Kentucky Bar Association| url = http://www.kybar.org/Default.aspx?tabid=228| accessdate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In medicine==
In 1803, [[Thomas Percival]] wrote his classic essay on medical ethics which endorsed complimentary professional care to “All members of the profession, including apothecaries as well as physicians and surgeons, together with their wives and children, should be attended gratuitously.” In 1847, the American Medical Association’s Code of Ethics similarly endorsed withholding charges for services to other physicians and their families,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; known as professional courtesy. This is likely the first modern day documentation of the philosophy.

Among [[physician]]s, it has been historically traditional to provide medical care at no or reduced cost to physician colleagues and their immediate family members.&lt;ref name="ama"&gt;{{cite web| title = AMA Code of Medical Ethics, E-6.13, Professional Courtesy| work = | url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion613.page?| accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original purpose of this was to discourage physicians from treating themselves and members of their own family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Jones, MD, PhD, MHA|first = James|last2 = McCullough, PhD|first2 = Laurence|last3 = Richman, MA|first3 = Bruce|date = 2004-05-01|title = Ethics of Professional Courtesy|url = http://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(04)00144-2/pdf|journal = Journal of Vascular Surgery|volume = 39|issue = 5|pages = 1140–1141|doi = 10.1016/j.jvs.2004.01.035|pmid =|lay-url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The custom dates back to [[Hippocrates]],&lt;ref name="mm"&gt;Rathbun, Katharine C., M.D.; Richards, Edward P. III, J.D.; ''Professional Courtesy''; Missouri Medicine; 1998;95:18-20; [http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Articles/Professional_Courtesy.html (on-line)].&lt;/ref&gt; well before physicians reached middle-class income levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  However, physicians regularly providing free or reduced rate services as professional courtesy must remain mindful in the age of copays, insurance only billing, and referrals, the practice can run afoul of the law under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hawleytroxell.com/2011/12/professional-courtesy-problems/|title = Professional Courtesy Problems - Hawley Troxell - Health Law|last =|first =|date =|year = 2011|publisher = Hawley Troxell - Health Law|access-date = 2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the American Medical Association issued a Code of Medical Ethics Opinion advising free of charge and reduced rate services was not an ethical requirement, and physicians should use their own judgment in deciding to extend such professional courtesy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion613.page?|title=Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 6.13 - Professional Courtesy|last=|first=|date=1994-06-01|website=American Medical Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In law enforcement ==
The term has been used to refer to the practice by law enforcement officers allowing other officers to engage in traffic violations and some crimes without being reported or arrested. There are three tools that law enforcement officers use to implement "professional courtesy":

First, some states (such as [[California]]) issue "confidential [[Vehicle registration plate|plate]]s" to employees in law enforcement, and other public officials. The plates keep identities and addresses anonymous, allowing employees the inadvertent ability to travel on toll-ways without charge.&lt;ref name = "Corrupt"&gt;{{cite web| title = Special license plates shield officials from traffic tickets| work = ocregister.com|url = http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dmv-police-confidential-2011354-program-records | accessdate = 2009-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even serious offences such as drunk driving are subject to professional courtesy "discretion", and [[federal law]] assists in the process by exempting police officers and firefighters from a federal law that requires truck drivers to be blood-tested after an accident.&lt;ref name = "DUI Cops"&gt;{{cite news| title = A broken system works in favor of cops busted for DUI| work = seattlepi.com|url = http://www.seattlepi.com/specials/undueinfluence/326446_dui06.html | accessdate = 2009-06-02| first1=Eric| last1=Nalder| first2=Lewis| last2=Kamb| first3=P-I| last3=Investigative| date=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, there is a web site offering law enforcement employees the purchase of a "family card" they can give to friends and family to produce at, for example, a traffic stop to identify them to the officer as a family member.  Anti-police groups and people wary of the ethical actions of police officers purport that where an ordinary member of the public would get a ticket this notification card will cause the officer to overlook any violations of the law the person may have made and tell them to go on their way.&lt;ref name = "police"&gt;{{cite web| title = Professional Courtesy| work = NJLawman.com|url = http://njlawman.com/Feature%20Pieces/Professional%20Courtesy.htm| accessdate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vendor of this card is explicit about the intention behind these cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leoprocards.com/|title=LEOProCards|work=|accessdate=2012-08-05}}http://leoprocards.com/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619001525/http://leoprocards.com/ |date=2012-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In theater ==
Until the 1960s it was customary for theater managements to permit members of [[Actors' Equity Association|Actors Equity]] and other members of the profession into Broadway shows for free. This practice continues in the [[Off-Off-Broadway]] world where members of Equity must be admitted free of charge to any Showcase production in which there is a member of the union in the cast if there are seats left at curtain time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actorsequity.org AEA website]&lt;/ref&gt; This applies as well to ''bona fide'' producers, directors and casting directors, who do not have to wait until showtime to be seated.

'''''prototype 180''''' is an artwork by [[United States|American]] [[conceptual art]]ist [[Mary Ellen Carroll]] who lives and works in [[New York City]] and [[Houston]]. ''prototype 180'' is "the centerpiece of Carroll's Innovation Territories, an initiative co-sponsored by the Rice University Building Institute.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.media.rice.edu/media/NewsBot.asp?MODE=VIEW&amp;ID=13796"&lt;/ref&gt; ''prototype 180'' is located at 6513 Sharpsview Drive, Houston.&lt;ref&gt;"http://www.domusweb.it/en/news/prototype-180-by-mary-ellen-carroll/"&lt;/ref&gt;Houston was self-selected itself as the site of the artwork because it lacks an official land-use policy. 

The artwork "will make architecture performative."&lt;ref name="artforum1"&gt;"http://artforum.com/words/id=23335"&lt;/ref&gt; It is literally a ground-shifting exercise, because it structurally involves the rotation, back to front, of a single-family, ranch-style house and its surrounding land in the development of [[Sharpstown]], a suburb of [[Houston]], [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In Texas, an Artist Plans to Rotate a House 180 Degrees |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/garden/07qna.html?_r=1 |work=The New York Times |date=October 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Christian Hansen''' (February 15, 1939 – August 21, 2014), known in the media as the "'''Butcher Baker'''", was an [[United States|American]] [[serial killer]]. Between 1971 and 1983, Hansen abducted, raped, and murdered at least 17 women in and around [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], hunting them down in the wilderness with a [[Ruger Mini-14]] and a knife. He was arrested and convicted in 1983 and was sentenced to 461 years and a [[life sentence]] without the possibility of [[parole]].&lt;ref name="anchorage"&gt;[http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20140522/butcher-baker-robert-hansen-moved-anchorage-medical-treatment 'Butcher Baker' Robert Hansen moved to Anchorage for medical treatment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627040249/http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/20140522/butcher-baker-robert-hansen-moved-anchorage-medical-treatment |date=June 27, 2014 }}, ''Alaska Dispatch''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ktuu.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klint|first1=Chris|title=Serial Killer Robert Hansen Dies in Anchorage|url=http://www.ktuu.com/news/news/serial-killer-robert-hansen-dies-in-anchorage/27664412|accessdate=August 21, 2014|agency=KTTU News|publisher=NBC|date=August 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Robert Hansen was born in [[Estherville]], [[Iowa]], in 1939. He was the son of a [[Danish people|Danish]] immigrant and followed in his father's footsteps as a baker. In his youth, he was skinny and painfully shy, afflicted with a [[stutter]] and severe [[acne]] that left him permanently scarred. Shunned by the attractive girls in school, he grew up hating them and nursing fantasies of cruel revenge. Throughout childhood and adolescence, Hansen was described as being quiet and a loner and he had an unhealthy relationship with his domineering father. He started to practice both hunting and [[archery]] and often found refuge in these pastimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Hansen enlisted in the [[United States Army Reserve]] and served for one year before being discharged. He later worked as an assistant drill instructor at a police academy in [[Pocahontas, Iowa]]. There, he began a relationship with a younger woman. He married her in the summer of 1960.

On December 7, 1960, he was arrested for [[arson|burning down]] a [[Pocahontas County, Iowa|Pocahontas County]] Board of Education school bus garage, for which he served 20 months of a three-year prison sentence in [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=D'Oro|first= Rachel|title=Robert Hansen, convicted serial killer in Alaska, dies at 75|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/robert-hansen-dies-at-75-convicted-alaska-serial-killer/2014/08/22/cf2d2acc-2989-11e4-86ca-6f03cbd15c1a_story.html|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imdb.com"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2005374/combined|title=''The Frozen Ground''|website=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife filed for divorce while he was incarcerated. Over the next few years, he was jailed several times for [[petty theft]]. In 1967, he moved to [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]], [[Alaska]], with his second wife, whom he had married in 1963 and with whom he had two children. In Anchorage, he was well liked by his neighbors and set several local hunting records.

== Investigation ==
On June 13, 1983, 17-year-old Cindy Paulson escaped from Hansen,&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; while he was trying to load her into his [[Piper Super Cub]].&lt;ref name="Body Exhumed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Newton|first1=Jennifer|title='We just want her to be identified': Body of Alaska serial killer victim exhumed 30 years after she was found dead|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2743173/Body-Alaska-serial-killers-victim-exhumed.html|accessdate=December 24, 2015|agency=Mail Online|publisher=Daily Mail|date=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told police he had offered her $200 to perform oral sex but that, when she got into the car, he pulled a gun on her and drove her to his home in [[Muldoon, Anchorage|Muldoon]]. There, he held her captive, [[torture|torturing]], [[rape|raping]] and [[sexual assault|sexually assaulting]] her. She mentioned that, after he chained her by the neck to a post in the house's basement, Hansen took a nap on a nearby couch.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

When he awoke, he put her in his car and took her to [[Merrill Field]] airport, where he told her that he intended to "take her out to his cabin" (a shack in the [[Knik River]] area of the [[Matanuska Valley]] accessible only by boat or [[bush plane]]). Paulson, crouched in the back seat of the car with her wrists cuffed in front of her body, waited to escape until Hansen was busy loading the airplane's cockpit. While Hansen's back was turned, Paulson crawled out of the back seat, opened the driver's side door and ran toward nearby Sixth Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

She later told police that she had left her blue sneakers on the passenger side floor of the sedan's backseat, as evidence that she had been in the car. Hansen panicked and chased her, but Paulson made it to Sixth Avenue first and managed to flag down a passing truck. The driver, Robert Yount, alarmed by her disheveled appearance, stopped and picked her up. He drove her to the Mush Inn, where she jumped out of the truck and ran inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mushinn.com/index.html |title=Mush Inn Motel|website=www.mushinn.com|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While she pleaded with the clerk to phone her boyfriend at the Big Timber Motel, the truck driver continued on to work, where he called the police to report the barefoot, handcuffed woman.

When [[Anchorage Police Department]] officers arrived at the Mush Inn, they were told that the young woman had taken a cab to the Big Timber Motel. APD officers arrived at Room 110 of the Big Timber Motel and found Cindy Paulson, still handcuffed and alone. She was taken to APD [[headquarters]], where she described the perpetrator. Hansen, when questioned by APD officers, denied the accusation, stating that Paulson was just trying to cause some trouble because he would not pay her [[extortion]] demands. Although Hansen had several prior run-ins with the law, his meek demeanour and humble occupation as a baker, along with a strong alibi from his friend John Henning, kept him from being considered as a serious suspect and the case went [[cold case|cold]].

Detective Glenn Flothe of the [[Alaska State Troopers]] had been part of a team investigating the discovery of several bodies in and around [[Anchorage]], [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] and the [[Matanuska-Susitna Valley]] area. The first of the bodies was found by construction workers near Eklutna Road. The body, dubbed "[[Eklutna Annie]]" by investigators, has never been identified. Later that year, the body of Joanna Messina was discovered in a gravel pit near Seward and in 1982, the remains of 23-year-old Sherry Morrow were discovered, in a shallow grave near the [[Knik River]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Flothe now had three bodies and what looked like one killer.

He contacted [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Special Agent [[Roy Hazelwood]] and requested help with a [[offender profiling|criminal psychological profile]], based on the three recovered bodies. Hazelwood thought that the killer would be an experienced hunter with low [[self-esteem]], have a history of being rejected by women and would feel compelled to keep "souvenirs" of his murders, such as a victim's jewelry. He also suggested that the assailant might stutter. Using this profile, Flothe investigated possible suspects until he reached Hansen, who fit the profile and owned a plane.&lt;ref&gt;''Fair Game'' {{ISBN|978-1-852-86484-2}} p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported by Paulson's testimony and Hazelwood's profile, Flothe and the APD secured a [[warrant (law)|warrant]] to search Hansen's plane, cars and home. On October 27, 1983, investigators uncovered jewelry belonging to some of the missing women, as well as an array of firearms in a corner hideaway of Hansen's attic. Also found was an aviation map with little "x" marks on it, hidden behind Hansen's [[headboard (furniture)|headboard]].

When confronted with the evidence found in his home, Hansen denied it as long as he could but he eventually began to blame the women and tried to justify his motives. Eventually, confessing to each item of evidence as it was presented to him, he admitted to a spree of attacks against Alaskan women starting in 1971. Hansen's earliest victims were young women, usually between 16 and 19 and not sex workers, unlike the victims who led to his discovery.

==Known victims==

Hansen is known to have raped and assaulted over 30 Alaskan women. He is also responsible for murdering at least 17, ranging in age from 16 to 41.&lt;ref name=library&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lohr|first1=David|title=Hunting Humans|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/robert_hansen/2.html|website=crimelibrary.com|accessdate=June 26, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714182421/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/robert_hansen/2.html|archivedate=July 14, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were:

Of these 17 women, Hansen was only formally charged with the murder of four - Sherry Morrow, Joanna Messina, Eklutna Annie and Paula Goulding. He was also charged with the kidnapping and rape of Cindy Paulson.

== Imprisonment ==
[[File:SpringCreekEntrance.jpg|thumb|[[Spring Creek Correctional Center]], where Hansen was incarcerated for many years]]
Once arrested, Hansen was charged with [[assault]], [[kidnapping]], multiple weapons offenses, and [[theft]] and [[insurance fraud]]. The last charge was related to a claim filed with the insurance company over alleged theft of some trophies, whose funds he used to purchase the Super Cub. At trial, he claimed he later recovered the trophies in his backyard but forgot to inform the insurer.

Only after [[ballistics|ballistics tests]] returned a match between bullets found at the crime scenes and Hansen's rifle, did he enter into a [[plea bargain]]. He pleaded guilty to the four homicides the police had evidence for (Morrow, Messina, Goulding and Eklutna Annie) and provided details about his other victims, in return for serving his sentence in a federal prison, along with no publicity in the press. Another condition of the plea bargain was his participation in deciphering the markings on his aviation map and locating his victims' bodies. He confirmed the police theory of how the women were abducted, adding that he would sometimes let a potential victim go if she convinced him that she wouldn't report him to police. He indicated that he began killing in the early 1970s.

He showed investigators 17 grave sites, in and around [[Southcentral Alaska]], 12 of which were unknown to investigators. There remained marks on his map that he refused to give up, including three in [[Resurrection Bay]], near Seward (authorities suspect two of these marks belong to the graves of Mary Thill and Megan Emrick, whom Hansen has denied killing). The remains of 12 (of a probable 21) victims were exhumed by the police and returned to their families. Hansen was sentenced by [[jury]] to 461 years plus life in prison, without the possibility of parole. He was first imprisoned at the [[United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg]] in [[Lewisburg, Pennsylvania]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In 1988, he was returned to Alaska and briefly incarcerated at [[Lemon Creek, Alaska|Lemon Creek]] Correctional Center in [[Juneau]]. He was also imprisoned at [[Spring Creek Correctional Center]] in [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] until May 2014, when he was transported to the [[Anchorage Correctional Complex]] for health reasons.&lt;ref name="anchorage" /&gt;

==Death==
Hansen died at the age of 75, at Alaska Regional Hospital in Anchorage on August 21, 2014, due to undisclosed, lingering health conditions.&lt;ref name="ktuu.com"/&gt;

After the [[Second World War]] in 1945, issues surrounding wartime loss and compensation started to arise. Cultural valuables were taken from [[Germany]] and placed in the [[Soviet Union]]. Years later, at the break up of the [[USSR]], the said cultural valuables came to attention as the issue of ownership arose. Following, the debates between the [[Russian Duma]] and the [[Yeltsin]] government began, with the Duma focusing on compensation to Russia for wartime loss, and Yeltsin focusing on maintaining international relationships and agreements. Arising from the debate, were many struggles, but ultimately the enactment of the '''Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of the Second World War and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation'''.

==Background==
At the end of the [[Second World War]] in 1945, in what some would argue as retaliation, and others as compensation for the massive loss of cultural property the [[Soviet Union]] suffered, cultural valuables (such as books, art, artifacts, etc.) were taken (stolen, or relocated) from [[Germany]]. Since the end of the War the existence of such valuables were kept secret, and their existence was denied. In total during [[World War II]], nearly thirty million Soviet people died as a result of prison camps, torture, starvation and cold blood murder. The [[USSR]] suffered a huge wartime loss, not only through cultural property but also by the deaths of millions of people. In 1991 when the collapse of the Soviet Union occurred, and the rise of the [[Russian Federation]] began, mention of vast amounts of hidden cultural valuables came to light because the issue of ownership arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monten|first=Lina|title=Soviet World War II Trophy Art In Present Day Russia: The Events, The Law, and The Current Controversies|journal=Depual J. Art. &amp; Ent. Law|year=2004–2005|volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
===Yeltsin in Favour of Restitution 1992===
In June 1992, a Decree of the [[Russian Government]] created what was called the State Commission for Restitution of Cultural Valuables, which was to decide issues related to restitution. However, the Commission did very little and was at a halt by June 1993, and then was later abolished by March 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Also, in 1992, there were many bilateral cultural agreements with a number of countries such as, [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Denmark]], Germany, [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Poland]], and the [[United Kingdom]] for mutual [[restitution]] of displaced cultural valuables; none of which were talked about in the [[Constitutional Court]] ruling in 1999 about the constitutionality of the Russian 1998 law, where international agreements were to be put above domestic laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, in June 1992 there was the only [[restitution]] of books to the west by Russia; there was 600 Dutch books that were returned to the [[Netherlands]]. But, this is only a small portion of the estimated 30,000 Dutch books that had arrived in the USSR. The idea of restitution did not last long, and soon turned into demands for compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duma halts restitution 1994===
Starting in 1994, the idea of restitution had completely come to a stop, and the debates started about constructing a law on said cultural valuables. [[Duma]] deputies are responsible for the start of the debate by stating that there is lack of [[international laws]] and the inadequacy of domestic legislation to justify its refusal to permit further restitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came about when Duma deputies refused the return of French archives that were a part of a 1992 agreement. 
Demands for compensation from wartime loss and destruction started to arise from the Duma deputies, suggesting that other countries should be charged storage fees for what was held in Russia secretly for over 50 years; and further that the only possible restitution of cultural valuables that would occur to other nations was in exchange for Russian cultural valuables, because the deputies at this point were arguing that many of the plundered cultural valuables from Russia were being held across the ocean from the United States Zone of Occupation in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, with the support of some legal specialists and Russian legislators argue that all the cultural valuables that were brought to [[Moscow]] under government orders were all done so legally. But, nevertheless there is the other side of the debate, which is also supported by the [[Yeltsin]] government, who argue for compromise and internationally appropriate solutions.

===Duma Proposes Law 1995 and 1996===
For six years the debate continued. In January 1995 a large international conference was held in [[New York City]] titled "Spoils of War", where the international context about the issues surrounding cultural valuables plundered or misplaced at the end of the Second World War came to light. Firstly, it was important to note that no allied agreement that was made ever stated that works of art or other cultural property could be used for compensation purposes. Efforts such as what was done by the British and the Americans, where they carried out an elaborate program of restitution to countries of origin were discussed. Stories such as the [[United States]] had returned over half a million cultural items to the Soviet Union, but Russians were not aware of this, were among many topics discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On an international level, legal concepts and precedents existed during the time of the plundering from Germany in 1945, such as the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]] of 1907. Specifically Article 56 of the Convention "forbids the seizure, damaging and destruction of property of educational and art institutions, … and articles of scientific and artistic value belonging to individuals and societies as well as to the State".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such international law did not stop [[Stalin]] from ordering the seizure of cultural valuables as compensatory reparations from Germany. However, Stalin's order is still followed by the Russian position 50 years later, as they would argue that these transfers (seizures) were carried out legally after the war as compensation. On the other side such a point of view is wrong because Russia is not in compliance with international law regarding the protection of cultural property. 
Despite the ongoing debate and Russia's failure to restitute cultural valuables to other [[Europe]]an countries, Russia had an interest in becoming a member of the [[Council of Europe]]. In order for Russia to become a member they had to sign a statement of intent in order to be admitted, which they did and gained admission in late 1995. Russia at this time agreed to negotiate claims for the return of cultural property to other European countries, and to return property that was transferred to Moscow in 1945, in a rapid manner. Surprisingly, nothing to this agreement ever occurred or was of any mention in the Russian press; and less than a year later in May 1996 the Duma passed the first reading of the proposed law nationalizing the spoils of war. The law emphasized compensation to Russia for wartime loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeltsin's Position, July 1996===
It was not long after, in early July 1996, the law was passed almost unanimously, making other European counties very hostile about the law. The passage started a slew of diplomatic protests, and as a result the Russian Upper House, the [[Council of the Federation]], rejected the law strongly because of the outcry from the Yeltsin administration. [[Boris Yeltsin]], president of the [[Russian Federation]] at the time, and his administration stood strong behind this argument for rejecting the law on the basis that it would conflict with numerous international agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duma Passes Law, March 1997===
Nevertheless, the law continued to gain support from other nationalist-oriented parties, and the push for the passage of the law continued. The chair of the Duma Committee on Culture, [[Nikolai Gubenko]], continued to stress that the law was a must, on the basis that all the cultural property that was transported to what was the Soviet Union was all done so legally according to allied agreements, and that the law is way of providing justice to the loved ones, nearly 30 million, that are no longer with us due to the horrific outcomes of the war. With more gained support, and a slightly revised law, the Duma again almost unanimously passed the law on February 5, 1997, and was further passed by the upper house, the Council of Federation on March 5, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeltsin Vetoes the Law, March 1997===
Sticking to what he believed, and despite the ongoing support for the law, President Yeltsin [[vetoed]] the law on March 18, 1997. Making his position clear in his official message to the Duma, Yeltsin stood firm that the law was in contradiction of the Constitution. Further Yeltsin pointed out that the law went against Russian bilateral agreements with other European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional Court ruling==
Notwithstanding the President's power to veto the law, the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, with a vote of 141 to 37 in favor of the law on May 14, 1997. Regardless of the fact that the Council of the Federation overrode Yeltsin's veto, he still refused to sign the law, and further cited allegations of voting irregularities; and repeated his position that the law conflicted Russia's international legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
President Yeltsin was forced to sign the law by the [[Constitutional Court]] in a decision on April 6, 1998. The Constitutional Court ruled that they were unable to consider the constitutionality of the law before the President signed it. So, on April 15, 1998, President Yeltsin signed the law making it officially Federal Law. The Law did return to Constitutional Court in 1999 for review on the basis of unconstitutionality, contradiction of Russia's international legal obligation and alleged irregular voting practices. The ruling of July 20, 1999 did rule in fact that parts of the law were unconstitutional and that parts of the voting process were violated; but despite these findings the law was still validated and found not in conflict with the Constitution. The ruling further stated that the cultural valuables that were relocated to now what is known as Russia at the end of the Second World War should not be returned to the former aggressor countries and should remain in Russia as a form of compensation. The law was sent back to the Duma for amendments to be made in November 1999, and then finally May 25th, 2000, the Federal Law received the Presidential signature from the then President [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The law==
The Federal Law on Cultural Valuables Displaced to the USSR as a Result of World War II and Located on the Territory of the Russian Federation consists of six Chapters and twenty-five Articles. The Law is aimed at governing cultural valuables displaced to know what is known as Russia. The fundamental goals of the Federal Law are "to protect said valuables from misappropriation and prevent their illegal export beyond the borders of the Russian Federation as well as their unlawful transfer to whomsoever; to establish the necessary legal bases for treating said cultural valuables as partial compensation for the damage caused to the cultural property of the Russian Federation as a result of the plunder and destruction of its cultural valuables by Germany and its war allies during World War II; to protect the interests of the Russian Federation in the settlement of disputed issues with foreign states concerning said cultural valuables through consistent compliance with the principle of mutuality; to provide a possibility for acquainting citizens of the Russian Federation and foreign citizens, including specialists in the fields of education, science and culture, with said cultural valuables; and to create favorable conditions for the continuous development of international cooperation in the fields of education, science and culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Documentation Project|url=http://docproj.loyola.edu/rlaw/r2.html|accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International criticism==
The Law enacted by the Russian Federation on displaced cultural valuables, has been nothing but been criticized on an international level. A [[Hungary|Hungarian]] specialist cited a large number of issues on how the Russian law violates international law and treaties. But more specifically, emphasized that Hungary is entitled to the restitution of Hungarian property removed to the USSR as a result of the Second World War. Further, similar feelings were expressed by a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] specialist, who argues that [[Ukraine]] and other former Soviet republics should have a say in determining the fate of their cultural valuables, on the basis of international norms and democratic principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A specific criticism of the law is the notion of a limitation period. This is the idea that a claim must be made within 18 months of the information about a specific cultural valuable is published in an appropriate federal agency publication. This strikes a lot of concerns because who decides and what is an adequate publication, and after the 18 months what happens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2009, a Ministry of Culture legal specialist wrote that the passage of the law "would appear as a unilateral Russian rejection of its international obligations and evoke a negative impact on international relations of the Russian Federation with various European governments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kennedy Grimsted|first=Patricia|title=Legalizing "Compensation" and the Spoils of War: The Russian Law on Displaced Cultural Valuables and the Manipulation of Historical Memory|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|year=2010|volume=17|pages=217–255|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7901887&amp;jid=JCP&amp;volumeId=17&amp;issueId=02&amp;aid=7901885|accessdate=21 November 2013|doi=10.1017/s094073911000010x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Recently, in June 2013, news reports illustrate that the controversy about the appropriation of German artefacts by the USSR, is still on going between Germany's [[Angela Merkel]] and Russia's [[Vladimir Putin]]. During a visit in [[St-Petersburg]], Angela Merkel, chancellor of Germany, criticized an exhibition at the [[Hermitage Museum]] that contained a number of valuables that were stolen from Germany. President Putin declared that the issue is very sensitive and that both sides would continue to talk to resolve the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Merkel and Putin view exhibition of disputed art|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23001274|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=June 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Nuphar_lutea_170803.jpg|thumb|250px|The natural water lily leaf]]
'''{{lang|de|Seeblatt|italic=no}}''' (German for 'lake leaf', plural ''{{lang|de|Seeblätter}}''; {{lang-da|søblad}}; {{lang-fy|pompeblêd}}) is the term for the stylized leaf of a [[Nuphar lutea|water lily]], used as a charge in heraldry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mistholme.com/dictionary/seeblatt/ Mistholme: Seeblatt], retrieved on 18 Feb. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

This charge is used in the heraldry of Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, but not so much in France and Britain. Seeblätter feature prominently on the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] as well as on [[Danish coins]].

In [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]], the term ''pompeblêd'' is used. The name is used to indicate the seven red lily leaf-shaped blades on the [[Flag of Friesland (province)|Frisian flag]]. The seven red ''pompeblêden'' (leaves of the [[Nuphar lutea|yellow water lily]] and the [[Nymphaea alba|European white waterlily]]) refer to the medieval Frisian 'sea districts': more ore less autonomous regions along the Southern North Sea coast from the city of Alkmaar to the [[Weser]] River. There never have been exactly seven of these administrative units, the number of seven bears the suggestion of 'a lot'. Late mediaeval sources identify seven Frisian districts, though with different names. The most important regions were [[West Friesland (region)|West Friesland]], [[Westergo]], [[Oostergo]], [[Hunsingo]], [[Fivelingo]], [[Reiderland]], [[Emsingo]], [[Brokmerland]], [[Harlingerland]] and [[Rüstringen]] ([[Jeverland]] and [[Butjadingen]]).

{{Political campaigning}}
A '''smear campaign''', also referred to as a '''smear tactic''' or simply a '''smear''', is an effort to damage or call into question someone's [[reputation]], by propounding negative [[propaganda]].{{cn|date=September 2018}} It can be applied to individuals or groups.

Common targets are public officials, [[politicians]], [[political candidate]]s, [[Activism|activists]] and ex-spouses. The term also applies in other contexts such as the workplace.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;Jay C. Thomas, Michel Hersen (2002) Handbook of Mental Health in the Workplace&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''smear campaign'' became popular around 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Smear+campaign&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4;,Smear+campaign;,c0;,s0;;smear+campaign;,c0;;Smear+Campaign;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|author=|date=|website=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
A smear campaign is an intentional, premeditated effort to undermine an individual's or group's reputation, credibility, and [[Character assassination|character]]. Like [[negative campaigning]], most often smear campaigns target government officials, politicians, political candidates, and other public figures. However, private persons or groups may also become targets of smear campaigns perpetrated in  companies, institutions, the legal system, and other formal groups.

Smear tactics differ from normal discourse or debate in that they do not bear upon the issues or arguments in question. A smear is a simple attempt to malign a group or an individual with the aim of undermining their credibility.

Smears often consist of [[ad hominem]] attacks in the form of unverifiable rumors and [[cognitive distortion|distortions]], [[half-truth]]s, or even outright [[lie]]s; smear campaigns are often propagated by [[gossip magazine]]s. Even when the facts behind a smear campaign are demonstrated to lack proper foundation, the tactic is often effective because the target's reputation is tarnished before the truth is known.

Smears are also effective in diverting attention away from the matter in question and onto a specific individual or group. The target of the smear typically must focus on correcting the [[False accusation|false information]] rather than on the original issue.

Deflection has been described as a ''wrap-up smear'': "You make up something. Then you have the press write about it. And then you say, everybody is writing about this charge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Pelosi, Nancy | date=2017-03-05 | title=State of the Union | medium=Television production | publisher=CNN | url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1703/05/sotu.01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smear tactics are considered by many to be a low, disingenuous form of discourse; they are nevertheless very common.

==Cluster B==
Smear campaigns have been identified as a common weapon of [[psychopaths]]&lt;ref name=Thomas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Junie Moon (2012) Surviving the Predators Among Us&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Borderline personality disorder|Borderlines]] and [[narcissists]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Nightshade (2016) ''A Pre-Book and a Victim's Guide to Surviving the Narcissist''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bailey&gt;Bailey-Rug C (2016) It's Not You, It's Them: When People Are More Than Selfish&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Burgo (2016). ''The Narcissist You Know: Defending Yourself Against Extreme Narcissists in an All-About-Me Age''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
In many countries, the law recognizes the value of reputation and credibility. Both [[Slander and libel|libel]] (a false and damaging publication) and slander (a false and damaging oral statement) are often punishable by law and may result in imprisonment or compensation or fees for damages done.

==Targets==
Smear tactics are commonly used to undermine effective arguments or critiques.

===John C. Frémont – 1856 US presidential election candidate===
{{Main article|John C. Frémont#Republican presidential candidate}}

During the 1856 presidential election, [[John C. Frémont]] was the target of a smear campaign alleging that he was a Catholic.  The campaign was designed to undermine support for Fremont from those who were suspicious of Catholics.

[[File:1856-Republican-party-Fremont-isms-caricature.jpg|thumb|"The Great Republican Reform Party Calling on their Candidate", an 1856 print which is a political cartoon about [[John C. Frémont]], the first Republican party candidate for president of the United States. There was a political campaign smear rumor current in 1856 that Fremont was a Catholic (the purpose of which was to prevent Fremont from gaining support from those who were suspicious of Catholics).]]

===General Motors against Ralph Nader===
[[Ralph Nader]] was the victim of a smear campaign during the 1960s, when he was campaigning for car safety. In order to smear Nader and deflect public attention from his campaign, [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] engaged private investigators to search for damaging or embarrassing incidents from his past. In early March 1966, several media outlets, including ''The New Republic'' and ''The New York Times'', reported that GM had tried to discredit Nader, hiring private detectives to [[telephone tapping|tap his phones]] and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Longhine |first=Laura |url=http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/November-December-2005/scene_longhine_novdec05.msp |title=Ralph Nader's museum of tort law will include relics from famous lawsuits—if it ever gets built |date = December 2005|work=Legal Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2005-05-07 |work=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/safetyep.htm |title=President Dwight D.

Nader's lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the [[New York Court of Appeals]], whose opinion in the case expanded [[tort law]] to cover "overzealous surveillance."&lt;ref&gt;''Nader v. General Motors Corp.'', 307 N.Y.S.2d 647 (N.Y. 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.

===Gary Hart – 1988 US presidential candidate===
{{Main|Gary Hart#1988 presidential campaign}}

[[Gary Hart]] was the target of a smear campaign during the 1988 US presidential campaign.  Smear campaigns are a [[political strategy|campaign tactic]] associated with [[yellow journalism]] which is a type of journalism that presents little well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines, scandal-mongering and sensationalism.  For example, during [[Gary Hart]]'s 1988 presidential campaign, the ''New York Post'' reported on its front page big, black block letters: "GARY: I'M NO WOMANIZER."&lt;ref name=SafireVamping&gt;William Safire. (May 3, 1987). [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/magazine/on-language-vamping-till-ready.html "On Language; Vamping Till Ready"].

===China against Apple Inc.===
Countries have used smear campaigns to attempt to discredit Western companies. In 2011, China launched a smear campaign against [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], including TV and radio advertisements and articles in state-run papers.  The campaign failed to turn the Chinese public against the company and its products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2013/03/chinas-apple-propaganda/63582/|title=China's Apple Smear Campaign Has Totally Backfired|first=Rebecca|last=Greenfield|date=27 March 2013|website=theatlanticwire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sathya Sai Baba===
Spiritual leader [[Sathya Sai Baba]] was accused of fraud, sexual abuse and other misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm | work=BBC News | first=Tanya | last=Datta | title=Sai Baba: God-man or con man? | date=17 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Baba described the allegations as a "smear campaign".  He never faced any investigation and the critics were criticized for lacking any proof against him.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, Bill (27 November 2005), [https://web.archive.org/web/20060909111636/http://www.the-week.com/25nov27/currentevents_article10.htm Miracle of Welfare]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Julian Assange===
{{Main article|Assange v Swedish Prosecution Authority#Extradition process}}

The allegations against [[Julian Assange]] have been labelled by Australian journalist [[John Pilger]] as a smear campaign.&lt;ref name="PilgerWar"&gt;John Pilger, [http://johnpilger.com/articles/the-war-on-wikileaks-a-john-pilger-investigation-and-interview-with-julian-assange "The war on WikiLeaks: a John Pilger investigation and interview with Julian Assange,"] [[John Pilger]] Website, 13 January 2011.

===Brad Pitt's child custody dispute===
In 2016, [[Brad Pitt]] was the target of a smear campaign related to his child custody dispute.  Pitt was alleged to have acted inappropriately during an argument with his 15-year-old son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Lawler|title=Brad Pitt is furious about 'smear campaign' and will fight for custody, friends say|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/23/brad-pitt-is-furious-about-smear-campaign-and-will-fight-for-cus/|accessdate=16 October 2016|publisher=The Telegraph|date=September 23, 2016|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chris Bryant===
[[Chris Bryant]], a British parliamentarian, accused Russia in 2012 of orchestrating a smear campaign against him because of his criticism of [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name="Bryant - Telegraph - 2012"&gt;{{cite news|title=I'm a victim of Russian smear campaign, says MP photographed in underwear|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9697949/Im-a-victim-of-Russian-smear-campaign-says-MP-photographed-in-underwear.html|accessdate=27 January 2017|work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=23 November 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 he alleged that other British officials are vulnerable to Russian smear campaigns.&lt;ref name="Express- 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knowles|first1=Michael|title=Russian spies turn attention to British politicians in 'project smear', warns Labour MP|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/754556/russian-hacking-british-politicians-smear-campaign-labour-foreign-secretary|work=Express.co.uk|date=15 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian  - 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Mark|last2=Smith|first2=David|title=Senior British politicians ‘targeted by Kremlin’ for smear campaigns|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/14/russia-blackmail-chris-bryant-donald-trump-boris-johnson-liam-fox|accessdate=27 January 2017|work=The Guardian|date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other examples===
In January 2007, it was revealed that an anonymous website that attacked critics of [[Overstock.com]], including media figures and private citizens on message boards, was operated by an official of Overstock.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;sid=aLDKLcXDf9PU&amp;refer=columnist_antilla|title=Overstock Blames With Creepy Strategy|author=Antilla, Susan |publisher= Bloomberg News Service |date=February 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Dan (January 20, 2007).

Countries, particularly those outside the Western hemisphere, have accused Western powers of smear campaigns to bring down their governments. [[Gambia]] accused the United States and Britain of backing "so-called Gambians to set up organisations and media facilities to spread nothing but lies against The Gambia by making false, outrageous and unfounded statements about the state of human rights."&lt;ref&gt;https://news.yahoo.com/gambia-accuses-enemies-britain-us-smear-campaign-181728761.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a [[Deutsche Welle]] journalist, Nemanja Rujević, published a text accusing [[Saša Radulović]] leader of the [[Enough is Enough (party)|Enough is Enough]] party, of a tax debt of a few million dollars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/sr/dosta-je-milion/a-19449115|title=Dosta je milion {{!}} Politika {{!}} DW {{!}} 05.08.2016|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=sr|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since released (titled "A milion is enough"), it has been used in political campaigning against him by the [[Serbian Progressive Party|SNS]] ruling party. He claimed that it was all fabricated and that he will sue its author.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nedeljnik.rs/nedeljnik/portalnews/sasa-radulovic-ekskluzivno-za-nedeljnik-stigao-je-dokaz-da-americi-ne-dugujem-ni-dolar-za-porez/|title=Saša Radulović ekskluzivno za Nedeljnik: Stigao je dokaz da Americi ne dugujem ni dolar za porez|work=Nedeljnik|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Saša Radulović]] was never charged of avoiding to pay tax, and no warrant has been issued for his arrest, this article has been used often against his political engagement mostly by the president of the [[Serbian Progressive Party|SNS]] party, [[Aleksandar Vučić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rs.n1info.com/a204353/Vesti/Vesti/Rasprava-Radulovica-i-Vucica-u-Skupstini.html|title=Vučić o "marifetlucima" Radulovića, DJB o farsi u parlamentu|work=N1 Srbija|access-date=2018-02-18|language=sr-Latn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Skydiving France.jpg|thumb|250px|On average, skydiving participants felt that their own experience had taken 36% longer, which allows a person to remember what they experience in greater detail during intense situations.&lt;ref name="pmid18074019"/&gt;]] 
'''Tachypsychia''' is a neurological condition that alters the [[Time perception|perception of time]], usually induced by [[exercise|physical exertion]], [[psychoactive drugs|drug use]], or a [[psychological trauma|traumatic event]]. For someone affected by tachypsychia, time perceived by the individual either lengthens, making events appear to slow down, or contracts, objects appearing as moving in a speeding blur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Amato |first1=Ivan |title=When Bad Things Happen in Slow Motion |url=http://nautil.us/issue/61/coordinates/when-bad-things-happen-in-slow-motion-rp |accessdate=7 June 2018 |work=[[Nautilus (science magazine)]] |date=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that tachypsychia is induced by a combination of high levels of [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]], usually during periods of great physical stress or in violent confrontation.&lt;ref name="pmid18074019"/&gt; Interestingly, a controlled experiment from 2007 suggests the subjective experience of time slowing down is actually an artifact of memory, not an actual trait of real-time perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steton |first1=Chess |last2=et al |title=Does Time Really Slow Down during a Frightening Event? |journal=PLoS ONE |date=12 December 2017 |volume=2 |issue=12 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0001295 |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001295}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, newer research seems to contradict this, with results showing that during high stress events a focus on action preparation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hagura, Kanai, Orgs, Haggard |first1=Nobuhiro, Ryota, Guido, Patrick |title=Ready steady slow: action preparation slows the subjective passage of time |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/09/04/rspb.2012.1339 |website=rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org |publisher=The Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; actually does increase information processing, slowing down time perception. A 2012 review of most current research (including the 2007 study) seems to support this as well&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Arstila |first1=Valtteri |title=Time Slows Down during Accidents |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384265/ |website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=University of Turku}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to the contradictory research results and difficulty of accurately replicating the natural conditions in which the phenomenon occurs, there is still no set consensus on how tachypsychia functions.

==Physical responses==
Also called the "fight or flight" response of the body to an event our mind considers life-threatening, tachypsychia is believed to include numerous physical changes.

===Adrenaline response===
Upon being stimulated by fear or anger, the [[adrenal medulla]] may automatically produce the hormone [[adrenaline]] directly into the blood stream. This can have various effects on various bodily systems, including:
* Increased heart rate and blood pressure. It is common for a tachypsychia subject's pulse to rise to between 200 and 300 [[beats per minute]] (bpm).&lt;ref&gt;Eagleman, D. &amp; Pariyadath, V. (2009). Is subjective duration a signature of coding efficiency? Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B. 364: 1841-1851.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased [[heart rate]] (above 250 bpm) can cause [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], and the body may adduct all limbs, adopting fetal position, in preparation for a [[coma]].
* Dilation of the [[bronchus|bronchial passages]], permitting higher absorption of oxygen.
* Dilated pupils to allow more light to enter, and visual exclusion—tunnel vision—occurs, allowing greater focus but resulting in the loss of peripheral vision.
* Release of glucose into the bloodstream, generating extra energy by raising the [[blood sugar level]].&lt;ref name="pmid19073237"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gil S, Droit-Volet S | title = Time perception, depression and sadness | journal = Behavioural Processes | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–76 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19073237 | doi = 10.1016/j.beproc.2008.11.012 | url = http://cerca.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/IMG/pdf_BP09-GilColl.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140104031908/http://cerca.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/IMG/pdf_BP09-GilColl.pdf | archivedate = 2014-01-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for an individual to experience [[auditory exclusion]] or sensitivity. It is also common for individuals to experience an increased pain tolerance, loss of color vision, short term memory loss, decreased fine motor skills, decreased communication skills, or decreased coordination.

===Psychological response===
The most common experience during tachypsychia is the feeling that time has either increased or slowed down, brought on by the increased brain activity caused by epinephrine, or the severe decrease in brain activity caused by the "catecholamine washout" occurring after the event. The perception of the duration of an event seems to be modulated by our recent experiences. Humans typically overestimate the perceived duration of the initial event in a stream of identical events&lt;ref name=Rose1995&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rose D, Summers J | title = Duration illusions in a train of visual stimuli | journal = Perception | volume = 24 | issue = 10 | pages = 1177–87 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8577576 | doi = 10.1068/p241177 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and unexpected "oddball" stimuli seem to be perceived as longer in duration, relative to expected or frequently presented "standard" stimuli.&lt;ref name=Tse2004&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tse PU, Intriligator J, Rivest J, Cavanagh P | title = Attention and the subjective expansion of time | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 66 | issue = 7 | pages = 1171–89 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15751474 | doi = 10.3758/BF03196844 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oddball effect may serve an evolutionarily adapted "alerting" function and is consistent with reports of time slowing down in threatening situations. The effect seems to be strongest for images that are expanding in size on the retina, in other words, that are "looming" or approaching the viewer,&lt;ref name=Tse2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=New2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = New JJ, Scholl BJ | title = Subjective time dilation: spatially local, object-based, or a global visual experience? | journal = Journal of Vision | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 4.1–11 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19271914 | doi = 10.1167/9.2.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanWassenhove2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Wassenhove V, Buonomano DV, Shimojo S, Shams L | title = Distortions of subjective time perception within and across senses | journal = PLoS One | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = e1437 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18197248 | pmc = 2174530 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0001437 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effect can be eradicated for oddballs that are contracting or perceived to be receding from the viewer.&lt;ref name=New2009/&gt; The effect is also reduced&lt;ref name=Tse2004/&gt; or reversed&lt;ref name=vanWassenhove2008/&gt; with a static oddball presented amongst a stream of expanding stimuli.

It is common for an individual experiencing tachypsychia to have serious misinterpretations of their surroundings during the events, through a combination of their altered perception of time, as well as transient partial [[color blindness]] and [[tunnel vision]]. After the irregularly high levels of adrenaline consumed during sympathetic nervous system activation, an individual may display signs and symptoms of [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], and it is common for the person to display extreme emotional liability and fatigue, regardless of their actual physical exertion.

==Time dilation==
{{see also|Perception of time}}

===Fear and intense events===
[[File:Abraham Diepraam - peasants brawling.jpg|thumb|240px|During violent and threatening situations, people often report that things seem to take longer to happen, such as objects falling more slowly.&lt;ref name="pmid18074019"/&gt;]]
Possibly related to the [[Time perception#Oddball effect|oddball effect]], research suggests that [[time dilation|time seems to slow down]] for a person during intense events—such as a car accident, a robbery, a chase, [[skydiving]] or [[bungee jumping]], a potential predator threat or an intimacy with [[sexual partner]] (which would elicit [[sexual excitement]], which in turn release [[adrenaline]]),&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, L. A., and Bryant, R. A. (2007). How time flies: a study of novice skydivers. Behav. Res. Ther. 45, 1389–1392.&lt;/ref&gt; where they're capable of complex thoughts in what would normally be the blink of an eye caused by [[Fight-or-flight response]]. This reported slowing in temporal perception may have been evolutionary advantageous because it may have enhanced one's ability to intelligibly make quick [[Decision-making|decisions]] in moments that were of critical importance to our survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geoghagen|first1=Tom|title=Turn back the clock|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6926500.stm|publisher=BBC News Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even though observers commonly report that time seems to have moved in slow motion during these events, it is unclear whether this is a function of increased time resolution during the event, or instead an illusion created by the remembering of an emotionally salient event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-19477623 Why top sport stars might have 'more time' on the ball] by Jonathan Amos Science correspondent, [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

An Israeli research team have observed a strong time dilation effect in objects that were looming, but not the retreating, from the subjects. They theorize that the expanding discs—which mimic an approaching object—elicit [[self-referential]] processes which act to signal the presence of a possible danger. [[Anxious]] people, or those in great [[fear]], experience greater "time dilation" in response to the same threat stimuli brought on by the increased brain activity caused by [[epinephrine]], or an adrenaline rush.&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Haim, Y., Kerem, A., Lamy, D., and Zakay, D.

Choi, Live Science Contributor&lt;/ref&gt; When exposed to a threat, three-year-old children were observed to exhibit a similar tendency to overestimate elapsed time.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jan/01/psychology-time-perception-awareness-research |title= A stopwatch on the brain's perception of time |last1= Gozlan |first1= Marc |date= 2 Jan 2013 |website= theguardian.com |publisher= Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate= 4 January 2014 |name-list-format= vanc |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140104205501/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jan/01/psychology-time-perception-awareness-research |archivedate= 4 January 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19073237"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gil S, Droit-Volet S | title = Time perception, depression and sadness | journal = Behavioural Processes | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–76 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19073237 | doi = 10.1016/j.beproc.2008.11.012 | url = http://cerca.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/IMG/pdf_BP09-GilColl.pdf | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140104031908/http://cerca.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/IMG/pdf_BP09-GilColl.pdf | archivedate = 2014-01-04 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests that the effect appears only at the point of retrospective assessment, rather than occurring simultaneously with events as they happened.&lt;ref name="pmid18074019"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stetson C, Fiesta MP, Eagleman DM | title = Does time really slow down during a frightening event? | journal = PLoS One | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = e1295 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18074019 | pmc = 2110887 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0001295 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual abilities were tested during a frightening experience - a [[free fall]] - by measuring people's sensitivity to flickering stimuli. The results showed that the subjects' temporal resolution was not improved as the frightening event was occurring. Events appear to have taken longer only in retrospect, possibly because memories were being more densely packed during the frightening situation.

However, newer research from 2012 suggests that effective motor preparation (the paper giving the example of professional athletes) can indeed lead to slowed time perception, involving not memory but enhanced sensory processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hagura, Kanai, Orgs, Haggard |first1=Nobuhiro, Ryota, Guido, Patrick |title=Ready steady slow: action preparation slows the subjective passage of time |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/09/04/rspb.2012.1339 |website=rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org |publisher=The Royal Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a review of most current research on the topic by the University of Turku also supports the above results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Arstila |first1=Valtteri |title=Time Slows Down during Accidents |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384265/ |website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=University of Turku}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

People shown extracts from films known to induce [[fear]] often overestimated the elapsed time of a subsequently presented visual stimulus, whereas people shown clips known to evoke feelings of sadness or emotionally-neutral clips from weather forecasts and stock market updates showed no difference. It is argued that fear prompts a state of arousal in the [[amygdala]], which increases the rate of a hypothesised "internal clock." This could be the result of an evolved defensive mechanism triggered by a threatening situation.&lt;ref name="pmid21886610"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Droit-Volet S, Fayolle SL, Gil S | title = Emotion and time perception: effects of film-induced mood | journal = Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 33 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21886610 | pmc = 3152725 | doi = 10.3389/fnint.2011.00033 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other emotional states===
Research has suggested the feeling of [[awe]] has the ability to expand one's perceptions of time availability. Awe can be characterized as an experience of immense perceptual vastness that coincides with an increase in focus. Consequently, it is conceivable that one's temporal perception would slow down when experiencing awe.&lt;ref name="pmid22886132"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rudd M, Vohs KD, Aaker J | title = Awe expands people's perception of time, alters decision making, and enhances well-being | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 23 | issue = 10 | pages = 1130–6 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22886132 | doi = 10.1177/0956797612438731 | url = http://www.carlsonschool.umn.edu/assets/lib/assets/AssetLibrary/2012/Rudd_Vohs_Aaker_2012_psych%20science.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception of another persons' emotions can also change our sense of time. The theory of embodied mind (or cognition), as caused by [[mirror neuron]]s, helps explain how the perception of other people's emotions has the ability to change one's own sense of time. Embodied cognition hinges on an internal process that mimics or simulates another's emotional state. For example, if person #1 spends time with person #2 who speaks and walks incredibly slowly, person #1's internal clock may slow down.

Depression may increase one's ability to perceive time accurately. One study assessed this concept by asking subjects to estimate the amount of time that passed during intervals ranging from 3 seconds to 65 seconds.&lt;ref name=DepressiveRealism&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kornbrot DE, Msetfi RM, Grimwood MJ | title = Time perception and depressive realism: judgment type, psychophysical functions and bias | journal = PLoS One | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = e71585 | date = 21 August 2013 | pmid = 23990960 | pmc = 3749223 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0071585 | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0071585 | lay-url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130822090326.htm | lay-date = 22 August 2013 | lay-source = Science Daily | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140214092825/http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0071585 | archivedate = 14 February 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results indicated that depressed subjects more accurately estimated the amount of time that had passed than non-depressed patients; non-depressed subjects overestimated the passing of time. This difference was hypothesized to be because depressed subjects focused less on external factors that may skew their judgement of time. The authors termed this hypothesized phenomenon "depressive realism."&lt;ref name=DepressiveRealism/&gt;

===Sleep===
[[File:Dreams - Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|240px|A person can experience a long [[dream]] which may have seemed to go on for hours, yet, in reality, it actually lasted only a few seconds or maybe minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Holcombe, A. O. (2009). Seeing slow and seeing fast: two limits on perception. Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul. Ed.) 13, 216–221.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The perception of time is temporarily suspended during [[sleep]], or more often during [[REM sleep]]. This can be attributed to the [[altered state of consciousness]] associated with sleep where the person is kept [[Spatial disorientation|unaware of their surroundings]], which would make it difficult to remain informed of the passing of time. When the person awakes in the morning, they have the memory of going to bed the night before, but new memories are rarely made during sleep.

Therefore, upon waking up the following morning it feels as if no time has passed, but the human mind reasons that many hours have elapsed simply because it is now light outside. The passing of time is a [[theory of relativity|relative]] event brought about by observation of objects (the sun’s location, the moon, a clock's time). Without a reference point there would be no context other than day or night. So, as far as time passing faster when during sleep may be due to the lack of reference points that convince the sleeper the time has passed quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencefocus.com/article/human-body-mind/why-does-time-go-so-fast-when-you%E2%80%99re-asleep|title=Why does time go so fast when you’re asleep?|date=7 February 2016|work=BBC Science Focus|accessdate=4 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs===
[[Stimulants]] produce overestimates of time duration, whereas [[depressants]] and anesthetics produce underestimates of time duration.&lt;ref name="Rammsayer_1989"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rammsayer T | title = Is there a common dopaminergic basis of time perception and reaction time? | journal = Neuropsychobiology | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–42 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2573003 | doi = 10.1159/000118549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoactive drugs can alter the judgement of time. These include traditional psychedelics such as [[LSD]], [[psilocybin]], and [[mescaline]] as well as the dissociative class of psychedelics such as [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], [[ketamine]] and [[dextromethorphan]]. At higher doses time may appear to slow down, speed up or seem out of sequence. In 1955, British MP [[Christopher Mayhew]] took [[Mescaline|mescaline hydrochloride]] in an experiment under the guidance of his friend, Dr [[Humphry Osmond]]. On the BBC documentary ''The Beyond Within'', he described that half a dozen times during the experiment, he had "a period of time that didn't end for [him]".

Dopamine has a particularly strong connection with one's perception of time. Drugs that activate dopamine receptors speed up one's perception of time, while dopamine antagonists cause one to feel that time is passing slowly.&lt;ref name=Guardian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wittmann, Leland, Churan, Paulus |first1=Marc, David, Jan, Martin |title=Impaired time perception and motor timing in stimulant-dependent subjects |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1997301/ |website=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |publisher=NCBI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tiger Mask donation phenomenon''' is a series of [[donation]]s of ''[[randoseru]]'' (school backpacks) and other items to [[orphanage]]s around [[Japan]]. The first donation happened when someone left ten 30,000-yen backpacks at a child guidance center in [[Gunma Prefecture]] on [[Christmas Day]] in 2010. A note attached to the bags was signed "Naoto Date", the real name of the titular character of ''[[Tiger Mask]]'', a popular 1960s and 70s [[manga]] about a [[wrestler]] who fought for orphans, being raised in an orphanage himself. Since the initial donation, copycat donations have appeared around Japan at various facilities for children, ranging from more backpacks to toys, food, and monetary gifts.

==Naoto Date/Tiger Mask background==
{{Main|Tiger Mask}}

Many of the donations have been made under the name of Naoto Date, a character in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] ''[[Tiger Mask]]''. In the manga and anime, Tiger Mask (whose real name was Naoto Date) was a feared [[Heel (wrestling)|heel]] wrestler in America who was extremely vicious in the ring. However, he became a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] after returning to Japan when a young boy said that he wanted to be a villain like Tiger Mask when he grew up. The boy lived in an orphanage, the same one that Tiger Mask grew up in during his childhood. Feeling that he did not want the boy to idolize a villain, Tiger was inspired to be a heroic wrestler and fights for the children in the orphanage.&lt;ref name="ANN1starticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2010-12-27/manga/anime-hero-leaves-gifts-on-christmas-morning |title = Interest: Manga/Anime Hero Leaves Gifts on Christmas Morning |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2010-12-27 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN2tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-06/manga/anime-tiger-mask-inspires-another-gift-giver |title = Interest: Manga/Anime's Tiger Mask Inspires Another Gift-Giver |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-06 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN3rdarticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-08/manga/anime-tiger-mask-inspires-3-more-gift-givers |title = Interest: Manga/Anime's Tiger Mask Inspires 4 More Gift-Givers (Updated) |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-08 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN4tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-09/tiger-mask-manga/anime-inspires-7th-8th-donor |title = Interest: Tiger Mask Manga/Anime Inspires 7th, 8th Donor (Updated) |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-09 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN5tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-10/tiger-mask-donors-strike-again-in-8-more-cities |title = Interest: Tiger Mask Donors Strike Again in 8 More Cities |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-10 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2011-01-11/100-tiger-mask-donors-now-reported-all-over-japan |title = Interest: 100 Tiger Mask Donors Now Reported All Over Japan |publisher = [[Anime News Network]] |date = 2011-01-11 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNBlog"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/11/gifts-from-comic-heroes-help-japans-orphans/?hpt=Sbin |title = Gifts from 'comic heroes' help Japan's orphans |publisher = [[CNN]] |date = 2011-01-11 |accessdate = 2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donations==

===First donation===
On 25 December 2010, in Maebashi City, Gunma Prefecture, a child guidance center was visited by someone leaving ten 30,000-yen (about US$360) backpacks: five black backpacks wrapped with blue ribbons, and five red backpacks wrapped with pink ribbons. A card attached to the bags simply said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Please use these backpacks for the children.

''(signed)'' Naoto Date &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The backpacks were to be distributed between six orphans from six different orphanages in Gunma.&lt;ref name="ANN1starticleTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNBlog"/&gt;

===Second donation===
A second donation was found by a security guard at the [[Odawara]] Child Guidance Center in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] on 1 January 2011. Six backpacks, three black and three red, were left. A note left behind stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A New Year's gift&amp;nbsp;— Naoto Date
&lt;br&gt;
The donation of backpacks in Gunma last year moved me deeply. My heart skipped a beat when I heard the news. Thinking I might do something as well, I offer these gifts. May the Tiger Mask movement live on.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As with the ten original backpacks in Gunma, they were left with a note signed by Naoto Date. The backpacks were to be distributed to new arrivals at the local orphanages and other children that Odawara Child Guidance center serves.&lt;ref name="ANN2tharticleTM"/&gt;

===Copycat donations===
Japan has around 580 children's centers that house around 30,000 children.&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"/&gt;

As of January 11, 2011, over 100 donations inspired by Tiger Mask have been reported across Japan.&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"/&gt; After the two initial donations, many other orphanages and children's facilities began to receive copycat donations of backpacks. Some have also received toys, food, and money to help pay for new backpacks. In addition, parallels to other anime and manga concerning orphaned children have also crept into the donation phenomenon.&lt;ref name="ANN5tharticleTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN6tharticleTM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CNNBlog"/&gt;

===2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami===
Sometime during the night of March 17 - morning of March 18, three cars parked at an evacuation center in [[Yamada, Iwate|Yamadamachi]], [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]] had their tanks filled up and two 20-liter containers of [[heating oil]] were left outside the center by an unknown person. An evacuee discovered the donation upon starting his car and noticing his fuel gauge go from nearly empty to full. The evacuee noted: "We had hardly any fuel left. We were in a real pinch. I'm so grateful for the donation. I reckon it was Tiger Mask." The evacuation center noted that they would use the heating oil during the night to conserve fuel due to [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|the ongoing crisis]].&lt;ref name="TMTōhoku"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T110322002426.htm |title = 'Tiger Mask' donates gas, oil for evacuees |publisher = [[The Yomiuri Shimbun]] |date = Mar 23, 2011 |accessdate = Mar 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other child welfare offices and agencies have reported increased, anonymous donations in the aftermath of the disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jiji Press]], "March 11 catastrophe spurs return of mysterious 'Tiger Mast' philanthropic movement", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 10 January 2012, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural aspects===
Because tax benefits for charitable donations are limited in Japan, a culture of charity donations has never really taken root.  For example, the ratio of charitable donations by individuals in Japan is 52.5%, compared with 82.7% for the US.  Also, Japanese culture emphasizes modesty, which means that Japanese people are generally reluctant to do good deeds in public view.  Therefore, the Tiger Mask movement assuages both cultural inhibitions towards charitable deeds; it gives people in Japan a reason to donate while allowing them to do so anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hiragana Times]]'', "How Japanese Culture Created the Tiger Mask Movement", March 2011, Volume No. 293, pp. 18-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several donators left notes purportedly from other fictional characters from franchises outside the Tiger Mask series. Notable characters who "donated" include Rei and Kaji from ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', [[Haruhi Suzumiya (character)|Haruhi Suzumiya]], and [[Stitch (Lilo &amp; Stitch)|Stitch]].

[[Image:Toroidal coord.png|thumb|right|250px|A diagram depicting the poloidal (&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;) direction, represented by the red arrow, and the toroidal (&lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) direction, represented by the blue arrow.]]The earliest use of these terms cited by the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) is by [[Walter M. Elsasser]] (1946) in the context of the generation of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] by currents in the core, with "toroidal" being parallel to lines of latitude and "poloidal" being in the direction of the magnetic field (i.e. towards the poles).

The OED also records the later usage of these terms in the context of toroidally confined plasmas, as encountered in [[magnetic confinement fusion]]. In the plasma context, the toroidal direction is the long way around the torus, the corresponding coordinate being denoted by ''z'' in the slab approximation or &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in magnetic coordinates; the poloidal direction is the short way around the torus, the corresponding coordinate being denoted by ''y'' in the slab approximation or &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; in magnetic coordinates. (The third direction, normal to the magnetic surfaces, is often called the "radial direction", denoted by ''x'' in the slab approximation and variously &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\chi&lt;/math&gt;, ''r'', &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, or ''s'' in magnetic coordinates.)

==Toroidal and poloidal coordinates==
As a simple example from the physics of magnetically confined plasmas, consider an axisymmetric system with circular, concentric magnetic flux surfaces of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; (a crude approximation to the magnetic field geometry in an early [Tokamak] but topologically equivalent to any toroidal magnetic confinement system with nested flux surfaces) and denote the toroidal angle by &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; and the poloidal angle by &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;.
Then the Toroidal/Poloidal coordinate system relates to standard [[Cartesian_coordinate_system#Cartesian_coordinates_in_three_dimensions|Cartesian Coordinates]] by these transformation rules:

:&lt;math&gt; x  = (R_0 +r \cos \theta) \cos\zeta &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y  = s_\zeta (R_0 + r \cos \theta) \sin\zeta  &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z  = s_\theta r \sin \theta. &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = \pm 1, s_\zeta = \pm 1&lt;/math&gt;.

The natural choice [[Torus#Geometry|geometrically]] is to take &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = s_\zeta = +1&lt;/math&gt;, giving the toroidal and poloidal directions shown by the arrows in the figure above, but this makes &lt;math&gt;r,\theta,\zeta&lt;/math&gt; a left-handed curvilinear coordinate system. As it is usually assumed in setting up [http://www-fusion.ciemat.es/fusionwiki/index.php/Flux_coordinates#Flux_coordinates|''flux coordinates''] for describing magnetically confined plasmas that  the set &lt;math&gt;r,\theta,\zeta&lt;/math&gt; forms a ''right''-handed coordinate system, &lt;math&gt; \nabla r\cdot\nabla\theta\times\nabla\zeta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, we must either reverse the poloidal direction by taking &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = -1, s_\zeta = +1&lt;/math&gt;, or reverse the toroidal direction by taking &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = +1, s_\zeta = -1&lt;/math&gt;. Both choices are used in the literature.

==Kinematics in toroidal and poloidal coordinates==

To study single particle motion in toroidally confined plasma devices, velocity and acceleration vectors must be known. Considering the natural choice &lt;math&gt;s_\theta = s_\zeta = +1&lt;/math&gt;, the unit vectors of toroidal and poloidal coordinates system &lt;math&gt;\left(r,\theta,\zeta\right)&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_r = \begin{pmatrix}
    \cos\theta \cos\zeta \\
    \cos\theta \sin\zeta \\
    \sin\theta
\end{pmatrix} \quad
\mathbf{e}_\theta = \begin{pmatrix}
    -\sin\theta \cos\zeta \\
    -\sin\theta \sin\zeta \\
    \cos\theta
\end{pmatrix} \quad
\mathbf{e}_\zeta = \begin{pmatrix}
    -\sin\zeta \\
    \cos\zeta \\
    0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

according to Cartesian coordinates. The position vector is expressed as:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{r} = \left( r + R_0 \cos\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_r - R_0 \sin\theta \mathbf{e}_\theta &lt;/math&gt;

The velocity vector is then given by:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\dot{r}} = \dot{r} \mathbf{e}_r + r\dot{\theta} \mathbf{e}_\theta + \dot{\zeta} \left( R_0 + r \cos\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_\zeta &lt;/math&gt;

and the acceleration vector is:

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\ddot{r}} = \left( \ddot{r} - r \dot{\theta}^2 - r \dot{\zeta}^2 \cos^2\theta - R_0 \dot{\zeta}^2 \cos\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_r &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; + \left( 2\dot{r}\dot{\theta} + r\ddot{\theta} + r\dot{\zeta}^2\cos\theta\sin\theta + R_0 \dot{\zeta}^2 \sin\theta \right) \mathbf{e}_\theta &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; + \left( 2 \dot{r}\dot{\zeta}\cos\theta - 2 r \dot{\theta}\dot{\zeta} \sin\theta + \ddot{\zeta} \left( R_0 + r\cos\theta \right) \right) \mathbf{e}_\zeta &lt;/math&gt;

The model explains long-run economic growth as consequence of human capital accumulation.

== Background ==
Lucas approaches in a series of papers published in the 1970s were a challenge to the classic principles of [[Keynesian economics]] when he suggested an amassed version of microeconomics models and then emphasized on human capital accumulation. In his 1988 dissection, using [[Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model|Ramsey framework]] and [[Cobb–Douglas production function|Cobb-Douglas production function]] Lucas gave more attention to formal education rather than [[learning-by-doing]]. While in [[Solow–Swan model|Solow-Swan model]] human capital is constant which leads to no transitional dynamics, Lucas measures total capital as the ratio of physical to human capital, not as sum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.maplesoft.com/applications/view.aspx?sid=7170&amp;view=html|title=I like this Maple Application - The Uzawa Lucas Growth Model|website=www.maplesoft.com|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In the original paper, Lucas described the properties of both centralized and decentralized economics evolving with balanced paths.

V''flo'' considers the spatial character of the [[parameter]]s and precipitation controlling hydrologic processes, and thus improves upon lumped representations previously used in [[Hydrological modelling|hydrologic modeling]].

Quimpo, eds., American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VA., p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  V''flo'' is designed to take advantage of the spatial variability of high resolution [[Weather radar|radar rainfall]] input, [[GIS]] datasets, and hydraulic channel characteristics.  Because it is [[physics]]-based, it produces [[hydrograph]]s based on conservation equations and the hydraulics of the [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]], and can be employed in locations where there are no [[rain gauge]]s or previous modeling studies.  In addition, V''flo''’s network approach makes models scalable from upland [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] to river basins using the same [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]].

== Formulation ==
V''flo'' is suited for distributed hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and continuous operations.  V''flo'' models may be [[calibration|calibrated]] by loading precipitation maps for historical events and comparing simulated volume/peak [[hydrograph]]s to observed hydrographs.  Elevation data are taken from a [[digital elevation model]].  A vector channel representation is employed.  Parameterization utilizes digital data sets at any resolution, including [[LIDAR]] terrain data and other digital maps of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impervious area]], soils, and land use/cover.  V''flo'' is developed to utilize multi-sensor inputs from [[Weather radar|radar]], satellites, [[rain gauge]]s, or model forecasts.  The kinematic wave analogy is used to represent hydraulic conditions in a [[Drainage basin|watershed]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">The '''volunteer's dilemma''' [[game theory|game]] models a situation in which each of X players faces the decision of either making a small sacrifice from which all will benefit, or [[free rider problem|freeriding]]. 

One example is a scenario in which the electricity has gone out for an entire neighborhood. All inhabitants know that the electricity company will fix the problem as long as at least one person calls to notify them, at some cost. If no one volunteers, the worst possible outcome is obtained for all participants. If any one person elects to volunteer, the rest benefit by not doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Poundstone |title=Prisoner's Dilemma: John von Neumann, Game Theory, and the Puzzle of the Bomb |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Anchor Books |isbn=0-385-41580-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[public good]] is only produced if at least one person volunteers to pay an arbitrary cost. In this game, bystanders decide independently on whether to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the group. Because the volunteer receives no benefit, there is a greater incentive for freeriding than to sacrifice oneself for the group. If no one volunteers, everyone loses. The social phenomena of the [[bystander effect]] and [[diffusion of responsibility]] heavily relate to the volunteer’s dilemma.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Payoff matrix==
The [[payoff matrix]] for the game is shown below:

{| border cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" align="center"&gt;
|+ Volunteer's dilemma payoff matrix (example)
|
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|at least one other person cooperates 
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|all others defect
|-
!scope="row" style="color: #009"|cooperate
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
|-
!scope="row" style="color: #009"|defect
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;−10&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|}
When the volunteer's dilemma takes place between only two players, the game gets the character of the game '[[Chicken (game)|chicken]]'.
As seen by the payoff matrix, there is no dominant strategy in the volunteer’s dilemma.  In a mixed-strategy [[Nash equilibrium]], an increase in N players will decrease the likelihood that at least one person volunteers, which is a result of the [[bystander effect]].

==Examples in real life==
===The murder of Kitty Genovese===
The story of [[Kitty Genovese]] is often cited as an example of the volunteer's dilemma. Genovese was stabbed to death outside her apartment building in Queens, New York, in 1964. According to a highly influential ''New York Times'' account, dozens of people witnessed the assault but did not get involved because they thought others would contact the police anyway and did not want to incur the personal cost of getting involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weesie |first=Jeroen |year=1993 |title=Asymmetry and Timing in the Volunteer's Dilemma |journal=[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=569–590 |jstor=174269 |doi=10.1177/0022002793037003008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations have shown the original account to have been unfounded, and although it inspired sound scientific research, its use as a simplistic parable in psychology textbooks has been criticized.&lt;ref name="manning"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Manning| first = R. |author2=Levine, M |author3=Collins, A.| title = The Kitty Genovese murder and the social psychology of helping: The parable of the 38 witnesses| journal = [[American Psychologist]]| volume = 62| issue = 6| pages = 555–562|date=September 2007

===The meerkat===
The [[meerkat]] exhibits the volunteer's dilemma in nature. One or more meerkats act as sentries while the others forage for food. If a predator approaches, the sentry meerkat lets out a warning call so the others can burrow to safety. However, the altruism of this meerkat puts it at risk of being discovered by the predator.

In [[general relativity]], the '''Weyl−Lewis−Papapetrou coordinates''' are a set of [[coordinates]], used in the solutions to the [[vacuum]] region surrounding an [[axisymmetric]] distribution of [[mass–energy]]. They are named for [[Hermann Weyl]], [[T. Lewis (physicist)|T. Lewis]]&lt;!---need to confirm exactly who he is---&gt;, and [[Achilles Papapetrou]].&lt;ref&gt;Weyl, H., "Zur Gravitationstheorie," ''Ann. der Physik'' '''54''' (1917), 117–145.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. Lewis, "Some special solutions of the equations of axially symmetric gravitational fields," ''Roy. Soc., Proc.'' '''136''', 176–92 (May 2, 1932).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Papapetrou, "A static solution of the equations of the gravitatinal field for an arbitrary charge-distribution," ''Proc. R. Irish Acad.'' '''A 52''', 11 (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

Different authors define the functions of the coordinates differently.
