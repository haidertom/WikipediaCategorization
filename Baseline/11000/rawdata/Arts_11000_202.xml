Chughtai briefly learnt naqqashi from his uncle Baba Miran Shah Naqqash at a local mosque.&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt; After completing his education at the Railway Technical School, Lahore, in 1911, Chughtai joined the [[Mayo School of Arts, Lahore]], where Samarendranath Gupta, a pupil of [[Abanindranath Tagore]] was Vice-Principal. After leaving the school, he made a living for a while as a photographer and drawing teacher. He eventually became the head instructor in chromo-lithography at the Mayo School.&lt;ref name="Mitter1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Partha Mitter|title=Art and Nationalism in Colonial India, 1850–1922: Occidental Orientations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mRTtkri8E0C|accessdate=14 April 2012|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44354-8|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Letter of A. R. Chugtai to Bhai Vir Singh.jpg|thumb|Letter of Chugtai to Bhai Vir Singh]]
In 1916, Chughtai's first painting in a revivalist 'oriental' style appeared in the ''Modern Review''. He had his first exhibition in 1920 at the Punjab Fine Art Society.&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt; He also exhibited with the Indian School of Oriental Art during the 1920s, by which time he had become quite renowned. His work contributed greatly to Lahore's burgeoning modern art scene. Whilst he predominantly worked with watercolors, Chughtai was also a print-maker, perfecting his etching skills in London during visits in the mid-1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of Abdur Rahman Chughtai, 1897–1975|url=http://cmfinearts.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/abdur-rahman-chughtai-1897-1975/|publisher=Charles Moore Fine Arts}}, Retrieved 16 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt; His sketches were used in many books in Punjabi poetry by Bhai Vir Singh for illustrating his famous poems like "Kambadi Kalai" and including his famous epic "Rana Surat Singh" . Chughtai offered his gratitude to Bhai Vir Singh for becoming part of these illustrations as a young artist in his letter to him on 11.04.1929&lt;ref&gt;Abdul Rehman Chugtai's letter dtd 11/04/1929 Lahore preserved in Bhai Vir Singh Memorial House, Amritsar&lt;/ref&gt;

In his sixty years of artistic creation, Chughtai produced nearly 2000 watercolours, thousands of pencil sketches, and nearly 300 etchings and aquatints. He also wrote short stories, and articles on art. He designed stamps, coins, insignia and book covers. He was also an avid collector of miniatures and other art.&lt;ref name=Museum/&gt; He published three books of his own work: the ''Muraqqai-i-Chughtai'' (1928), ''Naqsh-i-Chughtai'' (c. 1935) and ''Chughtai's Paintings'' (1940).&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jonathan M. Bloom|author2=Sheila Blair|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=PA489|accessdate=15 April 2012|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|pages=489–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Muraqqa-i-Chughtai'' was a sumptuously illustrated edition of Mirza [[Ghalib]]'s Urdu poetry, with a foreword by Sir [[Muhammad Iqbal]]. It is regarded as the most significant work of Chughtai's career&lt;ref name="Dadi2010" /&gt; and in its time, was considered the finest achievement in book production in the country.
&lt;ref name="Venkatachalam1948"&gt;{{cite book|author=G. Venkatachalam|title=Contemporary Indian Painters|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsPaOwAACAAJ|accessdate=15 April 2012|year=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the creation of Pakistan in 1947, Chughtai came to be regarded as one of the most famous representatives of Pakistan. Chughtai’s paintings were given to visiting heads of states. [[Allama Iqbal]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Elizabeth II]] were amongst his admirers.

Chughtai's closest associate was his younger brother Abdullah Chughtai, a scholar and researcher of Islamic art.&lt;ref name="Dadi2010" /&gt; Chughtai married twice, and had two children, a son and daughter. He died in [[Lahore]] on 17 January 1975.&lt;ref name=Museum /&gt;


==Art==
Chughtai's early watercolours take off from the revivalism of the [[Bengal School of Art]] – his ''Jahanara and the Taj'', for instance, shows the influence of Abanindranath's ''The Last Moments of Shah Jahan''.&lt;ref name="Mitter1994" /&gt;  By the 1940s, he had created his own style, strongly influenced by Islamic art traditions, but retaining a feel of [[Art Nouveau]]. His subject matter was drawn from the legends, folklore and history of the Indo-Islamic world, as well as Punjab, Persia and the world of the Mughals.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of Abdur Rahman Chughtai|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1365955/Abdur-Rahman-Chughtai|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}, Retrieved 16 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdur Rahman Chughtai also designed the logo for the [[Pakistan Television Corporation]] (PTV) at the behest of its first general manager, [[Ubaidur Rahman]]. The logo has been tweaked and modified over the years since its inception but remains fundamentally the same. On Pakistan's independence day in 1951, he produced a set of 9 stamps, better known as 'Chughtai Art set'. At that time, this set was considered as the most beautiful stamps of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://artocraft.blogspot.com/2010/09/abdul-rehman-chughtai-his-paintings.html, Profile of Abdur Rahman Chughtai on artocraft.com website, Retrieved 16 Nov 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist and gallery owner [[Salima Hashmi]] deems Chughtai one of [[South Asia]]’s foremost painters.  “He was part of the movement that started in the early part of the 20th century to establish an identity indigenous to the subcontinent,” she said. “He rejected the hegemony of the [[British Colonial]] aesthetic.”{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Painting exhibits==
Chughtai's works are displayed at the [[British Museum]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the [[Peace Palace]] (in [[The Hague]]), [[United Nations Headquarters]], New York, the Kennedy Memorial in [[Boston]], the [[US State Department]] (in [[Washington, D.C.]]), President's House [[Bonn]], [[AP State Archaeology Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museums.ap.nic.in/apsm.htm |title=Andhra Pradesh State Archaeology Museum |accessdate=16 Nov 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215173442/http://museums.ap.nic.in/apsm.htm |archivedate=15 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Queen Juliana]]'s Palace in [[the Netherlands]], Emperor's Palace [[Bangkok]], President House [[Islamabad]], Governors’ Houses in [[Lahore]] and [[Karachi]], and the [[National Art Gallery, Islamabad]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11843">'''Artifact-centric business process model'''  represents an operational [[business process model|model of business processes]] in which the changes and evolution of [[business data]], or [[Business entity (computer science)|business entities]], are considered as the main driver of the processes. The artifact-centric approach, also called activity-centric or process-centric business process modeling, focuses on describing how business data is change/updated, by a particular action or task, throughout the process.

== Overview ==
In general, a process model describes activities conducted in order to achieve business goals, informational structures, and organizational resources. [[Workflow]]s, as a typical [[process modeling]] approach, often emphasize the sequencing of activities (i.e., [[control flow]]s), but ignore the informational perspective or treat it only within the context of single activities. Without a complete view of the informational context, business actors often focus on what should be done instead of what can be done, hindering operational innovations.

Business process modeling is a foundation for design and management of business processes. Two key aspects of business process modeling are a formal framework that integrates both control flow and data, and a set of tools to assist all aspects of a business process life cycle. A typical business process life cycle includes at least a design phase, concerned with the “correct” realization of business logic in a resource-constrained environment, and an operational phase, concerned with optimizing and improving execution (operations). Traditional business process models emphasize a procedural and/or graph-based paradigm (i.e., control flow). Thus, methodologies to design workflow in those models are typically process-centric. It has been argued that a data-centric perspective is more useful for designing business processes in the modern era.

Intuitively, business artifacts (or simply artifacts) are data objects whose manipulations define the underlying processes in a business model. Recent engineering and development efforts have adopted the artifact approach for design and analysis of business models. An important distinction between artifact-centric models and traditional data flow (computational) models is that the notion of the life cycle of the data objects is prominent in the former, while not existing in the latter.

== Research and history ==
Artifact-centric modeling is an area of growing interest. Nigam and Caswell&lt;ref&gt;Nigam, A. and N.S. Caswell, Business artifacts: An approach to operational specification. IBM Syst. J., 2003. 42(3): p. 428-445.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of business artifacts and information-centric processing of artifact lifecycles. Kumaran et al.'s further studies on artifact-centric business processes can be found here.&lt;ref name="BH2005"&gt;Bhattacharya, K., A model-driven approach to industrializing discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. IBM SYSTEMS JOURNAL, 2005. CCCT CCCEC(1): p. 145-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BH2007"&gt;Bhattacharya, K., et al., Towards Formal Analysis of Artifact-Centric Business Process Models, in Business Process Management. 2007. p. 288-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIU2007"&gt;Liu, R., K. Bhattacharya, and F. Wu, Modeling Business Contexture and Behavior Using Business Artifacts, in Advanced Information Systems Engineering. 2007. p. 324-339.&lt;/ref&gt; Bhattacharya&lt;ref name="BH2005" /&gt; described a successful business engagement which applies business artifact techniques to industrialize discovery processes in pharmaceutical research. Liu et al.&lt;ref name="LIU2007"/&gt; formulated nine commonly used patterns in information-centric business operation models and developed a computational model based on Petri Nets. Bhattacharya, K., et al.&lt;ref name="BH2007"/&gt; provides a formal model for artifact-centric business processes with complexity results concerning static analysis of the semantics of such processes. Kumaran et al.&lt;ref&gt;Kumaran, S., R. Liu, and F. Wu, On the Duality of Information-Centric and Activity-Centric Models of Business Processes, in Advanced Information Systems Engineering. 2008. p. 32-47.&lt;/ref&gt; presented the formalized information-centric approach to discovering business entities from activity-centric process models and transforming such models into artifact-centric business process models. An algorithm was provided to achieve this transformation automatically.

Other approaches related to artifact-centric modelling can be found in,.&lt;ref name="VAN2005"&gt;[[Van der Aalst, W.M.P.]], [[Mathias Weske|M. Weske]], and D. Grünbauer, Case handling: a new paradigm for business process support. Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering, 2005. 53(2): p. 129-162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WANG2005"&gt;Wang, J. and A. Kumar, A Framework for Document-Driven Workflow Systems, in Business Process Management. 2005. p. 285-301.&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Aalst et al.&lt;ref name="VAN2005"/&gt; provides a case-handling approach where a process is driven by the presence of data objects instead of control flows. A case is similar to the business entity concept in many respects. Wang and Kumar&lt;ref name="WANG2005"/&gt; proposed the document-driven workflow systems which is designed based on data dependencies without the need for explicit control flows. Muller et al.&lt;ref name="MULLER2007"&gt;Müller, D., M. Reichert, and J. Herbst, Data-Driven Modeling and Coordination of Large Process Structures, in On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2007: CoopIS, DOA, ODBASE, GADA, and IS. 2009. p. 131-149.&lt;/ref&gt; also introduced the framework for the data-driven modelling of large process structures, namely COREPRO. The approach reduces modelling efforts significantly and provides mechanisms for maintaining data-driven process structures.

Another related thread of work is the use of state machines to model object lifecycles. Industries often define data objects and standardize their lifecycles as state machines to facilitate interoperability between industry partners and enforce legal regulations.&lt;ref name="RYNDINA2007"&gt;Ryndina, K., J. Küster, and H. Gall, Consistency of Business Process Models and Object Life Cycles, in Models in Software Engineering. 2007. p. 80-90.&lt;/ref&gt; Redding et al.&lt;ref name="REDDING2008"&gt;Redding, G., et al., Generating business process models from object behavior models. Information Systems Management, 2008. 25(4): p. 319-331.&lt;/ref&gt; and Küster et al.&lt;ref name="KUSTER2007"&gt;Küster, J., K. Ryndina, and H. Gall, Generation of Business Process Models for Object Life Cycle Compliance, in Business Process Management. 2007. p. 165-181.&lt;/ref&gt; give techniques to generate business processes which are compliant with predefined object lifecycles. In addition, event-driven process modelling, for example, Event-driven Process Chains (EPC), also describes object lifecycles glued by events.

More recent and closely related work on artifact-centric process model can be found in.&lt;ref name="GEREDE2009"&gt;Gerede, C. and J. Su, Specification and Verification of Artifact Behaviors in Business Process Models, in Service-Oriented Computing – ICSOC 2007. 2009. p. 181-192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GEREDE2007"&gt;Gerede, C.E., K. Bhattacharya, and J. Su, Static analysis of business artifact-centric operational models. Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing and Applications, SOCA 2007, 2007: p. 133-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FRITZ2009"&gt;Fritz, C., R. Hull, and J. Su, Automatic construction of simple artifact-based business processes, in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory. 2009, ACM: St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH2009"&gt;Deutsch, A., et al., Automatic verification of data-centric business processes, in Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory. 2009, ACM: St. Petersburg, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerede and Su&lt;ref name="GEREDE2009"/&gt; developed a specification language ABSL to specify artifact behaviours in artifact-centric process models. The authors showed decidability results of our language for different cases and provided key insights on how artifact-centric view can affect the specification of desirable business properties. Gerede et al.&lt;ref name="GEREDE2007"/&gt; identified important classes of properties on artifact-centric operational models focusing on persistence, uniqueness and arrival properties. They proposed a formal model for artifact-centric operational models to enable a static analysis of these properties and showed that the formal model guarantees persistence and uniqueness.

Fritz, Hull, and Su&lt;ref name="FRITZ2009"/&gt; formulated the technical problem of goal-directed workflow construction in the context of declarative artifact-centric workflow, and develop results concerning the general setting, design time analysis, and the synthesis of workflow schemas from goal specifications. The work is among the important initial steps along the path towards eventual support for tools that enable substantial automation for workflow design, analysis, and modification. Deutsch et al.&lt;ref name="DEUTSCH2009"/&gt; introduced the artifact system model, which formalizes a business process modelling paradigm that has recently attracted the attention of both the industrial and research communities. The problem of automatic verification of artifact systems, with the goal of increasing confidence in the correctness of such business processes is also studied.

Sira and Chengfei&lt;ref name="YONGCHAREON2010"&gt;Yongchareon, S., Liu, C.: Process View Framework for Artifact-Centric Business Processes, in R. Meersman et al. (Eds.): OTM 2010, Part I. LNCS, vol. 6426, pp. 26–43. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a novel view framework for artifact-centric business processes. It consists of artifact-centric process model, process view model, a set of consistency rules, and the construction approach for building process views. The formal model of artifact-centric business processes and views, namely ACP, is defined and used to describe artifacts, services, business rules that control the processes, as well as views. They developed a bottom-up abstraction mechanism for process view construction to derive views from underlying process models according to view requirements. Consistency rules are also defined to preserve the consistency between constructed view and its underlying process. This work can be considered as one approach to the abstraction, i.e., generalization of artifact-centric business processes. The framework has also been extended to address modelling and change validation of inter-organizational business processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yongchareon|first1=Sira|title=A view framework for modeling and change validation of artifact-centric inter-organizational business processes|journal=Information Systems|date=2015|volume=47|pages=51–81|doi=10.1016/j.is.2014.07.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:BuddhaPark from Thai.jpg|thumb|200px|The top of the `pumpkin' tower in Buddha Park, seen through the trees from the Thai side of Mekong.]]
The park was started in 1958 by Luang Pu (Venerable Grandfather) [[Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat|Bunleua Sulilat]].&lt;ref name="RayHuhti2007"/&gt; Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat was a [[priest]]-[[Shamanism|shaman]] who integrated [[Hinduism]] and Buddhism.&lt;ref name="RayHuhti2007"/&gt; His unique perspective was influenced by a Hindu [[rishi]] under whom he studied in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="O'Tailan2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jock O'Tailan|title=Footprint Laos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHd2sa4IBFUC&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=18 June 2011|date=17 June 2008|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-906098-18-6|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the revolution in 1975, anxious about the repercussions of the rule of [[Pathet Lao]], he fled from [[Laos]] to [[Thailand]] where he built another sculpture park, [[Sala Keoku]] in [[Nong Khai]].&lt;ref name="CranmerMartin2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'Tailan2008"/&gt; Both parks are located right next to the Thai-Lao border (Mekong river), only a few kilometers apart from each other, and the tallest structures of the Buddha Park can actually be seen from the Thai side of Mekong. 

The statues are made of [[reinforced concrete]] and are ornate, and sometimes bizarre, in design.&lt;ref name="O'Tailan2008"/&gt; The statues appear to be centuries old, though they are not. There are sculptures of [[human]]s, [[Deity|gods]], [[animal]]s, and [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="www.visit-mekong.com"/&gt; There are numerous sculptures of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], characters of Buddhist beliefs like [[Avalokiteśvara]], and characters of [[Hindu mythology|Hindu lore]], including [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Arjuna]].&lt;ref name="RayHuhti2007"/&gt;  These sculptures were presumably cast by unskilled workers under the supervision of Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat.&lt;ref name="RayHuhti2007"/&gt; One notable sculpture resembles a giant [[pumpkin]].&lt;ref name="CranmerMartin2002"/&gt; It has three stories representing three levels - [[Hell]], [[Earth]] and [[Heaven]].&lt;ref name="CranmerMartin2002"/&gt; Visitors can enter through an opening which is a mouth of a {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall [[demon]] head}} and climb [[Stairway|staircase]]s from hell to heaven.&lt;ref name="www.visit-mekong.com"/&gt; Each story contains sculptures depicting the level.

'''''Camel (in rhythmic landscape with trees''''') [''German: '''Kamel (in rhythmischer baumlandschaft)'''''] is a painting by Swiss artist [[Paul Klee]] in the collection of the [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]] in [[Düsseldorf]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kunstsammlung.de/en/discover/collections/focuses/paul-klee.html|title=Paul Klee|date=|website=Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen|publisher=Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is one of the first Klee did in oils and is typical of the artist's interest in colour theory, draughtsmanship and musicality. It is also one of many images in Western art to use camels as subject matter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amor.cms.hu-berlin.de/~h1981d0z/pdf/2015-05-london/soas-london.pdf|title=The representation of the Camel in Western visual arts over 2000 years|last=Schwartz|first=H.J.|date=May 2015|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of the painting is based on horizontal bands dotted with circular shapes.

== Subject  ==
Camels appear in manuscripts, mosaics, sculptures and paintings. For example, camels and horses appear in illustrations to the travel memoir of [[John Mandeville]] in the fourteenth century. [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] paintings of the nineteenth century include ones by artists such as [[Carl Haag]] ("Danger in the Desert", 1867) and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] ("Street Scene, Egypt", 1869).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The memorial on the [[Victoria Embankment Gardens]] in London commemorates the [[Imperial Camel Corps Memorial|Imperial Camel Corps]] in sculpture.

The year before, Klee had produced another camel painting in oils entitled "Two Camels and a donkey" (1919).

"Camel in rhythmic landscape with trees" is considered one of a series that includes "Rythmic Tree Landcape".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paul Klee: dialogue with nature|author1=Paul Klee |author2=Ernst-Gerhard Güse |author3=Richard Verdi |publisher=Prestel|year=1991|isbn=978-3-79131-141-8|location=Munich|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar landscapes, such as "Small rhythmic landscape" were also created at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theartwolf.com/landscapes/klee-small-rhythmic-landscape.htm|title=Small Rhythmic Landscape (c1920)|date=|website=theartwolf.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'' I would like now to examine the dimensions of the object in a new light to try to show how it is that the artist frequently arrives at what appears to be such an arbitrary 'deformation' of natural forms.''

''First, he does not attach such intense importance to natural form as do so many realist critics, because, for him, these final forms are not the real stuff of the process of natural creation. For he places more value on the powers which do the forming than on the final forms themselves.''&lt;br&gt; - Paul Klee&lt;ref name=Klee/&gt;
}}

This is the period when the artist was working and teaching at the [[Bauhaus]] in Weimar under the direction of [[Walter Gropius]]. The task of teaching caused Klee to meditate on the problems of art and as a result he produced what [[Herbert Read]] called "the most profound and illuminating statement of the aesthetic basis of the modern movement in art ever made by a practising artist".&lt;ref name = Klee&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paul Klee on Modern Art|last=Klee|first=Paul|publisher=Faber and Faber|year=1958|isbn=|edition= English edition, with introduction by Herbert Read, translated by Paul Findlay.

'''Candler College''' and '''Colegio Buenavista''' were educational institutions founded in Havana, Cuba by the United States Southern [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|Methodist Episcopal Church]]. They were founded on two different dates, Candler College in 1899 and Colegio Buenavista in 1920. They both ceased to exist in 1961 when they were nationalized by the revolutionary government of Fidel Castro.&lt;ref name=Evolution&gt;{{cite web |url=http://amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oagjc001.php|title=RELIGIOUS REPRESSION IN CUBA: Its Evolution and Present Status|access-date=October 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schools intended to provide a bilingual education in Spanish and English, based on the Christian faith. They offered from the pre-school level until finishing high school to Cuban children and youth, as part of the mission of the church on the island.

Although they were administered by different dependencies of the Methodist Church of Florida (United States), these two schools developed all their activities in coordination. Candler College offered elementary education only to boys while Colegio Buenavista provided primary education for girls. Young girls enrolled in Buenavista attended secondary education programs at Candler College; they only received religion and physical education classes at the Buenavista facilities. Some of Candler's boys did the seventh and eighth grades in English at Colegio Buenavista to be able to follow the United States High School curriculum. The younger boys also went to Kindergarten along with the girls. Candler College had a boarding school for boys only. Similarly, Buenavista provided the boarding for young girls and ladies. The two schools had separate lunch services for students who did not live a short distance away from them.

In order to give its graduates and other students, the opportunity to continue university studies, at Candler College Candler University was organized in 1956, opening the Faculties of Pedagogy, Languages, Philosophy, and Letters, Pharmacy and Commercial Sciences to began in 1957.

These institutions grew in number of students and in prestige over the years until their educational work was interrupted in 1961 when the Castro regime nationalized all the private educational establishments (religious and lay).&lt;ref name=Evolution/&gt; During the years in which Candler College and Colegio Buenavista existed, both schools provided a successful service to Cuban youth preparing their students for civic life by providing, in addition to official instruction, an integral formation based on Christian, moral and patriotic values. 
==History==
[[File:Students. Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left]]
The first Methodist school in Cuba was founded in 1899 by the American missionary Thad E. Leland on Calle Virtudes de [[La Habana]]. This was founded when the Bishop of the Methodist Church of Florida, the Rev. Warren Akin Candler, proposed to give a new impetus to the missionary work begun in Cuba in 1883, through educational projects. In 1903 this school was named Candler College in honor of Bishop Candler.&lt;ref&gt;Tamayo Pérez, Marbelito y García Hernández, Belkis. Iglesia Metodista de Cuba. Reseña histórica 1883–2007. La Habana, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverend H. B. Bardwell, a missionary in Cuba since 1903, succeeded the reverends E.E Clements and B.F. Gilbert as director of Candler College in 1909. Aware of the need to expand, the Mission Board of the Florida Conference acquired a vast tract of land in La Ceiba, Marianao, where the first building for the new headquarters was built in 1912 of the school, inaugurated in January 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Bardwell, Harry B. An epoch-making event. En [http://books.google.com/books?id=SoqaAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=leyland+%22candler+college%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8w2LiCZ2OQ&amp;sig=z3rRw6SmLEyVfFQc4xQCdcoxQeE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=AjuATNG8H4OB8gaz4tzrAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, the school in Havana and the new headquarters functioned under the same name until they were organized as independent colleges. The headquarters of Havana was called Central Methodist College and that of Marianao retained the name Candler College. In addition to offering elementary and secondary education, between 1924 and 1946 at Candler College, a theological seminary was held, the School of Pastors, which was under the direction of the Reverend B. F. Gilbert followed by the Reverend E.E, Clements.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez Ramos, Carlos. ''Un resumen de los setenta años de labor de la iglesia metodista en Cuba.''  Libro publicado en 1983. No se indican ciudad ni editorial.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reverend Bardwell directed Candler College for forty years, during which the spirit of the college was consolidated. He was replaced in 1949 by the Reverend Carlos Pérez Ramos, who had been assistant director since 1946. Under his direction, the school continued to grow and other buildings and facilities were built to meet new requirements.

Colegio Buenavista was founded in 1920 by the Women's Missionary Board of the Methodist Church to provide a Christian education for girls and young women and to respond to the request of the parents of Candler College students who demanded an education for their daughters. quality similar to that of his brothers. This women's school began to operate in a residence surrounded by gardens that acquired the church across the street Miramar, along the side of the Candler.&lt;ref&gt;Haskin, Sarah Estelle.  ''Women and missions in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South''. Publishing House of the M.E. Church,South. Nashville,1923.  http://www.archive.org/stream/womenandmissions00haskuoft#page/160/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to offering primary education for girls, between 1926 and 1938 in Buenavista worked a Normal School that prepared hundreds of teachers, directed by Dr. Luis Alonso.

Until 1960, the directors of Colegio Buenavista were American missionaries who had carried out evangelization and social work for the Methodist Church in different parts of the island. Under his direction the school grew at the same pace as Candler College. Miss Belle Markey, the first director, was followed by Miss Junia Jones and then by Miss Ione Clay, who held the position for more than 25 years, until her retirement in 1956, and was replaced by Miss Juanita Kelly, who was succeeded by Miss Lorraine Buck. Four months before the nationalization of the school, the Reverend Humberto Carrazana, pastor of the Methodist Church of Marianao, was named director of Colegio Buenavista.&lt;ref name=Recuerdos&gt;{{cite news | first = Mercedes| last = Cil Rivero| title =Mis Recuerdos del Colegio Buenavista.| url = https://www.facebook.com/groups/candlercollege/doc/10150849356720693| via = Facebook | accessdate = November 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For several decades, the schools were considered among the best in Cuba and "many graduates were accepted in the best universities in the United States without taking admission exams."&lt;ref name="Pérez Ramos_1"&gt;Pérez Ramos, Carlos.

==Location, buildings and facilities==
[[File:Areal View. Candler College and Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|]]
Candler College was located in the southeastern corner of the intersection of Miramar (Calle 54) and Gutiérrez (Ave. 43) in La Ceiba, Marianao. Candler's main entrance was down Gutiérrez Street (Ave.43) and gave access to the gardens in the front part of the main building, where the offices were on the ground floor and the bedrooms for the pupils in the second and third floors. Through this entrance, taking to the left, were the Martian Corner and the two-story building where the High School classes were held. At the back of this building, which opened onto Calle Lanuza (Calle 52), an entrance was opened for the students of Candler University. There were three other entrances on Calle Miramar (Ave. 54): one that was used to enter the Chapel, the next allowed the entrance of cars to the esplanade and parking place; this entrance had on the right the two-story building of the School of Commerce, with its well-equipped classrooms and spacious corridors, and to the left was the Library building, which also had two floors. Surrounding the esplanade were the back of the main building with its long corridors, the front of the High School building, the dining room and kitchen with the apartment for the director on the second floor and the three-story building that occupied the School of Baccalaureate, with its laboratories and the Museum of Natural Sciences, in addition to classrooms. Separated by a fence, was the field for sports, the squash court and beyond the ground and the ballpark. The third entrance was the building of the Elementary School, in front of Font Street (Ave. 45). On the opposite side of the street, there was another sports field on the corner of 54th Street and 45th Ave. The Gymnasium, with its modern wooden plank for playing basketball and indoor volleyball and a stage at the back, was It was located in the southwest corner of 56th Street and 45th Ave.
[[File:Buenavista a color.jpg|thumb|left|El edificio principal de Buenavista on 54th Street]]
Colegio Buenavista was located in front of the entrances on the side of Candler, on the southwestern corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue.&lt;ref name=Recuerdos/&gt;
The main Buenavista building had three entrances on Calle Miramar (Calle 54): the first was a gate to enter the main building, the beautiful mansion that was adapted to the initial needs of the school. On the ground floor were: the materials room, the kitchen, the dining room, and two classrooms. On the facade there were two converging stairs on a large terrace that gave access to the offices, the library, and the hall, from where a corridor led to the infirmary, the bedrooms and bathrooms for the pupils and the director, on the second floor.&lt;ref name=Recuerdos/&gt; On the third floor, there were more bedrooms for the older pupils and the missionaries. To the left of this building, there was an entrance for cars, gardens, a garage, and a small room. A hallway to the left led to the classrooms, lined along 54th Street and 45th Ave, which limited the large courtyard with its gardens. This included recreational areas, the platform for cultural activities, the Martian Corner and, on the other side, the tennis and volleyball court. A third entrance to the gardens of Calle Miramar led to a vestibule that separated a small religious meditation room and a classroom and the long corridor that gave access to the other classrooms. There was also an entrance through the back of the patio, on Calle Primelles (Calle 56). Crossing this street, a small door allowed to enter the sports ground for the students of Buenavista. The Auditorium of both schools was built next to this land, located in the south-western corner of 56th Street and 43rd Ave. Diagonal to this, in the northeast corner, with the entrance by Ave. 43, was the building of two stories with a smaller playground for students from pre-school to third grade.

Both schools in total occupied a vast lot whose area of more than 32,000 square meters was bounded by 45th Ave to the south, 52nd Street to the east, 58th Street to the west and 43rd Ave to the north. This large area was crossed by three streets: Calle 54, Ave. 45 and Calle 56, which separated the buildings of the schools and the sports grounds, the gymnasium, and the auditorium.

==Basics==
Candler College and Buenavista College were grounded in the creed and discipline of the Methodist church. They were opened to prepare students for their future life outside of school on the basis of Christian faith and practice as well as moral, civic and patriotic values. Its purposes were to provide a comprehensive education that would contribute to the personal development of students as individuals and members of society and raise the educational level of the newly founded republic.
===Methodist approach===
[[File:Candler College Chapel. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Candler College Chapel. Corner of 54th Street and 43rd Avenue]]
According to the thought of John Wesley, a good education was considered "one of the best ways to transform individuals, communities and societies as a whole" for their betterment and the glory of God. Education was not only the acquisition of academic knowledge but also wisdom and humility, which was founded on the teachings of Christ, in order to grow intellectually, personally and spiritually. The search for truth was encouraged through reason, research and debate, based on freedom of thought and expression. High academic standards were promoted as well as the development of talents through varied activities. As a result, challenges were posed to students, they were inspired and supported to achieve their best through self-discipline and a strong work ethic.

Candler and Buenavista maintained a distinctive approach to education that incorporated Christian ethical values. The Methodist Social Creed emphasizes interest in social welfare and justice as well as the need to combat prejudice and intolerance in whatever form they take by strengthening mutual respect and understanding.&lt;ref name="Pérez Ramos_1" /&gt; So tolerant attitudes and behaviors were reinforced, respectful and non-discriminatory.

It was hoped that students would learn to differentiate good and evil based on Christian and moral values. Family values based on love and mutual understanding and support were an important part of the formation of students.

High ideals of patriotism were present in the education of the students: love their homeland and be loyal to it, respect and honor the national emblems and recognize the merits of the main forgers of the nation, know its history, culture and traditions as well as the achievements of the newly created republic and interested in the needs and problems of its people and their efforts to solve them.

The civic values of freedom and democracy and the norms of coexistence related to rights and duties had a central place in the task of preparing future citizens as well as inculcating good manners and the appropriate habits required to live in society.

The strong ties with the Florida Methodist Church Conference, which partially supported both colleges, were evident in the influence of American culture and traditions in schools. The flag of the United States was present in all the parties and ceremonies along with the Cuban flag and the national anthems of the two countries were sung.

==Hymns and emblems==
The principle adopted by Candler College as a guide was Consilio et Prudentia (Wisdom and Prudence). The motto of Colegio Buenavista, which appears on his seal, was Esse quam Videri (Ser instead of appearing). The pennants of Candler College bore the distinctive colors of the school, red and black. Those of Buenavista the orange and the black. The hymns of the schools were the following:
[[File:Sello de Candler.jpg|thumb|left|Logo Candler College]]

==Academic structure==
[[File:Faculty. Candler College and Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|The Faculty]]
Candler College consisted of four schools, each coordinated by a sub-director:

* Elementary School, which included a pre-primary education degree and seven primary education grades (the latter was called preparatory). At the end of the sixth grade students could enter the Baccalaureate if they passed in any of the public secondary schools the official entrance exam that was required.
* Baccalaureate school, high school in Spanish, which comprised five years. In the latter, students could choose between two branches: Science and Letters. The students left prepared to continue studies of higher education in the different careers that were offered in the country at the university level.
* School of Commerce, consisting of two different branches: Accountant and Secretariat, which initially were programs of three years each. But from the course of 1957–58 Contador was extended to four years. Upon completion of studies in these programs, students were prepared to enter the world of work in commercial enterprises or where office work would be required.
* High School in English, which consisted of four years of secondary education that prepared the student to continue studies of higher education in the United States.

Colegio Buenavista offered preschool (Kindergarten and Pre-primary) and primary education in Spanish and English from first to eighth grades. Her students continued secondary education at Candler College.

The curriculum corresponded to the graduate school model adopted in Cuba at the beginning of the twentieth century, which implies the progressive nature of the teaching-learning process so that the contents of the [[Course (education)|subjects]] were sequenced progressively from pre-school to secondary education.

Candler College and Buenavista followed the official programs for the Primary School and the Bachillerato proposed by the Cuban Ministry of Education, which determined in a precise way the contents for the subjects of each grade in the Study Plans, as well as the time required for each one. The teachers selected the [[textbooks]] and the materials among those prepared by authors Cubans. Primary Education in Spanish and the Baccalaureate had official recognition, as there were supervisors from the Ministry of Education who periodically visited the primary school classes. The Baccalaureate School was incorporated the Secondary Education Institute of Marianao, so that the students had to present exams of each subject before professors of this institute twice a year to obtain the [[accreditation]] of their results, and at the end, the [[diploma]] official that would allow them to enter the university. In the School of Commerce the professors prepared the study plans. The textbooks and materials were selected by them among those offered by the publishing houses and were available in the [[bookstores]]. The curricula for the High School followed the curriculum of the United States and the texts were brought from there. The schedules, the spaces and the didactic resources were conceived and managed in coordination by the sub-directors and teachers. They were autonomous to conduct the teaching-learning process. Each teacher was free to choose the teaching methods and teaching materials he or she considered most convenient for each subject and was responsible for the [[evaluation]] of the students, including the [[observation]] of their difficulties and needs in order to improve their performance. Grades or grades were reported monthly to the parents of the students.

Religious education was important in both schools. The Bible classes were part of the curriculum in all grades. The students not only read the history and teachings of Jesus and the [[apostles]] in the [[New Testament]], they also learned about the history of the [[Hebrew people]], their leaders, [[prophets]], and other characters; they also learned the [[Ten Commandments]] and read the [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] in the [[Old Testament]]. Worshiping God and [[praying]] were part of the student's formation. Twice a week the students of Buenavista and the boys of Candler in the Chapel met separately, where the word of God was preached and topics related to spiritual, moral, civic and patriotic values were discussed.

== Extracurricular activities ==
Students at both schools had opportunities to supplement their academic instruction through a number of sports and various extracurricular activities:
=== Sports ===
[[File:Deportes en Candler.jpg|thumb|left]]
Athletics and sports were always practiced in Candler. In the beginning, the favorite sports were tennis and baseball along with the [[training]] field and track. Later, students also practiced [[softball]], basketball, volleyball, and squash instead of tennis. Some students could participate in teams that were specially trained to compete in the intercollegiate championships. They won many trophies in baseball and basketball.

The girls also played sports at Buenavista: softball, kickball, volleyball and basketball. Teams were trained with the best players to also participate in intercollegiate competitions.

=== Music ===
In Buenavista there was a Music Department that, in addition to the regular music classes included in the curricula, offered piano and [[solfeggio]] and [[music theory]] lessons. The students could take these classes in their [[free time]] or at the end of the school day each day. The annual [[Recital]] was a tradition of many years, in which the students who took piano lessons played a piece of classical music. In this one also participated the Rhythmic Band.

In the decades of 1940 and 1950 there was also a school band that participated in stops or patriotic celebrations and played the National Anthem during the salute to the flag.

In addition, [[choirs]] were specially prepared to participate in [[festivals]] and other celebrations.

Since 1958 a choir was organized with students from both schools.

=== Other extracurricular activities ===
[[File:Colegio Buena Vista. Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left]]
At different times, some groups of students interested in literature, musical appreciation, theater, [[Rhetoric|oratory]], or the publication of a newspaper were organized, guided by a teacher or counselor.

The [[excursions]] were traditional opportunities to visit places near the school or historical or recreational places in different parts of the country.

At Candler College, there was also a troop of [[Asociación de Scouts de Cuba|Boy Scouts]].

In addition, festivals, bazaars, theatrical performances, Christmas celebrations and others that were part of the annual planning of school activities were organized.

== Student body ==
Candler College and Colegio Buenavista were open to all children and young people without further requirements, who, apart from paying the monthly fee, committed to respecting their standards. Some students were scholarship two for the church and some parents got a reduction in the tuition for their children's education.

The two schools did not admit exclusively Methodist or Protestant students. The majority of the students were [[Catholic]] and there were also some students [[Jews]]. Due to the good level in the teaching of the English language, Candler and Buenavista were chosen by many parents of students [[Alien (law)|foreigners]]{{clarify|date=November 2018}} who lived in Cuba.

In the sixty-two years of existence of Candler College and forty-one of Buenavista, many thousands of students left the schools prepared to continue their studies or enter the world of work and become good citizens. They were equipped with solid foundations of religious faith and moral values to cope with life after school.

=== Alumni Associations ===

The Candler Fraternity was the association of graduates and alumni of Candler College. The former students of Buenavista belonged to the Association of Former Students of Colegio Buenavista.

Many alumni and teachers of Candler and Buenavista left their country in the early 1960s when the revolution that took power in 1959 turned to [[communism]]. Others emigrated later. The majority went to live in the United States, concentrating on the largest number in Florida. Some of those who have been in contact have met on different occasions to remember the old times and reaffirm the spirit of the schools that they all share.

The former students of Candler and Buenavista who remained in Cuba have formed the Candler-Buenavista Fraternity and meet annually since 1999.

[[File:Timbre penny post Canada 1898.jpg|thumb|This Canadian stamp's Christmas connection is in the "XMAS 1898" at the bottom of the map.]]
A '''Christmas stamp''' is a [[postage stamp]] with a [[Christmas]] theme, intended for use on seasonal mail such as [[Christmas card]]s. Many countries of the world issue such stamps, which are regular postage stamps (in contrast to [[Christmas seal]]s) and are usually valid for postage year-round (in some countries they have a discounted value and are for use exclusively on Christmas cards). They usually go on sale some time between early October and early December, and are printed in considerable quantities.

==History==
It is a matter of some debate as to which is the first Christmas stamp.  The [[Canada|Canadian]] map stamp of 1898 bears an inscription "XMAS 1898", but it was actually issued to mark the inauguration of the [[Imperial Penny Post]]age rate. The Christmas connection has long been reported to have been the result of quick thinking; [[William Mulock]] was proposing that it be issued on 9 November, to "honor the Prince" (meaning the [[Prince of Wales]]), but when [[Queen Victoria]] asked "what Prince?" in a displeased manner, Mulock realized the danger, and answered "Why, madam, the [[Prince of Princes|Prince of Peace]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael O. Nowlan |url=http://www.psestamp.com/articles/article1087.chtml |title=Michael O. Nowlan, "How The First Christmas Stamp Came To Be" |publisher=Professional Stamp Experts |date=1999-07-14 |accessdate=2015-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222141355/http://www.psestamp.com/articles/article1087.chtml |archivedate=2015-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:British Troops in Egypt, Christmas stamp 1935.jpg|right|thumb|British Troops in Egypt Christmas stamp, 1935]]In 1935, [[British Armed Forces|British Forces]] troops stationed in Egypt were issued with a Christmas stamp for their mail home. For many years these were not included in the Stanley Gibbons catalogues, as they classified them as a “seal” rather than a postage stamp, but they have been properly included since the mid-1960s as they prepaid postage and so, despite the inscription "Letter stamp", are normal stamps, and should therefore be counted as the first stamp issued expressly to mark Christmas. Like the slightly earlier Silver Jubilee overprints on the “sphinx” stamp, the Christmas stamps were issued in booklet form in panes of 20.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gbos.org.uk/index.php/Country_List/13 www.gbos.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stamp HU 1943 20f Xmas.jpg|right|thumb|Hungarian nativity stamp, 1943]]
In 1937, [[Austria]] issued two "Christmas greeting stamps" featuring a [[rose]] and [[zodiac]] signs. In 1939, [[Brazil]] issued four [[semi-postal]] stamps with designs featuring the [[Three Wise Men|three kings]] and a star, an [[angel]] and child, the [[Southern Cross]] and a child, and a mother and child. In 1941 [[Hungary]] also issued a semi-postal whose additional fees were to pay for "soldiers' Christmas".  The first stamps to depict the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] were the Hungary issue of 1943. These were all one-time issues, more like [[commemorative stamp]]s than regular issues.

[[File:Stamp AU 1957 4p Xmas.jpg|thumb|First Christmas stamp of Australia, 1957]]

The next Christmas stamps did not appear until 1951, when [[Cuba]] issued designs with [[poinsettia]]s and bells, followed by [[Haiti]] (1954), [[Luxembourg]] and [[Spain]] (1955), then [[Australia]], [[Korea]], and [[Liechtenstein]] (1957). In cases such as Australia, the issuance marked the first of what became an annual tradition. Many more nations took up the practice during the 1960s, including the [[United States]] (1962) and [[United Kingdom]] (1966).

By the 1990s, approximately 160 postal administrations were issuing Christmas stamps, mostly on an annual basis. [[Islami]]c countries constitute the largest group of non-participants, although the [[Palestinian Authority]] has issued Christmas stamps since 1995.

==Designs==
[[File:Stamp Peru 1970 1.20s Xmas.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Peru's 1970 stamps reproduced paintings by anonymous Peruvian artists.]]

Although some tropical islands produce large-format Christmas stamps primarily intended for sale to [[stamp collector]]s, for the rest of the world, Christmas stamps are "working stamps" that will be used in large numbers to send greeting cards and postcards.  Accordingly, the stamps tend to be normal-sized, and offered in one or a few denominations, for instance to cover differing domestic and international rates.

The choice of designs is highly variable, ranging from an overtly religious image of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]], to secular images of [[Christmas tree]]s, [[wreath]]s, [[Santa Claus]], and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1466893/Secular-Christmas-stamps-attacked.html&lt;/ref&gt; A country may maintain a unified theme for several years, then change it drastically, in some cases seemingly to follow "fashion moves" by other countries. For instance, during the 1970s many countries issued Christmas stamps featuring children's drawings, with the young artist identified by name and age.

The choice of secular or religious designs is frequently a bone of contention in some countries; church leaders often see secular designs as diluting the meaning of the holiday, while postal officials fear that overly religious designs could lead their secular or minority-religious customers to avoid the stamps, leaving millions unsold, and even expose the postal administration to charges that they are violating laws prohibiting the promotion of a particular religion.

In the United States, annual discord over "secular" versus "religious" designs was eventually resolved by the [[United States Postal Service|Postal Service]] issuing some of each per year; typically a group of 4-6 related secular designs, plus a religious design (usually depicting the [[Madonna and Child]]). To avoid difficulties attendant upon contracting for original designs with a religious theme, the latter have typically been adapted from [[Old Master]] paintings hanging in U.S. galleries, thus qualifying as depictions of art. (In 2012, 2014, and 2016, however, religious-themed stamps were issued featuring original designs depicting the [[flight into Egypt]], the journey of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], and the [[Nativity of Jesus]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/news/national-releases/2012/pr12_113.htm |title=U.S. Postal Service Issues Holy Family Forever Stamp |publisher=USPS |date=2012-10-10 |accessdate=2015-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2014/pb22400/html/info_008.htm |title=Stamp Announcement 14-48: Christmas Magi Stamp |publisher=USPS |date=2014-10-16 |accessdate=2015-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.usps.com/postal-bulletin/2016/pb22451/html/info_005.htm| |title=Stamp Announcement 16-42: Nativity Stamp |publisher=USPS |date=2016-09-29 |accessdate=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;) In the United Kingdom, the [[Royal Mail]] resolves the difficulty by issuing "religious" and "secular" themed designs in alternate years.

==Usage==
The usual usage of Christmas stamps is to quickly apply them to a stack of Christmas cards to go out. In the age of email, Christmas stamps may represent some individuals' largest remaining use of stamps in a year, and it is not unusual to see "leftovers" appear on regular mail during the first months of the new year. In Australia and the [[Netherlands]], Christmas stamps are sold at a discount, but can be used after Christmas with additional stamps to make up the correct rate.

==Collecting==
Christmas is a popular theme for [[topical collecting]]. Because of the quantities printed, almost all Christmas stamps are easy to come by and of negligible cost. Collecting challenges would therefore be to get [[Cover (philately)|covers]] with apropos [[postal marking]]s, such as a postmark on Christmas Day (not all post offices get the day off), or from a particular location (such as [[Christmas Island]]; [[Christmas, Florida]]; [[North Pole, Alaska]]; [[North Pole, New York]]; or [[Santa Claus, Indiana]]), or bearing a specific Christmas theme or slogan.

The Christmas Philatelic Club was formed in 1969 by Christmas stamp collectors and issues a quarterly journal, the ''[[Yule Log]]''. A number of collectors treat Christmas collecting as a subcategory of religion on stamps.

==Other holiday stamps==
{{main|Holiday stamp}}
In Japan, there is a longstanding tradition of a New Years stamp.  A number of Easter stamps have been issued, but these are clearly aimed at collectors.

The United States has occasionally issued stamps for other holidays, such as [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[New Year's Day]].  During the 1990s, stamps for [[Kwanzaa]], [[Hanukkah]], [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]], and [[Chinese New Year]] have become a regular part of the holiday program, although the designs tend to be used for several years, distinguishable only by a different denomination or year date.

[[Holiday stamp#Saint Valentine's Day stamp|Valentine's Day stamps]] are a more recent tradition in some countries.

=== Tristimulus colorimeter ===
{{main|Tristimulus colorimeter}}
In [[digital imaging]], colorimeters are tristimulus devices used for [[color calibration]]. Accurate [[ICC Profile|color profiles]] ensure consistency throughout the imaging workflow, from acquisition to output.

=== Spectroradiometer, spectrophotometer, spectrocolorimeter ===
The absolute [[spectral power distribution]] of a light source can be measured with a ''spectroradiometer'', which works by optically collecting the light, then passing it through a [[monochromator]] before reading it in narrow bands of wavelength.

Reflected color can be measured using a ''spectrophotometer'' (also called ''spectroreflectometer'' or ''reflectometer''), which takes measurements in the visible region (and a little beyond) of a given color sample. If the custom of taking readings at 10 [[nanometer]] increments is followed, the [[visible light]] range of 400-700&amp;nbsp;nm will yield 31 readings. These readings are typically used to draw the sample's [[reflectivity|spectral reflectance]] curve (how much it reflects, as a function of wavelength)—the most accurate data that can be provided regarding its characteristics.

[[Image:CRT_phosphors.png|thumb|CRT phosphors]]
The readings by themselves are typically not as useful as their [[tristimulus]] values, which can be converted into [[chromaticity]] co-ordinates and manipulated through [[color translation|color space transformations]].  For this purpose, a ''spectrocolorimeter'' may be used. A spectrocolorimeter is simply a spectrophotometer that can estimate tristimulus values by [[numerical integration]] (of the [[color matching function]]s' [[inner product]] with the illuminant's spectral power distribution).&lt;ref name=schanda/&gt; One benefit of spectrocolorimeters over tristimulus colorimeters is that they do not have optical filters, which are subject to manufacturing variance, and have a fixed spectral transmittance curve—until they age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorimeter vs. Spectro|volume=2|issue=3|work=Colorsync-users Digest|accessdate=2008-05-06|author=Andreas Brant, GretagMacbeth Corporate Support|date=2005-01-07|url=http://lists.apple.com/archives/Colorsync-users/2005/Jan/msg00118.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, tristimulus colorimeters are purpose-built, cheaper, and easier to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colorimeter vs. Spectro|volume=2|issue=3|work=Colorsync-users Digest|accessdate=2008-05-06|author=Raymond Cheydleur, X-Rite|date=2005-01-08|url=http://lists.apple.com/archives/Colorsync-users/2005/Jan/msg00120.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE (International Commission on Illumination)]] recommends using measurement intervals under 5&amp;nbsp;nm, even for smooth spectra.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; Sparser measurements fail to accurately characterize spiky emission spectra, such as that of the red phosphor of a CRT display, depicted aside.

=== Color temperature meter ===
[[Photographer]]s and [[cinematographer]]s use information provided by these meters to decide what [[Color balance|color balancing]] should be done to make different light sources appear to have the same color temperature. If the user enters the reference color temperature, the meter can calculate the [[mired]] difference between the measurement and the reference, enabling the user to choose a corrective [[color gel]] or [[photographic filter]] with the closest mired factor.&lt;ref name=fpe&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl|last=Salvaggio|title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography: Digital Imaging, Theory and Application|publisher=[[Focal Press]]|editor=Michael R. Peres|year=2007|page=741|edition=4E|isbn=0-240-80740-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYyldcYfq3MC&amp;pg=RA1-PA741&amp;lpg=RA1-PA741&amp;dq=three+silicon+photodiodes+%22color+temperature%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Planckian-locus.png|thumb|The normals are lines of equal correlated color temperature.]]
Internally the meter is typically a [[silicon photodiode]] tristimulus colorimeter.&lt;ref name=fpe/&gt; The [[correlated color temperature]] can be calculated from the tristimulus values by first calculating the [[chromaticity]] co-ordinates in the [[CIE 1960 color space]], then finding the closest point on the [[Planckian locus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1916">A '''colourant'''/'''colour additive''' (British spelling) or '''colorant'''/'''color additive''' (American spelling) is a substance that is added or applied in order to change the [[colour]] of a  material or surface. Colourants can be used for many purposes including [[printing]], [[painting]], and for colouring many types of materials such as [[food colouring|foods]] and [[plastic colorant|plastics]]. Colourants work by absorbing varying amounts of [[light]] at different [[wavelength]]s (or [[frequencies]]) of its [[visible spectrum|spectrum]], transmitting (if translucent) or reflecting the remaining light in straight lines or [[Light scattering|scattered]].  

Most colourants can be classified as [[dye]]s or [[pigment]]s, or containing some combination of these.  Typical dyes are largely translucent, while pigments are made up of solid particles and are partially or entirely opaque. These properties may change when other common ingredients such as [[Binder (material)|binders]] and [[Filler (materials)|fillers]] are added, for example in [[paint]]s and [[ink]]s. In addition, some colourants impart colour through reactions with other substances.

Colourants, or their constituent [[chemical compound|compounds]], may be classified chemically as [[inorganic]] (often from a mineral source) and [[organic compound|organic]] (often from a [[biological pigment|biological]] source).

== Regulation ==

=== United States ===

In the US, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates colourants for food safety and accurate labeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm094211.htm#coloradd|title=Overview of Food Ingredients, Additives &amp; Colors|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1590">'''Configuration design''' is a kind of [[design]] where a fixed set of predefined components that can be interfaced (connected) in predefined ways is given, and an assembly (i.e. designed artifact) of components selected from this fixed set is sought that satisfies a set of requirements and obeys a set of constraints.

The associated ''design configuration problem'' consists of the following three constituent tasks:
# '''Selection''' of components,
# '''Allocation''' of components, and
# '''Interfacing''' of components (design of ways the components interface/connect with each other).

Types of knowledge involved in configuration design include:

* Problem-specific knowledge:
** Input knowledge:
*** Requirements
*** Constraints
*** Technology
** Case knowledge
* Persistent knowledge (knowledge that remains valid over multiple problem solving sessions):
** Case knowledge
** Domain-specific, method-independent knowledge
** Method-specific domain knowledge
** Search-control knowledge

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10198">[[File:Opera Dardanella ad p15.JPG|thumb|300px|Advertisement for a Dardanella performance, 1929]]
'''Dardanella''' was a touring theatre company from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day Indonesia) established by Willy A. Piedro in 1926. Arising from a background of [[musical theatre]], the troupe focused on realistic stories, both adaptations of foreign works and original [[stage play]]s about life in the Indies. Starring Dewi Dja' and Tan Tjeng Bok, the troupe performed original works by Piedro and [[Andjar Asmara]]. Popular both in the Indies and abroad, Dardanella dissolved during an international tour after 1936. Several of its members later went into film.

==Background==
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the theatre in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day Indonesia) generally emphasised music, with the dialogue being sung. These early performances were given different names depending on their type, such as ''[[bangsawan]]'' and ''komedi stambul''. In the mid-1920s companies in the country began adapting more European stylings, with an emphasis on spoken dialogue and a reduction in the amount of music used during the performance; troupes using this new format referred to the genre as ''[[toneel]]'', an adaptation of the Dutch word for theatre.{{sfn|Cohen|2003|pp=215–217}}{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=338}}

==Career==
[[File:Dr Samsi advertisement, Doenia Film October 1931 p14.jpg|thumb|300px|Advertisement for the premiere of ''Dr Samsi''; the play became Dardanella's most popular.]]
Dardanella was established by Willy A. Piedro (born Willy Klimanoff), a [[Penang]]-born actor of Russian descent. His [[Native Indonesians|native]] wife, Dewi Dja' (also spelled Devi), joined as an actor; another early member was Tan Tjeng Bok, an ethnic Chinese ''[[keroncong]]'' singer who was known for his sword work, Ferry Kock, and [[Astaman]];{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=14, 17}} many of these actors had been in other troupes before.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=348}} The troupe gave their first performance on 21&amp;nbsp;June 1926 in [[Sidoarjo]], [[East Java]].{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} They were advertised as a ''toneel'' troupe to indicate their affinity for European stage traditions.{{sfn|Cohen|2006|p=338}}

Initially the troupe's works were written by Piedro. He adapted numerous [[Hollywood]] productions for the stage, including ''[[The Mark of Zorro (1920 film)|The Mark of Zorro]]'' (1920), ''[[The Three Musketeers (1921 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' (1921), ''[[The Thief of Bagdad (1924 film)|The Thief of Bagdad]]'' (1924), and ''[[Don Q, Son of Zorro]]'' (1925). These adaptations generally starred Tan Tjeng Bok, who earned the nickname "[[Douglas Fairbanks]] of [[Java]]" ("{{lang|nl|Douglas Fairbanks van Java}}") for his work.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=14, 17}} Piedro also wrote his own stage plays based on everyday life in the Indies (mostly in Java), such as ''Roos van Serang'', ''Fatima'', and ''North of Borneo''.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=14, 17}}

The group attracted the theatre and film critic [[Andjar Asmara]] in November 1930; he left his publication ''Doenia Film'' to join as he believed the troupe dedicated to the betterment of the ''toneel'' as an art form and not only motivated by financial interests like the earlier ''stambul'' troupes.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=6, 14, 20}} Andjar's wife [[Ratna Asmara|Ratna]] also joined.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} He numerous wrote stage plays for the troupe, generally dealing with more serious and mature topics than Piedro; these were in part aimed at the growing [[intellectualism|intellectual]] native population.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=6, 14, 20}}

Dardanella began losing its popularity in the early 1930s.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=24}} In 1936 Dardanella went to India to record a film adaptation of Andjar's ''Dr Samsi'', which followed a doctor who was blackmailed after an unscrupulous [[Indo people|Indo]] discovered he had an illegitimate child.{{sfn|Said|1982|pp=136–138}}{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=23}} This plan was not brought to fruition, and afterwards Piedro, Dja', and some thirty-odd players went to the United States via Egypt and Europe, soon disbanding.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}}{{sfn|Salim 2008, Dardanella}} Meanwhile, Andjar and Ratna Asmara returned to the Indies, establishing their own troupe named Bollero with [[Bachtiar Effendi]], who had joined Dardanella shortly before its dissolution.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}}{{sfn|Said|1982|p=138}}

In the 1940s numerous former Dardanella actors and personnel entered the film industry, including Andjar and Ratna Asmara,{{sfn|Said|1982|p=138}} as well as Ferry Kock and his wife Dewi Mada.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=204}} Several stage plays used by the troupe were also adapted to film, including ''[[Rentjong Atjeh]]'' (''Rencong of Aceh''; 1940),{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=210}} and ''[[Gadis Desa]]'' (''Maiden from the Village''; 1949).{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}}

==Style and reception==
Their plays were presented in [[Malay language|Malay]] and often adapted works by other writers.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} Some works, such as those by [[Victor Ido]], were translated from the original when adapted for stage.{{sfn|JCG, Dardanella}} Dardanella and its contemporary rival [[Miss Riboet's Orion]]&amp;nbsp;– established a year before&amp;nbsp;– were some of the first travelling troupes in the Indies to use original works; earlier ''[[bangsawan]]'' and ''stambul'' troupes had used broad outlines of foreign works.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=6}}{{sfn|Salim 2008, Dardanella}} The two were the most popular troupes from the Indies of their time.{{sfn|Salim 2008, Dardanella}}

A review in ''[[The Straits Times]]'' following a performance of ''The Worshippers of Papua'' in 1935 found the troupe's performances comparable to those of European theatrical acts and notes that large European audiences attended the shows. The reviewer described the show as "entertaining [audiences] in a way they had never been entertained before".{{sfn|The Straits Times 1935, Patrons}}

The Indonesian cultural critic Hairus Salim HS notes that Dardanella's use of Malay in a time of [[Indonesian National Awakening|increased nationalism]] worked to unite the different peoples of the [[Indonesian archipelago|archipelago]] with a single language; he also cites the diverse cultural background of its players as presenting a single but varied Indonesian identity.{{sfn|Salim 2008, Dardanella}}

'''''David Garrick as Richard III''''' is a painting dating from 1745 by the English artist [[William Hogarth]].

The painting shows the actor and stage manager [[David Garrick]] in the role of [[Richard III of England|Richard&amp;nbsp;III]] in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard&amp;nbsp;III]]''.  It depicts a dramatic moment in the play on the eve of the [[Battle of Bosworth]]. The king, who had been asleep in his tent on the battlefield, has just woken from a dream in which he has seen the ghosts of the opponents he had previously murdered.{{sfn|Perry|1999|p=124}} Hogarth was a friend of Garrick, who had gained a degree of fame through his portrayal of Richard&amp;nbsp;III at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]] in London. The painting shows the actor with fear and concern, one arm raised and with a shocked expression on his face.{{sfn|Perry|1999|p=124}}

Hogarth, best remembered for his [[satire|satirical]] prints on social themes, was also a skilled painter and portraitist. This painting, much more than just a portrait, shows the subject at a key time in history, and also in theatrical pose. It falls between the commonly accepted [[genre]]s of portraiture and historical painting. The pose used by Hogarth was similar to other that used for other portraits of actors, especially those by [[Johann Zoffany|Zoffany]]. Having compared Hogarth's painting with those of Garrick by [[Joshua Reynolds|Reynolds]], Gill Parry concludes that Hogarth had helped to establish a new subgenre within portraiture, that of the theatrical portrait.{{sfn|Perry|1999|pp=124–139}} The pose adopted by the actor was described by Hogarth as "the serpentine line"; he saw it as "being composed of two curves contrasted". In his 1753 treatise ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]'' he suggests that this is a particularly beautiful shape which "gives play to the imagination and delights the eye".{{sfn|Perry|1999|p=160}}

The painting is in [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and measures {{convert|190.5|cm|in|1}} by {{convert|250.8|cm|in|1}}. It is owned by the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England, and was purchased by the gallery in 1956 with help from the [[The Art Fund|National Art Collections Fund]].{{sfn|Walker Art Gallery|1994|p=47}}

[[File:De Constantia (titelpagina, 1584).png|thumb|right|''De Constantia'' (1584)]]
'''''De Constantia in publicis malis''''' ('''On constancy in times of public evil''') was a philosophical dialogue published by [[Justus Lipsius]] in two books in 1583. The book, modelled after the dialogues of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], was pivotal in establishing an accommodation of [[Stoicism]] and [[Christianity]] which became known as [[Neostoicism]]. ''De Constantia'' went through over eighty editions between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.

==Themes==
Unlike his later books which synthesised the basic principles of [[Stoicism]] (albeit in Christianised form), in ''De Constantia'' Lipsius focuses on Stoicism's value in strengthening the mind against external troubles and anxieties.&lt;ref name="long"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Long|first=A. A.|year=2003|contribution=Stoicism in the Philosophical Tradition|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Stoics|editor-last=Inwood|editor-first=Brad|pages=381-2|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521779855}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an [[European wars of religion|age of religious disputes]] and persecutions Lipsius intended the book to be both a consolation and a solution to the calamities which he and his contemporaries were enduring.&lt;ref name="papy"&gt;Jan Papy, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justus-lipsius/#2 Justus Lipsius], ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''. Accessed 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a handbook for practical living, and as such is focused more on moral rules than rigorous philosophical argument.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; Lipsius emphasises that the mind and the inner life is the site of true goodness.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; The central theme of the book is the need to cultivate voluntary and uncomplaining endurance of all human contingencies.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;

==Legacy==
''De Constantia'' was Lipsius' most popular work.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; Between the 16th and the 18th centuries, it went through more than eighty editions, of which over forty were in the original Latin and the rest were translations into vernacular European languages.&lt;ref name="papy"/&gt;

'''''Django Unchained''''' is a 2012 American [[revisionist Western]] film written and directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]], starring [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Christoph Waltz]], [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], [[Kerry Washington]], and [[Samuel L. Jackson]], with [[Walton Goggins]], [[Dennis Christopher]], [[James Remar]], and [[Don Johnson]] in supporting roles.  Set in the [[American frontier|Old West]] and [[Antebellum era#Antebellum era (1781–1860)|Antebellum]] [[Southern United States|South]], it is a highly [[Stylization|stylized]] tribute to [[Spaghetti Western]]s, in particular the 1966 Italian film ''[[Django (1966 film)|Django]]'' by [[Sergio Corbucci]], whose star [[Franco Nero]] has a [[cameo appearance]].

Development of ''Django Unchained'' began in 2007 when Tarantino was writing a book on Corbucci. By April 2011, Tarantino sent his final draft of the script to The Weinstein Company. Casting began in the summer of 2011, with [[Michael K. Williams]] and [[Will Smith]] being considered for the role of the title character before Foxx was cast. Principal photography took place from November 2011 to March 2012 in California, Wyoming and Louisiana.

''Django Unchained'' premiered at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre (1969)|Ziegfeld Theatre]] in New York City on December 11, 2012, and was released on December 25, 2012, in the United States. The film was nominated for several film industry awards, including five [[Academy Awards]]. Waltz won several awards for his performance, among them Best Supporting Actor at the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Golden Globes]], [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|BAFTAs]], and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Awards]]. Tarantino won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award]], a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay|Golden Globe]], and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Original Screenplay|BAFTA]] award for writing the film's original screenplay. The film grossed over $425 million worldwide in theaters against its $100 million budget, making it Tarantino's highest-grossing theatrical release.

==Plot==
In 1858 [[Texas]], brothers Ace and Dicky Speck drive a group of shackled [[Slavery in the United States|black slaves]] on foot. Among them is [[Django (character)|Django]], sold off and separated from his wife {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}&lt;!--Not "Brunhilde." Broomhilda is the correct spelling of this character's name.--&gt; von Shaft, a [[house slave]]. The brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz, a German [[dentist]]-turned-[[bounty hunter]] who asks to buy one of the slaves. He questions Django about his knowledge of the Brittle brothers, a trio of [[outlaw]]s for whom Schultz is carrying a warrant. When the suspicious Ace levels his gun at him, Schultz kills him with a [[fast draw]] and then kills Dicky's horse, which falls and crushes Dicky's leg. Schultz insists on paying Dicky a fair price for Django before leaving Dicky to the newly freed slaves, who kill him and follow the [[Polaris|North Star]] to freedom. As Django can identify the Brittle brothers, Schultz offers him his freedom in exchange for help tracking them down.

They track the Brittles to the [[Tennessee]] plantation of Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett and kill them. Bennett musters a large gang to raid their camp in the night; Schultz ambushes them with an explosive, killing most of them while Django kills Bennett. Feeling morally obliged to Django, Schultz agrees to help him find and rescue {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}. Schultz trains Django as his apprentice, and the two become partners. Django soon collects his first bounty, keeping the [[wanted poster|handbill]]&lt;!--referred to as such multiple times in the movie.--&gt; for good luck.

In 1859, Django and Schultz travel to [[Mississippi]] where they learn the identity of {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}'s new owner: Calvin J. Candie, the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]], where slaves are forced to fight to the death in brutal wrestling matches called "Mandingo fights". Schultz and Django meet Calvin at his gentleman's club in [[Greenville, Mississippi|Greenville]], and offer $12,000 for one of his best fighters; however, their ulterior motive is to purchase {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}. Intrigued, Calvin invites them to Candyland.

The group encounters Calvin's slave trackers en route: cornering one of Calvin's disfigured Mandingo fighters, D'Artagnan, who tried to escape to avoid fighting again. Angered, Calvin has several attack dogs devour D'Artagnan alive. After finding {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} and telling her of their plan, Schultz offers to buy her while negotiating the initial deal during dinner. Calvin's staunchly loyal house slave, Stephen, becomes suspicious and accurately deduces their plan. He alerts Calvin, who alters the deal at gunpoint so that {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} will be sold for $12,000 instead of the Mandingo fighter. Schultz agrees, and the papers for her freedom are drawn up and signed. Calvin smugly insists that the deal be sealed through a handshake; Schultz, sick of Calvin's cruelty, shoots him through the heart with his [[Sleeve gun|concealed]] [[derringer]], killing him. Schultz is killed by Calvin's bodyguard, who is then killed with his own [[revolver]] by Django. A shootout ensues, and Django kills many of Calvin's henchmen. When he runs out of ammunition, Stephen tells Django to surrender or Broomhilda will be killed; he surrenders.

The next morning, Stephen tells Django that Calvin's sister Lara has taken charge, and that he will be sold to a mine and worked to death. En route, Django proves to his escorts that he is a bounty hunter by showing them his first handbill, tells them that the men on the handbill are back at Candyland, and promises them all but $500 of the reward money if they free him and help him kill the wanted men. The escorts release him and give him a revolver, which he immediately uses to kill them before stealing a horse and returning to Candyland with a bag of [[dynamite]]. Django kills Calvin's slave trackers, takes {{not a typo|Broomhilda}}'s freedom papers from Schultz's corpse, and frees his wife from a nearby cabin.

When Calvin's mourners return from his burial, Django kills Lara and the remaining henchmen, releases the two remaining house slaves, and [[kneecapping|kneecaps]] Stephen before igniting the dynamite that he has planted throughout the mansion. Django and {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} watch from a distance as the mansion explodes, killing Stephen, before riding off together.

[[File:Quentin Tarantino Django 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tarantino in Paris at the film's French premiere, January 2013]]
In 2007, Tarantino discussed an idea for a type of [[Spaghetti Western]] set in the United States' pre-Civil War [[Deep South]]. He called this type of film "a Southern", stating that he wanted: {{cquote|to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like Spaghetti Westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hiscock |first=John |date=April 27, 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3664742/Quentin-Tarantino-Im-proud-of-my-flop.html |title=Quentin Tarantino: I'm proud of my flop |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=April 16, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: {{cquote|I was writing a book about [[Sergio Corbucci]] when I came up with a way to tell the story.&amp;nbsp;... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with [[fascism]]. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [this] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'{{thinsp}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/07/14/django-unchained-comic-con-panel-tarantino-talks-links-to-other-movies-don-johnson-talks-foghorn-leghorn/|title='Django Unchained' Comic-Con panel: Tarantino talks links to other movies, Don Johnson talks Foghorn Leghorn|last=Franich|first=Darren|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 14, 2012|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tarantino finished the script on April 26, 2011, and handed in the final draft to [[The Weinstein Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Child |first=Ben |title=Tarantino's Django Unchained script: The word is out |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/may/05/quentin-tarantino-django-unchained-script |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=September 16, 2012 |date=May 5, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, frequent Tarantino collaborator [[RZA]] said that he and Tarantino had intended to [[Fictional crossover|cross over]] ''Django Unchained'' with RZA's Tarantino-presented martial-arts film ''[[The Man with the Iron Fists]].'' The crossover would have seen a younger version of the blacksmith character from RZA's film appear as a slave in an auction. However, scheduling conflicts prevented RZA's participation.&lt;ref name="Cross-Over"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lyttleton |first=Oliver |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/rza-would-have-played-his-character-from-the-man-with-the-iron-fists-in-django-unchained-20121022 |title=RZA Would Have Played His Character From 'The Man with the Iron Fists' In 'Django Unchained' |work=[[IndieWIRE]] |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BiG7O7CW?url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/rza-would-have-played-his-character-from-the-man-with-the-iron-fists-in-django-unchained-20121022 |archivedate=October 26, 2012 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title ''Django Unchained'' alludes to the titles of the 1966 Corbucci film ''Django''; ''[[Hercules Unchained]]'', the American title for the 1959 Italian epic fantasy film ''Ercole e la regina di Lidia,'' about the mythical hero's escape from enslavement to a wicked master; and to ''[[Angel Unchained]]'', the 1970 American biker film about a biker exacting revenge on a large group of [[rednecks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/8765553/quentin-tarantino-django-unchained-slavery-spaghetti-western|author= Zach Baron|title=Cinemetrics: Quentin Tarantino's History Lesson: The hilarious but painfully dark truths of 'Django Unchained'|publisher=Grantland.com|date= December 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2012/12/in-honor-of-django-unchained-a-look-at-a-dozen-spaghetti-westerns-worth-your-time.html/ |title='&amp;#39;In honor of "Django Unchained," a look at a dozen Spaghetti Westerns worth your time'&amp;#39 |first=Howery |last=Pack |work=[[Dallas Morning News]] |date=December 26, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105120309/http://popcultureblog.dallasnews.com/2012/12/in-honor-of-django-unchained-a-look-at-a-dozen-spaghetti-westerns-worth-your-time.html/ |archivedate=January 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costume design===

[[File:The Blue Boy.jpg|thumb|upright|Django's valet costume was inspired by [[Thomas Gainsborough]]'s 1770 oil painting, ''[[The Blue Boy]]''.]]
In a January 2013 interview with ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', costume designer [[Sharen Davis]] said much of the film's wardrobe was inspired by spaghetti westerns and other works of art. For Django's wardrobe, Davis and Tarantino watched the television series ''[[Bonanza]]'' and referred to it frequently. The pair even hired the hatmaker who designed the hat worn by the ''Bonanza'' character Little Joe, played by [[Michael Landon]]. Davis described Django's look as a "rock-n-roll take on the character". Django's sunglasses were inspired by [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[The White Buffalo]]'' (1977). Davis used [[Thomas Gainsborough]]'s 1770 oil painting ''[[The Blue Boy]]'' as a reference for Django's valet outfit.&lt;ref name="Costume"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hanel |first=Marnie |date=January 4, 2013 |title=From Sketch to Still: The Spaghetti-Western Wit of Sharen Davis's Django Unchained Costumes |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2013/01/django-unchained-costume-design-oscar-nomination |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=January 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final scene, {{not a typo|Broomhilda}} wears a dress similar to that of [[Ida Galli]]'s character in ''[[Blood for a Silver Dollar]]'' (1965). Davis said the idea of Calvin Candie's costume came partly from [[Rhett Butler]], and that Don Johnson's signature ''[[Miami Vice]]'' look inspired Big Daddy's cream-colored linen suit in the film. King Schultz's faux chinchilla coat was inspired by [[Telly Savalas]] in ''[[Kojak]]''. Davis also revealed that many of her costume ideas did not make the final cut of the film, leaving some unexplained characters such as Zoë Bell's tracker, who was intended to drop her bandana to reveal an absent jaw.&lt;ref name="Costume" /&gt;

''Django Unchained'' was the first Tarantino film not edited by [[Sally Menke]], who died in 2010.

The film also features a few famous pieces of [[western classical music]], including [[Beethoven's]] "[[Für Elise]]" and  "Dies Irae" from [[Verdi's Requiem]].

In a scholarly essay on the film's music, [[Hollis Robbins]] notes that the vast majority of film music borrowings come from films made between 1966 and 1974 and argues that the political and musical resonances of these allusions situate ''Django Unchained'' squarely in the Vietnam and Watergate era, during the rise and decline of Black Power cinema.&lt;ref&gt;“''Django Unchained'': Repurposing Western Film Music.” ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17533171.2015.1057022 Safundi]: the Journal of South African and American Studies'' 16:3 (August 2015): 280-290.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jim Croce]]'s hit "[[I Got a Name (song)|I Got a Name]]" was featured in the soundtrack.

==Reception==

===Critical and scholarly response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 87% based on 262 reviews and an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Bold, bloody, and stylistically daring, ''Django Unchained'' is another incendiary masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino."&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |title= Django Unchained |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/django_unchained_2012/ |work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher= [[Flixster]] |accessdate= December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 81 out of 100 based on 42 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Django Unchained |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/django-unchained |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate= December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film four stars out of four and said: "The film offers one sensational sequence after another, all set around these two intriguing characters who seem opposites but share pragmatic, financial and personal issues." Ebert also added, "had I not been prevented from seeing it sooner because of an injury, this would have been on my year's best films list."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2013/01/django_unchained.html |title=Faster, Quentin!

To the contrary, [[Owen Gleiberman]], film critic for the ''Entertainment Weekly'', wrote: "''Django'' isn't nearly the film that ''Inglourious'' was.

An entire issue of the academic journal ''Safundi'' was devoted to ''Django Unchained'':{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} "''Django Unchained and the Global Western''," featuring scholars who contextualize Tarantino's film as a classic "western". Dana Phillips writes: "Tarantino's film is immensely entertaining, not despite but because it is so very audacious—even, at times, downright lurid, thanks to its treatment of slavery, race relations, and that staple of the Western, violence. No doubt these are matters that another director would have handled more delicately, and with less stylistic excess, than Tarantino, who has never been bashful. Another director also would have been less willing to proclaim his film the first in a new genre, the 'Southern'."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Dana. "Introduction: Django Unchained and the Global Western".

===Controversies===
====Portrayal and descriptions of African-Americans and slavery====
Some commentators have felt that the film's heavy usage of the word "[[nigger]]" is inappropriate, affecting them to an even greater extent than the depicted violence  against the slaves.&lt;ref name="Surviving Django"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/roxanegay/surviving-django-8opx|title= Surviving 'Django'|work= [[BuzzFeed]]|date= January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviewers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|title=Django Unchained: Film Review|date=December 11, 2012|first=Todd|last=McCarthy|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/django-unchained/review/399663}}&lt;/ref&gt; have defended the usage of the language in the historic context of race and slavery in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Django Unchained and Race: Here's What Drudge Doesn't Tell You|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/12/django_unchaine.php|work=The Village Voice|accessdate=December 18, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216005936/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/12/django_unchaine.php|archive-date=December 16, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor and activist [[Jesse Williams (actor)|Jesse Williams]] has contrasted accuracy of the racist language used in the film with what he sees as the film's lack of accuracy about the general lives of slaves, too often portrayed as "well-dressed Negresses in flowing gowns, frolicking on swings and enjoying leisurely strolls through the grounds, as if the setting is Versailles, mixed in with occasional acts of barbarism against slaves&amp;nbsp;...

Samuel L. Jackson told Vogue Man that "''Django Unchained'' was a harder and more detailed exploration of what the slavery experience was than ''12 Years a Slave'', but director Steve McQueen is an artist and since he’s respected for making supposedly art films, it’s held in higher esteem than ''Django'', because that was basically a blaxploitation movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://mattpomroy.com/2018/04/04/samuel-l-jackson-cover-story/|title=Samuel L Jackson cover story|date=2018-04-04|work=MATT POMROY|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Use of violence====
Some reviews criticized the film for being too [[Media violence research|violent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dershowitz |first=Jessica |title="Django Unchained": Critics weigh in on Quentin Tarantino film |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57560737/django-unchained-critics-weigh-in-on-quentin-tarantino-film/ |publisher=CBS News|accessdate=December 26, 2012|date=December 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The originally planned premiere of ''Django'' was postponed following the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook school shooting]] on December 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Battersby |first=Matilda |title='Give me a break' – Tarantino tires of defending ultra-violent films after Sandy Hook massacre |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/give-me-a-break--tarantino-tires-of-defending-ultraviolent-films-after-sandy-hook-massacre-8422467.html |work=[[The Independent]]|date=December 17, 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Frank]] criticized the film's use of violence as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino has lately become the focus for this sort of criticism (about the relationship between the movies and acts of violence). The fact that ''Django Unchained'' arrived in theaters right around the time of the Sandy Hook massacre didn't help. Yet he has refused to give an inch in discussing the link between movie violence and real life. Obviously I don't think one has to do with the other. Movies are about make-believe. It's about imagination. Part of the thing is trying to create a realistic experience, but we are faking it. Is it possible that anyone in our cynical world credits a self-serving [[sophism|sophistry]] like this? Of course an industry under fire will claim that its hands are clean, just as the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] has done – and of course a favorite son, be it Tarantino or [[Wayne LaPierre|LaPierre]], can be counted on to make the claim louder than anyone else. But do they really believe that imaginative expression is without consequence?&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Frank|Frank, Thomas]] (March 2013) "Blood Sport." ''[[Harper's Magazine]];'' page 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Independent]]'' said the movie was part of "the new sadism in cinema" and added, "There is something disconcerting about sitting in a crowded cinema as an audience guffaws at the latest [[Garrote|garroting]] or falls about in hysterics as someone is beheaded or has a limb lopped off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McNabb, Geoffrey |date=January 11, 2013|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/django-unchained-and-the-new-sadism-in-cinema-8446213.html |title=Django Unchained and the 'new sadism' in cinema|work=The Independent|access-date=February 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Serwer from ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' said, "''Django'', like many Tarantino films, also has been criticized as cartoonishly violent, but it is only so when Django is killing slave owners and overseers. The violence against slaves is always appropriately terrifying. This, if nothing else, puts ''Django'' in the running for Tarantino's best film, the first one in which he discovers violence as horror rather than just spectacle. When Schultz turns his head away from a slave being torn apart by dogs, Django explains to Calvin Candie—the plantation owner played by Leo DiCaprio—that Schultz just isn't used to Americans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Serwer, Adam |date=January 7, 2013|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2013/01/tarantino-django-unchained-western-racism-violence|title=In Defense of Django|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical inaccuracies====
&lt;!--This is not a general trivia section. This section is meant to showcase issues that were brought up in the surrounding media coverage and reception related to the movie. Please see talk page first. --&gt;
Although Tarantino has said about Mandingo fighting, "I was always aware those things existed", there is no definitive historical evidence that slave owners ever staged [[gladiator]]-like fights to the death between male slaves like the fight depicted in the movie.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez |first=Rene |title=Tarantino talks 'Django Unchained' |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/12/21/3152097/tarantino-talks-django-unchained.html |work=[[The Miami Herald]] |date=December 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223005411/http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/12/21/3152097/tarantino-talks-django-unchained.html |archivedate=February 23, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web |title=Was There Really "Mandingo Fighting," Like in Django Unchained? |url= http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/12/24/django_unchained_mandingo_fighting_were_any_slaves_really_forced_to_fight.html |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Edna Greene Medford]] notes that there are only undocumented rumors that such fights took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/is-mandingo-fighting-a-real-thing/|title='Django' Unexplained: Was Mandingo Fighting a Real Thing? - NextMovie|work=NextMovie|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Blight, the director of Yale's center for the study of slavery, said it was not a matter of moral or ethical reservations that prevented slave owners from pitting slaves against each other in combat, but rather economic self-interest: slave owners would not have wanted to put their substantial financial investments at risk in gladiatorial battles.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;

The non-historical term "Mandingo" for a fine fighting or breeding slave comes not from Tarantino, but the earlier film ''[[Mandingo (film)|''Mandingo'']]''.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Bernardi, The Persistence of Whiteness: Race and Contemporary ...- 2013 "For the purposes of breeding chattel, he must also buy a "Mandingo" buck, a male slave. In the film, a "Mandingo" represents the finest stock of slaves deemed most suitable for fighting and breeding."{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', [[William Jelani Cobb]] observed that Tarantino's occasional historical elasticity sometimes worked to the film's advantage. "There are moments," Cobb wrote, "where this convex history works brilliantly, like when Tarantino depicts the [[Ku Klux Klan]] a decade prior to its actual formation in order to thoroughly ridicule its members' veiled racism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cobb|first=Jelani|title=Tarantino Unchained|work=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2013/01/how-accurate-is-quentin-tarantinos-portrayal-of-slavery-in-django-unchained.html|date=January 2, 2013|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tarantino holds that the masked marauders depicted in the film were not the KKK, but a group known as "The Regulators". They were depicted as spiritual forebears of the later post-civil war KKK and not as the actual KKK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holslin|first=Peter|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/quentin-tarantino-and-cast-reveal-django-details-at-comic-con-20120714|title=Quentin Tarantino and Cast Reveal 'Django' Details at Comic-Con|date=July 14, 2012|accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Nolan|work=Screenprism|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/is-django-unchained-historically-accurate-and-does-it-matter|title=Q: Is "Django Unchained" historically accurate and does it matter?|date=July 7, 2015|accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the matter of historical accuracy, [[Christopher Caldwell (journalist)|Christopher Caldwell]] wrote in the ''Financial Times'': "Of course, we must not mistake a feature film for a public television documentary", pointing out that the film should be treated as entertainment, not as a historical account of the time period it is set in. "''Django'' uses slavery the way a pornographic film might use a nurses' convention: as a pretext for what is really meant to entertain us. What is really meant to entertain us in ''Django'' is violence."&lt;ref name="Tarantino's crusade to ennoble violence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/fb2e5468-55b7-11e2-bdd2-00144feab49a.html|title= Tarantino's crusade to ennoble violence|work=[[Financial Times]]|date= January 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Brody, however, wrote in ''The New Yorker'' that Tarantino's "vision of slavery's monstrosity is historically accurate....

==In other media==

===Miniseries===
Tarantino has said in an interview that he has 90 minutes of unused material and considered re-editing ''Django Unchained'' into a four-hour, four-night cable [[miniseries]]. Tarantino said that breaking the story into four parts would be more satisfying to audiences than a four-hour movie: "...it wouldn't be an endurance test. It would be a mini-series. And people love those."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/05/23/quentin-tarantino/9483365/|title=Tarantino wants to make 'Django' TV mini-series|last=Alexander|first=Bryan |work=USA Today|date=May 24, 2014|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novels===
The story which became the director's follow-up film ''[[The Hateful Eight]]'' was first attempted as a paperback novel sequel to Django Unchained titled ''Django in White Hell''. Tarantino decided, however, that the character's established morals did not fit the tone of the developing story so he began re-writing it as an original screenplay with no connection to the earlier film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/11/quentin-tarantino-hateful-eight-django-novel |title=Quentin Tarantino explains how Hateful Eight began as a Django novel |last=Staskiewicz |first=Keith |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|location =US |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=January 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has expressed a desire to write a series of Django sequel novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/quentin-tarantino-ridley-scott-four-846682 |title=Quentin Tarantino, Ridley Scott, Four More Directors on the Decline of "Middle-Class Films," Facing Retirement |last=Galloway|first=Stephen |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|location =US |date=December 10, 2015 |accessdate=January 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===
Sony is planning on a Django/[[Zorro]] crossover movie, which currently exists in the form of a comic book by [[Dynamite Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/django-unchained-zorro-crossover-movie-2014-12|title=Sony Is Apparently Working On A 'Django Unchained'/'Zorro' Crossover Movie With Quentin Tarantino|last=Acuna|first=Kirsten|work=Business Insider|date=December 15, 2014|accessdate=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamite.com/htmlfiles/viewProduct.html?PRO=C72513022349401011|title=Dynamite® Django / Zorro #1|accessdate=January 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cameo===
In the 2014 film ''[[A Million Ways to Die in the West]]'', Django is seen shooting the proprietor of a racially charged shooting game, saying "people die at the fair". Despite his appearance, the film has no serious connection with Tarantino film and is used mostly for parody and humor.

==Alleged copyright infringement==
In December 2015, a $100 million lawsuit was filed against Tarantino by filmmakers Oscar Colvin Jr. and Torrance J. Colvin, who claimed that the script for ''Django Unchained'' bears extensive similarities to their film, titled ''Freedom''. The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thewrap.com/quentin-tarantino-django-unchained-100-million-lawsuit-hateful-eight/ | title=Quentin Tarantino Slapped With $100 Million-Plus Copyright Lawsuit Over ‘Django Unchained’ | work=The Wrap | date=December 30, 2015 | accessdate=January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/31/quentin-tarantino-django-unchained-copyright-lawsuit | title=Quentin Tarantino sued for alleged Django Unchained copyright infringement | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=December 31, 2015 | accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 24, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/10213341/COLVIN_et_al_v_TARANTINO_et_al|title=COLVIN et al v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4927">Although elements of '''fashion design copyright''' may be traced in Europe to as early as the 15th century, &lt;ref name= salmon/&gt; as of [[as of|2016]] most countries (including the United States and the United Kingdom) [[fashion design]] does not have the same protection as other creative works (art, film, literature, etc.), because [[apparel]] (clothes, shoes, handbags, etc.) are classified as "functional items", excluded from protection by [[copyright law]]s. This explains the success of the [[knockoff]] businesses to the detriment of both the established labels, as well as of emerging designers, the latter ones being especially damaged, because they rely on relatively few designs.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314&gt;[https://www.businessoffashion.com/community/voices/discussions/what-is-the-real-cost-of-copycats/fashions-copycat-economy "What are the consequences of copycats?"], by Helena Pike, March 14, 2016, ''Business of Fashion''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
French king [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] &lt;ref name= salmon&gt;Salmon, J.H.M. "Francis I (France)." Encyclopedia. Issues &amp; Controversies. Facts On File News Services, n.d. Web. 4 Mar. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; gave out specific privileges related to the production of textiles. By 1711, in Lyon, illegalities were already being defined in regards to fashion materials, and in 1787, in England and Scotland fashion designers had fruitfully pushed their needs for protection into basic legislation. In 1876 Germany began protecting fashion patterns as well as models, and in 2002 European regulation on designs that were new and provided an aspect of fresh character or aesthetic were brought under protection.&lt;ref&gt;(Fischer Par. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004 to 2006 the “total production volume for clothing decreased by about 5% each year… [and by] 2006 the European union trade deficit for clothing was at 33.7 billion.”&lt;ref&gt;(Fischer Par. 2)&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics show that while there are benefits of their advanced design legislation, the economic and external factors still hindered their industry growth in ways the U.S. can empathize with. As 2007 came to a close, WIPO, or the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], had registered twenty-nine international designs.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Fridolin. “Design Law in the European Fashion Sector” WIPO February 2008. Web. 10 Feb 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current regulation==
There are some elements of protection of fashion design, with limited effectiveness.  The copyright law covers creative elements of fashion designs, such as print patterns. [[Trademark law]] protects items with visibly displayed protected [[logo]]s. [[Intellectual property]] laws protect "[[trade dress]]", which is an appearance of a product which uniquely identifies its source to the level of a trademark.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314/&gt;

Some countries introduced other laws to protect fashion design, however the protection is inconsistent around the world.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314/&gt;

===European Union===
In the [[European Union]], the Creative Designs Directive and the European Designs Directive are in effect to protect new designs for three or five years.&lt;ref name=BoF20160314/&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Fashion design copyright in the United States}}
As of late 2015, fashion designs were not subject to copyright laws in the United States, and could not be copyrighted.&lt;ref&gt;"Protection for Fashion Design", Statement of the United States Copyright Office  before the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property, Committee on the Judiciary, United States House of Representatives, 109th Congress, 2nd Session, July 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Fashion Design and Copyright in the US and EU", Michele Woods and Miyuki Monroig, Copyright Law Division, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), Geneva, November 17, 2015. Web 25 Sep 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Several bills named [[Design Piracy Prohibition Act]] and some other similar ones attempted to introduce protection of [[apparel]].

== Societal impact ==
Resercher Johanna Blakley argues that the very lack of regulation of fashion design has allowed the fashion industry to do very well economically and has lead to the birth of [[fast fashion]] and a much faster changing of [[fashion trend]]s and has enabled pieces of clothing to become pieces of art. She also refers to [[Tom Ford]] pointing out that the people who buy cheap lookalikes are a different [[demography|demographic]] compared with people who buy the original very high end products and that while many exclusive designers get copied, also the high end designers often attribute the inspiration of their creations to following street fashion so the copying is a [[win-win game|two way street]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/talks/johanna_blakley_lessons_from_fashion_s_free_culture Johanna Blakley: Lessons from fashion&amp;#39;s free culture] TED Talk, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Government College of Fine Arts''' (initially known as the '''Madras School of Art''') in [[Chennai]] is the oldest art institution in [[India]]. The institution was established in 1850 by surgeon Alexander Hunter as a private art school. In 1852, after being taken over by the government, it was renamed as the Government School of Industrial Arts.&lt;ref name=h&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fr/2009/04/03/stories/2009040350570300.htm|title=Where creativity thrives|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|author=Chakravarthy, Pradeep|date=3 April 2009|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962, it was renamed as the Government School of Arts and Crafts and the Government College of Arts and Crafts, before finally being renamed as present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/04/08/stories/2003040800160300.htm|title=Down memory lane|newspaper=The Hindu|date=8 April 2003|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
During British rule in India, the crown found that [[Madras]] had many talented and artistic minds.  As the British had also established a settlement in and around Madras, Georgetown was chosen to establish an institute that would cater to the artistic expectations of the royals in [[London]].  At first traditional artists were employed to produce furniture, metalwork, and curios, and their work was sent to the royal palaces of the Queen.  The institute established itself as the first school of art in India, predating the [[University of Madras]]. The school was located at Popham’s Broadway. In 1852, it was shifted to its present premises, a four-acre campus on Poonamallee High Road.&lt;ref name=h /&gt;

In 1928, Debi Prasad Roy Chowdhury joined as its vice-principal and in 1929, he became its first Indian principal. He was the principal until 1957. He was succeeded by [[K.C.S. Paniker]]. Later, a number of noted artists held the role of principal, including R. Krishna Rao, [[S. Dhanapal]], K.L. Munuswamy, A.P. Santhanaraj and [[C.J.Anthony Doss]].

In 1966, former principal [[K.C.S. Paniker]], along with his students and some artists associated with the college, founded the [[Cholamandal Artists' Village]], near [[Chennai]], vwhich is still considered one of the '10 biggest art moments' in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 biggest art moments |url= http://indiatoday.intoday.in/index.php?issueid=116&amp;id=22988&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;sectionid=25|date=19 December 2008  |publisher=[[India Today]] |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Hasht-Bihisht'''" ({{lang-fa|هشت بهشت}}, lit. "The Eight Paradises") is a famous poem written by [[Amir Khusrow]] around 1302 AD.  The poem is based on the ''[[Haft Paykar]]'' by [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], written around 1197 AD, which in turn takes its outline from the earlier epic [[Shahnameh]] written by [[Firdausi]] around 1010 AD. Like Nizami's ''Haft Paykar'', Khusro's ''Hasht Bihisht'' uses a legend about [[Bahram V]] Gur as its [[frame story]] and, in the style of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', introduces folktales told by seven princesses.  Most famously, Khusro appears to be the first writer to have added [[The Three Princes of Serendip]] as characters and the story of the alleged camel theft and recovery.

The eight "paradises" in the poem link closely with [[Jannah|the Islamic conception of Heaven]] with its eight gates and eight spaces, each one decorated with a special precious stone or material.&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hast-behest-2 |title=Encyclopaedia Iranica entry on Hast Behest |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the eight paradises are pavilions constructed for Bahram's "therapy" of storytelling. There is also a link to the [[Hasht-Bihisht (Architecture)|architectural]] and garden plan of eight paradises.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

==The narrative==
The narrative commences with the story of Bahram and Dilaram.

Later, Bahram has seven differently-coloured domed pavilions built for him within his palace grounds, in which wait seven princesses from various parts of the world. Bahram Gur visits each on a different day of the week and each of them tells him a story:

==Manuscripts==
The ''Hasht-Bihisht'', and indeed the whole of the ''Khamsah'', was a popular work in the centuries after Khusro's death, not only in India, but in Iran and the Ottoman Empire, and as such was illustrated nearly as frequently as Nizami's ''Khamsah'' from the early fifteenth century on.&lt;ref name=gabbay&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabbay|first=Alyssa|title=Islamic tolerance : Amir Khusraw and pluralism|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-415-77913-5|page=43|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
* The ''Hasht-Bihisht'' has never been translated entirely into any language except Italian. Verse translations of two stories (Tuesday and Friday) by Sunil Sharma have been published. 
* Lal and Prasada provide a partial direct-to-English translation and commentary of Saturday's tale which introduces [[The Three Princes of Serendip]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lal|first1=Oudh Behari|last2=Prasada|first2=Jwala|title=Complete Key to the Persian Entrance Course for 1897-1898 (for the University of Allahabad)|date=1896|publisher=Ram Chandra|location=Allahabad, India|language=English, Arabic, Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lebanon''''' is a mural size painting by [[Nabil Kanso]] depicting the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in a scene invoking the spirit and character of the people in the midst of horror and violence gripping the country.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil Kanso: ''The split of Life: Paintings 1974-1994'', pp.66-67, NEV Editions, Atlanta, Georgia, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Amid the scene of chaos and devastation, two central figures reach across toward each other symbolically to represent the appeal for unity in defiance of the forces of division, destruction, and terror.&lt;ref&gt;Bäckström, Lars: ''Nabil Kanso Libanon: Var Tids Guernica'', ''Kanso's Lebanon: Guernica of Our Time'', Ord &amp; Bild, pp. 42-45, Stockholm, Sweden,1986 [http://nabilkanso.org/backstrom.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lebanonpainting.com/lebanonpainting.html on line excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Painted in oil on linen and completed in 1983, the painting ''Lebanon'' measures 28 feet (8.5 meters) long by 10 feet (3meters) tall.&lt;ref&gt;The Split of Life, Lebanon, pp.66-67&lt;/ref&gt; Its composition delineates three sections. At the center, two leaping female figures reach toward each other, almost touching.&lt;ref&gt;Bäckström, Lars: ''Kanso's Lebanon: Guernica of Our Time'', pp.42-43&lt;/ref&gt; They are within grasp of a tiny pearl of white green light at the center of the canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Wehner, Rob: ''The Split of Life Paintings: 1974-1994'', The Bloomsbury Review, p. 6, July/August 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground plane forming the base of the two converging figures, an appealing mother carrying a child appears bursting out from a torched pyramidal structure serving to balance and heighten the overall impact of the central scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lebanonpainting.com/lebanonpainting.html Bäckström, p.42, on line excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

To the right side of the canvas stands a woman with her arms outstretched upward against an ascending perspective of a scene of devastation and destruction with scorched buildings and the gushing of human and animal suffering. They are presented as metaphors for the destruction besetting [[Lebanon]] and its capital city [[Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://lebanonpainting.com/lebanonpainting.html Our World: ''The Art of Nabil Kanso'', pp. 36-37, CA, 1984]&lt;/ref&gt; The right foreground is occupied by two lamenting women with hands over their heads and one covering the eyes of a child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lebanonpainting.com/lebanonpainting.html ''Lebanon: Nabil Kanso's Paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The left section of the painting draws focus on the figure of what appears like a [[Druze]] [[sheikh]] steering out from the picture plane with a desperate calling.&lt;ref&gt;Our World, ''The Art of Nabil Kanso'' p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; He is flanked on his left by a roaring horse and in front of him lies a fallen maiden wrapped with the [[Lebanese flag|flag of Lebanon]] behind protruding dark fists shaped like crawling tentacles. Above him, a wingspan bird covering a half-hid sun hovers over the contour of trees projecting flames that encircle infants floating around the arc of wide arms flung by a pleading figure underneath.&lt;ref&gt;Bäckström: ''Lebanon'', pp.42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background===

During the [[Lebanese Civil War]] which broke out in 1975 and raged for 15 years with unabated violence killing more than 100,000 with many more injured and destitute,&lt;ref&gt;O’Balance, Edgar: ''Civil War in Lebanon: 1975-92'', p. 10, MacMillan, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Kanso had made several trips to his native war-torn land.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Catherine, ''Artist Inspired by War-torn Homeland'', [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], pp. H1-2, July 8, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the period of the conflict, he executed a wide range of major paintings on the [[Lebanese Civil War|Lebanon war]] whose portrayal and theme evolved to universal expressions on human brutality and suffering. The paintings constitute a major part of [[The Split of Life]] interrelated series comprising works dealing with contemporary themes of war realized on large scale format. Among the works in the Split of Life are the series Vietnam (1974), Lebanon (1975–1990), One Minute: Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1978–79), South Africa (1979–80), America 500 Years (1989–91), Living Memory(1992–94).&lt;ref&gt;Kanso: ''The Split of Life Paintings 1974-1994'', pp. 121-130&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In subject matter and technique, Lebanon 1983 painting reflects Kanso's [[expressionism|expressionist]] figural style in the use of broad brush strokes with intense colors and symbols conveying his socio political ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Guevara, Luis Camilio: ''Between Horror and dominating Rupture'' Exhibition Catalog, pp. 4-5, Ateneo, Caracas, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nabilkanso.org/guevara.html Guevara, Luis Camilio, ''Nabil Kanso's Paintings'']&lt;/ref&gt; The character and composition of the painting reflect Kanso's elaborate rendering of large groups of figures as part of a continuum of victims of violence painted on large scale canvases depicting grim scenes with aggressive and apocalyptic imagery aimed at engaging the viewer and bringing attention to the horror and devastation of war.&lt;ref&gt;Erminy, Peran: ''The Apocalyptic Paintings of Nabil Kanso'', Exhibition Catalog, pp. 6-7, Caracas, Venezuela, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://apocalipsis.us/erminy.html Erminy, Peran, ''Nabil Kanso's Apocalypse'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The work makes reference to a number of 19th and 20th paintings rooted in [[expressionism|expressionist]], [[romanticism|romantic]], and [[symbolism (arts)|symbolist]] works such as those [[Goya]], [[Géricault]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Edvard Munch|Munch]], [[Picasso]], and [[José Clemente Orozco|Orozco]].

'''Romanesque art''' is the architecture of Europe which emerged in the late 10th century and evolved into the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style during the 12th century. The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] in England is more traditionally referred to as [[Norman architecture]].

The style can be identified across Europe with certain significant architectural features occurring everywhere. There are other characteristic which differ greatly from region to region.

Most of the buildings that are still standing are churches, some of which are very large abbey churches and cathedrals. The majority of these are still in use, some of them having been substantially altered over the centuries.&lt;ref name=BF&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This list presents a comparison of Romanesque churches, abbeys and cathedrals of different countries. The second section describes the architectural features that can be identified within pictures of major architectural elements.

==Romanesque architecture, regional characteristics==

=== Features of Romanesque architecture that is seen in different areas around Europe. ===

* '''Small churches''' are generally aiseless, with a projecting apse.
* '''Large churches''' are basilical with a nave flanked by aisles and divided by an arcade.&lt;ref name=BF303&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter VII, pp. 303-308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Abbey churches and cathedrals''' often had transepts.&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Round arches in arcades, windows, doors and vaults.&lt;ref name=BF308&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter VII, pp. 308-310}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Massive walls&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;

* Cushion capitals&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;
* Murals&lt;ref name=BF308/&gt;

===Features which are regionally diversified===

These features often have strong local and regional traditions. However, the movement of senior clergy, stonemasons and other craftsmen meant that these traditional features are sometimes found at distant locations.

* Ground plan&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Facade
* Position and number of towers&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Shape of towers&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Presence and shape of spires
* Shape of the east end&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Shape of columns&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Shape of piers&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Building material&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;

 File:Bari BW 2016-10-19 13-35-11 stitch.jpg|Front of Basilica di San Nicola, in [[Bari]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Influences===
* '''Pre-Romanesque''' is demonstrated in Italy by the construction of churches with thick walls of undressed stone, very small windows and massive fortresslike character.
* [[Early Christian architecture|Early Christian]] and [[Byzantine architecture|Italian Byzantine]] architecture formed a stylistic link with the architecture of [[Ancient Roman architecture|Ancient Rome]], through which the basilica plan and the Classical form of column were transmitted.&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* The architecture of Northern Italy has features in common with French and German Romanesque.&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* The architecture of Southern Italy and Sicily was influenced by both [[Norman architecture|Norman]] and [[Islamic architecture]].&lt;ref name=BF303/&gt;
* Building stone was available in mountainous regions, while brick was employed for most building in river valleys and plains. The availability of marble had a profound effect on the decoration of buildings.&lt;ref name=BF311&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter VIII, pp. 311-319}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The existence and continuance of local rather than unified rule meant the construction and continued existence of many Romanesque civic buildings, and a large number of cathedrals.
* A great many religious buildings of this period remain, many of them little altered. Other buildings include fortifications, castles, civic buildings, and innumerable domestic buildings that are often much altered.

* Portals were rarely large and were square rather than round, as at [[San Miniato al Monte]].  Decorative tympanums, where they exist, are mosaic, fresco or shallow relief, as at [[San Zeno, Verona]].&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* Shallow relief carving in marble was a feature of some facades, as at San Zeno and [[Modena Cathedral]]
* Ocular and [[Rose window|Wheel windows]] are commonly found in facades, as at San Zeno and Modena Cathedral.&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* Portals are sometimes covered by an open porch supported on two columns standing on the backs of lions at San Zeno, Verona.&lt;ref name=BF311/&gt;
* Internally, large churches generally have arcades resting on columns of Classical form.&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* There is little emphasis on vertical mouldings.&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* The wall surface above the arcade was covered with decorative marble, mosaic or fresco.&lt;ref name=BF320/&gt;  Galleries such as that at Pisa were uncommon, but occur in convent churches as nuns' galleries.
* Open timber roofs prevailed.&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* Ribbed vaults, when used, are large, square and domical, spanning two bays as at San Michele, Pavia, and [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]].
* The crossing is often covered by a dome, as at [[Bari Cathedral]] and Pisa Cathedral (where the dome is oval and of a later date).&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* The choir may be above a vaulted crypt, accessible from the nave or aisles, as at San Zeno, Verona.&lt;ref name=BF329/&gt;
* Freestanding polygonal baptisteries were common, as at [[Parma Cathedral]] and the [[Florence Baptistery|Baptistery of San Giovanni]], Florence.&lt;ref name=BF311/&gt;
* Cloisters often have an array of elaborately twisted columns, and fanciful decoration in mosaic tiles as at the Romanesque cloister of the Ancient Basilica of [[St Paul's Outside the Walls]], Rome.&lt;ref name=BF320/&gt;

* The foundation of the Cistercian Order in 1098 introduced a simplicity of design and austerity of ornament.&lt;ref name=BF335/&gt;
* Particularly in the south, the existence of Roman structures such as the [[Pont du Gard]]  played a part in the development of storied arcades and other structural forms.&lt;ref name=BF335/&gt;
* Building stone was readily available, including high grade limestone suitable for fine carving.&lt;ref name=BF335&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter IX, pp. 335-340}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For much of the period [[Normandy]] were comparatively large and powerful political unit, and developed consistent styles that affected much of northern France.&lt;ref name=BF335/&gt;
* South of the [[Loire Valley]] churches showed considerable diversity of architectural form and are often without aisles.&lt;ref name=BF335/&gt;
* The pilgrimage to [[Santiago de Compostela]] in northern Spain led to the establishment of [[Way of St. James|four pilgrim routes]] through France, and the establishment of many religious houses along the routes.
* Crusade and pilgrimage brought contact with [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and [[Byzantine architecture]] that influenced the forms of a number of churches such as [[Périgueux Cathedral|Saint-Front, Périgueux]].&lt;ref name=BF335/&gt;
* The development of ribbed vaulting at [[Saint-Etienne, Caen]], and the adoption of a number of new techniques within a single influential building, the [[Abbey of Saint-Denis]], led to the early employment of the Gothic methods of construction and style from 1140 onwards.&lt;ref name=BF340/&gt;
* A great many abbey churches, some of which are now cathedrals or have been elevated to the rank of [[Minor Basilica]], date from this period, and are among the finest architectural works of France.  There are also numerous village churches, many of which have remained little changed.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* Large churches of northern have basilical form of nave and aisles separated by arcades.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* Large churches of southern France may be without aisles, as at [[Angouleme Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* Churches generally have transepts.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* The eastern end often takes the form of an apse that is almost as high as the walls.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* The high apse was increasingly surrounded by an ambulatory and later Romanesque churches have a fully developed chevet with radiating chapels.
* In Normandy, two towers on the façade flanking the nave became standard for large churches and influenced the subsequent Romanesque and Gothic facades of Northern France, England, Sicily and other buildings across Europe.
*  At the Abbey Church of Cluny, as well as paired towers on the west front, there was a variety of towers large and small.  Of these the octagonal tower over the crossing and smaller transept tower remain intact.  This arrangement was to influence other churches such as the [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse]].
* Windows are increasingly of larger size and are often coupled, particularly in cloisters and towers.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* The façade takes two forms, that with two large towers, such as that at Saint-Etienne, Caen, and the screen form with two small flanking turrets, as at [[Angouleme Cathedral]]. 
* There are often three portals, as at the [[Abbey of la Trinité, Caen]], &lt;small&gt;left&lt;/small&gt;
* Façade decoration is rich and varied, with the central portal being the major feature.&lt;ref name=BF347&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter IX, pp. 347-352}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Large sculptured portals are a distinguishing feature of French Romanesque. The portal is deeply recessed and the jambs set with shafts and mouldings. They typically have lintels, supporting a tympanum carved in high relief.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* Interiors generally employed piers to support the arcades, rather than columns.  The form of the piers became increasing complex with shafts and mouldings leading into the mouldings of the arch, or the vault as at Saint-Etienne Nevers. &lt;small&gt;left&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* In the 12th century, cylindrical piers with [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] style capitals came into use.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* A pattern of three stages: vault, arcade and clerestory was established in the 11th century.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* Masonry vaults were preferred for larger churches, and were initially [[barrel vault|barrel]] or [[groin vault]]s, often with arches spanning the nave between the vaults.  Vaulted bays are square.&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* The earliest ribbed high vault in France is at Saint-Etienne, Caen (1120).  The wide adoption of this method led to the development of Gothic architecture.&lt;ref name=BF340/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;
* Several aiseless churches of [[Aquitaine]] and [[Anjou]] are roofed with domes, as at [[Angouleme Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF347/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Influences===
* The Pre-Romanesque tradition of architecture was Saxon. The thick-walled aiseless churches had archway leading into rectangular chancels. Bell towers often had an attached circular stair turret.  Windows were often arched or had triangular heads.&lt;ref name=BF386&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc= Chapter XII, pp. 386-397}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Norman invasion of 1066 unified the government of England.&lt;ref name=BF386/&gt;
*  Norman bishops were installed in English cathedrals and monasteries were established following Benedictine, Cluniac, Cistercian, and Augustinian rules.&lt;ref name=BF386/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF379/&gt;
* Monasteries were established in Wales, Scotland and Ireland, suppressing local Celtic monastic tradition.&lt;ref name=TOK&gt;{{harvnb|O'Keeffe|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many cathedrals were of monastic foundation serving a dual role, which affected their architecture, in particular the extended length of the choir and transepts.&lt;ref name=BF402&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 402}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There was a great diversity of building stone including limestone, New Red Sandstone, flint and granite.&lt;ref name=BF379&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, pp. 379-386}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In England, the relative political stability led to large diocese with few bishops. Cathedrals were correspondingly few in number and large in scale.
* Geographical isolation led to the development of distinct regional character.&lt;ref name=BF379/&gt;
* The climate led to the construction of long naves to facilitate processions in wet weather.&lt;ref name=BF379/&gt;
* Of the medieval cathedrals, nearly all were commenced in this period and several have remained substantially Norman structures.&lt;ref name=BF490&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 490}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many parish churches were commenced at this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cox |Ford|1961|pp= 47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The abbey churches suffered destruction at the time of the [[Dissolution of the monasteries]] in the early 16th century and the majority were reduced to ruins, some surviving as parish churches.&lt;ref name=BF379/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* It is characteristic of the medieval churches of the British Isles and England in particular that they were continually expanded, altered and rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clifton-Taylor|1986|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, although Norman buildings are numerous, few are intact, and at some, such as [[Lincoln Cathedral]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and [[Worcester Cathedral]], Norman architecture might be represented only by the portals, the columns of the nave or the crypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clifton-Taylor|1986|pp=29–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Norman facades of cathedrals and large abbeys follow the two basic forms found in France, that with paired towers as at [[Southwell Minster]] and that with framing turrets as at [[Rochester Cathedral]].
* Portals are usually arched and decorated with chevrons and other geometric ornament, barbaric faces and spirals.&lt;ref name=BF496/&gt;  There are a few carved Romanesque tympanums, with a [[Christ in Majesty]] at Rochester Cathedral. The ornamentation of portals in Ireland have distinctive elements of Celtic design as at the gabled portal of [[Clonfert Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=TOK/&gt;
* Side porches are common and are often the usually mode of entrance, the western portal only being opened for major festivals.&lt;ref name=BF379/&gt;
* Blind arcading is used as a major decorative feature, often around internal walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 506}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Windows are comparatively large and may be arranged in tiers as in the transepts of [[Peterborough Cathedral]].  Paired windows occur in towers.&lt;ref name=BF496&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 496}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Naves of cathedrals and abbey churches are of great length, and transepts are of strong projection.&lt;ref name=BF402/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF490/&gt;
* Chancels of cathedrals and abbey churches are also very long.&lt;ref name=BF402/&gt;
* The chancels of cathedrals and abbeys were round and with an ambulatory in the French manner, as indicated at Peterborough and [[Norwich Cathedral]]s but none have survived unchanged.&lt;ref name=BF490/&gt;
* Large central towers are characteristic, as at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]] and Norwich Cathedral.
* Many round towers occur in Ireland. They are also found in Saxon (Pre-Romanesque) architecture in England as stair towers attached to larger towers of square plan.
* The nave rises in three stages, arcade, gallery and clerestory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 493}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The arcade has two forms: arches resting on large cylindrical masonry columns as at [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]] and [[Hereford Cathedral]]s, and arches springing from composite piers as at Peterborough and [[Ely Cathedral]]s. [[Durham Cathedral]] has alternating piers and columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 505}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Crypts are groin vaulted, as at [[Canterbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=BF397/&gt;
* Nearly every large Norman church has a later, Gothic high vault, except at Peterborough and Ely Cathedrals which have retained trussed wooden ceilings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 501}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaults at Durham are of unique importance, that of the south aisle being the oldest ribbed vault in the world, and that of the nave being the earliest pointed ribbed vault in the world.&lt;ref name=BF397&gt;{{harvnb|Fletcher|1996|loc=Chapter XII, p. 397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ribbed vaults of the Norman period exist over the aisles at [[Peterborough Cathedral]] and other large churches.&lt;ref name=BF397/&gt;
*  Barrel vaults are rare, examples being St John's Chapel, [[Tower of London]]&lt;ref name=BF397/&gt; and several 12th century monastic churches in Ireland including [[Rock of Cashel#Buildings on the Rock|Cormac's Chapel]] and [[Killaloe Cathedral|St Flannan's oratory]].&lt;ref name=TOK/&gt;

===Influences===
* Prior to the beginning of the period, the greater part of the Iberian Peninsula was ruled by Muslims, with Christian rulers controlling only a strip at the north of the country.&lt;ref name=BF635&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp. 635-639&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= BK178/&gt;
* By 900 the [[Reconquista]] had increased the area under Christian rule to about one third of Iberia. This expanded to about half the area by 1150 and included Galicia, Leon, Castille, Navarre, Aragon, Catalonia and Portugal.&lt;ref name=BF635/&gt;
* Romanesque churches are located in the northern half of the peninsula, with a number occurring in [[Ávila, Spain|Avila]] which was re-established and fortified around 1100 and Toledo in central Spain from 1098.&lt;ref name= BK178&gt;Toman, ''Romanesque'', Bruno Klein, ''Romanesque architecture in Spain and Portugal, pp. 178-179&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many small Pre-Romanesque churches were established in the 10th century with distinctive local characteristics including vaults, horseshoe arches, and rose windows of pierced stone.&lt;ref name =BK178/&gt;
* Many Benedictine monasteries were established in Spain by Italian bishops and abbots, followed by the French orders of Cluniacs and Cistercians.
* In 1032, the church of [[Santa Maria de Ripoll]] was built to a complex plan with double aisles, inspired directly by [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]]. The church set a new standard for architecture in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Klein, pp. 180-181&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pilgrimage to [[Santiago de Compostela]] began as early as the 9th century, and by the 11th century was drawing pilgrims from England. The [[Way of Saint James]] (Camino de Santiago) was well established by the early 12th century and encouraged the foundation of monasteries along the route.&lt;ref name=BF635/&gt;
* Most of the area has abundant building stone, granite, limestone, Red Sandstone and volcanic rubble.&lt;ref name=BF635/&gt;
*There was little timber, so it was used sparingly for roofs.&lt;ref name=BF635/&gt;
* The northern part of the region is dotted with numerous small churches such as those of [[Andorra]] and the [[Vall de Boí]] in [[Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.andorra.ad/en-US/suggestions/Pages/art_romanic_andorra.aspx The Romanesque]'', Andorra, the official site, (accessed 13 Aug 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/988/ Catalan Romanesque Churches of the Vall de Boí]'', UNESCO World Heritage List&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also larger monasteries.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* It is characteristic of both cathedrals and large abbey churches that they have many accretions of different periods,  particularly flanking chapels, in later styles, often Baroque.
* Most churches are built of stone.  In areas where brick is used, [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[Sahagún]], [[Cuéllar]], the bricks are similar to Roman bricks. The exterior of brick churches, particularly the apses, are decorated with tiers of shallow blind arcading and square-topped niches, as at the churches of San Tirso and San Lorenzo, Sahagún
* Small churches abound across the area, usually having an aisless nave and projecting apse and a bell turret on one gable.
* Larger churches often have a wide turret extending across the upper facade with a gallery of openings holding bells, as at [[Jaca Cathedral]]
* Larger monastic churches often have a short transept and three eastern apses, the larger off the nave and a smaller flanking apse off each transept as at [[La Seu Vella, Lleida]].
* Lateral arcaded porches are a distinctive regional characteristic of small churches.&lt;ref name=Spain1/&gt;  Larger churches sometimes have a similar [[narthex]] at the west as at Santa Maria, Ripoll
* Portals are typically deep set, round topped and with many mouldings, as at [[La Seu Vella, Lleida]], Spain. Portals that are set within porches may be surrounded by rich figurative carvings as at the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]].
* Freestanding towers with increasing openings in each stage, like those of Italy, occur with small churches.
* Small churches are sometimes barrel vaulted and are roofed with stone slabs lying directly on the vault.
* Wider spaces have timber roofs of low profile, as timber was scarce.
* Larger churches such as the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela]], have barrel vaults, sometimes with transverse arches marking the bays.
* Abbey churches of later French foundation have ribbed vaults.
* Larger monastic churches and cathedrals have nave and aisles and follow French plans, including chevets as at Avila Cathedral.
* The crossing of a large church sometimes has an octagonal tower or dome supported on squinches, as at Santa Maria, Ripoll and the [[Cathedral of Santa Maria d'Urgell]] .
* At the [[Old Cathedral, Salamanca]] and the [[Cathedral of Zamora]] there are polygonal crossing domes on pendentives, with narrow windows and with four small corner turrets.
* Externally, many large churches are fortresslike, such as [[Lisbon Cathedral]] and the [[Old Cathedral of Coimbra]] in Portugal and the [[Sigüenza Cathedral]], Spain
* Rose windows with pierced tracery similar to those that occur in Pre-Romanesque churches of [[Oviedo]] are a feature in some facades, such as that at the Monastery of Santa María de Armenteira, Galicia.

===Influences===
* Much of Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands were united under [[Charlemagne]] who built a castle on the Valkhof, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, and the [[Palatine Chapel, Aachen|Palatine Chapel]] at Aachen.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;
* The power of individual bishops and the establishment of cathedrals and monasteries were focused initially in the south of Germany and the Rhineland.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;
* In the early 10th century Germany and Lombardy were united under Otto the Great, crowned in Charlemagne’s church at Aachen.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;
* Consolidation under Frederick Barbarossa in the 12th century led to the establishment of towns, imperial palaces and churches of imperial patronage.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;
* Despite internal divisions and threats from Poland, Hungary and Denmark, Germany regained power and in the early 13th century Frederick II became Holy Roman Emperor of Germany, Sicily, Lombardy, Burgundy and Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;
* Southern Germany, the Rhineland and Belgium had abundant building stone.&lt;ref name=BF570&gt;Banister Fletcher p. 570&lt;/ref&gt;
* Saxony and Flanders had little stone, while large parts of the Netherlands and the river plains of northern Germany had none, so that brick was the main building material.&lt;ref name=BF353/&gt;&lt;ref name=BF570/&gt;
* Timber was abundant in Germany and Belgium.&lt;ref name=BF570/&gt;
*The rich fertile river valleys, particularly those of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]], encouraged the growth of towns.&lt;ref name=BF353&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp 353-357&lt;/ref&gt;
* The period dating from the 9th to the 13th century produced Romanesque churches.&lt;ref name= BF357&gt;Banister Fletcher, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; Several important Early Romanesque churches occur in Saxony at Hildesheim and Gernrode. Many of the most notable examples of Romanesque architecture occur around the Rhineland, with twelve churches of this period in the city of Cologne.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* The most distinctive characteristic of large Romanesque churches is the prevalence of apses at both ends of the church, as on 9th-century [[Plan of St. Gall]], the earliest example being at Gernrode Abbey.  Two reasons are suggested: that the bishop presided at one end and the abbot at the other, or that the western apse served as a baptistery.&lt;ref name= BF357/&gt;
* The main portal of a double-apsed church is into the side of the building, and may be richly decorated with carving.&lt;ref name= BF357/&gt;
* Both apses are flanked by paired towers.  Many of the smaller towers are circular, as at [[Worms Cathedral]]. There may be numerous towers of varied shapes and sizes.&lt;ref name= BF363&gt;Banister Fletcher, pp. 363-364&lt;/ref&gt;
*The crossing is generally surmounted by an octagonal tower, as at [[Speyer Cathedral]].
* Spires are of roofed timber rather than stone and take a variety of forms, the most distinctive being the [[Rhenish helm]].&lt;ref name= BF363/&gt;  Stone is sometimes used for Rhenish helms as at the eastern end of the [[Basilica of Our Lady, Maastricht]].
* The towers and apse of the western end are often incorporated into a multi-storey [[Westwerk]]. These latter take a great variety of forms, from a flat façade as at [[Limburg Cathedral]], a flat façade with projecting apse at [[Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude, Nivelles|St Gertrude, Nivelles]] and a rectangular projecting structure of several storeys that juts beyond the towers as at [[Basilica of Saint Servatius|St Serviatius]], Maastricht.
*The transepts do not project strongly. 
* In the Rhineland, the exterior walls and towers are encircled with courses, [[Lombard bands]] and [[dwarf gallery]]s, which serve to emphasise the individual mass of each component part of the whole, as at [[Speyer Cathedral]].&lt;ref name= BF363/&gt;
* Wheel windows, ocular windows and windows with simple quatrefoil tracery often occur in apses, as at Worms Cathedral.
* Wooden roofs were common, with an ancient painted ceiling retained at [[St. Michael's Church, Hildesheim|St Michael’s, Hildesheim]].
* Stone vaults were used at a later date than in France, occurring over the aisles at Speyer in about 1060.&lt;ref name= BF357/&gt;

===Influences===
*Norway, Sweden and Denmark were separate kingdoms for much of the period.
*Much of Norway was united from the late 9th century until 1387 under [[Harold I of Norway|Harold I]] and his successors.
* [[Cnut the Great]] briefly united Denmark, England, Norway and parts of Sweden in the early 11th century.
*King [[Olaf II of Norway]], known as St Olav, did much to enforce Christianity on the Vikings, and by the end of the 11th Century, Christianity was the only legal religion.
* In Denmark, Christianity was promoted by [[Canute IV of Denmark|Canute the Holy]] in the late 11th century, with [[Sweyn II of Denmark]] dividing the country into eight dioceses, and establishing many churches, cathedrals and monasteries from about 1060 onwards.
* Much of Sweden was united under [[Olof Skötkonung|Olaf Eiríksson]] around 995, with the southern area, Götaland being united with Svealand by [[Sverker I of Sweden]] in the 1130s.
* [[Lund Cathedral]], Sweden, was made the seat of the archbishop for all of Scandinavia in 1103, but only the crypt remains from the 1130s, the rest being mostly 19th century rebuilding.&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;
* Bishop Absalon founded Roskilde Cathedral in Denmark in 1158 and the city of Copenhagen (1160–67).
* Architectural influences came with clergy brought from England (such as [[Nicholas Breakspeare]]), Lombardy and Germany.  The influence of English Norman architecture is seen particularly in Norway at [[Nidaros Cathedral]], Trondheim, and of German Romanesque at [[Lund Cathedral]], Sweden.&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;
* Benedictine monks from Italy introduced the skill of firing bricks to Denmark.
* While most churches were initially built of timber, the larger ones were replaced by stone, with brick being the dominant material in much of Denmark where building stone is scarce.
* Small Romanesque churches are plentiful and are generally in relatively unchanged condition. Large churches are rare and are much altered as at [[Aarhus Cathedral]], [[Lund Cathedral]] and [[Roskilde Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;
* Norway has 25 wooden stave churches from this period,&lt;ref name=HW/&gt; making up all but three of the world’s medieval wooden churches. 
* In Sweden, surviving Romanesque churches are concentrated mainly but not exclusively to three provinces: [[Gotland]], [[Scania]] and [[Västra Götaland]]

File:Husaby kyrka 20090523-01.jpg|At Husaby Church, Sweden, the massive tower is framed by round turrets.
File:EgliseBoisDeboutNorvege.jpg|Hopperstad Stave church, Norway (1130), one of twenty-five remaining from the Medieval period. 
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* The wooden [[stave church]]es of Norway represent a type that was once common across Northern Europe, but elsewhere have been destroyed or replaced.  They have timber frames, walls of planks, and shingled roofs which are steeply pitched and overhanging to protect the joints of the building from the weather.&lt;ref name=HW&gt;{{harvnb|Wischermann|1997a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Denmark has seven rotunda churches, which have a circular nave, divided into several storeys internally, and have projecting chancel and apse as at [[Bjernede Church]] and [[List of churches on Bornholm|Nylars Church]].&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;   At [[Østerlars Church]], the chancel and apse are constructed as small intersecting circles.  Rotunda churches also occur in Sweden as at [[Hagby]] Church.
* Bulky west towers with stepped gables are typical of Denmark and are found on smaller churches as at [[Horne Church]], [[Søborg, Gribskov Municipality|Søborg]] Church, and [[Aa Church]], Bornholm where the tower has paired crow-step gables at each side.
* In Denmark the west tower may extend across the whole width of the church, forming a westwerk as at [[Aa Church]] and Hvidbjerg Church, [[Mors (island)|Morsø]], with some such towers incorporating a large open archway with stairs such as at Torrild Church.
*Small stone churches in Norway and Sweden have a short wide nave, square chancel, an apse and a western tower with pyramidal shingled spire, as at Hove Church, Norway and Kinneveds Church and [[Helena of Skövde|Våmbs Church]], Sweden.
* Large central towers occur in Norway, as at [[Old Aker Church]].
* Free standing belltowers are found, often with half-timbered upper sections.
* Stone churches, such as Aa Church, Denmark and [[Lund Cathedral]], Sweden, have Lombard bands and paired windows, similar to churches of Lombardy and Germany.
* Openings are generally small and simple.  Many doors have a carved tympanum as at [[Vestervig Church]] and [[Ribe Cathedral]], Denmark
* Most churches have timber roofed naves, but ribbed vaulting over smaller spaces such as the chancel is common.  Some small churches, such as [[Falköping|Marka Church]] in Sweden, have groin vaults.  Larger churches such as [[Ribe Cathedral]] are vaulted.
* Arcades may be of simple rectangular piers such as at Ribe, Denmark, or drum columns such as at [[Stavanger Cathedral]], Norway. [[Lund Cathedral]] has alternating rectangular piers and piers with attached shafts which support the vault.
* Fully developed Romanesque arcades of three stages occur in churches built under English or German influence as at [[Nidaros Cathedral]], Trondheim.&lt;ref name=HW/&gt;
* Large churches may have paired towers at the western end, as at [[St Mary's Church, Bergen|Mariakirken]], Bergen.
* [[Visby Cathedral]] and [[Husaby Church]], Sweden, have tall westwerks, framed by round towers. At [[Ribe Cathedral]] the stone westwerk is framed on the south by a Romanesque tower of German form with a Rhenish helm spire and on the north by a taller Gothic tower in red brick.

===Influences===
* The remaining buildings are few in number and the influences are diverse.&lt;ref name=HWI&gt;{{harvnb|Wischermann|1997b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*  Poland became Christian under [[Mieszko I]] in 966, resulting in the foundation of the first [[Pre-Romanesque]] churches, including [[Wawel Cathedral]] in Kraków, [[Gniezno Cathedral|Gniezno]] and [[Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, Poznań|Poznań]] Cathedrals.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
* During the period 976–1248 Austria was ruled by margraves of the [[House of Babenberg]]. Towns and monasteries were established.
* The Romanesque style was introduced to Poland from Germany with the founding of the bishopric of Gniezno in 1000.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
* In Hungary, [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]] brought the Magyar states together in 1001 and created two Catholic archbishoprics.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
* [[Bohemia]] was largely Christianised in the 10th century under Vaclav I.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
* The bishopric of Prague was established in 973 with a Saxon Benedictine bishop, Thietmar.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
* The Benedictine, Premonstratensian and Augustinian orders founded monasteries and built abbey churches throughout the area.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
* The influence on architectural style was initially from Germany, and later from France and Italy.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;

File: Kraków, St. Andrew.JPG| At [[St. Andrew's Church, Kraków]], the plain westwerk resolves into octagonal towers.
File:Gurk Cathedral.jpg| [[Gurk Cathedral]], Austria,  has remarkably little adornment of the westwerk, and arbitrary placement of the lower windows
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Characteristics===
* There are a number of surviving small rotunda churches, generally with an apse as at Öskü, Hungary and [[Culture of medieval Poland|Saint Nicholas Rotunda]] in Cieszyn, Poland.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
*  Rotunda churches sometimes have towers which may be circular as at [[Culture of medieval Poland|Saint Procopius Church]], Strzelno, Poland or square in plan as at the [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Budeč]], Czech Republic.
* Other small churches found in the region are rectangular, aisleless and with a square chancel,&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt; or an apse as at the [[Hrusice#Sights|Church of Saint Wenceslas, Hrusice]], Czech Republic. [[Schöngrabern]] Church, Austria, has a square chancel and projecting apse.
* Larger churches have a nave and aisles, each ending in an apse, and with no transept.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;  Examples are [[Pécs|Pécs Cathedral]], [[Ják#Ják Church|Ják Church]] and the Basilica of the Assumption, [[Tismice]], Czech Republic.
* The aisles sometimes contained galleries for the nobility.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt;
* While arcades are usually supported on piers, the Basilica of the Assumption, [[Tismice]] has alternating piers and columns which have [[cushion capital]]s.
* Larger churches have paired western towers, some with decorated central portals, as at [[Ják#Ják Church|Ják Church]] and the ruined [[Zsámbék Premontre monastery church|Zsambek Church]], Hungary.
* At [[St. Andrew's Church, Kraków]], the unornamented facade takes the form of westwerk, with an octagonal towers rising on either side. [[Gurk Cathedral]], Austria,  has a similarly flat facade, rising to two very tall square towers.
* The [[Collegiate church in Tum|Collegiate Church at Tum]] has and apse at either end, similar to many German Romanesque churches.&lt;ref name=HWI/&gt; The western apse is flanked by square towers.
* Pecs Cathedral, Hungary, has four towers of square plan, like [[Bamberg Cathedral]], Germany.
* Tower openings take the typical Romanesque paired form as at [[Church of St Peter and St Paul, Budeč]] Czech Republic.
* Roofs are generally of wood, with vaults occurring
* Lombard bands are used, as at [[Schöngrabern]] Church, Austria, and around the towers of Tum and Ják churches.
* The facade of [[Sulejów Abbey]] Church, founded by the [[Cistercians]], and having a gabled portal and rose window, heralds the influence of French architectural style that was to introduce Gothic.

The fact that the Christ Candle in the centre of the [[Advent wreath]] is lit also indicates that [[Christmas]] has arrived.]]
'''Liturgical colours''' are those specific colours used for [[vestment]]s and [[Antependium|hangings]] within the context of [[Christianity|Christian]] [[liturgy]]. The symbolism of [[violet (color)|violet]], white, green, red, gold, black, [[Rose (color)|rose]] and other colours may serve to underline moods appropriate to a season of the [[liturgical year]] or may highlight a special occasion.

There is a distinction between the colour of the vestments worn by the clergy and their [[choir dress]], which with a few exceptions does not change with the liturgical seasons.

==Roman Catholic Church==

===Current rubrics===
In the [[Roman Rite]], as reformed by [[Pope Paul VI]], the following colours are used.&lt;ref name=IGMR&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/cdwlgrm.htm ''Institutio Generalis Missalis Romani''], no. 346; cf.

On more solemn days, i.e. festive, more precious, sacred vestments may be used, even if not of the colour of the day. Such vestments may, for instance, be made from [[cloth of gold]] or [[cloth of silver]]. Moreover, the Conference of Bishops may determine and propose to the Apostolic See adaptations suited to the needs and culture of peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 346.g&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual Masses are celebrated in their proper colour, in white, or in a festive colour. Masses for Various Needs, on the other hand, are celebrated in the colour proper to the day or the season or in violet if they bear a penitential character. Votive Masses are celebrated in the colour suited to the Mass itself or even in the colour proper to the day or the season.&lt;ref&gt;[[GIRM]], 347&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Regional and situational exceptions ====
Some particular variations:
*{{Color sample|#6495ed}} '''[[Marian blue|Blue]]''', a colour associated with the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], is permitted for the feast of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in [[Spain]] and in some dioceses in [[Portugal]], [[Mexico]], and [[South America]]. In the [[Philippines]], it is authorised for all feasts of the Virgin Mary, a practice followed in some other places without official warrant. There have also been uses of blue in place of violet for the season of Advent despite the fact that this practice is not authorized under liturgical law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canticanova.com/articles/xmas/art1c1.htm Cantica Nova Publications], ''Advent Blues'', editorial by Gary D. Penkala, December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{Color sample|white}} '''White''' or {{Color sample|#d4af37}} '''[[cloth of gold]]''' was traditionally used for [[Misa de Gallo|the Novena]] from 16 to 24 December according to a Spanish custom abolished in that country in the 1950s, but still widely observed in the [[Philippines]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}. White is also used for East Asian Masses for the dead, as white is the traditional colour of mourning in many of the region's cultures. Furthermore, if not enough vestments of the proper colour are available (particularly in [[concelebration]]s), white may be used for all concelebrants.

===Pre-1969 rubrics===
The [[Roman Missal]], as revised by [[Pope John XXIII]] in 1962, was authorised for use as an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] by the 2007 ''[[motu proprio]]'' entitled ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''. Pope John XXIII's revision of the Missal incorporated changes that he had made with his ''motu proprio'' ''Rubricarum instructum'' of 29 July 1960;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/books-1962/missale-romanum-1962-pdf.html ''Missale Romanum'' 1962 in PDF Format]&lt;/ref&gt; these changes went into effect on January 1, 1961. The following are the differences between its rules for liturgical colours and the later rules:

[[Pope Pius X]] raised the rank of Sundays of ordinary time, so that on those that fell within octaves '''green''' was used instead of the colour of the octave, as had previously been the rule.&lt;ref&gt;''Rubricae generales Missalis: XVIII – De Coloribus Paramentorum'' in the [http://www.sanctamissa.org/EN/resources/missale-romanum-pdf.html 1920 typical edition] of the Roman Missal omitted the phrase "exceptis Dominicis infra octavas occurrentibus, in quibus color octavarum servatur" found in earlier editions beginning with Pope Pius V's edition of 1570 (page 21 of the facsimile published by Libreria Editrice Vaticana in 1998 – {{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules on liturgical colours before the time of Pope Pius X were essentially those indicated in the edition of the Roman Missal that [[Pope Pius V]] promulgated in 1570, except for the addition of feasts not included in his Missal. The scheme of colours in his Missal reflected usage that had become fixed in Rome by the twelfth century.

==Byzantine Rite==
The [[Byzantine Rite]], which is used by all the member churches of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Byzantine Rite Lutheranism|Byzantine Lutheran Churches]] and the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] of Byzantine Rite, does not have a universal system of colours, with the service-books of the Byzantine tradition only specifying "light" or "dark" vestments in the service books. In the Greek tradition, [[Maroon (colour)|maroon]] or [[Burgundy (color)|burgundy]] are common for solemn feast days, and a wide variety of colours are used at other times, the most common of which are gold and white.

Slavic-use churches and others influenced by Western traditions have adopted a cycle of liturgical colours.  The particulars may change from place to place, but generally:

||
*Funerals (Throughout the year, even during Holy Week.)
|}

The colours would be changed before [[Vespers]] on the eve of the day being commemorated.  During Great Feasts, the colour is changed before the vespers service that begins the first day of a [[forefeast]], and remains until the apodosis (final day of the [[afterfeast]]).

Under Western influence, black is often used in the Slavic churches for funerals, weekdays of Great Lent, and Holy Week as a sign of [[penance]] and mourning, but in the second half of the 20th century, the ancient white became more common, as a sign of the hope of the Resurrection.

==Russian liturgical colours==

According to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]'s ''Nastol'naya Kniga Sviashchenno-sluzhitelia'',&lt;ref&gt;Nastol'naya Kniga Sviashchenno-sluzhitelia, Volume 4, Moscow,1983, Translated in "The Messenger" of St. Andrew's Russian Orthodox Cathedral,Philadelphia, June, July–August, September, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; up to eight different liturgical colours may be used throughout the year.  Exact usage of these colours varies, but the following are the most common uses.

==Coptic Rite==
The [[Copts|Coptic]] tradition, followed by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] and the [[Coptic Catholic Church]], only uses white vestments, with gold and silver being considered variations of white. The only exception is during [[Passion Week]] when black is used. Nonetheless, trimmings of red, gold or blue may be found on some vestments.

==Ethiopian Rite==
The liturgical tradition of Ethiopia, followed by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Ethiopian Catholic Church]], embraces a wide variety of liturgical colours. In [[Eritrea]], similar traditions are followed.

==Lutheran churches==
The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA), uses the same colour scheme as that of the Anglicans and their Scandinavian Lutheran counterparts, but with the use of gold only for the Easter Vigil and Easter Sunday services, with Holy Week using scarlet in place of crimson.

Both the [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod]] (LCMS) and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] (WELS) use a similar system, but with purple being the primary colour for both Advent and Lent (with blue being the alternate colour for Advent only), and the use of gold in place of white for both Christmas and Easter (in similar practice to the Catholic Church).  In the WELS, the use of red is also done during the ''Period of End Times'', a period of the Church regarding the teachings of the Book of Revelation, culminating in the creation of the New Jerusalem (corresponding to Christ the King in the ELCA). In all three churches, including the ELCA, red is also worn on the last Sunday of October, in celebration of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] on October 31, when [[Martin Luther]] nailed the [[95 Theses]] onto the door of Wittenberg Castle Church.

==Anglicanism==
[[Image:Lenten Array Edgbaston.jpg|thumb|right|Lenten Array altar frontal by [[George Pace]] at [[St Augustine's Church, Edgbaston|St Augustine's, Edgbaston]]]]
Most [[Anglican]] churches use the colours appointed in the Roman Rite, usually in its post-1969 form, with the exception of Sarum Blue replacing violet for Advent, but some use the earlier form, with, for instance, black in place of red on [[Good Friday]]. Some churches use black at Masses for the dead, but more commonly white or purple is used. For historical reasons much of the worldwide Anglican Communion takes a noticeable lead from the practice of the [[Church of England]]. Since the 1980 [[Alternative Service Book]], liturgical colours have been recommended for seasons, with more detailed advice offered as part of the [[Common Worship]] series of liturgies, including colours for all Sundays and festivals printed in the 'core volume' next to collects.

The Church's published Lectionary now makes detailed suggestions for liturgical colour throughout the year, which corresponds almost exactly with the above table of Roman Rite (post-1969 usage) usage with five minor exceptions, and one more significant one:

:* there is no reference in Anglican usage to Masses of deceased popes and cardinals;
:* no liturgical colour at all is suggested for [[Holy Saturday]] (the words "hangings removed" are printed);
:* the recommendation of red for confirmation rites is extended also to ordination rites;
:* Lenten Array (unbleached linen) continues to be listed as an alternative option to purple during Lent;
:* the option exists for using red instead of green during the "Kingdom Season", the four last Sundays of the liturgical year, culminating in [[Christ the King]], as is common is some Lutheran traditions (see below);
:* finally, and more significantly, the Church of England provision suggests white throughout the Sundays after [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] as a distinct "Epiphany season", with ordinary time commencing the day after [[Candlemas]].

The colour scheme suggested by the [[Church of England]] also indicates where gold vestments should be used in those churches that possess gold and white as distinct colours. The use of rose-pink vestments, as in the Roman Rite table above, was mentioned as an option in early editions of Common Worship,&lt;ref&gt;The use of rose-pink vestments is suggested in the liturgical colour sequence notes of [[Common Worship]] of which an [http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/commonworship/texts/rules/rulesyear.html on-line version may be found here].&lt;/ref&gt; and is a listed option in the annual published lectionary; however, later Common Worship publications have begun to refer to this practice as "traditional" reflecting its resurgence.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see "Common Worship - Times &amp; Seasons", added to the Common Worship series in 2006, page 50, paragraph 1: "rose-pink vestments are traditionally worn".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarum Rite===
The [[Sarum Rite]] was a medieval liturgical rite used in [[England]] before the [[Reformation]] which had a distinct set of liturgical colours. After the [[Anglo-Catholic]] Revival of the 19th century, certain [[Church of England]] churches began adopting Sarum liturgical colours as an attempt to produce something that was an English expression of [[Catholicism]] rather than a Roman expression. One of the chief advocates behind this was [[Percy Dearmer]]. The exact colours used by the mediaeval Sarum rite are a matter of dispute, but colours adopted by contemporary churches claiming to use the Sarum scheme include in particular deep blue for [[Advent]], which may be popularly referred to as "Sarum blue", and unbleached linen for [[Lent]]. The Sarum rite has never received official approval in the [[Church of England]] or in [[The Episcopal Church]], but has influenced a number of cathedrals and parish churches.

==Methodist churches==
[[Methodism|Methodists]] use a colour scheme similar to those used by Lutherans and Catholics, although the practice is not universally followed. [[The United Methodist Church]], prior to the early-1990s, used red solely for Pentecost, even including the Sundays after Pentecost Sunday, with the use of green being reserved for the season of [[Kingdomtide]], which usually lasted from late August/early September until Christ the King (the last Sunday in Kingdomtide). Since the publication of the [[The United Methodist Book of Worship (1992)|1992 Book of Worship]], the UMC has followed the ELCA practice of wearing red only for Pentecost and [[Reformation Sunday]] and green for the rest of the Pentecost season.

==Reformed churches==
The [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] has sanctioned the use of liturgical colours and promoted their use in the 1993 Book of Common Worship (although their use was also promoted in the church's annual Planning Calendars beginning in the 1980s). Advent and Lent are periods of preparation and repentance and are represented by the colour purple. The feasts of Christmas Day and Christmastide, Epiphany Sunday, Baptism of the Lord Sunday, Transfiguration Sunday, Easter Season, Trinity Sunday, and Christ the King Sunday are represented by white. Green is the colour for periods of Ordinary Time. Red is for Pentecost Sunday, but may also be used for ordinations, church anniversaries, and memorial services for ordained clergy. Red or purple are appropriate for Palm Sunday. During Holy Week, the church may use purple or remain bare (although a few churches will use black for Good Friday).

Similarly, the [[United Church of Christ]] includes indications of which liturgical colour to use for each Sunday in its annual calendar. The general Western pattern is followed, with either purple or blue recommended for Advent.&lt;ref&gt;''United Church of Christ Desk Calendar and Plan Book 2016,'' http://www.uccresources.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">'''Liturgical [[dance]]''' is a type of dance movement sometimes incorporated into liturgies or worship services as an expression of [[worship]].

Some liturgical dance had been common in ancient times or non-western settings, with precedents in the Hebrew religion back to accounts of dancing in the [[Old Testament]]. An example is the episode when [[David|King David]] danced before the [[Ark of the Covenant]] ([http://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=david+danced&amp;qs_version=DRA 2 Sam 6:14]), but this dancing is often cited outside of [[Jewish]] norms and Rabbinic rituals prescribed at the time.

The '''''Madonna and Child with St Jerome''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Pinturicchio]], painted around 1481 and housed in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] of [[Berlin, Germany]].

==Description==
The painting shows an infrequent composition, with the Virgin holding the Child who writes on a book, an allusion to his intervention in the Holy Books. On the right is [[St. Jerome]], recognizable by his cardinal dress, leaving a book on the marble throne where the Madonna sits: in this case this is one of his traditional attributes of knowledge.

Jesus wears a pearl-lined [[coif]] which can be seen in another Pinturicchio's work of the period, the ''[[Crucifixion between Sts. Jerome and Christoper]]'' (c. 1475), now at the [[Borghese Gallery]]. The theme, used also by [[Fiorenzo di Lorenzo]], was later abandoned by the Umbrian artist in favour of a free, curly hair.

On the right is an open landscape, a typical element of the Renaissance Umbrian school.

This was published in the period 1686-1709 and depicted 420 plants from the ''Hortus Medicus'' of Amsterdam.  She was born in [[The Hague]] and died in [[Amsterdam]].

==''Hortus Medicus''==
In 1682 [[Joan Huydecoper II]] and [[Jan Commelin]] took the initiative in establishing a new ''Hortus Medicus'' in Amsterdam. It differed from the herb garden at the Binnengasthuis insofar as it also grew ornamental plants and would function as a ''Hortus Botanicus''. Huydecoper was mayor of Amsterdam and had great influence with the [[Dutch East India Company]], while Commelin was a merchant in herbs and pharmaceuticals. Both men were well known as enthusiastic and knowledgeable gardeners. Because of their contacts in the business world and their practical horticultural experience,  they received a constant stream of plants, seeds, bulbs and cuttings to be cultivated far from their original habitat.

This led to the creation of one of the richest plant collections in Europe. Plants of commercial value, also potherbs, edible crop plants and medicinal plants, were propagated in the garden for planting elsewhere. An example of this was the [[coffee]] plant, which oddly, was not illustrated in the ''Moninckx Atlas'', but became the backbone of the Brazilian coffee industry. In addition many ornamental plants, especially strange and exotic plants, were cultivated. These plants were grown for pure interest, curiosity value and often for further research.

==Moninckx Atlas==
Between 1686 and 1709, Huydecoper and Commelin commissioned 420 large parchment [[aquarel]]s of plants growing in the Amsterdam garden. The garden did not have a [[herbarium]], and a pictorial record in the form of paintings, would create something of permanent value.

Four very accomplished artists were employed to tackle this extensive project. The lion's share of work was done by Jan Moninckx: 273 sheets bear his signature. Maria Moninckx, his daughter, produced 101 paintings. The other artists were [[Alida Withoos]] (13 aquarels) and [[Johanna Helena Herolt-Graff]] (daughter of [[Maria Sibylla Merian]]) with 2 sheets; 31 aquarels were unsigned. The heraldic arms of Huydecoper and Commelin, painted by Jan Moninckx, were used to decorate volume 1 of the Atlas. In 1749 there was an attempt to expand the collection. This 9th volume consisted of a mere five aquarels, one by Dorothea Storm-Kreps and four by Jan Matthias Cock. The illustrated plants in the first five volumes and part of the sixth, had their names printed in both Latin and Dutch. The Latin names in bold Roman type, and the Dutch names in elegant Gothic calligraphy.

This monumental work is still of great taxonomic, historic, and artistic interest. The aquarels have served as the basis for engravings in the ''Horti Medici Amstelodamensis rariorum plantarum historia'', part 1, by Jan Commelin, appearing in 1697 and part 2, by his cousin Caspar Commelin, in 1701. The famed botanist [[Carl Linnaeus]] based the taxonomy for his ''Species plantarum'' of 1753 on no fewer than 259 species from the ''Moninckx Atlas''. A recent scanning of the complete work has made the plates and text available on the [http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/i/image/image-idx?c=botanie;page=index;sid=d44a711aecd3e8dca7c341e56be383e1;tpl=p_moninckx.tpl;corig=botanie;start=1 University of Amsterdam] website.

==Moninckx family==
The Moninckx family had a long tradition of being painters and were researched in a book titled ''De Schildersfamilie Moninckx'', published by [[:nl:Abraham Bredius|Abraham Bredius]] in 1889. Well-known was Gijsbert Moninckx, a member of the Guild of St Lucas in [[The Hague]] in 1605. Bredius' book confuses Maria Moninckx with Machteld Moninckx, the widow of Paulus Dinant.

Maria's father was [[Jan Moninckx]], her collaborator on the ''Moninckx Atlas'', and her mother was Ariaentje Pieters.
On 18 April 1723 Maria signed a betrothal register in Amsterdam, avowing her intention to marry Martinus de la Ruel. Maria's age was given as 47 years and her place of residence as The Hague, while Martinus was 46 years old and from Amsterdam. Maria's signature in the betrothal register corresponds with her signature on the aquarels of the ''Moninckx Atlas''.

Some of his work appeared under the [[pen name]] "Mart Dellon."

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], Nodell was the son of Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story| title=Superhero summer: Behind 'Green Lantern' and the rest, an American story|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623172041/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story|archivedate=June 23, 2011|deadurl=no|first=Gloria|last= Goodale|date= June 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2011|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | page= [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story/(page)/2 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[https://www.lambiek.net/artists/n/nodell_martin.htm Martin Nodell] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]. This source says Nodell also attended the "Chicago Academy of Art", but no school of that name exists, and the [[Chicago Academy for the Arts]] was not founded until 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] in the 1930s, where he attended [[Pratt Institute]].&lt;ref name=lam /&gt;

===National Comics Publications===
Nodell began his illustrating career in 1938, working first as a freelancer. In 1940 he provided some work for [[Sheldon Mayer]], an editor at [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that ultimately merged to form [[National Comics Publications]] (present-day [[DC Comics]]). Interested in gaining more steady employment, Nodell created designs for a new character that would become the Golden Age [[Green Lantern]] ([[Alan Scott]]). The inspiration came in January 1940 at the 34th Street [[Subway (rail)|subway]] station in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB6 /&gt; Nodell noticed a trainman waving a lantern along the darkened tracks. He coupled the imagery with elements from [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[opera]]tic [[Ring cycle]]&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; as well as [[Chinese folklore]] and [[Greek mythology]]&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB6 /&gt; to create the hero.&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dionisio |first=Joseph |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zBx0HteF?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070205153908/http://www.newsday.com/news/obituaries/ny-lidnode115011627dec11,0,3651663.story |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |title=Green Lantern Creator Martin Nodell, 91 |work=[[Newsday]] |date=December 11, 2006 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/obituaries/ny-lidnode115011627dec11%2C0%2C3651663.story |deadurl=yes |df= }} Additional, June 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Nodell himself described in 2000:
{{quote|I picked out the name from the train man on the tracks who was waving a lantern, going from red to green.... Green meant go and I decided that was it. Then I needed a colorful and interesting costume. I was interested in Greek mythology and so the costume took on elements of that. It just all fell into place. When I sent it in, I waited into the second week before I heard the word to come in. I was ushered into [[Max Gaines|Mr. [Max] Gaines]] office, publisher, and after sitting a long time and flipping through the pages of my presentation, he announced, 'We like it!' And then, 'Get to work!' I did the first five pages of an eight page story, and then they called in Bill Finger to help. We worked on it for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Nodell in {{cite web| last=Black| first= Bill| url= http://www.accomics.com/accomics/goldenage/nuggets_nodell.html |title=An Interview with Green Lantern Creator Martin Nodell| publisher= AC Comics|year= 2000| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5zBwS4Oy9?url=http://www.accomics.com/accomics/goldenage/nuggets_nodell.html |archivedate= June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first adventure, drawn by Nodell (as Mart Dellon) and written by [[Bill Finger]], appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #16 (July 1940). Nodell continued to use the pseudonym through at least ''[[All Star Comics]]''&lt;!--sp OK with no hyphen--&gt; #2 (Fall 1940).&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/martin%20nodell/sort/chrono/ Martin Nodell] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; He said in 2000 he had used the pen name since, "Comics were a forbidden literature, culturally unacceptable. It wasn't something you were proud of". Nodell penciled and virtually always self-inked Green Lantern stories in ''All-American'' and ''All Star'' until the character got his own title, the premiere issue cover-dated July 1941. He would continue with it through to #25 (May 1947), very rarely drawing the covers, before being succeeded by a variety of artists including [[Howard Purcell]], [[Irwin Hasen]], and [[Alex Toth]].

===Timely Comics===
[[Image:MarvelTales93.jpg|left|thumb|''Marvel Tales'' #93 (Aug. 1949). Cover art by Nodell.&lt;!--per [http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=7756 this page] at the Grand Comics Database--&gt;]]
Nodell left All-American in 1947 and joined [[Timely Comics]], the 1930s–40s forerunner of [[Marvel Comics]]), where he drew postwar stories of [[Captain America]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Sub-Mariner]]. His work there was rarely signed, making idenfication difficult, though comics historians have confirmed that Nodell drew two well-known covers: The first issue of ''[[Marvel Tales]]'', Timely's [[horror fiction|horror]]-comics revamp of the company's flagship series ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]''; and the penultimate issue (#74) of Captain America's book, which for its last two issues became the horror-oriented ''Captain America's Weird Tales''.

===Post-1950s career===
In 1950, Nodell left comics to work in advertising and later joined the [[Leo Burnett Agency]] in Chicago as an [[art director]]. In 1965, his design team there developed the long-running [[flour]]-company mascot the [[Pillsbury Doughboy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionisio, 2000.

His only known comics work in the interim are penciling the story "The Glistening Death" in the [[Avon Comics]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''City of the Living Dead'' (1952), reprinted two decades later in the [[Skywald]] horror-comics magazine ''Psycho'' #1 (Jan. 1971); and "Master of the Dead" in Avon's ''Eerie'' (1951 series) #14, reprinted in Skywald's ''Nightmare'' #1 (Dec. 1970).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

In the 1980s, Nodell submitted new work to DC, which led to his being rediscovered by comic fans. His first pieces included a 13-page puzzle-and-activity section in ''[[Super Friends|Super Friends Special]]'' #1 (1981), and drawing the Golden Age [[Harlequin (comics)#Molly Mayne|Harlequin]] in ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe|Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe]]'' #10 (Dec. 1985).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; His final two published pieces of Green Lantern art were a one-page illustration of Golden Age [[Alan Scott]] Green Lantern in the 50th-anniversary issue ''Green Lantern'' vol. 3, #19 (Dec. 1991)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/50454/ ''Green Lantern'' DC, 1990 Series) #19] at Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; and a one-page illustration of the Alan Scott Green Lantern and [[Superman]] in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery'' #1 (Dec. 1995).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/58075/ ''Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery'' #1] at the Grand Comics Database. Note: The [http://www.comics.org/issue/91581/ GCD also lists] Nodell among three [[pencilers]] who contributed to the single [[Hal Jordan]] Green Lantern figure on the cover of the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Green Lantern Gallery'' #1 (1996), but this cover is signed only by penciler [[Gil Kane]] and [[inker]] [[Kevin Nowlan]].&lt;/ref&gt; At 80, Nodell penciled his final comic-book work, the whimsical, 10-page [[Harlan Ellison]] adaptation "Gnomebody", scripted by [[John Ostrander]] and Ellison and inked by [[Jed Hotchkiss]], in [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor Quarterly'' #1 (Aug. 1996).

===Personal life===
Nodell met his future wife, Carrie, at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in September 1940.&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB9&gt;Dionisio, 2000.

==Early life==
Marcus was born in New York in 1954.&lt;ref name="chadwick1"/&gt; He developed [[Dystonia|generalised dystonia]] when he was eight years old.&lt;ref name="berkeleydailyplanet1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berkeleydailyplanet.com/issue/2011-11-23/article/38905?headline=Neil-Marcus-Fantastic-Spastic--By-Dorothy-Snodgrass |title=Neil Marcus: Fantastic Spastic. Category: Arts &amp; Events from |publisher=The Berkeley Daily Planet |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Carrie Sandhal's entry in the ''Encyclopedia of American Disability History'', "Marcus was born on January 3, 1954, in White Plains, New York, but spent his childhood in Ojai, California. He is the youngest of five children born to a secular Jewish family. Marcus's family life was full of art; his mother was a musician and his father a filmmaker. His family regularly hosted visiting artists. Marcus was an active child who loved the outdoors and physical activity, qualities that would continue even after the age of eight, when his dystonia manifested itself. His onset of dystonia was painful and disorienting, as diagnosis was elusive and a cure impossible. Marcus struggled with depression throughout his adolescence and began writing in his journal, chronicling his frustrations and joys as a disabled person. He credits his experiences in co-counseling, which he began at age 14, with pulling him out of his depression and spawning his performance aesthetic. Co-counseling involves peer-to-peer, confidential counseling that helps the participants discover themselves and deal with their emotions. Marcus has discussed his relationship with audiences as a form of co-counseling in which he and they share experiences on a journey of discovering self and other." &lt;ref&gt;Sandahl, Carrie. "Marcus, Neil (1954-) Artist and Performer." Encyclopedia of American Disability History. Ed. Susan Burch. New York: Facts on File, 2009. 592-593. Facts on File Library of American History. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 14 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
His early career began when Marcus left for college in Washington State, he began to write. Later moving to Berkeley to continue his studies, he became active in the Disability Rights Movement.&lt;ref name=humanbeing&gt;Human Being. Vol. 1. Chicago: The City of Chicago Cultural Affairs, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

He started a street zine in the early 80's, Special Effects, as a form to express what he experienced and learned through his participation in the disabled and independent living movement. Special Effects was distributed in a street zine fashion, as well as by mailing list.&lt;ref name=humanbeing /&gt;

Marcus curated interventions with a cut, copy and paste methodology which encompassed the art, culture, and humor into the political discourse of disability.

''[[Storm Reading]]'', his play in collaboration with Rod Lathim, Roger Marcus and [[Access Theater]], has been shown on television and performed at the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]], as well as being featured on [[NPR]] and NBC's [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today Show.'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marcus|first=Neil|title=Storm Reading|url=http://www.newsun.com/StormRead.html|work=Play|publisher=The New Sun|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storm Reading challenged audiences to reevaluate conventional ideas about disability and set a standard for performing artists with disabilities, and for performance access technologies.&lt;ref name=bodiesincommotion&gt;"Bodies in Commotion: Disability and Performance." In The University of Michigan press, edited by Carrie Sandahl and Philip Auslander, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Voted ''Best Ensemble and Leading Actor'' in 1992 by DramaLogue Magazine and ''Critic's Choice'' 1992, ''Storm Reading'' had a nearly decade-long run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.disabilityhistory.org/people_marcus.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yergeau, Melanie, Elizabeth Brewer, Brenda Jo Brueggemann, and Nicholas Hetrick. "Biographies of Key Contributors in the Field." Arts and Humanities. Ed. Gary L. Albrecht. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc., 2012. 123-75. SAGE knowledge. Web. Disability Key Issues and Future Directions. 14 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Marcus received the 1994 Isadora Duncan Dance Award for Outstanding Achievement in Sound/Score/Text for his work, ''Art of Human Being'' &lt;ref&gt;http://izzies.org/award-history/music-sound-text/&lt;/ref&gt;

Brenda Jo Brueggemann shares in an anthology about disability and performance, how she introduces to students to her class: " I show a recorded performance of Storm Reading, especially the opening clip. I have used it to open courses on representations of disability in language, language in literature and culture.  I use it first because Marcus begins with the central issue for disabled people: Their position in relation to being 'human.'"&lt;ref name=bodiesincommotion /&gt;

Marcus has since participated in a range of diverse projects. Since 2008, he has been collaborating with [[Petra Kuppers]] in [[The Olimpias Disability Culture Research Projects]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olimpias|title=The Olimpias Disability Culture Research Projects|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~petra/|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2010, Marcus has also worked on a number of projects with Stephen Lichty, a New York based sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sculpture Center|title=Stephen Lichty and Neil Marcus, Study for Special Effects|url=http://sculpture-center.tumblr.com/post/20467067585/stephen-lichty-and-neil-marcus-study-for-special|publisher=Sculpture Center|accessdate=6 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcus's poem ''Disabled Country'' introduces the Smithsonian's permanent web exhibition [http://everybody.si.edu/place EveryBody: An Artifact History of Disability in America].

In 2011, Marcus choreographed a videodance with Richard Chen See, a Paul Taylor dancer.&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/26218519&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 video with sculptor Shane Brodie, Marcus embodies the "abstract" in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUT_g8OMR2I abstract art].

Marcus lives in [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name="berkeleydailyplanet1"/&gt; His papers have been archived by the Bancroft library of the University of California at Berkeley as part of the [http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/artistsdis/ Artists with Disabilities Oral History Project].

'''The One Million Masterpiece''' (abbreviated OMM) is the largest artistic collaboration ever attempted. It is an ongoing project to produce a true piece of global artwork.  As of October 16, 2007, 26,582 artists from 174 countries have participated, with $19,348.57 raised for charities worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The original project website was launched on July 14, 2006 by London-based artist Paul Fisher.  The site uses an Adobe Flash drawing tool to enable members to contribute images drawn on screen using a mouse or digipad, and an AJAX viewer which displays the whole artwork mosaic.

The website has developed and further [[social networking]] elements have been added.  Artists can rate one another's contributions, communicate via messages and maintain a profile page.

==Participation==
Participation is free to anyone with access to the internet.  Participants are each given a square where they can use a built-in drawing tool to create an image.  (These individual images combined are what will make up the final project as a giant mosaic.)  The project is open to, and intended for, all willing participants.  One need not be artistically trained, in order to participate.

'''Celebrity Involvement'''

Celebrity contributors include [[Peaches Geldof]], electric violinist [[Linzi Stoppard]], playwright [[Tom Stoppard]], doctor and health commentator [[Miriam Stoppard]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]] frontman and artist [[Holly Johnson]], cult comedy icon [[Karl Pilkington]], businessman and socialite Sebastien Sainsbury and [[Supremes]] band member [[Susaye Greene]].

==Aims==
'''Artistic and Charitable'''

The One Million Masterpiece aims to produce a piece of public artwork that will provide a snapshot of global society.  It is intended that the final artwork be completed for unveiling on [[World Population Day]] 2008 and hopes to raise over $1 million for the projects charity partners [[Save the Children]], [[Oxfam]], [[ActionAid]] and [[World Cancer Research Fund]].  {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

'''World Record'''

The artwork also officially qualifies as a new world record.  The previous official record for the most artists completing a single picture was held by the painting A Little Dab of Texas, designed by Jim Campbell of [[Brenham]], [[Texas]], United States.  The picture was painted by 25,297 people and was completed in 3 years, 7 months on June 14, 1998.

==Recurring Elements Within Image (Space Monkeys)==

As the project is still underway, it is largely wondered whether the final image will have a thematic unity or if it will be a chaotic series of unrelated images.  Many recurring elements can be found throughout the work.  The most notable of these recurring elements are what have been dubbed "space monkeys."  Space monkeys are small circular faces, typically cartoonish in nature and rudimentary in style.  They are believed to have originated within Laura Dixon's picture—but they soon began to appear in pictures  throughout the project.

Other common recurring elements include:  views of the earth from space, eyes, hearts, and flowers.

==Video Replay of Drawing Process==
The OMM site's adobe drawing tool includes a feature that enables a video replay of the drawing process for each picture.  This feature has led several participants to not only create digital paintings, but also digital videos.  Angeli Arndt uses this feature in her artwork entitled "I'm Always Changing For You," to show a human face changing over time.  This video functionality adds a dimension to the project that is not noticeable when simply viewing still images of the project.

==Exhibition==
When completed The One Million Masterpiece will measure 80 metres in width and 31 meters in height and each individual contribution will be a 5&amp;nbsp;cm by 5&amp;nbsp;cm square. It is proposed that the final piece will be printed and unveiled in Central [[London]] on [[World Population Day]] 2008.  {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

==Controversy==
There has been controversy within the OMM community regarding content of individual artworks.  Some participants have complained that certain artworks are [[pornographic]] and/or [[obscene]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}  Occasionally, a participant will demand that the artwork of another participant be deleted.

      <comment>/* Background and concept */ This is an article on a work of art. The work of art is not presently displayed in the article. The photograph of Emmett Till is serving no purpose at this time. It might be justified if the image of the painting were present. There is no juxtaposition between the source of the painting and painting itself. Removing photograph at this time.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11394">'''''Open Casket''''' is a 2016 painting by [[Dana Schutz]]. It is a portrait of [[Emmett Till]], a black 14-year-old boy who was [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] by two white men in [[Mississippi]] in 1955. It was one of the works included at the ''[[Whitney Biennial]]'' exhibition in New York in 2017. The painting caused considerable controversy, with protests and calls for the painting's destruction.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Randy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/arts/design/painting-of-emmett-till-at-whitney-biennial-draws-protests.html |title=White Artist’s Painting of Emmett Till at Whitney Biennial Draws Protests |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2017-03-21 |accessdate=2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and concept==
Dana Schutz created the painting in August 2016 in response to media coverage of gun violence, in particular, black men being shot by police.&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite news |last3=Boucher |first3=Brian |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/dana-schutz-responds-to-the-uproar-over-her-emmett-till-painting-900674 |title=Dana Schutz Responds to the Uproar Over Her Emmett Till Painting at the Whitney Biennial |work=[[Artnet]] |date=2017-03-23 |accessdate=2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The portrait is based, in part, on a photograph of Till's mutilated  body—his mother had insisted his casket remain open at his funeral to raise awareness of the graphic realities of racism in the U.S.—which was published in ''[[The Chicago Defender]]'' and ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/emmett-till-507515#trial |title=Emmett Till |work=[[Biography (TV series)]] |accessdate=2017-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The photograph of Emmett Till felt analogous to the time: what was hidden was now revealed," Schutz told [[Artnet]].  

The painting was first exhibited in Schutz's fall 2016 solo exhibition, "Waiting for the Barbarians," at Contemporary Fine Arts, Berlin.&lt;ref name=TZK&gt;{{cite news |title=Hannah Magauer on Dana Schutz at CFA, Berling Post-Private Getaways |url=https://www.textezurkunst.de/articles/magauer-schutz-cfa-de/ |work=Texte Zur Kunst |date=2017-01-19 |accessdate=2017-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017, ''Open Casket'' was one of three of Schutz's paintings selected for inclusion in the 2017 Whitney Biennial.&lt;ref name="new yorker"&gt;{{cite news |last=Tomkins |first=Calvin |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/10/why-dana-schutz-painted-emmett-till |title=Why Dana Schutz Painted Emmett Till |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=2017-04-10 |accessdate=2017-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the painting in a profile on Schutz for ''[[The New Yorker]]'', critic [[Calvin Tomkins]] wrote, "Measuring thirty-nine by fifty-three inches, it is smaller than most of her recent paintings, and more abstract. The buildup of paint on the face is a couple of inches thick in the area where Till’s mouth would be. Although there are no recognizable features, a deep trough carved into the heavy impasto conveys a sense of savage disfigurement, which is heightened by the whiteness of the boy’s smoothly ironed dress shirt. His head rests on an ochre-yellow fabric, and deftly brushed colors at the top suggest banked flowers."&lt;ref name="new yorker"/&gt;

==Response==
Soon after the opening of the 2017 Whitney Biennial, African-American artist Parker Bright began to silently protest ''Open Casket'' by standing in front of the painting wearing a T-shirt with "Black Death Spectacle" on the back.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; [[United Kingdom|UK-born]], [[Berlin|Berlin-based]] artist and writer [[Hannah Black]] wrote a letter to the museum's curators&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; demanding both the painting's removal and destruction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am writing to ask you to remove Dana Schutz's painting Open Casket with the urgent recommendation that the painting be destroyed and not entered into any market or museum. As you know, this painting depicts the dead body of 14-year-old Emmett Till in the open casket that his mother chose, saying, 'Let the people see what I’ve seen.' That even the disfigured corpse of a child was not sufficient to move the white gaze from its habitual cold calculation is evident daily and in a myriad of ways, not least the fact that this painting exists at all. In brief: The painting should not be acceptable to anyone who cares or pretends to care about Black people because it is not acceptable for a white person to transmute Black suffering into profit and fun..."&lt;ref name="george-baker"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.textezurkunst.de/articles/baker-pachyderm/ |title=George Baker on Painting, Critique, and Empathy in the Emmett Till/Whitney Biennial Debate |work=Texte Zur Kunst |date=2017-03-29 |accessdate=2017-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These actions led to a conversation in the media on [[cultural appropriation]] by white artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/whitney-biennial-emmett-till_us_58d118b9e4b0be71dcf7cee8?te=Spin |title=White Artist’s Emmett Till Painting Incites Anger At Whitney Biennial |work=[[Huffington Post]] |date=2017-03-21 |accessdate=2017-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Schutz responded through comments to reporters about how and why the painting was made:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I don’t know what it is like to be black in America but I do know what it is like to be a mother. Emmett was Mamie Till’s only son. The thought of anything happening to your child is beyond comprehension. Their pain is your pain. My engagement with this image was through empathy with his mother. [. . .] Art can be a space for empathy, a vehicle for connection. I don’t believe that people can ever really know what it is like to be someone else (I will never know the fear that black parents may have) but neither are we all completely unknowable."&lt;ref name="george-baker"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the relationship between her painting and the photograph of Till, Schutz reportedly said, "The photograph of him in his casket is almost impossible to look at. In making the painting, I relied more on listening to Mamie Till's verbal account of seeing her son, which oscillates between memory and observation."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Schutz has also commented "The painting is very different from the photograph. I could never render the photograph ethically or emotionally."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

Co-curator of the Whitney Biennial containing the painting, Mia Locks, said in defense of the painting's inclusion, "Right now I think there are a lot of sensitivities not just to race but to questions of identities in general. We welcome these responses. We invited these conversations intentionally in the way that we thought about the show." She added that the inclusion of the painting in the Whitney show was a way of "not letting Till’s death be forgotten, as Mamie, his mother so wanted."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

"The subject matter is not Schutz’s," [[Hannah Black]] wrote, in a petition targeting the painting.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; "White free speech and white creative freedom have been founded on the constraint of others, and are not natural rights. The painting must go." She added that "contemporary art is a fundamentally white supremacist institution despite all our nice friends."

In an interview in [[Artnet]] Schutz is asked "Could you have foreseen that you were stepping on a third rail by treating this explosive subject? If so, what made it necessary to paint Emmett Till specifically?" Schutz responded "Yes, for many reasons. The anger surrounding this painting is real and I understand that. It’s a problematic painting and I knew that getting into it. I do think that it is better to try to engage something extremely uncomfortable, maybe impossible, and fail, than to not respond at all."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

Lisa Whittington, a black woman who has also painted pictures on Emmett Till told [[NBC News]] "Art takes courage. It takes courage to create it, to show it, and to listen to people talk about your work. While I appreciate Dana Shutz's courage, and attempt to understand — for me, her understanding is not deep enough and careless. The horror was too gentle in her work. She fell short and did not tell a complete story. She downplayed the details and the emotion his death represented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Whittington |first=Lisa |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/museumssowhite-representation-black-pain-why-emmett-till-painting-matters-n737931 |title=#MuseumsSoWhite: Black Pain and Why Painting Emmett Till Matters |work=NBC News |date=2017-03-26 |accessdate=2017-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian [[George Baker (art historian)|George Baker]] wrote "We may want to believe that empathy has no restrictions but it does have limits. Schutz’s painting, 'Open Casket,' is naive, like most of the artist's work. Not just in its painterly style but in its gesture, its 'logic.' But naiveté edges into something much more sinister here, as the work collapses the destruction of Till's body and face, his murder, with the artist's own aesthetic. This is more narcissism than empathy. (Painting is not good at empathy; one of its founding myths, as Caravaggio long ago reminded us, of course is precisely the myth of Narcissus – the myth of boundless self-love, the myth as well of what Lacan would have called 'mis-recognition.')"&lt;ref name="george-baker"/&gt;

An open letter purportedly from artist Dana Schutz declaring her desire to remove the painting from exhibition was subsequently proven to be a hoax&lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/art-world/dana-schutz-asks-whitney-remove-controversial-emmett-till-painting-901001&lt;/ref&gt;, and ''The New Yorker'' reported that "the museum has been fully supportive of the curators and the artist, and the painting will remain on view throughout the exhibit"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/10/why-dana-schutz-painted-emmett-till&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the calls to destroy the art were clearly rhetorical, and the protest inside the museum petered out a day or two after the show opened."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/does-an-offensive-sculpture-deserve-to-be-burned&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the painting and the surrounding issues were discussed on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Analysis (radio programme)|Analysis]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC Radio 4 Analysis"&gt;{{cite episode| title= Offence, Power and Progress | series= [[Analysis (radio programme)|Analysis]] | credits= Producer: Tim Mansel | network= BBC| station= [[BBC Radio 4]]| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09fy1qp | airdate= 20 November 2017| minutes= 17:45| accessdate= 20 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Orange Is the New Black episodes}}
{{:List of Orange Is the New Black episodes}}
{{expand section|with=Main storyline(s) of seasons 1-4|date=August 2018}}

The series begins revolving around [[Piper Chapman]] ([[Taylor Schilling]]), a woman in her thirties living in New York City who is sentenced to 15 months in Litchfield Penitentiary, a [[Prison#Security|minimum-security]] women's [[federal prison]] in [[upstate New York]]. Chapman was convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money for her girlfriend [[Alex Vause]] ([[Laura Prepon]]), an international [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggler]]. The offense had occurred 10 years prior to the start of the series and in that time Piper had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's [[upper middle class]]. Her sudden and unexpected indictment disrupts her relationships with her fiancé, family and friends. In prison, Chapman is reunited with Vause (who named Chapman in her trial, resulting in Chapman's arrest) and they re-examine their relationship. Simultaneously, Chapman, along with the other inmates, attempt to grapple with prison's numerous, inherent struggles. Episodes often feature [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] of significant events from various inmates' and prison guards' pasts. These flashbacks typically depict how an inmate came to be in prison or develop a character's backstory. The prison is initially operated by the "Federal Department of Corrections" (a fictional version of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]), and was in a later season acquired by the Management &amp; Correction Corporation (MCC), a private prison company.

The fifth season shows the prisoners revolting against the guards, wardens and the system after MCC's failed handling of an inmate's death at the hands of a guard in the fourth season. The inmate death had followed a peaceful protest and subsequent instigation of an inmate fight by another guard. Fueled by the conditions the inmates are forced to tolerate, as well as grudges against the prison guards, a three-day riot ensues, during which some inmates attempt to negotiate better living conditions and seek justice for the death of the inmate, while others pursue their own interests and entertainment, and a few seek no involvement in the riot. At the emergence of the riot, the guard who incited the fight in the prior season is critically shot by an inmate who took the gun the guard illegally brought into the prison. At the end of the season, [[SWAT]] raids the prison to end the riot and remove all inmates from the facility. During this raid, a correctional officer is fatally shot by a corrupt "strike team", which then conspires to blame the guard's death on inmates who hid in an underground bunker and had taken hostage of the guard. All inmates are transported to other prisons.

The consequences of the riot are shown in the sixth season. A number of the inmates, including Chapman and Vause, are transported to Litchfield Maximum Security. Most of these inmates are interrogated, and several of them charged and sentenced for their involvement in the riot. In max, new inmates are introduced, alliances are made, and a gang-like war emerges between two prison blocks, spearheaded by a longstanding feud between two sisters and a grudge harbored by them toward a former maximum-security inmate who returned. Inmates who arrived from the minimum security prison are either caught up or willingly participate in the war between prison blocks. The season portrays further corruption and guard brutality.

Throughout the series, it is shown how various forms of corruption, funding cuts, [[private prison|privatization of prison]], overcrowding, guard brutality and racial discrimination, among other issues, affect the prisoners' safety, health and well-being, the correctional officers, and the prison's basic ability to fulfill its fundamental responsibilities and ethical obligations as a corrections institution.{{citation needed|date=August 2018|reason=cite secondary source(s) for analyses}} One of the show's key conflicts involves the minimum-security prison's Director of Human Activities, Joe Caputo, whose efforts and aims as a [[Prison warden|warden]] constantly conflict with the corporate interests of MCC, which acquired the facility when it was about to be shut down.

[[File:Cast of Orange Is The New Black at Paley Fest.jpg|thumb|right|The series cast at The Paley Center For Media's PaleyFest 2014 event honoring the show]]

Show creator [[Jenji Kohan]] read [[Piper Kerman]]'s memoir after a friend sent it to her. She then set up a meeting with Kerman to pitch her on a TV adaptation, which she notes she "screwed up" as she spent most of the time asking Kerman about her experiences she described in the book rather than selling her on the show. This appealed to Kerman as it let her know that she was a fan and she signed off on the adaptation.&lt;ref name="Collidermay"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Radish |first1=Christina |title=Creator Jenji Kohan Talks ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK, Her Research Into Prison Life, and Graphic Sex Scenes |url=http://collider.com/jenji-kohan-orange-is-the-new-black-interview/ |website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]] |date=July 7, 2013 |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kohan would later go on to describe the main character, [[Piper Chapman]], as a "trojan horse" for the series, allowing it to focus on characters whose demographics would not normally be represented on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Orange' Creator Jenji Kohan: 'Piper Was My Trojan Horse' |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/08/13/211639989/orange-creator-jenji-kohan-piper-was-my-trojan-horse |publisher=NPR |date=August 13, 2013 |accessdate=May 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Panthéon de la Guerre''''' was a monumental artwork painted in [[Paris]] during the [[First World War]], a [[cyclorama|circular panorama]] {{convert|402|ft|m}} in circumference and {{convert|45|ft|m}} high.  It has been described as the largest [[painting]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pantheon-de-la-guerre-wwi-painting/index.html|title=100-year history of WWI's biggest painting|date=2018-10-19|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ca%2033000215/|title=Panthéon de la guerre; panorama of the world war and its heroes, the largest painting in the world, 402 feet long--45 feet high, painted by twenty-eight famous French artists, assisted by more than one hundred other artists under the direction of Pierre Carrier-Belleuse and Auguste-Francois Gorguet and containing six thousand life-size portraits of world war heroes and leaders representing all the allied nations ... with a correct landscape of the battlefields of France and Belgium as they appeared in 1914-1918, reproduced in full color with complete descriptive text ...|date=1932|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The painting included full-length portraits of around 6,000 wartime figures from France and its allies.

The centrepiece was a "Temple to Glory", with portraits of French figures crowding on a staircase of heroes, topped by a gold statue of [[Victory]] holding aloft a crown of laurels in each hand, on a plinth bearing the motto "Aux héros" ("to the heroes").  At the base of the staircase, French political and military leaders stood around a [[Canon de 75 modèle 1897|75mm cannon]].  On the opposite side of the circular painting was a depiction of a war memorial, with four bronze [[poilu]]s holding a coffin covered with the [[French flag]] on a plinth inscribed "Pro patria", and a single woman dressed in black weeping beside a wreath bearing the words "Aux héros ignorés" ("to the forgotten heroes")

National groups of figures from the allied nations lined the painting to either side, four Europeans allies (The United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, Portugal) on one side and 19 others (including the US, Greece, Latin America, Serbia, Montenegro, Tsarist Russia, Romania and Japan) on the other.  The figures were mostly men, but also some female nurses, nuns and spies, such as [[Edith Cavell]], [[Louise de Bettignies]] and [[Émilienne Moreau]].  The work also depicted some French [[cuirassier]]s, [[goumier]]s (troops from Morocco), and veterans ("péperes"), and included a continuous topographical landscape depicting the battlefields of France and Belgium from the North Sea to Switzerland. A section comprising representatives from Asian nations, such as Chinese labourers employed behind the western front, was replaced by US figures when the US entered the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=LIFE|last=Inc|first=Time|date=1953-08-10|publisher=Time Inc|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Czechoslovakia did not exist before World War I, during the war the Czechoslovak Legion recruited men to fight with the Allies on three fronts: France, Italy and Russia.  The Czechoslovak Legion in Russia was composed mostly of POWs from the Austro-Hungarian Army.  On the far right of the main panel of the painting the last flag shown is of the Czechoslovak Legion.  The Legion's flag generally consisted of a white bar over a red bar with coats of arms of Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia and Slovakia in the corners and a crown with garlands in the center or the initials "C S" intertwined as seen here in the detail from the painting and photo of the Legion in France posing with their flag.  This stylized "C S" symbol was used extensively throughout Czechoslovakia during the first republic 1918 - 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbYAySNAnH0C&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Matters of Conflict: Material Culture, Memory and the First World War|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas J.|date=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415280549|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History in Paris==
Work on the painting began in September 1914, after the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]], coordinated by French artists [[Pierre Carrier-Belleuse]] and [[Auguste François-Marie Gorguet]], with contributions from around 130 artists.  The work was undertaken as a private commercial venture, with state support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pantheon-de-la-guerre-wwi-painting/index.html|title=100-year history of WWI's biggest painting|date=2018-10-19|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completed painting was displayed in Paris in a specially built building next to the [[Hôtel des Invalides]], and inaugurated by the French President [[Raymond Poincaré]] in October 1918. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pantheon-de-la-guerre-wwi-painting/index.html|title=100-year history of WWI's biggest painting|date=2018-10-19|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2005679092/|title=Pantheon de la guerre, 1918|date=1918|website=www.loc.gov|language=en|others=Gorguet, Auguste-François-Marie, 1862-1927., Carrier-Belleuse, Pierre, 1851-1932.|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors approached along dark corridors to a central viewing platform.  It was visited by 3 million people between 1918 and 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pantheon-de-la-guerre-wwi-painting/index.html|title=100-year history of WWI's biggest painting|date=2018-10-19|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display in US==
The painting was acquired by US businessmen in 1927 and exported to New York, where it was displayed at [[Madison Square Garden]].  It was seen there by one million visitors in 8 week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pantheon-de-la-guerre-wwi-painting/index.html|title=100-year history of WWI's biggest painting|date=2018-10-19|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some small changes were made to make the work more attractive to a US audience: Colonel [[Edward M. House]] (by then a politician) was painted out and replaced by the US ambassador to France, [[Myron T. Herrick]]; an African-American soldier was also added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308015944/http://www.cityclicker.net/chicfair/guerre.html|title=Century of Progress Exposition -- Pantheon de la Guerre|date=2015-03-08|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work went on a tour of the United States, displayed at the [[Washington Bicentennial Fair]] in Washington DC in 1932, at the [[Century of Progress]] exhibition in Chicago in 1933-34, at the [[Great Lakes Exposition]] at [[Cleveland, Ohio]] in 1936-37, and the [[Golden Gate International Exposition ]] in San Francisco in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pantheon-de-la-guerre-wwi-painting/index.html|title=100-year history of WWI's biggest painting|date=2018-10-19|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It went into storage in 1940, and was acquired by restaurant entrepreneur [[William Haussner]] for $3,400.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/pantheon-de-la-guerre-wwi-painting/index.html|title=100-year history of WWI's biggest painting|date=2018-10-19|work=CNN Style|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theworldwar.org/explore/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/panth%C3%A9on-de-la-guerre|title=Panthéon de la Guerre|date=2013-03-06|work=National WWI Museum and Memorial|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liberty Memorial, Kansas City, Missouri==
Haussner donated the work to [[Leroy Daniel MacMorris]] in 1956 to be adapted for display at Memory Hall in the [[Liberty Memorial]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].  MacMorris greatly reduced the size of the work and modified it emphasise the US contribution to the First World War. Only 7 percent of the original work was retained, and large French sections were left out.  The reconfigured work has been described as a "[[Reader's Digest]]" version, in a [[Cold War]] US nationalist context.  MacMorris also modified some unrecognisable figures in the US delegations to represent later US figures, such as Presidents [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman]] (a First World War veteran, and Missouri native).  Colonel House was added back, and MacMorris also added portraits of Carrier-Belleuse and Gorguet.  The bouquet of flowers previously painting in at the feet of Edith Cavell was placed in front of [[Woodrow Wilson]].

Other fragments of the original painting have survived. Two {{convert|10|xx|16|ft|m}} fragments were displayed in [[Haussner's Restaurant]] in Baltimore until 1999, and were then sold.  The building that housed the work in Paris was destroyed in 1960.

}}'''''Pornocrates''''', '''''Pornokratès''''', '''''La dame au cochon''''', or '''''The Lady with the Pig''''' is a work by the Belgian artist [[Félicien Rops]], created in 1878. It is part of the collection of the Musée provincial Félicien Rops in [[Namur]], Belgium.

The work in Namur is 75&amp;nbsp;cm high and 48&amp;nbsp;cm wide, executed in [[gouache]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolor paint]] heightened with [[pastel]] on paper. Reproductions of the work ([[soft-ground etching]]s, [[Photogravure|heliogravures]] and [[aquatint]]s, sometimes colored) are also present in other museum collections, such as the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art|LACMA]], the [[National Museum of Western Art]] and the [[Rijksmuseum|Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]].

== Description ==
''Pornocrates'' is considered the best-known work by Rops.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museerops.be/oeuvre/2006042001/|title=Pornocratès, 1878|last=Leblanc|first=Véronique|date=20 April 2006|website=Musée provincial Félicien Rops Namur|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was realized at a time when Rops was 45 years old and lived in Paris together with the sisters Léontine and Aurélie Duluc, who both were his [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]] and became mothers to his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lesoir.be/1135786/article/soirmag/soirmag-histoire/2016-02-29/felicien-rops-pornokrates|title=Félicien Rops: Pornokratès|last=Smets|first=Joëlle|date=3 March 2016|website=lesoir.be|publisher=Le Soir|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the work can be translated as "the ruler of [[fornication]]". According to his own correspondence, Rops produced this painting "in an overheated apartment, full of different smells, where the [[Opopanax (plant)|opopanax]] and [[cyclamen]] gave me a slight fever conductive towards production or even towards reproduction".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Letter from Félicien Rops to H. Liesse, 1879.&lt;/ref&gt; The work depicts a woman, holding a [[Domestic pig|swine]] on a leash, viewed from the left side. The woman, said to be a [[courtesan]], is almost naked, with the exception of long black silk gloves, a [[blindfold]], a plumed hat, black shoes and stockings, and a band of gold and blue silk – accessories which only emphasize her nakedness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAsiQA7msZE Felicien Rops Pornocrates] – YouTube video with interpretation of the work&lt;/ref&gt; Above the pig with golden tail, three winged [[Putto|putti]] fly away in what looks like shock or horror. Rops refers to them as "Three loves – ancient loves – vanish in tears".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Meaning of the work ==
Various interpretations for the work exist. The woman can be seen as a powerful female, led by the hog, which can be seen as an image of man, in a bestial, submissive and ignorant state, kept in check by the woman. The pig with golden tail can also be seen as an [[allegory]] for [[Luxury goods|luxury]], or even as an animal of the [[devil]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; a symbol of fornication, steering the woman in [[Visual impairment|blindness]]. In any case the work represents Rops' vision of the woman of his time: a ''[[femme fatale]]'' who was increasingly [[Assertiveness|assertive]], ruthless and [[Seduction|seductive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rijksmuseumamsterdam.blogspot.nl/2013/02/felicien-rops-pornocrates-1878-musee.html|title=Félicien Rops: Pornocrates (1878); Musée Félicien Rops, Namur|last=Dorhout|first=Pauline|date=10 February 2013|website=The World According to Art|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; "She was the human animal viciously depicted by Félicien Rops as "Pornokrates", ruler of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon's]] "Pornocracy", a creature blindly guided by a hog, the symbol of [[Circe]], the bestial representative of all sexual evil".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idols of Perversity.

[[File:Félicien Rops - Pornokratès - 1878 - Frieze with the Arts.jpg|left|thumb|500x500px|Frieze with the Arts]]
The woman and pig are walking on top of a [[marble]] stage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.museerops.be/tech/drawing/pornokrates.html|title=Drawing – Pornokratès|last=|first=|date=|website=Musée Félicien Rops|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a frieze depicting four allegories of the arts: sculpture, music, literature and painting. The fine arts are depicted as grey, [[Classics|classical]] male figures, looking desperate. This might be interpreted as the victory of sensuousness and eroticism of the art that Rops and his contemporaries of the [[Decadent movement]] created, in contrast with the boredom of the [[academic art]] of that era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The title may also refer to the concept of [[Saeculum obscurum|pornocracy]], a period in the [[History of the papacy]] during the first half of the 10th Century where the Popes were strongy influenced by a corrupt aristocratic family, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Theophylacti]]. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon published his [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] tract ''La Pornocratie ou les femmes dans les temps modernes'' in 1875, three years before Rops worked on his ''Pornocrates''.

An early owner of the work was the Belgian jurist and art collector [[Edmond Picard]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; ''Pornocrates'' was received with indignation and scandal during the 1886 exhibition of the [[Les XX|Cercle des XX]], an art group to which Rops belonged.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.numeriques.be/index.php?id=6&amp;no_cache=1&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1%5Bview%5D=item_detail&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1%5Bid%5D=peps%3AMAR-ROPS-APC193&amp;tx_portailnumeriques_pi1%5Bnum%5D=3|title=Pornokratès ou La Femme au cochon|last=|first=|date=|website=numeriques.be|publisher=|access-date=2016-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Post-black art''' is a category of contemporary [[African American art]]. It is a paradoxical genre of art where race and racism are intertwined in a way that rejects their interaction.  I.e., it is art about the black experience that attempts to dispel the notion that race matters.  It uses enigmatic themes wherein black can substitute for white.&lt;ref name=RRJMM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art.newcity.com/2008/09/09/review-rashid-johnsonmonique-meloche/|title=Review: Rashid Johnson/Monique Meloche|accessdate=2009-01-12|year=2008|publisher=Newcity Communications, Inc.|work=Newcity Art|author=Calder, Jaime}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some suggest the term is attributable to the 1995 book ''The End of Blackness'' by [[Debra Dickerson]].

However, [[Thelma Golden]] claimed to have coined the term ‘post-black’ art with friend and artist [[Glenn Ligon]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thelma Golden, ''Freestyle'', exhibition catalogue. (New York: Studio Museum in Harlem, 2001), 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 the phrase was explained in detail in the exhibition catalogue for [[The Studio Museum in Harlem]]’s exhibition entitled "Freestyle." &lt;ref name=RRJMM/&gt; ''Freestyle'' was an exhibition that included twenty-eight up and coming artists of African American backgrounds. Golden defined post-black art as that which includes artists who are “adamant about not being labeled ‘black’ artists, though their work was steeped, in fact deeply interested, in redefining complex notions of blackness.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  She continued, “They are both post-[[Jean-Michel Basquiat|Basquiat]] and post-[[Biggie]]. They embrace the dichotomies of high and low, inside and outside, tradition and innovation, with a great ease and facility.”&lt;ref&gt;Thelma Golden, ''Freestyle'', exhibition catalogue. (New York: Studio Museum in Harlem, 2001), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Meyers interprets this as “cutting edge works that are defined by not being defined as African American art.”&lt;ref&gt; Laura Myers, “African American art moves beyond black and white; collectors, curators and galleries are embracing a greater diversity of genres and styles in African American art while other artists move toward a ‘post-black’ art which cannot be defined in terms of race,” ''Art Business News''  Jan 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Golden stated her initial interest as an attempt to remove some of the negative associations with the phrase black art as well as comment on the diversity of artists of African descent.&lt;ref&gt;“Thelma Golden, Curator,” ''gothamist.com'' April 27 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  In the exhibition catalogue, Golden proclaims, “Post-black was the new black.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

As Golden explained, post-black art refers to a younger, post-[[Civil Rights]] generation of artists who are in search of a language through which they can explore their artistic interests and identities. Because artists of African descent have historically been [[marginalized]] and left outside of the general discourse on Western [[art history]], there has not been one style or school of [[African American art]].&lt;ref&gt;Laura Myers, “African American art moves beyond black and white; collectors, curators and galleries are embracing a greater diversity of genres and styles in African American art while other artists move toward a ‘post-black’ art which cannot be defined in terms of race,” ''Art Business News''  Jan 2003. &lt;/ref&gt;  The term ‘post-black’ attempts to encompass artists who have a variety of backgrounds and experiences, but all share experiences as a person of African descent. 

While the notion of ‘post-black’ attempts to avoid identity labels, the title of ‘post-black’ serves as an ethnic marker. Some have found fault with this terminology, stating, “racism is real, and many artists who have endured its effects feel the museum is promoting a kind of art – trendy, postmodern, blandly international – that has turned the institution into a ‘boutique’ or ‘country club’, as [[David Hammons]] puts it.”&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Solomon, “The Downtowning of Uptown,” ''The New York Times'' Aug 19 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Golden has even stated that ‘post-black’ is “both a hollow social construction and a reality with an indispensable history.”&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Valdez, “Freestyling – Studio Museum in Harlem,” ''Art in America'' Sep 2001. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Artists featured in [[The Studio Museum in Harlem]]’s ''Freestyle'' show included [[Kori Newkirk]], [[Laylah Ali]], [[Eric Wesley]], [[Senam Okudzeto]], [[David McKenzie (artist)|David McKenzie]], [[Susan Smith-Pinelo]], [[Sanford Biggers]], [[Louis Cameron]], [[Deborah Grant (artist)|Deborah Grant]], [[Rashid Johnson]], [[Arnold Kemp]], [[Julie Mehretu]], [[Mark Bradford]] and [[Jennie C. Jones]].

The '''Professional Arts Consortium''' (also known as '''ProArts''') is an association of six [[Boston, Massachusetts]] institutions of [[higher education]] which emphasize the [[visual arts|visual]], [[applied art|applied]], and [[performing arts]]. The consortium allows for shared resources, such as libraries, between member schools. Students of member schools may also cross-register for courses in any other member school. It also maintains the [[Boston Arts Academy]] (BAA), a partnership with the [[Boston Public Schools]]. It is made up of [[Berklee College of Music]], [[Boston Architectural College]], [[Boston Conservatory]], [[Emerson College]], [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]], and the [[School of the Museum of Fine Arts]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4448">The '''''Safvat as-safa''''' ({{lang-fa|صفوة الصفا}}), also spelled '''''Safvat al-safa''''' or '''''Safwat al-safa''''', is a [[hagiography]] of the [[Sufi]] [[sheikh|shaykh]] [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]] (1252–1334), founder of the [[Safaviya (sufi order)|Safaviya]] Sufi order.

== Author ==
The ''Safvat as-safa'' was written by Ebn Bazzaz ({{lang-fa|ابن بزّاز}}) (d. 1391-2), a disciple of Safi ad-Din's son and successor, [[Sadr al-Dīn Mūsā]], who prompted him to write the work.  He probably completed it in 1358.  Little else is known of his life.&lt;ref&gt;B. Nikitine, "Essai d'analyse du Safvat-us-safa," ''Journal Asiatique'' 245 (1957), 385&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Glassen, "Ibn al-Bazzaz al-Ardabili," ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IErSavory"/&gt;

== Content ==
The work is divided into an introduction, 12 chapters (باب), and a conclusion.  Only two of the chapters (chapters 2 and 11) deal with the circumstances of his life.  Most of the rest of the book recounts numerous episodes of the shaykh performing miraculous feats.  The work also includes Shaykh Safi's commentaries on various passages of the Qur'an and hadith.  The contents may be summarized as follows:

*'''Introduction''': Prophecies by the Prophet [[Muhammad]] and various holy men foretelling the coming of Sheikh Safi.
*'''Chapter 1''': Safi ad-Din's genealogy, childhood, discipleship under [[Sheikh Zahed Gilani]], and succession to leadership of the order.
*'''Chapter 2''': Miracles in which Shaykh Safi saved people from perilous situations in the sea, the mountains, or from enemies or illness.
*'''Chapter 3''': Miracles motivated either by Shaykh Safi's grace or displeasure.
*'''Chapter 4''': Safi ad-Din's explanations of difficult passages or apparent contradictions in the Qur'an and hadith.
*'''Chapter 5''': Miracles of Safi ad-Din involving [[jinn]], animals, and non-living things.
*'''Chapter 6''': Safi ad-Din's practice of [[dhikr]].
*'''Chapter 7''': Various miracles performed by Safi ad-Din, such as reading minds, predicting the future, and contact with the dead.
*'''Chapter 8''': Safi ad-Din's virtues and pious acts.
*'''Chapter 9''': Safi ad-Din's final illness and death.
*'''Chapter 10''': Miracles Safi ad-Din performed after he died.
*'''Chapter 11''': The shaykh's greatness and fame throughout the world.
*'''Chapter 12''': Miracles performed by Safi ad-Din's disciples.

== Safavid-era revisions ==
Shaykh Safi ad-Din was a Sunni and an adherent of the Shafi`i school of law.&lt;ref&gt;Zeki Velidi Togan, "Sur l'origine des Safavides," in ''Mélanges Louis Massignon'' 3 (Damascus: Institut Français de Damas, 1957), 353&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1501 the Sufi order he founded became the ruling family in the [[Safavid empire]], but they converted to Shi`ism while at the same time continuing their role as head of the order.  Certain elements in the ''Safvat as-safa'', particularly Shaykh Safi's genealogy and his religious views, became inconsistent with the Safavid dynasty's self-image.  Therefore, in 1542, Shah [[Tahmasp I|Tahmasb]] commissioned Mir Abu al-Fat'h Husayni to revise the ''Safvat as-safa'' to give it an explicit Shi`i tone.  This official version contains textual changes designed to obscure the Kurdish origins of the Safavid family and to vindicate their claim to descent from the Imams.&lt;ref name="IErSavory"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ebn-bazzaz Roger Savory, "EBN BAZZĀZ" in Encyclopædia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions ==
There have been two published editions of the ''Safvat as-Safa''.  The first was a [[lithograph]]ed edition prepared by Mirza Ahmad ibn Hajj Karim Tabrizi and published in [[Bombay]] in 1911.  This has traditionally been the standard edition used by scholars, who call it the Bombay lithograph.  The second published edition appeared in 1994 in [[Tehran]], edited by Ghulam Reza Tabataba'i Majd.  Since Majd based his edition on a larger set of manuscripts of better quality,&lt;ref&gt;Michel M. Mazzaoui, "A 'New' Edition of the ''Safvat al-safa''," in ''History and Historiography of Post-Mongol Central Asia and the Middle East: Studies in Honor of John E. Woods'', ed. Judith Pfeiffer, Sholeh Quinn, and Ernest Tucker. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 306&lt;/ref&gt; it may become the new scholarly standard.

Rhys James studied at [[Loughborough College of Art and Design]] and in 1976 obtained a degree in Fine Art at [[Saint Martin's School of Art]], [[London]].&lt;ref name="BBC Arts 2010" /&gt;

She later moved to Powys to live and work, taking her young family with her.&lt;ref name="WM 2003"&gt;Stephanie McNicholas [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/content_objectid=13615823_method=full_siteid=50082_headline=-Meet-the-women-leading-Wales-name_page.html ''Meet the women leading Wales''], Western Mail, 12 November 2003.

When she is not painting herself she generally paints other women, still lifes, domestic scenes or "riotously spiky and rip-roaring" vases of flowers. Art critic [[Michael Glover (author)|Michael Glover]] says "There's something mad, wild and thuggish about this work, such is its total lack of restraint. It seems to be gulping at colour... She lathers and slathers on the paint with a kind of unrestrained glee. No wonder the eyes of the model are always slightly bulbous with a kind of childish wonderment".&lt;ref name="Glover 2009"&gt;Michael Glover [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/shani-rhys-james-connaught-brown-london-1706796.html ''Shani Rhys James, Connaught Brown, London: Mad dashes and flying colours''], The Independent, 17 June 2009.

: ''Sinfoni Melayu'', a three-movement symphony which tried to combine the musical elements of the country into a synthetic language which called on native drums and xylophones as well as instruments of the full Western orchestra. The last movement ended with a noble professional theme, rather [[Elgar]]ian, representing independence. Then, over a drum roll and before the final chord in C major, the audience was to rise and shout "[[Merdeka]]!"&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{cite book

The score of the symphony appears to have been lost, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthonyburgess.org/anthony-burgess-his-life-work/music/1954-59.htm Music 1954-59], International Anthony Burgess Foundation

'''''Still life with flowers on a marble slab''''' is a 1716 floral painting by [[Rachel Ruysch]]. It is in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]].&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/193049 |title=Still life with flowers on a marble table top, 1716 gedateerd|publisher=[[RKD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history and creation==
This painting is signed and dated 1716, which means it was painted at the end of her time as court painter to [[Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine]] who died that year.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt; Ruysch was then at the peak of her fame and her works sold for large sums in her lifetime. Though the sum paid for this one is unknown, it is known from the study of 17th-century estate inventories that a painting by her hand was worth more than a Rembrandt or a painting by her husband, the portrait painter [[Jurriaen Pool]].

==Description ==
The work shows various insects as well as flowers.
The identified blooms and bugs are: ''[[Cistus]]'', [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]], [[Pansy|''Viola'' × ''wittrockiana'']], ''[[Calendula]]'', ''[[Calystegia]]'', ''[[Dianthus caryophyllus]]'', ''[[Rose|Rosa]]'', [[Green bottle fly]], [[Trichius fasciatus|Bee beetle]], [[wasp]], [[damselfly]], [[burying beetle]], ''[[Dianthus barbatus]]'', ''Saxifragella'', ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]''.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

==Later history and influence==
Rachel Ruysch had many followers. At some point in the 18th-century, this painting was copied, and the copy is kept at the Ashmolean museum. A well-documented copiest of Ruysch's works was the Dutch painter [[Catharina Backer]], who also owned two of Ruysch's paired large canvases, commissioned by her father-in-law, the art collector Pieter de la Court van der Voort, in 1710. It is tempting to think this painting was also in her collection. It was certainly in the collection of another wealthy Dutch woman art collector of note, Lucretia Johanna van Winter, who purchased a painting by Ruysch in 1820 and who when she married, brought a collection of 171 paintings (76 she bought herself). She died in 1845 and after her husband died, her son Pieter Hendrik Six van Vromade sold it in 1908 along with 38 others to the [[Rijksmuseum]]. The most notable paintings that Lucretia Johanna had bought in that group of paintings besides this one, were Vermeer's [[The Milkmaid (Vermeer)|Milkmaid]] and Judith Leyster's [[Serenade (Leyster)|Serenade]] (which had been in the collection as a Frans Hals until 1893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/DVN/lemmata/data/WinterLucretia|title=Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland|first=|last=djr|date=20 March 2017|website=resources.huygens.knaw.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[literary criticism]], '''stream of unconsciousness''' is a [[narrative mode]] that portrays an individual's point of view by transcribing the author's [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] dialogue or ''[[somniloquy]]'' during sleep, in connection to his or her actions within a [[dream]].&lt;ref&gt;"Episode 5: Recent Sleep Works." ''Glossolalia''. [http://glossolalia-ailalossolg.blogspot.com/2010/05/episode-5.html], Resonance 104.4 FM, London. 17 May 2010. Radio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of unconsciousness is characterized by disjointed leaps in ideation and story line, bizarre new word creation, loss of self-censorship, one sided conversations and punctuation that can make the prose both disturbing and difficult to follow.  Despite the name, the stream of unconsciousness occurs more in the form of waves than an actual continuous running stream of dialogue. The stream of unconsciousness is one of several forms of [[dramatic monologue]], where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person. Such monologues are commonly used in [[poetry]] and [[drama]], but with the stream of unconsciousness, the audience or third persons are 'unknowingly' imaginary.  It is primarily a fictional device and often takes the form of a [[tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;"Razen: The Science of Sleep". [http://www.foxydigitalis.com/foxyd/?p=15396], USA. 04 Aug. 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term was introduced to the field of literary studies from that of the independent music industry, where it was redefined by author and artist [[Bryan Lewis Saunders]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Stream of Unconconscious on Stand-Up Tragedy" [http://antonmobin.blogspot.com/2011/06/stream-of-unconscious-on-stand-up.html], France. 13 June 2011 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; For nearly a century the term has been both a misnomer and a [[malapropism]] for the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]].

==History==
The audio recordings of [[Dion McGregor]] (1922–1994) can be perceived as one of the precursors of the 'stream of unconsciousness' (narrative mode), although his monlogues and somniloquy were never transcribed and presented as such.  "Dreams" (1995) by contemporary American artist [[Jim Shaw (artist)|Jim Shaw]] is a collection of  illustrations and extremely detailed dream descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;"Dreams".[https://www.blumandpoe.com/content/jim-shaw-dreams], Los Angeles. 2008 Web.&lt;/ref&gt; "Experiment with Dreams" by [[Leif Elggren]] and Thomas Liljenberg (Stockholm Feb. 1996) may also be attributed to the formation of this method.&lt;ref&gt;"Experiment with Dreams". [http://web.comhem.se/elggren/experiment.html], Stockholm. Feb. 1996 Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable works==

Examples of notable works employing the stream of unconsciousness narrative mode are:
*"Le Bobcat" Bryan Lewis Saunders and Raymond Dijkstra. Short Story on Cassette ([[Fragment Factory]] 2010)
*"The Reasons Why I Dream With Knives" Bryan Lewis Saunders. Nonfiction Book (Stand-Up Tragedy 2010)
*"The Confessor" is a book on tape composed of 24 album chapters on 12 audio cassettes.  With each album serving as a chapter, over 24 musicians and experimental sound artists created music for the unconscious epic poem by Bryan Lewis Saunders. "The Confessor" was created from app. 30 nights of somniloquy and dream descriptions. Poem and Book on Tape (Stand-Up Tragedy 2011)
*"Protective Geometry" [[Ed Pinsent]] and Bryan Lewis Saunders. Comic Book. (2012)

'''''The Adoration of the Shepherds''''' is a painting of the [[Adoration of the shepherds| traditional subject]] which was painted during the last year of [[El Greco]]'s life. The painting is a work which the artist made to hang over his own tomb in the [[Monastery of Saint Dominic of Silos (the Old)|church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].&lt;ref name="M"&gt;M. Tazartes, ''El Greco'', 172&lt;/ref&gt; El Greco's signature, in [[Greek language|Greek]], may be seen in the lower left corner.&lt;ref name="Ca"&gt;From El Greco to Cézanne (catalogue), ''The Adoration of the Shepherds'', 130&lt;/ref&gt;

Extreme distortion of body characterizes the ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' like all the last paintings of El Greco.The infant Christ seems to emit a light which plays off the faces of the barefoot shepherds who have gathered to pay homage to his miraculous birth. A rhythmic energy animates the painting, expressed in the dance-like motions of the figures. Striking contrasts between light and dark passages heighten the sense of drama. The group of angels which hovers over the scene may resemble the missing section of ''[[The Opening of the Fifth Seal]]''.&lt;ref name="Ca" /&gt;

'''''The Old Lacemaker''''' (circa 1655) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Nicolaes Maes]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Mauritshuis]].

The painting shows a woman making [[bobbin lace]] and the [[lace pillow]] she is using is the same in all the paintings Maes made of lacemakers:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1914, who wrote; "71. An Old Lace-Maker. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. Suppl.]] 7. An old woman with spectacles, facing the spectator, sits making lace. She wears a black 
jacket with scarlet sleeves. Over her head hangs a basket of eggs. On a dresser at the side is some crockery. " A masterly production but a little darkened by time" (Sm.).

The 1836 sale was at Christie's lot 60, and the buyer was Colemna.&lt;ref name=RKD&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/explore/images/10631|title=Explore Nicolaes Maes|website=rkd.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 it came on the market again and the museum was able to purchase it with support from VSB Fonds Den Haag, [[Vereniging Rembrandt]], and Vrienden van het Mauritshuis.&lt;ref name=RKD/&gt;

The '''Unknown Confederate Dead Monument in Perryville''' is located in the vicinity of [[Perryville, Kentucky|Perryville]], in [[Boyle County, Kentucky]], [[United States]], in the Goodknight Cemetery, a small family cemetery on private land.  It is presumed to have been constructed around the year 1928, sixty-six years after the [[Battle of Perryville]] on October 8, 1862, in which the Confederate soldiers buried here anonymously died.  In total, 532 Confederates died at the battle, but it is unknown how many of this number are buried here.&lt;ref name="PerryvilleKentucky"&gt;[http://www.trailsrus.com/monuments/reg4/perryville.html Perryville, Kentucky] trailsrus.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noe, Kenneth W., ''Perryville: This Grand Havoc of Battle'', (University Press of Kentucky), 2001. pg.369&lt;/ref&gt;

The headstone is approximately seven feet (2.1 m) tall, and is made of a marble and granite composite. It has an 18-inch (46&amp;nbsp;cm) tall marble scalloped decorative cap, a granite body six inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm) thick with an inscription, stating that it honors the unknown number of Confederate soldiers buried here anonymously, and a marble base of {{convert|4|by|2|ft|cm}}.  Despite being on private property, it was the federal government that erected the monument.&lt;ref name="PerryvilleKentucky" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brent, Joseph. ''Unknown Confederate Dead Monument in Perryville NRHP Nomination Form'' (Kentucky Heritage Council, 1997) Sec7,8,9, pg.1&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 1997, the Unknown Confederate Dead Monument in Perryville was one of sixty different monuments related to the [[Civil War in Kentucky]] placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], as part of the [[List of Civil War Monuments of Kentucky|Civil War Monuments of Kentucky]] [[Multiple Property Submission]]. Three other monuments on this Multiple Property Submission are also in Boyle County.  Two of them are in the nearby [[Perryville Battlefield State Historic Site]] by the visitor center: the [[Confederate Monument in Perryville]] and the [[Union Monument in Perryville]].  The other is in downtown [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]]: the [[Confederate Monument in Danville]].  Many of the other memorials in graveyards have numerous unknown soldiers, but this is the only one which has no soldiers with known names.&lt;ref&gt;Brent pg.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Multiple Property Submission: Civil War Monuments in Kentucky, 1865-1935|url={{NRHP url|id=64500229}} |format=pdf|date=January 8, 1997 |author=Joseph E.
