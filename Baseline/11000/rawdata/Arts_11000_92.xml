'''''Time for Tea: Women, Labor and Post-colonial Politics on an Indian Plantation''''' (2011) is a [[Postcolonial feminism|post-colonial feminist]] ethnographic critique of labour practices in [[India]]n [[tea]] [[plantation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. Through personal interviews, anecdotes and a play, Piya Chatterjee examines the role gender, class, and race play in the production, consumption and circulation of tea. Transcending the realm of local politics and culture, the ethnography reveals the multilayered, multispatial, colonial dimension of gendered labour. She begins by deconstructing the image of the tea box itself to showcase how the image of the exotic tea-plucking women distracts the consumer from the harsh working conditions of plantations. By providing a historical account of the tea industry in India, Chatterjee reveals the intricate link between colonialism and the gendered division of labour in North Bengalese plantations. While gender is her main unit of analysis, Chatterjee explores the way in which colonialism has shaped and continues to shape, the patriarchal and class-based nature of plantations. Coming from a [[Global South]] perspective, she demonstrates the intersectionality of gender, class and race, as mutually constitutive mechanisms of oppression. Throughout the novel, she acknowledges her own privilege as a Global South academic and highlights the difficulties of speaking for the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]].

== Awards ==
* Recipient of the John Franklin Hope Book Award from [[Duke University]] press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dukeupress.edu. Duke University Press. 2001."A Time for Tea."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Review ==
* “A kaleiodoscopic account of the phenomenon of tea, incorporating dramatic interludes via [[Antonin Artaud]]’s theatre of the absurd, the poetics of [[Edward Said]] and the opiatic imagination of [[Lewis Carroll]], depicting the role tea plays in the high and low drama of empire building as it was and remain in transformation.”&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, Sheleyah A. 2004. A time for tea: Women, labor, and Post/Colonial politics on an indian plantation. ''The Australian Journal of Anthropology'' 15, (1): 111.&lt;/ref&gt;–''[[The Australian Journal of Anthropology]]''
* “Those searching for an argument about the postcolonial tea economy, or to learn the history of trade unionism on the North Bengal Tea plantation, or even to gain a better understanding of the complexity of gender, caste, and ethnic relations in the region will be disappointed. […] Her book is more properly read as a meditative and reflective work and deserves to be judged on these terms.”&lt;ref&gt;Visweswaran, Kamala. 2003. "Piya Chatterjee.

'''Aert Anthoniszoon''' (abbreviated '''Anthonisz.''') or '''Anthonissen''', also known as '''Aart''' or '''Aert van Antum''' (born {{circa|1579–1580}}; buried 7 September 1620) was a Dutch [[Marine art|marine painter]].

==Life and career==
Aert Anthoniszoon was born at [[Antwerp]]. His parents moved the family to [[Amsterdam]] in 1591. He was possibly a pupil of [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom]]. In 1603, when he married Baycken Coutermans from [[Mechelen]] he signed a document in Amsterdam stating that he was 23 years old and had lived there for 12 years. He gave her a [[power of attorney]] to settle an inheritance in Mechelen in 1614. He was buried in the [[Zuiderkerk]] of Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="RKD"&gt;{{citation|title=Aert Anthonisz.|url=https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/2053|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919015839/https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/2053|archivedate=19 September 2017|publisher=[[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD)|date=30 March 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1973 Anthoniszoon was known as Aart or Aert van Antum, as his signatures on early paintings were interpreted as "Aert [van] Antum". Later research showed his signature to be "AERT ANT[...]", with the letters of his surname included with varying degrees of completion. One reason so little is known of him is that his life and work were overlooked or omitted by early 17th- and 18th-century painter biographers such as [[Arnold Houbraken]].&lt;ref name="RKD"/&gt;

Anthoniszoon was the father of the marine painter [[Hendrick van Anthonissen]].&lt;ref name="RKD"/&gt; A seapiece by him, signed "A. A.", is in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Berlin Museum]].

'''Anne Henslow Barnard''' (1833–1899) was a 19th-century botanical artist.

[[File:Lacaena spectabilis - Curtis' 106 (Ser. 3 no. 36) pl 6516 (1880).jpg|thumb|''Lacaena spectabilis'' illustrated by Anne Henslow Barnard in Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]
==Biography==
Anne Henslow was born in 1833.&lt;ref name=natstand/&gt;&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; She was the youngest daughter&lt;ref name=walters/&gt; of botanist and Cambridge University professor [[John Stevens Henslow]] and Harriet Jenyns, who was the daughter of clergyman [[George Leonard Jenyns]] and the sister of naturalist [[Leonard Jenyns]].&lt;ref name=jenyns/&gt;{{rp|46}} Her older sister [[Frances Harriet Hooker|Frances Harriet]] married botanist [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]],&lt;ref name=jenyns/&gt;{{rp|264}} and one of her brothers, George, became a professor of botany.&lt;ref name=maries/&gt;

In 1859 she married army officer Robert Cary Barnard, who was the son of an old friend of her father's.&lt;ref name=walters/&gt;&lt;ref name=darwin/&gt; They had eight children.&lt;ref name=natstand/&gt;&lt;ref name=darwin2/&gt;

Barnard's father was one of the first Cambridge University professors to give illustrated lectures, for which he used poster-size illustrations. Some of these were based on rough sketches by Barnard that were then finished by the botanical artist [[Walter Hood Fitch]].&lt;ref name=porter/&gt;

She contributed plates to ''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]'' in the years 1879–94.&lt;ref name=desmond/&gt; She also illustrated [[Daniel Oliver]]'s 1864 ''Lessons in Elementary Biology'', which was built on a manuscript left by her father. It stayed in print for several decades.&lt;ref name=desmond/&gt; Although her output was not large, she was considered a very fine botanical artist.&lt;ref name=harris/&gt;

She died on 19 January 1899.&lt;ref name=desmond/&gt;

The '''Australian International Design Awards''' is an industry body established by the [[Industrial Design Council of Australia]] (IDCA), founded in 1958. The awards are [[Australia|Australia's]] only national design awards for [[industrial design]]. Since 1991, the Australian International Design Awards has been a division of [[Standards Australia]].

In 2007 the Australian Design Awards expanded its entry criteria to include all professionally designed products on the Australian market, including products designed in Australia. From 2007, the Australian Design Awards became known as the Australian International Design Awards to reflect the global nature of the awards.

The Australian International Design Awards has been recognised by the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] and the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsid.org ICSID] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906041307/http://www.icsid.org/ |date=6 September 2009 }}.org&lt;/ref&gt; as a promotional body for the Australian design industry.

In 1958 the Industrial Design Council of Australia (IDCA) was established&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=362218|title=Industrial Design Council of Australia Archive|website=www.powerhousemuseum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  funded by the Commonwealth Government. The goal was to educate [[Manufacturer|manufacturers]] and consumers on the value of design, encourage and promote high standards of design in [[Manufacturing|manufactured]] goods.

From 1964 Good Design Labels began to appear on products and the Australian Design Index became a register of the best designed products in Australia. A panel of experts reviewed items for inclusion in the Index. Products meeting the criteria received the Good Design Label and other manufacturers were given constructive criticism on how to improve their products.

In 1964, the IDCA opened the first Australian Design Centre in [[Melbourne]] with a special exhibition of selected products from the Australian Design Index. Federal and state government funding helped establish a new Design Centre in [[Sydney]], with more centres to follow in other cities. 

In 1967 the Prince Philip Prize for Australian Design was set up, supported by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], with the aim of promoting greater awareness of good design in Australian [[engineering]]. The inaugural Prince Philip Prize was awarded in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Ian|title=Prince Philip Prize - STILL Winners|url=http://ianwongresearch.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/prince-phillip-design-prize-still.html|website=Industrial Design in Victoria|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 90 entries were received and the winning entry was a self-propelled grain header, designed by Kenneth Gibson. The Prince Philip Prize continued for twenty years.

The IDCA faced funding difficulties in the mid-1970s and was forced to close temporarily in 1976. A new funding injection from the Commonwealth Government helped the Council reopen and a new 'innovation' recognition program was introduced.

Recognising not only high quality but innovative Australian designed products, the Australian Design Award (ADA) program became a valuable promotional tool for manufacturers and designers and provided a source of revenue for the IDCA to continue its operations. The Prince Philip Prize continued to be awarded, but only to products which had received the ADA.

During this time, publicity was at an all-time high. Televised coverage of the Awards presentation on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC TV]] reached audiences of over four million and in 1979, the first annual yearbook of ADA winners was published. 

For the next two decades, however, continuing funding issues, dwindling industry support and a lack of clear direction plagued the IDCA. In 1987 in an effort to reinvigorate the movement, the government re-launched the IDCA as the Australian Design Council and the Prince Philip Prize was folded, leaving the ADA as Australia's top design accolade.

In 1991, control of the Australian Design Council and the ADA program moved to [[Standards Australia]]. Under Standards Australia, the ADA program continued to run, but the Australian Design Council was disbanded in 1993. New formats and incentives for the ADA program such as the Australian Design Mark certification scheme were trialled during the second half of the '90s without success. In 1997 a revamped format was introduced to the Awards, using an online application form and first round internet shortlisting. It attracted more than one hundred applications. The first Presentation Night was held at the [[The Metro Theatre|Metro Theatre]] in Sydney. In 1998, profession-based categories were introduced.

However, the program was threatened by significant [[operating costs]]. The 1999 program was put on hold while Standards Australia explored other options to secure the future of the awards. The majority of staff was made redundant and for the first time in many years, no Design Awards were presented in Australia. The Design Institute of Australia was approached to take over the program but the financial commitment to posed too great a risk. 

Armed with a new business plan and financial model, the Board of Standards Australia approved another year for the awards. For the next few years, the ADA continued to grow in standing and support, buoyed by financial stability. A student design category was launched in 2002 supported by [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Appliances]] Australia and in 2004, product-focused categories were introduced.

In 2008, on the 50th anniversary of rewarding design and innovation excellence in Australia, internationally designed products available for sale in Australia were allowed to enter the awards for the first time. This bold move was aimed at raising the stakes for good design once again, allowing Australian design to be benchmarked against the best in the world. With the ongoing support of the design industry and Standards Australia, this opens the door to the next chapter in the history of the Design Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://designawards.com.au/retrospective.jsp 50 Year Retrospective of the Australian International Design Awards 1958–2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003130032/http://designawards.com.au/retrospective.jsp |date=3 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F07 0054.Ma.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Bison carved on reindeer [[antler]] fragment, National Museum of Prehistory in [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]]]]
'''''Bison Licking Insect Bite''''' is a [[prehistoric art|prehistoric carving]] from the [[Upper Paleolithic]], found at [[Abri de la Madeleine]] near [[Tursac]] in [[Dordogne]], France, the [[type-site]] of the [[Magdalenian]] culture, which produced many fine small carvings in antler or bone.

Created sometime between 20,000 and 12,000 [[Before present|BP]] (15,000 BP according to the museum), it was formerly in the [[National Archaeological Museum (France)|Musee des Antiquites Nationales]], [[St. Germain-en-Laye]], but has been transferred to the expanded National Museum of Prehistory in [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]] that opened in 2004, not far from its findspot. It is a carved and engraved fragment of a [[spear-thrower]] made of [[reindeer]] antler. It depicts the figure of a [[bison]], of the now extinct species [[steppe wisent]] (''bison priscus'') with its head turned around and showing its tongue extended. It is thought the spear-thrower was broken into roughly its present shape before the carving was made from the fragment, hence the need to show the turned-back head of the animal in order to fit the existing structure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://musee-prehistoire-eyzies.fr/en/collection/tid-4/cid-5/collection-bison-se-lechant, "Collections", National Museum of Prehistory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430045958/http://musee-prehistoire-eyzies.fr/en/collection/tid-4/cid-5/collection-bison-se-lechant%2C |date=2015-04-30 }} in Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''book town''' is a town or village with a large number of [[used book]] or antiquarian [[Used bookstore|book stores]]. These [[Bookselling|stores]], as well as [[literary festival]]s, attract [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] tourists. A number of the book towns are members of the International Organisation of Book Towns.

'''Central Talent Booking''' is a [[New York City|New York]]-based [[booking agency]] with offices in [[Los Angeles]].  Since its founding in 1999, CTB has built its business primarily by finding [[celebrity]] and [[human interest]] talent for television programs, particularly [[talk shows]], though the company has regularly worked with [[publishers]], developers of [[web content]] and [[band (music)|music groups]].

==History==

Founded by Joanna Jordan in 1999, Central Talent Booking began in a small, home office after Jordan had spent five years working as the in-house booker at the [[Late Show with David Letterman]]. According to a ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' article, when Jordan told Late Show executives of her plans to start her own company, they offered her their business as the company's first client.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana. "Niche-Oriented." Hollywood Reporter 12 Dec 2005 &lt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001614834&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  CTB booked guests for two of the Late Show's [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series|Emmy]]-award winning seasons, in addition to three others won while Jordan and other CTB staffers were still working for Letterman.

CTB continued to grow well into the 21st Century, picking up business from runaway hits such as [[Punk'd]] and [[Best Week Ever]], and by 2007 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' was already calling Jordan "one of the industry's premier bookers."&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana. "Booking talkshows spawn rigid rules." Variety 5 Oct 2007 &lt;http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117973524.html?categoryid=1019&amp;cs=1&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

CTB has also been noted by industry observers for raising the profile of one of the company's bigger clients, [[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]] In a 2008 article, [[TV Guide]] referred to Jordan as the "force behind" the [[Jimmy Kimmel Live!#"I'm Fucking Ben Affleck" video|'I'm F-ing Ben Affleck' video]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Zoë. "She's Booking Ben Affleck!". TV Guide 6 June 2008: 36.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Can't find a URL for the article, but here's a link to a scan of it: https://www.flickr.com/photos/49429632@N03/4535619880/--&gt; and in the same article Kimmel quipped, "I wish I'd had her in high school when I was looking for a date to the prom."

[[File:Korea-Silla kingdom-Gold crown from Hwangnam Daechong-No.191-01D.jpg|thumb|right|A gold crown from Hwangnamdaechong National Treasure No. 191.]]
The '''[[Crown (headgear)|crowns]] of Silla''' were made in the [[Korea]]n kingdom of [[Silla]] approximately in the 5th&amp;ndash;7th centuries.

These crowns were excavated in [[Gyeongju]], the former capital of Silla, and are designated [[National treasures of South Korea]].

The Silla crowns are very fragile and weigh more than one kilogram.  The Silla kings probably did not wear the golden crowns regularly.  They were probably used only for formal and ceremonial occasions.

== Introduction ==
[[File:Korea-Silla Kingdom-Golden hat-01.jpg|thumb|left|A golden inner cap of a Silla crown from the sixth century.]]
[[File:Korea-National.Folk.Museum-01.jpg|thumb|right|The crown jewels of Silla.]]
The Silla crowns were uncovered in the [[tumuli]] of [[Gyeongju]], [[South Korea]], the capital of [[Silla]] and [[Unified Silla]].  Silla tumuli, unlike their [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]] counterparts were made inaccessible because the tombs did not include passageways and corridors.  Instead, deep pits were dug and lined with wood and this is where the treasures and coffin were placed.  These burial pits were covered in dirt and sealed with clay and then the surface was covered with massive river boulders which were then covered with massive mounds of dirt.  The heavy boulders also served to push the tombs deeper into the ground {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}, thus making them even more inaccessible.  The Silla burial mechanism made it so that grave robbers and foreign invaders could never steal their precious contents.  Some of the crowns are made of pure gold and were probably reserved for kings.  Other crowns have been discovered made from gilt-bronze or gold-plated bronze, probably for princes or lesser kings.  Silla crowns have been excavated from the 5th century [[Gold Crown Tomb]], and the 6th century [[Gold Bell Tomb]] and [[Heavenly Horse Tomb]].&lt;ref name="Golden treasures"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sila/hd_sila.htm|title=Golden Treasures: The Royal Tombs of Silla – Essay – Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History – The Metropolitan Museum of Art|first=Author: Soyoung|last=Lee|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adoption of Buddhism by the Silla kings in 528 A.D. led to the eventual decline of the practice of burying gold artifacts in tombs and by the end of the sixth century the practice had stopped.&lt;ref name="Golden treasures" /&gt;

== Symbolism of the crown ==
[[File:TilliaTepeCrown2.jpg|thumb|This crown was excavated from Grave Six in [[Tillia Tepe]], Afghanistan and is estimated to be from the first or second century.  The style of the crown strongly suggests a Scytho-Iranian connection with Korea.]]
The styling of the outer part of the crowns suggests a Korean connection with the Scytho-[[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] ([[Saka]]) and the people of the [[Eurasian nomads|Eurasian]] [[steppe]].  The crowns are a uniquely Korean product and show no Chinese influence. The Silla crown is also notably distinct from the [[crown of Baekje]], the [[crown of Gaya]], and the crown of Goguryeo kingdoms.  The tree motif of the crown is commonly believed to represent the idea of the [[world tree]] which was an important tenet of Siberian and Iranian shamanism.&lt;ref name="Golden treasures" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kidder"&gt;{{cite book| last=Kidder |first=J. Edward |title=Early Japanese Art: The Great Tombs and Treasures | publisher=D Van Nostrand Company Inc | page=105 |date=1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some believe that the trident-like protrusions symbolize mountains or even birds.  Additionally, the antler-like prongs also indicate a strong connection to [[Korean Shamanism]] or the importance of the reindeer.  A crown in [[Afghanistan]] (see image) bears a strong resemblance to the other Korean crowns which is also evidence of a Scytho-Iranian connection.  Additionally, the sophisticated [[metalworking]] of the crowns show that Silla gold smiths held an advanced knowledge of working with gold.  Some have even theorized that these advanced [[goldworking]] techniques, such as [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]] and [[filigree]], came from the Greek or the [[Etruscan people]], especially because Silla tumuli also contain beads and glassware which came from as far away as the Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/05/eak/ht05eak.htm|title=Korea, 1–500 A.D. - Timeline of Art History – The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But researches and historical documents suggest a [[Persian people|Persian]] connection or even origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/1500-years-contact-between-korea-and-middle-east|title=1,500 Years of Contact between Korea and the Middle East|work=Middle East Institute|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SillaCrownGuimet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A crown of [[Silla]] made in 5-6th century exhibited at [[Musée Guimet]] in [[Paris]].]]

The delicate nature of the gold crowns comes from the fact they were made from cutting thin sheet gold. The crown is impractical to wear and some believe that the crown may have been made specifically as a burial good.&lt;ref name="Golden treasures" /&gt;  The use of [[gogok]], or comma-shaped curved jewels also point to an Iranian influence and the importance of the bear cult.{{what|date=July 2017}}  There may also be a connection with [[ancient Japan]] because the gogok were used extensively by the ruling elite of that society as well.  These comma-shaped jewels of jade and glass may have symbolized the fruits and the bounty of trees.  The use of many tiny gold mirrors dangling from the crown has led some to hypothesize that the crown, worn in sunlight, would be a dazzling spectacle reinforcing the tradition role of the Silla king as the symbolic representation of the sun on earth.

The crowns come in two major parts.  The inner part is a golden cap, which may have been covered in silk.  This cap would sit within the band of the outer crown.  There is a third part of the crown, namely the chains of gold with attached jade that may have been attached to the outer band.  However, there is significant controversy over how the crown was supposed to be worn.  Some believe that the three total parts were supposed to be worn together in one crown.  However, the fact that the three parts of the crown have been found in three distinct areas of certain tombs, such as the [[Heavenly Horse Tomb]] suggests that the three objects are, in fact, three different types of crowns for different occasions.

South Korea has officially designated some Silla crowns as ''national treasures'' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=[[wikt:國|국]] [[wikt:寶|보]]|rr=gukbo}}), others as ''treasures'' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=[[wikt:寶|보]] [[wikt:物|물]]|rr=bomul}}).

| &lt;div align="center"&gt;'''National Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;87'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The '''Gold Crown from Geumgwanchong''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=금관총 금관|hanja={{linktext|金|冠|塚|金|冠}}|rr=Geumgwanchong geumgwan|mr=Kŭmgwanch'ong kŭmgwan}}) is the largest golden crown discovered. The [[Gold Crown Tomb]] (''Geumgwanchong'') was named after this treasure.  It was designated as a national treasure on December 12, 1962.

The crown is 44&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height and has a diameter of 19&amp;nbsp;centimeters.  It is the largest golden crown from Silla discovered thus far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pennfamily.org/KSS-USA/460910-15.htm|title=Display Detail Information|website=www.pennfamily.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two parts to this crown.  The outer band was discovered within the tomb while the inner cap was found outside of the tomb.  The outer band consists of three tree-like branches which have three branches each.  The [[Chinese character]] {{script|Hant|[[wikt:出|出]]}} ''chul'' is written three times on the hand band {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.  Additionally, the outer head band also has two antler-like protrusions on the left and right side.  All of the protrusions have jade and glass beads and tiny golden mirrors that dangle from the branches.  On the sides of the headband also are two chains of gold with leaf-like decorations that end with jade jewels.  These two chains hang below the head band.

The inner crown is a triangle-shaped hat made of thin sheet gold and has two wing-like decorations on it.  The wings are believed to relate to Korean shamanistic beliefs.

The crown is currently housed in the [[Gyeongju National Museum]] and is a masterpiece of Korean art.

| &lt;div align="center"&gt;'''National Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;188'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The '''Gold Crown from Cheonmachong''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=천마총 금관|hanja={{linktext|天|馬|塚|金|冠}}|rr=Cheonmachong geumgwan|mr=Ch'ŏnmach'ong kŭmgwan}}) is currently housed in Gyeongju National Museum.  The crown was designated as the 188th National Treasure of Korea on December 7, 1978.  The crown was found in Cheonmachong (Tomb No.&amp;nbsp;155, also known as The [[Heavenly Horse Tomb]]) in 1973 and is believed to be the crown of King [[Soji of Silla|Soji]] or King [[Jijeung of Silla|Jijeung]].

The crown is 32.5&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height.

There are three prongs forming the Chinese character {{script|Hant|[[wikt:山|山]]}} “mountain” on the front of the crown.  There are also two prongs in the shape of a deer antler on the back.  This crown also has two dangling chains of gold in the shape of leaves hanging from the end of the headband.  Notably, the tree-like prongs of this crown have four branches instead of the more common used three branch motif.  There is still controversy of how this crown was to be worn because of where it was found in the tomb in relation to the coffin.

| &lt;div align="center"&gt;'''National Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;191'''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;The '''Gold crown from Hwangnamdaechong'''({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=황남대총 북분 금관|hanja={{linktext|皇|南|大|塚|北|墳|金|冠}}|rr=Hwangnamdaechong bukbun geumgwan}}) is currently housed in the [[National Museum of Korea]] and is one of the most popular exhibits there, along with the two [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (disambiguation)|Bangasayusang]]&lt;!--good link to DAB page--&gt;.  It is a National Treasure of Korea and was named as one on December 12, 1978.  The height of the crown is 27.5&amp;nbsp;centimeters and the gold chains and pendants that dangle from the crown, known as ''Suhasik'' are 13 to 30.3 centimeters in length.  The crown is known for its abundant use of jade.  The ''Suhasik'' are grouped into two groups of three and are arranged with the longest chains on the outer edge to the smallest chains closest to the front of the crown.  The ''Suhasik'' also hold blue jade and golden leaves on the end of the chains.  There is still a controversy of whether the ''Suhasik'' are actually a part of the crown, namely because the ''Suhasik'' were found separate from the crown when excavated.  The crown has three tree-like prongs with three branches each and also has two antler-like prongs on the left and right side of the main band.  The tree-like prongs of the crown have been interpreted by some scholars as the Chinese character for “mountain”.  Decorations of a deer antler are attached to the ends of the crown.  77&amp;nbsp;pieces of [[jade]] were adorned on the crown.  Sixteen pieces of comma-shaped blue jade were attached to the Chinese characters, nine pieces of jade on the deer antler, and eleven pieces on the head girdle.  This crown is particularly noted for its abundant use of jade.

This crown may have been made for a queen and there is a significant controversy about who was buried in the tomb.

| &lt;div align="center"&gt;'''Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;338'''&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;This crown, known as '''Gold crown from Geumnyeongchong Tumulus''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=금령총 금관|hanja={{linktext|金|鈴|塚|金|冠}}|rr=Geumnyeongchong geumgwan|mr=Kŭmnyŏngch'ong kŭmgwan}}), is currently housed at the [[National Museum of Korea]].  At 27&amp;nbsp;centimeters in heights and 15&amp;nbsp;centimeters in diameter, it is the smallest Silla crown discovered thus far, and the simplest.  Like a typical Silla crown, it has five main prongs.  The tree-like prongs, shaped like the Chinese character {{script|Hant|[[wikt:出|出]]}} ''chul'', which means “going out”, are placed on the front and sides of the headband.  The tree-like prongs have four branches each.  There are two antler-like prongs which flank the two side tree-like prongs.  Additionally, there are birds on top of each branch.  On the upper and lower part of the surface are two-lined spot patterns made with a stamping technique.  Hanging ornaments hang at the right and left side of the crown frame.

This crown has the distinction of being the only gold crown made solely of gold without any jade accoutrements.

&lt;br /&gt;The '''Gold crown from Seobongchong Tumulus''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=서봉총 금관|hanja={{linktext|瑞|鳳|塚|金|冠}}|rr=Seobongchong geumgwan|mr=Sŏbongch'ong kŭmgwan}}) is a gold crown of Silla origin that is now housed at the [[Gyeongju National Museum]].

The crown is 30.7&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height, 18.4&amp;nbsp;centimeters in diameter, and 24.7 high when the ornaments hanging from the headband.  There are five branches standing on the broad crown frame which is stamped with a wave pattern and stamped in a form of a dotted line.  The headband is decorated with leaf-shapes and bent jade.

The right and left most branches, along with the middle branches of the five branches, are composed of the Chinese character {{script|Hant|[[wikt:出|出]]}} in three prongs.  The tips of the branches are decorated with a budding flower ornament.

Two crossing gold belts having the tip on the each 4 dividing points of the crown frame, construct the inside framework.
At the both sides of the crown frame, styled-earrings are dangling from the headband.

|[[File:Silver Crown from the South Mound of Hwangnamdaechong Tomb.jpg|center|250px]]
| &lt;div align="center"&gt;'''Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;631'''&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The '''Silver crown''' ({{Ko-hhrm|hangul=은관〈98호 남분〉|hanja={{linktext|銀|冠}}〈98號南墳〉
|rr=eun(-)gwan (98[=&amp;nbsp;gusippal]ho nambun)|mr=ŭn'kwan (98[=&amp;nbsp;kusippar]ho nambun)}}) from the south mound of Tumulus No.&amp;nbsp;98, is a silver crown and was found near the head of the body in the coffin of the tomb.  The crown is currently housed in [[Gyeongju National Museum]].  The measurements of the crown are: 17.2&amp;nbsp;centimeters in height, 16.6&amp;nbsp;centimeters in diameter, the width of the headband is 3.2&amp;nbsp;centimeters.  The crown has three prongs but they are unique to any other kind of Silla crown discovered thus far.  The center prong is thick and shaped like a shield or a perhaps a shape bent like a bow with a high middle section.  There is a silver plate attached to this prong.  On either side of the center prong is a crescent-shaped prong.  The outer side of these crescent-shaped prongs are cut and twisted to make feather-like protrusions which are unique to Silla art.  However, there is an analogous example of this feather-like embellishment from a crown of Gaya providence found at the Uiseongtamni Tumulus.  The Eungwan crown was uncovered in Tumuli Park of Michu Royal Tomb in Gyeongju.  The mound is connected from the north and south and so has the shape of a gourd.  With a diameter of 80&amp;nbsp;meters from east to west and 120&amp;nbsp;meters from north to south, it is the largest mound of Silla.  The south mound is 23&amp;nbsp;meters in height, the north mound, which is where National Treasure No.&amp;nbsp;191 was uncovered, is 22&amp;nbsp;meters in height.

'''DaDaFest''' is a disability arts organisation based in Liverpool, UK. It delivers an international, biennial festival and organises other events to promote disability and deaf arts from a variety of cultural perspectives.&lt;ref name="DAonline_Review"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/dadafest2012-reviews |title= Review of DaDaFest 2012 |date= 1 September 2012 | website = disabilityartsonline.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts Online |accessdate= 12 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the festival and events, DaDaFest organises opportunities for disabled and deaf people to gain access to the arts.&lt;ref name="Arts_award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsaward.org.uk/site/?id=2430&amp;action=preview&amp;backTo=index |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304070725/http://www.artsaward.org.uk/site/?id=2430&amp;action=preview&amp;backTo=index |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 March 2016 |title= Arts Award Involvement |publisher=Arts Award |date= |accessdate= 12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes training and a youth focused programme.&lt;ref name="Young_DaDa"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dadafest.co.uk/initiatives-projects/research-projects/young-dada-steering-group/ |title= Young DaDa Steering Group | website = dadafest.co.uk | publisher = DaDaFest |accessdate= 12 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DaDaFest is funded by [[Arts Council England]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/browse-regularly-funded-organisations/npo/dada-disability-deaf-arts/ |title= Arts Council Funding DaDaFest | website = artscouncil.org.uk |publisher=Arts Council England |date= |accessdate=12 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Liverpool City Council]] as well as other private and public sector partners.

==History==
DaDaFest was founded as ''Arts Integrated Merseyside'' (or AIM) as a part of the [[Shape Arts]] network in 1984. AIM was integral to the early campaign for greater equality and access for disabled people, but was not disability led.&lt;ref name="Case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disabilityarts.creativecase.org.uk/creativecase-DaDa-Disability-and-Deaf-Arts |title= DaDaFest Case Study |date= | website = disabilityarts.creativecase.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts: Creative Case |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[John McGrath (artistic director)|John McGrath]] as its Development Officer,&lt;ref name="DA_online"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/chronology_disability_arts_1976_1989 |title= Disability Arts Chronology &amp;nbsp; 1976 - 1989: (1986) |date= 16 January 2009 | website = disabilityartsonline.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts Online |accessdate= 2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J_McGrath"&gt;{{cite web| title = Interview: Under the Skin with John McGrath | url = http://www.dadafest.co.uk/2017/01/interview-under-the-skin-with-john-mcgrath/ | website = dadafest.co.uk | publisher = DaDaFest | date = 23 January 2017 |accessdate= 2 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the organisation became one of the UK's first disability control-led arts forums after it broke away from the [[Shape Arts|Shape Network]] and set itself up as ''North West Disability Arts Forum'' (NWDAF) in 1986. It was formally constituted in 1990,&lt;ref name="Case" /&gt; with [[Mandy Colleran]] becoming its director.&lt;ref name="DA_online2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Bidder | first = Joe |title= Ruth Gould: Creative Force in Disability Arts |url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/profile_of_ruth_gould | website = disabilityartsonline.org.uk | publisher = Disability Arts Online |date= 8 May 2008 | accessdate= 6 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation eventually re-branded itself to 'DaDa - Disability and Deaf Arts' in 2008 and again to 'DaDaFest' in 2012.

==Festival==
DaDaFest delivered its first international festival in 2001 and continued to put on yearly festivals until 2010 when it became a biennial.

[[File:T&amp;M.jpg|thumb|Original manuscript of "Death and the Maiden"]]

"'''{{Lang|de|Der Tod und das Mädchen|italic=no}}'''" ({{IPA-de|deːɐ̯ ˈtoːt ʊnt das ˈmɛːtçən|lang}}, "Death and the Maiden"), {{D.}} 531; [[Opus number|Op.]] 7, No. 3, is a [[lied]] composed by [[Franz Schubert]] in February [[1817 in music|1817]]. It was published by Cappi {{Lang|de|und|italic=no}} [[Anton Diabelli|Diabelli]] in Vienna in November 1821. The text is derived from a poem written by German poet [[Matthias Claudius]]. The song is set for [[vocal music|voice]] and [[piano]].

==Composition==

The piece begins with an introduction in [[D minor]]; the first eight [[bar (music)|bars]] in the [[time signature]] 2/2. Both hands play [[Chord (music)|chords]]. The section is quiet ([[Dynamics (music)|pianissimo]]) and slow (''mäßig''), and presents the musical [[theme (music)|theme]] of [[Death (personification)|Death]].

The Maiden enters in the ninth bar on an [[anacrusis]]. This section is more agitated than the first; it is marked [[dynamics (music)|piano]] and "somewhat faster" (''etwas geschwinder''). The melody gradually increases in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[chromatic]]ally at points. The piano accompaniment is [[syncopated]], playing chords of [[quaver]]s alternating in the left and right hand. A [[diminished triad|diminished chord]] in the first bar of the third line (''ich bin noch jung'') creates an eerie mood. In the eighth bar of the maiden's song, on the word ''rühre'' ("touch"), the quavers stop and the rhythm of the opening section returns. Then an [[imperfect cadence]] leads to a [[rest (music)|rest]] with [[fermata]]. This brings the second section to a total of 13 bars in length.

The third and final section is Death's song.  The music returns to the [[tempo]] and [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] of the introduction. Death's melody has a narrow pitch range (save for the very last note where the singer has the option of dropping to D below the melody line). The [[key (music)|key]] [[Modulation (music)|modulates]] to [[F major]], the relative major of D minor. With the last syllable of Death's song, the key changes into [[D major]]. The coda is almost a repeat of the introduction, except it is shortened by one bar and is now in the [[major key]].

Vorüber! Ach, vorüber!
Geh, wilder Knochenmann!
Ich bin noch jung! Geh, Lieber,
Und rühre mich nicht an.
Und rühre mich nicht an.

''Der Tod'':
Gib deine Hand, du schön und zart Gebild!
Bin Freund, und komme nicht, zu strafen.
Sei gutes Muts! ich bin nicht wild,
Sollst sanft in meinen Armen schlafen!&lt;/poem&gt;

Go, fierce man of bones!
I am still young! Go, dear,

I am a friend, and come not to punish.
Be of good cheer! I am not fierce,

*The theme of the shadowy figure trying to touch a victim, and the victim fearing death at the figure's hands, is explored in some of Schubert's other works as well, notably in the [[lied]] ''Erlkönig'', which itself uses the text of the [[Der Erlkönig|poem by the same name]] by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].
*The play and film versions of ''[[Death and the Maiden (play)|Death and the Maiden]]'' take their titles from the song.

'''''{{Lang|de|Die Entführung aus dem Serail}}''''' (&lt;small&gt;German:&lt;/small&gt; [[Help:IPA/Standard German|[ˈdɪ ʔɛntˈfyːʁʊŋ aʊ̯s dem zɛˈʁaɪ̯l]]]) ([[Köchel catalogue|K. 384]]; '''''The Abduction from the Seraglio'''''; also known as '''''{{Lang|it|Il Seraglio}}''''') is an [[opera]] [[Singspiel]] in three acts by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. The German [[libretto]] is by [[Gottlieb Stephanie]], based on [[Christoph Friedrich Bretzner]]'s [[Belmont und Constanze|''Belmont und Constanze, oder Die Entführung aus dem Serail'']]. The plot concerns the attempt of the hero Belmonte, assisted by his servant Pedrillo, to rescue his beloved Konstanze from the [[seraglio]] of [[Pasha]] Selim. The work premiered on 16 July 1782 at the Vienna [[Burgtheater]], with the composer conducting.

==Origins==
The company that first sponsored the opera was the ''Nationalsingspiel'' ("national [[Singspiel]]"), a pet project (1778–1783) of the Austrian emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. The Emperor had set up the company to perform works in the German language (as opposed to the [[Italian opera]] style widely popular in Vienna). This project was ultimately given up as a failure, but along the way it produced a number of successes, mostly a series of translated works. Mozart's opera emerged as its outstanding original success.&lt;ref&gt;Manning 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

The inspector of the ''Nationalsingspiel'' was [[Gottlieb Stephanie]].&lt;ref name="abert"&gt;Abert 2007, 620&lt;/ref&gt; When the 25-year-old Mozart arrived in Vienna in 1781, seeking professional opportunity, one of the first tasks to which he addressed himself was to become acquainted with Stephanie and lobby him for an opera commission. To this end, he brought a copy of his earlier opera ''[[Zaide]]'' and showed it to Stephanie, who was duly impressed. Mozart also made a strong impression on the manager of the theater, Count [[Orsini-Rosenberg|Franz Xaver Orsini-Rosenberg]], when in the home of Mozart's friend and patroness [[Maria Wilhelmine von Thun und Hohenstein|Maria Wilhelmine Thun]] the Count heard him play excerpts from his opera ''[[Idomeneo]]'', premiered with great success the previous year in [[Munich]].&lt;ref name="abert" /&gt; With this backing, it was agreed that Stephanie would find appropriate material and prepare a libretto for Mozart. Stephanie complied by preparing an altered version of an earlier work [[Belmont und Constanze|''Belmont und Constanze, oder Die Entführung aus dem Serail'']] without attributing or seeking permission from its original author [[Christoph Friedrich Bretzner]]. Bretzner later complained loudly and publicly about the theft.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Mozart received the libretto from Stephanie on 29 July 1781. He had few opportunities to compose professionally during the summer and he set to work on the libretto at a very rapid pace, finishing three major numbers in just two days. A letter to his father [[Leopold Mozart|Leopold]] indicates he was very excited about the prospect of having his opera performed in Vienna, and worked enthusiastically on his project.

At first Mozart thought he needed to finish his opera in only two months, because tentative plans were made to perform it at the September visit of the Russian [[Paul I of Russia|Grand Duke Paul]] (son of [[Catherine the Great]] and heir to the Russian throne). However, it was ultimately decided to perform operas by [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] instead, giving Mozart more time.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens 1990, 61&lt;/ref&gt;

It was around this time that Mozart articulated his views about the role of the composer and the librettist in the preparation of an opera. He wrote to his father (13 October 1781):
{{quote|text=I would say that in an opera the poetry must be altogether the obedient daughter of the music. Why are Italian comic operas popular everywhere – in spite of the miserable libretti? … Because the music reigns supreme, and when one listens to it all else is forgotten. An opera is sure of success when the plot is well worked out, the words written solely for the music and not shoved in here and there to suit some miserable rhyme ... The best thing of all is when a good composer, who understands the stage and is talented enough to make sound suggestions, meets an able poet, that true phoenix;&lt;ref&gt;By this Mozart meant something exceedingly rare. The same metaphor is used in the first scene of Mozart's later opera ''[[Così fan tutte]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in that case, no fears need be entertained as to the applause – even of the ignorant.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 61–62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It would seem that something along these lines did happen—that is, Mozart decided to play a major role in the shaping of the libretto, insisting that Stephanie make changes for dramatic and musical effect. On 26 September Mozart wrote:
{{quote|text=Now comes the rub! The first act was finished more than three weeks ago, as was also one aria in act 2 and the drunken duet ["Vivat Bacchus", act 2] ... But I cannot compose any more, because the whole story is being altered – and, to tell the truth, at my own request. At the beginning of act 3 there is a charming quintet or rather finale, but I would prefer to have it at the end of act 2. In order to make this practicable, great changes must be made, in fact an entirely new plot must be introduced – and Stephanie is up to his neck in other work. So we must have a little patience.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 77–78&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mozart was evidently quite pleased to have in Stephanie a librettist who would listen to him. The September 26 letter also says:
{{quote|text=Everyone abuses Stephanie. It may be the case he is only friendly to my face. But after all he is preparing the libretto for me – and, what is more, exactly as I want it – and by Heaven, I don't ask anything more of him.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braunbehrens 1990, 62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the delays for rewriting, the composition took several more months. The premiere took place on 16 July [[1782 in music|1782]], at the [[Burgtheater]] in Vienna.

==Character==
''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' is in the genre of "Singspiel", thus the music lacks [[recitative]]s and consists entirely of set numbers. As Hughes notes, the action is mostly carried forward by the spoken dialogue, so the libretto gave Mozart little opportunity to display an achievement for which his later operas are celebrated, namely the construction of scenes in which the plot is both reflected in and driven forward by the music.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Spike (1972:20)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Die Entführung'' is lighthearted and frequently comic, with little of the deep character exploration or darker feelings found in Mozart's later operas.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Manning 1982&lt;/ref&gt; The opera was inspired by a contemporary interest in the exotic culture of the [[Ottoman Empire]], a nation which had only recently ceased to be a military threat to Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Braunbehrens (1990, 74). Braunbehrens suggests that "preparations had just begun to celebrate" the centennial of lifting of the Turkish [[Battle of Vienna|Siege of Vienna]] in 1683. Later in the decade, Austria was again at war with Turkey (see [[Austro–Turkish War (1787–1791)]]) but this was a war of aggression, not defense.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two contemporary works also showing the contemporary interest in matters Turkish were Giovanni Paolo Marana's ''[[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]'' and [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Persian Letters]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Mozart's opera includes a [[Turkish music (style)|Westernized version of Turkish music]], based very loosely on the Turkish [[Janissary Music|Janissary band music]].

Certain aspects of the opera conform to an eighteenth-century European view of [[orientalism]]. The Pasha's titular harem, for example, reprised themes of sexual libertinage. And the comically sinister overseer, Osmin, is a send-up of earlier stereotypes of Turkish despotism.&lt;ref&gt;Osterhammel (1998) notes: "Neben das alte Bild des dämonisierten Feindes trat in der künstlerischen Repräsentation nun der übertölpelte Buffo-Türke, wie man ihn als Haremswächter Osmin auf Mozarts ''Entführung aus dem Serail'' (1782) kennt." [Next to the older image of the demonised enemy stood the over-the-top Turkish Buffoon in cultural representation, such as the Harem overseer Osmin from Mozart's ''Abduction from the Seraglio''.] p.&amp;nbsp;34&lt;/ref&gt; However, the opera also defies the stereotype of despotic Turkish culture, since its climax entails a selfless act of forgiveness on the part of the Pasha.&lt;ref&gt;Others have suggested that the Pasha is portrayed positively for acting like a Christian. This argument is made in Matthew Head – ''Orientalism, Masquerade and Mozart's Turkish Music'',{{Full citation needed|date=November 2018}} and possibly implied by Mary Hunter who says that he is "represented as European by his act of mercy" (in "The ''Alla Turca'' Style" in [[Jonathan Bellman]] (ed) – ''The Exotic in Western Music''){{Full citation needed|date=November 2018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The music includes some of the composer's most spectacular and difficult arias. Osmin's act 3 aria "[[O, wie will ich triumphieren]]" includes characteristic 18th century [[coloratura]] passage work, and twice goes down to a low [[D (musical note)|D]] ([[Scientific pitch notation|D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), one of the lowest notes demanded of any voice in opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manitobaopera.mb.ca/learn/trivia.html|title=Learn About Opera|publisher=|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous aria in the opera is the long and elaborate "Martern aller Arten" ("Tortures of all kinds") for Konstanze, an outstanding challenge for sopranos. Konstanze sings in a kind of [[sinfonia concertante]] with four solo players from the orchestra; the strikingly long orchestral introduction, without stage action, also poses problems for stage directors.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion, see Rosen (1997, 165) and Eisen (2006, 164–165).&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtuosity of these roles is perhaps attributable to the fact that when he took up the task of composing the opera, Mozart already knew the outstanding reputations of the singers for whom he was writing, and he tailored the arias to their strengths.&lt;ref name="abert" /&gt; The first Osmin was [[Ludwig Fischer (bass)|Ludwig Fischer]], a bass noted for his wide range and skill in leaping over large intervals with ease. Similarly, Mozart wrote of the first Konstanze, [[Caterina Cavalieri]], "I have sacrificed Konstanze's aria a little to the flexible throat of Mlle. Cavalieri."

==Reception==
[[File:Entfuhrung aus dem Serail484.jpg|thumb|Mozart (at center) attended a performance of his own opera ''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' while [[Mozart's Berlin journey|visiting Berlin]] in 1789. Franz Frankenberg performed the role of Osmin, Friedrich Ernst Wilhelm Greibe played Pedrillo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Starší divadlo v českých zemích do konce 18. století|editor-last=Jakubcová|editor-first=Alena|authorlink= |year=2007|publisher=Divadelní ústav, Academia|location=Prague|isbn=978-80-200-1486-3|page=707|url= |language=cs}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] The opera was a huge success. The first two performances brought in the large sum of 1200 florins, three times what Mozart's salary had been for his old job in Salzburg.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965, 201&lt;/ref&gt; The work was repeatedly performed in Vienna during Mozart's lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;For a listing see Deutsch 1965, 201&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout German-speaking Europe.&lt;ref&gt;See the index entry for the opera in Deutsch 1965. The Stuttgart premiere had to wait until 19 September 1795, because the singspiel ''Belmont und Constanze'', set to the same story by Christian Ludwig Dieter (1757–1822), first performed there in 1784, was so popular as to preclude any performances of Mozart's version; ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed, 1954, [[Eric Blom]], ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1787, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] wrote (concerning his own efforts as a librettist):
{{quote|text=All our endeavour ... to confine ourselves to what is simple and limited was lost when Mozart appeared. ''Die Entführung aus dem Serail'' conquered all, and our own carefully written piece has never been so much as mentioned in theater circles.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Deutsch 1965, 305. The work of his own to which Goethe refers is his ''{{Lang|de|Scherz, List und Rache}}'' which was used for an opera {{ill|Scherz, List und Rache|de|lt=of the same title}} by [[Max Bruch]] in 1858.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the opera greatly raised Mozart's standing with the public as a composer, it did not make him rich: he was paid a flat fee of 100 Imperial ducats (about 450 florins) for his work, and made no profits from the many subsequent performances.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1965, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

The opera reached Paris in November 1801, when [[Frédéric Blasius]] conducted Ellmenreich's company in performances at the [[Théâtre de la Gaîté (boulevard du Temple)|Théâtre de la Gaîté]].&lt;ref&gt;Noiray, Michel. "Blasius [Blassius], (Matthieu-)Frédéric" in [[Stanley Sadie]], ed., ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'', 4 vols. (London: Macmillan, 1992), 1: 498&lt;/ref&gt;

This opera is firmly ensconced in the repertoire today. 

==="Too many notes"===
The complexity of Mozart's work noted by Goethe also plays a role in a well-known tale about the opera which appeared in the early (1798) biography of Mozart by [[Franz Xaver Niemetschek]]. In the version of the anecdote printed in ''[[John Bartlett (publisher)|Bartlett]]'s Book of Anecdotes'', a reference work, the story is told like this:

{{quote|text=The Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] commissioned the creation of ''The Abduction from the Seraglio'', but when he heard it, he complained to Mozart, "That is too fine for my ears – there are too many notes." Mozart replied, "There are just as many notes as there should be."&lt;ref&gt;Bernard and Fadiman (2000, 339)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The authenticity of this story is not accepted by all scholars.&lt;ref&gt;See Schmidt-Hensel, and references cited there.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the version given by the Bartlett reference (and many other places) includes a translation of the original German that is dubious. The original reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Cited text from: [http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/nc/ueber-uns/presse/detail/article/2006-10-16-362.html "... gewaltig viele Noten, lieber Mozart!". ''Die Mozart-Autographe der Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224154541/http://staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/nc/ueber-uns/presse/detail/article/2006-10-16-362.html |date=2010-12-24 }}, Exhibition notes, Berlin 2006, by Roland Dieter Schmidt-Hensel, State Library Berlin; [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation|Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Zu schön für unsere Ohren, und gewaltig viel Noten, lieber Mozart!}}

"Too many notes" is not a plausible translation of the German phrase "gewaltig viel Noten". Mautner (1956:33), translating Niemetschek, renders this as "an extraordinary number of notes", while Branscombe (2006) translates it simply as "very many notes".&lt;ref&gt;Branscombe (2006, 165)&lt;/ref&gt; The anecdote, which is often repeated, is considered by some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Beales (2006, 238–239)&lt;/ref&gt; to unfairly give the Emperor a bad reputation concerning both his own musical abilities and his appreciation and support of Mozart.

==Instrumentation==
The singers perform with a [[Classical period (music)|Classical-era]] [[orchestra]]: pairs of [[western concert flute|flute]]s (2nd doubling piccolo), [[oboe]]s, [[clarinet]]s, [[bassoon]]s, [[Natural horn|horn]]s, [[trumpet]]s, a set of two [[timpani]], and [[string section|strings]]. They are augmented with the instruments needed for [[Turkish music (style)|"Turkish" music]]: [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s, [[triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], and [[piccolo]]. The aria, "{{Lang|de|Traurigkeit ward mir zum Lose|italic=no}}", is augmented by a [[basset horn]].

The orchestra for the premiere included a number of eminent musicians of the day: first cellist [[Joseph Franz Weigl]], first oboist [[Josef Triebensee]], second horn [[Joseph Leutgeb]], and the clarinettist brothers [[Anton Stadler|Anton]] and [[Johann Stadler]]. In the first violin section was [[Josepha Weber|Franz de Paula Hofer]], who later became Mozart's brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Edge (1992:72–73)&lt;/ref&gt; The four musicians who played the "Turkish" instruments remain anonymous, though it is known that they were recruited for this purpose by one Franz Tyron, [[Kapellmeister]] of the Austrian Second Field Artillery Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;Edge (1992:75)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
:Place: the country house of the Pasha (German "Bassa"), in Turkey
:Time: 16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. F. Bretzner|editor1-last=Bloch|editor1-first=John W.|title=The Abduction from the Seraglio (libretto)|date=1962|publisher=[[G. Schirmer]]|location=New York|page=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act 1===
After a lively overture, Belmonte enters, looking for his betrothed, Konstanze, who with her English servant Blonde has fallen into the hands of pirates and been sold to [[Pasha]] Selim (Aria: "Hier soll ich dich denn sehen" – "Here surely I must find her").&lt;ref&gt;English titles from ''[http://www.chandos.net/Details06.asp?CNumber=CHAN%203081 The Abduction From the Seraglio]'', [[Chandos Records]] CHAN 3081 (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Osmin, the Pasha's bad-tempered servant, comes to pluck [[Common fig|fig]]s in the garden and contemptuously ignores Belmonte's questions (Aria: "Wer ein Liebchen hat gefunden" – "You may think, you've found a maiden"). Belmonte tries to obtain news of his servant, Pedrillo, who has been captured with the women and is serving as a servant in the Pasha's palace. Osmin replies with insults and abuse (Duet: "Verwünscht seist du samt deinem Liede!" – "The devil take you and your song, sir"). Belmonte leaves in disgust. Pedrillo enters and Osmin rages at him, vowing to get him tortured and killed in many different ways (Aria: "Solche hergelaufne Laffen" – "These young men who go a-spying"). Osmin leaves and Belmonte enters and happily reunites with Pedrillo. Together they resolve to rescue Konstanze and Blonde, who is Pedrillo's fiancée (Aria: "Konstanze, Konstanze, dich wiederzusehen … O wie ängstlich" – "Konstanze, Konstanze, to see thee again … Oh what trembling").

Accompanied by a chorus of [[Janissaries]] ("Singt dem großen Bassa Lieder" – "Sing to the mighty Pasha Selim"), Pasha Selim appears with Konstanze, for whose love he strives in vain (Aria of Konstanze: "Ach ich liebte" – "How I loved him"). Pedrillo tricks the Pasha into hiring Belmonte as an architect. When Belmonte and Pedrillo try to enter the palace, Osmin bars their way, but they hurry past him anyway (Terzett: "Marsch! Marsch! Marsch! Trollt euch fort!" – "March! March! March! Clear off!").

===Act 2===
[[File:John frederick lewis-reception1873.jpg|thumb|An illustration of the women's quarters in a [[seraglio]], [[John Frederick Lewis]], 1873]]
The Pasha has given Blonde to Osmin, to be his slave; however, she defiantly rebuffs her new master's rough lovemaking attempts (Aria: "Durch Zärtlichkeit und Schmeicheln" – "With smiles and kind caresses"), threatens to scratch out his eyes, and chases him out of the room (Duet: "Ich gehe, doch rate ich dir" – "I'm going, but mark what I say"). Konstanze enters and greets Blonde in distress (Aria: "Welcher Wechsel herrscht in meiner Seele … Traurigkeit ward mir zum Lose" – "Oh what sorrow overwhelms my spirit … Endless grief tortures my spirit"). The Pasha enters, demands her love, and threatens to use force, but she resolutely rejects him. (Aria: "Martern aller Arten" – "Tortures unrelenting")  Left alone, he muses on her determination to remain chaste, which increases his desire for her.

Pedrillo informs Blonde that Belmonte has come and is planning to rescue them. Blonde is filled with joy. (Aria: "Welche Wonne, welche Lust" – "Oh, the happy, happy day"). After singing a short ditty to boost his courage (Aria: "Frisch zum Kampfe" – "Now Pedrillo, now for battle!"), Pedrillo invites Osmin to drink (Duet: "Vivat [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]! Bacchus lebe!" – "Here's to Bacchus, long live Bacchus").  Despite his [[Khamr|religious prohibition against alcoholic beverages]], Osmin drinks heavily and falls asleep.  Konstanze joins Belmonte who declares his love (Aria: "Wenn der Freude Tränen fließen" – "When tears of joy flow"). The two couples reunite (Quartet, Belmonte, Konstanze, Pedrillo, Blonde: "Ach Belmonte! Ach, mein Leben" – "Ah, Belmonte, ah my dear one!"). After their initial expressions of love and joy, Belmonte and Pedrillo both question anxiously whether their respective fiancees have remained faithful during their forced separation; to their delight the women respond with indignation and dismay, and Blonde slaps Pedrillo's face. The two men apologize for their failure of confidence; the women forgive them for the offensive questions.

===Act 3===
Belmonte and Pedrillo come to the garden with ladders (Aria, Belmonte: "Ich baue ganz auf deine Stärke" – "Love, only love, can now direct me").  Pedrillo gets the attention of the women by singing a ballad about a rescue similar to the one he is planning (Romanze, Pedrillo: "In Mohrenland gefangen war" – "In Moorish lands a maiden fair"). However, Osmin enters, sees the ladders, and rouses the castle.  Osmin exults in the prospect of seeing them all hanged (Aria: "[[O, wie will ich triumphieren]]" – "My triumphant hour's approaching"). Belmonte pleads for their lives and tells Pasha Selim that his father is a Spanish [[Grandee]] and Governor of [[Oran]], named Lostados, and will pay a generous ransom. Unfortunately, Pasha Selim and Lostados are long-standing enemies. The Pasha rejoices in the opportunity to subject his enemy's son to a horrible death. He leaves Belmonte and Konstanze to bid each other a last farewell; they lovingly assure each other that being tortured to death will be a pleasure, so long as they get tortured to death together (Duet: "Welch ein Geschick! O Qual der Seele.... Weh, du soltest für mich sterben" – "What dreadful fate conspires against us.... Woe, you will die because of me"). However, the Pasha decides that he can make a better point against Lostados by showing mercy and releasing Belmonte and his friends. All are set at liberty – much to the dismay of Osmin, who would prefer to see them all brutally executed (Finale: "Nie werd' ich deine Huld verkennen" – "Your noble mercy passes measure").

==Adaptations==
The Finnish composer [[Aulis Sallinen]] wrote an opera called ''[[Palatsi (opera)|The Palace]]'' (first performed 1995); it contains characters whose names are adapted from ''Abduction'' and loosely uses elements of the plot of Mozart's opera as the starting point of a satirical fantasy.

Music professor, composer, and humorist [[Peter Schickele]] claims to have "discovered" [[P. D. Q. Bach]]'s ''[[The Abduction of Figaro]]'', a [[pastiche]] of the ''Entführung'' and Mozart's ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''.

A '''drum kit''' — also called a '''drum set''', '''trap set''' (a term using a contraction of the word, “contraption”), or simply '''drums''' — is a collection of [[drum]]s and other [[percussion instrument]]s, typically [[cymbal]]s, which are set up on stands to be played by a single player,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textd/drumkit.html |title=OnMusic Dictionary |publisher=Music.vt.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928052504/http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textd/Drumkit.html |archivedate=28 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[drum stick|drumsticks]] held in both hands, and the feet operating pedals that control the [[hi-hat cymbal]] and the beater for the [[bass drum]]. A drum kit consists of a mix of [[drum]]s (categorized [[classical music|classically]] as [[membranophones]], [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] high-level classification 2) and [[idiophones]] – most significantly [[cymbal]]s, but can also include the [[woodblock (instrument)|woodblock]] and [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] (classified as Hornbostel-Sachs high-level classification 1).&lt;ref&gt;Remnant, M. (1989). Musical instruments. (pp. 159–174). London: B.T. Batsford Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000s, some kits also include [[electronic instrument]]s (Hornbostel-Sachs classification 53). Also, both hybrid (mixing acoustic instruments and [[electronic drum]]s) and entirely electronic kits are used.

A standard modern kit (for a right-handed player), as used in [[popular music]] and taught in music schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elephantdrums.co.uk |title=Elephant Drums |publisher=elephantdrums.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710154120/http://www.elephantdrums.co.uk/ |archivedate=10 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trinitycollege.co.uk/site/?id=1794 |title=Trinity College London &amp;#124; Home |publisher=Trinitycollege.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521215945/http://www.trinitycollege.co.uk/site/?id=1794 |archivedate=21 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- You may wish to consult the talk page, particularly the section "Is there a standard kit", before removing the reference to Trinity College, and put your reasons for doing so there. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mgrmusic.com/drum-lessons/ |title=MGR Music Tuition |publisher=mgrmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911134443/http://mgrmusic.com/ |archivedate=10 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; contains:

* A [[snare drum]], mounted on a [[snare drum stand|stand]], placed between the player's knees and played with [[drum stick]]s (which may include [[rute (music)|rute]]s or [[brushes (percussion)|brushes]]) 
* A [[bass drum]], played by a [[bass drum pedal|pedal]] operated by the right foot, which moves a felt-covered beater
* One or more [[tom drum|tom]]s, played with sticks or brushes (usually three toms: rack tom 1 and 2, and floor tom)
* A [[hi-hat]] (two cymbals mounted on a stand), played with the sticks, opened and closed with left foot pedal (it can also produce sound with the foot alone)
* One or more [[cymbal]]s, mounted on stands, played with the sticks

All of these are classified as [[non-pitched percussion]], allowing for the music to be [[sheet music|scored]] using [[percussion notation]], for which a loose semi-standardized form exists for both the drum kit and [[electronic drum]]s. The drum kit is usually played while seated on a stool known as a [[drum stool| throne]]. While many instruments like the [[guitar]] or [[piano]] are capable of performing melodies and chords, most drum kits are unable to achieve this as they produce sounds of [[indeterminate pitch]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Magadini "The Drummers Guide to Music theory", 2004, published by Hal Leonard, on the 'Elements of Music' &amp; 'Form'pp.&amp;nbsp;6–18;48–52&lt;/ref&gt; The drum kit is a part of the standard [[rhythm section]], used in many types of [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]] styles, ranging from [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] to [[blues]] and [[jazz]]. Other standard instruments used in the rhythm section include the piano, [[electric guitar]], [[electric bass]], and [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]].

Many drummers [[#Extended kits|extend]] their kits from this basic configuration, adding more drums, more cymbals, and many other instruments including [[pitched percussion]]. In some styles of music, particular extensions are normal. For example, rock and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal drummers]] make use of [[Bass drum#Double bass drum|double bass drums]], which can be achieved with either a second bass drum or a remote double foot pedal.&lt;ref name="Double bass drum"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nyman |first1=John |title=HomeFeatures   Double Bass Legends: A Short History |url=http://drummagazine.com/double-bass-legends-a-short-history/ |website=Drum! |accessdate=October 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[progressive rock|progressive]] drummers may include orchestral percussion such as [[tam tam|gong]]s and [[tubular bells]] in their rig. Some performers, such as some [[rockabilly]] drummers, play [[#Small kits|small kits]] that omit elements from the basic setup. Some drum kit players may have other roles in the band, such as providing [[backup vocals]], or less commonly, [[lead vocals]].

==History==
===Early development===
Prior to the development of the drum set, drums and cymbals used in military and orchestral music settings were played separately by different percussionists; if the score called for bass drum, triangle and cymbals, three percussionists would be hired to play these three instruments. In the 1840s, percussionists began to experiment with foot pedals as a way to enable them to play more than one instrument, but these devices would not be mass-produced for another 75 years. By the 1860s, percussionists started combining multiple drums into a set. The [[bass drum]], [[snare drum]], [[cymbals]], and other [[percussion instruments]] were all struck with hand-held [[drum stick]]s. Drummers in [[musical theatre|musical theater]] shows and stage shows, where the budget for [[pit orchestra]]s was often limited, contributed to the creation of the drum set by developing techniques and devices that would enable them to cover the roles of multiple percussionists.

[[Double-drumming]] was developed to enable one person to play the bass and snare with sticks, while the cymbals could be played by tapping the foot on a "low-boy". With this approach, the bass drum was usually played on beats one and three (in 4/4 time). While the music was first designed to accompany marching soldiers, this simple and straightforward drumming approach eventually led to the birth of [[ragtime]] music when the simplistic marching beats became more syncopated. This resulted in a greater [[Swing music|'swing']] and dance feel. The drum set was initially referred to as a "trap set", and from the late 1800s to the 1930s, drummers were referred to as "trap drummers".  By the 1870s, drummers were using an "overhang pedal". Most drummers in the 1870s preferred to do double drumming without any pedal to play multiple drums, rather than use an overhang pedal. Companies patented their pedal systems such as Dee Dee Chandler of New Orleans 1904–05.&lt;ref&gt;Porter/Hull man/Hazel (1993).  ''Jazz – From its Origins to the Present'', p.18. {{ISBN|0-13-512195-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberating the hands for the first time, this evolution saw the bass drum played with the foot of a standing percussionist (thus the term "kick drum"). The bass drum became the central piece around which every other percussion instrument would later revolve.

William F. Ludwig, Sr., and his brother, Theobald Ludwig, founded the Ludwig &amp; Ludwig Co. in 1909 and patented the first commercially successful [[bass drum pedal]] system, paving the way for the modern drum kit.&lt;ref name="DRUMHISTORY"/&gt; It was the golden age of drum building for many famous drum companies, with Ludwig introducing... "The ornately engraved" Black Beauty Brass Snare drum; Slingerland premiered its Radio King solid-maple shell; Leedy invented the floating drum head &amp; self-aligning lug;&amp; Gretsch originated the three-way tension system of the Gladstone snare drum".&lt;ref&gt;(Latter quote from pages 5–6 of Jon Cohan's "Star Sets- Drum Kits of the Great Drummers", with a foreword by Bill Bruford).&lt;/ref&gt; Wire brushes for use with drums and cymbals were introduced in 1912. The need for brushes arose due to the problem of the drum sound overshadowing the other instruments on stage. Drummers began using metal fly swatters to reduce the volume on stage next to the other acoustic instruments. Drummers could still play the rudimentary snare figures and grooves with brushes that they would normally play with drumsticks.

===20th century===
[[File:Dance band drummer at Mark Foy's Empress Ballroom from The Powerhouse Museum.jpg|thumb|200px|Dance band drummer Stan Farmer in 1935 at Mark Foy's Empress Ballroom in Sydney, New South Wales, using a kit with bass drum pedal and a "low sock"]]

By World War I, drum kits were often marching band-style military bass drums with many percussion items suspended on and around them. Drum kits became a central part of [[jazz]] music, especially [[Dixieland]]. The modern drum kit was developed in the [[Vaudeville]] era during the 1920s in New Orleans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buford|first=Jon Cohan ; foreword by Bill|title=Star sets : drum kits of the great drummers|year=1995|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee, WI|ISBN=0-7935-3489-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, a New Orleans band called "The Original Dixieland Jazz Band " recorded jazz tunes that became hits all over the country. These were the first official jazz recordings. Drummers such as Baby Dodds, [[Zutty Singleton|"Zutty" Singleton]] and [[Ray Bauduc]] had taken the idea of marching rhythms, combining the bass drum and snare drum and  "traps", a term used to refer to the percussion instruments associated with immigrant groups, which included miniature cymbals, tom toms, cowbells and woodblocks. They started incorporating these elements with [[ragtime]], which had been popular for a couple of decades, creating an approach which evolved into a jazz drumming style.

Budget constraints and space considerations in [[musical theatre]] [[pit orchestra]]s led bandleaders to pressure fewer percussionists to cover more percussion parts. Metal consoles were developed to hold Chinese [[tom-toms]], with swing-out stands for [[snare drum]]s and [[cymbal]]s. On top of the console was a "contraption" tray (shortened to "trap"), used to hold items like [[whistle]]s, [[klaxon]]s, and [[Cowbell (instrument)|cowbells]], so these drums/kits were dubbed "trap kits". [[Hi-hat (instrument)|Hi-hat]] stands became available around 1926.&lt;ref name="DRUMHISTORY"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Drum Book: The History of the Rock Drum Kit |first=Geoff |last=Nichols |year=1997 |location=London |publisher=Balafon Books |pages=8–12 |isbn=0879304766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 [[Baby Dodds]] (Warren "Baby" Dodds, circa 1898–1959), playing on riverboats with [[Louis Armstrong]] on the Mississippi, was modifying the military marching set-up and experimenting with playing the drum rims instead of woodblocks, hitting cymbals with sticks (1919), which was not yet common, and adding a side cymbal above the bass drum, what became known as the ride cymbal. Drum maker William Ludwig developed the "sock" or early low-mounted high-hat after observing Dodd's drumming. Ludwig noticed that Dodd tapped his left foot all the time.  Dodds had Ludwig raise the newly produced low hats 9 inches higher to make it easier to play, thus creating the modern hi-hat cymbal.&lt;ref&gt;Information on Dodds is found in his own contemporary journals/biography  "The Baby Dodds Story" -Louisiana State University Press, 1992, and by contemporary witness- drummer Gearge Wettling, who confirms Dodds was the first drummer to also keep the now-famous broken-triplet beat that became the standard pulse/roll of what we call ride cymbal playing.&lt;/ref&gt; Dodds was one of the first drummers to also play the broken-triplet beat that became the standard pulse and roll of modern ride cymbal playing. Dodds also popularized the use of Chinese cymbals.&lt;ref&gt;pages 8–9, Jon Cohan's- "Star Sets"- Wording, see page nine; paragraphs 1–4. Further:  see the Percussive Arts Society, 'Hall of Fame' Article, by Rick Mattingly].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, US Congress passed a [[prohibition]] law outlawing the manufacturing and transporting of drinking alcohol. When drinking became illegal, it became popular in underground nightclubs. The type of music that was played at these underground establishments that were selling alcohol was jazz. It was not seen as upstanding to listen to or perform jazz music, because it was an [[African American]] style and at that time the United States was segregated and racism was an overtly prevalent issue. Because jazz music was seen as great dance music, [[big band]] jazz became popular in nightclubs. In the 1920s, freelance drummers emerged. They were hired to play shows, concerts, theaters, clubs and back dancers and artists of various genres. Just as modern drummers have many different roles, so did the drummers of the 1920s. One important role for drummers in the 1920s is what is referred to in modern times as a [[foley artist]]. During [[silent film]]s, an orchestra was hired to accompany the silent film and the drummer was responsible for providing all the sound effects. Drummers played instruments to imitate gun shots, planes flying overhead, a train coming into a train station, and galloping horses etc.

Sheet music from the 1920s provides evidence that the drummer's sets were starting to evolve in size and sound to support the various acts mentioned above. However, the first "talkies" or films with audio, were released circa 1927 and by 1930 most films were released with a soundtrack and the silent film era was over. The downside of the technological breakthrough was that thousands of drummers who served as sound effect specialists were put out of work overnight. A similar panic was felt by drummers in the 1980s, when electronic [[drum machine]]s were first released.

===Big Band drumming===
[[File:Gene Krupa crop.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Gene Krupa]] was the first jazz drummer to lead his own big band (1946)]]
[[File:Louis Bellson.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Louis Bellson]] with the Duke Ellington Orchestra at the Palomar Supper Club. Vancouver, B.C., 19 April 1952]]

In 1929, when the stock market crash resulted in a global depression, one of the things that helped people cope with the trying years was swing jazz music. By the early to mid 1930's, [[big band]] [[Swing music|swing]] was being embraced throughout the US, becoming the country's most popular form of music. The other contributing factor to the big band's success during the 1930s was the popularity of radio. The drum kit played a key role in the big band swing sound. Throughout the 1930s [[Chick Webb]] and [[Gene Krupa]] at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem, increased the  visual and musical driving force of the drummer and their equipment by simply being so popular and in demand- and  they ensured that their  drum kits became not only functionally developed but dazzling and well designed.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cohan page 13&lt;/ref&gt; Jazz drummers were influential in developing  the concept of the modern drum kit and extending playing techniques. [[Gene Krupa]] was the first drummer to head his own orchestra and thrust the drums into the  spotlight with his drum solos.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Others would soon follow his lead.

As the music of the world was evolving, so was the drum set. Tom-tom drums, small crash cymbals, Chinese cymbals and hi-hat cymbals were added to the drum set. The hi-hats were the primary way for the drummers of the big band era to keep time. Before 1930, while playing the New Orleans jazz and Chicago styles, drummers would choke the cymbals on the "ands" of eighth note figures as an alternative to playing a buzz roll, the rim of the drums, or on the woodblocks to keep time. This muting method of keeping time by choking the crash and china cymbals proved to be awkward, so the drummers of that time came up with the idea of having a foot-operated cymbal. This resulted in the creation of the snowshoe cymbal, a foot-operated cymbal. It enabled drummers to play the eighth note figures between the right and left foot, improving the ergonomics and facility of drumset playing and helping drummers to keep a more steady rhythm.

Toward the end of the 1920s, variations of the hi-hats were introduced. One of the most popular hand held hi-hat cymbal variations used was called the "hand sock cymbals". The reason for the name "hi-hat" was because earlier versions of the hi-hat were referred to as a "low boy". The evolution that became the "hi-hats" allowed drummers to play the two cymbals with drum sticks while simultaneously controlling how open or closed the two cymbals were with their foot. The pedal could also be used to play the cymbals with the foot alone, while the right hand played other drums. By the 1930s, [[Ben Duncan]] and others popularized streamlined trap kits leading to a basic [[#Four piece with floor tom|four piece]] drum set standard: [[Bass drum|bass]], snare, tom-tom, and a larger [[floor tom]]. In time, legs were fitted to larger floor toms, and "consolettes" were devised to hold smaller tom-toms (ride toms) on the bass drum.

===Bebop drumming===
In the early 1940s, many jazz musicians, especially African American jazz musicians, started to stray from the popular big band dance music of the 1930s. Their experimentation and quest for deeper expression and freedom on the instrument led to the birth of a new style of music based from Harlem called [[bebop]] music. Whereas swing was a popular music designed for dancing, bebop was a "musician's music" designed for listening. During the bebop era, given that bands no longer had to accompany dancers, [[bandleader]]s could speed up the tempo. Bebop was also much more based on improvisation, in comparison to the heavily [[Arranging|arranged]] big band scores.  Bebop musicians would take an old standard and re-write the melody, add more complex chord changes, resulting in a new composition.

Swing drummers such as [[Max Roach]] and [[Kenny Clarke]] had already deviated from the large marching band-style bass drums, finding that they were too loud and boomy. Bebop drummers continued this trend, and they started trying out smaller bass drum sizes in the drum set. Bebop drummers' experimentations with new drum sizes and new sounds led to the innovative concept of applying the busy "four on the floor" bass drum rhythms to a new larger cymbal called the ride cymbal. By focusing on keeping time on the new ride cymbal instead of the bass drum, the "feel" went from bass drum and hi-hat heavy, to a lighter melodic feel that has been explained as "floating on top of the time". This allowed drummers to express themselves in a more melodic fashion by playing the rhythms used by the guitar, piano and sax players using the new smaller, more focused bass drums and snare. [[Louie Bellson]] also assisted in the innovative sizes and sounds of the 1940s drum set by pioneering the use of two bass drums, or the double bass drum kit.

===Rock drumming===
[[File:John Bonham 1975.jpg|thumb|200px|[[John Bonham]] of [[Led Zeppelin]], New York City, 1973]]
With [[rock and roll]] coming into place, a watershed moment occurred between 1962 and 1964 when the [[Surfaris]] released "Wipe Out", as well as when [[Ringo Starr]] of [[The Beatles]] played his [[Ludwig-Musser|Ludwig]] kit on American television. As rock moved from the [[nightclub]]s and bars and into stadiums in the 1960s, there was a trend towards bigger drum kits. The trend towards larger drum kits took momentum in the 1970s with the emergence of [[progressive rock]]. By the 1980s, widely popular drummers like [[Billy Cobham]], [[Carl Palmer]], [[Nicko McBrain]], [[Phil Collins]], [[Stewart Copeland]], [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] and [[Neil Peart]] were using large numbers of drums and cymbals. In the 1980s, some drummers began to use [[electronic drums]].

In the 2010s, some drummers use a variety of auxiliary percussion instruments, found objects, and electronics as part of their "drum" kits. Popular electronics include: electronic sound modules; laptop computers used to activate [[Loop (music)|loops]], [[Music sequencer|sequences]] and [[Sampling (music)|samples]]; [[metronome]]s and tempo meters; recording devices; and personal sound reinforcement equipment (e.g., a small [[PA system]] to amplify electronic drums and provide a monitor).

===Recording===
On early recording media (until 1925&lt;ref name="Hazel 1993 p.44"&gt;Porter/Hullman/Hazel (1993).  ''Jazz – From its Origins to the Present'', p.44. {{ISBN|0-13-512195-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) such as [[wax cylinder]]s and [[Gramophone record|disc]]s carved with an engraving needle, sound balancing meant that musicians had to be literally moved in the room.&lt;ref name="Hazel 1993 p.44"/&gt; Drums were often put far from the horn (part of the mechanical transducer) to reduce sound [[distortion]]. Since this affected the rendition of cymbals at playback, [[sound engineer]]s of the time remedied the situation by asking drummers to play the content of the cymbals onto [[woodblocks]], [[temple blocks]], and cowbells for their loudness and short decay.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Components==

===Terminology===

====Breakables, shells, extensions, hardware====
[[File:WTB Hihats Snares.jpg|thumb|Foreground: Snare drums. Midground: Hi-hat cymbals. Background: Ride/Crash cymbals]]
The drum kit may be loosely divided into four parts:
{{anchor|Breakables}}&lt;!--''Breakables'' redirects to this anchor--&gt;
* '''Breakables''': Sticks, various cymbals, snare drum, throne (stool) and sometimes the bass drum pedal.
* '''Shells''': Bass drum and toms.
* '''Extensions''': Cowbell, tambourine, chimes, any other instrument not part of the standard kit.
* '''Hardware''': Cymbal stands, drum stands, pedals.

There are several reasons for this division. When more than one band plays in a single performance, the drum kit is often considered part of the [[backline (stage)|backline]] (the key [[rhythm section]] equipment that stays on stage all night, which often also includes [[bass amp]]s and a [[stage piano]]), and is shared between/among the drummers. Oftentimes, the main "headlining" act will provide the drums, as they are being paid more, possibly have the better gear, and in any case have the prerogative of using their own. Sticks, snare drum and cymbals, and sometimes other components, are commonly swapped though, each drummer bringing their own. The term ''breakables'' in this context refers to whatever basic components the "guest" drummer is expected to bring. Similar considerations apply if using a "house kit" (a drum kit owned by the venue, which is rare), even if there is only one band at the performance.

The snare drum and cymbals are the core of the ''breakables'', as they are particularly critical and individual components of the standard kit, in several related ways.
* Their tone varies a great deal from drummer to drummer, reflecting their individual styles and the styles of music they play. As such, even drummers from the same genre of music may prefer a different brand or size of snare.
* The snare drum often does not match the kit, for example being a metal or plain wood shell in a kit where the other drums are in a matching finish.
* Drummers tend to spend more time playing the snare and cymbals than the other drums.
* Thin or bell-metal cymbals are easily broken by poor technique.
* Many drummers use thinner heads on their snare than the other drums.
* Often, a drummer will retain their snare drum and cymbals when upgrading the rest of the kit, or upgrade cymbals or snare while keeping the other drums.

Much the same considerations apply to bass drum pedals and the stool, but these are not always considered ''breakables'', particularly if changeover time between bands is very limited. Swapping the snare drum in a standard kit can be done very quickly. Replacing cymbals on stands takes longer, particularly if there are many of them, and cymbals are easily damaged by incorrect mounting, so many drummers prefer to bring their own cymbal stands.

====Drum sizes====
See [[#Common configurations|Common configurations]] below for typical drum sizes.

Traditionally, in America and the United Kingdom, drum sizes were expressed as ''depth x diameter'', both in [[inch]]es, but many drum kit manufacturers have since begun to express their sizes in terms of ''diameter x depth''; still in the measure of inches.

Manufacturers using the American traditional format in their catalogs include these:
* [[ddrum]]
* [[Drum Workshop]]
* [[Gretsch Drums]]
* [[Ludwig-Musser]]
* [[Slingerland Drum Company]]
* [[Tama Drums]]
* [[Seb Custom Drums]]
Those using the European measures of diameter x depth include these:

For example, a [[hanging tom]] 12 inches in diameter and 8 inches deep would be described by Tama as 8 inches × 12 inches, but by Pearl as 12 inches × 8 inches, and a standard diameter Ludwig [[snare drum]] 5 inches deep is a 5-inch × 14-inch, while the UK's Premier Manufacturer offers the same dimensions as: a 14-inch × 5-inch snare.

===Drums===

====Snare drum====
[[File:2006-07-06 snare 14.jpg|thumb|Snare drum on a modern light-duty snare drum stand]]
{{main|snare drum}}
The snare drum is the heart of the drum kit, particularly in rock, due its utility of providing the [[backbeat]]. When applied in this fashion, it supplies strong regular accents, played by the left hand (if right handed), and the backbone for many [[drum fill|fills]]. Its distinctive sound can be attributed to the bed of stiff snare wires held under tension to the underside of the lower drum head. When the stiff wire are "engaged" (held under tension), they vibrate with the top (snare-side) drum skin (head), creating a snappy, staccato buzzing sound, along with the sound of the stick striking the batter head.

====Toms====
[[File:Keith Moon 4 - The Who - 1975.jpg|left|thumb|270px|[[Keith Moon]] of [[The Who]] with a mixture of [[concert tom]]s and conventional toms, 1975]] 
{{main|tom-tom drum}}
Tom-tom drums, or ''toms'' for short, are drums without snares and played with sticks (or whatever tools the music style requires), and are the most numerous drums in most kits. They provide the bulk of most drum fills and solos.

They include:
* Traditional [[Cannon depth|double-headed rack toms]], of varying depths
* [[Floor tom]]s (generally the widest and largest toms, which also makes them the lowest-pitched toms)
* Single-headed [[concert tom]]s
* [[Rototoms]]

The smallest and largest drums without snares, [[octobans]] and [[gong drum]]s respectively, are sometimes considered toms. The naming of [[#Common configurations|common configurations]] (four-piece, five-piece, etc.) is largely a reflection of the number of toms, as only the drums are conventionally counted, and these configurations all contain one snare and one or more bass drums, (though not regularly any standardized use of 2 bass/kick drums) the balance usually being in toms.

{{clear}}

====Bass drum====
[[File:Bass drum.jpg|thumb|250px|A drum kit bass drum]]
[[File:ImprovisedDrumLondon.jpg|thumb|Improvised [[bass drum]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]].]]
{{main|bass drum}}
The bass drum (also known as the "kick drum") provides a regular but often-varied foundation to the rhythm. The bass drum is the lowest pitched drum and usually provides the basic beat or timing element with basic pulse patterns. Some drummers may use [[double bass drumming|two or more bass drums]] or use a double bass drum pedal with a single bass drum. Double bass drumming is an important technique in many [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genres. Using a double bass drum pedal enables a drummer to play a double bass drum style with only one bass drum, saving space in recording/performance areas and reducing time and effort during set-up, taking down, and transportation.

====Other drums====
[[Octobans]] are smaller toms designed for use in a drum kit, extending the tom range upwards in pitch, primarily by their depth; as well as diameter (typically 6"). Pearl brand octobans are called "rocket toms"; the instruments are also called [[File:Anders Johansson 2.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Anders Johansson (drummer)|Anders Johansson]] with an array of Octobans]]

[[Timbales]] are tuned much higher than a tom of the same diameter, and normally played with very light, thin, non-tapered sticks. They have relatively thin heads and a very different tone than a tom, but are used by some drummers/percussionists to extend the tom range upwards. Alternatively, they can be fitted with tom heads and tuned as shallow concert toms. [[Attack timbales]] and [[mini timbales]] are reduced-diameter timbales designed for drum kit usage, the smaller diameter allowing for thicker heads providing the same pitch and head tension. They are recognizable in 2010s genres and in more traditional forms of Latin, reggae &amp; numerous world music styles. Timbales were also used on occasion by [[Led Zeppelin]] drummer [[John Bonham]]. Gong drums are a rare extension to a drum kit. The single-headed mountable drum appears similar to a bass drum (sizing around 20–24 inches in diameter), but has the same purpose as that of a floor tom.
Similarly, most [[hand drum]] percussion cannot be played easily or suitably with drum sticks without risking damage to the head and to the bearing edge, which is not protected by a metal drum rim, like a snare or tom. For use in a drum kit, they may be fitted with a metal drum head and played with care, or played by hand.

===Cymbals===
[[File:Portnoy 2327834448 d06703c5cd o.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mike Portnoy]], the ex drummer of [[Dream Theater]] with many cymbals. Rio de Janeiro, 7 March 2008]]
In most drum kits and drum/percussion kits cymbals are as important as the drums themselves. The oldest idiophones in music are cymbals, and were used throughout the ancient Near East, very early in the Bronze Age period. Cymbals are most associated with Turkey and Turkish craftsmanship, where Zildjian (the name means cymbal smith) has predominantly made them since 1623.&lt;ref&gt;Remnant, M. (1989). Musical instruments. (pp. 159–174). London: B.T. Batsford Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginners [[cymbal pack]]s normally contain four cymbals: one ride, one crash, and a pair of hi-hats. A few contain only three cymbals, using a [[crash/ride]] instead of the separate ride and crash. The sizes closely follow those given in [[#Common configurations|Common configurations]] below.

Most drummers soon extend this by adding another crash, a splash, a china/effects cymbal; or even all of those last mentioned.

====Ride cymbal====
{{main| Ride cymbal}}
The ride cymbal is most often used for keeping a constant-rhythm pattern, every beat or more often, as the music requires. Development of this ride technique is generally credited to [[Baby Dodds]].&lt;ref name="pas"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pas.org/experience/halloffame/DoddsWarren.aspx | title=Warren 'Baby' Dodds | publisher=The Percussive Arts Society | accessdate=21 November 2011 | quote=Dodds' way of playing press rolls ultimately evolved into the standard jazz ride-cymbal pattern. Whereas many drummers would play very short press rolls on the backbeats, Dodds would start his rolls on the backbeats but extend each one to the following beat, providing a smoother time flow. | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927104938/http://www.pas.org/experience/halloffame/DoddsWarren.aspx | archivedate=27 September 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most drummers have a single main ride, located near their right hand—within easy playing reach, as it is used very regularly—most often a 20"  sizing but, 16"-24"  diameters are not uncommon. It is most often a heavy, or medium-weighted cymbal that cuts through other instrumental sounds, but some drummers use a [[swish cymbal]], [[sizzle cymbal]] or other exotic or lighter metal ride, as the main or only ride in their kit, particularly for jazz, gospel or ballad/folk sounds. In the 1960s [[Ringo Starr]] used a sizzle cymbal as a second ride, particularly during guitar solos.

====Hi-hats====
{{main|Hi-hat (instrument)}}
The hi-hat cymbals (nicknamed "hats") consist of two cymbals mounted facing each other on a metal pole with folding support legs that keep a hollow support cylinder standing up. Like the bass drum, the hi-hat has a foot pedal. The bottom cymbal is fixed in place. The top cymbal is mounted on a thin pole which is inserted into the hollow cymbal stand cylinder. The thin pole is connected to a foot pedal. When the foot pedal is pressed down, a mechanism causes the thin pole to move down, causing the cymbals to move together. When the foot is lifted off the pedal, the cymbals move apart, due to the pedal's spring-loaded mechanism. The hi-hats can be sounded by striking the cymbals with one or two sticks or just by opening and closing the cymbals with the footpedal, without striking the cymbals. The ability to create rhythms on the hi-hats with the foot alone enables drummers to use both sticks on other drums or cymbals. Different sounds can be created by striking "open hi-hats" (without the pedal depressed, which creates a noisy sound nicknamed "sloppy hats") or a crisp "closed hi-hats" sound (with the pedal pressed down). As well, the high hats can be played with a partially depressed pedal.

A unique effect can be created by striking an open hi-hat (i.e., in which the two cymbals are apart) and then closing the cymbals with the foot pedal; this effect is widely used in [[disco]] and [[funk]]. The hi-hat has a similar function to the ride cymbal. The two are rarely played consistently for long periods at the same time, but one or the other is used to keep the faster-moving rhythms (e.g., sixteenth notes) much of the time in a song. The hi-hats are played by the right stick of a right-handed drummer. Changing between ride and hi-hat, or between either and a "leaner" sound with neither, is often used to mark a change from one passage to another, for example; to distinguish between a verse and chorus.

====Crashes====
{{main|Crash cymbal}}
The crash cymbals are usually the strongest accent markers within the kit, marking crescendos and climaxes, vocal entries, and major changes of mood/swells and effects. A crash cymbal is often accompanied by a strong kick on the bass drum pedal, both for musical effect and to support the stroke. It provides a fuller sound and is a commonly taught technique.

In the very smallest kits, in jazz, and at very high volumes, ride cymbals may be played in with the technique and sound of a crash cymbal. Some hi-hats will also give a useful crash, particularly thinner hats or those with an unusually severe [[taper (cymbal)|taper]]. At low volumes, producing a good crash from a cymbal not particularly suited to it is a highly skilled art. Alternatively, specialised [[crash/ride]] and ride/crash cymbals are specifically designed to combine both functions.

====Other cymbals====

=====Effects cymbals=====
{{Main|effects cymbal}}
[[File:Sabian O-zone cymbal.jpg|thumb|[[Sabian]] O-zone "vented" crash cymbal]]

All cymbals other than rides, hi-hats and crashes/splashes are usually called [[effects cymbal]]s when used in a drum kit, though this is a non-classical or colloquial designation that has become a standardized label. Most extended kits include one or more [[splash cymbal]]s and at least one [[china cymbal]]. Major cymbal makers produce [[cymbal extension pack]]s consisting of one splash and one china, or more rarely a second crash, a splash and a china, to match some of their starter packs of ride, crash and hi-hats. However any combination of options can be found in the marketplace.

Some cymbals may be considered effects in some kits but "basic" in another set of components. A [[swish cymbal]] may, for example serve, as the main ride in some styles of music, but in a larger kit, which includes a conventional ride cymbal as well, it may well be considered an effects cymbal per se. Likewise, Ozone crashes have the same purpose as a standard crash cymbal, but are considered to be effects cymbals due to their rarity, and the holes cut into them, which provide a darker, more resonant attack.

=====Accent cymbals=====
Cymbals of any type used to provide an [[accent (music)|accent]] rather than a regular pattern or [[groove (drumming)|groove]] are known as accent cymbals. While any cymbal can be used to provide an accent, the term is applied more correctly to cymbals for which the main purpose is to provide an accent. Accent cymbals include chime cymbals, small-bell domed cymbals or those with a clear sonorous/oriental chime to them like specialized crash and splash cymbals and many china types too, particularly the smaller or thinner ones.

===Other acoustic instruments===
[[File:Günter Baby Sommer E5100543.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Günter Sommer]] with [[bodhrán]] and [[bongo drums]] in his kit]] 
Other instruments that have regularly been incorporated into drum kits include:
* [[Wood block]] and [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]]. These are traditional in classic rock. As well, they are used in culturally diverse forms of music
* [[Tambourine]], particularly mounted on the hi-hat stand above the cymbals; an ordinary tambourine can be used, or a tambourine produced specially for drum kit use
* [[Timbales]] can be used to extend the range of tom-toms, particularly when the drummer owns them for other musical settings; a traditional timbale is tuned far higher than a tom of the same diameter, so the result is not always the most ideal (see also [[Timbales#Non-traditional use]])
* [[Xylophone]] or [[glockenspiel]]
* [[Tubular bell]]s
* [[Gong]]s
* [[Bar chimes]]/orchestral chimes
* [[Triangle (musical instrument)|Triangle]]s.
* [[Found object (music)|Found objects]], including [[wrench|spanners]], [[brake drum]]s, [[bucket]]s, [[cardboard box]]es, and jam and kerosene [[tin can|tin]]s (anything ordinary that can be percussively struck to produce sounds, patterns and grooves for their setting)

===Electronic drums===

[[File:V-drums-2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A MIDI drum kit|Drum controllers, such as the [[Roland V-Drums]], are often built in the form of an acoustic drum kit. The unit's sound module is mounted to the left.]]
Electronic drums are used for many reasons. Some drummers use electronic drums for playing in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s or church services, where a very low volume for the band is desired. Since fully electronic drums do not create any acoustic sound (apart from the quiet sound of the stick hitting the sensor pads), all of the drum sounds come from a [[keyboard amplifier]] or [[PA system]]; as such, the volume of electronic drums can be much lower than an acoustic kit. Some drummers use electronic drums as practice instruments, because they can be listened to with headphones, enabling a drummer to practice in an apartment or in the middle of the night without disturbing others. Some drummers use electronic drums to take advantage of the huge range of sounds that modern drum modules can produce, which range from sampled sounds of real drums, cymbals and percussion instruments (including instruments that would be impractical to take to a small gig, such as [[gong]]s or [[tubular bells]]), to electronic and synthesized sounds, including non-instrument sounds such as ocean waves.

A fully electronic kit is also easier to [[soundcheck]] than acoustic drums, assuming that the electronic drum module has levels that the drummer has pre-set in her/his practice room; in contrast, when an acoustic kit is sound checked, most drums and cymbals need to be miked and each mic needs to be tested by the drummer so its level and tone equalization can be adjusted by the [[sound engineer]]. As well, even after all the individual drum and cymbal mics are soundchecked, the engineer needs to listen to the drummer play a standard groove, to check that the balance between the kit instruments is right. Finally, the engineer needs to set up the monitor mix for the drummer, which the drummer uses to hear her/his instruments and the instruments and vocals of the rest of the band. With a fully electronic kit, many of these steps could be eliminated.

Drummers' usage of electronic drum equipment can range from adding a single electronic pad to an acoustic kit (e.g., to have access to an instrument that might otherwise be impractical, such as a large [[gong]]), to using a mix of acoustic drums/cymbals and electronic pads, to using an acoustic kit in which the drums and cymbals have triggers, which can be used to sound electronic drums and other sounds, to having an exclusively electronic kit, which is often set up with the rubber or mesh drum pads and rubber "cymbals" in the usual drum kit locations. A fully electronic kit weighs much less and takes up less space to transport than an acoustic kit and it can be set up more quickly. One of the disadvantages of a fully electronic kit is that it may not have the same "feel" as an acoustic kit, and the drum sounds, even if they are high-quality samples, may not sound the same as acoustic drums.

Electronic drum pads are the second most widely used type of [[MIDI]] performance controllers, after electronic [[keyboard (music)|music keyboards]].&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;Manning, Peter. ''Electronic and Computer Music''. 1985. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|319–320|date=November 2012}} Drum controllers may be built into drum machines, they may be standalone control surfaces (e.g., rubber drum pads), or they may emulate the look and feel of acoustic percussion instruments. The pads built into drum machines are typically too small and fragile to be played with sticks, and they are usually played with fingers.&lt;ref name="Huber"&gt;Huber, David Miles. "The MIDI Manual". Carmel, Indiana: SAMS, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|88|date=November 2012}} Dedicated drum pads such as the [[Roland Octapad]] or the [[DrumKAT]] are playable with the hands or with sticks, and are often built to resemble the general form of a drum kit. There are also percussion controllers such as the [[vibraphone]]-style [[MalletKAT]],&lt;ref name="Huber" /&gt;{{rp|88–91|date=November 2012}} and [[Don Buchla]]'s [[Marimba Lumina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buchla.com/mlumina/description.html |title="Marimba Lumina Described". '&amp;#39;buchla.com'&amp;#39;. n.p. n.d. Web |publisher=Buchla.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101162651/http://www.buchla.com/mlumina/description.html |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as providing an alternative to a conventional acoustic drum kit, electronic drums can be incorporated into an acoustic drum kit to supplement it. [[MIDI]] triggers can also be installed into acoustic drum and percussion instruments. Pads that can trigger a MIDI device can be homemade from a [[piezoelectric sensor]] and a practice pad or other piece of foam rubber.&lt;ref&gt;White, Paul. "[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/aug95/diydrumpads.html DIY Drum Pads And Pedal Triggers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221126/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1995_articles/aug95/diydrumpads.html |date=3 March 2016 }}". ''Sound On Sound'' SOS Publications. Aug 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is possible in two ways:
* [[Trigger (drums)|Trigger]]s are sensors that can be attached to acoustic drum kit components. In this way, an electronic drum sound will be produced when the instrument is played/struck, as well as the original sound voiced by the instrument being available, if so desired .
* [[Trigger pad]]s can be mounted alongside other kit components. These pads make no significant acoustic sound themselves (if not modified to do otherwise), but  are used purely to trigger the electronic sounds from the "drum brain". They are played with the same drum sticks as are used on other drum kit components.

In either case, an electronic [[sound module|control unit]] (sound module/"brain") with suitable sampled/modeled or synthesized drum sounds, amplification equipment (a [[PA system]], [[keyboard amp]], etc.) and [[Foldback (sound engineering)|stage monitor]] speakers are required for the drummer (and other band members and audience) to hear the electronically produced sounds. See [[Electronic drum#Acoustic triggered drum kit|Triggered drum kit]].

A trigger pad could contain up to four independent sensors, each of them capable of sending information describing the timing and dynamic intensity of a stroke to the drum module/brain. A circular drum pad may have only one sensor for triggering, but a 2016-era cymbal-shaped rubber pad/cymbal will often contain two; one for the body and one for the bell at the centre of the cymbal, and perhaps a [[cymbal choke]] trigger, to allow drummers to produce this effect.

Trigger sensors are most commonly used to replace the acoustic drum sounds, but they can often also be used  effectively with an acoustic kit to augment or supplement an instrument's sound for the needs of the session or show. For example, in a live performance in a difficult acoustical space, a trigger may be placed on each drum or cymbal, and used to trigger a similar sound on a [[drum module]]. These sounds are then amplified through the [[PA system]] so the audience can hear them, and they can be amplified to any level without the risks of [[audio feedback]] or bleed problems associated with microphones and PAs in certain settings.

The sound of electronic drums and cymbals themselves is heard by the drummer and possibly other musicians in close proximity, but even so, the [[foldback (sound engineering)|foldback]] (audio monitor) system is usually fed from the electronic sounds rather than the live acoustic sounds. The drums can be heavily dampened (made to resonate less or subdue the sound), and their tuning and even quality is less critical in the latter scenario. In this way, much of the atmosphere of the live performance is retained in a large venue, but without some of the problems associated with purely microphone-amplified drums. Triggers and sensors can also be used in conjunction with conventional or built-in microphones. If some components of a kit prove more difficult to "mike" than others (e.g., an excessively "boomy" low tom), triggers may be used on only the more difficult instruments, balancing out a drummer's/band's sound in the mix.

Trigger pads and drums, on the other hand, when deployed in a conventional set-up, are most commonly used to produce sounds not possible with an acoustic kit, or at least not with what is available. Any sound that can be sampled/recorded can be played when the pad is struck, by assigning the recorded sounds to specific triggers . Recordings or samples of barking dogs, sirens, breaking glass and stereo recordings of aircraft taking off and landing have all been used. Along with the more obvious electronically generated sounds there are synthesized human voices or song parts or even movie audio or digital video/pictures that (depending on device used) can also be played/triggered by electronic drums.

====Virtual drums====
Virtual drums are a type of audio software that simulates the sound of a drum kit using synthesized drum kit sounds or [[Sampling (music)|digital samples]] of acoustic drum sounds. Different drum software products offer a recording function, the ability to select from several acoustically distinctive drum kits (e.g., jazz, rock, metal), as well as the option to incorporate different songs into the session. Some software for the personal computer (PC) can turn any hard surface into a virtual drum kit using only one microphone.

===Hardware===
{{main|drum hardware}}
[[File:20 화합의 아리랑파티-1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A drummer for a Korean Arirang ensemble.]]
''Hardware'' is the name given to the metal stands that support the drums, cymbals and other percussion instruments. Generally the term also includes the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] pedal and [[bass drum pedal]] or pedals, and the [[drum stool]], but not the [[drum stick]]s.

Hardware is carried along with sticks and other accessories in the [[traps case]], and includes:
* [[Cymbal stand]]s
* [[Hi-hat stand]]
* [[Floor tom]] legs
* [[Tom-tom drum]] brackets or arms
* [[Snare drum stand]]
* [[Bass drum pedal]] or pedals
* [[Drum key]]
* Assorted accessories such as spare washers, cymbal sleeves, wire snare cords, washers for tension rods, etc.

Many or even all of the stands may be replaced by a [[drum rack]], particularly useful for large drum kits.

Drummers often set up their own drum hardware onstage and adjust to their own comfort level. Major touring bands on tour will often have a [[Guitar technician|drum tech]] who knows how to set up the drummer's hardware and instruments in the desired location and layout.

==Common configurations==
[[File:Th05SuDaBruniesTrio.jpg|thumb|A two-piece kit in action]]
Drum kits are traditionally categorised by the number of drums, ignoring cymbals and other instruments. Snare, tom-tom and bass drums are always counted; Other drums such as octobans may or may not be counted.&lt;ref name="Peckman 31"&gt;Peckman (2007), p.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sizes of drums and cymbals given below are typical. Many drummers differ slightly or radically from them. Where no size is given, it is because there is too much variety to call a typical size.

===Three-piece===
[[File:Junior drum set.JPG|thumb|Three-piece set for a young player: 16" bass, 10" snare, one 10" hanging tom]]
A three-piece drum set is the most basic set. A conventional three-piece kit consists of a bass drum, a 14" diameter snare drum, 12"–14" hi-hats, a single 12" diameter hanging tom, 8"–9" in depth, and a suspended cymbal, in the range of 14"–18", both mounted on the bass drum. These kits were common in the 1950s and 1960s and are still used in the 2010s in small [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] dance bands. It is a common configuration for kits sold through [[mail order]], and, with smaller sized drums and cymbals, for kits for children.

===Four-piece===
[[File:Jimi Hendrix Experience in Fenklup.png|thumb|[[Mitch Mitchell]] playing a classic four-piece kit in the Jimi Hendrix Experience]]
A four-piece kit extends the three-piece by adding one tom, either a second [[hanging tom]] mounted on the bass drum (a notable user is [[Chris Frantz]] of [[Talking Heads]]) and often displacing the cymbal, or by adding a [[floor tom]]. Normally another cymbal is added as well, so there are separate ride and crash cymbals, either on two stands, or the ride cymbal mounted on the bass drum to the player's right and the crash cymbal on a separate stand. The standard cymbal sizes are 16" crash and 18"–20" ride, with the 20" ride most common.

====Four piece with floor tom====
When a floor tom is added to make a four-piece kit, the floor tom is usually 14" for jazz, and 16" otherwise. This configuration is usually common in [[jazz]], classic [[Rock music|rock]] and [[rock and roll]]. Notable users include [[Ringo Starr]] in [[The Beatles]], [[Mitch Mitchell]] in the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]], and [[John Barbata]] in [[the Turtles]]. For jazz, which normally emphasizes the use of [[ride cymbal]], the lack of second hanging tom in a four-piece kit allows the cymbal to be positioned closer to the drummer, making them easier to be struck.

====Four piece with two hanging toms====
If a second hanging tom is used, it is 10" diameter and 8" deep for fusion, or 13" diameter and one inch deeper than the 12" diameter tom. Otherwise, a 14" diameter hanging tom is added to the 12", both being 8" deep. In any case, both toms are most often mounted on the bass drum with the smaller of the two next to the hi-hats (on the left for a right-handed drummer). These kits are particularly useful for smaller venues where space is limited, such as coffeehouses and small pubs.

===Five-piece===
[[File:Platin Drums PTCL2016 AF.jpg|thumb|250px|A basic five-piece fusion kit, with one crash cymbal and no effects cymbals, complete with throne (stool) and sticks]]
The five-piece kit is the full entry-level kit and the most common configuration. It adds a third tom to the bass drum/snare drum/two toms set, making three toms in all. A fusion kit will normally add a 14" tom, either a floor tom or a hanging tom on a stand to the right of the bass drum; in either case, making the tom lineup 10", 12" and 14". Having three toms enables drummers to have a low-pitched, middle-register and higher-pitched tom, which gives them more options for fills and solos.

Other kits will normally have 12" and 13" hanging toms plus either a 14" hanging tom on a stand, a 14" floor tom, or a 16" floor tom. For depths, see [[Tom-tom drum#Modern tom-toms]].  In the 2010s, it is very popular to have 10" and 12" hanging toms, with a 16" floor tom.  This configuration is often called a hybrid setup.&lt;ref name=SteveWeiss&gt;Steve Weiss Music {{cite web |url=http://www.steveweissmusic.com/category/drum-sets |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418150354/http://www.steveweissmusic.com/category/drum-sets |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }} 5/10/2012&lt;/ref&gt; The bass drum is most commonly 22" in diameter, but rock kits may use 24", fusion 20", jazz 18",&lt;ref name="Peckman 31" /&gt; and in larger bands up to 26". A second crash cymbal is common, typically an inch or two larger or smaller than the 16", with the larger of the two to the right for a right-handed drummer, but a big band may use crashes up to 20" and ride up to 24" or, very rarely, 26". A rock kit may also substitute a larger ride cymbal or larger hi-hats, typically 22" for the ride and 15" for the hats.

Most five-piece kits, at more than entry level, also have one or more [[effects cymbal]]s. Adding cymbals beyond the basic ride, hi-hats and one crash configuration requires more stands in addition to the standard [[drum hardware pack]]s. Because of this, many higher-cost kits for professionals are sold with little or even no hardware, to allow the drummer to choose the stands and also the [[bass drum pedal]] he/she prefers. At the other extreme, many inexpensive, entry-level kits are sold as a five-piece kit complete with two [[cymbal stand]]s, most often one straight and one boom, and some even with a standard [[cymbal pack]], a [[Drum stool|stool]] and a pair of [[5A (drum stick)|5A]] drum sticks. In the 2010s, [[electronic drum|digital]] kits are often offered in a five-piece kit, usually with one plastic crash cymbal triggers and one ride cymbal trigger. Fully electronic drums do not produce any acoustic sound beyond the quiet tapping of sticks on the plastic or rubber heads. The trigger-pads are wired up to a [[synth module]] or [[Sampler (music)|sampler]].

===Small kits===
[[File:Slim Jim Phantom Stray Cats, Sweden 2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[Neo-Rockabilly]] pioneer [[Slim Jim Phantom]] playing a two-piece kit while standing]]

If the toms are omitted completely, or the bass drum is replaced by a pedal-operated beater on the bottom skin of a floor tom and the hanging toms omitted, the result is a two-piece "[[Cocktail drum|cocktail]]" (lounge) kit. Such kits are particularly favoured in musical genres such as [[trad jazz]], [[rockabilly]] and [[jump blues]]. Some rockabilly kits and beginners kits for very young players omit the hi-hat stand. In rockabilly, this allows the drummer to play standing rather than seated.

Although these kits may be small with respect to the number of drums used, the drums themselves are most often normal sizes, or even larger in the case of the bass drum. Kits using smaller drums in both smaller and larger configurations are also produced for particular uses, such as ''boutique'' kits designed to reduce the visual impact that a large kit creates or due space constraints in coffeehouses, ''travelling'' kits to reduce luggage volume, and junior kits for very young players. Smaller drums also tend to be quieter, again suiting smaller venues, and many of these kits extend this with extra muffling which allows quiet or even silent practice in a hotel room or bedroom.  

===Extended kits===
[[File:OutsideBRX-15.JPG|right|thumb|200px | A seven-piece kit with snare, double bass drums, two hanging toms, two floor toms, hi-hats, ride cymbal, three crash cymbals, splash cymbal and china type]]

Common extensions beyond these standard configurations include:
* [[Effects cymbal]]s, particularly [[splash cymbal]]s and [[china cymbal]]s
* [[Double bass drum]]s. Double bass drums or a [[double bass pedal]] are standard for some genres, particularly in heavy metal music
* Extra hanging or [[rack tom]]s
* Extra Crash cymbals
* A [[crash/ride cymbal]] in addition to the main ride
* A second, larger or smaller floor tom
* One or more [[octoban]]s or a pair of [[mini timbales]]
* A second pair of hi-hats mounted as [[cable hats]] or [[x-hats]]
* [[Cymbal stack]]s
* Individual tiger, wind or chau [[gong]]s
* Multiple ride cymbals. A [[sizzle cymbal]], thinner and larger than the main ride, was once common as a second ride or crash/ride, even in a four-piece kit, but is now less so (jazz drummers, however, may still have two or more ride cymbals, even in a small kit)

See also [[#Other acoustic instruments|other acoustic instruments]] above. Another versatile extension becoming increasingly common is the use of some [[#Electronic drums|electronic drums]] in a mainly conventional kit.

Less common extensions found particularly, but not exclusive to very large kits, include:
* Multiple snare drums, usually in the form of side snares. A side snare is usually positioned to the left of the drummer (opposite the floor toms and to the left of the hi hat). Side snares are used similarly to effects cymbals, when an additional and different sound is required. Generally only one side snare is used on a kit, if any at all. 
* Multiple bass drums beyond the double bass drum setup
* [[Gong drum]]s (single headed bass drums, played with sticks or mallets)
* Sets of [[gong]]s, tuned or untuned
* Sound effects such as a [[thunder sheet]]
* One or more [[crotales]]
* Instruments "borrowed" from [[orchestral percussion]], such as [[timpani]]
* Instruments "borrowed" from [[marching band]] percussion, such as the tuned bass drums used in the [[drumline]]

==Accessories==

===Sticks===
{{main|Drum stick}}
Sticks were traditionally made from wood (particularly maple, hickory, and oak} but more recently metal, carbon fibre and other exotic materials have been used for high market end sticks. The prototypical wooden drum stick was primarily designed for use with the snare drum, and optimised for playing [[snare rudiment]]s. Sticks come in a variety of weights and tip designs; 7N is a common jazz stick with a nylon tip, while a 5B is a common wood tipped stick, heavier than a 7N but with a similar profile, and a common standard for beginners. Numbers range from 1 (heaviest) to 10 (lightest).

The meanings of both numbers and letters vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, and some sticks are not described using this system at all, just being known as ''Smooth Jazz'' (typically a 7N or 9N) or ''Speed Rock'' (typically a 2B or 3B) for example. Many famous drummers endorse sticks made to their particular preference and sold under their signature. 
[[File:Rogers Roy Burns sticks.jpg|thumb|300px]]
Besides drumsticks, drummers will also use brushes and rutes in jazz and similar softer music. More rarely, other beaters such as [[cartwheel mallet]]s (known to kit drummers as "soft sticks") may be used. It is not uncommon for rock drummers to use the "wrong" (butt) end of a stick for a heavier sound; some makers produce tipless sticks with two butt ends.

A stick bag is the standard way for a drummer to bring drumsticks to a live performance. For easy access, the stick bag is commonly mounted on the side of the floor tom, just within reach of the drummer’s right hand for a right-handed drummer.

===Muffles===
[[File:Ring muffle on snare.jpg|thumb|Mylar muffle ring on snare.]]
Drum muffles are types of [[mute (music)|mute]]s that can reduce the ring, boomy [[overtone]] frequencies, or overall volume on a [[snare drum|snare]], [[bass drum|bass]], or [[tom-tom drum|tom]]. Controlling the ring is useful in studio or live settings when unwanted frequencies can clash with other instruments in the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]]. There are internal and external muffling devices which rest on the inside or outside of the [[drumhead]], respectively. Common types of mufflers include muffling rings,  [[Moongel|gels]] and duct tape, and improvised methods, such as placing a wallet near the edge of the head.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musiciansfriend.com/browse/article.jsp?mediaId=m710466] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617105218/http://www.musiciansfriend.com/browse/article.jsp?mediaId=m710466|date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some drummers muffle the sound of a drum by putting a cloth over the drumhead.

'''Snare drum and tom-tom'''
Typical ways to muffle a snare or tom include placing an object on the outer edge of the drumhead. A piece of cloth, a wallet, [[Moongel|gel]], or fitted rings made of [[BoPET|mylar]] are common objects. Also used are external clip-on muffles that work using the same principle. Internal mufflers that lie on the inside of the drumhead are often built into a drum, but are generally considered less effective than external muffles, as they stifle the initial tone, rather than simply reducing the sustain of it.

'''Bass drum'''
Muffling the bass can be achieved with the same muffling techniques as the snare, but bass drums in a drum kit are more commonly muffled by adding pillows, a sleeping bag or another soft filling inside the drum, between the heads. Cutting a small hole in the resonant head can also produce a more muffled tone, and allows manipulation in internally placed muffling. The Evans EQ pad places a pad against the batterhead and, when struck, the pad moves off the head momentarily, then returns to rest against the head, thus reducing the sustain without choking the tone.

'''Silencers/mutes'''
Another type of drum muffler is a piece of rubber that fits over the entire drumhead or [[cymbal]]. It interrupts contact between the [[Drum stick|stick]] and the head which dampens the sound even more. They are typically used in practice settings.

'''Cymbals''' are usually muted with the fingers or hand, to reduce the length or volume of ringing (e.g., the [[cymbal choke]] technique which is a key part of [[heavy metal drumming]]). Cymbals can also be muted with special rubber rings or with [[DIY]] approaches such as using duct tape.

'''Historical uses'''
Muffled drums are often associated with funeral ceremonies as well, such as the funerals of [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/funeral-of-queen-victoria |title=Funeral Of Queen Victoria – British Pathé |publisher=Britishpathe.com |date=2010-07-18 |accessdate=2014-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704180143/http://www.britishpathe.com/video/funeral-of-queen-victoria |archivedate=4 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|AiqrUMvxbbs|The Funeral of John F.

(n.d.). Learning to play the drum: an experiential. 43(4), 435–444.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stick holder===
There are various types of stick holder accessories, including bags that can be attached to a drum and angled sheath-style stick holders, which can hold a single pair of sticks.

===Sizzlers===
[[File:aasizzler3.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Chain sizzlers mounted on a Paiste 11" trad splash (top) and Paiste 2002 18" medium|Chain sizzlers mounted on a Paiste 11" trad splash (top) and Paiste 2002 18" medium]]
[[File:aasizzler2.jpg|thumb|Detail of a Paiste 2002 18" medium cymbal fitted with a chain sizzler]]
A [[sizzler (percussion)|sizzler]] is a metal chain or combination of chains that is hung across a cymbal, creating a distinctive metallic sound when the cymbal is struck similar to that of a [[sizzle cymbal]]. Using a sizzler is the non-destructive alternative to drilling holes in a cymbal and putting metal rivets in the holes. Another benefit of using a "sizzler" chain is that the chain can be removed and the cymbal will return to its normal sound (in contrast, a cymbal with rivets would have to have the rivets removed).
Some sizzlers feature pivoting arms that allow the chains to be quickly raised from the cymbal, or lowered onto it, allowing the effect to be used for some songs and removed for others.

===Cases===
[[File:Drum kit cases.JPG|thumb|A five-piece kit in hard cases. From left: [[traps case]], floor tom case, snare drum case (in front), twin hanging toms case, cymbal case. Rear: bass drum case.]]
Three types of protective covers are common for kit drums:
* Drum bags are made from robust cloth such as [[cordura]] or from cloth-backed [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]. They give minimal protection from bumps and impacts, but they do protect drums and cymbals from precipitation. They are adequate for drums transported in private vehicles to go to local gigs and sessions. They are often the only option for young drummers who are just starting out.
* Mid-price hard cases are of similar construction to [[suitcase]]s, commonly made of fibre composite. The offer more protection from bumps than cloth bags.
*[[Flight case]]s or [[road case]]s are standard for professional touring drummers.

As with all musical instruments, the best protection is a provided by a combination of a hard-shelled case with padding such as foam next to the drums or cymbals.

===Microphones===
[[File:Carl Palmer.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Palmer]] with rim-mounted tom mics]]
[[Microphone]]s ("mics") are used with drums to pick up the sound of the drums and cymbals for a [[sound recording]] and/or to pick up the sound of the drum kit so that it can be amplified through a [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]]. While most drummers use microphones and amplification in live shows in the 2010s, so that the [[sound engineer]] can adjust and balance the levels of the drums and cymbals, some bands that play in quieter genres of music and that play in small venues such as [[coffeehouse]]s play acoustically, without mics or PA amplification. Small jazz groups such as [[jazz quartet]]s or [[organ trio]]s that are playing in a small bar will often just use acoustic drums. Of course if the same small jazz groups play on the mainstage of a big jazz festival, the drums will be mic'ed so that they can be adjusted in the sound system mix. A middle-ground approach is used by some bands that play in small venues; they do not mic every drum and cymbal, but rather mic only the instruments that the sound engineer wants to be able to control in the mix, such as the bass drum and the snare.

In "miking" a drum kit, [[dynamic microphone]]s, which can handle high sound-pressure levels, are usually used to close-mic drums, which is the predominant way to mic drums for live shows.  [[Condenser microphone]]s are used for overheads and room mics, an approach which is more common with sound recording applications. Close miking of drums may be done using stands or by mounting the microphones on the rims of the drums, or even using microphones built into the drum itself, which eliminates the need for stands for these microphones, reducing both clutter and set-up time, as well as isolating them.

In some styles of music, drummers use electronic effects on drums, such as individual [[noise gate]]s that mute the attached microphone when the signal is below a threshold volume. This allows the sound engineer to use a higher overall volume for the drum kit by reducing the number of "active" mics which could produce unwanted [[Acoustic feedback|feedback]] at any one time. When a drum kit is entirely miked and amplified through the [[sound reinforcement system]], the drummer or the sound engineer can add other [[effect units|electronic effects]] to the drum sound, such as [[reverb]] or [[digital delay]].

Some drummers arrive at the venue with their drum kit and use the mics and mic stands provided by the venue's sound engineer. Other drummers bring their all of their own mics, or selected mics (e.g., a good quality bass drum mic and a good mic for the snare) to ensure that they have good quality mics for each show. In bars and nightclubs, the microphones supplied by the venue can sometimes be in substandard condition, due to the heavy use they experience.

{{Clear}}
===Monitors===
Drummers using [[electronic drums]], [[drum machine]]s, or hybrid acoustic-electric kits (which blend traditional acoustic drums and cymbals with electronic pads) typically use a [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speaker]], [[keyboard amplifier]] or even a small [[PA system]] to hear the electronic drum sounds. Even a drummer playing entirely acoustic drums may use a monitor speaker to hear her drums, especially if she is playing in a loud rock or metal band, where there is substantial onstage volume from huge, powerful guitar stacks. Since the drum kit uses the deep bass drum, drummers are often given a large speaker cabinet with a 15" [[subwoofer]] to help them monitor their bass drum sound (along with a full-range monitor speaker to hear the rest of their kit). Some sound engineers and drummers prefer to use an electronic vibration system, colloquially known as a "[[butt shaker]]" or "throne thumper" to monitor the bass drum, because this lowers the stage volume. With a "butt shaker", the "thump" of each bass drum strike causes a vibration in the drum stool; this way the drummer ''feels'' their beat on the posterior, rather than hears it.

===Bass drum gear===
A number of accessories are designed for the bass drum (also called "kick drum"). Ported tubes for the bass drum are available to take advantage of the [[bass reflex]] speaker design, in which a tuned port (a hole and a carefully measured tube) are put in a [[speaker enclosure]] to improve the bass response at the lowest frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/KickPortB |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220171718/http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/KickPortB |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bass drumhead patches are available, which protect the drumhead from the impact of the felt beater. Bass drum pillows are fabric bags with filling or stuffing that can be used to alter the tone or resonance of the bass drum. A less expensive alternative to using a specialized bass drum pillow is to use an old sleeping bag.

===Gloves===
Some drummers wear special drummer's gloves to improve their grip on the sticks when they play. Drumming gloves often have a textured grip surface made of a synthetic or rubber material and mesh or vents on the parts of the glove not used to hold sticks, to ventilate perspiration.

===Drum screen===
[[File:Tris Imboden.jpg|thumb|American rock and jazz drummer [[Tris Imboden]] using a clear perspex drum screen on stage.]]{{main|drum screen}}
In some styles or settings, such as country music clubs or churches, small venues, or when a live recording is being made, the drummer may use a transparent perspex or [[plexiglas]] ''drum screen'' (also known as a ''drum shield'') to dampen the onstage volume of the drums. A screen that completely surrounds the drum kit is known as a ''drum booth''. In live sound applications, drum shields are used so that the [[audio engineer]] can have more control over the volume of drums that the audience hears through the [[PA system]] mix or to reduce the overall volume of the drums, as a way to reduce the overall volume of the band in the venue. In some recording studios, foam and fabric baffles are used in addition to or in place of clear panels. The drawback with foam/cloth baffle panels is that the drummer cannot see other performers, the record producer or the audio engineer well.
{{Clear}}
[[File:Hi-hat stand spikes.PNG|thumb|Two hi-hat stands, both with retractable spikes extended]]

===Carpets===
Drummers often bring a carpet, mats or rugs to venues to prevent the bass drum and hi-hat stand from "crawling" (moving away) on a slippery surface from the drum head striking the bass drum. The carpet also reduces short reverberation (which is generally but not always an advantage), and helps to prevent damage to the flooring or floor coverings. In shows where multiple drummers will bring their kits onstage over the night, it is common for drummers to mark the location of their stands and pedals with tape, to allow for quicker positioning of a kits in a drummer's accustomed position. Bass drums and hi-hat stands commonly have retractable spikes to help them to grip surfaces such as carpet, or stay stationary (on hard surfaces) with rubber feet.

===Practice equipment===
[[File:ARNO DRUM KEYS COLLECTION Custom Drum Key.jpg|thumb|100px|An Arno drum key]]
Drummers use a variety of accessories when practicing. [[Metronome]]s and beat counters are used to develop a sense of a steady pulse. Drum muffling pads may be used to lessen the volume of drums during practicing. A [[practice pad]], held on the lap, on a leg, or mounted on a stand, is used for near-silent practice with drumsticks. A set of practice pads mounted to simulate an entire drum kit is known as a practice kit. In the 2010s, these have largely been superseded by [[electronic drums]], which can be listened to with headphones for quiet practice and kits with non-sounding mesh heads.

===Tuning equipment===
{{main|drum key}}
Drummers use a [[drum key]] for tuning their drums and adjusting some drum hardware. Besides the basic type of drum key (a T-handled wrench) there are various tuning wrenches and tools. Basic drum keys are divided in three types which allows tuning of three types of tuning screws on drums: square (most used), slotted and hexagonal. Ratchet-type wrenches allow high-tension drums to be tuned easily. Spin keys (utilizing a ball joint) allow rapid head changing. Torque-wrench type keys are available, graphically revealing the torque at each lug. Also, tension gauges, or meters, which are set on the head, aid drummers to achieve a consistent tuning. Drummers can tune drums "[[Playing by ear|by ear]]" or, in the 2010s, use a digital drum tuner, which "measures tympanic pressure" on the drumhead to provide accurate tuning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/DrumdialDigital |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-09-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911120620/http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/DrumdialDigital |archivedate=11 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing==

===Grooves===
{{main|drum beat}}
Kit drumming, whether playing [[accompaniment]] of voices and other instruments or doing a [[drum solo]], consists of two elements:
* A [[groove (music)|groove]] which sets the basic timefeel and provides a rhythmic framework for the song (examples include a [[Beat (music)#Backbeat|back beat]] or [[Rosanna shuffle|shuffle]]).
* [[Drum fill]]s and other [[ornament (music)|ornament]]s and [[variation (music)|variation]]s which provide variety and add interest to the drum sound. Fills could include a [[Sting (percussion)|sting]] at the end of a musical section or act as a drum showpiece.

===Fills===
{{main|drum fill}}
A ''[[Fill (music)|fill]]'' is a departure from the repetitive rhythm pattern in a song. A drum fill is used to "fill in" the space between the end of one verse and the beginning of another verse or chorus. Fills vary from a simple few strokes on a tom or snare, to a distinctive rhythm played on the hi-hat, to sequences several bars long that are short virtuosic [[drum solo]]s. As well as adding interest and variation to the music, fills serve an important function in preparing and indicating significant  changes of sections in songs and linking sections. A ''vocal cue'' is a short drum fill that introduces a vocal entry. A fill ending with a cymbal crash on beat one is often used to lead into a [[chorus (song)|chorus]] or [[verse (popular music)|verse]].

===Drum solos===
{{main|drum solo}}
A drum solo is an instrumental section that highlights the virtuosity, skill and musical creativity of the drummer. While other instrument solos such as [[guitar solo]]s are typically accompanied by the other [[rhythm section]] instruments (e.g., [[bass guitar]] and [[electric guitar]]), for most drum solos, all the other band members stop playing so that all of the audience's focus will be on the drummer. In some drum solos, the other rhythm section instrumentalists may play "punches" at certain points–sudden, loud chords of a short duration.  Drum solos are common in [[jazz]], but they are also used in a number of [[rock music|rock]] genres, such as [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[progressive rock]].  During drum solos, drummers have a great deal of creative freedom, and drummers often use the entire drum kit. In live concerts, drummers may be given long drum solos, even in genres where drum solos are rare on singles.

===Grips===
{{main|grip (percussion)}}
[[File:Traditional Grip.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A pair of drumsticks held in traditional grip.]]
Most drummers hold the drumsticks in one of two types of grip:
* The [[traditional grip]], originally developed for playing the military [[side drum]], most commonly with an overhand grip for the right hand and an underhand for the left. It arose from the need to clear the counter-hoop (rim) of an angled marching drum (due to the single-point attachment of the drum sling).
* The [[matched grip]], in which the sticks are held in similar (but [[mirror image]]) fashion.
Within these two types, there is still considerable variation, and even disagreements as to exactly how the stick is held in a particular method. For example, [[Jim Chapin]], an early and influential exponent of the [[Moeller method]], asserts that the technique does not rely on rebound,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG311pfsGE |title=Jim Chapin talks about the Moeller Method |date=2007-01-22 |accessdate=2014-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630092234/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZG311pfsGE |archivedate=30 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Dave Weckl]] asserts that it does rely on rebound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFZfOLbnBwI |title=Dave Weckl – Moeller Technique |date=2007-01-29 |accessdate=2014-07-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016154321/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFZfOLbnBwI |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Music-neutralclef.svg|thumb|Neutral or ''percussion clef'', two versions]]

===Notation and improvisation===
{{main|percussion notation|music improvisation}}
Drum kit music is either written down in [[music notation]] (called "drum parts"), learned and played "[[Playing by ear|by ear]]",  [[music improvisation|improvised]] or some combination of some or all three of these methods. Professional [[session musician]] drummers and [[Big Band]] jazz drummers are often required to read drum parts. Drum parts are most commonly written on a standard five-line [[staff (music)|staff]]. In 2016, a special ''[[percussion clef]]'' is used, while previously the [[bass clef]] was used. However, even if the bass or no clef is used, each line and space is assigned an instrument of the kit, rather than to a pitch. In [[jazz]], [[traditional music]], [[folk music]], [[rock music]] and [[pop music]], drummers are expected to be able to learn songs by ear (from a recording or from another musician who is playing or singing the song) and improvise. The degree of improvisation differs in different styles. [[Jazz]] and [[jazz fusion]] drummers may have lengthy improvised solos in every song. In [[rock music]] and [[blues]], there are also drum solos in some songs, although they tend to be shorter than those in jazz. Drummers  in all [[popular music]] and [[traditional music]] styles are expected to be able to improvise [[accompaniment]] parts to songs, once they are told the genre or style (e.g., [[shuffle]], [[ballad]], [[Blues|slow blues]], etc.).

[[File:Christen Købke - Autumn Morning on Lake Sortedam.jpg|thumb|Christen Købke: ''Efterårsmorgen ved Sortedamssøen'' (1838)]]
'''''Efterårsmorgen ved Sortedamssøen''''' ('''Autumn Morning on Lake Sortedam''') is an oil painting by [[Christen Købke]], one of the leading artists in the [[Golden Age of Danish Painting]]. Included in the 2006 [[Danish Culture Canon]], the painting hangs in Copenhagen's [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]].&lt;ref name=kulturkanon&gt;[http://kum.dk/Documents/Temaer/Kulturkanon/KUM_kulturkanonen_OK2.pdf "Efterårsmorgen ved Sortedamssøen"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211223858/http://kum.dk/Documents/Temaer/Kulturkanon/KUM_kulturkanonen_OK2.pdf |date=December 11, 2012 }}, Kulturkanon {{da icon}} Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
From 1833 to 1843, Købke lived with his parents on Blegdamsvej in Copenhagen in a house close to [[Sortedam Lake]]. He also painted several scenes of [[Blegdam Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mindmeister.com/generic_files/get_file/1247746?filetype=attachment_file "Efterårsmorgen ved Sortedamssøen"], Mindmeister.com. {{da icon}} Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
With its almost bare trees and pale light, the painting conveys the atmosphere of a November morning. The man, walking alone along the lakeside, adds to the melancholy of the scene. One can almost hear the gentle rustling of the leaves, the man's distant footsteps and the lapping of the water against the reeds.&lt;ref name=glyptotek&gt;[http://glyptoteket.wordpress.com/2008/11/03/manedens-v%C3%A6rk-november/ "Månedens værk. November: Christen Købke, Efterårsmorgen ved Sortedamssøen, 1838"], Ny Carlsberg Glyptoteket. {{da icon}} Retrieved 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting's vertical and horizontal lines provide a fine balance which is typical of Købke's ability to convey a sense of peacefulness in his compositions. His appreciation of colour can be seen in the pale pink morning light.&lt;ref name=kulturkanon/&gt;

From his letters, we know that Købke was depressed at the time he painted the scene. That could explain the coolness of the painting which differs strikingly from Købke's other works depicting much more pleasant scenes of spring and summer.&lt;ref name=glyptotek/&gt;

'''''El gesticulador''''' ('''''The Impostor''''') is a 1938 play by [[Mexico|Mexican]] dramatist [[Rodolfo Usigli]].

==Plot==
The protagonist, César Rubio, is an unemployed professor who, in the aftermath of the [[Mexican Revolution]], settles with his family in a small town in the north of Mexico. There, a professor from [[Harvard University]] confuses him for a missing revolutionary hero with the same name. Rubio claims to be the deceased hero, telling the professor that, disillusioned with the course of the Revolution, he had embraced anonymity until thirty years thereafter. The story is published in ''[[The New York Times]]'', and Rubio comes to the attention of his compatriots, receiving accolades and fielding offers to run for the governorship of his state against a corrupt Revolutionary general. Rubio loses himself in his new identity, viewing it as an opportunity to renew the promise of the Revolution.
Things go awry when the corrupt general against whom César is running forces a meeting between the two. In their conversation, each attempts to blackmail the other. Navarro, the corrupt general, knows that César is not the general he claims to be. César, on the other hand, figures out that Navarro killed general César Rubio during the war. Outside the door was César's son, who had trouble reconciling his father's newly revealed heroism. Despite Navarro's threats, César proceeds with his candidacy for governor. After leaving to attend the election, Miguel, Julia, and Elena (César's son, daughter, and wife, respectively) discuss the nature of their father's actions; Julia supports him, while Miguel, and ultimately Elena are unable to come to terms with his lie. However, Elena also realizes that Navarro will try to kill César, and sends Miguel to warn his father of the assassination. Unfortunately, he arrives too late; both César and the assassin have been killed, leaving no link back to Navarro. Navarro briefly returns to the house to gloat before addressing the crowd outside, promising that César will be treated as a hero and his family will be taken care of. While the crowd is initially hesitant, Navarro's apparent goodwill convinces them, and they cheer both him and César.

==Controversy==
The play was daring for its time in that it used the true language of contemporary politics, a first for [[Mexican literature]].&lt;ref name="Krauze"&gt;Krauze, 526&lt;/ref&gt; Originally published in the literary review ''El hijo pródigo'' in 1938, the play was not staged until 1947. Its debut in the [[Mexico City]]'s [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] was welcomed by the theater-going public, but was met with hostility by the [[Mexican government]]. At issue was the play's declaration of the death of the Mexican Revolution in its institutionalization in the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]].&lt;ref&gt;Beardsell, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government cancelled several performances, and writers were hired to severely criticize the performances that were allowed to go on. The work thus became the only play in Mexican history to be [[censorship|censored]] by the government.

'''European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation''' ('''EFFFF'''), established in 1987, is a network of 22 [[genre film]] festivals from 16 countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.melies.org/the-federation|title=The Federation {{!}} European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation|last=Interactive|first=E-turundusagentuur ADM|website=www.melies.org|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; based [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], and dedicated to promoting and supporting European cinema, particularly films in the [[fantasy film|fantasy]], [[horror film|horror]] and [[science fiction film|science fiction]] genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/screaming-room/5043456.article|title=Screaming Room|last=Sandwell|first=Ian|work=[[Screen Daily]]|date=2012-07-12|accessdate=2014-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernest Mathijs and Jamie Sexton describe it as "the biggest fan-based cult-network on the continent", comparable in scope to [[World Science Fiction Convention]], [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], and [[Fangoria's Weekend of Horrors]], though less commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mathijs|first1=Ernest|last2=Sexton|first2=Jamie|title=Cult Cinema|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=2012|isbn=9781444396430|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPtuaV7IAt0C&amp;pg=PT59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFFFF annually awards the Golden Méliès (''Méliès d'or'') for the best European fantastic feature film and short film, and the Federation Award for Best Asian Film.

== History ==
The EFFFF was founded in 1987 on the initiative of five film festivals: the [[Fantafestival]] in Rome, [[Fantasporto]] in Porto, the Paris International Fantastic Films Festival, the [[Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival]] and the [[Sitges Film Festival]].

The EFFFF created its first awards in 1995, the ''Méliès d'argent'' (Silver Méliès) and the ''Méliès d'or'' (Golden Méliès), named in honour of [[Georges Méliès]], the great French pioneer of fantastic cinema and special effects. The awards were intended to highlight the creativity and quality of European fantastic films, stimulate production and promote them worldwide. The first Méliès d'or ceremony was held by the [[Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival]] in 1996 and the prize was given to [[Álex de la Iglesia]] for ''[[The Day of the Beast]]'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''El día de la Bestia'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cinema of Álex de la Iglesia|last=Willis|first=Andy|last2=Triana-Toribio|first2=Nuria|last3=Buse|first3=Peter|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-7190-7137-9|location=Manchester|pages=55|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Méliès d'Or==
Since 1996, the EFFFF has awarded the annual Méliès d'Or and Méliès d'Argent (Golden or Silver [[Georges Méliès|Méliès]]) for the Best European Fantastic Feature Film.

The '''flag of Adjara''' is a flag of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]'s [[autonomous republic]] of [[Adjara]]. It displays seven dark blue and white stripes, with the national [[flag of Georgia (country)|flag of Georgia]] shown in [[canton (heraldry)|canton]]. The dark blue stripes symbolize the [[Black Sea]] and the white stripes symbolize purity. The flag was adopted on 20 July 2004 by the Supreme Council of Adjara.

== Former Flags ==

Between June 2000 and July 2004, a different flag was used by the government of [[Aslan Abashidze]]. The blue background represents the [[Black Sea]], while the seven stars represent Ajaria's two cities ([[Batumi]] and [[Kobuleti]]) and five districts (Batumi, Kobuleti, [[Keda, Georgia|Keda]], [[Shuakhevi]], [[Khulo]]).

Under the [[Soviet Union]], the Ajarian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (AASSR) had its own flag between 1921-1950 and again between 1978 and 1991. This consisted of a motif very similar to that of the parent [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]], plus the initials of the AASSR in [[Georgian language|Georgian]].

&lt;!--Please do not remove the phrase and link to "creation myth" from the first paragraph without discussing your proposal on the talk page first. There has been a consensus since November 2011 to include it in the lead. You can read the archived talk discussion at: Talk:Genesis_creation_narrative/Archive_13#RfC:_Genesis_creation_narrative:_link_to_creation_myth.2C_yes_or_no.3F--&gt;

The '''Genesis creation narrative''' is the [[creation myth]] of both [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Leeming|Leeming|2009|p=113}} The narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the first two chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]]. In the first, [[Elohim]] (the Hebrew generic word for [[God]]) creates the heavens and the earth in six days, then rests on, blesses and sanctifies the [[Biblical Sabbath|seventh]]. In the second story, God, now referred to by the personal name [[Yahweh]], creates [[Adam]], the first man, from dust and places him in the [[Garden of Eden]], where he is given dominion over the animals. [[Eve]], the first woman, is created from Adam and as his companion.

Borrowing themes from [[Mesopotamian mythology]], but adapting them to the [[Israelites|Israelite]] people's [[monotheism|belief in one God]],{{sfn|Sarna|1997|p=50}} the first major comprehensive draft of the [[Pentateuch]] (the series of five books which begins with Genesis and ends with [[Deuteronomy]]) was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the [[Jahwist]] source) and was later expanded by other authors (the [[Priestly source]]) into a work very like the one we have today.{{sfn|Davies|2007|p=37}} The two sources can be identified in the creation narrative:  Priestly and Jahwistic.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=37}} The combined narrative is a critique of the Mesopotamian theology of creation: Genesis affirms monotheism and denies polytheism.{{sfn|Wenham|2003b|p=37}} [[Robert Alter]] described the combined narrative as "compelling in its archetypal character, its adaptation of myth to [[monotheist]]ic ends".{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=xii}}

Misunderstanding the [[genre]] of the Genesis creation narrative, meaning the intention of the author(s) and the culture within which they wrote, can result in a misreading.{{sfn|Andersen|1987|p=142}} [[Bruce Waltke]], a well-known evangelical scholar, cautions against one such misreading, the approach which reads it as history rather than theology and so leads to [[Creationism]] and the denial of [[evolution]].{{sfn|Waltke|1991|pp=6–9}} As noted scholar of [[Jewish studies]], [[Jon D. Levenson]], puts it:
{{quote|How much history lies behind the story of Genesis? Because the action of the primeval story is not represented as taking place on the plane of ordinary human history and has so many affinities with ancient mythology, it is very far-fetched to speak of its narratives as historical at all."{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=11}}}}

==Composition==
[[File:Bm-epic-g.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] tablet with the Atra-Hasis Epic in the [[British Museum]]]]

===Sources===
{{See also|Documentary hypothesis}}
Although tradition attributes Genesis to [[Moses]], biblical scholars hold that it, together with the following four books (making up what Jews call the [[Torah]] and biblical scholars call the Pentateuch), is "a composite work, the product of many hands and periods."{{sfn|Speiser|1964|p=xxi}} A common hypothesis among biblical scholars today is that the first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the [[Jahwist]] source), and that this was later expanded by the addition of various narratives and laws (the [[Priestly source]]) into a work very like the one existing today.{{sfn|Davies|2007|p=37}}

As for the historical background which led to the creation of the narrative itself, a theory which has gained considerable interest, although still controversial, is "Persian imperial authorisation". This proposes that the Persians, after their [[Babylon#Persia captures Babylon|conquest of Babylon]] in 538 BCE, agreed to grant Jerusalem a large measure of local autonomy within the empire, but required the local authorities to produce a single [[List of ancient legal codes|law code]] accepted by the entire community. It further proposes that there were two powerful groups in the community – the priestly families who controlled the Temple, and the landowning families who made up the "elders" – and that these two groups were in conflict over many issues, and that each had its own "history of origins", but the Persian promise of greatly increased local autonomy for all provided a powerful incentive to cooperate in producing a single text.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=169, 217–18}}

===Structure===
The creation narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the two first chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]].{{sfn|Alter|1981|p=141}} (There are no chapter divisions in the original Hebrew text, see [[Chapters and verses of the Bible]].) The first account (1:1 through 2:3) employs a repetitious structure of divine fiat and fulfillment, then the statement "And there was evening and there was morning, the [''x''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;] day," for each of the six days of creation. In each of the first three days there is an act of division: day one divides the darkness from light, day two the "waters above" from the "waters below", and day three the sea from the land. In each of the next three days these divisions are populated: day four populates the darkness and light with sun, moon and stars; day five populates seas and skies with fish and fowl; and finally land-based creatures and mankind populate the land.{{sfn|Ruiten|2000|pp=9–10}}

[[Wikt:consistency|Consistency]] was evidently not seen as essential to storytelling in ancient Near Eastern literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=9}} "One aspect of narrative in Genesis that requires special attention is its high tolerance for different versions of the same event, a well-known feature of ancient Near Eastern literature, from earliest times through rabbinic midrash. ... This could not have happened if the existence of variation were seen as a serious defect or if rigid consistency were deemed essential to effective storytelling."&lt;/ref&gt; The overlapping stories of Genesis 1 and 2 are contradictory but also complementary, with the first (the Priestly story) concerned with the creation of the entire cosmos while the second (the Yahwist story) focuses on man as moral agent and cultivator of his environment.{{sfn|Alter|1981|p=141}} The highly regimented seven-day narrative of Genesis 1 features an omnipotent God who creates a god-like humanity, while the one-day creation of Genesis 2 uses a simple linear narrative, a God who can fail as well as succeed, and a humanity which is not god-like but is punished for acts which would lead to their becoming god-like.{{sfn|Carr|1996|pp=62–64}} Even the order and method of creation differs.{{sfn|Carr|1996|pp=62–64}} "Together, this combination of parallel character and contrasting profile point to the different origin of materials in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2, however elegantly they have now been combined."{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=64}}

The primary accounts in each chapter are joined by a literary bridge at Genesis 2:4|, "These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created." This echoes the first line of Genesis 1, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth", and is reversed in the next phrase, "...in the day that the {{LORD}} God made the earth and the heavens". This verse is one of ten "generations" ({{lang-he|תולדות}} ''{{transl|he|[[toledot]]}}'') phrases used throughout Genesis, which provide a literary structure to the book.{{sfn|Cross|1973|pp=301ff}} They normally function as headings to what comes after, but the position of this, the first of the series, has been the subject of much debate.{{sfn|Thomas|2011| pp=27–28}}

[[Comparative mythology]] provides historical and cross-cultural perspectives for [[Jewish mythology]]. Both sources behind the Genesis creation narrative borrowed themes from [[Mesopotamian mythology]],{{sfn|Lambert 1965}}{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=9}} but adapted them to [[God in Judaism|their belief in one God]],{{sfn|Sarna|1997|p=50}} establishing a monotheistic creation in opposition to the polytheistic creation myth of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel's]] neighbors.{{sfn|Leeming|2004}}{{sfn|Smith|2001}}

Genesis 1–11 as a whole is imbued with Mesopotamian myths.{{sfn|Lambert 1965}}{{sfn|Kutsko|2000|p=62, quoting J. Maxwell Miller}}  Genesis 1 bears both striking differences from and striking similarities to Babylon's national creation myth, the [[Enuma Elish]].{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=9}} On the side of similarities, both begin from a stage of chaotic waters before anything is created, in both a fixed dome-shaped "firmament" divides these waters from the habitable Earth, and both conclude with the creation of a human called "man" and the building of a temple for the god (in Genesis 1, this temple is the entire cosmos).{{sfn|McDermott|2002|pp=25–27}}  On the side of contrasts, Genesis 1 is [[monotheism|monotheistic]], it makes [[theogony|no attempt to account for the origins of God]], and there is no trace of the resistance to the reduction of chaos to order (Gk. [[theomachy]], lit. "God-fighting"), all of which mark the Mesopotamian creation accounts.{{sfn|Sarna|1997|p=50}} Still, Genesis 1 bears similarities to the [[Baal Cycle]] of Israel's neighbor, [[Ugarit]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|loc=Chapter 6}}

The Enuma Elish has also left traces on Genesis 2. Both begin with a series of statements of what did not exist at the moment when creation began; the Enuma Elish has a spring (in the sea) as the point where creation begins, paralleling the spring (on the land – Genesis 2 is notable for being a "dry" creation story) in Genesis 2:6 that "watered the whole face of the ground"; in both myths, Yahweh/the gods first create a man to serve him/them, then animals and vegetation. At the same time, and as with Genesis 1, the Jewish version has drastically changed its Babylonian model: Eve, for example, seems to fill the role of a [[mother goddess]] when, in Genesis 4:1, she says that she has "created a man with Yahweh", but she is not a divine being like her Babylonian counterpart.{{sfn|Van Seters|1992|pp=122–24}}

Genesis 2 has close parallels with a second Mesopotamian myth, the [[Atra-Hasis]] epic – parallels that in fact extend throughout Genesis 2–11, from the Creation to the [[Noah's ark|Flood]] and its aftermath. The two share numerous plot-details (e.g. the divine garden and the role of the first man in the garden, the creation of the man from a mixture of earth and divine substance, the chance of immortality, etc.), and have a similar overall theme: the gradual clarification of man's relationship with God(s) and animals.{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=64}}

The Garden of Eden story is compared to the [[Sumer]]ian myth in which the goddess [[Ninhursag]] created a beautiful garden full of lush vegetation and fruit trees, called [[Edinu]], in [[Dilmun]], the Sumerian earthly Paradise, a place which the Sumerians believed to exist to the east of their own land, beyond the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Noah Kramer|Kramer, Samuel Noah]]. ''History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}} Ninhursag charged [[Enki]], her lover and half brother, with controlling the wild animals and tending the garden, but Enki became curious about the garden, and his assistant, [[Adapa]], selected seven plants (eight in some versions) and offered them to Enki, who ate them. This enraged Ninhursag, and she caused Enki to fall ill. Enki felt pain in his rib, which is a [[pun]] in Sumerian, as the word "''{{lang|sux|ti}}''" means both "rib" and "life". The other deities persuaded Ninhursag to relent. Ninhursag then created a new goddess (seven or eight to heal his seven or eight ailing organs, including his rib), who was named [[Ninti]], (a name composed of "''{{lang|sux|Nin}}''", or "lady", and "''{{lang|sux|ti}}''", and which may be translated both as "Lady of Living" and "Lady of the Rib"), to cure Enki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|editor1=Charles Russell Coulter |editor2=Patricia Turner }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars suggest that this served as the basis for the story of Eve as "the mother of life" and lady of the rib, created from [[Adam]]'s rib in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name="Meagher 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meagher|first=Robert Emmet|title=The meaning of Helen : in search of an ancient icon|year=1995|publisher=BOLCHAZY-CARDUCCI PUBS (IL)|location=United States|isbn=0865165106}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}

===Creation by word and creation by combat===
The narratives in Genesis 1 and 2 were not the only creation myths in ancient Israel, and the complete biblical evidence suggests two contrasting models.{{sfn|Dolansky|2016}} The first is the "[[logos]]" (meaning speech) model, where a supreme God "speaks" dormant matter into existence. The second is the "[[agon]]" (meaning struggle or combat) model, in which it is God's victory in battle over the monsters of the sea that mark his sovereignty and might.{{sfn|Fishbane|2003|pp=34–35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Graves and Patai|1986}}"Chapter 6"&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis 1 is an example of creation by speech, while [[Psalm 74]] and [[Isaiah 51]] are examples of the "agon" mythology, recalling a Canaanite myth in which God creates the world by vanquishing the water deities: "Awake, awake! ... It was you that hacked Rahab in pieces, that pierced the Dragon! It was you that dried up the Sea, the waters of the great Deep, that made the abysses of the Sea a road that the redeemed might walk..."{{sfn|Hutton|2007|p=274}}

==Genesis 1:1–2:3==
[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[The Ancient of Days]] ([[William Blake]], 1794)]]

===Background===
The cosmos created in Genesis 1 bears a striking resemblance to the [[Tabernacle]] in Exodus 35–40, which was the prototype of the Temple in Jerusalem and the focus of priestly worship of [[Yahweh]]; for this reason, and because other Middle Eastern creation stories also climax with the construction of a temple/house for the creator-god, Genesis 1 can be interpreted as a description of the construction of the cosmos as God's house, for which the Temple in Jerusalem served as the earthly representative.{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=13}}

The word ''bara'' is translated as "created" in English, but the concept it embodied was not the same as the modern term: in the world of the [[ancient Near East]], the gods demonstrated their power over the world not by creating matter but by fixing destinies, so that the essence of the ''bara'' which God performs in Genesis concerns bringing "heaven and earth" (a [[Merism|set phrase]] meaning "everything") into existence by organising and assigning roles and functions.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}}

The use of numbers in ancient texts was often [[Significance of numbers in Judaism|numerological]] rather than factual – that is, the numbers were used because they held some symbolic value to the author.{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=74}} The number seven, denoting divine completion, permeates Genesis 1: verse 1:1 consists of seven words, verse 1:2 of fourteen, and 2:1–3 has 35 words (5x7); Elohim is mentioned 35 times, "heaven/firmament" and "earth" 21 times each, and the phrases "and it was so" and "God saw that it was good" occur 7 times each.{{sfn|Wenham|1987|p=6}}

===Pre-creation: Genesis 1:1–2===
:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness ''[was]'' upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:1–1:2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the opening phrase of [[Genesis 1:1]] is commonly translated in English as above, the Hebrew is [[ambiguous]], and can be translated at least three ways:
# as a statement that the [[cosmos]] had an absolute beginning ("In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.");
# as a statement describing the condition of the world when God began creating ("When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was untamed and shapeless."); and
# essentially similar to the second version but taking all of Genesis 1:2 as background information ("When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the earth being untamed and shapeless, God said, Let there be light!").{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|pp=38–39}}

The second seems to be the meaning intended by the original Priestly author: the verb ''bara'' is used only of God (people do not engage in ''bara''), and it concerns the assignment of roles, as in the creation of the first people as "[[male]] and [[female]]" (i.e., it allocates them [[sexes]]): in other words, the power of God is being shown not by the creation of matter but by the fixing of destinies.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}}

''The heavens and the earth'' is a [[set phrase]] meaning "[[everything]]", i.e., the [[cosmos]]. This was made up of three levels, the habitable earth in the middle, the heavens above, an [[underworld]] below, all [[Cosmic ocean|surrounded by a watery "ocean" of chaos]] as the Babylonian ''[[Tiamat]]''.{{sfn|Spence|2010|p=72}} The earth itself was a flat disc, surrounded by mountains or sea. Above it was the [[firmament]], a transparent but solid dome resting on the mountains, allowing men to see the blue of the waters above, with "windows" to allow the rain to enter, and containing the sun, moon and stars. The waters extended below the earth, which rested on pillars sunk in the waters, and in the underworld was [[Sheol]], the abode of the dead.{{sfn|Knight|1990|pp=175–76}}

The opening of [[Genesis 1]] continues: "And the earth was formless and void..." The phrase "formless and void" is a translation of the Hebrew ''{{transl|he|[[tohu wa-bohu]]}}'', ({{lang-he|תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ}}), chaos, the condition that ''bara'', ordering, remedies.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=}} ''Tohu'' by itself means "emptiness, futility"; it is used to describe the desert wilderness; ''bohu'' has no known meaning and was apparently coined to rhyme with and reinforce ''tohu''.{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=17}} The phrase appears also in Jeremiah 4:23 where the prophet warns Israel that rebellion against God will lead to the return of darkness and chaos, "as if the earth had been 'uncreated'".{{sfn|Thompson|1980|p=230}}

The opening of Genesis 1 concludes with a statement that "''darkness'' was on the face of the ''deep''" ({{lang-he|תְהוֹם}} ''{{transl|he|[[Tehom|t&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;hôm]]}}''), [the] "darkness" and the "deep" being two of the three elements of the [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] represented in ''{{transl|he|[[tohu wa-bohu]]}}'' (the third is the "formless earth"). In the [[Enuma Elish]], the "deep" is personified as the goddess [[Tiamat]], the enemy of [[Marduk]];{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=}} here it is the ''formless body of primeval water surrounding the habitable world'', later to be released during the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], when "all the fountains of the great deep burst forth" from the waters beneath the earth and from the "windows" of the sky.{{sfn|Wenham|2003a|p=29}}

The ''Rûach'' of God moves over the face of the ''deep'' before creation begins. ''Rûach'' ({{lang|he|רוּחַ}}) has the meanings "wind, spirit, breath", and ''{{transl|he|elohim}}'' can mean "great" as well as "god": the ''{{transl|he|ruach elohim}}''  may therefore mean the "wind/breath of God" (the storm-wind is God's breath in Psalms 18:16 and elsewhere, and the wind of God returns in the Flood story as the means by which God restores the earth), or God's "spirit", a concept which is somewhat vague in Hebrew Bible, or it may simply signify a great storm-wind.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|pp=33–34}}

===Six days of Creation: Genesis 1:3–2:3===
[[File:The Creation - Bible Historiale (c.1411), vol.1, f.3 - BL Royal MS 19 D III.jpg|thumbnail|The Creation – [[Bible Historiale]] (c. 1411)]]
God's first act was the creation of undifferentiated light; dark and light were then separated into night and day, their order (evening before morning) signifying that this was the liturgical day; and then the sun, moon and stars were created to mark the proper times for the festivals of the week and year. Only when this is done does God create man and woman and the means to sustain them (plants and animals). At the end of the sixth day, when creation is complete, the world is a cosmic temple in which the role of humanity is the worship of God. This parallels Mesopotamian myth (the ''Enuma Elish'') and also echoes chapter 38 of the [[Book of Job]], where God recalls how the stars, the "sons of God", sang when the corner-stone of creation was laid.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|pp=21–22}}

====First day====
:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
:4 And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:3–1:5|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day 1 begins with the creation of light (and, by implication, time). God creates by spoken command and names the elements of the world as he creates them. In the ancient Near East the act of naming was bound up with the act of creating: thus in Egyptian literature the creator god pronounced the names of everything, and the Enûma Elish begins at the point where nothing has yet been named.{{sfn|Walton|2003|p=158}} God's creation by speech also suggests that he is being compared to a king, who has merely to speak for things to happen.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=39}}

====Second day====
:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which ''[were]'' under the firmament from the waters which ''[were]'' above the firmament: and it was so.
:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:6–1:8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rāqîa‘'', the word translated as [[firmament]], is from ''rāqa‘,'' the verb used for the act of beating metal into thin plates.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|p=122}} Created on the second day of creation and populated by luminaries on the fourth, it is a solid dome which separates the earth below from the heavens and their waters above, as in Egyptian and Mesopotamian belief of the same time.{{sfn|Seeley|1991|p=227}} In Genesis 1:17 the stars are set in the ''raqia‘''; in Babylonian myth the heavens were made of various precious stones (compare Exodus 24:10 where the elders of Israel see God on the sapphire floor of heaven), with the stars engraved in their surface.{{sfn|Walton|2003|pp=158–59}}

====Third day====
:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry ''[land]'' appear: and it was so.
:10 And God called the dry ''[land]'' Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that ''[it was]'' good.
:11 And God said: 'Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth.' And it was so.
:12 And the earth brought forth grass, ''[and]'' herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed ''[was]'' in itself, after his kind: and God saw that ''[it was]'' good.
:13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:9–1:13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the third day, the waters withdraw, creating a ring of ocean surrounding a [[Flat Earth|single circular continent]].{{sfn|Seeley|1997|p=236}} By the end of the third day God has created a foundational environment of light, heavens, seas and earth.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=41}} The three levels of the cosmos are next populated in the same order in which they were created – heavens, sea, earth.

God does not create or make trees and plants, but instead commands the earth to produce them. The underlying theological meaning seems to be that God has given the previously barren earth the ability to produce vegetation, and it now does so at his command. "According to (one's) kind" appears to look forward to the laws found later in the Pentateuch, which lay great stress on holiness through separation.{{sfn|Kissling|2004|p=106}}

====Fourth day====
:14 And God said: ‘Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;
:15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.’ And it was so.
:16 And God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars.
:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
:18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good.
:19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:14–1:19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Day Four the language of "ruling" is introduced: the heavenly bodies will "govern" day and night and mark seasons and years and days (a matter of crucial importance to the Priestly authors, as religious festivals were organised around the cycles of the sun and moon);{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|pp=41–42}} later, man will be created to rule over the whole of creation as God's regent. God puts "lights" in the firmament to "rule over" the day and the night.{{sfn|Walsh|2001|p=37 (fn.5)}}  Specifically, God creates the "greater light," the "lesser light," and the stars.  According to Victor Hamilton, most scholars agree that the choice of "greater light" and "lesser light", rather than the more explicit "sun" and "moon", is anti-mythological rhetoric intended to contradict widespread contemporary beliefs that the sun and the moon were deities themselves.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|p=127}}

====Fifth day====
:20 And God said: ‘Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.’
:21 And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after its kind, and every winged fowl after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
:22 And God blessed them, saying: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.’
:23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. &lt;br&gt;—({{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:20–1:23|HE}})

In the Egyptian and Mesopotamian mythologies, the creator-god has to do battle with the sea-monsters before he can make heaven and earth; in Genesis 1:21, the word ''tannin'', sometimes translated as "sea monsters" or "great creatures", parallels the named [[Chaos (cosmogony)#Chaoskampf|chaos-monsters]] [[Rahab (Egypt)|Rahab]] and [[Leviathan]] from Psalm 74:13, and Isaiah 27:1, and Isaiah 51:9, but there is no hint (in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]) of combat, and the ''tannin'' are simply creatures created by God.{{sfn|Walton|2003|p=160}}

====Sixth day====
[[File:Criação dos Animais (1506-11) - Vasco Fernandes (Museu de Lamego).png|thumb|right|''The Creation of the Animals'' (1506–11), by [[Grão Vasco]]]]
:24 And God said: ‘Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind.’ And it was so.
:25 And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
:26 And God said: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.’
:27 And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.
:28 And God blessed them; and God said unto them: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.’
:29 And God said: ‘Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed—to you it shall be for food;
:30 and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is a living soul, [I have given] every green herb for food.’ And it was so.
:31 And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Genesis|1:24–31|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When in Genesis 1:26 God says "Let us make man", the Hebrew word used is ''adam''; in this form it is a generic noun, "mankind", and does not imply that this creation is male. After this first mention the word always appears as ''ha-adam'', "the man", but as Genesis 1:27 shows ("So God created man in his ''[own]'' image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."), the word is still not exclusively male.{{sfn|Alter|2004|pp=18–19, 21}}

Man was created in the "[[image of God]]". The meaning of this is unclear: suggestions include:
# Having the spiritual qualities of God such as intellect, will, etc.;
# Having the physical form of God;
# A combination of these two;
# Being God's counterpart on earth and able to enter into a relationship with him;
# Being God's representative or viceroy on earth.{{sfn|Kvam et al. 1999|p=24}}

The fact that God says "Let ''us'' make man..." has given rise to several theories, of which the two most important are that "us" is [[majestic plural]],{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=24}} or that it reflects a setting in a [[Divine Council#Hebrew|divine council]] with God enthroned as king and proposing the creation of mankind to the lesser divine beings.{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=14}}

God tells the animals and humans that he has given them "the green plants for food"{{snd}} creation is to be vegetarian. Only later, after the Flood, is man given permission to eat flesh. The Priestly author of Genesis appears to look back to an ideal past in which mankind lived at peace both with itself and with the animal kingdom, and which could be re-achieved through a proper sacrificial life in [[Pre-established harmony|harmony with God]].{{sfn|Rogerson|1991|pp=19ff}}

Upon completion, God sees that "every thing that He had made ... was very good" ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:31|HE}}). This implies that the materials that existed before the Creation ("''[[tohu wa-bohu]]''," "darkness," "''[[tehom]]''") were not "very good." [[Israel Knohl]] hypothesized that the Priestly source set up this dichotomy to mitigate [[the problem of evil]].{{sfn|Knohl|2003|p=13}}

===Seventh day: divine rest===
:1 And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
:2 And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.
:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in creating had made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:1–2:3|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation is followed by rest. In ancient Near Eastern literature the divine rest is achieved in a temple as a result of having brought order to chaos. Rest is both disengagement, as the work of creation is finished, but also engagement, as the deity is now present in his temple to maintain a secure and ordered cosmos.{{sfn|Walton|2006|pp=157–58}} Compare with Exodus 20:8–20:11: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the LORD thy God, in it thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."

==Genesis 2:4–2:25==

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - f 5v.png|thumb|right|200px|Seventh Day of Creation (from the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle)]]
Genesis 2–3, the [[Garden of Eden]] story, was probably authored around 500 BCE as "a discourse on ideals in life, the danger in human glory, and the fundamentally ambiguous nature of humanity – especially human mental faculties".{{sfn|Stordalen|2000|pp=473–74}} The Garden in which the action takes place lies on the mythological border between the human and the divine worlds, probably on the far side of the [[Cosmic ocean]] near the rim of the world; following a conventional ancient Near Eastern concept, the Eden river first forms that ocean and then divides into four rivers which run from the four corners of the earth towards its centre.{{sfn|Stordalen|2000|pp=473–74}}
It opens "in the day that the {{LORD}} God made the earth and the heavens", a set introduction similar to those found in Babylonian myths.{{sfn|Van Seters|1998|p=22}} Before the man is created the earth is a barren waste watered by an ''ed''; Genesis 2:6 the [[King James Version]] translated this as "mist", following Jewish practice, but since the mid-20th century Hebraists have generally accepted that the real meaning is "spring of underground water".{{sfn|Andersen|1987|pp=137–40}}

In Genesis 1 the characteristic word for God's activity is ''bara'', "created"; in Genesis 2 the word used when he creates the man is ''yatsar'', meaning "fashioned", a word used in contexts such as a potter fashioning a pot from clay.{{sfn|Alter|2004|pp=20, 22}} God breathes his own breath into the clay and it becomes ''nephesh'', a word meaning "life", "vitality", "the living personality"; man shares ''nephesh'' with all creatures, but the text describes this life-giving act by God only in relation to man.{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=31}}

Eden, where God puts his [[Garden of Eden]], comes from a root meaning "fertility": the first man is to work in God's miraculously fertile garden.{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=15}} The "tree of life" is a motif from Mesopotamian myth: in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' the hero is given a plant whose name is "man becomes young in old age", but a serpent steals the plant from him.{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=29}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=9}} "The story of Adam and Eve's sin in the garden of Eden (2.25–3.24) displays similarities with Gilgamesh, an epic poem that tells how its hero lost the opportunity for immortality and came to terms with his humanity. ... the biblical narrator has adapted the Mesopotamian forerunner to Israelite theology."&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much scholarly discussion about the type of knowledge given by the second tree. Suggestions include: human qualities, sexual consciousness, ethical knowledge, or universal knowledge; with the last being the most widely accepted.{{sfn|Kooij|2010|p=17}} In Eden, mankind has a choice between wisdom and life, and chooses the first, although God intended them for the second.{{sfn|Propp|1990|p=193}}

The mythic Eden and its rivers may represent the real Jerusalem, the [[Temple of Solomon|Temple]] and the Promised Land. Eden may represent the divine garden on [[Zion]], the mountain of God, which was also Jerusalem; while the real [[Gihon]] was a spring outside the city (mirroring the spring which waters Eden); and the imagery of the Garden, with its serpent and cherubs, has been seen as a reflection of the real images of the Solomonic Temple with its copper serpent (the [[nehushtan]]) and guardian cherubs.{{sfn|Stordalen|2000|pp=307–10}} Genesis 2 is the only place in the Bible where Eden appears as a geographic location: elsewhere (notably in the Book of Ezekiel) it is a mythological place located on the holy Mountain of God, with echoes of a Mesopotamian myth of the king as a primordial man placed in a divine garden to guard the tree of life.{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=33}}

"[[Good and evil]]" is a [[merism]], in this case meaning simply "everything", but it may also have a moral connotation. When God forbids the man to eat from the tree of knowledge he says that if he does so he is "doomed to die": the Hebrew behind this is in the form used in the Bible for issuing death sentences.{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=21}}

The first woman is created to be ''ezer kenegdo'' – a term notably difficult to translate – to the man. ''Kenegdo'' means "alongside, opposite, a counterpart to him", and ''ezer'' means active intervention on behalf of the other person.{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=22}} God's naming of the elements of the cosmos in Genesis 1 illustrated his [[Divinity|authority over creation]]; now the man's naming of the animals (and of Woman) illustrates Adam's authority within creation.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=20}}

The woman is called ''ishah'', "Woman", with an explanation that this is because she was taken from ''ish'', meaning "man"; the two words are not in fact connected. Later, after the story of the Garden is complete, she receives a name: ''Hawwah'' (Eve). This means "living" in Hebrew, from a root that can also mean "snake".{{sfn|Hastings|2003|p=607}} The word traditionally translated "rib" in English can also mean "side", "chamber", or "beam".{{sfn|Jacobs|2007|p=37}} A long-standing exegetical tradition holds that the use of a rib from man's side emphasizes that both man and woman have equal dignity, for woman was created from the same material as man, shaped and given life by the same processes.{{sfn|Hugenberger|1988|p=184}}  Medieval homilies about marriage as a sacrament stated that Eve was made from a more noble material (''the better half'') than Adam;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JqUhR0QZIvEC|title=Geschlechterbeziehungen und Textfunktionen: Studien zu Eheschriften der Frühen Neuzeit|last=Schnell|first=Rüdiger|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=9783110940398|location=|pages=167 ff|language=de|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationism and the genre of Genesis 1–2==
{{creationism2}}{{See also|Literary genre|Myth (disambiguation)|Narrative}}
[[File:Adam and Eve by Lucas Cranach (I).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Eden ([[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1472–1553)]]

The meaning to be derived from the Genesis creation narrative will depend on the reader's understanding of its genre, the literary "type" to which it belongs: "it makes an enormous difference whether the first chapters of Genesis are read as scientific cosmology, creation myth, or historical saga".{{sfn|Wood|1990|pp=323–24}} Misunderstanding of the genre of the text, meaning the intention of the author/s and the culture within which they wrote, will result in a misreading.{{sfn|Andersen|1987|p=142}} [[Calvinism|Reformed]] [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] scholar [[Bruce Waltke]] cautions against one such misreading, the "woodenly literal" approach which leads to "[[creation science]]" and such "implausible interpretations" as the "[[gap theory]]", the presumption of a "[[young earth]]", and the denial of [[evolution]].{{sfn|Waltke|1991|pp=6–9}} Another scholar, [[Conrad Hyers]], sums up the same thought in these words: "A [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] interpretation of the Genesis accounts is inappropriate, misleading, and unworkable [because] it presupposes and insists upon a kind of literature and intention that is not there."{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=28}}

Whatever else it may be, Genesis 1 is "story", since it features character and characterisation, a narrator, and dramatic tension expressed through a series of incidents arranged in time.{{sfn|Cotter|2003|pp=5–9}} The Priestly author of Genesis 1 had to confront two major difficulties. First, there is the fact that since only God exists at this point, no-one was available to be the narrator; the storyteller solved this by introducing an unobtrusive "third person narrator".{{sfn|Cotter|2003|p=7}} Second, there was the problem of conflict: conflict is necessary to arouse the reader's interest in the story, yet with nothing else existing, neither a chaos-monster nor another god, there cannot be any conflict. This was solved by creating a very minimal tension: God is opposed by nothingness itself, the blank of the world "without form and void."{{sfn|Cotter|2003|p=7}} Telling the story in this way was a deliberate choice: there are a number of creation stories in the Bible, but they tend to be told in the first person, by Wisdom, the instrument by which God created the world; the choice of [[Narrative mode#Third-person, omniscient|omniscient third-person narrator]] in the Genesis narrative allows the storyteller to create the impression that everything is being told and nothing held back.{{sfn|Cotter|2003|p=8}}

It can also be regarded as ancient history, "part of a broader spectrum of originally anonymous, history-like ancient Near Eastern narratives."{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=21}} It is frequently called myth in scholarly writings, but there is no agreement on how "myth" is to be defined, and so while [[Brevard Childs]] famously suggested that the author of Genesis 1–11 "demythologised" his narrative, meaning that he removed from his sources (the Babylonian myths) those elements which did not fit with his own faith, others can say it is entirely mythical.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|pp=57–58}}

Genesis 1–2 can be seen as ancient science: in the words of [[E.A. Speiser]], "on the subject of creation biblical tradition aligned itself with the traditional tenets of Babylonian science."{{sfn|Seidman|2010|p=166}} The opening words of Genesis 1, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", sum up the author(s) belief that [[Yahweh]], the god of Israel, was solely responsible for creation and had no rivals.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=53}} Later Jewish thinkers, adopting ideas from Greek philosophy, concluded that [[Wisdom of God|God's Wisdom]], [[Logos|Word]] and [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)|Spirit]] penetrated all things and gave them unity.{{sfn|Kaiser|1997|p=28}}  Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and identified [[Jesus]] with the [[Logos (Christianity)|creative word]]: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" ([[John 1:1]]).{{sfn|Parrish|1990|pp=183–84}} When the Jews came into contact with Greek thought it led to a major reinterpretation of the underlying cosmology of the Genesis narrative. The biblical authors conceived the cosmos as a flat disc-shaped earth in the centre, an underworld for the dead below, and heaven above.{{sfn|Aune|2003|p=119}} Below the earth were the "waters of chaos", the cosmic sea, home to mythic monsters defeated and slain by God; in Exodus 20:4, God warns against making an image "of anything that is in the waters under the earth".{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=53}} There were also waters above the earth, and so the ''raqia'' ([[firmament]]), a solid bowl, was necessary to keep them from flooding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryken et al|1998|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Hellenistic period this was largely replaced by a more "scientific" model as imagined by Greek philosophers, according to which the earth was a sphere at the centre of concentric shells of celestial spheres containing the sun, moon, stars and planets.{{sfn|Aune|2003|p=119}}

The idea that God created the world out of nothing (''creatio [[ex nihilo]]'') is central today to Islam, Christianity, and Judaism – indeed, the medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared{{sfn|Soskice|2010|p=24}} – yet it is not found directly in Genesis, nor in the entire Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Nebe|2002|p=119}} The Priestly authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}} This was still the situation in the early 2nd century AD, although early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God; by the beginning of the 3rd century this tension was resolved, world-formation was overcome, and creation ''ex nihilo'' had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.{{sfn|May|2004|p=179}}

'''John Alexander Noble''' (1913–1983) was an artist known for creating drawings, paintings, and lithographs of ships and harbors around New York City.

==Early life==
Noble was born in Paris, France, in 1913. The son of painter [[John Noble (painter)|John Noble]], he moved to the United States with his family in 1919. About 1929, he started drawing and painting. While in school he was a "permanent fixture" on the McCarren line tugs, which towed schooners in New York Harbor. In the summer, he would go to sea. In 1931, he graduated from [[Friends Seminary]] and returned to France, where he studied for a year at the [[Université Grenoble Alpes|University of Grenoble]] and met his wife, Susan Ames. When he returned to New York, he studied for a year at the [[National Academy Museum and School|National Academy of Design]].&lt;ref name="Noble Collection Bio"&gt;{{cite web |title=John A. Noble |url=http://www.noblemaritime.org/john-a-noble/ |website=The Noble Maritime Collection |access-date=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1928 to 1945, Noble worked as a seaman on schooners and in marine salvage in New York Harbor. When he saw the [[Port Johnston Coal Docks]] on the [[Kill van Kull]], which had become a "great boneyard" of wooden sailing vessels, the sight of it "affected him for life". In 1941, he began to build a floating, "houseboat" studio there, made out of salvaged ship parts. From 1946, he worked as an artist full-time, voyaging through New York Harbor in a rowboat and creating—in oil paintings, charcoal drawings, sketches and lithographs—a "unique and exacting record" of the "characters, industries, and vessels" of the harbor.&lt;ref name="Noble Collection Bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimesMcgill19830606" /&gt;

==Death==
Noble died in May 1983. His wife had died earlier that year. At a memorial service at the [[Sailors' Snug Harbor|Snug Harbor Cultural Center]] three weeks later, 200 people, including Staten Island borough president [[Anthony Gaeta]] and Noble's two sons, spoke in remembrance. A fire boat shot plumes of water and tugboats sounded their horns.&lt;ref name="NYTimesMcgill19830606"&gt;{{cite news |last=McGill |first=Douglas C. |title=Artist Remembered at Harbor He Loved |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/06/nyregion/artist-rememered-at-harbor-he-loved.html |date=June 6, 1983 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle and 11th Baron Morley by John de Critz.jpg|thumb|[[William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle]]. Attributed to John de Critz, c.1615.]]

'''John de Critz''' or '''John Decritz''' (1551/2 – 14 March 1642 (buried)) was one of a number of painters of Flemish and Dutch origin active at the English royal court during the reigns of [[James I of England]] and [[Charles I of England]]. He held the post of [[Serjeant Painter]] to the king from 1603, at first jointly with Leonard Fryer and from 1610 jointly with [[Robert Peake the Elder]].

De Critz was born in [[Antwerp]].  His Flemish parents brought him as a boy to England from [[Antwerp]], during the [[Habsburg]] persecution of Dutch Protestants, and apprenticed him to the artist and poet [[Lucas de Heere]], also from Antwerp, who may have taught members of the  [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger|Gheeraerts]] family and [[Robert Peake the elder|Robert Peake]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=415&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio Tate Collection (article on Robert Peake from Grove Art Online).] Retrieved 2 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; De Critz established himself as an independent artist by the late 1590s,
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bergercollection.org/artist_detail.php?i=4) Berger Collection.] Retrieved 31 May 2007.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928054607/http://www.bergercollection.org/artist_detail.php?i=4%29 |date=28 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1603 he was appointed serjeant-painter to the king.

De Critz's work, traced through his bills, also entailed the restoration of decorative detail, the painting and guilding of royal coaches and barges, and individual tasks such as painting the signs and letters on a royal sun-dial.&lt;ref name = "Gaunt"&gt;William Gaunt, ''Court Painting in England from Tudor to Victorian Times'', London: Constable, 1980, {{ISBN|0-09-461870-4}}; p 53.&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted "bravely" for court [[masques]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated366"&gt;[[Horace Walpole]], ''Anecdotes of Painting in England: With Some Account of the Principal Artists, and Notes on other Arts, Collected by the Late George Vertue. Digested and Published from his Original MSS, Vol II.'' London: Henry. G. Bohn, 1849 edition; p 366.&lt;/ref&gt; dramatic spectaculars which required elaborate scenery and scenic effects.&lt;ref name="autogenerated365"&gt;[[Horace Walpole]], ''Anecdotes of Painting in England: With Some Account of the Principal Artists, and Notes on other Arts, Collected by the Late George Vertue. Digested and Published from his Original MSS, Vol II.'' London: Henry. G. Bohn, 1849 edition; p 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
De Critz's father was Troilus de Critz, a [[goldsmith]] from [[Antwerp]].  John de Critz's sister Magdalena married [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]], another Flemish court painter, who may also have been a pupil of de Heere.  De Critz was succeeded as Serjeant Painter by his son John the Younger (b. before 1599), who had been involved in the work for many years—his father died at about 90.  John the Younger was killed shortly afterwards in the fighting at Oxford.  Other painters from the family include John the Elder's sons Emmanuel (1608–65), who also worked for the court, and Thomas (1607–53), to whom many portraits of their [[John Tradescant the elder|Tradescant]] relations are now attributed.&lt;ref&gt;Some of those in the Ashmolean Museum were attributed to Emmanuel in their 1989 catalogue, and to Thomas in the 2004 edition ''The Ashmolean Museum: Complete Illustrated Catalogue of Paintings'', p. 305, 2006, Catherine Casley, Colin Harrison, Jon Whiteley.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas also worked for the Crown between 1629 and 1637.&lt;ref&gt;Ashmolean Catalogue, p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;  Oliver de Critz (1626–51) was a son of John the Younger by his third wife; his portrait in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] may be a self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/critz-john-de Oxford Dictionary of Art], Ashmolean Catalogue, p. 34; Ellis Waterhouse, "Painting in Britain, 1530-1790", pp.77-8, 4th Edn, 1978, Penguin Books (now Yale History of Art series)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serjeant Painter==
The post of serjeant-painter came into being with the appointment of John Browne in 1511–12, and the last known holder was James Stewart, of whom no records are available after 1782, though it is not clear whether the post was ever actually abolished.&lt;ref name = "Burl"&gt;"The Serjeant-Painters" (unsigned editorial), in ''The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 84, No. 493'', April 1944, p 81.&lt;/ref&gt; In a patent issued on 7 May 1679 for [[Robert Streater]], a list of previous serjeant-painters is given, including "John Decreetz &amp; Robert Peake" as joint-holders of the post.&lt;ref name="Burl"/&gt; De Critz was given the post in 1603 but is first described as sharing the office with Leonard Fryer, who had held it since 1595. [[Robert Peake the Elder]] was appointed jointly with de Critz in 1607,&lt;ref name = "Ed"&gt;Mary Edmond, "New Light on Jacobean Painters", in
''The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 118, No. 875'', February 1976, pp 74–83.&lt;/ref&gt; or 1610.&lt;ref name="Burl"/&gt; A payment made to de Critz in 1633 shows that he was paid a retainer of £40 a year.&lt;ref name="autogenerated366"/&gt; For three portraitss made in 1606, of the King, Prince Henry, and Anne of Denmark, to be sent to the ambassador in Austria, de Critz was paid £53 six shillings and eight pence.&lt;ref&gt;Devon, Frederick, ed., ''Issues of the Exchequer in the Reign of James I'', London (1836), p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anne of Denmark-1605.jpg|thumb|[[Anne of Denmark]]. John de Critz, c.1605.]]

The role of the serjeant painter was elastic in its definition of duties: it involved not just the painting of original portraits but of their reproductions in new versions, to be sent to other courts (King James, unlike Elizabeth, was markedly averse to sitting for his portrait)&lt;ref name = "Gaunt2"&gt;William Gaunt, ''Court Painting in England from Tudor to Victorian Times'', London: Constable, 1980, {{ISBN|0-09-461870-4}}; p 52.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as copying and restoring portraits by other painters in the [[Royal Collection|royal collection]], and many decorative tasks, for example scene painting and the painting of banners.

[[Horace Walpole]] provided information about some of the tasks de Critz performed in his ''Anecdotes of Painting in England'', which he based closely on the notes of [[George Vertue]], who had met acquaintances of de Critz and his family. In particular, Walpole quoted from a scrap of paper, a "memorandum in his own hand", on which de Critz wrote bills for jobs completed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated365"/&gt; On one side was his bill for work on a sun-dial:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For several times oyling and laying with fayre white a stone for a sun-dyall opposite to some part of the king and queen’s lodgings, the lines thereof being drawn in severall colours, the letters directing to the bowers guilded with fine gould, as alsoe the glory, and a scrowle guilded with fine gould, whereon the number and figures specifying the planetary howers are inscribed; likewise certain letters drawne in black informing in what part of the compasse the sun at any time there shining shall be resident; the whole worke being circumferenced with a frett painted in a manner of a stone one, the compleat measure of the whole being six foote.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other side is a demand for payment for work on the royal barge:

&lt;blockquote&gt;John De Critz demaundeth allowance for these parcells of Worke following, viz. For repayreing, refreshing, washing and varnishing the whole body of his Majesty’s privy barge, and mending with fine gould and faire colours many and divers parts thereof, as about the chaire of state, the doores, and most of the antiques about the windowes, that had bene galled and defaced, the two figures at the entrance being most new coloured and painted, the Mercury and the lion that are fixed to the sternes of this and the row barge being in several places repayred both with gould and colours, as also the taffarils on the top of the barge in many parts guilded and strowed with fayre byse. The two figures of Justice and Fortitude most an end {{sic}} being quite new painted and guilded. The border on the outside of the bulk being new layd with faire white and trayled over with greene according to the custom heretofore—and for baying and colouring the whole number of the oares for the row barge being thirty-six.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John de Critz's final bill for painting these barges and their carvings by [[Maximilian Colt]] in 1621 was over £255.&lt;ref&gt;Devon, Frederick, ed., ''Issues of the Exchequer in the Reign of James I'', London (1836), p.276, 289&lt;/ref&gt; Walpole also noted that de Critz painted a gilded "middle piece" for a ceiling at [[Oatlands Palace]] and repaired pictures, and he quoted a wardrobe account for work on the royal carriages: "To John De Critz, serjeant-painter, for painting and gilding with good gold the body and carriages of two coaches and the carriage of one chariot and other necessaries, 179''l''.3''s''.4''d''. ''anno'' 1634."&lt;ref name="autogenerated366"/&gt;  De Critz also gilded [[Maximilian Colt| Maximilian Colt's]] marble effigy for the tomb of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], completed in 1606, which had been painted by [[Nicholas Hilliard]]. All traces of the painting and gilding have now disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alison Weir]], ''Elizabeth the Queen'', London: Pimlico, (1998) 1999 edition, {{ISBN|0-7126-7312-1}}; p 486.&lt;/ref&gt;

Walpole said of de Critz that "His life is to be collected rather from office-books than from his works or his reputation"; and the comparative mundanity of some of the tasks he undertook has led to a downplaying of the artistic role of the serjeant-painter. Art historian William Gaunt describes de Critz's role as "mainly that of a handyman".&lt;ref name="Gaunt"/&gt; A [[Burlington Magazine]] editorial remarked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A great deal of easy fun has been poked at the institution of the serjeant-painters, because these had to attend to tasks such as downright house-painting, the painting of barges and coaches, the provision of banners and streamers, and so on.&lt;ref name = "Burl"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Life and work==
[[File:James I, VI by John de Critz, c.1606.png|thumb| left|James I. Attributed to John de Critz, c. 1606]]

It is not certain in precisely which part of London de Critz had his studio, but it is known that he moved to the parish of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] before his death in 1642.&lt;ref name="Ed"/&gt; He stated in his will that he had previously lived for thirty years in the parish of [[St Andrew, Holborn]]. Horace Walpole notes George Vertue's comment that there were three rooms full of the king’s pictures at de Critz’s house in Austin-friars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Walpole]], ''Anecdotes of Painting in England: With Some Account of the Principal Artists, and Notes on other Arts, Collected by the Late George Vertue. Digested and Published from his Original MSS, Vol II.'' London: Henry. G. Bohn, 1849 edition; p 367.&lt;/ref&gt; De Critz is entered in a subsidy roll for the parish of [[St Sepulchre-without-Newgate]] in 1607 and again in 1625; and since this parish adjoins St Andrew, Holborn, he possibly had his studio in St Sepulchre.&lt;ref name="Ed"/&gt;  He died in [[London]] in 1642; the exact date is unknown.

Although de Critz was a prolific painter, few of his works have been clearly identified. The portrait painters of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period present peculiar difficulties in this respect, since they often made multiple versions not only of their own paintings but of those of their predecessors and contemporaries, and they rarely signed their work. In addition, portraits by different artists often share poses or iconographical features. Although many paintings are attributed to de Critz, therefore, full authentication is unusual. The noted art historian and critic [[John Rothenstein|Sir John Rothenstein]] summed up the problems:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To make definitive attributions is a difficult undertaking. This is due to a variety of causes, the most important being the practice of successful painters of employing assistants. Another confusing factor is the tendency on the part of members of the artistic families to intermarry with one another; Marc Gheeraerts the elder and his son and namesake, for example, both married sisters of John de Critz. Similarities of style were also encouraged by legislation, and painters were for a time forbidden to portray the Queen pending the painting of a portrait such as might be taken as a model to be copied.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Rothenstein]], ''An Introduction to English Painting'', I.B.Tauris, 2001 edition, {{ISBN|1-86064-678-6}}; p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As part of the monarchy's advancement of its political and dynastic aims, numerous copies of standard portraits were required for presentation as gifts and transmission to foreign embassies.&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Ungerer, "Juan Pantoja de la Cruz and the Circulation of Gifts Between the English and Spanish Courts in 1604/5", in ''Shakespeare Studies'', ed. John Leeds Barroll, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8386-3782-5}}; p 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Gustav Ungerer has studied the interchanges of portraits, jewellery and other gifts during the negotiations and celebrations which surrounded the [[Treaty of London (1604)|Treaty of London]], a peace treaty signed with Spain in August 1604 during the conference at [[Somerset House]], when diplomatic exchanges of miniatures and full-length portraits took place in a sustained show of brilliant self-representation.&lt;ref&gt;"The prestige of painting played as important a role as the splendor of the court celebrations or the codified ritual of gift exchange." Ungerer, p 145&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, Ungerer discusses the contested authorship of the famous painting of the two sets of negotiators sitting opposite each other at the conference table, ''The Somerset House Conference'', a work in which John de Critz may have had a hand, either directly or as a source for the copying of figures.

[[File:Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury by John De Critz the Elder (2).jpg| thumb| [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]], later 1st earl of Salisbury. Attributed to John de Critz, 1602.]]

Both versions of the painting—one at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery]] and one at the [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich—are signed by the Spanish court painter [[Juan Pantoja de la Cruz]]; but scholars disagree about whether he was in fact the artist since, although the signatures appear authentic, he was never in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilbert-collection.org.uk/previous_exhibitions/1604/index.html Notes for the Gilbert Collection exhibition "Talking Peace 1604: The Somerset House Conference Paintings",  20 May 2004 – 20 July 2004.] Retrieved 3 June 2007; Gustav Ungerer argues that Pantoja may have visited London with the Spanish delegation. See Gustav Ungerer, "Juan Pantoja de la Cruz and the Circulation of Gifts Between the English and Spanish Courts in 1604/5", in ''Shakespeare Studies'', ed. John Leeds Barroll, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8386-3782-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that either the works are by a Flemish artist, possibly [[Frans Pourbus the younger|Frans Pourbus]], or John De Critz, or were copied by Pantoja from a Flemish artist who was in London at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilbert-collection.org.uk/previous_exhibitions/1604/index.html |title=Notes for the Gilbert Collection exhibition "Talking Peace 1604: The Somerset House Conference Paintings", 20 May 2004 – 20 July 2004 |publisher=Gilbert-collection.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pantoja may have worked up the likenesses of the English negotiators by "copying the faces of the delegates either from miniatures or from standard portraits given to him or to the constable in London or sent to Valladolid...He obviously used a Cecil portrait as model for ''The Somerset House Conference'' which was Cecil's standard type of portrait attributed to John de Critz".&lt;ref name="Ungerer, p 173"&gt;Ungerer, p 173.&lt;/ref&gt; It is certainly on record that the leader of the English negotiating team, [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]], gave the leader of the Spanish negotiators, [[Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías]] and Constable of Castile, his stock portrait as duplicated in the workshop of John de Critz.&lt;ref&gt;Ungerer, p 154. Pantoja had his studio at [[Valladolid]], then the Spanish royal capital.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pantoja's depiction of [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Charles Howard, earl of Nottingham]], also looks as if it has been duplicated from a standard portrait. Apart from the heads, the picture shows signs of workshop painting by assistants, perhaps revealing that numerous versions were produced, as there would have been many demands from those involved for duplicates of the painting, for purposes of historical record.&lt;ref name="Ungerer, p 173"/&gt; The painting sheds light on the piecemeal process of constructing group portraits at this time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19118">'''Keren Cytter''' (born 22 August 1977) is an Israeli visual artist and writer.

==Biography==
Cytter, born [[22 August]] 1977, spent her childhood in Israel and went on to study visual arts at the [[Avni Institute of Art and Design]], [[Tel Aviv]].  After finding success in various galleries in her home country, she moved to Amsterdam on a scholarship from [[De Ateliers]] where she studied with [[Willem de Rooij]] and [[Marlene Dumas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nogagallery.com/Artists/keren-cytter/About.html ''Keren Cytter biography'']. Noga Gallery&lt;/ref&gt; Her scope of work includes film, video installations, performance, drawings and photography. She is also a writer of novels, theatre plays and poetry.

==Work==

===Video Art===
Cytter is best known for her textually based video art. Her narratives, although extremely fragmented, have a tendency to embody the [[post-modern]] self-awareness of the characters in her films. Through the development and execution of Cytter's unique style, she has found herself a niche in the art world which has brought her more and more critical attention and made her one of the most renowned artists of her generation.

After graduating from De ateliers in Amsterdam, Cytter made several works which went on to be shown internationally including ''The Date Series'' (2004, a series of short narratives written, filmed and produced in the period of one year), ''The Victim'' (2006), ''Repulsion'' (2005, based on [[Polanski]]'s [[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]),  and ''The Milk Man'' (2003). Among her most famous work is ''Der Spiegel'' from 2007. In just one long shot she stages a Shakespearean drama in a stripped contemporary Berlin apartment in which a middle-aged woman is forced to confront the realities of her fading sexual attractiveness by a sadistic pair of younger women. ''Four Seasons'' (2009) is another example of essential Cytter: the absurdist low-fi mixture of a variety of film genres, from [[Film noir]] to [[Melodrama]], culminates in the iconic shot of a burning Christmas tree set to the dramatic music of [[Ferrante &amp; Teicher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://schauort.com/cytter-four-seasons.htm ''Keren Cytter - Four Seasons'']. Schau Ort.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance and Theatre===
In 2008 Cytter formed a dance company called D.I.E NOW (Dance International Europe Now) consisting of 5 non-professional dancers. Their first production ''History in the Making - The True Story of John Webber'', which was based on a wide range of influences including [[Pina Bausch]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Disney on Ice]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Yvonne Rainer]] and the 1980s dance-floor filler [[Lambada]], went on an international tour and was presented in [[Tate Modern]]'s [[Turbine Hall]] in London, [[The Kitchen]] in New York City, Tramway in Glasgow and [[Hebbel am Ufer]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://moussemagazine.it/articolo.mm?id=487 ''Keren Cytter on D.I.E NOW''] Mousse Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textezurkunst.de/daily/2010/mar/05/christine-regus-uber-keren-cytter-im-hau-berlin/ ''Keren Cytter at HAU Berlin''] Texte zur Kunst&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year the British magazine [[Art Review]] ran a cover story on her entitled "I just wanted to attract attention".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1256764/Texts/Cytter_Art%20Review_April09.pdf ''Keren Cytter Portrait ''] Art Review&lt;/ref&gt;

She initiated her foundation APE - ''art projects era'' together with Dutch curator Maaike Gouwenberg in 2010. The aim of the organization is to develop projects (performances, exhibitions, printed matter, meetings) that cannot necessarily be realized within traditional institutional formats or frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artprojectsera.org/about ''About APE'']. art projects era&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year she wrote and directed the play ''Show Real Drama'', produced by APE and partly based on the lives of its two actors, Susanne Meyer and [[Fabian Stumm]]. In the piece, which uses videos and repetitive dialogue and movements creating a fractured yet empathetic storyline, they are struggling with the demanding entertainment business while their relationship is slowly falling apart. The production met with great success, the [[Houston Chronicle]] calling it "intriguing (...) something deconstructionist architect [[Frank Gehry]] might conjure if he were a playwright; a story pulled apart at the seams then re-configured with cool wit and 21st-century angst." As of 2014, the play has been performed all around the world from London, New York City and Houston to Shanghai, Beijing and Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artprojectsera.org/projects/show-real-drama ''Show Real Drama''] art projects era&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/Show-Real-Drama-intrigues-at-DiverseWorks-3940661.php ''Show Real Drama Review''] Houston Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tip-berlin.de/kultur-und-freizeit-theater-und-buehne/kreative-der-krise ''Show Real Drama Review''] Tip Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2010 her work was featured on the cover of the American Art Magazine [[Artforum]], which ran an extensive story on her body of work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artiscontemporary.org/features_detail.php?id=116 ''True Lies - The Art of Keren Cytter''] Artis Contemporary/Artforum&lt;/ref&gt;

Her next play ''Anke is Gone'' or ''I Eat Pickles At Your Funeral'' opened in Berlin at [[Hebbel am Ufer]] in 2011 and was invited to the [[Images Festival]] Toronto in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesfestival.com/calendar.php?event_id=792&amp;month=n ''Keren Cytter''] Images Festival&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Cytter collaborated with musicians Keira Fox, Charlie Feinstein and David Aird on ''Vociferous'', a fluid combination of musical concert, video work and performance which was presented at the ICA [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|Institute of Contemporary Art]], London. Adrian Searle wrote in his [[The Guardian]] review: "As a mix of live performance and video, the recent collaboration between [[Adam Curtis]] and [[Massive Attack]] at the [[Manchester International Festival]] set a standard. Vociferous is both more intimate, more alienating, and more of a mash-up (...) After a bit I gave up trying to follow anything like a story, if there was one, or to chase the projected imagery, which came and went intermittently, first on one screen, then another. I felt a bit of a berk, running through the crowd with a notebook, trying to keep up, like an undercover cop blowing my own cover. Towards the end, Fox and Feinstein take up the electronic drums, and Fox starts singing from a ragged sheet of lyrics, the music hitting such a pitch that my nostril-hairs start to vibrate in sympathy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/06/artist-keren-cytter-vociferous ''Keren Cytter's Vociferous''] The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent projects===
After six years in Berlin, Cytter relocated to New York City in 2012 where she initiated a quarterly publication focusing on art and poetry. Published by APE, it has so far featured Nora Schultz, John Kelsey and writings of Josef Strau, [[Matthew Dickman]], Roman Baembaev, Roger van Voorhees and Sylvia Mae Gorelick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artprojectsera.org/publications/ ''Publications''] art projects era&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 2013 solo exhibition at Pilar Corrias Gallery in London presented an ambitious new body of work called MOP (''Museum of Photography'') - a large archive of [[Polaroid film|Polaroid]] photographs documenting her life as she travelled from Berlin and London, to the United States and Israel from 2012 to 2013. Taken with her 1200i and One step 600 [[Polaroid camera]], the photographs are carefully categorised by geography and chronology and then arranged into sub-sections, titled A, B, C and D and so on, via their aesthetic. Images of friends, colleagues, curators she encountered, museums she worked in, landscapes she passed through, and her own performances are all featured. The collection consists of more than 800 polaroids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/3123/Keren_Cytter_and_her_800_Polaroids ''Keren Cytter and her 800 polaroids''] Another Mag&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
In addition to her video and performance work, Cytter is also a critically acclaimed writer. Next to her three novels ''The Man Who Climbed the Stairs of Life and Found Out They Were Cinema Seats'' (2005), ''The Seven Most Exciting Hours of Mr. Trier’s Life in Twenty-Four Chapters'' (2008) and ''The Amazing True Story of Moshe Klinberg – A Media Star'' (2009), she has published poems as well as excerpts of her diary called ''White Diaries'' in 2010. She also wrote the libretto for the [[chamber opera]] ''Le Voisin'' by Thomas Myrmel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nagel-draxler.de/artists/keren-cytter/ ''Keren Cytter Bibliography''] Nagel Draxler Gallery&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22171">The '''100 Books of the Century''' ({{lang-fr|Les cent livres du siècle}}) is a list of the one hundred best books of the 20th century, according to a poll conducted in the spring of 1999 by the French retailer [[Fnac]] and the Paris newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]''.

Starting from a preliminary list of 200 titles created by bookshops and journalists, 17,000 French voters responded to the question, "Which books have remained in your memory?" (''Quels livres sont restés dans votre mémoire ?'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=46796 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120527083227/http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=46796 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 May 2012 |title=Écrivains et choix sentimentaux |trans-title=Authors and sentimental choices |first=Josyane |last=Savigneau |author-link=Josyane Savigneau |newspaper=Le Monde |language=French |date=15 October 1999 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of acclaimed titles mixes great novels with poetry and theatre, as well as the [[Asterix the Gaul |Asterix]] comic book. The list includes many [[French novels]] because of the demographics of the surveyed group. However, similar lists by English language sources include US and UK authors only (for example, the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels]] published in 1998, with two lists, one by the Board of the Modern Library and the other by readers who responded).

The '''Louisville Ballet''' is a [[ballet]] school and company based in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] and is the official state ballet of The Commonwealth of [[Kentucky]]. It is currently led by Artistic and Executive Director Robert Curran. More than 100,000 people attend the company's productions annually of which most are accompanied by the [[Louisville Orchestra]]. The company performs at three venues in the city, The Brown Theatre, [[The Kentucky Center]], and, rarely, [[The Louisville Palace]].

The Louisville Ballet was founded in 1952 and it achieved professional status and admitted its first students in 1975. It is the only regional company with which [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] has performed in repertoire productions (He danced with the company during the 1978–79 and 1979–80 seasons). The Ballet has more than 60 world premieres to its credit with a repertoire of about 150 pieces choreographed by the likes of [[Frederick Ashton|Sir Frederick Ashton]], [[Erik Bruhn]], [[George Balanchine]], [[Antony Tudor]], [[John Cranko]], [[Jack Carter (choreographer)|Jack Carter]], [[Kurt Jooss]], [[Gho Choo San|Choo San Goh]], [[José Limón|Jose Limon]], [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], David Parsons, Eugene Loring, Saeko Ichinohe and Domy Reiter-Soffer, along with Fokine and Bournonville ballets. The Ballet also presents several full length ballets each year including [[Swan Lake]], [[Sleeping Beauty|The Sleeping Beauty]], Coppelia, [[Romeo and Juliet]], Cinderella, Giselle and [[Don Quixote]]. In addition to the regular subscription series, the Louisville Ballet presents [[The Nutcracker]] each [[Winter holiday season|holiday season]] in association with the [[Brown-Forman Corporation]].

The Louisville Ballet building, designed by Louisville architects Bravura Corporation, is a $2.2 million facility built in 1995 houses two large rehearsal studios and administrative offices. The Louisville Ballet Center received the Honor Award for Excellence in Architectural Design by the Kentucky chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] and was featured in the May 1997 edition of Architecture Magazine. It is located at 315 East Main St. in [[downtown Louisville]].

The Louisville Ballet School is the official school and training center connected with the Louisville Ballet. The Louisville Ballet Youth Ensemble is the student performing group of the School. Alumni of the Ensemble have gone on to dance professionally with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Ailey II, American Ballet Theatre, Aspen Santa Fe Ballet, Ballet Magnificat!, Barcelona Ballet (formerly Corella Ballet), Boston Ballet II, Colorado Ballet, Ft. Wayne Ballet, Houston Ballet, Louisville Ballet, Missouri Ballet Theatre, New York City Ballet, Peridance and Sarasota Ballet, and those who have continued their dance education at NYU, Fordham (Ailey), Butler University, Florida State, University of Arizona, Ohio State University, Pointe Park University and Southern Methodist University. Many students also went on to study with professional training programs including Boston Ballet, Harid Conservatory, Next Generation Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, San Francisco Ballet and the [[School of American Ballet]]. The school also hosts a [[summer camp]] for aspiring dancers.

'''Meteodyn WT''', commonly known as '''Meteodyn''' is a [[wind energy software]] program that uses [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) to conduct [[wind resource assessment]]. Developed and marketed by Meteodyn, Meteodyn WT was first released in September 2009. The software quantifies the wind resource in a desired terrain in order to assess the feasibility of a proposed [[wind farm]]. The software’s objective is to design the most profitable [[wind farm]]. This is achieved by taking into account the measured wind data at a [[measurement tower]] and the terrain conditions. Both of these are essential to be able to obtain the wind conditions and therefore the wind resources of the desired terrain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://meteodyn.com/en/logiciels/cfd-wind-farm-resource-software-meteodynwt/#.Wruydy5ubX4|title=Meteodyn WT software - Wind resource assessment software|work=Meteodyn|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.environmental-expert.com/software/meteodyn-wt-cfd-software-for-wind-resource-assessment-116427|title=Meteodyn WT - CFD Software for Wind Resource Assessment by Meteodyn {{!}} Environmental XPRT|website=www.environmental-expert.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/MeteoDyn_FAQ|title=MeteoDyn FAQ -- CFD-Wiki, the free CFD reference|website=www.cfd-online.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meteodyn WT has been validated with actual wind measurements by independent studies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pereira|first=R|last2=Guedes|first2=Ricardo|last3=Silva Santos|first3=Carlos|date=2010-01-01|title=Comparing WAsP and CFD wind resource estimates for the "regular" user|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266067580_Comparing_WAsP_and_CFD_wind_resource_estimates_for_the_regular_user}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Díaz|first=Carlos|last2=Mancebo|first2=Asensio|last3=Uzunoglu|first3=Bahri|date=2014-03-10|title=COMPARISON STUDY FOR TWO COMMERCIAL WIND RESOURCE ANALYSIS CFD SOFTWARE FOR AN EMBANKMENT|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280080646_COMPARISON_STUDY_FOR_TWO_COMMERCIAL_WIND_RESOURCE_ANALYSIS_CFD_SOFTWARE_FOR_AN_EMBANKMENT|doi=10.13140/RG.2.1.3249.7129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meteodyn WT is used by [[wind turbine]] manufacturers, wind farm developers, [[Consulting firm|consulting firms]] and wind farm operators.

== Graphical user interface ==
The current version of Meteodyn WT displays all projects in one world map; this map already includes terrain and [[Roughness length|roughness]] data.

== Features ==
Meteodyn WT features a geographical data management tool, a meteorological data processing tool, a LIDAR correction tool, a [[wind turbine]] creation tool, a wind turbines micro-siting tool, a wind atlas tool and an auto-convergence tool.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It also includes the following functions: wind resource mapping, [[wake]] effect computation, annual energy production (AEP) with / without wake effect, directional [[wind shear]] at each turbine, wind and [[turbulence]] matrices at each turbine, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] compliance, automatic report generation, losses and uncertainties.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://meteodyn.com/en/wind-resource-assessment/#.Wru7LC5ubX4|title=What is wind resource assessment ?|work=Meteodyn|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compatibility with other software ==
The current version of Meteodyn WT exports to the following wind energy software formats: .wrg, .rsf, .wrb, .fmv and Flowres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://meteodyn.com/en/logiciels/meteodyn-wt-rg-modelling-wind-resource-grid/#.Wru77y5ubX4|title=meteodyn WT RG - Wind resource grid|work=Meteodyn|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Earth|Google earth]] and [http://www.goldensoftware.com/products/surfer Surfer] export formats are also available.

== Solution method ==
Meteodyn WT uses [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) which directly takes into consideration the geometry of the terrain in question. The software solves the [[Navier–Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]] numerically by using the K-L [[Turbulence modeling|turbulence model]]. This technique to solve the [[Navier–Stokes equations|Navier-Stokes equations]] takes into account the [[Atmospheric instability|stability]] of the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Language ==
Meteodyn WT is available in [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Standard Chinese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

[[Image:Memoires-cover.jpg|thumb|The [[sandpaper]] cover of ''Mémoires'']]

'''''Mémoires''''' (''Memories'') is an [[artist's book]] made by the Danish artist [[Asger Jorn]] in collaboration with the French artist and theorist [[Guy Debord]]. Printed in 1959, it is the second of two collaborative books by the two men whilst they were both members of the [[Situationist International]].

==Psychogeography and détournement==

[[Image:Memoires.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A page spread in ''Mémoires'']]

The book is a work of [[psychogeography]], detailing a period in Debord's life when he was in the process of leaving the [[Lettrists]], setting up Lettrism International, and showing his 'first masterpiece',&lt;ref&gt;Asger Jorn, The Crucial Years 1954-64, Atkins, Lund Humphries, p 57&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hurlements en Faveur de Sade]]'' (''Howling in Favour of [[Marquis de Sade|Sade]]''), a film devoid of imagery that played white when people were talking on the soundtrack and black during the lengthy silences between.

Credited to Guy-Ernest Debord, with ''structures portantes'' ('load-bearing structures') by Asger Jorn, the book contains 64 pages divided into three sections. The first section is called 'June 1952', and starts with a quote from [[Marx]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Let the dead bury the dead, and mourn them.... our fate will be to become the first living people to enter the new life.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second section, 'December 1952', quotes [[Johan Huizinga|Huizinga]], and the third, 'September 1953', quotes [[Gérard Soubise|Soubise]].

The work contains two separate layers. The first is printed with black ink, reproducing found text and graphics taken from newspapers and magazines. The second layer is printed using coloured inks, splashed across the pages. These sometimes connect images and text, sometimes cover them, and sometimes are seemingly unconnected. The black layer contains fragments of text, maps of Paris and London, illustrations of siege warfare, cheap reproductions of old masters and questions such as 'How do you feel about the world at the moment, Sir?' The coloured layer contains freefloating ink splashes, lines created by a matchstick loaded in ink, and a [[Rorschach inkblot test|Rorschach]] inkblob.

Other pages deal with more personal themes, including a cartoon of the first showing of his film ''Hurlements en Faveur de Sade'', with comments for and against, and references to [[Dérive]], which would become known as Situationist Drift, the habit of walking aimlessly through a city in an attempt to find its spirit. ''[[Détournement]]'' ('diversion' or 'disruption') is also employed in the book to disorient the reader by creating startling collaged juxtapositions. Originally deriving from [[Dada]],&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord, Merrifield, Reaktion, 2005, p 25&lt;/ref&gt; ''détournement'' would become a key situationist strategy.

The last page is an orange swirl, above which reads the single sentence 'I wanted to speak the beautiful language of my century.'&lt;ref&gt;'Je voulais parler la belle langue de mon siècle', Mémoires, p62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auto-destruction: the sandpaper cover==

The book is most famous for its cover, a dust jacket made of heavy-grade [[sandpaper]]. Usually credited to Debord, the sleeve was actually conceived in a conversation between Jorn and the printer, V.O. Permild:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[Permild:] Long had [Jorn] asked me, if I couldn’t find an unconventional material for the book cover. Preferably some sticky asphalt or perhaps glass wool. Kiddingly, he wanted, that by looking at people, you should be able to tell whether or not they had had the book in their hands. He acquiesced by my final suggestion: sandpaper (flint) nr. 2: ‘Fine. Can you imagine the result when the book lies on a blank polished mahogany table, or when it's inserted or taken out of the bookshelf. It planes shavings off the neighbour's desert goat.&lt;ref&gt;Memories on Asger Jorn, Troels Andersen, quoted in ''Books Of Warfare, The Collaboration between Guy Debord &amp; Asger Jorn from 1957-1959'', Christian Nolle [http://virose.pt/vector/b_13/nolle.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== ''Fin de Copenhague'' ==

[[Image:Fin-de-copenhague.jpg|left|thumb|300px|'A splendid landscape that [[Bernard Buffet]] often painted': a page spread in ''Fin de Copenhague'']]

''Fin de Copenhague'' (''Goodbye to Copenhagen'') is the first collaboration between the two artists. The artists' book is credited to Asger Jorn, with Debord listed as "Technical Adviser in Détournement". Also printed by Permild and Rosengreen, [[Copenhagen]], the book was published by Jorn's [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus|Edition Bauhaus Imaginiste]] in May 1957, a few months before this group amalgamated with the Lettrist International to create the Situationists.

In many ways very similar to the later book, the colour layers are more exuberant, the text more pointed. One page, for instance, asks in English:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What do you want? Better and cheaper food? Lots of new clothes? A dream home with all the latest comforts and labour saving devices? A new car . . . a motor launch . . . a light aircraft of your own? Whatever you want, it's coming your way - plus greater leisure for enjoying it all. With electronics, automation and nuclear energy, we are entering on the new Industrial Revolution which will supply our every need, easily . . . quickly . . . cheaply . . . abundantly.&lt;ref&gt;Fin de Copenhague, Asger Jorn, Editions Allia, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other pages include text in French, German, and Danish; illustrations of whisky bottles beer bottles and cigarettes; aeroplanes and oceangoing liners; cartoons of well dressed men and pretty girls and various maps of Copenhagen.  One page declares, 'There's No Whiteness....Viva Free [[Algerian War|Algeria]]!' Each page is then covered with a second layer of coloured ink drops and drips, most of which go right to left, emphasising the direction of the book from beginning to end.

The book ends with the text:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Tell us in not more than 250 words why your girl is the sweetest girl in town.&lt;ref&gt;'The replies, together with the girl's photograph and her address written on the back, were to be sent to the Psychogeographical Committee Of London (especially Debord and Jorn.) ....Nothing is known about the replies Jorn received...' Taken from Art in Progress-Asger Jorn, Atkins, Methuen 1964, inside cover&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Methods of production===

Having just arrived in Copenhagen, Jorn and Debord rushed into a newsagents, stole a huge amount of magazines and newspapers, and spent a drunken afternoon collaging elements together. The next day they arrived at the printers with 32 collages, which were transferred to lithographic plates. Jorn then sat at the top of a ladder over the zinc plates, dropping cup after cup of Indian ink onto them. The plates were then etched and printed over the black texts and images.

The cover was a heavily embossed image of an advertisement for a razor blade.

===The spectacle===

The situationist concept of the [[Spectacle (Situationism)|spectacle]] runs through both books; represented by the newspapers and magazine collage elements, the collage and ink (détournement) used to disrupt the text represents a strategy to see the city as it really is, rather than as charted in maps and signposts.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'The spectacle epitomises the prevailing model of social life. It is the omnipresent celebration of a choice already made in the sphere of production, and the consummate result of that choice. In form as in content the spectacle serves as total justification for the conditions and aims of the existing system.' Guy Debord&lt;ref&gt;Society of the Spectacle, Thesis 6&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Editions==

Originally printed in an edition of 200 by Edition Bauhus Imaginiste in Copenhagen, Fin de Copenhague was reprinted by Éditions Allia in 2001 [https://www.editions-allia.com/fr/livre/312/fin-de-copenhague]. Mémoires was also printed in Copenhagen, in 1959, by Éditions Situationist International. It has been reprinted by Jean-Jacques Pauvert aux Belles Lettres in 1993 and by Éditions Allia in 2004 [https://www.editions-allia.com/fr/livre/303/memoires]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5550">'''Red Wedge''' was a collective of musicians formed in the [[UK]] in 1985, who attempted to engage young people with [[politics]] in general, and the policies of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in particular, during the period leading up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 general election]], in the hope of ousting the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rachel|first=Daniel|title=Walls Come Tumbling Down: The Music and Politics of Rock Against Racism, 2 Tone and Red Wedge|year=2016|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9781447272687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fronted by [[Billy Bragg]] (whose 1985 ''Jobs for Youth'' tour had been a prototype of sorts for Red Wedge), [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]] and [[Communards (band)|The Communards]] lead singer [[Jimmy Somerville]], they put on concert parties and appeared in the media, adding their support to the Labour Party campaign.

The group was launched on 21 November 1985, with Bragg, Weller, [[Strawberry Switchblade]] and [[Kirsty MacColl]] invited to a reception at the [[Palace of Westminster]] hosted by Labour [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|MP]] [[Robin Cook]]. The collective took its name from a 1919 poster by [[Russia]]n constructivist artist [[El Lissitzky]], ''[[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge]]''. Despite this echo of the [[Russian Civil War]], Red Wedge was not a Communist organisation; neither was it officially part of the Labour Party, but it did initially have office space at Labour's headquarters. The group's logo, also inspired by the Lissitzky poster, was designed by [[Neville Brody]].

Red Wedge organised a number of major tours. The first, in January and February 1986, featured Bragg, Weller's band [[The Style Council]], [[The Communards]], [[Junior Giscombe]], [[Lorna Gee]] and [[Jerry Dammers]], and picked up guest appearances from [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[The The]], [[Heaven 17]], [[Bananarama]], [[Prefab Sprout]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Gary Kemp]], [[Tom Robinson]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[The Beat (British band)|The Beat]], [[Lloyd Cole]], [[The Blow Monkeys]], [[Joolz]] and [[The Smiths]].

Red Wedge did not have universal support among other left-wing musicians, and some groups such as [[The Housemartins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepointhowever.org/index.php/culture/99-get-up-off-our-knees|title=Get Up Off Our Knees - An interview with Paul Heaton|website=The Point|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Easterhouse (band)|Easterhouse]] and [[The Redskins]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://banmarchive.org.uk/collections/mt/pdf/86_06_28.pdf|format=PDF|title=Alliances between pop and politics are not new. The formation of Red Wedge, however, is distinctive in its close identification with the Labour Party|first1=Simon|last1= Frith |author2=John Street|date=June 1986 |work=[[Marxism Today]]|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; rejected involvement and/or criticised the campaign from the [[left-wing politics|Left]].

When the general election was called in 1987, Red Wedge also organised a comedy tour featuring [[Lenny Henry]], [[Ben Elton]], [[Robbie Coltrane]], [[Craig Charles]], [[Phill Jupitus]], Mark Miwurdz (Hurst) and [[Harry Enfield]], and another tour by the main musical participants along with [[The The]], [[Captain Sensible]] and the [[Blow Monkeys]]. The group also published an election pamphlet, ''Move On Up'', with a foreword by Labour leader [[Neil Kinnock]].

After the 1987 election produced a third consecutive Conservative victory, many of the musical collective drifted away. A few further gigs were arranged and the group's magazine ''Well Red'' continued, but funding eventually ran out and Red Wedge was formally disbanded in 1990.

The '''Rock Carvings in Tanum''' ({{lang-sv|Hällristningsområdet i Tanum}}) are a collection of [[Petroglyph|petroglyphs]] near [[Tanumshede]], [[Bohuslän]], Sweden, which were declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] in 1994 because of their high concentration. 

== Petroglyphs ==
In total there are thousands of images called the '''Tanum petroglyphs''', on about 600 panels within the World Heritage Area. These are concentrated in distinct areas along a 25 km stretch, and covers an area of about 51 hectares (126 acres or 0.5 km²).

While the region was on the coastline when the drawings were made, it is now at an elevation of 25m.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IZ_KBwAAQBAJ&amp;dq=0190231971|title=Ancient Scandinavia: An Archaeological History from the First Humans to the Vikings|last=Douglas Price|first=Theron|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|isbn=0190231971|location=|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nordic Bronze Age|Scandinavian Bronze Age]] and [[Iron Age]] people were sophisticated craftsmen and very competent travelers by water. (Dates for ages vary with the region; in Scandinavia, the Bronze Age is roughly 1800 to 500 BCE) Many of the glyphs depict boats of which some seem to be of the [[Hjortspring boat]] type carrying around a dozen passengers. Wagons or carts are also depicted.

Other glyphs depict humans with a bow, spear or axe, and others depict hunting scenes. In all cases the pictures show people performing rituals. There is a human at a plough drawn by two oxen, holding what might be a branch or an ox-goading crop made of a number of strips of hide.

One of the larger rocks of [[Nordic Bronze Age]] petroglyphs in Scandinavia (at 22 metres tall and 6 metres wide), the ''Vitlyckehäll'', is located in Tanumshede. It contains nearly 300 carvings of a variety of scenes, people, and objects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The rock carvings are endangered by erosion due to [[acid rain]] and some are thus covered either permanently or during certain times of the year.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gustafsson|first=Anders|last2=Karlsson|first2=Håkan|date=Autumn 2008|title=Places of Power: Control, Public Access and Authenticity at Rock Carvings in Tanum, Sweden and Val Camonica, Italy|url=|journal=Public Archaeology|volume=7|issue=3|pages=174-198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have been painted red to make them more visible for tourists; a practice which has drawn criticism for removing the authenticity and original state of the drawings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_MKi5nMmCy0C&amp;dq=tanum+petroglyphs+painted|title=Europe Before Rome|last=Douglas Price|first=Theron|publisher=OUP USA|year=2013|isbn=0199914702|location=|pages=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent history ==
The first records of the images inscribed at the site were made in 1627 when Peder Alfsön, a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] doctor and [[lector]], made ink drawings of some of the carvings. The first professional recordings were made in 1792 by Carl Gustaf Gottfried Hilfeling, who was sent by nobleman Pehr Tham to draw the carvings. A number of excavations and recordings took place over the course of the early 19th century, primarily led by Carl Georg Brunius and Axel Emmanuel Holmberg, who published research and debated at length the most likely era of their creation. Strong arguments for the now accepted era were not made until the late 19th century, when [[Oscar Montelius]] and [[Viktor Rydberg]] presented evidence linking the drawings to the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1782978828|title=Picturing the Bronze Age|last=|first=|publisher=Oxbow Books|year=2015|isbn=1782978828|location=|pages=5-20|authors=Johan Ling, Peter Skoglund, Ulf Bertilsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 20th century, studies began to focus more on the meaning behind the drawings, rather than determining their age, but late 20th century work confirmed that the drawings were likely made during the Bronze Age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertil Almgren]] (1987) ''Die Datierung Bronzezeitlicher Felszeichnungen in Westschweden'', Acta Musei Antiquitatum Septentrionalum Regiae Universitatis Upsaliensis VI. Uppsala: Uppsala Universitets Museum för Nordiska Fornsaker Gustavianum&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was named a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] in 1994; encompassing approximately 45 km² in total.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is visited by approximately 100,000 people per year, though visitors are not permitted to walk on or touch the drawings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Anthropology==
[[Julian A. Pitt-Rivers|Julian Pitt-Rivers]] reports&lt;ref name="Pitt-Rivers"&gt;''[https://archive.org/stream/peopleofthesierr001911mbp/peopleofthesierr001911mbp_djvu.txt The People of the Sierra]'', [[J. A. Pitt-Rivers]], page 205, 1954, [[Criterion Books]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; in his study of [[Alcalá de la Sierra]] the belief that village children can be stolen by an outsider, disguised as a beggar or a trader, who is hired by a [[anti-rich sentiment|rich man]] whose ill child can only be cured with the blood of healthy babies.
The practice of [[blood donation]] lent credence to the myth.

[[Gerald Brenan]]&lt;ref name="Brenan"/&gt; describes the ''mantequero'' as a monster in human form who lives in deserted areas and feeds on ''manteca''&lt;ref name="DRAEmanteca"&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/drae/srv/search?val=manteca&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0 manteca] in the DRAE&lt;/ref&gt; ("[human] [[adipose tissue|fat]]").
Upon capture, he shouts in a high pitch and, unless just fed, looks thin.
Brenan found the myth alive during his stays in the [[Alpujarra]] (Andalusia):
In 1927 or 1928, he had sublet his [[Yegen]] home to the British writer [[Dick Strachey]], nephew of [[Lytton Strachey]].
One day, Strachey was walking on rough terrain where he saw three suspicious men.
Fearing of [[wikt:bandolero|bandolero]]s, he ran away, but the three [[Romani people in Spain|Gipsies]] chased him and drew their knives shouting at him as a ''mantequero''.
The first impulse of the Gipsies was to kill the ''mantequero'' and [[blood magic|use his blood]] for magical remedies.
However the eldest Gipsy, a convict, judged safer to bring Strachey to the mayor.
They offered to slit his throat themselves, but the British man claimed in his rudimentary Spanish to be a relative of king [[George V of England]], convincing the mayor that he was not dealing with a monster.

A friend of Brenan found that in [[Torremolinos]] all the girls believed in ''mantequeros''.
In the urban version of the legend,&lt;ref name="Brenan"/&gt; an old evil marquis needs baby [[blood transfusion]]s to rejuvenate.

The '''Sacrum bone of Tequixquiac''' is an ancient [[paleo-Indian]] sculpture carved in a [[pleistocene]]-era bone of a prehistoric [[Camel#Evolution|camel]]. It was found by Mexican naturalist Mariano Bárcena in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mesoweb.com/features/jpl/113.html Mesoweb]&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered among the earliest pieces of art from the American continent.&lt;ref&gt;de Anda, Luis Aveleyra Arroyo. "The Pleistocene Carved Bone from Tequixquiac, Mexico: A Reappraisal." American Antiquity (1965): 261-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Palacio Municipal de Tequixquiac (4).JPG|thumbnail|left|Mural inside the Municipality House.]]

A sacrum bone found in [[Tequixquiac]] is considered a work of prehistoric art.  These people were nomadic, hunting large animals such as mammoths and gathering [[fruit]]s as evidenced by archaeological evidence found at the site. One of the most salient discoveries of primitive art in America was found here, called the '''Sacrum bone of Tequixquiac''', which had no purpose but which reflected the ideological sense of the artist who carved the piece of bone from a [[camelid]].

This artifact is located in the [[National Museum of Anthropology]] in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="EncMuc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15096a.htm |language=Spanish |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de Mexico Estado de Mexico Tequixquiac |accessdate=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527201737/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/mexico/mpios/15096a.htm |archivedate=May 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Seven Sorrows [[Polyptych]]''''' is an [[oil painting|oil on panel]] painting by [[Albrecht Dürer]]. The painting includes a central picture (108 x 43&amp;nbsp;cm), currently at the [[Alte Pinakothek]] in [[Munich]], and seven surrounding panels (measuring some 60 x 46&amp;nbsp;cm) which are exhibited at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] of [[Dresden]].

==Description==
The work was commissioned by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], not a long time after his meeting with Dürer at [[Nuremberg]] in April 1496. Stylistic considerations suggest that the artist started to work on the painting only from around 1500.

Modern scholars tend to attribute to  Dürer only the central panel, the others having been executed by his pupils based on his drawings. The central panel, portraying the ''Sorrowing Mother'', arrived in the Bavarian museum from the  '' Benediktbeuren'' convent of [[Munich]] in the early 19th century. It was restored in the 1930s: once the overpaintings and additions were removed, the shell-shaped niche (a motif typical of Italian art), the halo and the sword (a symbol of Mary of the Seven Sorrows) on the right were rediscovered, clarifying the subject of the work.

The other panels were at [[Wittenberg]], seat of Frederick's castle. In 1640 they were moved to the  Kunstkammer of the Prince of Saxony. In the mid-20th century they were restored: their conditions improved, but the attribution was not cleared.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4876">The '''Symphony''' is an [[orchestra]]l composition in four movements by the American composer [[Christopher Theofanidis]].  It was commissioned by the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]], which premiered the work under the conductor [[Robert Spano]] in April 2009.  The piece is dedicated to Robert Spano "in admiration and friendship."&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;[[Christopher Theofanidis|Theofanidis, Christopher]] (2009). [http://www.theofanidismusic.com/programnotes_Symphony_09.html Symphony: Program Note by the Composer]. Retrieved February 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The Symphony has a duration of roughly 35 minutes and is composed in four numbered [[Movement (music)|movements]].  The first movement has a duration of roughly 12 minutes; in the program notes, Theofanidis described it and the fourth movement as "the big pillars of the piece, both emotionally and in scale."  The second movement has a duration of roughly 8 minutes and was described by the composer as "quite lyrical, but not slow."  The third movement is a brief [[scherzo]]-[[ritornello]] with a duration of only about 4 minutes.  The final movement has a duration of roughly 10 minutes; the composer described its relation to the opening movement, writing:{{quote|The first movement and last movement both hinge on two contrasting types of energies—in the first movement, the feeling is joyous but occasionally takes turns into a slightly out-of-control version of itself.  The last movement is quite dark and monolithic in character, but is occasionally tormented by flashes of light and beauty.  I saw these two movements as mirror opposites of each other.  The first is mostly quite fast, the last has a certain breadth and grandeur with some occasional faster music.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;}}

==Reception==
Reviewing a 2011 recording of the Symphony, Jeff Dunn of the ''San Francisco Classical Voice'' wrote, "Listeners will find [Theofanidis's] Texas toast of a Symphony No. 1 an instantly engaging experience."  He added, "Throughout, the music will keep you upright in your seat and as happy as if you'd just watched another ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|Bourne Identity]]'' action flick. Whether you'll want to immerse yourself in further hearings, however, is a matter of taste."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dunn |first=Jeff |title=A New "American" Symphony - Christopher Theofanidis: Symphony No. 1 |work=San Francisco Classical Voice |date=July 5, 2011 |url=https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/a-new-american-symphony |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pierre Ruhe of ''ArtsATL'' opined, "There's much to admire, from its earnestness and craftsmanship to its engagement with a large canvas. Theofanidis' symphony takes a [[Gustav Mahler|Mahlerian]] view that the orchestra can express everything, which is filtered through symphonic Hollywood, from [[John Williams]] to [[Tan Dun]], with a heavy use (or overuse) of percussion for grandiose effect."&lt;ref name="ArtsATL"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ruhe |first=Pierre |title=ASO CD review: Lieberson's "Neruda Songs" and a Theofanidis symphony |work=ArtsATL |date=July 8, 2011 |url=http://www.artsatl.com/2011/07/cd-review-liebersons-neruda-songs-and-a-theofanidis-symphony-on-aso-media/ |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Joshua Kosman of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' also praised the work, writing:{{quote|Theofanidis' great knack is to write music out of fairly familiar harmonic and rhythmic building blocks, yet have it come out sounding fresh and provocative. Aside from the lack of a slow movement, the four-movement structure of his First Symphony is traditional - it's bolstered by two large and energetic outer movements, with scherzo-like interludes in between. The opening, which seems to be channeling memories of Scottish bagpipes, is the symphony's most fascinating movement, built around two crisply delineated themes that fall gratefully on the ear. Theofanidis spices up his tonal harmonies with enough surprises to keep things moving, and the orchestral writing is first rate; only the square-cut phrasing, with most gestures returning in predictable groups of four, wears thin.&lt;ref name="SFC"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kosman |first=Joshua |title=CD review: Christopher Theofanidis, 'Symphony No. 1' |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=July 3, 2011 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/article/CD-review-Christopher-Theofanidis-Symphony-No-2365875.php |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Recording==
A recording of the symphony, performed by Robert Spano and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, was released through the orchestra's label ASO Media on June 28, 2011.&lt;ref name="ArtsATL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SFC" /&gt;

'''Terry Smith''' (born '''Terence Edwin Smith''' in [[Geelong]], Victoria, 1944) is an Australian [[art historian]], [[art critic]] and artist who currently lives and works in [[Pittsburgh]], New York and Sydney.

Since 2001 he has been Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Contemporary Art History and Theory in the Department of the History of Art and Architecture at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He also serves as a Board member of [[The Andy Warhol Museum]], [[Pittsburgh]].

==Career==
Smith was a student at [[Melbourne High School]], where he won a General Exhibition in the 1962 Matriculation examinations. Between 1963 and 1967, he studied at the [[University of Melbourne]], where he studied art history under Professor Sir Joseph Burke, Franz Philipp and [[Bernard William Smith|Bernard Smith]]. When the [[Power Institute of Fine Arts|Power Institute]] was established at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1968, he tutored to professors Bernard Smith, David Saunders and Donald Brook.

Winning a Harkness Fellowship in 1972, he studied at the [[Institute of Fine Arts]], New York, under professors Goldwater, Rubin and Rosenblum, and at [[Columbia University]] under Professor [[Meyer Schapiro]]. While in New York, he joined the [[Art &amp; Language]] group of conceptual artists, including [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Ian Burn]], [[Mel Ramsden]] and [[Michael Corris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Gwen Allen|title=Artists' Magazines: An Alternative Space for Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZhNRP-wfkAC&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=Terry%20Smith%20Art%20and%20Language&amp;pg=PA237#v=onepage&amp;q=Terry%20Smith%20Art%20and%20Language&amp;f=false|year=2011|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262681102|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained an active member 1972–1976.

Returning to Australia in 1975, he taught contemporary art and art [[historical method]] in the Fine Arts Department at the University of Melbourne and at the Art School, Preston Institute of Technology. His Master of Arts thesis on "American Abstract Expressionism: ethical attitudes and moral function" received the University Medal in 1976 from the [[University of Sydney]].

Appointed a lecturer at the Power Institute of Fine Arts in 1976, Smith remained until 2001, becoming Power Professor of Contemporary Art and Director of the Power Institute, Foundation for Art and Visual Culture from 1994. During his tenure, the Institute became an international centre for the study of contemporary visual cultures. He was a founding board member of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, and remained on that Board until 2001.

When Ian Burn and Nigel Lendon returned to Australia in 1976, Smith joined with them to found Media Action Group, which soon was augmented by others, including Ian Milliss, and became Union Media Services (Sydney), an independent, artist-run organisation that provided graphic art services to the union movement and dissident groups. Smith wrote art criticism for the ''[[Weekend Australian]]'', ''[[Nation Review]]'', ''[[The Times on Sunday]]'', as well a number of articles for local and international journals, now numbering over 100.

Smith's 1986 doctoral dissertation became ''Making the Modern: Industry, Art and Design in America'' (University of Chicago Press, 1993), winner of the inaugural [http://www.artknowledgenews.com/2009-09-11-22-28-23-terry-smith-named-2009-winner-of-georgia-okeeffe-museum-book-prize.html Georgia O'Keeffe Museum Prize] in 2009 for the best book on modern American art published in the past 25 years. The committee of jurors for the book prize they chose Smith's book because of its "excellence of writing and scholarship, its originality and its outstanding and multi-faceted exploration of the emergence and flourishing of modernism as a phenomenon in American art and culture."

Smith contributed three chapters to Bernard Smith's classic text ''Australian Painting 1788–1990'' (Melbourne: Oxford University Press, 1991) and wrote lengthy studies of key works and themes in Australian art. These are collected in the two volumes ''Transformations in Australian Art, volume 1, The Nineteenth Century: Landscape, Colony'' and ''Nation, volume 2, The Twentieth Century: Modernism and Aboriginality'' (Craftsman House, Sydney, 2002; joint winner of the Power Institute/Art Association of Australia and New Zealand Book Prize, 2003).

He also edited many other books, including ''In Visible Touch: Modernism and Masculinity'' (Power Publications and the University of Chicago Press, 1997), ''First People, Second Chance: The Humanities and Aboriginal Australia'' (Australian Academy of the Humanities, 1999), ''Impossible Presence: Surface and Screen in the Photogenic Era'' (Power Publications and the University of Chicago Press, 2001), with Paul Patton, Jacques Derrida, ''Deconstruction Engaged: The Sydney Seminars'' (Power Publications, 2001; Japanese edition, Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 2005), and ''Contemporary Art + Philanthropy'' (University of NSW Press, 2007).

In 1996, Smith was elected a Fellow of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]] and a Membre titulaire, [[Comité International d'Histoire de l'Art]], serving as the Australian representative and Vice-President of the latter 1999–2003. He has been a visiting professor at the [[University of California, San Diego|Universities of California, San Diego]], [[University of Chicago|Chicago]], [[Duke University]], [[University of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[University of Queensland|Queensland]], and is currently a Visiting Professor in the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Planning at the University of Sydney. Smith has also been awarded a number of prestigious research fellowships including, in recent years, being named a Getty Scholar at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles 2001-2; Fondation de France Chercheur Invité at the Institut national d'histoire de l'art, Paris, 2007; and GlaxoSmithKlein Senior Fellow at the National Humanities Center, Research Triangle Park, Raleigh-Durham, NC.

Smith's current work explores the relationships between contemporary art and its wider settings, within a world picture that he believes is characterised above all by its contemporaneity. His findings are being presented in a series of books. These include ''The Architecture of Aftermath'' (University of Chicago Press, 2006); ''Antinomies of Art and Culture: Modernity, postmodernity and contemporaneity'' (edited with Nancy Condee and Okwui Enwezor, and published by Duke University Press, 2008); and ''What is Contemporary Art?'' (University of Chicago Press, 2009). He is working on ''Contemporary Art of the World: Late Modern to Now'' (Laurence King and Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2011).

==Awards==
Smith was named by the [[College Art Association]] as the 2010 winner of the [[Frank Jewett Mather]] Award for distinction in art criticism. The announcement reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Terry Smith is that rare art and social historian able to write criticism at once alert to the forces that contextualise art and sensitive to the elements and qualities that inhere to the works of art themselves. His most recent book, ''What Is Contemporary Art?'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009), contains a series of interrelated essays that unpack a vast range of topics and issues and take the reader on a theoretical tour through some of the world's most influential art museums, laying bare their conflicted missions and studying the heightening distinction, and dispute, between modern and contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.collegeart.org/awards/2010awards |title=Franklin Jewett Mather Award |publisher=CAA |accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Death of Nelson''''' is a wall painting in the [[Palace of Westminster#Royal Gallery|Royal Gallery]] of the [[Palace of Westminster]] by the Irish artist [[Daniel Maclise]].  A finished study for it, in the form of a painting, is in the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]].

==History==

Maclise received the commission for two wall paintings in the Royal Gallery in 1857; these were to depict ''[[The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher after the Battle of Waterloo]]'' and ''The Death of Nelson''.  However Maclise found that creating the works in [[fresco]] would prove too difficult, and he resigned the commission.  He then discovered the waterglass technique (infusing the surface with [[sodium silicate]]) and resumed the commission.  Maclise started work on ''The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher'' in January 1860 and completed it during the winter of 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.explore-parliament.net/nssMovies/06/0647/0647_.htm| title = 'The Meeting of Wellington and Blücher' by Daniel Maclise| accessdate = 23 April 2010 | publisher =  Armchair Travel Co }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then submitted a sketch for ''The Death of Nelson'' to the Fine Arts Commission.  However [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], the prime promoter of the Commission, died in 1861 and the Commission lost some of its momentum.  It was not until 1863 that Maclise received permission to continue with the scheme.&lt;ref name=royal&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.explore-parliament.net/nssMovies/01/0100/0100_.htm| title = 'The Death of Nelson' by Daniel Maclise| accessdate = 23 April 2010 | publisher =  Armchair Travel Co }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 1859 and 1864 Maclise created a plan for this picture; this was a painting that comprised a "finished study" for the work.  This painting was purchased by the Walker Art Gallery in 1892 from the Art Union of London; the money for this was obtained from the Liverpool Naval Exhibition.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.asp?venue=2&amp;id=37| title = ''The Death of Nelson' 1859-64', by Daniel Maclise (1806-70) | accessdate = 23 April 2010 | publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wall paintings did not survive well; by 1869 the colours were fading.  However modern critics continue to praise "their serious and sombre realism and their expressive power".&lt;ref name=royal/&gt;

==The two paintings==

The study, copied for the wall painting, was created in 1859–64 and is organised as a [[frieze]], in a long narrow format.  It shows the dying [[Horatio Nelson|Admiral Nelson]] on the deck of ''[[HMS Victory]]'', cradled in the arms of [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Captain Hardy]], with other figures, including [[William Beatty (surgeon)|Dr&amp;nbsp;Beatty]], leaning over him. They are surrounded by members of the crew.  Maclise took trouble over the accuracy of details in the picture; he interviewed survivors of the battle and researched the naval equipment in use at the time.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt;  However the painting is not an accurate account of the event, because Nelson was quickly taken below decks, where he died; it is rather an idealisation of the event.&lt;ref name=royal/&gt;  Included in the painting are two [[black people]]; this is likely to be historically accurate as two men from Africa were included in the crew of ''HMS Victory''.  At this time people of African descent were integrated with other members of the crew, although they tended to work in the lower ranks. One of the Africans is pointing towards the [[Assassination|assassin]] of Nelson.&lt;ref name=walker/&gt;

==The Engraving==

The Maclise painting was engraved by Charles W. Sharpe in 1876 and published the Art Union of London. It sold widely around the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marinecurator.blogspot.ca/2013/10/trafalgar-day.html Dan Conlin, "Trafalgar Day: The Death of Nelson", ''The Marine Curaotr's Blog'' Maritime Museum of the Atlantic]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nelson engraving was often sold with an engraving of the companion work by Maclise, "Wellington Meeting Blucher at the Battle of Waterloo".

==Other depictions of the event==
In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century the death of Nelson was a popular subject for artists.  Other notable paintings of the event include ''[[The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805]]'' painted by [[Arthur William Devis]] in 1805 now found at [[National Maritime Museum]], and ''[[The Death of Nelson (West painting)|The Death of Nelson]]'' painted by [[Benjamin West]] in 1806 and now at the Walker Art Gallery.

'''''The Human Condition''''' ('''''La condition humaine''''') generally refers to two similar [[oil painting|oil on canvas]] paintings by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]]. One was completed in 1933 and is in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington DC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=70170 La condition humaine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013221719/http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/tinfo_f?object=70170 |date=2008-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was completed in 1935 and is part of the [[Simon Spierer Collection]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="Taschen"&gt;Paquet, Marcel, ''Magritte.'' Taschen (2006), Koln, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of drawings of the same name exist as well, including one at the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1992.274 Cleveland Museum of Art - The Human Condition]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relation to other paintings ==

One of Magritte's most common artistic devices was the use of objects to hide what lies behind them. For example, in ''[[The Son of Man]]'' (1964) an apple hides the face of a man wearing a bowler hat, and in ''[[The Pleasure Principle (painting)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' (1937) a bright flash likewise obscures a face. In ''The Human Condition'', the cover-up appears in the form a painting within a painting.

Magritte had this to say of his 1933 work:
:In front of a window seen from inside a room, I placed a painting representing exactly that portion of the landscape covered by the painting. Thus, the tree in the picture hid the tree behind it, outside the room. For the spectator, it was both inside the room within the painting and outside in the real landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Torczyner, Harry, ''Magritte: Ideas and Images.'' New York, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magritte continues his explanation in a letter to the Belgian poet Achille Chavée. 
:"Which is how we see the world, namely, outside of us; although having only one representation of it within us. Similarily we sometimes remember a past event as being in the present. Time and space lose meaning and our daily experience becomes paramount. This is how we see the world. We see it outside ourselves, and at the same time we only have a representation of it in ourselves. In the same way, we sometimes situate in the past that which is happening in the present. Time and space thus loose the vulgar meaning that only daily experience takes into account. Questions such as 'What does this picture mean, what does it represent?' are possible only if one is incapable of seeing a picture in all its truth, only if one automaically understands that a very precise image does not show precisely what it is. It's like believing that the implied meaning is worth more than the overt meaning. There is no implied meaning in my paintings, despite the confusion that attributes symbolic meaning to my painting. How can anyone enjoy interpreting symbols? They are 'substitutes' that are only useful to a mind that is incapable of knowing the things themselves. A devotee of interpretation cannot see a bird; he only sees it as a symbol. Although this manner of knowing the 'world' may be useful in treating mental illness, it would be silly to confuse it with a mind that can be applied to any kind of thinking at all." &lt;ref&gt;Excerpt from Magritte's letter to A. Chavee, Sept. 30, 1960. Translation of primary source: http://www.mattesonart.com/the-human-condition-1933--1935-with-articles.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Paintings within paintings appear frequently in Magritte works. ''Euclidean Walks'' (1955) is a work perhaps most like ''The Human Condition.'' It places a canvas in front of a high window depicting the tower of a close building and a street below. In ''The Fair Captive'' (1947), there is a beach scene with an easel set up. As in the previous cases it holds a canvas depicting what the viewer might expect to be behind it. This time though, flames from a burning tuba in front of the frame are seen "reflected." ''The Call of the Peaks'' (1942) shows a mountain canvas in front of a mountain background which is buffeted on the right by a curtain.

The list of similar works can easily be extended to include such paintings as ''The Key to the Fields'' (1936), its 1964 reincarnation ''Evening Falls'' and the 1942 work ''The Domain of Arnheim'', all of which feature broken windows whose shattered glass pieces on the floor still show the outside world they used to conceal.

Another series of pieces which show both strong similarities and strong differences from ''The Human Condition'' are the works titled ''The Alarm Clock''. In these works, a painting is placed on an easel in front of a window or on a balcony with a simple landscape in the background. However, the painting does not show what may possibly be behind, but is instead an upside-down basic fruit still life.

Analysis: At first, one automatically assumes that the painting on the easel depicts the portion of the landscape outside the window that it hides from view. After a moment's consideration, however, one realizes that this assumption is based upon a false premise: that is, that the imagery of Magritte's painting is real, while the painting on the easel is a representation of that reality. In fact, there is no difference between them. Both are part of the same painting, the same artistic fabrication. It is perhaps to this repeating cycle, in which the viewer, even against his will, sees the one as real and the other as representation, that Magritte's title makes reference. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.70170.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10726">The '''YES! Association''' (also known by its Swedish name, '''Föreningen JA!''') is an [[Artist collective|art collective]] based in [[Sweden]]. The collective was founded in 2005 and continues to be active today. The collective creates art through the use of enactments and [[performance art|performances]]. The YES! Association is known primarily for art exhibitions that deal with themes of [[gender]], [[sexuality]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist Art Manifestos: An Anthology|last=Deepwell|first=Katy|publisher=KT Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation ==

The YES! Association was founded in 2005. It originated out of an art exhibition entitled “Art Feminism - strategies and effects in Sweden from the 1970’s until today”. Responding to a perceived lack of equity in Swedish public art institutions, members of the YES! Association proposed a document, dubbed the “Equal Opportunities Agreement”. The YES! Association used their live work “Press Conference /Performance”, a part of the broader exhibition, to provide art institutions with the opportunity to sign the agreement. Institutional signatories would have committed to engage in concrete actions to increase diversity and equity, particularly through the use of q[[Racial quota|uotas.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  If it had been signed by the art organizations the agreement would have been legally binding. However, no institutions present at the time agreed to sign the document.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artforum.com/words/id=36879|title=YES!

== Key figures ==

The YES! Association is composed of original founding members and newer participants. Founding members include
* Malin Arnell, a feminist artist whose work engages with concepts of intimacy and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.konstnarligaforskarskolan.se/wordpress/?page_id=125|title=Malin Arnell «  Konstnärliga forskarskolan|website=www.konstnarligaforskarskolan.se|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Johanna Gustavsson, an artist whose work focuses on pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://practiceinternational.org/research/stockholm-assembly-pamphlet|title=Stockholm Assembly pamphlet {{!}} Practice International|website=practiceinternational.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Line S. Karlström, an artist with a focus on the interplay of power and identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.grossestreffen.org/line-skywalker-karlstroem|title=Line Skywalker Karlström|website=www.grossestreffen.org|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Anna Linder, a feminist artist known for her work in moving images.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfmdc.org/user/12951|title=Anna Linder {{!}} cfmdc.org|website=www.cfmdc.org|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Fia-Stina Sandlund, a Swedish artist known for feminist art films.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;   
Other members of the collective over the years include: 
* [[Åsa Elzén]], an artist whose work focuses on post-colonial and intersectional feminist theory. 
The YES! Association has collaborated with artists and institutions including Melanie Cervantes, Regina José Galindo, Gluklya, Victoria Lomasko, Pauline Boudry/Renate Lorenz, [[Liza Morozova]], Tanja Ostojic, Mujeres Públicas, Bureau of Melodramatic Research, and Anna Zvyagintseva.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artslant.com/global/artists/show/469760-yes-association-f%C3%B6reningen-ja|title=YES! Association / Föreningen JA!|website=ArtSlant|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, The YES! Association has received support from the [[Swedish Arts Council]] through the [[IASPIS]] program, facilitating collaborations with queer artist Lee H. Jones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.konstnarsnamnden.se/default.aspx?id=15114|title=Iaspis - Talk: I am talking about something happening right here, right now with Lee H.

== Themes ==

Artistic works by The YES! Association have predominantly dealt with themes of gender, sexuality, race, and capitalism. Drawing on the feminist activist roots of the artists making up the collective (see above for an overview of Key Figures), exhibitions have investigated the role of women and other equity seeking groups in both the art world and society more broadly. In these works, several sub-themes emerge:

=== Equity and diversity in art ===

The founding work of the YES! Association was an activist call for accountability and increased diversity in Swedish public art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Since the 2005 work “Press Conference /Performance”, the YES! Association has used a variety of platforms such as radio interviews, panels, and articles to argue that contemporary art must do a better job of representing equity seeking communities.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lilithperformancestudio.com/?curatorial=the-yes-association-privilege-walksymposium-feminist-and-intersectional-aspects-of-contemporary-art|title=The YES! Association Privilege Walk/Symposium – Feminist and Intersectional Aspects of Contemporary Art {{!}} Lilith Performance Studio|website=lilithperformancestudio.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, the YES! Association has used the exploration of notions of privilege and oppression to illustrate divides in the art world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Intersectional feminist theory ===

The YES! Association’s artwork has repeatedly come back to investigations of [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] modes of [[feminist art]]. In particular, the collective has focused on the benefits and drawbacks of knowledge that is based on categories.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Politics in a glass case: feminism, exhibition cultures andcuratorial transgressions|last=Dimitrakaki and Perry|first=Angela and Lara|publisher=Liverpool University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=Liverpool|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through their work, the YES! Association has challenged the utility of binaries, making a feminist argument for a more intersectional understanding of identity. Their work rarely looks at ‘women’ as an isolated category, opting instead to include considerations such a class, race, and sexuality, as well.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Hannah Arendt ===

Political theorist [[Hannah Arendt]] has been cited as both a theme and inspiration in the work of the YES! Association. A Jewish-American thinker, Arendt was born in Germany and fled Europe during the Second World War. Her work dealt largely with systems of power, particularly political hierarchies such as totalitarianism. A noted woman theorist in a field dominated by men, Arendt is often held up as an example of feminist excellence (though she herself may not have used the label “feminist”).   The YES! Association has created works that drew on Arendt’s commitment to the spread of ideas and conversation. The collective has also collaborated with associations devoted to the memory of Arendt, such as The Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities at [[Bard College]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hac.bard.edu/event/index.php?eid=131429&amp;did|title=Hannah Arendt Center Conferences &amp; Events|website=hac.bard.edu|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable works ===
The works of the YES! Association have taken a variety of forms but commonly include aspects of performance and dialogue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== “Press conference /performance”, 2005, Performance. ====

For the piece, members of the YES! Association put forward a document entitled the “Equal Opportunities Agreement”. The document aimed to legally bind Swedish public art institutions to uphold quotas to improve diversity. The performance was executed in the Dunker Culture House.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== (Dis)agreements? – the utility, effectiveness, and problematics of categories. 2010. Performance, a video, an agreement, a teach-in, and a letter. ====

The work used a video and teach-in discussion to consider diversity in art institutions. The work took place at the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art of Brooklyn Museum.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== “SMOKING AREA”, 2012, Floor Painting. ====

“SMOKING AREA” paid tribute to political theorist Hannah Arendt. The work used a floor painting made with yellow paint to create a designated space where viewers/ participants could come, smoke, and discuss ideas. The floor painting aimed to further the aims of Arendt, whose work argued for the power of friendship and dialogue. The work was hosted by the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== “I am talking about something happening right here, right now”, 2012, Discussion. ====

This work operated as a discussion with Lee H. Jones. Using an activist framework, the discussion centered around the interplay of institutions and labour. The work was funded by IASPIS.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Notable Exhibitions ===

==== "Art Feminism – Strategies and Consequences in Sweden from the 1970s to the Present", 2005. ====

This was the first exhibition that the YES! Association participated in. The Dunker Culture House served as the host institution. The YES! Association performed their work “Press Conference /Performance”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== “The Privilege Walk/Symposium – Feminist and intersectional aspects of contemporary art”, 2008. ====

The exhibition operated as a symposium held over the course of a weekend at the Lilith Performance Studio in Malmo, Sweden. Components included lectures, film screenings, performances, and workshops. Thematically, the exhibition focused on the Swedish art movement and persisting equity concerns.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== “(art)work(sport)work(sex)work”, 2015. ====

The exhibition was hosted by the Power Plant in Toronto, Canada. The work was commissioned in conjunction with the 2015 Pan Am games. It considered the three fields of art, sport, and sex work. Through the use of bus rides, the exhibition used urban space to comment on social norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eflux. com/announcements/29358/summer-2015-exhibitions/|title=Summer 2015 exhibitions|last=e-flux|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philadelphia Continental SAR.jpg|thumb|287px|Philadelphia Continental Chapter of the [[Sons of the American Revolution|SAR]] at a ceremony commemorating the birth of [[George Washington]]]]

The '''Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary War Soldier''', sometimes referred to as the '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the American Revolution''', is a [[war memorial]] located within [[Washington Square (Philadelphia)|Washington Square]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The memorial honors the thousands of soldiers who died during the [[American Revolutionary War]], many of whom were buried in mass graves in the square. The tomb and Washington Square are part of [[Independence National Historical Park]].

The memorial was first conceived in 1954 by the Washington Square Planning Committee, and was completed in 1957.&lt;ref name=ushistory&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/tour/tomb-of-the-unknown-soldier.htm "Tomb of the Unknown Revolutionary Soldier"] on USHistory.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The monument was designed by architect [[G. Edwin Brumbaugh]] and includes an [[eternal flame]] and a bronze cast of [[Jean Antoine Houdon]]'s statue of [[George Washington (Houdon)|George Washington]] as the monument's  centerpiece. The tomb includes remains which were disinterred, after archeological examination, from beneath the square. The remains are that of a soldier, but it is uncertain if he was [[Colonial history of the United States|Colonial]] or [[British people|British]].&lt;ref name=ushistory /&gt; An unknown number of bodies were buried beneath the square and the surrounding area. Remains are still occasionally found during construction and maintenance projects.

Engraved in the side of the tomb are these words:&lt;ref name=ushistory /&gt;

* "Freedom is a light for which many men have died in darkness"
* "The independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts of common dangers, suffering and success" ([[George Washington's Farewell Address|Washington Farewell Address]], Sept. 17, 1796)
* "In unmarked graves within this square lie thousands of unknown soldiers of Washington's Army who died of wounds and sickness during the Revolutionary War."

The plaque on the tomb reads:&lt;ref name=ushistory /&gt;
* "Beneath this stone rests a soldier of Washington's army who died to give you liberty."

'''''Totes Meer''''' ([[German language|German]] for "Dead Sea") is a 1941 oil-on-canvas painting by [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]]. It depicts a moonlit [[landscape painting|landscape]] populated by a graveyard of crashed aircraft of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Luftwaffe]].  The broken shards of metal from the wings and fuselages resemble a seascape of jagged ice, possibly inspired by Caspar David Friedrich's ''[[The Sea of Ice]]''.  It measures {{convert|40.0|xx|60.0|in|cm}} and has been in the collection of the [[Tate Gallery]] since 1946.

==Background==
Nash was an official [[war artist]] in the First and Second World Wars.  In 1940, he was asked to work for the [[Air Ministry]], and Nash started work on ''Totes Meer'' that year.  Some representatives of the Air Ministry disliked his style of art, and his full-time position was terminated before the end of the year.  ''Totes Meer'' was completed in 1941, and offered to the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] in 1941.  Nash was paid £150 for the painting.

==Description==
The work was based on sketches and photographs made at the Metal and Produce Recovery Unit at [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] near [[Oxford]] in August 1940, where the remains of both German and British crashed aircraft were brought to be recycled at the [[Morris Motors]] car factory nearby, which being used to construct and repair aircraft.  Nash wrote that, under moonlight, the sea of wreckage could be perceived to move and twist, but in reality it was of course dead, and the only movement was the flight of a [[Northern white-faced owl|white owl]], depicted near the horizon at the right.

The desolate landscape harkens back to the paintings that Nash made as a war artist in the First World War, such as ''[[We are Making a New World]]'' or ''[[The Menin Road]]''.  The mournful tone may also have been influenced by his personal circumstances: an affair with painter [[Eileen Agar]] was coming to an end, and Nash was suffering from a respiratory illness which ultimately caused his death.  

Nash initially called the work ''Iron Sea'', but he hoped that the work could be reproduced on postcards to be sent to Germany as propaganda and decided on a German title instead. Nash described his painting:

{{blockquote|The thing (the salvage dump) looked to me, suddenly, like a great inundating sea. You might feel – under certain circumstances – a moonlight night, for instance, this is a vast tide moving across the fields, the breakers rearing up and crashing on the plain. And then, no, nothing moves, it is not water or even ice, it is something static and dead. It is metal piled up, wreckage. It is hundreds and hundreds of flying creatures which invaded these shores (how many Nazi planes have been shot down or otherwise wrecked in this country since they first invaded?). Well, here they are, or some of them. By moonlight, the waning moon, one could swear they began to move and twist and turn as they did in the air. A sort of rigor mortis? No, they are quite dead and still. The only moving creature is the white owl flying low over the bodies of the other predatory creatures, raking the shadows for rats and voles. She isn’t there, of course, as a symbol quite so much as the form and colour essential just there to link up with the cloud fringe overhead.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;}}

==Reception==
[[Kenneth Clark]], chairman of the War Artists' Advisory Committee, described ''Totes Meer'' as "the best war picture so far"&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;"Art in War: Exploring a Painting", BBC&lt;/ref&gt; and the painting was an immediate success when it was displayed in an exhibition of National War Pictures at the [[National Gallery]] in May 1941.  It was presented to the Tate Gallery in 1946 and is considered to be one of the most important British paintings of the Second World War.

'''''Unir Cinéma: Revue du Cinéma Africain''''' was the first periodical entirely devoted to African cinema to come out of Francophone Africa. Its impact established it as an essential reference tool on cinema on the continent.

==Publishing==
First published in 1973, this [[Senegalese]] film magazine was typewritten and duplicated through offset printing. Written by both Senegalese and French reviewers and published by the Catholic Information Center of the diocese of Saint Louis, it provided up to date filmographies of recent motion pictures as well as more detailed entries (including credits, filmmakers' biographies, film summaries and critiques) of the most significant cinematographic works by African filmmakers.

==Content and Themes==
Its detailed reports on [[film festivals]] throughout the world revealed the exposure and appreciation of [[African cinema]] on an international level, while its listings of places where African films have been or will be commercially exhibited attested to the scope of their circulation. Carefully prepared by-country dossiers revealed both the status of cinema in different regions and the efforts undertaken by local governments to promote the production and distribution of their films. While little effort was made to offer more in-depth critical insights into the thematics, aesthetics and ethics of African cinema, Unir Cinéma did furnish its readers with bibliographies of the latest articles on African cinema in international magazines and journals as well as the names of international periodicals with a serious interest in the critique of African films.

==Ending==
First edited by Pere Jean Vast on tight budget in 1973 until 1996, later by Pere Joseph Lambrecht (1998–2000).

==Notes==
* Unir Cinéma was initially (from no. 1 to 35) a general periodical titled Unir (L'Echo de Saint-Louis). In 1973 it switched focus exclusively to film and continued as Unir Cinema: Revue Du Cinéma Africain.

In 1953-1955 this period was associated with travel to the city of Kanev on the Dnieper River. Delighted with the beauty of the Dnieper banks, the artist painted many sketches, expressing alive, the immediate impression of a majestic image what he saw.

'''''Whaam!''''' is a 1963 [[diptych]] painting by the American artist [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. It is one of the best-known works of [[pop art]], and among Lichtenstein's most important paintings. ''Whaam!'' was first exhibited at the [[Leo Castelli Gallery]] in New York City in 1963, and purchased by the [[Tate Gallery]], London, in 1966. It has been on permanent display at [[Tate Modern]] since 2006.

The left-hand panel shows a fighter plane firing a rocket that, in the right-hand panel, hits a second plane which explodes in flames. Lichtenstein conceived the image from several [[comic-book]] panels. He transformed his primary source, a panel from a 1962 [[War comics|war comic book]], by presenting it as a diptych while altering the relationship of the graphical and narrative elements. ''Whaam!'' is regarded for the temporal, spatial and psychological integration of its two panels. The painting's title is integral to the action and impact of the painting, and displayed in large [[onomatopoeia]] in the right panel.

Lichtenstein studied as an artist before and after serving in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. He practiced anti-aircraft drills during basic training, and he was sent for pilot training but the program was canceled before it started. Among the topics he tackled after the war were romance and [[military art|war]].  He depicted aerial combat in several works. ''Whaam!'' is part of a series on war that he worked on between 1962 and 1964, and along with ''[[As I Opened Fire]]'' (1964) is one of his two large war-themed paintings.

==Background==
In 1943 Lichtenstein left his study of painting and drawing at [[The Ohio State University]] to serve in the U.S. Army, where he remained until January 1946. After entering training programs for languages, engineering, and piloting, all of which were canceled, he served as an orderly, draftsman and artist in noncombat roles.&lt;ref name=Chron/&gt;&lt;ref name="HWaW"&gt;{{cite book|author1=McCarthy, David  |author2=Horace Clifford Westermann |lastauthoramp=yes | title = H.C.

A new generation of artists emerged in late 1950s and early 1960s with a more objective, "cool" approach characterized by the [[art movement]]s known today as [[Minimalism (visual arts)|minimalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-minimalism.htm|title=Minimalism|accessdate=2013-08-17|date=&lt;!--unknown but likely after 2009 when this foundation was created and before this accessdate of 2013-08-17--&gt;|author=Wolf, Justin|publisher=The Art Story Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hard-edge painting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-hard-edge-painting.htm|title=Hard-Edge Painting|accessdate=2013-08-17|date=&lt;!--unknown but likely after 2009 when this foundation was created and before this accessdate of 2013-08-17--&gt;|author=Wolf, Justin|publisher=The Art Story Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[color field]] painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lhMS8Ii73ZkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Systemic+Painting,#v=onepage&amp;q=Systemic%20Painting%2C&amp;f=false|author=Alloway, Lawrence|editor=Battcock, Gregory|title=Minimal Art: A Critical Anthology|chapter=Systemic Painting|isbn=978-0-520-20147-7|year=1995|publisher=University of California Press|pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[neo-Dada]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chilvers, Ian  |author2=John Glaves-Smith |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-923965-8|year=2009|page=503}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluxus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10457|title=Art Terms: Fluxus|publisher=[Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pop art]], all of which re-defined the [[avant-garde]] contemporary art of the time.

[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
Lichtenstein's early comics-based works such as ''[[Look Mickey]]'' focused on popular animated characters. By 1963 he had progressed to more serious, dramatic subject matter, typically focusing on romantic situations or war scenes.&lt;ref name="RLMoMA"&gt;{{cite book| author = Lanchner, Carolyn| title = Roy Lichtenstein| url =  https://books.google.com/?id=LG8xJ-LRHJkC&amp;pg=PA11| year = 2009| publisher = Museum of Modern Art| isbn = 978-0-87070-770-4| pages = 11–14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic books as a genre were held in low esteem at the time. Public antipathy led in 1954 to examination of alleged connections between comic books and [[juvenile delinquency|youth crime]] during [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency|Senate investigations into juvenile delinquency]];&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themodern.org/collection/mr-bellamy/917|title=Mr. Bellamy|accessdate=2013-07-15|publisher=Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth|author=Thistlethwaite, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of that decade, comic books were regarded as material of "the lowest commercial and intellectual kind", according to Mark Thistlethwaite of the [[Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth]].&lt;ref name="MB"/&gt; Lichtenstein was not a comic-book enthusiast as a youth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/18/roy-lichtenstein-pop-art-tate|title=Roy Lichtenstein outgrew term pop art, says widow prior to Tate show|accessdate=2013-06-15|date=18 February 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Brown, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was enticed as an artist by the challenge of creating art based on a subject remote from the typical "artistic image".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/whaam-artist-roy-lichtenstein-was-not-a-fan-of-comics-and-cartoons-8500222.html|title=Whaam! artist Roy Lichtenstein was 'not a fan of comics and cartoons'|accessdate=2013-06-15|date=18 February 2013|work=[[The Independent]]|author=Clark, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein admitted he was "very excited about, and very interested in, the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love, hate, war, etc., in these cartoon images."&lt;ref name="RLMoMA" /&gt;

Lichtenstein's romance and war comic-based works took heroic subjects from small source panels and monumentalized them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Schneckenburger, Honnef  |author2=Fricke Ruhrberg |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Art of the 20th Century| url = https://books.google.com/?id=069rL6vA1BAC&amp;pg=PA321| year = 2000| publisher = Taschen | isbn = 978-3-8228-5907-0| page = 321| editor = Ingo, Walter F. }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Whaam!'' is comparable in size to the generally large canvases painted at that time by the abstract expressionists.&lt;ref name="smart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-reviews/9888768/Lichtenstein-at-Tate-Modern-review.html|title=Lichtenstein, at Tate Modern, review|accessdate=2013-06-15|date=23 February 2013|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Smart, Alastair}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of Lichtenstein's many works with an aeronautical theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pisano| first = Dominick| title = The Airplane in American Culture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ISeibypYDEcC&amp;pg=PA275| year = 2003| publisher = University of Michigan Press| isbn = 978-0-472-06833-3| page = 275| editor = Pisano, Dominick A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that "the heroes depicted in comic books are fascist types, but I don't take them seriously in these paintings—maybe there is a point in not taking them seriously, a political point. I use them for purely formal reasons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Naremore| first = James| title = Modernity and Mass Culture| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CeEfBGnsbkwC&amp;pg=PA208| year = 1991| publisher = Indiana University Press| isbn = 978-0-253-20627-5| page = 208| editor = Naremore, James and Patrick M.

[[Paul Gravett]] suggests that Lichtenstein substituted the attacking plane with an aircraft from "Wingmate of Doom" illustrated by [[Jerry Grandenetti]] in the subsequent issue (#90, April 1962),&lt;ref name="TPoL"/&gt; and that the target plane was borrowed from a [[Russ Heath]] drawing in the third panel of page 3 of the "Aces Wild" story in the same issue No. 89.&lt;ref name="TPoL"/&gt; The painting also omits the speech bubble from the source in which the pilot exclaims "The enemy has become a flaming star!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/feb/29/art|title= Whaam! but no Oomph!|accessdate=2013-08-05|date=29 February 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Cumming, Laura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichtenstein repeatedly depicted aerial combat between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=HWaW/&gt; In the early and mid-1960s, he produced "explosion" sculptures, taking subjects such as the "catastrophic release of energy" from paintings such as ''Whaam!'' and depicting them in freestanding and relief forms.{{sfn|Alloway|1983|p=56}} In 1963, he was parodying a variety of artworks, from advertising and comics and to "[[high culture|high art]]" modern masterpieces by [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and others.

The Lichtenstein Foundation website says that Lichtenstein began using his [[opaque projector]] technique in 1962.&lt;ref name="Chron"/&gt; in 1967 he described his process for producing comics-based art as follows:

{{Quote|text=I do them as directly as possible. If I am working from a cartoon, photograph or whatever, I draw a small picture—the size that will fit into my opaque projector&amp;nbsp;...

==Description==
''Whaam!'' depicts a fighter aircraft in the left panel firing a rocket into an enemy plane in the right panel, which disintegrates in a vivid red-and-yellow explosion. The cartoon style is emphasized by the use of the [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] lettering ''"WHAAM!"'' in the right panel, and a yellow-boxed caption with black lettering at the top of the left panel. The textual exclamation "WHAAM!" can be considered the graphic equivalent of a [[sound effect]].{{sfn|Waldman|1993|p=105}} This was to become a characteristic of his work—like others of his onomatopoeic paintings that contain exclamations such as ''[[Bratatat!]]'' and ''[[Varoom!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrporter.com/journal/journal_issue101/6#1|title=The Report: Mr Roy Lichtenstein|accessdate=2013-06-23|date=12 February 2013|publisher=MrPorter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Whaam!'' is one of Lichtenstein's series of war images, typically combining vibrant colors with an expressive narrative.{{sfn|Alloway|1983|p=20}} ''Whaam!'' is very large, measuring 1.7 m × 4.0 m (5&amp;nbsp;ft 7 in × 13&amp;nbsp;ft 4 in).&lt;ref name=Tate_Whaam/&gt; It is less abstract than ''As I Opened Fire'', another of his war scenes.{{sfn|Waldman|1993|p=105}} Lichtenstein employs his usual comic-book style: stereotyped imagery in bright primary colors with black outlines, coupled with imitations of mechanical printer's [[Ben-Day dots]].&lt;ref name="TAML"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Strickland, Carol  |author2=John Boswell |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Annotated Mona Lisa: A Crash Course in Art History from Prehistoric to Post-Modern| url = https://books.google.com/?id=n39T-zRGI90C&amp;pg=PA174| year = 2007| publisher = Andrews McMeel Publishing| isbn = 978-0-7407-6872-9| page = 174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of these dots, which were invented by Benjamin Day to simulate color variations and shading, are considered Lichtenstein's "signature method".&lt;ref name=RLfhtv/&gt; ''Whaam!'' departs from Lichtenstein's earlier diptychs such as ''Step-on-Can with Leg'' and ''Like New'', in that the panels are not two variations of the same image.{{sfn|Waldman|1993|p=104}}

Although Lichtenstein strove to remain faithful to the source images, he constructed his paintings in a traditional manner, starting with a sketch which he adjusted to improve the composition and then projected on to a canvas to make the finished painting.&lt;ref name=tatecomp/&gt; In the case of ''Whaam!'', the sketch is on two pieces of paper, and the finished work is painted with [[Magna (paint)|Magna]] [[acrylic paint|acrylic]] and [[oil paint]] on canvas.&lt;ref name="tatecat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lichtenstein-whaam-t00897/text-catalogue-entry|title=Catalogue entry|publisher=Tate Gallery|accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the transformation from a single-panel conception into a diptych painting occurred during the initial sketch, the final work varies from the sketch in several ways. The sketch suggests that the "WHAAM!" motif would be colored white, although it is yellow in the finished work.&lt;ref name=RLDfW1/&gt;&lt;ref name=CotTGCoMAotWbBA/&gt; Lichtenstein enlarged the main graphical subject of each panel (the plane on the left and the flames on the right), bringing them closer together as a result.&lt;ref name=CotTGCoMAotWbBA/&gt;

Lichtenstein built up the image with multiple layers of paint. The paint was applied using a scrub brush and handmade metal screen to produce Ben-Day dots via a process that left physical evidence behind.&lt;ref name=PApRLda7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1997/Pop-Art-pioneer-Roy-Lichtenstein-dead-at-73/id-43b85ac8a5a6ab361d2adb164e6a10ce|title=Pop Art pioneer Roy Lichtenstein dead at 73|accessdate=2013-06-15|date=29 September 1997|agency=[[Associated Press]]|author=Monroe, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=W&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/wow|title=WOW!, Lichtenstein: A Retrospective at Tate Modern II|author=Dunne, Nathan|journal=Tate Etc.|issue=27|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ben-Day dots technique enabled Lichtenstein to give his works a mechanically reproduced feel. Lichtenstein said that the work is "supposed to look like a fake, and it achieves that, I think".&lt;ref name=RLfhtv&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/23/roy-lichtenstein-heresy-to-visionary|title=Roy Lichtenstein: from heresy to visionary|accessdate=2013-07-26|date=22 February 2013|author=Churchwell, Sarah|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lichtenstein split the composition into two panels to separate the action from its consequence.{{sfn|Waldman|1993|p=104}} The left panel features the attacking plane—placed at a diagonal to create a sense of depth—below the text balloon, which Lichtenstein has relegated to the margin above the plane.{{sfn|Waldman|1993|p=104}} In the right panel, the exploding plane—depicted head-on—is outlined by the flames, accompanied by the bold exclamation "WHAAM!".{{sfn|Waldman|1993|p=104}} Although separate, with one panel containing the missile launch and the other its explosion, representing two distinct events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Art Since 1960|edition=second|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|author=Archer, Michael|isbn=978-0-500-20351-4|chapter=The Real and its Objects|year=2002|page=25|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the two panels are clearly linked spatially and temporally, not least by the horizontal smoke trail of the missile.{{sfn|Coplans|1972|p=39|ps=: "...&amp;nbsp;''Whaam I'' (1963), on the other hand, is a diptych with a clearly linked pictorial narrative&amp;nbsp;..."}} Lichtenstein commented on this piece in a 10 July 1967, letter: "I remember being concerned with the idea of doing two almost separate paintings having little hint of compositional connection, and each having slightly separate stylistic character. Of course there is the humorous connection of one panel shooting the other."{{sfn|Coplans|1972|p=164}}

Lichtenstein altered the composition to make the image more compelling, by making the exploding plane more prominent compared to the attacking plane than in the original.{{sfn|Waldman|1993|p=104}} The smoke trail of the missile becomes a horizontal line. The flames of the explosion dominate the right panel,{{sfn|Waldman|1993|p=104}} but the pilot and the airplane in the left panel are the narrative focus.{{sfn|Waldman|1993|p=105}} They exemplify Lichtenstein's painstaking detailing of physical features such as the aircraft's cockpit.&lt;ref name=TE&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[#refBader2009|Bader 2009]]|pages=123–124|chapter=Technology Envisioned: Lichtenstein's Monocularity|author=Lobel, Michael|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other element of the narrative content is a [[Speech balloon|text balloon]] that contains the following text: "I pressed the fire control&amp;nbsp;... and ahead of me rockets blazed through the sky&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="PApRLda7"/&gt; This is among the text believed to have been written by ''All-American Men of War'' editor [[Robert Kanigher]].&lt;ref name="TPoL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/jun/01/guardianobituaries.usa|title=Robert Kanigher: The man who put Sergeant Rock in a hard place|accessdate=2013-07-28|date=31 May 2002|author=Gravett, Paul|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WBaFS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.comicsgrid.com/2011/04/whaam-becoming-a-flaming-star/|title=Whaam!

Lichtenstein's borrowings from comics mimicked their style while adapting their subject matter.&lt;ref name=TGEoAA/&gt; He explained that "Signs and comic strips are interesting as subject matter. There are certain things that are usable, forceful and vital about commercial art."  Rebecca Bengal at [[PBS]] wrote that ''Whaam!'''s graphic clarity exemplifies the [[ligne claire]] style associated with [[Hergé]], a cartoonist whose influence Lichtenstein acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/tintinandi/special_tintinamerica.php#.UcDzjtjxGF9|title=Essay: Tintin in America|accessdate=2013-06-19|publication-date=2006-07-11|publisher=PBS|author=Bengal, Rebecca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein was attracted to using a cool, formal style to depict emotive subjects, leaving the viewer to interpret the artist's intention.&lt;ref name="tatecomp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/lichtenstein-whaam-t00897/text-illustrated-companion|title=Illustrated companion|publisher=Tate Gallery|accessdate=2013-07-19}} published in {{cite book| last = Wilson| first = Simon| title = Tate Gallery: An Illustrated Companion| edition = revised| year = 1991| publisher = Tate Gallery| isbn = 978-0-295-97039-4| page = 242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted a simplified color scheme and commercial printing-like techniques. The borrowed technique was "representing tonal variations with patterns of colored circles that imitated the half-tone screens of Ben Day dots used in newspaper printing, and surrounding these with black outlines similar to those used to conceal imperfections in cheap newsprint."&lt;ref name="TGEoAA"&gt;{{cite book| author =Busche, Ernst A.| title = The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art| url = https://books.google.com/?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;pg=RA2-PA158&amp;lpg=RA2-PA158&amp;dq=%22would+appear+to+accept+the+environment+as+revealed+by+his+reference+material+as+part+of+American+capitalist+industrial+culture%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22would%20appear%20to%20accept%20the%20environment%20as%20revealed%20by%20his%20reference%20material%20as%20part%20of%20American%20capitalist%20industrial%20culture%22&amp;f=false| year = 2011| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-533579-8| page = 158| editor = [[Joan Marter|Marter, Joan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein once said of his technique: "I take a cliche and try to organize its forms to make it monumental."&lt;ref name="PApRLda7"/&gt;

==Reception==
The painting was, for the most part, well received by art critics when first exhibited. A November 1963 ''Art Magazine'' review by [[Donald Judd]] described ''Whaam!'' as one of the "broad and powerful paintings" of the 1963 exhibition at Castelli's Gallery.&lt;ref name=RLOF4/&gt; In his review of the exhibition, ''[[The New York Times]]'' art critic [[Brian O'Doherty]] described Lichtenstein's technique as "typewriter pointillism&amp;nbsp;... that laboriously hammers out such moments as a jet shooting down another jet with a big BLAM". According to O'Doherty, the result was "certainly not art, [but] time may make it so", depending on whether it could be "rationalized&amp;nbsp;... and placed in line for the future to assimilate as history, which it shows every sign of doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=O'Doherty, Brian|date=27 October 1963|title=Lichtenstein: doubtful but definite triumph of the banal|work=[[The New York Times]]|page=21, section 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Surely there are more sources than this - its fairly mild praise - it must have been widely covered if the Tate moved in shortly afterwards--&gt; The [[Tate Gallery]] in London acquired the work in 1966, leading to heated argument amongst their trustees and some vocal members of the public. The purchase was made from art dealer [[Ileana Sonnabend]], whose asking price of £4,665 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|4665|1966}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} currency) was reduced by negotiation to £3,940 (£{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|3940|1966}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} currency).&lt;ref name="Bailey" /&gt; Some Tate trustees opposed the acquisition, among them sculptor [[Barbara Hepworth]], painter [[Andrew Forge]] and the poet and critic [[Herbert Read]].&lt;ref name="Bailey" /&gt; Defending the acquisition, art historian Richard Morphet, then an assistant [[Curator|keeper]] at the Tate, suggested that the painting addresses several issues and painterly styles at the same time: "history painting, Baroque extravagance, and the quotidian phenomenon of mass-circulation comic strips."&lt;ref name="www.bbc.com 20130717-pop-artist-or-copy-cat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130717-pop-artist-or-copy-cat|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2013-07-19|date=17 July 2013|title=Is Lichtenstein a great modern artist or a copy cat?|author=Sooke, Alistair}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' in 1967 described the acquisition as a "very large and spectacular painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spectacular piece of Pop art|work=[[The Times]]|date=3 January 1967|page=6, col E|issue=56829}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tate's director, [[Norman Reid (museum director)|Norman Reid]], later said that the work aroused more public interest than any of its acquisitions since World War II.&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/work-week-whaam-roy-lichtenstein|title=Work of the Week: Whaam! by Roy Lichtenstein|author=Holden, Duncan |publisher=Tate Gallery|accessdate=2013-07-19|date=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, ''Whaam!'' was included in the Tate's first solo exhibition of Lichtenstein's work.&lt;ref name="Holden" /&gt; The showing attracted 52,000 visitors, and was organized with the [[Stedelijk Museum]] in Amsterdam,&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Who+opposed+a+%C2%A34%2c665+Lichtenstein%3f/28512|title=Who opposed a £4,665 Lichtenstein?|author=Bailey, Martin|issue=243|accessdate=2013-02-19|date=13 February 2013|work=[[The Art Newspaper]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224221517/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Who+opposed+a+%C2%A34%2C665+Lichtenstein%3F/28512|archivedate=24 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later hosted the exhibition from 4 November to 17 December 1967, before it traveled to three other museums.&lt;ref name="Chron" /&gt;

==Analysis and interpretation==
For José Pierre, ''Whaam!'' represents Lichtenstein's 1963 expansion "into the 'epic' vein".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Pierre| first = José| title = An Illustrated History of Pop Art| year = 1977| publisher = Eyre Methuen| isbn = 978-0-413-38370-9| page = 91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Roberts, in a 1968 ''[[Burlington Magazine]]'' article, described the explosion as combining "''art nouveau'' elegance with a nervous energy reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Roberts, Keith|journal=[[The Burlington Magazine]]|volume=110|issue=779|date=February 1968|pages=107–108|title=Current and Forthcoming Exhibitions: London|jstor=875536}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wendy Steiner believes the work is Lichtenstein's most successful and harmonious comic-based composition. She sees the narrative and graphic elements as complementary: the action and spatial alignment lead the viewer's eye from left to right so as to emphasize the relationship between the action and its explosive consequence. The ellipses of the text balloon present a progression which culminates with a "WHAAM!". The "coincidence of pictorial and verbal order" are clear for the Western viewer with the explanatory text beginning in the upper left and action vector moving from the left foreground to the right background, culminating in a graphical explosion in tandem with a narrative exclamation.&lt;ref name="PoR"&gt;{{cite book| last = Steiner| first = Wendy| title = Pictures of Romance: Form against Context in Painting and Literature| url = https://books.google.com/?id=lFxCRvrm9zAC| year = 1987| publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 978-0-226-77229-5| pages = 161–164 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner says the striking incongruity of the two panels—the left panel appearing to be "truncated", while the right depicts a centralized explosion—enhances the work's narrative power.&lt;ref name=PoR/&gt;

[[File:Drawing for Whaam!.jpg|thumb|upright=1.82|Graphite-pencil-on-paper drawing entitled ''Drawing for {{'}}Whaam!{{'}}'' (1963), {{convert|14.9|x|30.5|cm|in|sp=us|abbr=on}}, was donated to the Tate in 1969. It shows the original plan was a single unified work.]]

Lichtenstein's technique has been characterized by Ernst A. Busche as "the enlargement and unification of his source material&amp;nbsp;... on the basis of strict artistic principles".&lt;ref name=TGEoAA/&gt; Extracted from a larger narrative, the resulting stylized image became in some cases a "virtual abstraction". By recreating their minimalistic graphic techniques, Lichtenstein reinforced the artificial nature of comic strips and advertisements. Lichtenstein's magnification of his source material made his impersonally drawn motifs seem all the more empty. Busche also says that although a critique of modern industrial America may be read into these images, Lichtenstein "would appear to accept the environment as revealed by his reference material as part of American capitalist industrial culture".&lt;ref name=TGEoAA/&gt;

David McCarthy contrasted Lichtenstein's "dispassionate, detached and oddly disembodied" presentation of aerial combat with the work of [[H.C. Westermann]], for whom the experience of military service in World War II instilled a need to horrify and shock. In contrast, Lichtenstein registers his "comment on American civilization" by scaling up inches-high comic book images to the oversized dimensions of [[history painting]].&lt;ref name=HWaW/&gt; Laura Brandon saw an attempt to convey "the trivialization of culture endemic in contemporary American life" by depicting a shocking scene of combat as a banal Cold War act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Brandon, Laura| title = Art and War| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3W-KbPNZD14C&amp;pg=PA84| year = 2007| publisher = I. B. Tauris| isbn = 978-1-84511-236-3| page = 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Strickland and John Boswell say that by magnifying the comic book panels to an enormous size with dots, "Lichtenstein slapped the viewer in the face with their triviality."&lt;ref name=TAML/&gt; H. H. Arnason noted that ''Whaam!'' presents "limited, flat colors and hard, precise drawing," which produce "a hard-edge subject painting that documents while it gently parodies the familiar hero images of modern America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Modern Art|edition=third|page=458|chapter=Pop Art, Assemblage, and Europe's New Realism|publisher=Prentice Hall, Inc./Harry N. Abrams, Inc.|author=Arnason, H. H.|year=1986|isbn=978-0-13-390360-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flat and highly finished style of planned brushstrokes can be seen as pop art's reaction against the looseness of abstract expressionism.&lt;ref name="HoMA"&gt;{{cite book| author = Arnason, H.

Abrams, Inc.| isbn = 978-0-8109-3439-9| pages = 538–540| chapter = Pop Art and Europe's New Realism }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alastair Sooke says that the work can be interpreted as a symbolic self-portrait in which the pilot in the left panel represents Lichtenstein "vanquishing his competitors in a dramatic art-world dogfight" by firing a missile at the colorful "parody of abstract painting" in the right panel.&lt;ref name="www.bbc.com 20130717-pop-artist-or-copy-cat"/&gt;

According to Ernesto Priego, while the work adapts a comic-book source, the painting is neither a comic nor a comics panel, and "its meaning is solely referential and [[post hoc theorizing|post hoc]]." It directs the attention of its audience to features such as genre and printing methods. Visually and narratively, the original panel was the climactic element of a dynamic page composition. Lichtenstein emphasizes the onomatopoeia while playing down articulated speech by removing the speech balloon. According to Priego, "by stripping the comics panel from its narrative context, ''Whaam!'' is representative in the realm of fine art of the preference of the image-icon over image-narrative".&lt;ref name=WBaFS/&gt;

''Whaam!'' is sometimes said to belong to the same anti-war genre as Picasso's ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', a suggestion dismissed by Bradford R. Collins. Instead, Collins views the painting as a revenge fantasy against Lichtenstein's first wife Isabel, conceived as it was during their bitter divorce battle (the couple separated in 1961 and divorced in 1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modern Romance: Lichtenstein's Comic Book Paintings|author=Collins, Bradford R.|journal=[[American Art (journal)|American Art]]|volume=17|issue=2|date=Summer 2003|pages=60–85|jstor=3109436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marla F. Prather observed that ''Whaam!'''s grand scale and dramatic depiction contributed to its position as a historic work of pop art.&lt;ref name=HoMA/&gt; With ''[[As I Opened Fire]]'', Lichtenstein's other monumental war painting, ''Whaam!'' is regarded as the culmination of Lichtenstein's dramatic war-comics works, according to Diane Waldman.{{sfn|Waldman|1993|p=95}} It is widely described as either Lichtenstein's most famous work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0319/p13s01-alar.html|title=Pop Art's one-hit wonder gets another look|accessdate=2013-08-09|date=19 March 2004|work=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|author=Rice-Oxley, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/may/09/whaam-roy-lichtensteins-comic-book-hour|title=Whaam!

Comic books were in turn affected by the cultural impact of pop art. By the mid-1960s, some comic books were displaying a new emphasis on garish colors, emphatic sound effects and stilted dialogue—the elements of comic book style that had come to be regarded as [[camp (style)|camp]]—in an attempt to appeal to older, college-age readers who appreciated pop art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Brooker| first = Will| title = Batman Unmasked: Analyzing a Cultural Icon| url = https://books.google.com/?id=GNRreYO91ogC&amp;pg=PA182| year = 2001| publisher = Bloomsbury Academic| isbn = 978-0-8264-1343-7| page = 182 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gravett observed that the "simplicity and outdatedness [of comic books] were ripe for being mocked".&lt;ref name="TPoL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/article/the_principality_of_lichtenstein|title=The Principality of Lichtenstein: From 'WHAAM!' to 'WHAAT?'|accessdate=2013-06-30|date=17 March 2013|author=Gravett, Paul|publisher=PaulGravett.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Whaam!'' was one of the key works exhibited in a major Lichtenstein retrospective in 2012–2013 that was designed, according to Li-mei Hoang, to demonstrate "the importance of Lichtenstein's influence, his engagement with art history and his enduring legacy as an artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-21/entertainment/sns-rt-us-art-britain-lichtensteinbre88k0oy-20120921_1_roy-lichtenstein-tate-modern-retrospective|title=Pop art pioneer Lichtenstein in Tate Modern retrospective|accessdate=2013-06-08|date=21 September 2012|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|author=Hoang, Li-mei}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of the Lichtenstein Retrospective at the [[Tate Modern]], [[Adrian Searle]] of ''[[The Guardian]]''—who was generally unenthusiastic about Lichtenstein's work—credited the work's title with accurately describing its graphic content: "Whaam! goes the painting, as the rocket hits, and the enemy fighter explodes in a livid, comic-book roar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/feb/18/roy-lichtenstein-tate-modern-retrospective|title=Roy Lichtenstein: too cool for school?|accessdate=2013-06-15|date=18 February 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|author=Searle, Adrian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' critic Alastair Smart wrote a disparaging review in which he acknowledged Lichtenstein's reputation as a leading figure in "Pop Art's cheeky assault on the swaggering, self-important Abstract Expressionists", whose works Smart said ''Whaam!'' mimicked by its huge scale. Smart said the work was neither a positive commentary on the fighting American spirit nor a critique, but was notable for marking "Lichtenstein's incendiary impact on the US art scene".&lt;ref name=smart/&gt;

Detractors have raised concerns over Lichtenstein's [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]], in that he directly references imagery from other sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/pop-art/appropriation|title=Pop Art|accessdate=2013-08-09|publisher=Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''Whaam!'' and other works of the period.&lt;ref name="TPoL" /&gt; Some have denigrated it as mere copying, to which others have countered that Lichtenstein altered his sources in significant, creative ways.&lt;ref name="www.bbc.com 20130717-pop-artist-or-copy-cat"/&gt; In response to claims of plagiarism, the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation has noted that publishers have never sued for [[copyright infringement]], and that they never raised the issue when Lichtenstein's comics-derived work first gained attention in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-11/entertainment/ct-ae-0513-roy-lichtenstein-20120511_1_roy-lichtenstein-comic-art-lichtenstein-show/2|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=2013-08-01|date=11 May 2012|title=Connecting the dots on Roy Lichtenstein retrospective at Art Institute: Is appropriation the sincerest form of flattery?|author=Borrelli, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other criticism centers on Lichtenstein's failure to credit the original artists of his sources;&lt;ref name="www.bbc.com 20130717-pop-artist-or-copy-cat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/may/image-duplicator-pop-arts-comic-theft |title=Image Duplicator: pop art's comic debt |accessdate=2013-06-18 |date=13 May 2013 |author=Steven, Rachael |work=[[Creative Review]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002013823/http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2013/may/image-duplicator-pop-arts-comic-theft |archivedate=2 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/02/02/deconstructing-lichtenstein-source-comics-revealed-and-credited/ |title=Deconstructing Lichtenstein: Source Comics Revealed and Credited |accessdate=2013-06-23 |date=2 February 2011 |author=Childs, Brian |publisher=Comics Alliance |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112223049/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/02/02/deconstructing-lichtenstein-source-comics-revealed-and-credited/ |archivedate=12 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ernesto Priego implicates National Periodicals in the case of ''Whaam!'', as the artists were never credited in the original comic books.&lt;ref name=WBaFS/&gt;

In [[Alastair Sooke]]'s 2013 [[BBC Four]] documentary that took place in front of ''Whaam!'' at the Tate Modern, British comic book artist [[Dave Gibbons]] disputed Sooke's assertion that Lichtenstein's painting improved upon Novick's panel, saying: "This to me looks flat and abstracted, to the point of view that to my eyes it's confusing. Whereas the original has got a three-dimensional quality to it, it's got a spontaneity to it, it's got an excitement to it, and a way of involving the viewer that this one lacks."&lt;ref name="TPoL"/&gt; Gibbons has parodied Lichtenstein's derivation of the Novick work.&lt;ref name="TPoL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bleedingcool.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/04/12/dave-gibbons-takes-on-roy-lichtenstein-for-the-hero-initiative-and-comica/ | title=Dave Gibbons Takes on Roy Lichtenstein for the HERO Initiative And Comica | work=[[Bleeding Cool]] | date=12 April 2013 | accessdate=27 September 2013 | author=Johnston, Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
