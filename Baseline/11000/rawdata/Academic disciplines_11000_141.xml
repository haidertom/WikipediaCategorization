'''Active defense''' can refer to a defensive [[strategy]] in the [[military]] or [[Computer security|cybersecurity]] arena.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] defines active defense as:  "The employment of limited offensive action and [[counterattack]]s to deny a contested area or position to the [[enemy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=37|title=U.S. DoD Terminology: active defense|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition does not specify whether it refers to physical actions, or cyber-related actions.

In the cybersecurity arena, active defense may mean "[[asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] defenses," namely defenses that increase costs to cyber-adversaries by reducing costs to cyber-defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.cryptomove.com/what-does-active-defense-mean-4ecff93c4bc4|title=What does ‘Active Defense’ mean?|last=Burshteyn|first=Mike|date=2016-12-22|newspaper=CryptoMove|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an active defense [[data protection]] strategy invented by CryptoMove&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cryptomove.com|title=CryptoMove {{!}} Active Defense Data Protection|last=|first=|date=|website=CryptoMove|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; leverages dynamic data movement, distribution, and [[encryption|re-encryption]] to make data harder to attack, steal, or destroy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cryptomove.com CryptoMove] invented such technology that protects data by constantly moving, distributing, mutating, and re-encrypting it.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior data protection approaches relied on [[encryption]] of data at rest, which leaves data vulnerable to attacks including [[ciphertext stealing|stealing of ciphertext]], [[cryptographic attack]], attacks on [[encryption keys]], destruction of encrypted data, [[ransomware]] attacks, insider attacks, and others. Three ACM computing conferences have explored Moving Target Defense as a strategy for network and application-level security as well, for instance by [[Rotation|rotating]] IP addresses or dynamically changing network [[topologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mtd.mobicloud.asu.edu/|title=Second ACM Workshop on Moving Target Defense (MTD 2015)|website=mtd.mobicloud.asu.edu|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production implementations of MTD are provided by companies such as Dispel for applications including legacy systems, communications, and election security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.securityweek.com/dispel-launches-election-security-platform|title=Dispel Launches Election Security Platform|website=securityweek.com|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have defined active defenses as including of [[deception]] or [[honeypot (computing)|honeypots]], which seek to confuse attackers with traps and advanced forensics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/detection/implementing-active-defense-systems-private-networks-34312|title=Implementing Active Defense Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=SANS White Paper|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such honeypot technologies include Illusive Networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.illusivenetworks.com/|title=illusive networks: The Leader In Deception Technology|website=www.illusivenetworks.com|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; TrapX,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://trapx.com/|website=trapx.com|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cymmetria,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cymmetria.com/|title=Home - Cymmetria|website=Cymmetria {{!}} Cyber deception|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attivo,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://attivonetworks.com/|title=Deception-Based Threat Detection - Attivo Networks|website=Attivo Networks|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Other types of active defenses might include automated incident response, which attempts to tie together different response strategies in order to increase work for attackers and decrease work for defenders.&lt;ref&gt;SANS WhitePaper on Incident Response and Active Defense, https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/detection/implementing-active-defense-systems-private-networks-34312&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and financial [[institution]]s have identified Active Defense as a top priority for security [[Infrastructure|industrial infrastructure]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=bbef769b0349f41d40d472d58b445306&amp;tab=core&amp;_cview=0|title=Financial Services Cyber Security Active Defense (FSCSAD) - Federal Business Opportunities: Opportunities|website=www.fbo.gov|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of a broader push for greater resiliency, the [[NIST|National Institute of Standards and Technology]] 800-160 Volume 2 framework has gone further, providing guidance on standardization for active defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/sp/800-160/vol-2/draft/documents/sp800-160-vol2-draft.pdf|title=Systems Security Engineering: Cyber Resiliency Considerations for the Engineering of Trustworthy Secure Systems|website=www.nist.gov|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Anaerobic.png|300px|thumb|right|Aerobic and anaerobic [[bacteria]] can be identified by growing them in test tubes of [[thioglycollate broth]]: &lt;br /&gt; 1: [[Obligate aerobe]]s need oxygen because they cannot ferment or respire anaerobically. They gather at the top of the tube where the oxygen concentration is highest. &lt;br /&gt; 2: [[Obligate anaerobe]]s are poisoned by oxygen, so they gather at the bottom of the tube where the oxygen concentration is lowest. &lt;br /&gt; 3: [[Facultative anaerobes]] can grow with or without oxygen because they can metabolise energy aerobically or anaerobically. They gather mostly at the top because aerobic respiration generates more ATP than either fermentation or anaerobic respiration. &lt;br /&gt; 4: [[Microaerophile]]s need oxygen because they cannot ferment or respire anaerobically. However, they are poisoned by high concentrations of oxygen. They gather in the upper part of the test tube but not the very top. &lt;br /&gt; 5: [[Anaerobic organism|Aerotolerant organisms]] do not require oxygen as they metabolise energy anaerobically. Unlike obligate anaerobes however, they are not poisoned by oxygen.  They can be found evenly spread throughout the test tube. ]]

An '''aerobic organism''' or '''aerobe''' is an [[organism]] that can survive and grow in an [[oxygen]]ated environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000002016|aerobe}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, an [[anaerobic organism]] (anaerobe) is any organism that does not require oxygen for growth. Some anaerobes react negatively or even die if oxygen is present.&lt;ref name=Hentges&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical Microbiology |edition=4 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7638/ |accessdate=24 July 2016 |author=Hentges DJ |chapter=17: Anaerobes:General Characteristics |editor=Baron S |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston |location = Galveston, Texas |date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
*'''[[Obligate aerobe]]s''' need oxygen to grow. In a process known as [[cellular respiration]], these organisms use oxygen to [[oxidation|oxidize]] substrates (for example [[sugar]]s and [[fat]]s) and generate [[energy]].&lt;ref name=Todar&gt;{{cite book|url=http://textbookofbacteriology.net/nutgro_4.html |accessdate=24 July 2016 |title=Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology |author=Kenneth Todar |chapter=Nutrition and Growth of Bacteria |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Facultative anaerobic organism|Facultative anaerobes]]''' use oxygen if it is available, but also have [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] methods of energy production.&lt;ref name=Hentges/&gt;
*'''[[Microaerophile]]s''' require oxygen for energy production, but are harmed by atmospheric concentrations of oxygen (21% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Todar/&gt;
*'''[[Aerotolerant|Aerotolerant anaerobes]]''' do not use oxygen but are not harmed by it.&lt;ref name=Todar/&gt;

When an organism is able to survive in both oxygen and anaerobic environments, the use of the [[Pasteur effect]] can distinguish between facultative anaerobes and aerotolerant organisms. If the organism is using fermentation in an anaerobic environment, the addition of oxygen will cause facultative anaerobes to suspend fermentation and begin using oxygen for respiration. Aerotolerant organisms must continue fermentation in the presence of oxygen.

==Glucose==
A good example is the oxidation of [[glucose]] (a [[monosaccharide]]) in [[aerobic metabolism|aerobic respiration]].
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 38 [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] + 38 phosphate →  6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 38 [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]

Oxygen is used during the oxidation of glucose and [[water]] is produced.&lt;ref name=Hentges/&gt;

This equation is a summary of what happens in three series of biochemical reactions: [[glycolysis]], the [[Krebs cycle]], and [[oxidative phosphorylation]].

'''Anticipatory democracy''' is a theory of [[civics]] relying on democratic [[decision making]] that takes into account [[futurology|predictions of future events]] that have some credibility with the electorate. The phrase was coined by [[Alvin Toffler]] in his book ''[[Future Shock]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=qsPgTpt_jrKEB5CI0IAF&amp;ct=result&amp;id=SvbQAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22Anticipatory+democracy%22&amp;q=Toffler#search_anchor | title=Anticipatory democracy | work=The Indian journal of public administration, Volume 26 | date=1980 | accessdate=December 8, 2011 | pages=879}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was expanded on in the 1978 book ''Anticipatory Democracy'', edited by [[Clement Bezold]].

Other well-known advocates of the anticipatory approach include [[Newt Gingrich]], [[Heidi Toffler]], [[K. Eric Drexler]], and [[Robin Hanson]]. They all advocate approaches where the public, not just experts, participate in this "anticipation".

The FutureMAP program of the [[Information Awareness Office]] program of the [[United States of America|United States]] government proposed a prediction market prior to its cancellation on July 29, 2003.

== Variants ==

[[Bioregional democracy]] can appear as a variant of anticipatory democracy in that it anticipates (using a similar scientific process) the [[ecological health]] outcomes of any given action. However it usually relies more on far less fragile means, and less on compared measures and quantities.

An alternative, [[deliberative democracy]], may combine with either the anticipatory or the bioregional model.  It relies less on formal models and a [[market system]] for betting on future events, and more on discussion.

Deliberative, anticipatory and bioregional approaches can all be considered variants of [[participatory democracy]] with different thresholds of ease of participation, [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]], concern for non-human life or future generations, and reflection of participants' tolerances versus preferences or ideals of [[truth]].  Sometimes a deliberative model is described as more [[left-wing politics|"left"]] and an anticipatory model as more [[right-wing politics|"right"]]. Those who wish to avoid this debate and see merits to both approaches, e.g. [[Green politics|Greens]], usually prefer the generic term "[[participatory democracy]]". This term has become fundamental to [[green politics]] itself.
 
Other terms which likewise have more specific associations with advocates or methods include: [[grassroots democracy]], [[semi-direct democracy]], [[consensus democracy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24600">An '''asymmetric cell division''' produces two daughter [[biological cell|cells]] with different cellular fates. This is in contrast to symmetric [[cell division]]s which give rise to daughter cells of equivalent fates. Notably, [[stem cell]]s divide asymmetrically to give rise to two distinct daughter cells: one copy of the original stem cell as well as a second daughter programmed to differentiate into a non-stem cell fate. (In times of growth or regeneration, stem cells can also divide symmetrically, to produce two identical copies of the original cell.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite journal

In principle, there are two mechanisms by which distinct properties may be conferred on the daughters of a dividing cell. In one, the daughter cells are initially equivalent but a difference is induced by [[Cell signaling|signaling]] between the cells, from surrounding cells, or from the precursor cell.  This mechanism is known as extrinsic asymmetric cell division. In the second mechanism, the prospective daughter cells are inherently different at the time of division of the mother cell. Because this latter mechanism does not depend on interactions of cells with each other or with  their environment, it must rely on [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|''intrinsic'']] asymmetry. The term '''asymmetric cell division''' usually refers to such intrinsic asymmetric divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = Nancy | last2 = Garriga | first2 = Gian | year = 1998 | title = Asymmetric cell division: from A to Z | url = | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 12 | issue = 23| pages = 3625–38 | doi=10.1101/gad.12.23.3625| pmid = 9851969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intrinsic asymmetry ==

In multi-celled organisms this mechanism raises two requirements: first, the mother cell must be [[Cell polarity|polarized]]; second, the [[mitotic spindle]] must be aligned with the axis of polarity. The [[cell biology]] of these events has been most traditionally studied in three animal models: the mouse, the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' and the fruitfly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''. Recent work in [[spiralia]]n development has also discovered insightful mechanisms of asymmetric cell division.

In ''C. elegans'', a series of asymmetric cell divisions in the early embryo are critical in setting up the anterior/posterior, dorsal/ventral, and left/right axes of the body plan.&lt;ref&gt;Gönczy, P. and Rose, L.S.

The ''C. elegans'' Research Community, WormBook, doi/10.1895/wormbook.1.30.1, [http://www.wormbook.org]&lt;/ref&gt; After fertilization, events are already occurring in the one cell stage embryo to allow for the first asymmetric cell division. This first division produces two distinctly different blastomeres, termed AB and P1. When the sperm fertilizes the egg, the sperm nucleus and centrosomes are deposited within the egg, which causes a cytoplasmic flux resulting in the movement of the sperm pronucleus and centrosomes towards one pole.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, B, Hird, SN. "Specification of the anteroposterior axis in Caenorhabditis elegans." Development 1996. 122:1467–74.&lt;/ref&gt; The centrosomes deposited by the sperm seem to be responsible for the establishment of the posterior pole within the one cell embryo. Studies have shown that the pole in which the sperm-derived centrosomes reside always becomes the posterior pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cowan | first1 = C | last2 = Hyman | first2 = A | year = 2004 | title = Centrosomes direct cell polarity independently of microtubule assembly in C. elegans embryos | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7004| pages = 92–96 | doi=10.1038/nature02825| pmid = 15343338 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sperm with mutant or absent centrosomes fail to establish a posterior pole, while enucleated sperm with intact centrosomes successfully fertilize the egg and set up the posterior pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O' | last2 = Connell | first2 = K.

This series of events allows the single celled zygote to obtain polarity through an unequal distribution of multiple factors.

The single cell is now set up to undergo an asymmetric cell division, however the orientation in which the division occurs is also an important factor. The mitotic spindle must be oriented correctly to ensure that the proper cell fate determinants are distributed appropriately to the daughter cells. The alignment of the spindle is mediated by the PAR proteins, which regulate the positioning of the centrosomes along the A/P axis as well as the movement of the mitotic spindle along the A/P axis.&lt;ref&gt;Gönczy, P. and Rose, L.S.

The ''C. elegans'' Research Community, WormBook, {{DOI|10.1895/wormbook.1.30.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this first asymmetric division, the AB daughter cell divides symmetrically, giving rise to ABa and ABp, while the P1 daughter cell undergoes another asymmetric cell division to produce P2 and EMS. This division is also dependent on the distribution of the PAR proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = SQ | last2 = Bowerman | first2 = B | year = 2003 | title = Cell polarity and the cytoskeleton in the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote | url = | journal = Annu Rev Genet | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 221–49 | pmid = 14616061 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.37.110801.142443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Asymmetric cell division in ''Drosophila'' neural development ==

[[File:asymmetric cell division neuroblast.jpg|thumb|Numb (blue) is asymmetrically distributed within the neuroblast. Following cell division, the GMC contains the Numb protein which suppresses Notch signaling. The other daughter cell is receptive to Notch signaling, causing distinct cellular responses, and ultimately two distinct cell fates between the daughter cells.]]

In ''Drosophila melanogaster'', asymmetric cell division plays an important role in neural development. Neuroblasts are the progenitor cells which divide asymmetrically to give rise to another neuroblast and a ganglion mother cell (GMC). The neuroblast repeatedly undergoes this asymmetric cell division while the GMC continues on to produce a pair of neurons. Two proteins play an important role in setting up this asymmetry in the neuroblast, Prospero and Numb. These proteins are both synthesized in the neuroblast and segregate into only the GMC during divisions.&lt;ref name="Matsuzaki, F. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Matsuzaki | first1 = F | year = 2000 | title = Asymmetric division of ''Drosophila'' neural stem cells: a basis for neural diversity | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 38–44 | doi=10.1016/s0959-4388(99)00052-5| pmid = 10679433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numb is a suppressor of Notch, therefore the asymmetric segregation of Numb to the basal cortex biases the response of the daughter cells to Notch signaling, resulting in two distinct cell fates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guo | first1 = M | last2 = Jan | first2 = LY | last3 = Jan | first3 = YN | year = 1996 | title = Control of daughter cell fates during asymmetric division: interaction of Numb and Notch | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 27–41 | doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80278-0| pmid = 8755476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospero is required for gene regulation in GMCs. It is equally distributed throughout the neuroblast cytoplasm, but becomes localized at the basal cortex when the neuroblast starts to undergo mitosis. Once the GMC buds off from the basal cortex, Prospero becomes translocated into the GMC nucleus to act as a transcription factor.&lt;ref name="Matsuzaki, F. 2000" /&gt;

Other proteins present in the neuroblast mediate the asymmetric localization of Numb and Prospero. Miranda is an anchoring protein that binds to Prospero and keeps it in the basal cortex. Following the generation of the GMC, Miranda releases Prospero and then becomes degraded.&lt;ref name="Matsuzaki, F. 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ikeshima-Kataoka | first1 = H | last2 = Skeath | first2 = JB | last3 = Nabeshima | first3 = Y | last4 = Doe | first4 = CQ | last5 = Matsuzaki | first5 = F | year = 1997 | title = Miranda directs Prospero to a daughter cell during ''Drosophila'' asymmetric divisions | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 390 | issue = 6660| pages = 625–29 |pmid=9403694|doi=10.1038/37641}}&lt;/ref&gt; The segregation of Numb is mediated by Pon (the partner of Numb protein). Pon binds to Numb and colocalizes with it during neuroblast cell division.&lt;ref name="Matsuzaki, F. 2000" /&gt;

The mitotic spindle must also align parallel to the asymmetrically distributed cell fate determinants to allow them to become segregated into one daughter cell and not the other. The mitotic spindle orientation is mediated by Inscuteable, which is segregated to the apical cortex of the neuroblast. Without the presence of Inscuteable, the positioning of the mitotic spindle and the cell fate determinants in relationship to each other becomes randomized. Inscuteable mutants display a uniform distribution of Miranda and Numb at the cortex, and the resulting daughter cells display identical neuronal fates.&lt;ref name="Matsuzaki, F. 2000" /&gt;

== Asymmetric cell division in Spiralian development ==

[[Spiralia]] (commonly synonymous with [[lophotrochozoa]]) represent a diverse clade of animals whose species comprise the bulk of the bilaterian animals present today.  Examples include [[mollusk]]s, [[annelid worm]]s, and the [[entoprocta]].  Although much is known at the cellular and molecular level about the other bilateralian clades ([[ecdysozoa]] and [[deuterostomia]]), research into the processes that govern spiralian development is comparatively lacking.  However, one unifying feature shared among spiralia is the pattern of cleavage in the early embryo known as [[Cleavage (embryo)|spiral cleavage]].&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Henry | first1 = Jonathan J. | last2 = Martindale | first2 = Mark Q. | year = 1999 | title = Conservation and innovation in spiralian development | url = | journal = Hydrobiologia | volume = 402 | issue = | pages = 255–65 | doi=10.1007/978-94-017-2887-4_15| isbn = 978-90-481-5340-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanisms of asymmetric division''' (See Figure, right panel):

[[File:Asymmetric cell division.jpg|thumb|Asymmetric cell division is integral during development. In spiralia, the first cleavage can be either symmetric or asymmetric, as shown in the left panel. Asymmetry can be accomplished through simple unequal segregation of cell fate determinants across a single plane, through sequestration of cell fate determinants in a polar lobe which is absorbed by one of the daughter cells, or a combination of both processes. The right panel summarizes the mechanisms of spiralian asymmetric cleavage discussed here. Red features indicate the molecule(s) implicated in establishing asymmetry.]]

*Tubifex tubifex: The sludge worm ''[[Tubifex tubifex]]'' has been shown to demonstrate an interesting asymmetric cell division at the point of first embryonic cleavage.  Unlike the classic idea of cortical differences at the zygotic membrane that determine spindle asymmetry in the ''C. elegans'' embryo, the first cleavage in tubifex relies on the number of [[centrosome]]s.&lt;ref name=Shimizu&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shimizu | first1 = T. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1998 | title = Unequal Cleavage in the early Tubifex Embryo | url = | journal = Develop. Growth Differ | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 257–66 | doi=10.1046/j.1440-169x.1998.00001.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Embryos inherit a single centrosome which localizes in the prospective larger CD cell cytoplasm and emits radial microtubules during anaphase that contribute to both the mitotic spindle as well as cortical asters.  However, the microtubule organizing center of the prospective smaller AB cell emits only microtubules that commit to the mitotic spindle and not cortical bound asters.  When embryos are compressed or deformed, asymmetric spindles still form, and staining for gamma tubulin reveals that the second microtubule organizing center lacks the molecular signature of a centrosome.  Furthermore, when centrosome number is doubled, ''tubifex'' embryos cleave symmetrically, suggesting this monoastral mechanism of asymmetric cell division is centrosome dependent.&lt;ref name=Shimizu /&gt;
*Helobdella robusta: The leech ''[[Helobdella robusta]]'' exhibits a similar asymmetry in the first embryonic division as ''C. elegans'' and ''tubifex'', but relies on a modified mechanism.  Compression experiments on the robusta embryo do not affect asymmetric division, suggesting the mechanism, like tubifex, uses a cortical independent molecular pathway.  In robusta, antibody staining reveals that the mitotic spindle forms symmetrically until metaphase and stems from two biastral centrosomes.&lt;ref name=Ren&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ren | first1 = Xiaoyun | last2 = Weisblat | first2 = David A. | year = 2006 | title = Asymmetrization of first cleavage by transient disassembly of one spindle pole aster in the leech Helobdella robusta | url = | journal = Developmental Biology | volume = 292 | issue = 1| pages = 103–15 | doi=10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.12.049| pmid = 16458880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the onset of metaphase, asymmetry becomes apparent as the centrosome of the prospective larger CD cell lengthens cortical asters while the asters of the prospective smaller AB cell become downregulated.  Experiments using [[nocodazole]] and [[taxol]] support this observation.  Taxol, which stabilized microtubules, forced a significant number of embryos to cleave symmetrically when used at a moderate concentration.  Moreover, embryos treated with nocodazole, which sequesters tubulin dimers and promotes microtubule depolymerization, similarly forced symmetric division in a significant number of embryos.  Treatment with either drug at these concentrations fails to disrupt normal centrosome dynamics, suggesting that a balance of microtubule polymerization and depolymerization represents another mechanism for establishing asymmetric cell division in spilarian development.&lt;ref name=Ren /&gt;
*Ilyanasa obsoleta: A third, less traditional mechanism contributing to asymmetric cell division in spiralian development has been discovered in the mollusk ''[[Ilyanasa obsoleta]]''.  [[In situ hybridization]] and [[immunofluorescence]] experiments show that mRNA transcripts co-localize with centrosomes during early cleavage.&lt;ref name=Lambert&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lambert | first1 = J. David | last2 = Nagy | first2 = Lisa M. | year = 2002 | title = Asymmetric inheritance of centrosomally localized mRNAs during embryonic cleavages | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 420 | issue = 6916| pages = 682–86|pmid=12478296|doi=10.1038/nature01241}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Consequently, these transcripts are inherited in a stereotypical fashion to distinct cells.  All mRNA transcripts followed have been implicated in body axis patterning, and in situ hybridization for transcripts associated with other functions fail to exhibit such a localization.  Moreover, disruption of microtubule polymerization with nocodazole, and of actin polymerization with cytochalisin B, shows the cytoskeleton is also important in this asymmetry.  It appears that microtubules are required to recruit the mRNA to the centrosome, and that actin is required to attach the centrosome to the cortex.  Finally, introducing multiple centrosomes into one cell by inhibiting cytokinesis shows that mRNA dependably localizes on the correct centrosome, suggesting intrinsic differences between each centrosomal composition.  It is important to note that these results reflect experiments performed after the first two divisions, yet still demonstrate a different molecular means of establishing asymmetry in a dividing cell.&lt;ref name=Lambert /&gt;

== Asymmetric division in stem cells and progenitors ==

Animals are made up of a vast number of distinct [[cell type]]s. During development, the [[zygote]] undergoes many cell divisions that give rise to various cell types, including embryonic stem cells. Asymmetric divisions of these embryonic cells gives rise to one cell of the same potency ([[self-renewal]]), and another that maybe of the same potency or stimulated to further differentiate into specialized cell types such as neurons. This stimulated differentiation arises from many factors which can be divided into two broad categories: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic factors generally involve differing amounts of cell-fate determinants being distributed into each daughter cell. Extrinsic factors involve interactions with neighboring cells and the micro and macro environment of the precursor cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jan, Y. N. |title=Asymmetric cell division |author2=Jan, L. Y. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Nature|year=1998|volume=392|issue=6678 |pages=775–778|doi=10.1038/33854 |pmid=9572136 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the aforementioned Drosophila neuronal example, it was proposed that the macrosensory organs of the Drosophila, specifically the glial cells, also arise from a similar set of asymmetric division from a single progenitor cell via regulation of the [[Notch signaling pathway]] and [[transcription factors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gho, M. |author2=Bellaiche, Y. |author3=Schweisguth, F.|title=Revisiting the Drosophila microchaete lineage: a novel intrinsically asymmetric cell division generates a glial cell|journal=Development|year=1999|volume=126|pages=573–3584}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of how extrinsic factors bring about this phenomenon is the physical displacement of one of the daughter cells out of the original stem cell niche, exposing it to signalling molecules such as [[chondroitin sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes, A. J. |author2=Tudor, D. |author3=Nowell, M. A. |author4=Caterson, B. |author5=Hughes, C. E|title=Chondroitin sulfate sulfation motifs as putative biomarkers for isolation of articular cartilage progenitor cells|journal=J Histochem Cytochem|year=2008|volume=56 |issue=2|pages=125–138|doi=10.1369/jhc.7a7320.2007|pmid=17938280|pmc=2324172}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this manner, the daughter cell is forced to interact with the heavily sulfated molecules, which stimulate it to differentiate while the other daughter cell remains in the original niche in a quiescent state.

== Role of asymmetric cell division in disease ==

In normal stem and [[progenitor]] cells, asymmetric cell division balances proliferation and self-renewal with [[Cell cycle|cell-cycle]] exit and differentiation. Disruption of asymmetric cell division leads to aberrant self-renewal and impairs [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], and could therefore constitute an early step in the tumorogenic transformation of stem and progenitor cells. In normal non-tumor stem cells, a number of genes have been described which are responsible for pluripotency, such as [[Bmi-1]], [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]] and [[Notch signaling pathway|Notch]]. These genes have been discovered also in the case of cancer stem cells, and shows that their aberrant expression is essential for the formation of tumor cell mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00018-013-1386-1|pmid=23771628|title=Asymmetric cell division of stem and progenitor cells during homeostasis and cancer|journal=Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences|volume=71|issue=4|pages=575–97|year=2013|last1=Gómez-López|first1=Sandra|last2=Lerner|first2=Robin G.|last3=Petritsch|first3=Claudia|pmc=3901929}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it has been shown that [[gastrointestinal cancer]]s contain rare subpopulation of cancer stem cells which are capable to divide asymmetrically. The asymmetric division in these cells is regulated by cancer niche (microenvironment) and Wnt pathway.

Another [[mutation]] in asymmetric cell divisions which are involved in tumor growth are loss-of-function mutations. The first suggestion that loss of asymmetric cell division might be involved in tumorigenesis came from studies of [[Drosophila]]. Studies of loss-of-function mutations in key regulators of asymmetric cell division including lgl, aurA, polo, numb and brat, revealed hyperproliferative [[phenotypes]] in situ. In these mutants cells divide more symmetrically and generate mis-specified progeny that fail to exit the cell cycle and differentiate, but rather proliferate continuously and form a tumor cell mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gonzalez | first1 = C. | year = 2007 | title = Spindle orientation, asymmetric division and tumour suppression in Drosophila stem cells | url = | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 8 | issue = 6| pages = 462–72 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2103 | pmid = 17510666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Biosensors based on type of biotransducers.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|Biosensors based on type of biotransducers]] A '''biotransducer''' is the recognition-transduction component of a biosensor system. It consists of two intimately coupled parts; a bio-recognition layer and a physicochemical transducer, which acting together converts a biochemical signal to an electronic or optical signal. The bio-recognition layer typically contains an [[enzyme]] or another binding protein such as [[antibody]]. However, [[oligonucleotide]] sequences, sub-cellular fragments such as organelles (e.g. [[mitochondria]]) and receptor carrying fragments (e.g. [[cell wall]]), single whole cells, small numbers of cells on synthetic scaffolds, or thin slices of animal or plant tissues, may also comprise the bio-recognition layer. It gives the [[biosensor]] selectivity and specificity. The physicochemical transducer is typically in intimate and controlled contact with the recognition layer. As a result of the presence and biochemical action of the analyte (target of interest), a physico-chemical change is produced within the biorecognition layer that is measured by the physicochemical transducer producing a signal that is proportionate to the concentration of the analyte.&lt;ref name=ElectrochemicalGlucoseBiosensor&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = J. | title = Electrochemical Glucose Biosensors | doi = 10.1021/cr068123a | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 814–825 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18154363| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The physicochemical transducer may be electrochemical, optical, electronic, gravimetric, pyroelectric or piezoelectric. Based on the type of biotransducer, biosensors can be classified as shown to the right.

== Electrochemical biotransducers ==

Electrochemical biosensors contain a biorecognition element that selectively reacts with the target analyte and produces an electrical signal that is proportional to the analyte concentration. In general, there are several approaches that can be used to detect electrochemical changes during a biorecognition event and these can be classified as follows: amperometric, potentiometric, impedance, and conductometric.

===Amperometric===
Amperometric transducers detect change in current as a result of electrochemical oxidation or reduction. Typically, the bioreceptor molecule is immobilized on the [[working electrode]] (commonly gold, carbon, or platinum). The potential between the working electrode and the [[reference electrode]] (usually Ag/AgCl) is fixed at a value and then current is measured with respect to time. The applied potential is the driving force for the electron transfer reaction. The current produced is a direct measure of the rate of electron transfer.  The current reflects the reaction occurring between the bioreceptor molecule and analyte and is limited by the mass transport rate of the analyte to the electrode.

===Potentiometric===
Potentiometric sensors measure a potential or charge accumulation of an [[electrochemical cell]]. The transducer typically comprises an ion selective electrode (ISE) and a reference electrode.  The ISE features a membrane that selectively interacts with the charged ion of interest, causing the accumulation of a charge potential compared to the reference electrode. The reference electrode provides a constant half-cell potential that is unaffected by analyte concentration. A high impedance voltmeter is used to measure the electromotive force or potential between the two electrodes when zero or no significant current flows between them. The potentiometric response is governed by the [[Nernst equation]] in that the potential is proportional to the logarithm of the concentration of the analyte.

===Impedance===
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) involves measuring resistive and capacitive changes caused by a biorecognition event. Typically, a small amplitude sinsusoidal electrical stimulus is applied, causing current to flow through the biosensor. The frequency is varied over a range to obtain the impedance spectrum. The resistive and capacitive components of impedance are determined from in phase and out of phase current responses. Typically, a conventional three-electrode system is made specific to the analyte by immobilizing a biorecognition element to the surface. A voltage is applied and the current is measured. The interfacial impedance between the electrode and solution changes as a result of the analyte binding. An impedance analyzer can be used to control and apply the stimulus as well as measure the impedance changes.

===Conductometry===
Conductometric sensing involves measuring the change in conductive properties of the sample solution or a medium. The reaction between the biomolecule and analyte changes the ionic species concentration, leading to a change in the solution electrical conductivity or current flow. Two metal electrodes are separated at a certain distance and an AC potential is applied across the electrodes, causing a current flow between the electrodes. During a biorecognition event the ionic composition changes, using an ohmmeter the change in conductance can be measured.

== Optical biotransducers ==
Optical biotransducers, used in optical biosensors for signal transduction, use photons in order to collect information about analyte.&lt;ref&gt;Sergey M. Borisov, Otto S. Wolfbeis, Optical Biosensors, Chemical Reviews, 2008, Vol. 108, No. 2&lt;/ref&gt; These are highly sensitive, highly specific, small in size and cost effective.

The detection mechanism of optical biotransducer depends upon the enzyme system that converts analyte into products which are either oxidized or reduced at the working electrode.&lt;ref&gt;Ligler, Frances S.; Rowe Taitt, Chris A. Optical Biosensors - Present &amp; Future. Elsevier.2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Evanescent field detection principle is most commonly used in an optical biosensor system as the transduction principle . This principle is one of the most sensitive detection methods. It enables the detection of fluorophores exclusively in the close proximity of the optical fiber.
&lt;ref&gt;A. P. Abel, M. G. Weller, G. L. Duveneck, M. Ehrat, M. Widmer, “ Fiber-optic Evanescent Wave Biosensors for the Detection of Oligonucleotides” Anal. Chem, 1996, 68, 2905-2912.&lt;/ref&gt;

== FET-based electronic biotransducers ==
Electronic biosensing offers significant advantages over optical, biochemical and biophysical methods, in terms of high sensitivity and new sensing mechanisms, high spatial resolution for localized detection, facile integration with standard wafer-scale semiconductor processing and label-free, real-time detection in a nondestructive manner [6].

Devices based on field-effect transistors (FETs) have attracted great attention because they can directly translate the interactions between target biological molecules and the FET surface into readable electrical signals. In a FET, current flows along the channel which is connected to the source and the drain. The channel conductance between the source and the drain is switched on and off by gate electrode that is capacitively coupled through a thin dielectric layer [6].

In FET-based biosensors, the channel is in direct contact with the environment, and this gives better control over the surface charge. This improves the sensitivity of surface FET-based biosensors as biological events occurring at the channel surface could result in the surface potential variation of the semiconductor channel and then modulate the channel conductance. In addition to ease of on-chip integration of device arrays and the cost-effective device fabrication, the surface ultrasensitivity of FET-based biosensors makes it an attractive alternative to existing biosensor technologies[6].

== Gravimetric/Piezoelectric biotransducers ==
Gravimetric biosensors use the basic principle of a response to a change in mass.  Most gravimetric biosensors use thin piezoelectric quartz crystals, either as resonating crystals ([[Quartz crystal microbalance|QCM]]), or as bulk/surface acoustic wave ([[Surface acoustic wave|SAW]]) devices. In the majority of these the mass response is inversely proportional to the crystal thickness. Thin polymer films are also used in which biomolecules can be added to the surface with known surface mass.  [[Acoustic wave]]s can be projected to the thin film to produce an oscillatory device, which then follows an equation that is nearly identical to the Sauerbrey equation used in the QCM method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=P.W. Walton|author2=M.R. O'Flaherty|author3=M.E. Butler|author4=P. Compton|title=Gravimetric biosensors based on acoustic waves in thin polymer films|journal=Biosensors and Bioelectronics|year=1993|volume=8|issue=9-10|pages=401–407|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/095656639380024J|accessdate=12 November 2013|doi=10.1016/0956-5663(93)80024-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Biomolecules, such as proteins or antibodies can bind and its change in mass gives a measureable signal proportional to the presence of the target analyte in the sample.

== Pyroelectric biotransducers ==
Pyroelectric biosensors generate an electric current as a result of a temperature change.  This differential induces a [[Electrical polarity|polarization]] in the substance, producing a [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moment]] in the direction of the temperature gradient.  The result is a net voltage across the material.  This net voltage can be calculated by the following equation.&lt;ref&gt;Heimlich et al. Biosensor technology: Fundamentals and applications, Marcel Dekker, INC.: New York, 1990. PP. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta V = \omega PAr\Delta T\left(1+\omega^2\tau_E^2\right)^{-1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\tau_E=rC&lt;/math&gt;

ω = angular frequency of the modulated incident,

ε = film dielectric constant,
A = area of film,
r = resistance of the film,
C = capacitance of the film,

There was a succession of '''Soviet secret police agencies''' over time. The first [[secret police]] after the [[October Revolution]], created by [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s decree on December 20, 1917, was called "[[Cheka]]" (ЧК). Officers were referred to as "chekists", a name that is still informally applied to people under the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]] of [[Russia]], the [[KGB]]'s successor in Russia after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

For most agencies listed here secret policing operations were only part of their function; for instance, the [[KGB]] was both the secret police and the [[intelligence agency]].

May 30, 1947: Official decision with the expressed purpose of "upgrading coordination of different intelligence services and concentrating their efforts on major directions". In the summer of 1948 the military personnel in KI were returned to the [[Soviet military]] to reconstitute foreign military intelligence service ([[GRU]]). KI sections dealing with the new [[East Bloc]] and Soviet émigrés were returned to the MGB in late 1948. In 1951 the KI returned to the MGB.

March 5, 1953: MVD and MGB are merged into the MVD by [[Lavrentiy Beria]].

In 1991, after the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|State Emergency Committee]] failed to overthrow [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] and [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]] took over, General [[Vadim Bakatin]] was given instructions to dissolve the KGB.

In Russia today, KGB functions are performed by the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)]], the [[Federal Security Service]] of the Russian Federation (FSB), and the [[Federal Protective Service (Russia)|Federal Protective Service (FSO)]]. The [[Main Intelligence Directorate|GRU]] continues to operate as well.

The '''Commonwealth of World Citizens''' (later named 'Mondcivitan Republic' after the [[Esperanto]]) was founded by [[Hugh J. Schonfield]], an associate of [[H.G. Wells]], in 1956. The organisation describes itself as  a '''servant-Nation'''.&lt;ref&gt;The politics of God Hugh Joseph Schonfield - 1970 "There shall be identical treatment of those outside the Commonwealth as of those within it, treatment that is founded on reverence for the human personality. 3. The Commonwealth of World Citizens shall ever promote and actively assist ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World citizenship and mundialism: a guide to the building of a ... - Page 23 John Charles de Villamar Roberts - 1999 "The Commonwealth of World Citizens offered itself as an example of a new "nation" devoted solely to serving humanity. Its founder, Dr. Hugh Schonfield, a distinguished Biblical scholar, had worked for world citizenship and mundialism ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Hugh Schonfield&lt;ref&gt;For a complete biography of Hugh Schonfield see: Engelking S.A. (2017) "A Life for Mankind - The Biography of Hugh Joseph Schonfield" - The Hugh &amp; Helene Schonfield World Service Trust {{ISBN|978 199 986 9106}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a biblical scholar, who was later best known for his book ''The Passover Plot.''&lt;ref&gt;No Sense of Obligation: Science and Religion in an Impersonal Universe - Page 141 Matt Young - 2001 "Hugh Schonfield was a New Testament scholar who was educated at King's College, London, and earned a doctorate in sacred literature at the University of Glasgow. He was a prolific author but received attention mostly for The Passover Plot..."&lt;/ref&gt; Schonfield first felt the need for an organisation for the service of all nations as far back as 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Alternative approaches to world government Hanna Newcombe - 1967 "The Commonwealth of World Citizens, or Mondcivitans , was founded long before [[Garry Davis]]. In 1938, Dr. Hugh Schonfield, distinguished British Jewish scholar and diplomat, conceived the civilized world's need for a new "independent and ...&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1938 to 1950 Schonfield examined various aspects of the project, including questions of international law.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Schonfield came up with the idea of a body of persons from different countries which would have relations with the governments of other countries, without that organisation holding any territory itself. When the [[United Nations]] was formed, Schonfield wrote to the [[Secretary-General]] and to all the states party to the charter of his desire to form his Mondcivitan Republic. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the summer of 1951, a General Assembly of the organisation's members was held in [[Paris]], which appointed a Secretariat as the acting administration with offices in [[London]]. By 1952 the organisation had members in 14 countries, by 1954 in 25 countries and by 1955 in 30 countries. The second General Assembly in 1953 set up a commission to draft the text of the constitution of the organisation. Following amendments at the third General Assembly in 1955, the organisation's provisional [[Constitution]] was approved for adoption. In the same year [[humanitarian]] activities were initiated by the creation of the World Service Trust as a specialised agency of the organisation.

[[Caresse Crosby]] merged her group with the Commonwealth of World Citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The Cramoisy Queen: A Life of [[Caresse Crosby]] - Page 168 Linda Hamalian - 2009 All that was required, she thought, was formal official status, and so she merged with the legally established Commonwealth of World Citizens founded by Dr. Hugh Schonfield, a British historian and scholar of what the West called the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideals===
The organisation arose from the need felt by members throughout the world to give organic expression to the idea of the fundamental unity of the human race by developing a common way of life and government, which experimentally would be a preparation by example for a co-operative [[World community]] embracing all peoples.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The organisation was to consist of all its members at any given time, without regard for colour or ethnic origin. In its political expression it was a free and self-governing organisation and ''world community''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The new organisation expressed the goal of world unity and human fraternity. The idea was that the organisation should advocate for international reconciliation and the resolution of international problems and conflicts. The loyalty it demanded was higher than that given to any state, requiring in the individual full dedication to the principles and purposes of the new nation, yet at the initial stage without forfeiting state [[citizenship]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

For the members, state citizenship was to be always secondary to membership within the organisation. Any member was expected to be primarily concerned with the affairs and policies of the organisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Taking part in war, aggression of oppression was strictly prohibited and the member was supposed to be prepared to suffer the penalties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} All members were expected to live and abide by a set of seven principles:{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
* No-one is an Enemy
* No-one is a Foreigner
* Service to All
* Complete Impartiality
* Work for Peace
* True [[Democracy]]
* Equity and Justice

==''The Republic''==
With members in 33 countries it was decided in 1956 that the ''Mondcivitan Republic'' should be proclaimed in being ''de facto'' and that all governments should be advised accordingly and furnished with a copy of the constitution.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} A Constituent Assembly of the organisation's members was convened at the [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff]], headquarters of the [[United Nations Association]] in [[Wales]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The organisation's constitution was adopted on August 29 and the flag of the organisation hoisted over the building.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} A council was elected to prepare the way for parliamentary government.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1958 a [[democracy|democratic]] election was held giving opportunity to all members in the countries where they resided to elect deputies to the first parliament which met in [[Vienna]] in May 1959.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Up to this time the organisation had used the title, "Commonwealth of World Citizens" which was abandoned in favour of "The Mondcivitan Republic". Hugh Schonfield, the pioneer of the enterprise, was elected acting president and the organisation chose an executive committee headed by a young member, Donald Hanby  who was referred to as the ''prime minister''.

In 1963, the organisation held its second ''parliament''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The term of this body was to be for five years. In accordance with the constitution, a presidium of five was elected under the name of the Supreme Council, each member of which would hold the office of president for one year in turn.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Those elected, in the order of their presidency, were Frieda Bacon, Justo Priesto, Nguyen-Huu, [[Anthony Brooke]] and Hugh J. Schonfield, the last named to take office at the end of August 1967. The post of ''prime minister'' was relinquished and replaced under the constitution with that of ''commissioner-general'' and Donald Hanby was elected to that office.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

At this time, the [[International Arbitration League]], founded at the beginning of the 20th century by the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner, Sir [[William Randal Cremer]], decided that its work could best be continued by the ''Mondcivitan Republic'' and the two organisations fused.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The work of the World Service Trust continued and a housing agency, the Cremer Housing Association, was formed, which later provided new premises for use by the organisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1971, the provisional constitution was suspended to make way for formulating a full constitution.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} To enable the organisation to ensure the best means of governance, an executive council was appointed to take full responsibility for the organisation's affairs in the interim period.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It was hoped that a full constitution and self-government could be achieved by 1975, but this did not happen.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Projects==
In 1972 Hugh Schonfield's book about the fundamental ideas behind the organisation, The ''Politics of God,'' was published and received much interest, particularly because it had been preceded by the best-selling [[The Passover Plot]], which had created much discussion and aroused interest in the concept of [[Messianism]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The Community school project was started as an experiment by the organisation's membership.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It was intended to provide a viable alternative to the prevalent educational concepts, with primary aim to give each child freedom, experience, resources and love.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} It was believed that this should take place in, and be directly concerned with, the community as a whole, encouraging children to take an active interest in serving and changing the community for the betterment of the whole of mankind.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Various methods of achieving these aims were implemented.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The school was supported by donations from members and charged no fees.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Many of the children were "problem" children from the neighbourhood of the school who went on to lead productive lives.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==The World Service Trust==
The World Service Trust was founded in 1955 as a special agency of the organisation for the purpose of giving impartial aid to people and countries in circumstances of poverty, famine, disease and epidemics, as well as natural disasters.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The secondary organisation was also designed to assist education and improve standards of living.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 1990 the secondary organisation became a foundation and was renamed "The Hugh and Helene Schonfield World Service Trust".{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The Schonfields contributed to it financially. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The organisation fell into decline following the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Its archives are now deposited with the [[Bishopsgate Institute]] in London.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}
Its activities became more centred in Germany as the community initiated by [[Wilhelm Haller]] felt a more decentralised and less bureaucratic approach was necessary. A new initiative was started in 2004 with the founding of the 'International Leadership and Business Society', intended to encourage the application of the original Mondcivitan principles in business and everyday life. The Hugh &amp; Helene Schonfield World Service Trust continued to work particularly with its responsibility for the archiving and publicising of the work of the late Hugh J. Schonfield and research into the concepts of Messianism, [[Humanitism]] and ''Servant-Nationhood'' and methods to find their practical realisation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In 2014 a revival of the movement was started in an attempt to find a current interpretation. This has led to the establishment of a Facebook page. {{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

[[Image:Berkeley Square evening December 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|Communal gardens in the centre of [[Berkeley Square]], [[Mayfair]], [[London]]]]
A '''communal garden''' (often used in the plural as '''communal gardens''') is a (normally formal) [[garden]] for shared use by a number of local residents, typically in an urban setting. The term is especially used in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Business/Environment/Communalgardens/ Communal gardens], [[Glasgow]], UK {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712062559/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Business/Environment/Communalgardens/ |date=July 12, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre of many city squares and crescents (especially in [[London]], for example) are maintained as communal gardens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensquares.org/detail/index.html?../detail/ArundelElgin.html Arundel &amp; Elgin Communal Gardens]{{dead link|date= August 2017 |bot= InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted= yes }}, London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, and the fact that they typically look like small [[public park]]s, such gardens are normally privately or jointly owned, with sharing of maintenance costs. Access may be restricted by locked gates, with keys available for residents, or only unlocked during daytime. They are often surrounded by tall railings designed{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to keep people out.

One of the scenes in the 1999 film [[Notting Hill (film)| ''Notting Hill'']] involves the two main characters, Anna ([[Julia Roberts]]) and William ([[Hugh Grant]]), breaking into private and locked communal gardens by climbing over the wall at night after a dinner party. The communal gardens used were [[Rosmead Gardens]] in Rosmead Road, [[Notting Hill]], London.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Conceptual history''' (also the '''history of concepts''' or, from German, '''''Begriffsgeschichte''''') is a branch of historical and cultural studies that deals with the historical [[semantics]] of terms. It sees the [[etymology]] and the change in meaning of terms as forming a crucial basis for contemporary cultural, conceptual and linguistic understanding. Conceptual history deals with the evolution of paradigmatic ideas and value systems over time, such as "liberty" or "reform." It argues that [[social history]] – indeed all historical reflection – must begin with an understanding of historically contingent cultural values and practices in their particular contexts over time, not merely as unchanging ideologies or processes.

Interest in conceptual history was given a particular boost in the 20th century through the publication of the ''Historisches Wörterbuch der Philosophie'', the ''Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe'' and the journal [[Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte]].

Conceptual history is an [[interdisciplinary]] methodology. Alongside the [[philosopher]] [[Joachim Ritter]], the [[historian]]s [[Otto Brunner]] and  [[Reinhart Koselleck]] and the [[sociologist]] [[Erich Rothacker]] are viewed as the leading scholars of the research area in the German-speaking world and internationally. [[Raymond Williams]] is the leading scholar in the English-speaking world. Examples of conceptual histories include a genealogy of the concept of globalization drawing on the approach of Williams written by Manfred B. Steger and Paul James:

{{cquote|Although keywords represent a critical mass of the vocabulary of any given era, the history of their meaning construction often remains obscure. ‘Globalization’ is no exception. While the meanings of other seminal ‘keywords’ such as ‘economics’, ‘culture’, or ‘modernity’ evolved rather slowly and built upon a relatively continuous base, ‘globalization’ has had a very short and discontinuous history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2014 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | last2= Steger | first2= Manfred B. | title= A Genealogy of Globalization: The Career of a Concept | url= http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rglo20/11/4#.VR0vDzuUdPM | journal= Globalizations | volume=  11 | issue=  4 | pages= 418–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Naming==
The space observatory is nicknamed '''Wukong''' ({{zh|悟空}}) after the [[Monkey King]], who is the hero in the classic Chinese tale ''[[Journey to the West]]''.
Literally, "wu"(悟) means comprehension or understanding and "kong"（空）means void, so this name could also be understood as "understanding the void", relating to the undiscovered nature of dark matter.&lt;ref name="Wukong" /&gt;

The English name, DAMPE, was a [[backronym]], which was named after a NPC in ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'', '''Dampé''' ({{jp|ダンペイ}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://m.265g.com/pc/news/1712/18792.html | title=悟空卫星英文名DAMPE竟源自《塞尔达传说》}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, player need Dampé to find the treasure, which match with the mission of DAMPE (not finding dark matter, but finding the evidence that dark matter exist).

In developmental [[biology]] and [[zoology]], '''defeminization''' is an aspect of the process of [[sexual differentiation]] by which a potential female-specific structure, function, or behavior is changed by one of the processes of male development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/defeminization|title=Defeminization definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term might seem to imply "removal" of female characteristics, in nearly all biological contexts it refers to ''prevention'' of an aspect of female development from manifesting.

In human [[biology of gender]], the best known example of this is the prevention of development of the [[müllerian duct]] derivatives by [[anti-müllerian hormone]] (AMH) in the 3rd and 4th months of [[fetus|fetal]] development, though the term is not commonly used in discussions of human development.

In a number of non-human [[mammal]]s, there is evidence that hormones produced by the testes act directly on the [[brain]] to prevent development of female characteristics, especially female [[Animal sexual behavior|reproductive behavior]].

'''''Divine Action and Modern Science''''' (2002) is a book written by Nicholas Saunders. It looks at [[Near East]]ern biblical and modern theological approaches to the idea of [[Divine Providence|divine action]], covering such questions as how divine action occurs, what its effects are, the relationship between divine and finite causation and complementarity versus [[mutually exclusive|mutual exclusivity]]. Saunders concludes that God is active in the physical world, but not as described by traditional accounts.&lt;ref&gt;David Atkinson, Words and works, ''[[Times Literary Supplement]],'' January 9, 2004 issue 5258 p27(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this book, Saunders differentiates between general and special divine action, with the former referring to the actions of God concerning the entirety of the natural order (initial creation and continual sustenance), and the latter pointing to the actions of God with regards to a particular time and place (such as a particular divine intervention or responses to prayer).

The author’s categorical disagreement with current endeavors to bring together special divine action (SDA) with quantum assumptions and chaos theory is reflected in the book, saying that people are still remotely far from a reasonable hypothesis of divine action in a world that is consonant with contemporary science. Nonetheless, Saunders presumes that God exists and is currently active in the world in a specific sense setting off new fundamental interactions in nature. The book’s writer further concedes that while people cannot ever seek to have inclusive comprehension of God’s action within the world, this should not be a reason for anyone to go to the opposite extreme and assert that God’s transcendence prohibits any evocative discussions of His actions.

== Key points ==
Essentially, ''Divine Action and Modern Science'' attempted to reconcile God and his actions with science. The book's main thesis is that Divine action should be considered an action upon and within nature. This being said, it is part of nature and, therefore, "the mechanics of describing such action, in some way, correlate with the mechanics of describing nature herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epperson|first=Michael|date=October 2004|title=Book Review: Nicholas. Saunders,&amp;nbsp; Divine Action and Modern Science.|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/426996?journalCode=jr|journal=The Journal of Religion|language=en|volume=84|issue=4|pages=648–649|doi=10.1086/426996|issn=0022-4189|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saunders also drew from several theories on Divine Action such as those put forward by thinkers William Pollard, [[Nancey Murphy]], and [[Thomas M. Tracy|Thomas Tracy]], among others. In his discourse, the author – through the evidence provided by these scholars – concluded that for each Divine action, there is a scientific feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wesleywildman.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/docs/2003-Wildman-Review-of-Saunders-Divine-Action-and-Modern-Science.pdf|title=Divine Action and Modern Science|last=Wildman|first=Wesley|date=2002|website=Wesley Wildman|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the book claimed that a scientific explanation of the Divine action could revolutionize theological traditions, making it more relevant and tenable in light of our modern understanding of the natural sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Divine Action and Modern Science|last=Saunders|first=Nicholas|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521801567|location=Cambridge|pages=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecological design''' is defined by [[Sim Van der Ryn]] and Stuart Cowan as "any form of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with living processes."&lt;ref&gt;Van der Ryn S, Cowan S(1996). “Ecological Design”. Island Press, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological design is an integrative ecologically responsible design discipline. 

It helps connect scattered efforts in [[green architecture]], [[sustainable agriculture]], [[ecological engineering]], [[ecological restoration]] and other fields. The “eco” prefix was used to ninety sciences including [[eco-city]], eco-management, eco-technique, eco-tecture. It was first used by John Button in 1998. The inchoate developing nature of ecological design was referred to the “adding in “of environmental factor to the design process, but later it was focused on the details of eco-design practice such as product system or individual product or industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This reference cannot be found. Replace with something more accessible.  --&gt;Anne-Marie Willis (1991), “An international Eco Design” conference&lt;/ref&gt;
By including life cycle models through energy and materials flow, ecological design was related to the new [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] subject of [[industrial ecology]]. Industrial ecology meant a conceptual tool emulating models derived from natural ecosystem and a frame work for conceptualizing environmental and technical issues.

Living organisms exist in various systems of balanced symbiotic relationships. The ecological movement of the late twentieth-century is based on understanding that disruptions in these relationships has led to serious breakdown of natural [[ecosystems]]. In human history, technological means have resulted in growth of human populations through fire, implements and weapons. This dramatic increase in explosive population contributed the introduction of mechanical energies in machine production and there have been improvements in mechanized agriculture, manufactured chemical fertilizers and general health measures. Although the earlier invention inclined energy adjusting the ecological balance, population growth following the industrial revolution led to abnormal ecological change.&lt;ref&gt;John McHale (1969), “An Ecological Overview”, in The Future of the Future, New York; George Braziller, pp.66-74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological design issues and the role of designers==
Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], many propositions in the design field were raised with unsustainable design principles. The architect-designer [[Victor Papanek]] suggested that [[industrial design]] has murdered by creating new species of permanent garbage and by choosing materials and processes that pollute the air.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Papanek (1972), “Design for the Real World: Human Ecological and social change”, Chicago: Academy Edition, ix.&lt;/ref&gt; For these issues, [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], who was invited as University Professor at [[Southern Illinois University]] in Carbondale in 1960s, demonstrated how design could play a central role in identifying major world problems between 1965 and 1975. That included following contents:&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Margolin]] (1997), “Design for a Sustainable World”, Design Issues, vol14, 2. pp. 85&lt;/ref&gt;
*Review and analysis of world [[energy resources]]
*Defining more efficient uses of natural resources such as metals
*Integrating machine tools into efficient systems of industrial production
In the 1992 conference, ‘The Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet”, a proposition was put forward that our world is on a path of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption|consumption]] that cannot be sustained. The report drew attention to Individuals and groups around the world who have a set of principles to develop strategies for change that might be effective in world economics and trade policies, and the design professions will play a role in it. Namely, those meant that design profession becomes not what new products to make, but how to reinvent design culture likely to be realized. He noted designers firstly have to realize that design has historically been a dependent, contingent practice rather than one based on necessity. The design theorist, Clive Dilnot noted design becomes once again a means of ordering the world rather than merely of shaping products.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Dilnot (1982), “Design as a Society Significant Activity: An Introduction”, Design studies 3:2. pp.144&lt;/ref&gt; As a broader approach, the conference of ‘Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet’ 1992, emphasized that designers should challenge for facing human problems. These problems were mentioned to six themes: quality of life, efficient use of natural resources, protecting the global commons, managing human settlements, the use of chemicals and the management of human industrial waste, and fostering [[sustainable economic growth]] on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Margolin (1988), “Design for a Sustainable World”, Design Issues, vol14,2. pp. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
*1971 [[Ian McHarg]], in his book "Design with Nature", popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. McHarg gave every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc.  This system became the foundation of today's [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), a ubiquitous tool used in the practice of ecological landscape design.
*1978 [[Permaculture]].  Bill Mollison and David Holmgren coin the phrase for a system of designing regenerative human ecosystems.  (Founded in the work of Fukuoka, Yeoman, Smith, etc..
*1994  [[David Orr]], in his book "Earth in Mind: On Education, Environment, and the Human Prospect", compiled a series of essays on "ecolgocial design intelligence" and its power to create healthy, durable, resilient, just, and prosperous communities.
*1994  Canadian biologists [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]] and Nancy Jack Todd, in their book "From Eco-Cities to Living Machines" describe the precepts of ecological design.
*2000 [[Ecosa Institute]] begins offering an [http://ecosa.org/ecological-design-certificate-program/ Ecological Design Certificate], teaching designers to design with nature.
*2004 [[Fritjof Capra]], in his book "The Hidden Connections: A Science for Sustainable Living", wrote this primer on the science of [[living systems]] and considers the application of new thinking by life scientists to our understanding of social organization.
*2004 K. Ausebel compiled compelling personal stories of the world's most innovative ecological designers in "Nature's Operating Instructions."

There are some clothing companies that are using several ecological design methods to change the future of the textile industry into a more environmentally friendly one. Recycling used clothing to minimize the use of resources, using [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] textile materials to reduce the impact on the environment, and using plant dyes instead of poisonous chemicals to improve the appearance of fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Taieb, Amine Hadj et al.

'''Elder abuse''' (also called "'''elder mistreatment'''", "'''senior abuse'''", "'''abuse in later life'''", "'''abuse of older adults'''", "'''abuse of older women'''", and "'''abuse of older men'''") is "a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elderabuse.org.uk elderabuse.org.uk], accessed October 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been adopted by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) from a definition put forward by Action on Elder Abuse in the UK. Laws protecting the elderly from abuse are similar to and related to, laws protecting [[dependent adult]]s from abuse.

It includes harms by people the older person knows, or has a relationship with, such as a spouse, partner, or family member; a friend or neighbor; or people that the older person relies on for services. Many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of [[domestic violence]] or family violence since they are committed by family members. Paid caregivers have also been known to prey on their elderly patients.

While a variety of circumstances are considered elder abuse, it does not include general criminal activity against older persons, such as home break-ins, "muggings" in the street, or "distraction burglary", where a stranger distracts an older person at the doorstep while another person enters the property to steal.

The abuse of elders by caregivers is a worldwide issue. In 2002, WHO brought international attention to the issue of elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Daniels, L., (2003b, January/February). "2003 is the year elder abuse hits the international state." Victimization of the Elderly and Disabled. 5, 65-66, 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, government agencies and community professional groups, worldwide, have specified elder abuse as a social problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rinkler A.G. | year = 2009 | title = Recognition and perception of elder abuse by prehospital and hospital-based care providers | url = | journal = Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 110–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the International Network for Prevention of Elder Abuse (INPEA) designated June 15 as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEAAD), and an increasing number of events are held across the globe on this day to raise awareness of elder abuse and highlight ways to challenge such abuse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inpea.net/ International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse], accessed June 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although elders who have dementia or mental illness commonly make false accusations of theft and other forms of abuse by caregivers or family members, all reports of abuse must be investigated.

==Types==

Although there are common themes of elder abuse across nations, there are also unique manifestations based upon history, culture, economic strength, and societal perceptions of older people within nations themselves. The fundamental common denominator is the use of power and control by one individual to affect the well-being and status of another, older, individual.

There are several types of [[abuse]] of older people that are generally recognized as being elder abuse, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson, De Benedictis, Segal|title=Elder Abuse and Neglect|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|publisher=Help Guide|accessdate=15 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211154305/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Elder Abuse?|url=http://www.aoa.gov/AoA_programs/Elder_Rights/EA_Prevention/whatIsEA.aspx|publisher=Administration on Aging|accessdate=17 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220071251/http://www.aoa.gov/AoA_programs/Elder_Rights/EA_Prevention/whatIsEA.aspx|archivedate=20 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Physical abuse|Physical]]''': e.g. hitting, punching, slapping, burning, pushing, kicking, restraining, false imprisonment/confinement, or giving excessive or improper medication as well as withholding treatment and medication.
*'''[[Psychological abuse|Psychological/Emotional]]''': e.g. [[humiliating]] a person. A common theme is a perpetrator who identifies something that matters to an older person and then uses it to coerce an older person into a particular action. It may take verbal forms such as yelling,  name-calling, [[ridiculing]], [[hypercriticism|constantly criticizing]], accusations, [[blaming]], or nonverbal forms such as ignoring, silence, shunning or withdrawing affection.
* '''[[Elder financial abuse]]''': also known as financial exploitation, involving misappropriation of financial resources by family members, caregivers, or strangers, or the use of financial means to control the person or facilitate other types of abuse.
* '''[[Sexual abuse|Sexual]]''': e.g. forcing a person to take part in any sexual activity without his or her consent, including forcing them to participate in conversations of a sexual nature against their will; may also include situations where person is no longer able to give consent ([[dementia]]).
* '''[[Neglect]]''': e.g. depriving a person of proper medical treatment, food, heat, clothing or comfort or essential medication and depriving a person of needed services to force certain kinds of actions, financial and otherwise. Neglect can include leaving an at-risk (i.e. fall risk) elder person unattended. The deprivation may be intentional (active neglect) or happen out of lack of knowledge or resources (passive neglect).
 
In addition, some U.S. state laws&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nursinghomeabuselaws.org/elders/ Nursing Home Abuse Laws (NHAL)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310015901/http://www.nursinghomeabuselaws.org/elders/ |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also recognize the following as elder abuse:
* '''[[Abandonment (legal)#Failure to fulfill a responsibility|Abandonment]]''': deserting a dependent person with the intent to abandon them or leave them unattended at a place for such a time period as may be likely to endanger their health or welfare.&lt;ref name="Oregon Revised Statutes"&gt;Oregon Revised Statutes.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rights abuse''': denying the civil and constitutional rights of a person who is old, but not declared by court to be mentally incapacitated. This is an aspect of elder abuse that is increasingly being recognized and adopted by nations.
* '''[[Self-neglect]]''': any persons neglecting themselves by not caring about their own health, well-being or safety. Self-neglect (harm by self) is treated as conceptually different than abuse (harm by others). Elder self-neglect can lead to illness, injury, or even death. Common needs that older adults may deny themselves, or ignore are the following: Sustenance (food or water); cleanliness (bathing and personal hygiene); adequate clothing for climate protection; proper shelter; adequate safety; clean and healthy surroundings; medical attention for serious illness; essential medications.&lt;ref&gt;Tina de Benedictis, Ph.D., Jaelline Jaffe, Ph.D., and Jeanne Segal, Ph.D., (2007) Elder Abuse Types, Signs, Symptoms, Causes, and Help. Helpguide, helpguide.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Self-neglect is often created by an individual's declining mental awareness or capability. Some older adults may choose to deny themselves some health or safety benefits, which may not be self-neglect. This may simply be their personal choice. Caregivers and other responsible individuals must honor these choices if the older adult is sound of mind. In other instances, the older adult may lack the needed resources, as a result of poverty, or other social condition. This is also not considered as "self-neglect".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Christopher, JD. [http://www.christopherbjohnson.com/2015/02/19/elder-abuse-neglect-self-abuse/ "Elder Abuse: Neglect and Self Abuse"], California, 19 February 2015. Retrieved on 25 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Institutional abuse]]''' refers to physical or psychological harms, as well as rights violations in settings where care and assistance is provided to dependent older adults or others, such as nursing homes. Recent studies of approximately 2,000 nursing home facility residents in the United States reported a growing abuse rate of 44% and neglect up to 95%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nursinghomeabusecenter.com/elder-abuse/statistics/|title=Elder Abuse Statistics - Statistics on Elderly Abuse Over Time|work=Nursing Home Abuse Center|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; making elder abuse in nursing homes a growing danger. Exact statistics are rare due to elder abuse in general and specifically in nursing homes being a silent condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nursinghomeabuseguide.org/nursing-home-abuse-statistics/|title=Nursing Home Abuse Statistics - Elderly Care|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.caregiver.org/selected-long-term-care-statistics|title=Selected Long-Term Care Statistics {{!}} Family Caregiver Alliance|website=www.caregiver.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warning signs==

The key to prevention and intervention of elder abuse is the ability to recognize the warning signs of its occurrence. Signs of elder abuse differ depending on the type of abuse the victim is suffering. Each type of abuse has distinct signs associated with it.
* '''Physical abuse''' can be detected by visible signs on the body, including bruises, scars, sprains, or broken bones. More subtle indications of physical abuse include signs of restraint, such as rope marks on the  wrist, or broken eyeglasses.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Lawrence|title=Elder abuse and neglect: Warning signs, risk factors, prevention, and help|url=http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|accessdate=16 December 2012|author2=Tina De Benedictis|author3=Jeanne Segal|date=November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211154305/http://www.helpguide.org/mental/elder_abuse_physical_emotional_sexual_neglect.htm|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Emotional abuse''' often accompanies the other types of abuse and can usually be detected by changes in the personality or behavior. The elder may also exhibit behavior mimicking dementia, such as rocking or mumbling.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; Emotional abuse is the most underreported abuse of elder abuse. Elder abuse occurs when a person fails to treat an elder with respect and includes verbal abuse, the elder experiences social isolation, or lack of acknowledgement. Some indicators of the emotional effects of elder abuse is the elder adult being unresponsive or uncommunicative. Also they can be unreasonably suspicious or fearful, more isolated, and not wanting to be as social as they may have been before. Emotional abuse is under reported, but can have the most damaging effects because it leads to more physical and mental health problems.
* '''Financial exploitation''' is a more subtle form of abuse, in comparison to other types, and may be more challenging to notice. Signs of financial exploitation include significant withdrawals from accounts, belongings or money missing from the home, unpaid bills, and unnecessary goods or services.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; 
* '''Sexual abuse,''' like physical abuse, can be detected by visible signs on the body, especially around the breasts or genital area. Other signs include inexplicable infections, bleeding, and torn underclothing.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt; 
* '''Neglect''' is a type of abuse in that it can be inflicted either by the caregiver or oneself. Signs of neglect include malnutrition and dehydration, poor hygiene, noncompliance to a prescription medication, and unsafe living conditions.&lt;ref name="Robinson" /&gt;

In addition to observing signs in the elderly individual,  abuse can also be detected by monitoring changes in the caregiver's behavior. For example, the caregiver may not allow them to speak to or receive visitors, exhibit indifference or a lack of affection towards the elder, or refer to the elder as "a burden." Caregivers who have a history of substance abuse or mental illness are more likely to commit elder abuse than other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Signs and symptoms of elder abuse and neglect in care|url=http://www.advocare.org.au/help-with-aged-care-complaints/signs-and-symptoms-of-eld/|publisher=Advocare Incorporated|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abuse can sometimes be subtle, and therefore difficult, to detect. Regardless, awareness organizations and research advise to take any suspicion seriously and to address concerns adequately and immediately.

=== Signs of elder abuse ===

* Broken bones or fractures
* Poor physical appearance
* Changes in mental status
* Frequent infections
* Bruising, welts or cuts
* Unexplained weight loss
* Refusal to speak
* Signs of dehydration
* Lack of cleanliness

==Health consequences==

The health consequences of elder abuse are serious. Elder abuse can destroy an elderly person's quality of life in the forms of:&lt;ref name="Dong"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dong X | year = 2005 | title = Medical Implications of Elder Abuse and Neglect | url = | journal = Clinics in Geriatric Medicine | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 293–313 | doi=10.1016/j.cger.2004.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Declining functional abilities
* Increased dependency, sense of helplessness and stress
* Worsening psychological decline
* Premature mortality and morbidity
* Depression and dementia
* Malnutrition
* Bed sores
* Death

The risk of death for elder abuse victims are three times higher than for non-victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = American Medical Association White Paper on Elderly Health | year = 1990 | title = report on the Council on Scientific Affairs | url = | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 150 | issue = | pages = 2459–72 | doi=10.1001/archinte.1990.00390230019004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common abusers==

An abuser can be a spouse, partner, relative, a friend or neighbor, a volunteer worker, a paid worker, practitioner, solicitor, or any other individual with the intent to deprive a vulnerable person of their resources. Relatives include adult children and their spouses or partners, their offspring and other extended family members. Children and living relatives who have a history of substance abuse or have had other life troubles are of particular concern. For example, [[Elder financial abuse#Hybrid financial exploitation|Hybrid Financial Exploitation (HFE)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-04350-001|title=Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons|last=Jackson|first=Shelly L.|authorlink=|last2=Hafemeister|first2=Thomas L.|date=|website=|publisher="Psychology of Violence"|orig-year=|publication-date=2012|access-date=August 15, 2018}}{{dead link|date=September 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; abusive individuals are more likely to be a relative, chronically unemployed, and dependent on the elderly person.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jackson S, Hafemeister T | year = 2012 | title = Pure financial exploitation vs. Hybrid financial exploitation co-occurring with physical abuse and/or neglect of elderly persons | url = | journal = Psychology Of Violence | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 285–296 | doi=10.1037/a0027273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, past studies have estimated that between 16% and 38% of all elder abusers have a history of mental illness. Elder abuse perpetrated by individuals with mental illnesses can be decreased by lessening the level of dependency that persons with serious mental illness have on family members. This can be done by funneling more resourced into housing assistance programs, intensive care management services, and better welfare benefits for individuals with serious mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Labrum T, Solomon PL. Physical elder abuse perpetrated by relatives with serious mental illness: A preliminary conceptual social–ecological model. Aggression and Violent Behavior, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; People with substance abuse and mental health disorders typically have very small social networks, and this confinement contributes to the overall occurrence of elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Labrum T, Solomon PL. Elder mistreatment perpetrators with substance abuse and/or mental health conditions: Results from the National Elder Mistreatment Study. Psychiatric Quarterly, 2017 May 23. doi: 10.1007/s11126-017-9513-z. [Epub ahead of print]&lt;/ref&gt;

Perpetrators of elder abuse can include anyone in a [[position of trust]], control or authority over the individual. Family relationships, neighbors and friends, are all socially considered as relationships of trust, whether or not the older adult actually thinks of the people as "trustworthy". Some perpetrators may "groom" an older person (befriend or build a relationship with them) in order to establish a relationship of trust. Older people living alone who have no adult children living nearby are particularly vulnerable to "grooming" by neighbors and friends who would hope to gain control of their estates.

The majority of abusers are relatives, typically the older adult's spouse/partner or sons and daughters, although the type of abuse differs according to the relationship. In some situations the abuse is "domestic violence grown old", a situation in which the abusive behavior of a spouse or partner continues into old age. In some situations, an older couple may be attempting to care and support each other and failing, in the absence of external support. With sons and daughters it tends to be financial abuse, justified by a belief that it is nothing more than the "advance inheritance" of property, valuables and money.

Within paid care environments, abuse can occur for a variety of reasons. Some abuse is the willful act of cruelty inflicted by a single individual upon an older person. In fact, a case study in Canada suggests that the high elder abuse statistics are from repeat offenders who, like in other forms of abuse, practice elder abuse for the [[schadenfreude]] associated with the act. More commonly, institutional abuses or neglect may reflect lack of knowledge, lack of training, lack of support, or insufficient resourcing. Institutional abuse may be the consequence of common practices or processes that are part of the running of a care institution or service. Sometimes this type of abuse is referred to as "poor practice", although this term reflects the motive of the perpetrator (the causation) rather than the impact upon the older person.

With the aging of today's population, there is the potential that elder abuse will increase unless it is more comprehensively recognized and addressed.

Elder abuse is not a direct parallel to child maltreatment, as perpetrators of elder abuse do not have the same legal protection of rights as parents of children do. For example, a court order is needed to remove a child from their home but not to remove a victim of elder abuse from theirs.&lt;ref&gt;Beach SR, Carpenter CR, Rosen T, Sharps P, Gelles R. Screening and detection of elder abuse: Research opportunities and lessons learned from emergency geriatric care, intimate partner violence, and child abuse. Journal of Elder Abuse and Neglect. 2016; 28(4-5): 185-216. 10.1080/08946566.2016.1229241&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors for elder abuse==

Various [[risk factors]] increase the likelihood that an elderly person will become a victim of elder abuse, including an elderly person who:&lt;ref name=" Hildreth"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hildreth C.J. | year = 2011 | title = Elder Abuse | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 306 | issue = 5| page = 568 | doi =  10.1001/jama.306.5.568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Has memory problems (such as dementia)
* Has a mental illness, either long-standing or recent
* Has physical disabilities
* Has depression, loneliness, or lack of social support
* Abuses alcohol or other substances
* Takes prescribed medications that impair judgment
* Is verbally or physically combative with the caregiver
* Has a shared living situation

Several other risk factors increase the likelihood that a caregiver will participate in elder abuse, including a caregiver who:&lt;ref name="Hildreth" /&gt;
* Feels overwhelmed or resentful
* Has a history of substance abuse or a history of abusing others
* Is dependent on the older person for housing, finances, or other needs
* Has mental health problems
* Is unemployed
* Has a criminal history
* Has a shared living situation

In addition:
* Lower income or poverty has been found to be associated with elder abuse. Low economic resources have been conceptualized as a contextual or situational stressor contributing to elder abuse.
* Living with a large number of household members other than a spouse is associated with an increased risk of abuse, especially financial abuse.

Risk factors can also be categorized into individual, relationship, community, and sociocultural levels. At the individual level, elders who have poor physical and mental health are at higher risk. At the relationship level, a shared living situation is a huge risk factor for the elderly, and living in the same area as the abuser is more likely to result in abuse. At the community level, caregivers may knowingly or inadvertently cause social isolation of the elderly. At the sociocultural level, a representation of an older person as weak and dependent, lack of funds to pay for care, elderly people who need assistance but live alone, and destruction of bonds between the generation of a family are possible factors in elder abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs357/en/|title=Elder abuse|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and statistics==

There has been a general lack of reliable data in this area and it is often argued that the absence of data is a reflection of the low priority given to work associated with older people. However, over the past decade there has been a growing amount of research into the nature and extent of elder abuse. The research still varies considerably in the definitions being used, who is being asked, and what is being asked. As a result, the statistics used in this area vary considerably.

One study suggests that around 25% of vulnerable older adults will report abuse in the previous month, totaling up to 6% of the general elderly population.&lt;ref name="pmid18349012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cooper C, Selwood A, Livingston G |title=The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect: a systematic review |journal=Age Ageing |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=151–60 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18349012 |doi=10.1093/ageing/afm194 |url=http://ageing.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=18349012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some consistent themes are beginning to emerge from interaction with abused elders, and through limited and small scale research projects. Work undertaken in Canada suggests that approximately 70% of elder abuse is perpetrated against women and this is supported by evidence from the AEA helpline in the UK, which identifies women as victims in 67% of calls. Also domestic violence in later life may be a continuation of long term partner abuse and in some cases, abuse may begin with retirement or the onset of a health condition.&lt;ref&gt;Silent and Invisible: A Report on Abuse and Violence in the Lives of Older Women in British Columbia and Yukon, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, abuse increases with age, with 78% of victims being over 70 years of age.&lt;ref name="HiddenVoices"&gt;Hidden Voices, Action on Elder Abuse, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The higher proportion of spousal homicides supports the suggestion that abuse of older women is often a continuation of long term spousal abuse against women. In contrast, the risk of homicide for older men was far greater outside the family than within.&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Canada, 1999, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important point because the domestic violence of older people is often not recognized and consequently strategies, which have proved effective within the domestic violence arena, have not been routinely transferred into circumstances involving the family abuse of older people.

According to the AEA helpline in the UK, abuse occurs primarily in the family home (64%), followed by residential care (23%), and then hospitals (5%), although a helpline does not necessarily provide a true reflection of such situations as it is based upon the physical and mental ability of people to utilize such a resource.&lt;ref name="HiddenVoices" /&gt;

Research conducted in [[New Zealand]] broadly supports the above findings, with some variations. Of 1288 cases in 2002–2004, 1201 individuals, 42 couples, and 45 groups were found to have been abused. Of these, 70 percent were female. Psychological abuse (59%), followed by material/financial (42%), and physical abuse (12%) were the most frequently identified types of abuse. Sexual abuse occurred in 2% of reported cases.&lt;ref name="ACNZ" /&gt;
Age Concern New Zealand found that most abusers are family members (70%), most commonly sons or daughters (40%). Older abusers (those over 65 years) are more likely to be husbands.&lt;ref name="ACNZ"&gt;Age Concern Elder Abuse and Neglect Prevention Services: An Analysis of Referrals for the period 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2004. Age Concern New Zealand, November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, 4,766 cases of suspected abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation involving older adults were reported, an increase of 9 percent over 2006. 19 incidents were related to a death, and a total of 303 incidents were considered life-threatening. About one in 11 incidents involved a life-threatening or fatal situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Types of Nursing Home Abuse|url=http://bruceflint.com/types-and-symping-home-abuse/|accessdate=13 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916212825/http://bruceflint.com/types-and-symping-home-abuse/|archive-date=16 September 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the study called Pure Financial Exploitation vs. Hybrid Exploitation Co-Occurring With Physical Abuse and/or Neglect of Elderly Persons by Shelly L. Jackson and Thomas L. Hafemeister brought attention to the hybrid abuse that elderly persons can experience. This study revealed that victims of hybrid financial exploitation or HFE lost an average of $185,574, a range of $20–$750,000.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Barriers to obtaining statistics===

Several conditions make it hard for researchers to obtain accurate statistics on elder abuse. Researchers may have difficulty obtaining accurate elder abuse statistics for the following reasons:

* Elder abuse is largely a hidden problem and tends to be committed in the privacy of the elderly person's home, mostly by his or her family members.&lt;ref&gt;Administration on Aging. (1998). The national elder abuse incidence study: Final report. [Online], Available:www.aoa.gov/abuse/report/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Elder abuse victims are often unwilling to report their abuse for fear of others' disbelief, fear of loss of independence, fear of being institutionalized, fear of losing their only social support (especially if the perpetrator is a relative), and fear of being subject to future retaliation by the perpetrator(s).&lt;ref&gt;Acierno, R., Hernandex-Tejada, M., Muzzy, W., and Steve, K. (2009). The national elder mistreatment study (NCJ Publication No. 2264560.

* Another reason why there is a lack of accurate statistics is the debate of whether to include self-neglect or not.

Due to this discrepancy and the others mentioned above, it is difficult to get accurate data concerning the abuse of the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;Brownell, P., &amp; Rosich, G. (2007). Elder abuse. In J.

==Prevention==
[[File:Measures Used to Help Protect Older Adults with Guardians from Abuse (31560997996) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=2|Graphic depicting protective measures taken to prevent elder abuse, from the [[Government Accountability Office]]]]
Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel can play a vital role in assisting elder abuse victims. Studies have shown that elderly individuals, on average, make 13.9 visits per year to a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics. Older Americans 2008: Key indicators of well-being. Federal Interagency Forum on Aging-Related Statistics, Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there has been an increase in awareness of elder abuse over the years, physicians tend to only report 2% of elder abuse cases.&lt;ref name="Dong"/&gt; Reasons for lack of reporting by physicians include a lack of current knowledge concerning state laws on elder abuse, concern about angering the abuser and ruining the relationship with the elderly patient, possible court appearances, lack of cooperation from elderly patients or families, and lack of time and reimbursement.&lt;ref name="Dong"/&gt; Through education and training on elder abuse, health care professionals can better assist elder abuse victims.

Educating and training those in the criminal justice system, such as police, prosecutors, and the judiciary, on elder abuse, as well as increased legislation to protect elders, will also help to minimize elder abuse and will also provide improved assistance to victims of elder abuse.

In addition, community involvement in responding to elder abuse can contribute to elderly persons' safety. In general, preventing the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse helps not only the elder but it may also improve the anxiety and depression of their caregivers too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=PR|last2=Francis|first2=DP|last3=Hairi|first3=NN|last4=Othman|first4=S|last5=Choo|first5=WY|title=Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=16 August 2016|issue=8|pages=CD010321|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010321.pub2|pmid=27528431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities can develop programs that are structured around meeting the needs of elderly persons. For example, several communities throughout the United States have created Financial Abuse Specialist Teams,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coaoc.org/html/services_fast_description.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  which are multidisciplinary groups that consist of public and private professionals who volunteer their time to advise Adult Protective Services (APS), law enforcement, and private attorneys on matters of vulnerable adult financial abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Council on Aging Orange County, http://www.coaoc.org/html/services_fast_description.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==False accusations of elder abuse==

It is important to recognize that false accusations of elder abuse are very common. An elderly person who has dementia or a mental illness may falsely claim to be a victim of abuse. By one estimate, 70% of elderly people with mental impairments such as dementia, delusions, or paranoia falsely accuse caregivers of stealing. Mentally impaired elders may claim that a caregiver is feeding them poisoned food or holding them prisoner. Websites such as Alzlive.com and DailyCaring.com offer advice for caregivers who are falsely accused of elder abuse or other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alzlive.com/tips/caregiving/false-accusations-theft/|title=False Accusations--Theft}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaring.com/8-ways-to-deal-with-false-dementia-accusations/|title=8 Ways to Deal with False Dementia Accusations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailycaring.com/responding-to-4-common-dementia-accusations-stealing-poisoning-being-held-prisoner/|title=Responding to 4 Common Dementia Accusations: Stealing, Poisoning, Being Held Prisoner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Encyclopedia of Buddhist Arts''' ({{Lang-zh|t=世界佛教美術圖說大辭典|p=Shìjiè fójiào měishù túshuō dà cídiǎn}}) is a set of books that was started by the founder of [[Fo Guang Shan]], Venerable Master Hsing Yun. The project started in 2001 and was completed in March 2013. There are 20 volumes in total and the artwork spans all 5 continents with information from more than 30 countries. The project was made possible with the help of numerous scholars and volunteers, 300 monastics, 140 scholars from 16 different countries, and more than 400 volunteers. Fo Guang Shan has donated copies of the encyclopedia to libraries and academic institutions across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem113315.html |title=SOAS Library receives 20-volume Encyclopedia of Buddhist Arts donated by Fo Guang Shan Monastery |last= |first= |date=7 July 2016 |website= [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]] |publisher=[[University of London]] |access-date=17 October 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem113315.html |title=Fo Guang Shan Temple presents Encyclopedia of Buddhist Arts to the Lusi Wong Library

'''Heated glass''' is a [[resistance heater]] created when a transparent, electrically conductive coating is applied to [[float glass]] and then subjected to an [[electric current]]. The [[electric current]] in the coating creates [[heat energy]], which warms the glass until the glass radiates heat.

== Design ==

The manufacturing process begins with the application of a microscopic [[Tin dioxide]] coating to a pane of float glass. This coating is transparent and conducts electricity. Then, two [[busbars]] are applied to the glass as follows: the busbars must be parallel and applied to opposing edges on the same side of the glass pane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energwindows.com/heated_glass.php] http://www.energwindows.com/heated_glass.php&lt;/ref&gt; The surface of the glass between the busbars must be flat.

An electric current flows across the tin(II) oxide coating from one busbar to the other. The [[electrical resistance]] of the coating produces heat energy, which radiates from the glass. The busbars are connected to a power control unit that regulates the flow of [[electricity]] and thus the [[temperature]] of the glass.
In modern architectural projects the heated glass is completely translucent. This technology uses a special metallic coating on the surface of the glass invisible to the naked human eye.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iqglassuk.com/h/products/heated-glass/506/#/section-2] http://www.iqglassuk.com/h/products/heated-glass/506/&lt;/ref&gt;

A pane of heated glass can achieve temperatures up to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). The standard desirable temperature range in buildings is between 104 and 113 degrees Fahrenheit (40 to 44 degrees Celsius). For industrial purposes higher temperatures may be warranted.

== Use ==

The first heated glass was created in 1931 by Protes Glass Company, offered for cars.  Their product was not a success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t-QDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA780&amp;dq=Popular+Mechanics+1931+curtiss&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WL7wTK7dHIygnQfPvO2yCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Mechanics%201931%20curtiss&amp;f=true "Windshield Heated By Wire, Melts Sleet and Snow," November 1931, Popular Mechanics] article bottom of page 780&lt;/ref&gt;

Heated glass was first used on a wide scale in [[World War II]] to prevent aircraft windshields from frosting over in cold weather and high altitudes. It is still used in aviation for this purpose.

Heated glass has been used in architectural applications for the past 30 years to prevent [[condensation]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energwindows.com/stopwindowcondensation.php] Stopping window condensation&lt;/ref&gt; and provide radiant heat. Condensation in buildings can have serious consequences to health and property values.  Heated or radiant glass is generally an enhanced standard two pane insulated glass window using various bus bar technologies to convey the electric current to heat the glass.  Some technologies are patented and permit larger glass areas to be heated than others.  In
 
One university study shows that this heated glass technology is more efficient than other electric heating and can be more efficient than natural gas heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rgiglass.com/tests.html] Kansas State University Tests 2007 and 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Some environmentalists dispute the idea that this is an efficient heating system because even high e-value windows are poor insulators compared to insulated walls, and they believe heating window ejects much of the radiant heat outside. Another criticism is that this type of heating may encourage the use of larger windows in a house, making them less energy efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/green-architecture/throw-energy-out-the-window-with-thermique-heated-glass.html] Treehugger.com Throw Energy Out the Window With Thermique Heated Glass&lt;/ref&gt; This technology has evolved since the late 1950s where it firstly evolved to be used for melting snow on glass roofs and was then effectively inverted and used as the heat source inside the building.

A common commercial use of heated glass is to prevent frost from forming on the glass doors of supermarket freezers. In addition, display cases (such as in convenience stores and delis) use heated glass shelves to keep cooked food items from cooling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appliancedesign.com/CDA/Articles/Feature_Article/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000371271] http://www.appliancedesign.com/CDA/Articles/Feature_Article/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000371271&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human Rights and Climate Change''' is a conceptual and legal framework under which international [[human rights]] and their relationship to [[global warming]] are studied, analyzed, and addressed. The framework has been employed by governments, [[United Nations]] organizations, [[Intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] and [[non-governmental organizations]], human rights and environmental advocates, and academics to guide national and international policy on climate change under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and the core [[international human rights instruments]].
	
	Human rights and climate change analysis focuses on the anticipated consequences to humans associated with global environmental phenomena including [[sea level rise]], [[desertification]], temperature increases, extreme weather events, and changes in precipitation, as well as [[climate change adaptation|adaptation]] and [[climate change mitigation|mitigation]] measures taken by governments in response to those phenomena that may involve human rights or related legal protections.

==History==
In 2005, Inuit activist [[Sheila Watt-Cloutier]] filed a petition to the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] seeking relief "from human rights violations resulting from the impacts of global warming and climate change caused by acts and omissions of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Petition to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights Seeking Relief from Violations Resulting from Global Warming Caused by Acts and Omissions of the United States|date=7 December 2005|url=http://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/files/uploads/icc-files/FINALPetitionICC.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was rejected, but the Commission invited and heard testimony on the relationship between human rights and climate change from representatives for the Inuit in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sieg|first=Richard|title=At International Commission, Inuit Want to See Change in U.S. Policy on Global Warming|url=http://www.vjel.org/news/NEWS100058.html|accessdate=25 April 2012|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year, the Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change "stated explicitly (and for the first time in an international agreement) that 'climate change has clear and immediate implications for the full enjoyment of human rights' and called on the United Nations human rights system to address the issue as a matter of urgency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Limon|first=Marc|title=HUMAN RIGHTS AND CLIMATE CHANGE: CONSTRUCTING A CASE FOR POLITICAL ACTION|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=439–476|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Limon.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Malé Declaration on the Human Dimension of Global Climate Change|date=14 November 2007|url=http://www.ciel.org/Publications/Male_Declaration_Nov07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council#Climate change|UN Human Rights Council]] (HRC) unanimously adopted Resolution 7/23, recognizing that "climate change poses an immediate and far-reaching threat to people and communities around the world and has implications for the full enjoyment of human rights," and citing the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 7/23, Human rights and climate change|date=28 March 2008|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_7_23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HRC reaffirmed and expanded these statements with resolutions 10/4 of 25 March 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and 18/22 of 30 September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=A/HRC/RES/18/22 Human rights and climate change|date=30 September 2011|url=http://daccess-ods.un.org/TMP/6246410.01224518.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) released an analytical study identifying specific rights and people groups likely to be adversely affected by climate disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCHR|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report drew on the submissions of some 30 nations as well as ten [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|United Nations Agencies]] and dozens of other organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=OHCHR|title=OHCHR study on the relationship between climate change and human rights: Submissions and reference documents received|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/HRAndClimateChange/Pages/Submissions.aspx|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report identified displaced persons, conflict and security risks as well as impaired rights of indigenous peoples, women, and children as major concerns.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' {{cite journal|title=Report|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G09/103/44/PDF/G0910344.pdf?OpenElement}}, n.8, at 15-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I, Annex II countries and developing countries|Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC]] reproduced the HRC's language identifying the relationship between human rights and climate change in its report on the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in [[Cancun]], Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conference of the Parties|title=FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, Report of the Conference of the Parties on its sixteenth session, held in Cancun from 29 November to 10 December 2010, Addendum, Part Two: Action taken by the Conference of the Parties at its sixteenth session|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report on the outcome of the Conference emphasized that "Parties should, in all climate change related actions, fully respect human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''Id.''|journal=Decision 1/CP.16, The Cancun Agreements:  Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention|date=15 March 2011|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent years have seen an increased recognition of the link between human rights and the environment, yet there are still many questions surrounding the relationship between them. As a result, in 2012 the HRC established a mandate on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 19/10, Human rights and the environment|date=19 April 2012|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/G12/131/59/PDF/G1213159.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary report by the appointed Independent Expert, John H. Knox, further stated that there needed to be priority in providing greater conceptual clarity to the application of human rights obligations related to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=24 December 2012|issue=A/HRC/22/43|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/RegularSession/Session22/A-HRC-22-43_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, all 78 of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders issued a joint statement on [[Human Rights Day]] calling for states to incorporate their existing obligations under the human rights framework into climate change negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15393&amp;|title=OHCHR {{!}} Statement of the United Nations Special Procedures Mandate Holders on the occasion of the Human Rights Day Geneva, 10 December 2014|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have the effect of bringing the rights of those affected by climate change to the forefront of all response strategies. 

As of March 2015, there is now a [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on human rights and the environment, an extension of the mandate of the former Independent Expert on human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 28/11, Human rights and the environment|date=7 April 2015|url=https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G15/071/78/PDF/G1507178.pdf?OpenElement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris, the Special Rapporteur informed states that they should ensure their human rights obligations encompass the appropriate perspective towards climate change when negotiating future agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=16836&amp;LangID=E|title=OHCHR {{!}} COP21: "States’ human rights obligations encompass climate change" – UN expert|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paris Agreement''', as adopted on the 12 December 2015 at the Conference of the Parties, is the most important indication of increasing awareness towards the relationship between climate change and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment|date=1 February 2016|issue=A/HRC/31/52|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2729611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement is the first climate agreement to recognise the relevance of human rights, stating:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNFCCC|date=12 December 2015|title=Adoption of the Paris Agreement|url=https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/cop21/eng/l09r01.pdf|issue=FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Human rights law and climate change ==
Climate change is inducing not only ecological adjustments, but is also impacting the social, economic, political, cultural and legal aspects of societies around the world. The HRC has affirmed that human rights obligations have the ability to strengthen both international and national policy-making in the area of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=HRC|title=UNHRC Resolution 10/4, Human rights and climate change|date=25 March 2009|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/HRC/resolutions/A_HRC_RES_10_4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Declaration]] provided the basis for further elaboration of a human right to environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/271647969|title=International law and the environment|last=W.|first=Birnie, Patricia|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Boyle, Alan E., Redgwell, Catherine.|isbn=9780198764229|edition=3rd|location=Oxford|oclc=271647969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental protection is not commonly included in human rights treaties. Rather environmental protection is derived from the rights that those treaties protect, such as the rights to life, food and water and health.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/724352139|title=Human rights and climate change : a review of the international legal dimensions.|last=1974-|first=McInerney-Lankford, Siobhán Alice,|date=2011|publisher=World Bank|others=Darrow, Mac., Rajamani, Lavanya., World Bank.|isbn=9780821387207|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=724352139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moving forward, human rights law in the context of climate change policy-making may help to establish minimum standards of basic human rights that can be adopted in international and national mitigation and adaption measures.

==Rights implicated==
	Most international statements on human rights and climate change have emphasized the potential adverse impacts of climate change on the rights to [[right to life|life]], [[right to food|food]], [[right to water|water]], [[right to health|health]], [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to development|development]], and [[right to self-determination|self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Malé Declaration, n.4; UNHRC Resolution 18/22, n.7; A/HRC/10/61, n.8; FCCC/CP/2010/7/Add.1, n.10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Human rights, climate change and cross-border displacement|url = http://www.universal-rights.org/urg-policy-reports/human-rights-climate-change-and-cross-border-displacement-the-role-of-the-international-human-rights-community-in-contributing-to-effective-and-just-solutions/|website = Universal Rights Group|access-date = 2016-02-10|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rights are enumerated in the core conventions of [[international human rights law]], though not all HRC members or UNFCCC parties are signatories of these conventions.

=== Right to life ===
The right to life is protected by Article 6 of the ICCPR where every human being has the inherent right to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=OHCRC|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|date=23 March 1976|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/ccpr.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to life is inextricably linked to the measure of fulfilment of other rights. There are both projected and observed effects that climate change will have on the right to life. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] ('''IPCC''') [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|fourth assessment report]] projected an increase in people suffering from death and injury occurring from an increase in floods, storms, heatwaves, fires and droughts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=UNHRC|title=Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the relationship between climate change and human rights|date=15 January 2009|issue=A/HRC/10/61|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Press/AnalyticalStudy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change will equally affect the right to life through an increase in hunger and malnutrition and related disorder impacting child growth and development, respiratory morbidity and ground-level ozone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rising sea levels is one of the flow-on effects of climate change, resulting from warming water and melting ice sheets.  Measuring sea level rise is a complicated affair, however the IPCC have projected an increase in global mean sea level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sealevel.colorado.edu/content/what-definition-global-mean-sea-level-gmsl-and-its-rate|title=What is the definition of global mean sea level (GMSL) and its rate? {{!}} CU Sea Level Research Group|website=sealevel.colorado.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; of between 0.44m and 0.74m by 2100.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2007|title=Fourth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_full_report.pdf|journal=|volume=|issue=AR4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For low-lying coastal islands such as Male', in the Maldives, a sea level rise of 0.5 metres would inundate 15 per cent of the island by 2025, and flood half of it by 2100.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; As 42 per cent of the population lives within 100m within the coastline, even partial flooding is likely to result in drowning, injury and loss of life.

Observed effects are those where the right to life has already inhibited the right to life. There is difficulty in studying the impacts of climate change itself because of the issue of scale; climate change is measured in decades.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; There is more than 95 per cent chance that [[anthropogenic climate change]] quadrupled the risk of extreme summer heat events in Europe in the decade 1998 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christidis|first=Nikolaos|last2=Stott|first2=Peter A.|last3=Jones|first3=Gareth S.|last4=Shiogama|first4=Hideo|last5=Nozawa|first5=Toru|last6=Luterbacher|first6=Jürg|date=2012-02-01|title=Human activity and anomalously warm seasons in Europe|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.2262/abstract|journal=International Journal of Climatology|language=en|volume=32|issue=2|pages=225–239|doi=10.1002/joc.2262|issn=1097-0088}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a probability of 75 per cent that the 2003 heat wave in Europe was attributable to climate change.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On this basis, the excess mortality rate from this event registered at 15,000 deaths in France alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fouillet|first=A.|last2=Rey|first2=G.|last3=Laurent|first3=F.|last4=Pavillon|first4=G.|last5=Bellec|first5=S.|last6=Guihenneuc-Jouyaux|first6=C.|last7=Clavel|first7=J.|last8=Jougla|first8=E.|last9=Hémon|first9=Denis|title=Excess mortality related to the August 2003 heat wave in France|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4|journal=International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health|language=en|volume=80|issue=1|pages=16–24|doi=10.1007/s00420-006-0089-4|issn=0340-0131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to food ===
This is derived from Article II of the ICESCR where States party to the Covenant have to maximise their available resources to the achieve the right to adequate food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}: article 2(1), 11(1) and 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to affect all four pillars of [[food security]]; availability, access, utilization and stability. A 2008 report by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food has stated that the way the world grows food will have to undergo radical change to cope with a growing population and the effects of climate change, while avoiding environmental collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Building resilience: a human rights framework for world food and nutrition security |date=8 September 2008|issue=A/HRC/9/23|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/food/docs/A.HRC.9.23.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Paris Agreement recognises the fundamental priority of ensuring food security and the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to the adverse impacts of climate change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Article 2 calls for adaption to the adverse impacts of climate change and the lowering of greenhouse gas emissions in a manner that will not threaten food production.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The IPCC fourth assessment report projects that food production will increase in the mid to high latitudes with a temperature increase of between 1° and 3&amp;nbsp;°C, however at lower latitudes crop productivity is set to decrease which increases the risk of food insecurity in poorer regions of the world.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] estimate an additional 600 million people will face malnutrition due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=UNDP|first=|date=2007|title=Fighting climate change: Human solidarity in a divided world|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/corporate/HDR/2006%20Global%20HDR/HDR-2006-Beyond%20scarcity-Power-poverty-and-the-global-water-crisis.pdf|journal=Human Development Report|volume=|pages=8|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely to have a particularly devastating effect on Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=IPCC|title=Working Group II Report|date=2007|issue=AR4|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg2/ar4_wg2_full_report.pdf|pages=275|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to water ===
The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ('''CESCR''') notes that the right to water is not only an essential condition to survival, but also that it is inextricably linked with other rights, such as; [[right to housing|housing]], [[right to health|attainable standard of health]], [[right to an adequate standard of living|adequate standard of living]], and [[right to food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=CESCR|title=General Comment No. 15: The Right to Water (Arts. 11 and 12 of the Covenant)  |date=20 January 2003|issue=E/C.12/2002/11|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4538838d11.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stern Review]] states that people will feel the effects of climate change the most strongly through changes in patterns of water distribution around the globe.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006-12-01|title=The Stern Review on the Economic Effects of Climate Change|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x/abstract|journal=Population and Development Review|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2006.00153.x|issn=1728-4457|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those areas that are already experiencing dry conditions will experience a further decrease in water availability, with several (but not all) climate models predicting up to a 30 per cent decrease in annual run-off in the Mediterranean Basin, parts of southern Africa and South America for a 2&amp;nbsp;°C global temperature rise, and 40 – 50 per cent for 4&amp;nbsp;°C rise.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/652432164|title=Human rights and climate change|last=|first=|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Humphreys, Stephen.|year=|isbn=9780521762762|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=652432164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|IPCC fifth assessment report]] states that freshwater-related risks increase significantly with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, with climate change over the 21st century projected to reduce renewable surface water and groundwater resources significantly in most dry subtropical regions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=IPCC|first=|date=2014|title=IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf|journal=|volume=AR5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to health ===
Article 12 of the '''ICESCR''' identifies the "right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most national constitutions protect the right to health in some manner, and it is widely safeguarded in other international and regional instruments.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Rights and Climate Change : A Review of the International Legal Dimensions|last1=McInerney-Lankford|first1=Siobhan|last2=Darrow|first2=Mac|last3=Rajamani|first3=Lavanya|publisher=World Bank Publications|year=2011|isbn=9780821387207|location=|pages=|at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change is going to amplify health disparities between the rich and poor in different parts of the world. The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]] ('''WHO''') estimates that since 1970, climate change is responsible for 150,000 deaths every year through increasing incidence in the spread of diarrhoea, malaria and malnutrition predominantly in Africa and other developing regions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Just a 1&amp;nbsp;°C increase in global temperature from pre-industrial levels could double the annual deaths from climate change (according to WHO).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Specific issues==

===Displacement===
Potential climate induced migration is currently one of the most disputed flow-on effects from climate change. Research suggests that climate change may create some 50 to 200 million new [[internally displaced persons]] and international [[refugees]] by the year 2100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Docherty|first=Bonnie|author2=Tyler Giannini|title=Confronting a Rising Tide: A Proposal for a Convention on Climage Change Refugees|journal=Harvard Environmental Law Review|year=2009|volume=33|pages=349–403|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/elr/vol33_2/Docherty%20Giannini.pdf|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mega-deltas" in Asia, Africa, and small islands are at high risk of floods and storms, which will cause large-scale displacement of the local populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/displacement-caused-by-the-effects-of-climate-change-who-will-be-affected-and-what-are-the-gaps-in-the-normative-framework-for-their-protection/|title=Displacement Caused by the Effects of Climate Change: Who Will Be Affected and What Are the Gaps in the Normative Framework for Their Protection? {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-02-16|newspaper=Brookings|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change induced migration will either affect or violate basic international human right norms.

=== Climate justice ===
There is significant discussion around the concept of climate justice for the [[environmental migrant]] or 'climate refugee'. This concept aims to fill a gap in the legal and political sectors for the millions of people that are not able to receive international legal protection as this source of migration is yet to be included in regional and international law.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987699915|title=Climate change, migration and human rights law and policy perspectives|others=Manou, Dimitra,, Baldwin, Andrew, 1970-, Cubie, Dug,, Mihr, Anja, 1969-, Thorp, Teresa M., 1968-|isbn=9781317222330|location=London|oclc=987699915}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently no established definition for who can be classified as a climate refugee because it has not yet been enshrined in international law. In 2014 Siego Alesana left the [[Small Island Developing States|small island developing state]] of [[Tuvalu]] because of the uncertainty surrounding the adverse effects of climate change.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Citation|title=AD (Tuvalu )|date=4 June 2014|url=http://www.nzlii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/nz/cases/NZIPT/2014/501370.html?query=AD%20(Tuvalu)|issue=501370|accessdate=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuvalu is only 4.6m above sea level and faces the imminent danger posed by rising sea levels. Although the impacts of climate change were put forward on behalf of Alesana and his family, the case rested largely on humanitarian grounds. However the [[Immigration and Protection Tribunal]] did state that environmental degradation caused by climate change was already a feature of life in Tuvalu.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Although this decision wasn't based on impacts of climate change that is not to say that climate change related factors weren't taken into consideration at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vernonrive.com/home/climate-refugees-revisited-a-closer-look-at-the-tuvalu-decision|title="Climate refugees" revisited: a closer look at the Tuvalu decision|website=Vernon Rive|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Organization for Migration]] has put forward a working definition of environmental migrant:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iom.int/definitional-issues|title=Definitional Issues|date=2015-01-29|work=International Organization for Migration|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;Environmental migrants are persons or groups of persons who, predominantly for reasons of sudden or progressive change in the environment that adversely affects their lives or living conditions, are obliged to leave their habitual homes, or choose to do so, either temporarily or permanently, and who move within their country or abroad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Until there is a legally binding definition of what constitutes an environmental migrant, it will be difficult for any true justice to be served. The concept of climate justice would see all human rights implemented in the most transparent way in order to maintain basic standards in the face of the somewhat unknown impacts that will be created by climate change.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Conflict===
International peacebuilding NGO [[International Alert]] names 46 countries where climate change effects (including water scarcity, loss of arable land, extreme weather events, shortened growing seasons, and melting glaciers) may interact with economic, social, and political forces to create "a high risk of violent conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dan|author2=Janani Vivekananda|title=A CLIMATE OF CONFLICT: The links between climate change, peace and war|journal=International Alert|date=November 2007|url=http://www.international-alert.org/sites/default/files/publications/A_climate_of_conflict.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous peoples===
[[Indigenous peoples]] have a unique position when it comes to discussion of the impacts climate change will have on a population. Many indigenous populations live subsistence lifestyles, which in turn are disrupted severely when it comes to the impact of climate change. In many countries, municipal law differs in application to indigenous peoples than the rest of the population which complicates any legal remedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/811732784|title=Climate change and Indigenous peoples : the search for legal remedies|date=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar|others=Abate, Randall., Kronk, Elizabeth Ann.|isbn=9781783474172|location=Cheltenham, UK|oclc=811732784}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change impacts indigenous peoples differently not only because of their physical and spiritual connections to the land and water, but also because they have a specialised ecological and traditional knowledge that can be used to find the best mitigation strategy of those effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerrard|first=Emily|date=2008|title=Climate change and human rights : issues and opportunities for Indigenous peoples|url=|journal=University of New South Wales Law Journal|volume=31|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UN Human Rights organs have identified the [[rights of indigenous peoples]] as particularly vulnerable to the disruptive effects of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;OHCHR: Climate change and indigenous peoples, http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/ClimateChangeIP.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hampson|first=Françoise|title=THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES IN STATES AND TERRITORIES THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS|date=13 July 2004|issue=E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/2004/CRP.1|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/IPeoples/WG/crp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to climate change, indigenous people have been threatened with their livelihood and cultural idententies across the world North America, Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Pacific. Approximately 370 million indigenous people are affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Jay|date=2012-05-01|title=The impact of climate change on indigenous people – the implications for the cultural, spiritual, economic and legal rights of indigenous people|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13642987.2011.632135|journal=The International Journal of Human Rights|volume=16|issue=4|pages=648–688|doi=10.1080/13642987.2011.632135|issn=1364-2987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child Rights===
Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] identified that children in South Asia may be particularly vulnerable to violations of human rights following climate related disasters. These can include gender-based violence, child labour, family break-ups and barriers to their development and learning. The researchers argue that [[child rights]] are rarely prioritised in policies to reduce disaster risk or adapt to climate change and that [[climate change adaptation]] policies must tailor interventions to address critical aspects of child rights, particularly child protection and education.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Harris and Kelly Hawrylyshyn, Climate extremes and child rights in South Asia: a neglected priority, http://www.odi.org.uk/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/7832.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Given that many of the world's poorest citizens depend directly on the environment for all or part of their daily livelihoods, many international development agencies see climate change and development as "inextricably linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=U.S. Agency for International Development|title=Integrating Climate Change into Development|date=November 2008|url=http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACM036.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|author2=The World Bank|title=DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE A Strategic Framework for the World Bank Group|year=2008|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTCC/Resources/407863-1219339233881/DCCSFTechnicalReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khoday|first=Kishan|title=Climate Change and the Right to Development.

==Tales and myths of impalement==

===Europe===

====Vampires and other undead====
The idea that the vampire "can ''only'' be slain with a stake driven through its heart" has been pervasive in European fiction. Examples such as Bram Stoker's [[Dracula]] and the more recent [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy The Vampire Slayer]] and [[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]] series' all incorporate that idea.&lt;ref&gt;For popularity claim and example:[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2155602/Vampire-skeletons-impaled-iron-stakes-say-arent-just-film-fantasy.html Thought vampires were just film fantasy? Skeletons impaled on iron stakes say otherwise]&lt;/ref&gt; In classic European folklore, it was believed that one method, ''among several'', to "kill" a [[vampire]], or prevent a corpse from rising as a vampire, was to drive a wooden stake through the heart before interment.&lt;ref&gt;''Barber'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In one story, an [[Istria]]n peasant named [[Jure Grando]] died and was buried in 1656. It was believed that he returned as a vampire, and at least one villager tried to drive a stake through his heart, but failed in the attempt. Finally, in 1672, the corpse was [[decapitation|decapitated]], and the vampire terror was put to rest.&lt;ref&gt;''Caron'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Eastern European, in particular Slavic (but also Roumanian), conception of the vampire as an undead creature in which impaling it was central to either destroying it, or at least immobilizing it, is the most well-known European tradition, such traditions can also be found elsewhere in Europe. In Greece, the troublesome undead were usually called a [[vrykolakas]]. The archaeologist Susan-Marie Cronkite&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elementshealthspace.com/masthead/ Bio on Cronkite]&lt;/ref&gt; describes an odd grave found at [[Mytilene]], at [[Lesbos]], a find the archeologists connected with the vrykolakas superstition.&lt;ref&gt;''Cronkite''(2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norse [[draugr]], or haugbui (mound-dweller), was a type of undead typically (but not exclusively) associated with those put (supposedly) to rest in burial mounds/[[tumulus|tumuli]]. The approved methods of killing a draugr are "to sever his head from his body and set the same beneath his rump, or impale his body with a stake or burn it to ashes".&lt;ref&gt;''Andrews'' (1913), p.603. Several examples in the essay on grave robbery and encounters with draugr there and elsewhere&lt;/ref&gt;

Although in modern vampiric lore, the stake is regarded as a very effective tool against the undead, people in pre-modern Europe could have their doubts. [[Edward Payson Evans]] tells the following story, from the city [[Kadaň]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Evans'' (1906), [https://books.google.com/books?id=delFlcGFniYC&amp;pg=PA196 p.196]&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|In 1337, a herdsman near the town of Cadan came forth from his grave every night, visiting the villages, terrifying the inhabitants, conversing affably with some and murdering others. Every person, with whom he associated, was doomed to die within eight days and to wander as a vampire after death. In order to keep him in his grave, a stake was driven through his body, but he only laughed at this clumsy attempt to impale a ghost, saying: "You have really rendered me a great service by providing me with a staff, with which to ward off dogs when I go out to walk"}}

====Literary treatment of impalement====
A graphic description of the vertical impalement of a Serbian rebel by Ottoman authorities can be found in [[Ivo Andrić]]'s novel ''[[The Bridge on the Drina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Excerpt of impalement in book can be accessed here: [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Bridge+on+the+Drina+%28excerpts%29.-a0165021314 The Bridge on the Drina]&lt;/ref&gt; Andrić was later awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] for the whole of his literary contribution, though this novel was the ''magnum opus''.&lt;ref&gt;On status as Nobel Laureate, predominantly on basis of Bridge, see: [https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/books/a-reader-s-guide-to-the-balkans.html A Reader's Guide to the Balkans]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anecdotes of the impaled====
Some anecdotes of the behavior and fates of the impaled remain which, if true, would be unique in the history of impalement. The first was narrated as a proof of the efficacy of praying to [[Saint Barbara]]. In the woods of Bohemia around 1552, there was a robber band roaming, plundering and murdering innocent travelers. A manhunt was organized, and the robber chief was apprehended and sentenced to be impaled. While one of his associates, likewise impaled, swiftly expired, the chief was not so lucky.
All day long, he writhed on his stake, begging to be killed, but all in vain. That night, in his despair, he prayed to St. Barbara that he was truly sorry for all his evil doings in life and that all he hoped for was to reconcile with God and to be graced with a good death. Seemingly in response, the man's stake broke, and with great effort and pain, he managed to ''de-impale'' himself. Crawling along, he came to a house, and his cries of help were heard. He was helped into a bed, and a priest was sent for. The former robber chief then gave his death bed confession, grieving over his misspent life, but properly grateful to God and St. Barbara. He then died in peace, his hands folded over his chest.&lt;ref&gt;''Vierholz'' (1737) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jrY_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA493 p.&amp;nbsp;493–95]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident, which was, allegedly, partially witnessed by the editor of a "Ladies' Journal", is said to have occurred in Wallachia in the 1770s. He had been present in [[Arad, Romania|Arad]] when 27 robbers had been impaled. It was strictly forbidden to give the impaled persons any water, but one woman took mercy on one of the robbers, and fetched water for him in a kettle. As she was glancing anxiously about to check if anyone took notice of her forbidden act of mercy, the robber smashed her head in with the kettle, killing her on the spot. The editor avers he was present when the robber was asked why he had done such a thing, and he merely replied he had done it on a whim, and just had felt like killing her then and there.&lt;ref&gt;''Damengesellschaft'' (1785) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3pMSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p.&amp;nbsp;95–97]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americas===
In [[British Columbia]], a folk tale from the [[Lillooet people|Lillooet People]] is preserved in which impalement occurs as a central element. A man became suspicious of his wife because she went out each day to gather roots and cedar-bark but hardly ever brought anything home. One day, he spied on her, and discovered that she was cavorting with Lynx, rather than doing her wifely duties. The next day, he asked to accompany her, and they went out in the forest, and came at last to a very tall tree. The man climbed to the top of it, the wife following. The jealous man then sharpened the top of the tree with his knife, and impaled his wife on it. On his way down, he removed the bark of the tree, so it became slick. The woman cried out her pain and her brothers heard her. They and animals they called to help them tried to rescue her, but the stem was too slick for them to climb up to reach her. Then Snail offered to help her, and slowly crawled up the tree. But alas, Snail moved too slowly, and by the time it took him to reach the top of the tree, the woman was dead.&lt;ref&gt;The brothers later on revenged themselves on the husband, through a clever ruse. ''Teit'' (1912), p. 339–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Among tribes living around the [[Titicaca]], tales circulated in the sixteenth century that prior to the [[Incas]], a mysterious group of white men lived there, and their banishment was somehow connected with the birth of the Sun. A sixteenth century tale collected by a Spanish missionary tells of such an individual, called Tanupa or Taapac, who was impaled by other Indians around the Titicaca, and a shrine was set up there to commemorate the events.&lt;ref&gt;''Bandelier'' (1904), impalement incident at p.224&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martyrdom of al-Hallaj===
The renowned Sufi mystic was in AD 922 to be impaled for blasphemy in Baghdad, for having said such things as "I am God". However, the executioners were unable to do so, because al-Hallaj floated in the air just above their reach. Then, al-Hallaj's spirit ascended to Heaven, and conversed with Muhammed, the Prophet of Islam, and al-Hallaj asked the Prophet if he should let himself be impaled. The Prophet acknowledged that al-Hallaj's spiritual state was so heightened that his utterance "I am God" was both just and true, but that for the sake of ordinary people, he should let himself be impaled, because their spiritual state was such that they would be mislead from practical religion if they were to believe in such sayings like "I am God". And thus, for the sake of preserving the religion of ordinary people, al-Hallaj let himself be impaled at last.&lt;ref&gt;Lit.Soc. Bombay (1819), [https://books.google.com/books?id=12soAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 p. 111–113]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
Tales and anecdotes concerning how dreadfully swift and harsh Ottoman justice was for comparatively trivial offenses abound. [[Dimitrie Cantemir]], a Moldavian noble living in Constantinople at the end of the 17th century, and often engaged in pleas of cases towards Ottoman authorities, narrates a tale from the building of a great mosque there in 1461. The Greek architect was amply rewarded by the sultan, so that a whole street was privileged to the Greek populace in recognition of his efforts. However, some asked the architect if he could even build a greater and more beautiful mosque than the one completed. Incautiously, the architect said sure enough, if I were given the materials. The sultan, upon hearing this, was so fearful that his successors might create an even more beautiful mosque than his own, that just in case, he chose to impale the architect to deprive successors of that genius, commemorating the event by erecting a huge iron spike in the middle of the mosque. Not even bothering to refute this tale of impalement, Cantemir says that he ''does'', however, believe in the grand gift of the street, because he had used the original charter from the sultan to protect the Greek interest when somebody wanted to deprive the Greeks of the privilege. Cantemir won his case.&lt;ref&gt;''Cantemir'' (1734), [https://books.google.com/books?id=q3NUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 p.109]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1632, under [[Murad IV]] (r.1623–40), a hapless interpreter in a fierce dispute between the French ambassador and Ottoman authorities was impaled alive for faithfully translating the insolent words of the ambassador.&lt;ref&gt;The French had been accused of bringing a Muslim woman on board a ship, ''Browne'' (1751) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=248&amp;id=XjYLAAAAYAAJ p.248]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Murad IV sought to ban the use of tobacco, and reportedly impaled alive a man and a woman for breaking the law, the one for selling tobacco, the other for using it.&lt;ref&gt;''Sherwood, Jones'' (1825) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=722&amp;id=8esTAAAAIAAJ p.722]&lt;/ref&gt; Another such anecdote, is said to have occurred in 1695 under [[Mustafa II]]: The Grand Vizier prevented access to the sultan to a poor shoemaker who had a petition for his sovereign. Once the sultan learnt of it, he promptly ordered the Grand Vizier to be impaled, although the Grand Vizier was the son of the sultan's favourite concubine.&lt;ref&gt;''Percy'' (1825), [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0k4AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA147 p.147]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian sub-continent===
In the Hindu [[Draupadi]] cult, impalement of animals, demons, and humans is a recurring motif within legends and symbolic re-enactments during holidays/festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alf Hiltebeitel]] (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=diPh4qYtjPUC The Cult of Draupadi]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a [[Shaivite]] story from India, under the old [[Pandyan Dynasty]], ruling from 500 BC-1500 CE, the 7th century King [[Koon Pandiyan]] had 8000 [[Jainism|Jains]] [[Impalement of the Jains in Madurai|impaled in Madurai]]. Some historians regard the story as a legend rather than historically accurate, and that it might have been created by the Shaivites to prove their superiority over the Jains.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sastri|1976|p=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Roy|1984|loc=chapter 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act, legendary or not, is still commemorated in "lurid mural representations" in several Hindu temples in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Paul Dundas|Dundas]]'' (1992) [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C p.127] The author mentions as an example the temple to the war god [[Murugan]] in [[Kalugumalai]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such depictions in temples can be found in the [[Meenakshi Amman Temple]] in [[Madurai]], around the holy tank enclosure to the shrine of [[Meenakshi]]. There, a long line of impaled Jaines are depicted, with dogs at their feet, licking up the blood, and crows flying around to pick out their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;''AES'' (1904), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ybyzrkuQaUEC&amp;pg=PA52 p.52]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representations of impaled members of a different religion than Hinduism seems not to be confined to the Jains, but also to Buddhists. In a temple at Trivatur, not far from Madras (present name [[Chennai]]), for example, the walls "are covered with sculptures representing the execution of Buddhists by the most horrible tortures, the martyrs being impaled alive and left to be devoured by dogs and birds of prey." ''Elliot'' (1869), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NRISAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA109 p.109] This presumably commemorates an alleged persecution of Buddhists in the 2nd century BC under Hindu King [[Pushyamitra Shunga]], as narrated, for example, in 2nd century AD text [[Ashokavadana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bengal, tales existed about a foolish king in the [[Pala Empire]], Bhava Chandra, and his equally foolish minister. They are a pair not unlike the [[Wise Men of Gotham]], bereft of common sense as a result of a curse laid upon them. In their last judgment, they had condemned two robbers to be impaled, but when the robbers began quarreling about who should get impaled on the longest pole, Bhava Chandra and his minister became deeply intrigued. The robbers told them that whoever died on the longest pole would be reincarnated as the ruler of the Earth, while the other would become his minister. Thinking it unseemly that two mere robbers should gain such a high position in their next life, Bhava Chandra chose to impale himself on the longest pole, while his minister happily chose to die on the shorter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[William Wilson Hunter|Hunter]]'' (1875) [https://archive.org/details/astatisticalacc00unkngoog p.313]&lt;/ref&gt;

The remains of persons impaled have, occasionally, been thought imbued with certain magical properties. For example, the [[Arthashastra]] states that if one wishes to make a fire at one place, and prevent any other fire to be lit there, one could make that fire "by the friction of a black-and-white bamboo stick on the rib bone of the left side of a man who has been slain with a sword, or impaled". Virginia Saunders also mentions from the same text how to become invisible:&lt;ref&gt;''Saunders'' (1922), p.422&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Or if invisibility is desired, having fasted three nights one should, on the day of the star Pushya, sprinkle with the milk of goats and sheep, barley planted in soil placed in the skull of a man who has been killed by a sword or has been impaled.}}
The [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Mandavya]], when he was five years old, had amused himself with sticking a reed into a living locust. Lord [[Yama]], the god of death, bided his time to exact what he thought was a proper punishment. As an old man, Mandavya was sitting outside his cave in deep meditation, oblivious to some thieves placing their stolen goods there. Wrongfully believing Mandavya had stolen the goods, the authorities placed Mandavya on trial. He could not answer the judge on how the goods had come to be in his hermitage, so the king declared he was to be impaled. Mandavya seemed unperturbed by the whole affair, and when he was still alive, in deep contemplation, on the stake after 4 years, the king declared Mandavya had to be innocent, and ordered him pulled down. However, the stake broke inside Mandavya's body, and the excruciating pain destroyed Mandavya's trance. In deep bitterness, he asked the gods how he had deserved such a fate, and Yama answered it was because of the locust he had tortured as a young boy. Mandavya became infuriated at Yama and pointed out how disproportionate the punishment had been. He then cursed Yama to be born as a human being, namely as [[Vidura]], the son of a mere serving maid.&lt;ref&gt;Combined from two slightly variant accounts, ''Ward'' (1824), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GlIqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA294 p. 294–95] and ''Garbe'' (1913), p. 334–35&lt;/ref&gt;

A tale from [[Kashmir]] of reincarnation after death on the stake concerns the sage Samdhimati. Samdhimati was minister under King Jayendra, when a mysterious prophecy spread through the populace: "To Samdhimati will belong the kingdom". Jayendra, on hearing of this, threw Samdhimati in prison for 10 years. When the king was on his death bed, he was unwilling to let Samdhimati have the prophecy fulfilled, so he ordered Samdhimati impaled. When Samdhimati's guru Isana heard of this, he went to the cemetery where Samhimati was impaled in order to perform the proper funeral rites. The wolves had devoured all the flesh of the body, and Isana was amazed that the prophecy was inscribed on Samdhimati's skull that he was to inherit the kingdom. Keeping watch, one night Isana saw the graveyard was filled with [[Yogini]]s (female mystics/witches). The Yoginis were drunk and "lustful for a man", and provided the skeleton with flesh (not the least, a penis) from their own bodies. They then captured Samdhimati's spirit, which was still hovering around, within the fleshed skeleton, and "spent the rest of the night sporting with him". As dawn approached, Isana, afraid that Samdhimati's new body should be dissolved by the witches, rushed out from his hiding place, and chased them away. In his new body and life, Samdhimati became known as [[Aryaraja]], and was, indeed, crowned as King of Kashmir, thereby fulfilling the prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;''Brown'' (1919), p. 425–26&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern Asia===
In the Buddhist conception of the eight Hells, as [[John Bowring]] relates from [[Siam]], those consigned for the Sixth Hell are impaled on spits and roasted. When well roasted, enormous dogs with iron teeth devour them. But, the damned are reborn, and must relive this punishment for 16000 years, over and over again&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;''Bowring'' (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=306&amp;id=7tTzwqKN9RIC p.306]&lt;/ref&gt; Another tale popular in Siam was about [[Devadatta]], a wily antagonist to [[Buddha]] seeking to undermine [[Gautama]]'s position among his followers. For this crime, Devadatta was sent off into the very deepest Hell, the [[Avici]], being impaled on three great iron spears in a sea of flames.&lt;ref&gt;''Bowring'' (1857) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=313&amp;id=7tTzwqKN9RIC p.313] For rather similar, vivid depictions of the sufferings in Hell from Buddhist temples in [[Cambodia]], see ''Vincent Jr.'' (1878), p.237&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illusions of impalement==
The 1980 Italian film, ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'', directed by [[Ruggero Deodato]], graphically depicts impalement.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite interview |last=Deodato |first=Ruggero |subjectlink=Ruggero Deodato |interviewer=[[Sage Stallone]]; [[Bob Murawski]] |title=Cult-Con 2000 |location=Tarrytown, New York |date=2000-11-12 |work=Cannibal Holocaust DVD Commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows a rescue party searching for a missing documentary film crew in the [[Amazon Rainforest]].&lt;ref name=sergio&gt;{{cite video | people = D'Offizi, Sergio (interviewee) |date = 2003 | title = In the Jungle: The Making of Cannibal Holocaust | medium = Documentary | location = Italy | publisher = Alan Young Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's depiction of indigenous tribes, death of animals on set, and the graphic violence (notably the impalement scene) brought on a great deal of controversy, legal investigations, boycotts and protests by concerned social groups, bans in many countries (some of which are still in effect), and heavy censorship in countries where it has not been banned.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.refused-classification.com/Films_C.htm#cannibalholocaust | title=Films C | publisher=Refused-Classification.com | accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impalement scene was so realistic, that Deodato was charged with murder at one point. Deodato had to produce evidence that the "impaled" actress was alive in the aftermath of the scene, and had to further explain how the [[special effect]] was done: the actress sat on a [[bicycle seat]] mounted to a pole while she looked up and held a short stake of [[balsa]] wood in her mouth. The charges were dropped.&lt;ref name=sergio/&gt;

In stage magic, the ''[[Impaled (illusion)|illusion of impalement]]'' is a popular feat of magic that appears to be an act of impalement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [http://www.wellingtonent.com/products/impaled.html Impaled]&lt;/ref&gt; Impaling tricks are not, however, a modern European invention, and some [[dervish]] orders performed such acts already in the 18th century. [[Carsten Niebuhr]], traveling the Middle East 1761–67 on a Danish funded expedition, saw such a display at [[Basra]]:&lt;ref&gt;''Pinkerton'' (1811), [https://books.google.com/books?id=HWEOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA172 p.172]&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|"The scene was in the open air, and in the court of the mosque, which was illuminated with only three lamps. Several Mullahs and dervises began with singing some passages out of the Koran. They continued to sing, with the accompaniment of some drums; and, during the music, the other dervises arose, took the sharp pointed irons, and did as if they were piercing their bodies, and even driving the irons with mallets into their flesh. Next appeared the principal actor, who, assuming an air of inspiration, directed the music to proceed, and to be raised to higher animation, in, order to assist his enthusiasm, or rather to stun the ears of the spectators. In his extacy, he threw up his turban in the air, loosened his hair; for this order of dervises wear their hair; and pierced his body with five lances: then mounting upon a low building, upon which a pole, sixteen feet long, and shod with a sharp iron point, had been set up, he impaled himself upon the pole, and was carried in this condition through the square. It was an affecting sight, to see a lean man, with a long beard, and dishevelled hair, wounded all over with spikes, and then carried about spitted upon a pole. I said, as I went away, to a Mullah of my acquaintance, that the dervise performed his tricks by means of a broad belt which he carried in his long wide drawers. The Mullah replied, that he had suspected some such art, but avoided mentioning his suspicions, lest he might draw upon himself the enmity of the order of [[Sheikh Bedreddin|Bed-reddin]]; for that one of his brethren had experienced great persecution from those dervises, in consequence of presuming to hint his doubts of the reality of their miracles."}}

== History and mission ==
[[File:Yale Law School in the Sterling Law Building.jpg|thumb|Yale Law School in the Sterling Law Building]]
The ISP was founded by Yale Law Professor [[Jack Balkin]] in 1997 and celebrated its 15th year in 2012. It now hosts a number of initiatives, including the Abrams Institute for Freedom of Expression, the Knight Law and Media Program, and the Thomson Reuters Initiative on Law and Technology. The center is housed on the fourth floor of 40 Ashmun Street in New Haven.

ISP fellows from around the globe come to pursue research and produce scholarship, in the form of books, articles in academic journals and popular publications, blog posts, and policy documents. Yale ISP faculty and fellows have also conducted major public policy reviews of current issues in technology and law, and written amicus briefs for cases appearing before the Supreme Court and US Courts of Appeal.

==Projects and initiatives==

===Access to Knowledge===

For several years, the ISP has collaborated on A2K projects with partner institutions in Egypt, Brazil, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/access-knowledge/ Access to Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt; This work has involved several workshops and conferences organized by ISP fellows, and culminated in a series of books, including ''Access to Knowledge in India: New Research on Intellectual Property''&lt;ref name="A2K in India"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R_-0-KVs5C0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Access+to+Knowledge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wsQgVM6-NMGUgwSd-oHgAQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Access%20to%20Knowledge%22&amp;f=false], Access to Knowledge in India: New Research on Intellectual Property, London: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Ramesh Subramarian]] and [[Lea Shaver]], and ''Access to Knowledge in Brazil: New Research on Intellectual Property''&lt;ref name="A2K in Brazil"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fEP2smsHVCwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Access+to+Knowledge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wsQgVM6-NMGUgwSd-oHgAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Access%20to%20Knowledge%22&amp;f=false], Access to Knowledge in Brazil: New Research on Intellectual Property, London: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Lea Shaver]].

===Floyd Abrams Institute for Freedom of Expression===

The Institute's mission is both practical and scholarly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/node/4938/ Floyd Abrams Institute for Freedom of Expression]  &lt;/ref&gt;It includes a clinic for Yale Law students to engage in litigation, draft model legislation, and advise lawmakers and policy makers on issues of media freedom and informational access. It promotes scholarship and law reform on emerging questions concerning both traditional and new media. The Institute also holds scholarly conferences and events at Yale on First Amendment issues and on related issues of access to information, Internet and media law, telecommunications, privacy, and intellectual property.

=== Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice ===

The ISP's Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice (PSRJ) serves as a national center for academic research and development of new ideas to promote justice with respect to reproductive health issues, provide a supportive environment for young scholars interested in academic or advocacy careers focusing on reproductive rights and justice issues; and provide opportunities for communication between the academic and advocacy communities. [[Pricilla Smith]] is the program director of PSRJ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/node/4941/ Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic===

The Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic (MFIA) is dedicated to increasing government transparency, defending the essential work of news gatherers, and protecting freedom of expression through [[impact litigation]], direct legal services, and policy work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/media-freedom-and-information-access-clinic/ Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:FOIA 2013.png|thumb|FOIA Boot Camp 2013]]

The clinic was established in 2009 by a group of Yale Law School students and, since then, has provided pro bono representation to clients on a diverse array of matters touching on issues of transparency, free speech, and press freedom. Clients include independent journalists, news organizations, public interest as well as advocacy organizations, activists, and researchers.  The practice is focused in the state and federal courts of Connecticut and New York, although the clinic has represented clients in many other parts of the country as well.

The clinic is co-taught by [[Jack Balkin]], Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment; David Schulz, Abrams Visiting Clinical Lecturer at Yale Law School and Partner at Levine, Sullivan, Koch &amp; Schulz LLP; and [[Jonathan Manes]], Abrams Clinical Fellow and Clinical Lecturer in Law. Schulz and Manes serve as supervising attorneys on the clinic's cases.

Every year, the clinic hosts a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] bootcamp.

MFIA is part of the Abrams Institute for Freedom of Expression, which is affiliated with and administered by the Information Society Project at Yale Law School.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5696">[[File:IEA-Instituto de Economia Agrícola.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Instituto de Economia Agrícola.]]The '''Instituto de Economia Agrícola''' ('''IEA''' - Agricultural Economics Institute), linked to the [[Agência Paulista de Tecnologia dos Agronegócios]] ('''APTA''') is a major public scientific [[research]] institute on economics and [[statistics]] applied to agricultural and farming questions, established in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. The aim to provide technical information to support [[agribusiness]] decision makers and governmental policies.
IEA was generated in the bosom of Dept. of Vegetable Production (DVP), created within [[Secretaria de Agricultura e Abastecimento]] in 1942. During a period to deepen his knowledge of fiber technology area, Agronomical Engineer Dr. Rui Miller Paiva became acquainted with the agricultural economy area and decided to follow that the discipline. Returning to São Paulo, Paiva brought with him ideas and the knowledge that led to the creation of the Rural Studies Commission, DPV’s antecessor, the first Brazilian pole on economic issues related to agriculture.
IEA’s pioneering spirit continued for over 65 years. As early as the end of 1970, for example, researchers from that Institute would carry out assessments about the energetic balance of crops (today the concept is widely used in the discussions on bioenergy) and the effect of the expansion of sugar cane crop on soil use in the São Paulo (replacement of crops). In the latest years, its involvement with techno-science (nanotechnology) and its social and economical effects within agriculture are the highlight.
IEA is a pioneer in probability sampling in order to forecast harvests, price surveys and the calculation of the market basket. Currently, it calculates and disseminates agricultural prices every four weeks, or the countryside inflation. The agriculture prices are a reference for the markets, wholesales, retailers and producers, both on a state and national level.
IEA’s statistical surveys (prices, production, estimates for harvests, labor market, land market) provided a model for other agriculture economics institutions. IEA introduced the MIT methodology (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), as well as the World Bank’s, for the conception and economical assessment of agriculture development projects. The economical, prognostics, and the production costs analyses, the census of São Paulo agriculture and the cattle raising census, and the technical and scientific magazines have proved to be important information sources for decision-making on public and private policies.
The Institute takes part in the formulation of public policies concerning the financing of [[Fundo de Expansão do Agronegócio Paulista]] (FEAP) in addition to contributing to the analyses of the support financing for small-scale agri-industry. Its surveys are used as a basis for choosing the municipalities to be benefited by the subsidy projects for the State’s awarding of rural insurance.
IEA discloses data on São Paulo’s trade balance per group of commodities, and that ranking was developed by the institution itself. It’s also discloses data on São Paulo and Brazil’s agribusiness per added factor (basic and industrialized products) and by use category.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">'''Interpret Scotland''' is an inter-agency initiative between [[Scotland|Scottish]] organisations concerned with [[heritage interpretation]]. It was begun in 1997 and its key aims are to :

* Improve the quality and quantity of interpretation in Scotland
* Promote the co-ordination of interpretation at local and strategic level
* Share resources, expertise and experience to avoid duplicating effort

The Interpret Scotland journal, which is published twice a year, has been running since 2000 and includes articles on all facets of interpretation. Interpret Scotland can be credited with raising awareness of professional heritage interpretation within Scotland, particularly through inter-agency support and networking.

Together with the [[Association for Heritage Interpretation]], Interpret Scotland established a steering group which planned and carried out [[The Vital Spark Interpretation Conference]].

== List of members ==

The Interpret Scotland steering group has expanded over the years and currently consists of :-

* Association for Scottish Visitor Attractions
* [[Council for Scottish Archaeology]]
* [[Forestry Commission]] Scotland
* [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]]
* [[Historic Scotland]]
* [[Museums Galleries Scotland]]
* [[National Archives of Scotland]]
* [[National Galleries of Scotland]]
* [[National Museums of Scotland]]
* [[The National Trust for Scotland]]
* [[Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7194">In a [[storytelling|story]], we detect an '''''isotopy''''' when there is a repetition of a basic meaning trait ([[Seme (semantics)|seme]]); such repetition, establishing some level of familiarity within the story, allows for a uniform reading/interpretation of it. An example of a sentence containing an isotopy is ''I drink some water''.&lt;ref name="KlinkenbergAllodef"/&gt; The two words ''drink'' and ''water'' share a seme (a reference to liquids), and this gives homogeneity to the sentence.

This concept, introduced by [[Greimas]] in 1966, had a major impact on the field of [[semiotics]], and was redefined multiple times.&lt;ref name="SignoGreimasIntro"&gt;''[http://www.signosemio.com/greimas/a_greimas.asp Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127105113/http://www.signosemio.com/greimas/a_greimas.asp |date=2010-01-27 }}'' to Greimas, at [http://www.signosemio.com/a_signo.asp Signo]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Catherine Kerbrat-Orecchioni]] extended the concept to denote the repetition of not only semes, but also other [[semiotic unit]]s (like phonemes for isotopies as [[rhyme]]s, rhythm for [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], etc.).&lt;ref name="Kerbrat76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KotlerDITL"/&gt; [[Umberto Eco]] showed the flaws of using the concept of "repetition", and replaced it with the concept of "direction", redefining isotopy as "the direction taken by an interpretation of the text".&lt;ref name="EcoDefIso80"/&gt;

==Redefinitions==
The concept was highly influential and has been revisited and redefined by multiple authors, starting from Greimas, to his epigons of the ''Paris school'', [[Umberto Eco]],&lt;ref name="EcoDefIso80"&gt;Eco (1980)&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Groupe µ]]'', and others. 

Greimas' initial definition was based on the concept of repetition (also termed recurrence or redundancy), was focused on semantics as it only regarded the repetition semes, and it stressed the role of isotopy of making possible a uniform reading of a story and resolving ambiguities. To quote his first 1966 formulation: "a redundant set of semantic categories which make possible the uniform reading of the story."&lt;ref&gt;Greimas (1970), p.188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Umberto Eco]] [1979] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KlJNp_hUmEIC The role of the reader: explorations in the semiotics of texts]'', Indiana University Press, 1984, Introduction p.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Attardo94Defs"&gt;Attardo (1994) p.76&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1980 [[Umberto Eco]] showed a flaw of using the concept of "repetition". He noted that there are cases in which an isotopy is not a repetition of a seme, like in the French sentence ''l'ami des [[Medicinal plants|simples]] = l'[[Herbalism|herboriste]]'', in which ''ami'' (meaning lover, friend or fan) and ''simples'' (medicinal plants) does not appear to share a seme; to also embrace cases like this, Eco replaced the concept of "repetition" with the concept of "direction", defining isotopy more generally as "a constancy in going in a direction that a text exhibits when submitted to rules of interpretative coherence."&lt;ref name="EcoDefIso80"/&gt;

===Beyond semantic isotopy===
[[Catherine Kerbrat-Orecchioni]] systematically extended the concept of isotopy to denote the repetition of any [[semiotic unit]]. She identified semantic, phonetic, prosodic, stylistic, enunciative, rhetorical, presuppositional, syntactic, phonetic, and narrative isotopies. 

A semantic isotopy, the narrower and most common type of isotopy, the one of Greimas's original definition, is the recurrence of semes. A phonetic isotopy is the recurrence of [[phonomene]]s{{what|date=November 2015}}, like in [[rhyme]], [[assonance]] and [[alliteration]]. A [[prosodic]] isotopy is the recurrence of the same [[rhythm]].&lt;ref name="Kerbrat76"&gt;Kerbrat-Orecchioni (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KotlerDITL"&gt;Kotler in /DITL/ (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EcoDefIso80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilli, Yves ''A propos du texte littéraire et de F. Kafka,'' Volume 311, ''L'isotopie textuelle'', 1.1.c, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the many uses of the term isotopy, Eco concluded that although they all have something in common, isotopy is more of an "umbrella term" that cover all these different phenomena. Semantic isotopies alone can denote at times [[contextual disambiguation]], subcategorization and selection restriction, anaphoric antecedent attribution, morphological agreement, or even other phenomena.&lt;ref name="EcoDefIso80"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Attardo, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derived terms and prefixes==
Many derivative terms of isotopy have been defined, often with an added prefix, like ''bi-isotopy'', which could be used to define an ambiguous expression that has two possible interpretations.&lt;ref name="EcoDefIso80"/&gt;

In the 1970s, the Belgian semioticians known under the name ''[[Groupe µ]]'', introduced the concept of [[allotopy]], conceived as the opposite of an isotopy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info-metaphore.com/definition/allotopie.html Définition de : l'allotopie]&lt;/ref&gt; An allotopy is when two basic meaning traits (semes) contradict each other, as in the sentence ''I drink some concrete''.&lt;ref name="KlinkenbergAllodef"&gt;[[Jean-Marie Klinkenberg]] (1996) ''Précis de sémiotique générale'', De Boeck, p. 118 [http://www.info-metaphore.com/definition/isotopie.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Leviathan and the Air-Pump: Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life''''' (published 1985) is a book by [[Steven Shapin]] and [[Simon Schaffer]]. It examines the debate between [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] over Boyle's air-pump experiments in the 1660s. In 2005, Shapin and Schaffer were awarded the [[Erasmus Prize]] for this work.

On a theoretical level, the book explores the acceptable methods of knowledge production, and societal factors related to the different knowledge systems promoted by Boyle and Hobbes. The "Leviathan" in the title refers to Hobbes's book on the structure of society, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil]]'' and the "Air-Pump" refers to Robert Boyle's invention. The book also contains a translation by Schaffer of Hobbes's ''Dialogus physicus de natura aeris''. It attacked Boyle and others who founded the society for experimental research, soon known as the [[Royal Society]].

== Intention of the work ==
Shapin and Schaffer state, in their first chapter ''Understanding Experiment'', that they wish to answer the question, "Why does one do experiments in order to arrive at scientific truth?"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Their aim is to use a historical account of the debate over the validity of Boyle's air pump experiments, and by extension his [[experimental method]], to discover the origins of the credibility that we give experimentally produced facts today.  The authors wish to avoid "'The self-evident'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 4"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 4&lt;/ref&gt; method, which (they explain) is when historians project the values of their current culture onto the time period that they are studying (in this case valuing the benefits of [[empiricism]]).  They wish to take a "stranger's"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 4"/&gt; viewpoint when examining the debate between Hobbes and Boyle because, in the 1660s, both methods of knowledge production were well respected in the academic community&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and the reasons that Boyle's experimentalism prevailed over Hobbes's [[natural philosophy]] would not have been obvious to contemporaries.

They explain that, traditionally, Hobbes's position on natural philosophy has been dismissed by historians because historians perceived Hobbes as "misunderstanding"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle's work.  Thus, in ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'', Shapin and Schaffer aim to avoid bias and consider both sides' arguments with equal weight. In addition, they comment on the social instability of [[English Restoration|Restoration]] society post-1660.  They aim to show that the debate between these two contemporaries had political fallout beyond the intellectual sphere, and that accepting Hobbes or Boyle's method of knowledge production was also to accept a social philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
== Chapter II: Seeing and Believing: The Experimental Production of Pneumatic Facts ==
Chapter two outlines Boyle's theory of knowledge production, which revolves around the creation of the "matter of fact".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to an experimentally generated piece of knowledge separate from a universal theory and that was based on probability.  This is in direct opposition to Hobbes (discussed in chapter 3), who required "absolute certainty" based on "logic and geometry" to consider a phenomenon a fact.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  In the eyes of Boyle and his colleagues, the abandonment of absolute certainty was not "a regrettable retreat from more ambitious goals; it was celebrated as a wise rejection of a failed project".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, because "matters of fact" did not have to be absolute, universal assent was not necessary for the production of knowledge.  Boyle made use of three knowledge-producing technologies in order to produce knowledge: "a ''material technology'' embedded in the construction and operation of the air-pump; a ''literary technology'' by means of which the phenomena produced by the pump were made known to those who were not direct witnesses; and a ''social technology'' that incorporated the conventions that experimental philosophers should use in dealing with each other and considering knowledge-claims".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, Shapin and Schaffer give a description of the "material technology," the air-pump itself, essentially a [[suction pump]] attached to a replaceable glass bulb.  When the pump was set in motion, the air would be evacuated from the glass bulb thus creating what we now consider to be a vacuum, but what for contemporaries was a space of great debate (explained below).  However, the integrity of the pump was far from perfect and this leaking is central to the arguments both for and against experimentalism.  Shapin and Schaffer assert that three important points should be taken into account when considering the pump itself: "(1) that both the engine's integrity and its limited leakage were important resources for Boyle in validating his pneumatic finding and their proper interpretation; (2) that the physical integrity of the machine was vital to the perceived integrity of the knowledge the machine helped to produce; and (3) that the lack of its physical integrity was a strategy used by critics, particularly Hobbes, to deconstruct Boyle's claims and to substitute alternative accounts".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

The arguments about experimentally generated knowledge revolve around two of Boyle's experiments.  The first experiment is the [[Torricellian apparatus]] placed within the exhausted receiver (the bulb).  The result is that the liquid in the inverted tube of the Torricellian apparatus falls, but not to the level of the liquid in the dish at the base of the inverted tube.  For Boyle, the water level fell because the air was being evacuated from the bulb and thus its spring and weight were no longer acting on the liquid around the base of the tube holding the liquid in the inverted tube up.  The fact that the water did not fall completely to the bottom of the tube was explained (for Boyle) by the existence of air in the bulb that occurred due to leakage.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  However Boyle was careful not to commit to saying that a vacuum existed in the bulb; he stated only that when air was sucked out of the bulb the level of the liquid in the inverted tube fell&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt; - this was the nature of a matter of fact.  The second experiment was based on the theory of cohesion - that "two smooth bodies, such as marble or glass discs, can be made spontaneously to cohere when pressed against each other".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 47&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyle's idea was that if two cohered discs were placed in the receiver of the air-pump they would spontaneously separate without the air's pressure to keep them together.  However, when the receiver was evacuated, they did not separate - a result which Boyle blamed on leakage and the fact that he could not get enough air out of the receiver to reduce the air's pressure to an appropriate level.  It should be noted here that Boyle's definitions of "pressure" and "spring" were never clearly defined,&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 54&lt;/ref&gt; which we shall see is one of Hobbes's major complaints.

The air-pump granted access to a whole new branch of "elaborate" experiments.  In order to witness the phenomena produced by the pump, one had to have access to a pump - which was vastly expensive and difficult to build.  However, the space in which the existing pumps did work was arguably a public space - albeit a restricted one.  "The laboratory was, therefore, a disciplined space, where experimental, discursive, and social practices were collectively controlled by competent members".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  The collective viewing of the air-pump experiments avoided the problem of single eye-witness testimony (which was unreliable), and it offered a space for discourse.  This social space for discourse had two important restrictions: "dispute over matters of fact" was not allowed, and "the rules of the game by which maters of fact were experimentally produced" was not to be disputed.&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 60"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 60&lt;/ref&gt;  "In Boyle's view the capacity of experiments to yield matters of fact depended not only upon their actual performance but essentially upon the assurance of the relevant community that they had been so performed".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 55"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to expand his audience (and credibility) Boyle recommended to the academic community that replication was crucial, though he admitted that others "[would] find it no easy task".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 60"/&gt;  As such, the literary technology was used to create "virtual witnessing"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 55"/&gt; - a technique in which description of the experimental scene is written so that the reader can envision the experiment.  "Stipulations about how to write proper scientific prose were dispersed throughout [Boyle's] experimental reports of the 1660s, but he also composed a special tract on the subject of 'experimental essays.'"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 63&lt;/ref&gt;  Everything about how Boyle instructed other experimentalists to write stressed honesty.  He wanted readers to read circumstantial accounts of failed experiments as well as successes, and he asserted that all physical causes should be stated as only "probable."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In summation, Boyle's theory of knowledge production revolves around assent.  All three technologies work towards allowing as many people as possible to come to an agreement about a "matter of fact."

== Chapter III: Seeing Double: Hobbes's Politics of Plenism before 1660 ==
The third chapter centers on Hobbes' side of the debate for the effective production of knowledge.  However, unlike Boyle, Hobbes denies that natural philosophy can be separated from politics and religion.  In the previous chapter, Boyle's "matter of fact" worked towards separation from church and state by remaining objective and probabilistic.  For Hobbes, however, "the boundaries Boyle proposed to erect and maintain were guarantees of continued disorder, not remedies to philosophical dissension".&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  Hobbes also argued for "proper metaphysical language", in contrast to Boyle's reluctance to address the issue of a vacuum and his vague concept of air "pressure."  Hobbes was motivated by three things in his attack on Boyle: (1) to save his own reputation as a natural philosopher, (2) to develop a system of knowledge production that secured order and maintained proper goals for natural philosophy (namely precision instead of probability) and (3) to be sensitive to the needs of Restoration society (discussed in more detail in chapter 7).&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 83"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes' denial of a vacuum stems in part from a need for political stability.  It follows logically that if there can be a space which is devoid of matter, then that is proof of "incorporeal substance"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 83"/&gt; - an idea that was adopted by priests to gain the allegiance of the people by promising the safety of this substance, the immortal soul.  This splits the allegiance of each person in a country between the Church and the Monarch, which creates social instability and ultimately, for Hobbes, the risk of civil war.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 94&lt;/ref&gt;  He considered incorporeal substance a priestly conspiracy to "usurp power" from the true and legitimate leader - the King.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 96&lt;/ref&gt;  The conflict could be resolved "by collapsing the hierarchy [spiritual government and material government] in favour of matter".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 98"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  "It was to that end that Leviathan proffered a materialist and monist natural philosophy.".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 98"/&gt;

''Leviathan'' also instructs that the way to produce good theories is through good definition of terms, the use of materialist and monist theory, and the equal importance of ontology and epistemology ("Show men what knowledge is and you will show them the grounds of assent and social order"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 100&lt;/ref&gt;).  Hobbes works from a model of geometry, and the aims of his natural philosophy share the same precision as geometry.  That is why, for Hobbes, good definition is extremely important.  Hobbes also rejects the idea that the senses were reliable enough to be able to provide factual knowledge&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102&lt;/ref&gt; because "the same impressions could be obtained dreaming or waking, by the motions of matter in real external object or by rubbing the eyes".&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102"/&gt;  Instead, Hobbes posits that man's own agency is the place for natural philosophy, once again drawing on geometry: "'as we know, that, if the figure shown be a circle, then any straight line through the centre shall divide it into two equal parts.'  'And this,' Hobbes said, 'is the knowledge required in a philosopher.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 102"/&gt;  Thus, belief played no part in Hobbes' concept of a fact, and this ran in opposition to Boyle because Boyle's "matters of fact" required the consensus of a group of witnesses who all believed the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 104&lt;/ref&gt;  "Knowledge was constituted when all believed alike.  Likewise for Boyle's clerical allies, religion was a matter of belief and giving witness to that belief...[Hobbes] strategy was one of behavioural control, not one of internal moral control.  It was not that the control of belief was wrong; it was that such control was impractical and an inadequate surety for order."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Artfully, this chapter ends, "For Hobbes, the rejection of vacuum was the elimination of a space within which dissension could take place."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter IV: The Trouble with Experiment: Hobbes versus Boyle ==
As the chapter title suggests, this chapter focuses on how these two historical figures interacted.  It starts with a list of Hobbes' criticisms of Boyle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
- [Hobbes] was skeptical about the allegedly public and witnessed character of experimental performances, and, therefore, of the capacity to generate consensus, even within the experimental rules of the game.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He regarded the experimental programme as otiose.  It was pointless to perform a systematic series of experiments, for if one could, in fact, discern causes from natural effects, then a single experiment should suffice.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He denied the status of "philosophy" to the outcome of the experimental programme.  "Philosophy", for Hobbes, was the practice of demonstrating how effects followed from causes, or of inferring causes from effects.  The experimental programme failed to satisfy this definition.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He systematically refused to credit experimentalists' claims that one could establish a procedural boundary between observing the positive regularities produced by experiment (facts) and identifying the physical cause that accounts for them (theories).
&lt;br /&gt;
- He persistently treated experimentalists' "hypotheses" and "conjectures" as statements about real causes.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He contended that, whatever hypothetical cause or state of nature Boyle adduced to explain his experimentally produced phenomena, an alternative and superior explanation could be proffered and was, in fact, already available.  In particular, Hobbes stipulated that Boyle's explanations invoked vacuism.  Hobbes's alternatives proceed from plenism.
&lt;br /&gt;
- He asserted the inherently defeasible character of experimental systems and therefore the knowledge experimental practices produced.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 111&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hobbes criticized Boyle's experimental space for being private (as it was exclusive to everyone but empiricists) and insisted that the space had a "master"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 113&lt;/ref&gt; - which undermined Boyle's concept of free discourse and consensus to generate matters of fact.  Also he criticized the fact that, since the whole experimental community must come into agreement before a "matter of fact" can be produced, the whole experimental community must view the same demonstration at the same time.  This was an obvious impossibility and was problematic for Boyle because "If they were not witnessed simultaneously and together, then in what ways was the evaluation of experimental testimony different from the evaluation of testimony generally?"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes also criticized the air-pump itself, saying that "the physical integrity of the machine was massively violated."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 115&lt;/ref&gt;  He asserted that "it was impossible to understand the air-pump experiments 'unless the nature of the air is known first.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 117"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 117&lt;/ref&gt;  This was important for three reasons: (1) because Hobbes said the fluidity of the air ruled out the ability to produce an impermeable seal (2) because describing the air as mixture allowed Hobbes to explain the pumps actions (drawing out the course aspects of the air and leaving behind the more subtle fluid) and (3) because Hobbes said that, since Boyle could not offer a cause for the spring of the air, that made him an inadequate natural philosopher.&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 117"/&gt;  Indeed, it was Boyle's recommendation to ignore causes that Hobbes found intolerable.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt;  It was not an objection to the empirical method.  Hobbes only ever doubted the senses as a reliable source of information.  He makes an example of the motion of a person's blood, "for no one feels the motion of their blood unless it pours forth,"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 127"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt; as proof of the unreliability of the senses.  Yet he did not object to Harvey's work to prove the motion of the blood - rather he even considered himself a "methodological ally" of Harvey's "both denying the foundational nature and of personal experience."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 127"/&gt;

"Thus for Hobbes, the task of the natural philosopher was to approach as near as he could to the products of the geometer and the civic philosopher"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 151&lt;/ref&gt; while "Boyle's compulsion was only partial; there was room to differ and tolerance was essential to the maintenance of this partial and liberal compulsion.  Managed dissent within the moral community of experimentalists was safe.  Uncontrollable divisiveness and civil war followed from any other course."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter V: Boyle's Adversaries: Experiment Defended ==
While the previous chapter focuses on the attacks of Boyle's main opponent (Hobbes), this chapter focuses on Boyle's actions in the face of more general adversity.  The three main opponents to Boyle were Hobbes, Linus and More, and Boyle's response to each in turn reflects his opinion of their ideas and shows what parts of his own ideas he deemed essential and what parts he deemed less so.  The figures can be divided into two groups: Linus - who conformed to the model of the experimental programme but did not agree with Boyle's explanation of the air-pump experiments, and Hobbes and More - who attacked the experimental programme as an institution.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

"Linus said there was no vacuum in the Torricellian space.  This was apparent because one could see through that space; if there were a vacuum, 'no visible species could proceed either from it, or through it, unto the eye."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 157"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 157&lt;/ref&gt;  Linus offered a nonmechanical solution to the sustained height of the liquid in the Torricellian apparatus.  He suggested that "a certain internal thread (funiculus) whose upper extremity was attached to the finger [blocking the top of the inverted tube] and whose lower extremity was attached to the surface of the mercury."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 157"/&gt;  He also explained that, in the marble disc experiment, the fault was not with the air-pump but rather with Boyle's theory of the spring of the air.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 159&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, as far as experimental procedure was concerned, Linus was following the rules. So how would Boyle respond?  While Boyle's response contained a restatement of the rules of experimentation, a restatement of the boundaries of experimental philosophy, a defense of his mechanical interpretation, and a particular defense of the spring of the air, Boyle took great pains to "make clear that he generally approved of Linus's manner of constructing and delivering his criticisms."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 163&lt;/ref&gt;  Linus was fully welcomed into the experimental community despite his difference of opinion.  Thus, "in his ''Defense'' Boyle would therefore demonstrate not merely that Linus was wrong, but also how experimental controversies ought to be conducted."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 155&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''Defense'', Boyle restated that "he could not understand why Linus, like Hobbes, had attacked him as a vacuist when he had explicitly declared his nescience on the matter and had identified the question as metaphysical in character" and thus out of the range of experimental exploration.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 168&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobbes on the other hand attacked the validity of the experimental programme itself.  "Boyle's response to Hobbes was fundamentally a defense of the integrity and value of experimental practices."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  Boyle's reply included a technical response detailing the changes he had made to the pump (immersing it in water), a reiteration of the rules of experimental discourse, "an experimental programme devoted to clearing up the troubles which Hobbes had pointed to in his comments on New Experiments," and an ideological rejection of Hobbes's natural philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 170&lt;/ref&gt;  In his reiteration of the rules of experimental discourse he defended his empirical method by asserting that the argument was over the interpretation of matters of fact and not the facts themselves, thus keeping the experimental way of life out of the line of fire.  In response to Hobbes's criticism that the air had a subtler part that permeated the pump, Boyle stated that "this aether must either be demonstrated by experiment to exist or it was to be regarded as a metaphysical entity",&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 181&lt;/ref&gt; which Boyle has excluded from the scope of the experimental method.

Henry More had three main arguments in relation to Boyle: "(1) that matter itself was passive, inert and stupid; (2) that its motion was guided by 'some Immaterial Being that exercises its directive Activity on the Matter of the World'; (3) that mechanism alone was an inadequate way of accounting for Boyle's phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 211&lt;/ref&gt;  He insisted that natural philosophy could be used "as [a weapon] in theology"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 212&lt;/ref&gt; which we have seen is an area that Boyle wished to keep separate from the experimental method.  Thus, in response, Boyle "defended the autonomy and status of his [experimental] community" as separate from other social bodies (such as the Church)&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 215&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote "of 'the doctor's grand and laudable design, wherein [he] heartily wish[ed] him much success of proving the existence of an incorporeal substance.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 217"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 217&lt;/ref&gt;  "Boyle argued that because More's spirit was not a physical principle it could not be part of the language of organized experimenters."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 217"/&gt;

Thus, from this chapter we see that above all Boyle wished to defend his experimental method, its separation from other bodies of knowledge, and lastly his personal claims about the spring of the air.

== Chapter VI: Replication and Its Troubles: Air-Pumps in the 1660s ==
Chapter 6 is an evaluation of the technologies stated in chapter 2 and their role in replication - namely replication of the material technology and the utility of virtual witnessing.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 225&lt;/ref&gt;  The chapter focuses on the propagation of the pump via the experimental community.

The air-pump was first developed in Oxford and London with the help of the Royal Society (and in response to Hobbes criticism) beginning in 1659.  It was during its development that Robert Moray wrote to Christiaan Huygens (Holland) detailing the changes Boyle would be making to the original design of his pump.  Huygens rejected Boyle's changes and set about making his own alterations.  "Christiaan Huygens was the only natural philosopher in the 1660s who built an air-pump that was outside the direct management of Boyle and Hooke."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 235&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of Huygens development, Huygens claimed that "my pneumatic pump was begun to work since yesterday, and all that night a bladder stayed inflated within it [which was a test for the goodness of a pump]...which Mr. Boyle was not able to effect."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, he discovered a phenomenon called anomalous suspension (the suspension of water in a Toricellian apparatus when the water was purged of air, but when a bubble was introduced the water fell) "whose outcome measured the excellence of any air-pump...[and] to interpret this calibration phenomenon, Huygens had summoned into existence a new fluid and challenged the sufficiency of the weight and spring of common air.  The effect of this fluid was only visible in good pumps."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "for more than eighteen months neither of Huygens' claims were granted the status of matters of fact" and it is in this time period that we see how the troubles of replication were dealt with by contemporaries.  The dispute resulted in a flurry of letters between Boyle and Huygens, each attacking the integrity of the other's machine (and by extension the theories of their makers).  "So in March and April 1663 it became clear that unless the phenomenon could be produced in England with one of the two pumps available, then no one in England would accept the claims Huygens had made, or his competence in working the pump"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 249&lt;/ref&gt; - full and complete breakdown of the technology of virtual witnessing.  Thus, Huygens travelled to London and became part of the Royal Society and replicated his matter of fact.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with replication was that the pumps were constantly being rebuilt, and so results would vary with each reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shapin and Schaffer there were two main problems with replication in the 1660s.  (1) "The accomplishment of replication was dependent on contingent acts of judgment.  One cannot write down a formula saying when replication was or was not achieved" and (2) "if replication is the technology which turn belief into knowledge, then knowledge-production depends not just on the abstract exchange of paper and ideas but on the practical social regulation of men and machines."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 282&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, "the effective solution to the problem of knowledge was predicated upon a solution to the problem of social order."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 283"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 283&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chapter VII: Natural Philosophy and the Restoration: Interests in Dispute ==
"Hobbes and Boyle used the work of the 1640s and 1650s to give rival accounts of the right way to conduct natural philosophy"&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 284&lt;/ref&gt; and, in chapter 7, Shapin and Schaffer show how those models were interpreted and supported by Restoration society.  "The experience of the War and the Republic showed that disputed knowledge produced civil strife...Boyle's technologies could only gain assent within a secure social space for experimental practice...[while] Hobbes assaulted the security of that space because it was yet one more case of divided power."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 283"/&gt;

In essence, Boyle's theory and Hobbes's theory are inspired by the same problem: what to do when people can't agree on the truth.  Boyle's supporters  "Wilkins and Ward were ejected from the universities...they argued against each other about the virtues of toleration or suppression of Dissent.  Wilkins attacked the Uniformity Act as too coercive: he would have preferred that the Church 'stand without whipping.'"&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301&lt;/ref&gt;  "These exchanges give considerable point to the proposals that Boyle and his allies produced for the establishment of a social space in which dissent would be safe and tolerable."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301"/&gt;  In addition, "Sprat's ''History of the Royal Society'' (1667) labeled Hobbesian dogmatism as tyranny, and uncontrolled private judgement as enthusiasm.  Such dangers were to be excluded from the community - otherwise debate would not be safe."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 301"/&gt;  "The works of Barlow, Pett, and Dury argued that the balance of disputing sects was better than a state that included a cowed and disaffected party coerced into silence."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 302&lt;/ref&gt;  "With Hobbes in view...[[Joseph Glanvill|Glanvill]] insisted that 'dogmatizing is the great disturber both of our selves, and the world with-out us: for while we wed an opinion, we resolvedly ingage against every one that opposeth it...hence grow Schisms, heresies, and anomalies beyond Arithmetick."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

Adversaries of the experimental method took offense in two ways.  The first was to "satirize the low status of experimental labour" and label their discipline as little more than children playing with toys.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 307&lt;/ref&gt;  And the second, more social ingrained argument, was that the division between Church and the discovery of "matters of fact" "would weaken, rather than strengthen, the fortunes of the Church."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 308&lt;/ref&gt;  "Boyle portrayed the work of experiment as distinct from that of the Church.  Yet its work was also valuable for the churchmen.  If the rules of the experimental game were obeyed, then the game would work well for the godly.  These were the aspects of experimental philosophy that More and his allies found useful at the Restoration."&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 310"&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 310&lt;/ref&gt;  As we have seen previously, this allied relationship between natural philosophy and the clergy was unacceptable to Hobbes because it undermined the political authority of the King and caused social instability by splitting the allegiances of the his subjects between his own temporal authority over their bodies and the spiritual authority harnessed by the clergy&lt;ref name="Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 310"/&gt;

== Chapter VIII: The Polity of Science: Conclusions ==
In the final chapter of ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'', Shapin and Schaffer condense their vastly complicated picture of Restoration society and how it interacted with the development of modern science to three points.  "First, scientific practitioners have created, selected, and maintained a [[polity]] within which they operate and make intellectual product; second, the intellectual product made within that polity has become an element in political activity and in the state; third, there is a conditional relationship between the nature of the polity occupied by scientific intellectual and the nature of the wider polity."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 332&lt;/ref&gt;  In proving those three points they say they had three things to connect: "(1) the polity of the intellectual community; (2) the solution to the practical problem of making and justifying knowledge; and (3) the polity of the wider society" and that they did so by connection three things: "(1) that the solution to the problem of knowledge is political...(2) that the knowledge thus produced and authenticated become an element in political action in the wider polity...[and] (3) that the contest among alternative forms of life and their characteristic forms of intellectual product depend on the political success of the various candidates in insinuating themselves into the activities of other institutions and other interest groups.  He who has the most, and the most powerful, allies wins."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 342&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a departure from the "self-evident" scholars who attribute the victory of the empirical method to its inherent "goodness" (discussed in chapter 1).

They end by relating their examination of Restoration society to their current social climate in the late twentieth century:  "As we come to recognize the conventional and artifactual status of our forms of knowing, we put ourselves in a position to realize that it is ourselves and not reality that is responsible for what we know.  Knowledge, as much as the state, is the product of human actions.  Hobbes was right."&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer 1985, pp. 344&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

== Reception of ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'' ==
The work has been described as a classic example in the [[history of science]] of the posing of a basic question on [[scientific rationality]]. Can the rationality of two sides in a debate be described, from outside, when hindsight operates and the "road not taken" by science is known?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=austin harrington|author2=Barbara L. Marshall|author3=Hans-Peter Mèuller|title=Encyclopedia of Social Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWHoZJ8RzhoC&amp;pg=PA534|accessdate=11 May 2013|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-29046-3|pages=534–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret C. Jacob wrote that, for a time, it was the most influential book in the field of history of science, following the trend to [[relativism]] with its equation of "scientific discourses" with "strategies of power".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Victoria E.

J. L. Heilbron credits Shapin and Schaffer with picking important aspects of the development of experimental culture that are still relevant, citing specifically the problems with replication.  However, he casts doubt upon the strength of the relationship between politics of the greater society and the politics within the Royal Society.  In addition, Heilbron laments the absence of comparisons to the development of empiricism in the rest of Europe because it blinds the reader to what may have been peculiar to England's case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1035825 | year = 1989 | author1 = Heilbron | first1 = J. L. | title = Leviathan and the air-pump. Hobbes, Boyle, and the experimental life | journal = Medical History | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 256–257 | doi=10.1017/s0025727300049292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anna Marie Roos, on the other hand, writes that Shapin and Schaffer do indeed draw a connection between the history of science and the history of political thought, and that their resolution to remain impartial when examining the argument between Hobbes and Boyle forces historians of science and politics alike to recognize the relationship between the two branches of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Roos http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=25967955484936&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawrence M. Principe, in ''The Aspiring Adept: Robert Boyle and His Alchemical Quest'', argues extensively that many of the conclusions reached by Shapin and Schaffer rest on inaccurate and at times presentist conceptions of Boyle's work.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Principe. ''The Aspiring Adept: Robert Boyle and His Alchemical Quest''. Princeton University Press, Princeton 1998. {{ISBN|0-691-01678-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noel Malcolm and Cees Leijenhorst deny the political background of the Hobbes-Boyle controversy. They argue that Hobbes’ rejection of the void has no political agenda and has nothing to do with his attack on [[incorporeal substances]], as Shapin and Schaffer claim. Both Malcolm and Leijenhorst call attention to the remarkable fact that Hobbes was already attacking incorporeal substances when he was a [[vacuist]], and long before he became a [[plenist]].&lt;ref&gt;Noel Malcolm: ''Aspects of Hobbes''. Oxford University Press, Oxford 2002. {{ISBN|0-19-924714-5}}. pp. 187-191.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cees Leijenhorst: ''The Mechanisation of Aristotelianism: the Late Aristotelian Setting of Thomas Hobbes’ Natural Philosophy''. Brill, Leiden 2002. {{ISBN|90-04-11729-6}}. p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Horstmann, in ''Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas Hobbes in der Luftpumpe'', has criticized Shapin and Schaffer's use of the historical evidence. He argues that Shapin and Schaffer have a lot of important facts wrong. Before May 1648, for example, Hobbes preferred vacuist interpretations of experimental pneumatics and strictly rejected plenist interpretations as ''not imaginable'';&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hobbes: ''Thomas White’s De Mundo Examined''. Bradford University Press, London 1976. p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; but Shapin and Schaffer turn the vacuist into a plenist by ignoring all the vacuist interpretations and by producing a very faulty translation as a putative proof for a plenist interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Shapin &amp; Schaffer, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Horstmann argues that there are many similar errors and wrong quotations in ''Leviathan and the Air-Pump'' and suggests that the chapters dealing with Hobbes are constructed on heavy and sometimes systematic misrepresentations of the historical record.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Horstmann: ''Leviathan und die Erpumper. Erinnerungen an Thomas Hobbes in der Luftpumpe''. Mackensen, Berlin 2012. {{ISBN|978-3-926535-52-8}}. ''Leviathan und die Erpumper''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7454">A '''magnetorheological damper''' or '''magnetorheological shock absorber''' is a [[shock absorber|damper]] filled with [[magnetorheological fluid]], which is controlled by a [[magnetic field]], usually using an [[electromagnet]].&lt;ref name="Innovative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writing.engr.psu.edu/me5984/poynor.pdf |title=Innovative Designs for Magneto-Rheological Dampers |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/Applications/PrimarySuspension/tabid/3329/Default.aspx Primary Suspension] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014053750/http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/Applications/PrimarySuspension/tabid/3329/Default.aspx |date=October 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/MRFluidTechnology/tabid/3318/Default.aspx MR Fluid Technology {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013211354/http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/MRFluidTechnology/tabid/3318/Default.aspx |date=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the damping characteristics of the [[shock absorber]] to be continuously controlled by varying the power of the [[electromagnet]]. Fluid [[viscosity]] increases within the damper as [[electromagnet]] intensity increases. This type of shock absorber has several applications, most notably in [[active suspension|semi-active]] [[vehicle suspension]]s which may adapt to road conditions, as they are monitored through sensors in the vehicle, and in [[prosthetic]] [[artificial limbs|limbs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/MRFluidTechnology/TechnologyCompared/tabid/3773/Default.aspx Technology Compared] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017011256/http://www.lord.com/Home/MagnetoRheologicalMRFluid/MRFluidTechnology/TechnologyCompared/tabid/3773/Default.aspx |date=October 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial applications==
Many applications have been proposed using magnetorheological (MR) dampers. While vehicle applications are the most common use of MR dampers, useful medical applications have risen as well, including implants and rehabilitation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carlson|first1=J.D.|last2=Matthis|first2=W.|last3=Toscano|first3=J.R.|title=Smart Prosthetics Based on MR Fluids|journal=Proc. 8th annual symposium On Smart Structure And Material SPIE|date=March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since MR dampers are not yet perfect, they are limited in terms of application. Disadvantages do exist when using a large scale MR damper, for example, particle settling within the carrier fluid may occur that inhibits some possible application.

===History===
The technology was originally developed by General Motors Delphi Automotive Division based in the USA and then developed further by BeijingWest Industries in China after BeijingWest Industries bought the technology from General Motors. BeijingWest Industries has subsequently introduced improvements including a redesigned ECU and the introduction of a dual coil system.

=== Automotive ===
These types of systems are available from OEMs for several vehicles, including the [[Acura MDX]], [[Audi TT]] and [[Audi R8|R8]], [[Buick Lucerne]], [[Cadillac ATS]], [[Cadillac CTS-V|CTS-V]], [[Cadillac DTS|DTS]], [[Cadillac XLR|XLR]], [[Cadillac SRX|SRX]], [[Cadillac STS|STS]], [[Chevrolet Corvette]], [[Chevrolet Camaro|Camaro ZL1]], [[Ferrari 458 Italia]], [[Ferrari 599GTB|599GTB]], [[Ferrari F12berlinetta|F12 Berlinetta]], [[Shelby GT350]], [[HSV Clubsport#E Series (2006–present)|Holden HSV E-Series]] and [[Lamborghini Huracán]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; These systems were produced by the [[Delphi Corporation]] and now by [[Beijing West Industries|BWI Group]] under the proprietary name [[MagneRide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delphi.com/news/pressReleases/pressReleases_2006/pr_2006_11_30_001/ |title=Press Release: Audi R8 Features Delphi's Revolutionary MagneRide Semi-Active Suspension |publisher=Delphi.com |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ferrari F12 Berlinetta news and pictures new Ferrari supercar |url=http://www.evo.co.uk/news/evonews/279502/new_ferrari_f12_berlinetta_revealed.html |publisher=[[Evo (magazine)|evo]] |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MillenWorks]] has also included them in several military vehicles including the [[MillenWorks Light Utility Vehicle]], and in retrofits to the [[US Army]] [[Stryker]] and [[HMMWV]] for testing by [[TARDEC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.millenworks.com/html/aboutus/news/Stryker_Test.pdf MillenWorks Active Damper Suspension System {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129094359/http://www.millenworks.com/html/aboutus/news/Stryker_Test.pdf |date=November 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA426496&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |title=A New Generation of Magneto-Rheological Fluid Dampers |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation===
MRF-based dampers are excellent candidates for stability augmentation of the lead-lag (in-plane bending) mode of rotor blades in helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;

==Control==
A magnetorheological damper is controlled by algorithms specifically designed for the purpose. There are plenty of alternatives, such as skyhook or groundhook algorithms.&lt;ref name="MRD"&gt;[http://www.magnetorheologicaldamper.com/controlling-semi-active-viscous-damper-with-groundhook-algorithm Magnetorheological Damper Laboratory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425064345/http://www.magnetorheologicaldamper.com/controlling-semi-active-viscous-damper-with-groundhook-algorithm |date=2012-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the algorithms is to control the [[yield point shear stress]] of the magnetorheological fluid with [[electric current]]. When the fluid is in the presence of an applied [[magnetic field]], the suspended metal particles align according to the [[field line]]s. [[Viscosity]] of the fluid increases according to the intensity of the magnetic field. When this occurs at the right instant, the properties of the damper change helps in attenuating an undesired shock or vibration. The relative efficacy of magnetorheological dampers to active and passive control strategies is usually comparable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=ALY|first=Aly Mousaad|author2=Richard Christenson|title=On the evaluation of the efficacy of a smart damper: a new equivalent energy-based probabilistic approach|journal=Smart Materials and Structures|year=2008|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0964-1726/17/4/045008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1951) ''The Bias of Communication''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 179-180.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Monopolies of knowledge''' arise when the [[ruling class]] maintains political power through control of key communications technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alexander John. (2006). ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.357.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that monopolies of knowledge gradually suppress new ways of thinking. Entrenched hierarchies become increasingly rigid and out of touch with social realities. Challenges to elite power are often likely to arise on the margins of society. The arts, for example, are often seen as a means of escape from the sterility of conformist thought.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1980) ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis'', introduced and edited by William Christian. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.xii-xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian economic historian [[Harold Innis]] developed the concept of monopolies of knowledge in his later writings on [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Monopolies of knowledge|communications theories]].&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Toronto: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this occurs in [[ancient Egypt]] where a complex writing system conferred a monopoly of knowledge on literate priests and scribes. Mastering the art of writing and reading required long periods of apprenticeship and instruction, confining knowledge to this powerful class.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (2007) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press, p.44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis's warnings about monopolies of knowledge take on particular urgency in the years immediately preceding his death in 1952. In his later writings, he argued that industrialization and mass media had led to the mechanization of a culture in which more personal forms of oral communication were radically devalued.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, pp.80-81.&lt;/ref&gt; "Reading is quicker than listening," Innis wrote in 1948. "The printing press and the radio address the world instead of the individual."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.191.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the concept ==

When discussing the monopolies of knowledge, Innis focuses much of his concern on the United States, where he feared that mass-circulation newspapers and magazines along with privately owned broadcasting networks had undermined independent thought and local cultures and rendered audiences passive in the face of what he calls the "vast monopolies of communication".&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''The Strategy of Culture''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James W. Carey]] notes that Innis worried about the centralized control of information and entertainment by advertising-driven media. "The very existence of a commodity such as 'information' and an institution called 'media' make each other necessary," Carey writes. "More people spend more time dependent on the journalist, the publisher, and the program director. Every week they wait for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [magazine]."&lt;ref&gt;Carey, James W. (1992) ''Communication As Culture: Essays on Media and Society'', p.168.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fashion his concept of monopolies of knowledge, Innis drew on several fields of study, including economics, history, communications and technology.

===Economics and the price system===

In his 1938 essay, ''The Penetrative Powers of the Price System'', Innis anticipates his later concept of monopolies of knowledge.  Although he does not precisely define what he means by the "price system", he does show how trade and technology shaped modern industrial economies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.217-218.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis suggests, for example, that the shift from coal and iron to oil and electricity had profound implications that no one in industrial societies could escape. He mentions the growth of cities with people living in large apartment buildings made possible by developments in electrical equipment on the one hand, and the dispersal of populations over wide metropolitan areas as a result of the automobile and paved roads, on the other.

The inhabitants of modern industrial societies even eat differently than their more rural forebears. "The demands of population in congested areas, under the direction of scientific work in nutrition," Innis writes, "have shifted from carbohydrates to vitamins or from wheat to dairy products, live-stock, fruits and vegetables."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1956) ''Essays in Canadian Economic History'', edited by Mary Q. Innis. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.263.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he adds, city dwellers are influenced by cheap, mass-circulation newspapers which peddle political stereotypes along with department store ads.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Essays), pp.266-267.&lt;/ref&gt; For Innis, the industrial economy monopolizes how people live, work, communicate and think.&lt;ref&gt;See, Kroker, Arthur. (1984) ''Technology and the Canadian Mind''. Montreal: New World Perspectives, pp.120-121.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and classical studies===

Innis's concept of monopolies of knowledge was also influenced by the scholar [[Solomon Gandz]] who published a lengthy paper in 1939 on the significance of the [[oral tradition]] in the development of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.353.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandz advanced the idea that the control of language in the oral tradition was grounded in religious institutions which ensured a civilization's continuity by preserving its traditions. At the same time, however, religious elites often shared their power with political elites who controlled the use of military force, thereby ensuring a civilization's success in conquering and holding territory.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp.358-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis incorporated these ideas in his concept of [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Time and space|time-biased and space-biased media]]. He argued that civilizations and empires flourished when there was a [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Balance.2C bias and empire|balance]] between time- and space-biased media.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; The triumph of one type of medium over the other, however, undermined stability demonstrating that unbalanced monopolies of knowledge could gradually lead to the decline and fall of civilizations and empires.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Innis's discussion of the priestly monopoly over writing that undermined the Egyptian empire. Innis (Empire), pp.44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis argued this was, in fact, happening to Western civilization which had become [[Harold Innis's communications theories#Western civilization in peril|dangerously unbalanced]] partly because of the monopoly of knowledge exercised by space-biased communications technologies such as the daily newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; For Innis, the newspaper reflected an obsession with what he termed "present-mindedness".&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.87.&lt;/ref&gt; Newspapers and the news agencies that served them could transmit large amounts of information over long distances, but this speed of transmission and the emphasis on immediacy obliterated continuity and memory. "Time," Innis wrote, "has been cut into pieces the length of a day's newspaper."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (1954) "Concept of Monopoly and Civilization." ''Explorations'', No. 3 quoted in Carey, p.163.&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of electronic media—radio and later, television—added more speed and immediacy contributing cumulatively to the erasure of cultural memory. Moreover, these space-biased media could be used by political elites to mobilize large populations—as in [[Nazi Germany]]—to support disastrous wars of conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p.410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of writing==

Innis placed special emphasis on monopolies of knowledge that are based on the control of written media. "We can conveniently divide the history of the West into the writing and printing periods," he writes in [[Empire and Communications#Writing.2C printing and speech|''Empire and Communications'']].&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===

"The sword and the pen worked together," Innis writes. "The written record signed, sealed, and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power and the extension of government. Small communities were written into large states and states were consolidated into empire." Innis adds that the monarchies of Egypt and Persia as well as the Roman empire "were essentially products of writing."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome's adoption of papyrus facilitated the [[Empire and Communications#Writing.2C empire and religion|spread of writing]] and the growth of bureaucratic administration needed to govern vast territories.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), pp.120-122.&lt;/ref&gt; The efficiency of the alphabet strengthened monopolies of knowledge in a variety of ancient empires.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p.77.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis warns about the power of writing to create mental "grooves" which determine "the channels of thought of readers and later writers."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printing and paper===

Innis believed that the [[printing press]] was a decisive invention in the history of the West. [[Lewis Mumford]] pointed out that printing was "a completely mechanical achievement...the type for all future instruments of reproduction: for the printed sheet...was the first completely standardized product."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, Lewis (1946) ''Technics and Civilization''. London: George Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd., p.135.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Innis, the printing press and the accompanying medium of paper ushered in not just the mechanization that would become characteristic of an industrial society based on mass production, but also the mechanization of knowledge itself. By that, Innis meant that printing led to the production of beliefs and practices that reinforced monopolies of knowledge characteristic of industrial culture.&lt;ref&gt;See, Innis, Harold (1980) ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis'' introduced and edited by William Christian, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this can be seen in the large-scale production of [[newsprint]] in the 19th century that had far-reaching effects. Newsprint fostered the development of big newspaper plants that needed larger numbers of readers to deliver to big advertisers such as [[department store]]s. Department stores themselves reflected new ways of marketing to rising numbers of city dwellers. To attract more readers, newspaper proprietors began to run [[comics]] and to rely on the "excitement and sensationalism" of foreign wars. Such coverage influenced British and American foreign policies, sometimes disastrously.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), pp.77-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis also warned that printed books could produce conformity of thought akin to the regimentation of workers in industrial factories.&lt;ref&gt;See Housser, Signe, ''Harold A. Innis and Michel Foucault: A Communications Perspective on Knowledge Construction''[http://ir.lib.sfu.ca/bitstream/1892/7718/1/b16625535.pdf], MA Thesis, Simon Fraser University, 1984, pp.66-67. Housser draws on ''The Idea File of Harold Adams Innis''. 2/42, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; He repeats the [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|Biblical commandment against worshiping graven images]], but suggests that in our unconscious society, this prohibition is not interpreted to apply to the printed word.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Idea File), 1/1, p.3. Innis writes: "Thou shalt not worship any graven image—not interpreted to mean the printed word or those words themselves.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Kuhns, societies dominated by print media regard only printed knowledge as "essentially valid." Textbook publishers exert a huge influence on education at all levels while schools and universities refuse to accept knowledge in other than printed forms. "The monopoly of knowledge protects its own with wary vigilance," Kuhns writes.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhns, William. (1971) ''The Post-Industrial Prophets: Interpretations of Technology''. New York: Weybright and Talley, pp.154-155.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in Mumford's words, with the advent of the printed book, learning "became book-learning."&lt;ref&gt;Mumford, p.136.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Levinson]] writes that "[l]iteracy probably constitutes the most significant monopoly of knowledge in human history."&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, Paul. (1997) ''The Soft Edge: A Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution''. New York: Routledge, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; He adds, however, that in open, democratic societies, public education systems are dedicated to breaking this monopoly by teaching students how to read and write, thereby giving them full access to printed knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, pp.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New media==

We can look at the [[Internet]] as being a factor in creating knowledge monopolies. Those who have the skills to use the technology have the power to choose what information is communicated. The significance of the Internet in the creation of these monopolies, in more recent years, has been somewhat diminished due to increased knowledge and awareness of how to use the technology. At the same time, the ever-increasing complexity of digital technologies strengthens monopolies of knowledge as the ''New York Times'' points out in a series which began on April 27, 2009, called ''The Digital Arms Race'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he Pentagon has commissioned military contractors to develop a highly classified replica of the Internet of the future. The goal is to simulate what it would take for adversaries to shut down the country’s power stations, telecommunications and aviation systems, or freeze the financial markets — in an effort to build better defenses against such attacks, as well as a new generation of online weapons.

Wherever new media arise, so too do monopolies of knowledge concerning how to use the technologies to reinforce the power and control of elite groups.

It was originally located at the "pink building" on the NYIT campus.

The lab was initially founded to produce a short high-quality feature film with the project name of ''[[The Works (film)|The Works]]''. The feature, which was never completed, was a 90-minute feature that was to be the first entirely computer-generated [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] movie. Production mainly focused around [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] and [[VAX]] machines.

Many of the original CGL team now form the elite of the CG and computer world with members going on to [[Silicon Graphics]], [[Microsoft]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[NVIDIA]] and others, including [[Pixar]] president and co-founder [[Ed Catmull]], Pixar co-founder and Microsoft graphics fellow [[Alvy Ray Smith]], Pixar co-founder{{fact|date=March 2018}} [[Ralph Guggenheim]], [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] chief scientist [[Lance Williams (graphics researcher)|Lance Williams]], [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] animator [[Hank Grebe]], [[Netscape]] and [[Silicon Graphics]] founder [[James H.

'''''On Weights and Measures''''' is a historical, lexical, [[metrological]], and geographical treatise compiled in 392 [[Common Era|CE]] in [[Salamis, Cyprus|Constantia]] by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (c. 315&amp;ndash;403). The greater part of the work is devoted to a discussion on ancient Greek and Roman [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|weights and measures]].

The composition was written at the request of a Persian priest, sent to Epiphanius by letter from the Roman emperor in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen A. Shaw, ''On Measures and Weights by Epiphanius'', National Mathematics Magazine 11.1 (October 1936: 3–7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 11 (note 3). The letter was apparently signed jointly by [[Valentinian II]], emperor of the West, and [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]], emperor of the East, as well as Theodosius' two sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although five fragments of an early Greek version are known to exist, with one entitled περὶ μέτρων καὶ στάθμων (''On Weights &amp; Measures''), added by a later hand,&lt;ref&gt;The Codex Parisinus Graecus 835, as noted by J.E. Dean (ed.), in ''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures: The Syriac Version'', (Chicago 1935), Introduction p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; this [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version is the only complete copy that has survived. Partial translations in Armenian and Georgian&lt;ref&gt;Found in the “Shatberd codex” MS. 1141, in the library of the ''Obshchestvo rasprostranenifa gramotnosti sredi gruzin'', Tiflis&lt;/ref&gt; are also known to exist. Its modern title belies its content, as the work also contains important historical anecdotes about people and places not written about elsewhere.

Two manuscripts of ''On Weights and Measures'', written in Syriac on parchment, are preserved at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]]. The older was found in [[Egypt]] and, according to the colophon, was written in the [[Seleucid era]], in "nine-hundred and sixty-[...]" (with the last digit effaced, meaning, that it was written between the years 649 CE–659 CE). The younger manuscript is designated "Or. Add. 14620".&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, [http://www.trismegistos.org/tm/detail.php?tm=115426 ''Catalogue of Syriac manuscripts in the British Museum''] 2 756 (pp. 717–718)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to attempt a modern publication of Epiphanius' work was [[Paul de Lagarde]] in 1880, who reconstructed the original Syriac text by exchanging it with Hebrew characters,&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Lagarde, ''Veteris Testamenti ab Origene recensiti fragmenta apud Syros servata quinque. Praemittitur Epiphanii de mensuris et ponderibus liber nunc primum integer et ipse syriacus'', Gootingae 1880&lt;/ref&gt; and who had earlier published excerpts from several of the Greek fragments treating on weights and measures in his ''Symmicta''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Largarde, ''Symmicta'' I, Göttingen 1877, pp. 210–225&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, a critical edition of the Greek text was published by E.D. Moutsoulas in ''Theologia''.&lt;ref&gt;E.D. Moutsoulas, ed., "Epiphanius of Salamis, Concerning Weights and Measures" (Introduction, Commentary, Text and Notes), ''Theologia'', 44 (1973), pp. 157&amp;ndash;198&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synopsis==
::&lt;small&gt;'''Part One'''&lt;/small&gt;
In folios [54b–55c], [[Hadrian]]'s journey and arrival in the East is dated "47 years after the destruction of Jerusalem."
*Translations
In folios [47a–49a]; [51d–52a]; [56d–57b] Epiphanius names four major translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]], made in the Greek tongue: the [[Septuagint|LXX]] made by the seventy-two translators, another by [[Aquila of Pontus]], one by [[Theodotion]], and yet another by [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]. A fifth Greek translation was discovered in wine jars in [[Jericho]], and a sixth in [[Nicopolis]] near Actium. Afterwards, [[Origen]] arranged six columns of the extant Greek translations and two of the Hebrew side by side, naming it the [[Hexapla]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 33&amp;ndash;34, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius expands his description of the translation of the seventy-two translators (known as the Septuagint) and how they were assigned thirty-six cells, two to each cell, on the Pharian island. Two translators translated the [[Book of Genesis]], another two the [[Book of Exodus]], another two the [[Book of Leviticus]], and so forth, until the entire 22 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible had all been translated into the Greek tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Excluding [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Song of Solomon]], which books had only later been added to the canon, according to Jewish tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; The seventy-two translators were drawn from the twelve tribes of Israel, six men to each tribe who were skilled in the Greek language.
 
In folios [49a–50a] Epiphanius gives a description of the canonical books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and translations made of the same. In his day, he notes that the Scroll of Ruth and the Book of Judges were joined together, and considered as one book. So, too, the [[Book of Ezra|Books of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] were joined, and considered as one book, as were First and Second [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] (''Paraleipomena'') considered as one book, as were the First and Second [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]] (''Book of First and Second Kingdoms'') considered as one book, and the First and Second [[Books of Kings|Kings]] (''Book of Third and Fourth Kingdoms'') considered as one book.&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Two'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Prominent figures
In spite of Epiphanius' interest in Jewish themes, his narrative often takes on a distorted and stereotypical view of [[Judaism]], based on the dogmas of his persuasion. Still, he is an invaluable source on the lives of people and places that figure highly in Jewish [[Oral tradition|lore]]. In folios [54a–55c]; [55c–55d] Epiphanius treats on the lives of two prominent persons who became [[proselytes]] to the Jewish religion; the one [[Aquila of Pontus|Aquila]] (known also as Onkelos) who was a relation of [[Hadrian]], and whom he made the overseer of Jerusalem's rebuilding around 115 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The other person of interest who is described by him is [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]], also known as ''Sūmkos'' ({{lang-he-n|'''סומכוס'''}}) in rabbinic literature.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Mishnah]] ''Eruvin'' 3:1; ''Baba Metzia'' 6:5; ''Ḥullin'' 5:3 in ''The Mishnah'' (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press, 1974; the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Eruvin'' 13b, ''Baba Bathra'' 73a, ''Baba Kamma'' 46a, ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus is mentioned as belonging originally to the [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] nation, and is said to have converted to Judaism during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius|Verus]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Epiphanius, Marcus Aurelius was also called Verus.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently underwent a second [[circumcision]]&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and became a disciple of [[Rabbi Meir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Eruvin'' 13b&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus belonged to the fifth generation (165&amp;ndash;200 [[Common Era|CE]]) of Rabbinical teachers referred to in the text of the [[Mishnah]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mishnah'' (ed. [[Herbert Danby]]), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, Appendix III, pp. 799&amp;ndash;800 {{ISBN|0 19 815402 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor [[Hadrian]] is said to have passed through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] while ''en route'' to Egypt, some 47 years after the destruction of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Three'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Weights and Measures
Folios [61d–73b] contain a treatise on the known weights and measures used in his day among the [[Jews|Hebrews]], the Greeks and the Romans. He states the equivalent weights for the ''[[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Dry measure|kab]]'' (''cab''),&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; ''kor'',&lt;ref&gt;A measure of capacity equal to 30 ''modii'' (seahs). v. ''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 12 (folio 45d). The same is defined in the Talmud (''Baba Bathra'' 86b, 105a) as equal to thirty ''seahs'', a capacity equal to about 395.533 cubic centimeters.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''lethekh'' ([[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Dry measure|Lethek]]), [[Homer (unit)|''homer'']], [[Bath (unit)|''bath'']], ''modius'' ([[Hebrew]]: ''seah'' = lit. "measure"),&lt;ref&gt;A measure of capacity equivalent to the volume of 144 medium-sized eggs (9.6 litres); Marcus Jastrow, ''Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature'' (2nd edition), Massachusetts 2006, s.v. '''מודיא''' p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mina (unit)|mina]]'' ([[Hebrew]]: ''maneh''),&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 60 (§ 51), 65; a weight in silver that was equal to 100 ''[[denarii|denaria]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In folios [62b–62c] Epiphanius distinguishes between "a handful" ({{Lang-he-n|'''מְלֹא כַף'''}}) in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a17.htm#12 I Kings 17:12] and "a handful" ({{Lang-he-n|'''מְלֹא חֹפֶן'''}}) in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0209.htm#8 Exodus 9:8] and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0316.htm#12 Leviticus 16:12]; in the former case it refers to only one handful, but in latter cases it refers to "a measure of two handfuls."&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Four'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Geography of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]
In folios [73b–75a] Epiphanius gives the names of several cities and places of renown, both in his time and in ancient times, such as: [[Mount Ararat]] (§ 61), Aṭaṭ (§ 62), or what is known as the "threshing floor of the thorn bush" ({{Lang-he-n|'''גרן האטד'''}}), and whose description echoes that of [[Rashi]]'s commentary on Genesis 50:10,&lt;ref&gt;Said to be a place about two miles from the Jordan River, called ''Beth-ḥagla'' (lit. "the place of the circuit").&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abarim]] (§ 63); [[Eben-Ezer|Aviʿazar]] (§ 68), or what is ''Eḇen haʿezer'' of [[I Samuel]] 4:1, said to be "fourteen [Roman] miles distant east and north of [[Eleutheropolis]], in a valley"; [[Carmel (biblical settlement)|Carmel]]{{nbsp}}(§ 77); [[Mount Carmel|Carmel]] of the sea (§ 78); [[Akko]] (§ 76);  [[Anathoth]] (§ 66); [[Azekah]] (§ 64) - a city in whose time was called Ḥ&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt;warta;&lt;ref&gt;R. Steven Notley &amp; [[Ze'ev Safrai]], in their book, "Eusebius, ''Onomasticon - The Place Names of Divine Scripture'' (Brill: Leiden 2005, p. 19, note 47), have noted: "According to his (Epiphanius') formulation, it would seem that he was of the opinion that Hiwarta, which means 'white' (''lavan''), is the translation of Azekah. About five kilometers to the southeast of Tell Zechariah is a high hill called Tell el-Beida, meaning in Arabic 'white'. In current maps, the site is named Tell Livnin, which means the hill of bricks (''livanim''), and it is to this that Eusebius (who also wrote about Azekah) most probably referred. 'Azekah' is not 'white', either in Hebrew or in Aramaic. ''Le-azek'' in Hebrew means to remove stones, and then the soil appears a bit paler. It therefore appears that Epiphanius, who was born in Beit Zedek, near [[Eleutheropolis]], identified Azekah with Tell el-Beida. Azekah is six kilometers from Eleutheropolis, and Tell Livnin is eight kilometers from there. Epiphanius adapted the new name to the identification by means of an etymological exegesis that has no linguistic basis. At any rate, no settlement existed on Tell Azekah in the Roman-Byzantine period. The early site moved from the high hill to the fields in the plain at the foot of the tell. It may possibly have moved as fr as Kh. el-Beida, although this is difficult to accept."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bethel]] (§ 73); [[Ophrah (Taybeh)|Ophrah]] (§ 67); [[Carthage]] (§ 79) - where the [[Canaanites]] had migrated from [[Phoenicia]] and who were called in his day ''Bizakanoi'' (scattered people); [[Petra|Rekem]] (§ 71), [[Jaffa]] (§ 75), [[Jerusalem]]{{nbsp}}(§ 74), ''et al.''

The regnal years of the Caesars as stated by Epiphanius differ slightly in some places from the extant Greek versions. With respect to events in Rome after the reign of [[Pertinax]], both Epiphanius and [[Jerome]] do not mention the ascension of [[Didius Julianus]] after the assassination of Pertinax, but write only that [[Septimius Severus|Severus]] succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Jerome]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm 2005 online edition]  (tertullian.org), year 193. Epiphanius, by his own admittance (''On Weights and Measures'', p. 66 [folio 71c]), was familiar with [[Eusebius]]' ''Chronicle'' from which Jerome had based his ''Chronicon'' and may have used it to construct his own chronologies.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been because they did not consider his 9-week reign, which he obtained through usurpation, to be legitimate. Similarly, Epiphanius does not mention the ascension of [[Aemilian]]. It can be adduced from Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' that Aemilian, who "caused a revolt in Moesia," was never officially confirmed by the Senate in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Jerome]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm 2005 online edition]  (tertullian.org), year 254&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius' method of recording the regnal years from Augustus to Hadrian, with his pinpoint recollection of the number of months and days to each reign, can be said to be accurate, based on [[Josephus]]' own testimony about himself, saying that he was aged 56  in the 13th year of the reign of Caesar [[Domitian]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (20.11.3)&lt;/ref&gt; and that he (Josephus) was born in the 1st year of Caesar [[Caligula|Gaius]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' § 1&lt;/ref&gt; Using Epiphanius' chronology, the years are indeed collected as 56. By comparison, the span of years in [[Suetonius]]' ''De vita Caesarum'' (Lives of the Caesars), which gives 14 years for Claudius and 15 years for Nero, the same time frame would span a period of some 58 years!&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Lives of the Caesars'' (the Loeb Classical Library series), vol. ii, book v, paragraph xlv&lt;/ref&gt;

It is sensitive to photons with an energy range of 25-80 keV. PoGOLite contains 217 [[phoswich detector]] cells (PDC) which are surrounded by a ring of side anticoincidence shield (SAS) detectors.

==PoGOLite Pathfinder mission==
The pathfinder instrument containing 61 PDCs and 30 SAS detectors was scheduled to be launched from the [[Esrange]] facility in northern [[Sweden]] during summer 2011. The flight was to be the first westward circumpolar balloon flight in the northern hemisphere in 20 years and was expected to take 17–25 days.

The main targets of the pathfinder experiment are the [[Crab Pulsar]] and the [[high-mass X-ray binary]] system [[Cygnus X-1]], which are two of the brightest objects in the energy range of PoGOLite.

The mission was launched at 1:57am Thursday 7 July 2011 (23h57 GMT Wednesday 6 July 2011) from [[Esrange]], Sweden. However, it was brought back down by 7:00am from an altitude of 35&amp;nbsp;km, because of a helium leak.&lt;ref&gt;SpaceDaily, [http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Giant_Swedish_space_balloon_fizzes_out_space_centre_999.html "Giant Swedish space balloon fizzes out: space centre"], '''AFP''', ''7 July 2011''&lt;/ref&gt; The payload landed near [[Nikkaluokta]] just before the mountains around the Sweden-Norway border where a landing would have caused more potential damage. The payload was returned to the Esrange site on 8 July 2011 after which initial tests showed only minor damage to the payload. A second attempt was scheduled for July 2012 but was cancelled because of bad weather. The mission's third and final attempt is scheduled for July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://okc.albanova.se/blog/bad-news-for-pogolite-once-again/ Bad news for PoGOLite once again, blog post at Oskar Klein Center by Mark Pearce]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6487">[[File:Point of view bias.jpg|thumb|Point of view. Two people are looking at the same object and interpreting it differently due to a different point of view]]
In [[philosophy]], a '''point of view''' is a specified or stated manner of consideration,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view"], Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  an attitude how one sees or thinks of something,&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view"] The American Heritage® Dictionary of Idioms by Christine Ammer. Houghton Mifflin Company. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; as in "from my personal point of view". This figurative usage of the expression as attested since 1760.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/point_of_view "Point of view."] Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 31 Aug. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In this meaning, the usage is synonymous with one of the meanings of the term '''perspective'''.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LMPS14 /&gt;

==Analysis==
Margarita Vázquez Campos and Antonio Manuel Liz Gutiérrez in their work, "The Notion of Point of View", give a comprehensive analysis of the structure of the concept. They point out that despite being crucial in many discourses, the notion has not been adequately analyzed, though some important works do exist.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"/&gt; They mention that early classical Greek philosophers, starting from [[Parmenides]] and [[Heraclitus]] discussed the relation between "appearance" and reality, i.e., how our points of view are connected with reality.&lt;ref&gt;Campos-Gutiérrez, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; They specifically point out [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s  ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''. They consider Wittgenstein's theory of "pictures" or "models" (Wittgenstein used the German word ''Bild'', which means both "picture" and "model") as an illustration of the relationship between points of view and reality.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "point of view" is highly multifunctional and ambiguous. Many things may be judged from certain personal, traditional or moral points of view (as in "the beauty is in the eye of the beholder"). Our knowledge about reality is often relative to a certain point of view.&lt;ref name="Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 2"/&gt;

Vázquez Campos and Manuel Liz Gutierrez suggested to analyse the concept of "point of view" using two approaches: one based on the concept of "[[propositional attitude]]s", the other on the concepts of "location" and "access".&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Liz, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propositional attitudes===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
The internal structure of a point of view may be analysed similarly to the concept of a  propositional attitude. A propositional attitude is an attitude, i.e., a mental state held by an agent toward a [[proposition]]. Examples of such attitudes are "to believe in something", "to desire something", "to guess something", "to remember something", etc. Vazques Campos and Gutierrez  suggest that points of view may be analyzed as structured sets of propositional attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Campos, Gutiérrez, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The authors draw on [[Christopher Peacocke]]'s ''Sense and Content''.&lt;ref name=LMPS14/&gt;

Within this approach one may carry out [[ontology|ontological]] classification of various distinctions, such as individual vs. collective points of view, personal vs. non-personal,  non-conceptual vs. conceptual, etc.&lt;ref name=LMPS14&gt;Manuel Liz &amp; Margarita Vázquez, [https://www.academia.edu/913996/C2._Cognitive_Science_Two_approaches_to_the_notion_of_Point_of_View_Manuel_Liz_and_Margarita_V%C3%A1zquez "Two approaches to the notion of Point of View"], extended abstract for: [http://www.clmps2011.org/fileadmin/user_upload/VolumeOfAbstracts_FINAL.pdf ''14th Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920152028/http://www.clmps2011.org/fileadmin/user_upload/VolumeOfAbstracts_FINAL.pdf |date=2015-09-20 }}, July 19–26, 2011 (retrieved August 31, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location and access===
{{expand section|date=August 2015}}
{{See also|Privileged access|Emic and etic}}
Whereas propositional attitudes approach is to analyze points of view internally, the "location/access" approach analyzes points of view externally, by their role. The term "access" refers to the statement of Liz Gutierrez that "points of views, or perspectives, are ways of having access to the world and to ourselves", and the term "location" is in reference to the provided quotation of [[Jon Moline]] that points of view are "ways of viewing things and events from certain locations". Moline rejects the notion that points of view are reducible to some rules based on some theories, maxims or dogmas. Moline considers the concept of "location" in two ways: in a direct way as a vantage point, and in an extended way, the way how a given vantage point provides a perspective, i.e., influences the perception.&lt;ref&gt;Moline, Jon, "On Points of View", American Philosophical Quarterly, 1968, vol. 5, 191–298. (as cited by Manuel Liz)&lt;/ref&gt;

This approach may address [[epistemology|epistemological]] issues, such as [[relativism]], existence of the absolute point of view, compatibility of points of view (including "[[faultless disagreement]]"), possibility of a point of view without a bearer, etc.&lt;ref name=LMPS14/&gt;

'''Prestressed concrete''' is a form of [[concrete]] used in construction that, during its building phases (before to load any weight, including its own), is substantially "prestressed" ([[Compression forces|compressed]]) in the areas which will be subjected to traction forces when on service, in order to prevent any areas subjected to traction force when the structure will be placed in opera (and subjected to the service loads), by summatory of opposite forces - ''pre compression action against tension force produced by own weight and service loads'' - planned for avoid result in traction.&lt;ref name="LinTY"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lin|first1=T.Y.|last2=Burns|first2=Ned H.|title=Design of Prestressed Concrete Structures|date=1981|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York, US|isbn=0 471 01898 8|edition=Third|url=http://www.slideshare.net/ankitd1094/design-of-prestressed-concrete-structures-tylin-50801288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FIB31"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Federation Internationale du Beton|title=fib Bulletin 31: Post-tensioning in Buildings|date=February 2005|publisher=FIB|isbn=978 2 88394 071 0|url=http://www.civil.ist.utl.pt/~cristina/EBAP/book_63505_fib31.pdf|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–5}} &lt;ref name="ACI-CT13"&gt;{{cite web|last1=American Concrete Institute|title=CT-13: ACI Concrete Terminology|url=https://www.concrete.org/topicsinconcrete/topicdetail/prestressed|website=American Concrete Institute|publisher=ACI|accessdate=25 August 2016|location=Farmington Hills, Michigan US}} Post-tensioned concreted is "structural concrete in which internal stresses have been introduced to reduce potential tensile stresses in the concrete resulting from loads."&lt;/ref&gt;

This compression is produced by the [[Tension (physics)|tensioning]] of high-strength "tendons" located within or adjacent to the concrete volume and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service.&lt;ref name="Warner-1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warner|first1=R. F.|last2=Rangan|first2=B. V.|last3=Hall|first3=A. S.|last4=Faulkes|first4=K.

This can result in improved structural capacity and/or [[Serviceability (structure)|serviceability]] compared with conventionally [[reinforced concrete]] in many situations.&lt;ref name="FIB31"/&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warner|first1=R.

A.|title=Prestressed Concrete|date=1988|publisher=Longman Cheshire|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=0 582 71225 4|pages=1–13|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;In a prestressed concrete member, the internal stresses are introduced in a planned manner so that the stresses resulting from the superimposed loads are counteracted to the desired degree.

Prestressed concrete is used in a wide range of building and civil structures where its improved performance can allow for longer [[Span (engineering)|spans]], reduced structural thicknesses, and material savings compared with simple [[reinforced concrete]]. Typical applications include [[Tower block|high-rise buildings]], residential slabs, [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation systems]], [[bridge]] and [[dam]] structures, [[silo]]s and [[water tanks|tanks]], [[Hardstand|industrial pavements]] and [[Containment building|nuclear containment structures]].&lt;ref name="PTI-Apps"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Post-Tensioning Institute|title=Post-Tensioning Manual|date=2006|publisher=PTI|location=Phoenix, AZ US|isbn=0 9778752 0 2|pages=5–54|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First used in the late-nineteenth century,&lt;ref name=LinTY /&gt; prestressed concrete has developed beyond [[Prestressed concrete#Pre-tensioned concrete|pre-tensioning]] to include [[Prestressed concrete#Post-tensioned concrete|post-tensioning]], which occurs after the concrete is cast. Tensioning systems may be classed as either ''monostrand'', where each tendon's strand or wire is stressed individually, or ''multi-strand'', where all strands or wires in a tendon are stressed simultaneously.&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt; Tendons may be located either ''within'' the concrete volume (internal prestressing) or wholly ''outside'' of it (external prestressing). While pre-tensioned concrete uses tendons directly bonded to the concrete, post-tensioned concrete can use either [[Prestressed concrete#Bonded post-tensioned concrete|''bonded'']] or [[Prestressed concrete#Unbonded post-tensioned concrete|''unbonded'']] tendons.

==Prestressed concrete by "Pre-tensioned tendons"==
[[File:Sofortiger-Verbund-en.png|left|thumb|Pre-tensioning process]]
[[File:AASHTO Girder.jpg|thumb|Pre-tensioned bridge girder in precasting bed. Note single-strand tendons exiting through the [[formwork]]]]
Pre-tensioned concrete is a variant of prestressed concrete where the tendons are tensioned ''prior'' to the concrete being cast.&lt;ref name="LinTY" /&gt;{{rp|25}} The concrete bonds to the tendons as it [[Concrete#Curing|cures]], following which the end-anchoring of the tendons is released, and the tendon [[Tension (physics)|tension forces]] are transferred to the concrete as compression by [[static friction]].&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt;{{rp|7}}

Pre-tensioning is a common [[prefabrication]] technique, where the resulting concrete element is manufactured remotely from the final structure location and transported to site once cured. It requires strong, stable end-anchorage points between which the tendons are stretched. These anchorages form the ends of a "casting bed" which may be many times the length of the concrete element being fabricated. This allows multiple elements to be constructed end-on-end in the one pre-tensioning operation, allowing significant productivity benefits and economies of scale to be realised for this method of construction.&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tokyo Rope Mfg Co Ltd|title=CFCC Pre-tensioning Manual|url=http://www.maine.gov/mdot/contractors/projects/2014/019283.00-kittery/pm019283.00.pdf|website=MaineDOT|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of bond (or [[adhesion]]) achievable between the freshly set concrete and the surface of the tendons is critical to the pre-tensioning process, as it determines when the tendon anchorages can be safely released. Higher bond strength in early-age concrete allows more economical fabrication as it speeds production. To promote this, pre-tensioned tendons are usually composed of isolated ''single'' wires or strands, as this provides a greater [[surface area]] for bond action than bundled strand tendons.&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt;

[[File:SpannbetonFertigdecke Montage.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-tensioned hollow-core plank being placed]]
Unlike those of post-tensioned concrete, the tendons of pre-tensioned concrete elements generally form straight lines between end-anchorages. Where "profiled" or "harped" tendons&lt;ref&gt;"Tendons having one or more deviations from a straight line, either vertically or horizontally, between the ends of the structure"&lt;/ref&gt; are required, one or more intermediate ''deviators'' are located between the ends of the tendon to hold the tendon to the desired non-linear alignment during tensioning.&lt;ref name="LinTY" /&gt;{{rp|68–73}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Such deviators usually act against substantial forces, and hence require a robust casting bed foundation system. Straight tendons are typically used in "linear" precast elements such as shallow beams, hollow-core planks and slabs, whereas profiled tendons are more commonly found in deeper precast bridge beams and girders.

Pre-tensioned concrete is most commonly used for the fabrication of structural [[Beam (structure)|beams]], [[Concrete slab|floor slabs]], [[hollow-core slab|hollow-core planks]], [[balcony|balconies]], [[lintel]]s, driven [[Deep foundation|piles]], [[water tanks]] and concrete [[Pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipes]].

==Prestressed concrete by "Post-tensioned tendons"==
[[File:Post-Tensioned Concrete.svg|thumb|right]]
[[File:Stressing_anchorage.jpg|thumb|Post-tensioned tendon anchorage. Four-piece "lock-off" wedges are visible holding each strand]]
Post-tensioned concrete is a variant of prestressed concrete where the tendons are tensioned ''after'' the surrounding concrete structure has been cast.&lt;ref name="LinTY" /&gt;{{rp|25}}

The tendons are not placed in direct contact with the concrete, but are encapsulated within a protective sleeve or duct which is either cast into the concrete structure or placed adjacent to it. At each end of a tendon is an anchorage assembly firmly fixed to the surrounding concrete. Once the concrete has been cast and set, the tendons are tensioned ("stressed") by pulling the tendon ends through the anchorages while pressing against the concrete. The large forces required to tension the tendons result in a significant permanent compression being applied to the concrete once the tendon is "locked-off" at the anchorage.&lt;ref name="LinTY"/&gt;{{rp|25}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB"/&gt;{{rp|7}} The method of locking the tendon-ends to the anchorage is dependent upon the tendon composition, with the most common systems being "button-head" anchoring (for wire tendons), [[Wedge (mechanical device)|split-wedge]] anchoring (for strand tendons), and [[Screw thread|threaded]] anchoring (for bar tendons).&lt;ref name="LinTY"/&gt;{{rp|79–84}}

[[File:Go Between Bridge construction (2).jpg|thumb|left|Balanced-cantilever bridge under construction. Each added segment is supported by post-tensioned tendons]]
Tendon encapsulation systems are constructed from plastic or [[galvanised]] steel materials, and are classified into two main types: those where the tendon element is subsequently bonded to the surrounding concrete by internal [[grout]]ing of the duct after stressing (''bonded'' post-tensioning); and those where the tendon element is permanently ''de''bonded from the surrounding concrete, usually by means of a [[Grease (lubricant)|greased]] sheath over the tendon strands (''unbonded'' post-tensioning).&lt;ref name="LinTY"/&gt;{{rp|26}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB"/&gt;{{rp|10}}

Casting the tendon ducts/sleeves into the concrete before any tensioning occurs allows them to be readily "profiled" to any desired shape including incorporating vertical and/or horizontal [[curvature]]. When the tendons are tensioned, this profiling results in [[Reaction (physics)|reaction]] forces being imparted onto the hardened concrete, and these can be beneficially used to counter any loadings subsequently applied to the structure.&lt;ref name="FIB31"/&gt;{{rp|5–6}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB"/&gt;{{rp|48}}{{rp|9–10}}

===Bonded post-tensioning===

Bonded post-tensioning has prestressing tendons permanently bonded to the surrounding concrete by the ''[[in situ]]'' [[grout]]ing of their encapsulating ducting following tendon tensioning. This grouting is undertaken for three main purposes: to protect the tendons against [[corrosion]]; to permanently "lock-in" the tendon pre-tension, thereby removing the long-term reliance upon the end-anchorage systems; and to improve certain [[Structural analysis|structural behaviors]] of the final concrete structure.&lt;ref name="Aalami"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aalami|first1=Bijan O.|title=Unbonded and bonded post-tensioning systems in building construction|journal=PTI Technical Notes|date=5 September 1994|issue=5|url=http://www.post-tensioning.org/Uploads/technote5.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2016|publisher=Post-Tensioning Institute|location=Phoenix, Arizona US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bonded post-tensioning characteristically uses tendons each comprising ''bundles'' of elements (e.g. strands or wires) placed inside a single tendon duct, with the exception of bars which are mostly used unbundled. This bundling make for more efficient tendon installation and grouting processes, since each complete tendon requires only one set of end-anchorages and one grouting operation. Ducting is fabricated from a durable and corrosion-resistant material such as plastic (e.g. [[polyethylene]]) or [[galvanised]] steel, and can be either round or rectangular/oval in cross-section.&lt;ref name="FIB31"/&gt;{{rp|7}} The tendon sizes used are highly dependent upon the application, ranging from [[building]] works typically using between 2-strands and 6-strands per tendon, to specialised [[dam]] works using up to 91-strands per tendon.

Fabrication of bonded tendons is generally undertaken on-site, commencing with the fitting of end-anchorages to [[formwork]], placing the tendon ducting to the required curvature profiles, and reeving (or threading) the strands or wires through the ducting. Following concreting and tensioning, the ducts are [[pressure grouting|pressure-grouted]] and the tendon stressing-ends sealed against [[corrosion]].&lt;ref name="WarnerB"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

===Unbonded post-tensioning===
[[File:Post-Tensioning-Cables-2.jpg|thumb|Unbonded slab post-tensioning. Installed strands and edge-anchors are visible, along with prefabricated coiled strands for the next pour]]
Unbonded post-tensioning differs from bonded post-tensioning by allowing the tendons permanent freedom of [[Geometric terms of location|longitudinal]] movement relative to the concrete. This is most commonly achieved by encasing each individual tendon element within a plastic sheathing filled with a [[corrosion]]-inhibiting [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]], usually [[lithium]] based. Anchorages at each end of the tendon transfer the [[Tension (physics)|tensioning]] force to the concrete, and are required to reliably perform this role for the life of the structure.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

Unbonded post-tensioning can take the form of:
* Individual strand tendons placed directly into the concreted structure (e.g. buildings, ground slabs), or
* Bundled strands, individually greased-and-sheathed, forming a single tendon within an encapsulating duct that is placed either within or adjacent to the concrete (e.g. restressable anchors, external post-tensioning)

[[File:Post-Tensioning-Cables-8.jpg|thumb|Unbonded slab post-tensioning. End-view of slab after stripping, showing individual strands and stressing-anchor recesses]]
For individual strand tendons, no additional tendon ducting is used and no post-stressing grouting operation is required, unlike for bonded post-tensioning. Permanent corrosion protection of the strands is provided by the combined layers of grease, plastic sheathing, and surrounding concrete. Where strands are bundled to form a single unbonded tendon, an enveloping duct of plastic or galvanised steel is used and its interior free-spaces grouted after stressing. In this way, additional corrosion protection is provided via the grease, plastic sheathing, grout, external sheathing, and surrounding concrete layers.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

Individually greased-and-sheathed tendons are mostly fabricated off-site by an [[extrusion]] process. The bare steel strand is fed into a greasing chamber and then passed to an extrusion unit where molten plastic forms a continuous outer coating. Finished strands can be cut-to-length and fitted with "dead-end" anchor assemblies as required for the project.

===Comparison between bonded and unbonded post-tensioning===
Both bonded and unbonded post-tensioning technologies are widely used around the world, and the choice of system to use is often dictated by regional preferences, contractor experience, or the availability of alternative systems. Either one is capable of delivering code-compliant, durable structures meeting the structural strength and serviceability requirements of the designer.&lt;ref name="Aalami" /&gt;{{rp|2}}

The benefits that bonded post-tensioning can offer over unbonded systems are:
* Reduced reliance on end-anchorage integrity&lt;br /&gt;Following tensioning and grouting, bonded tendons are connected to the surrounding concrete along their full length by high-strength [[grout]]. Once cured, this grout can transfer the full tendon tension force to the concrete within a very short distance (approximately 1 metre). As a result, any inadvertent severing of the tendon or failure of an end anchorage has only a very localised impact on tendon performance, and almost never results in tendon ejection from the anchorage.&lt;ref name="FIB31"/&gt;{{rp|18}}&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|7}}
* Increased [[Strength of materials|ultimate strength]] in [[Bending|flexure]]&lt;br /&gt;With bonded post-tensioning, any [[Bending|flexure]] of the structure gets directly resisted by tendon [[Deformation (engineering)|strains]] at that same location (i.e. no strain re-distribution occurs). This results in significantly higher [[Tension (physics)|tensile]] strains in the tendons than if they were unbonded, allowing their full [[Yield (engineering)|yield strength]] to be realised, and producing a higher ultimate load capacity.&lt;ref name="FIB31"/&gt;{{rp|16–17}}&lt;ref name="WarnerB" /&gt;{{rp|10}}
* Improved crack-control&lt;br /&gt;In the presence of concrete [[Properties of concrete#Cracking|cracking]], bonded tendons respond similarly to conventional reinforcement (rebar). With the tendons fixed to the concrete at each side of the crack, greater crack-expansion resistance is offered than with unbonded tendons, allowing many design codes to specify reduced reinforcement requirements for bonded post-tensioning.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="Adapt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aalami|first1=Bijan O.|title=Nonprestresed Bonded Reinforcement in Post-Tensioned Building Design|journal=ADAPT Technical Publication|date=February 2001|issue=P2-01|url=http://www.adaptsoft.com/resources/ADAPT_P201_Nonpre-Bonded-PT-Bldg-Dsgnr.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}
* Improved fire performance&lt;br /&gt;The absence of strain redistribution in bonded tendons may limit the impact that any localised overheating has on the overall structure. As a result, bonded structures may display a higher capacity to resist fire conditions than unbonded ones.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailey|first1=Colin G.|last2=Ellobody|first2=Ehab|title=Comparison of unbonded and bonded post-tensioned concrete slabs under fire conditions|journal=The Structural Engineer|date=2009|volume=87|issue=19|url=https://www.istructe.org/journal/volumes/volume-87-(published-in-2009)/issues/issue-19/articles/comparison-of-unbonded-and-bonded-posttensioned-co|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits that unbonded post-tensioning can offer over bonded systems are:
* Ability to be [[prefabricated]]&lt;br /&gt;Unbonded tendons can be readily prefabricated off-site complete with end-anchorages, facilitating faster installation during construction. Additional [[lead time]] may need to be allowed for this fabrication process. 
* Improved site [[productivity]]&lt;br /&gt;The elimination of the post-stressing grouting process required in bonded structures improves the site-labour productivity of unbonded post-tensioning.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Improved installation [[flexibility]]&lt;br /&gt;Unbonded single-strand tendons have greater handling flexibility than bonded ducting during installation, allowing them a greater ability to be deviated around service penetrations or obstructions.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|5}}
* Reduced [[concrete cover]]&lt;br /&gt;Unbonded tendons may allow some reduction in concrete element thickness, as their smaller size and increased corrosion protection compared to ducted tendons may allow them to be placed closer to the concrete surface.&lt;ref name=FIB31/&gt;{{rp|8}}
* Simpler replacement and/or adjustment&lt;br /&gt;Being permanently isolated from the concrete, unbonded tendons are able to be readily de-stressed, re-stressed and/or replaced should they become damaged or need their force levels to be modified in-service.&lt;ref name="Aalami"/&gt;{{rp|6}}
* Superior overload performance&lt;br /&gt;Although having a lower ultimate strength than bonded tendons, unbonded tendons' ability to redistribute strains over their full length can give them superior pre-collapse [[ductility]]. In extremes, unbonded tendons can resort to a ''[[catenary]]''-type action instead of pure flexure, allowing significantly greater [[Deformation (engineering)|deformation]] before structural failure.&lt;ref name="Bondy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bondy|first1=Kenneth B.|title=Two way post-tensioned slabs with bonded tendons|journal=PTI Journal|date=December 2012|volume=8|issue=2|page=44|url=http://www.kenbondy.com/images/ProfessionalArticles/130129-Journal%20Reprint-Bondy-Two-Way%20PT%20Slabs%20with%20Bonded%20Tendons.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2016|publisher=Post-Tensioning Institute|location=US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tendon durability and corrosion protection==
Long-term durability is an essential requirement for prestressed concrete given its significance as a ubiquitous, modern construction material.
Research on the durability performance of in-service prestressed structures has been undertaken since the 1960s,&lt;ref name="Szilard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szilard|first1=Rudolph|title=Survey on the Durability of Prestressed Concrete Structures|journal=PCI Journal|date=October 1969|pages=62–73|url=http://www.pci.org/uploadedFiles/Siteroot/Publications/PCI_Journal/1969/DOI_Articles/jl-69-october-7.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-corrosion technologies for tendon protection have been continually improved since the earliest systems were developed.&lt;ref name="Podolny"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Podolny|first1=Walter|title=Corrosion of Prestressing Steels and its Mitigation|journal=PCI Journal|date=September 1992|pages=34–55|url=http://www.pci.org/uploadedFiles/Siteroot/Publications/PCI_Journal/1992/DOI_Articles/jl-92-september-october-4.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The durability of prestressed concrete is principally determined by the level of corrosion protection provided to any high-strength steel elements within the prestressing tendons. Also critical is the protection afforded to the end-anchorage assemblies of unbonded tendons or cable-stay systems, as the anchorages of both of these are required to retain the prestressing forces permanently. Failure of any of these components can result in the release of prestressing forces, or the physical rupture of stressing tendons.

Modern prestressing systems deliver long-term durability by addressing the following areas:
* '''Tendon grouting''' (bonded tendons)&lt;br/&gt;Bonded tendons consist of bundled high-strength (steel) strands placed inside ducts located within the surrounding concrete. To ensure full protection to these strands, the ducts must be pressure-filled with a [[Corrosion inhibitor|corrosion-inhibiting]] grout, without leaving any voids, following strand-tensioning.
* '''Tendon coating''' (unbonded tendons)&lt;br/&gt;Unbonded tendons comprise individual high-strength strands coated in an anti-corrosion grease or wax, and fitted with a durable plastic-based full-length sleeve or sheath. The sleeving is required to be undamaged over the tendon length, and it must extend fully into the anchorage fittings at each end of the tendon.
* '''Double-layer encapsulation'''&lt;br/&gt;Prestressing tendons requiring permanent [[Deformation monitoring|monitoring]] and/or force adjustment, such as [[Cable-stayed bridge|stay-cables]] and re-stressable dam anchors, will typically employ double-layer corrosion protection. Such tendons are composed of individual strands, grease-coated and sleeved, collected into a strand-bundle and placed inside encapsulating [[polyethylene]] outer ducting. The remaining void space within the duct is pressure-grouted, providing a multi-layer polythene-grout-plastic-grease protection barrier system for each strand.
* '''Anchorage protection'''&lt;br/&gt;In all post-tensioned installations, protection of the end-anchorages against corrosion is essential, and critically so for unbonded systems

Several durability-related historical events are listed below:
* Ynys-y-Gwas bridge, West Glamorgan, Wales 1985&lt;br/&gt;A single-span, [[Segmental bridge|precast-segmental]] structure constructed in 1953 with longitudinal and transverse post-tensioning. [[Corrosion]] attacked the under-protected tendons where they crossed the ''in-situ'' joints between the segments, leading to sudden collapse.&lt;ref name="Podolny"/&gt;{{rp|40}}
* Scheldt River bridge, Melle, Belgium 1991&lt;br/&gt;A 3-span prestressed [[Cantilever bridge|cantilever structure]] constructed in the 1950s. Inadequate [[concrete cover]] in the side [[abutment]]s resulted in tie-down cable [[corrosion]], leading to a progressive failure of the main bridge span and the death of one person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Schutter|first1=Geert|title=Damage to Concrete Structures|date=10 May 2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780415603881|pages=31–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38LLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=melle+bridge+belgium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8R0k2JCgZa&amp;sig=VVGb0Cp8K4cFa5WAW9Q2Ogr6hVs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj3ebV0_zOAhXGHZQKHcJ_B-EQ6AEIKzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=melle%20bridge%20belgium&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Highways Agency|UK Highways Agency]] 1992&lt;br/&gt;Following discovery of tendon corrosion in several bridges in England, the Highways Agency issued a moratorium on the construction of new internally- grouted post-tensioned bridges and embarked on a 5-year programme of inspections on its existing post-tensioned bridge stock. The moratorium was lifted in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ryall|first1=M.

==Applications==
Prestressed concrete is a highly versatile construction material as a result of it being an almost ideal combination of its two main constituents: high-strength steel, pre-stretched to allow its full strength to be easily realised; and modern concrete, pre-compressed to minimise cracking under tensile forces.&lt;ref name="LinTY"/&gt;{{rp|12}} Its wide range of application is reflected in its incorporation into the major design codes covering most areas of structural and civil engineering, including buildings, bridges, dams, foundations, pavements, piles, stadiums, silos, and tanks.&lt;ref name="PTI-Apps"/&gt;

===Building structures===
Building structures are typically required to satisfy a broad range of structural, aesthetic and economic requirements. Significant among these include: a minimum number of (intrusive) supporting walls or columns; low structural thickness (depth), allowing space for services, or for additional floors in high-rise construction; fast construction cycles, especially for multi-storey buildings; and a low cost-per-unit-area, to maximise the building owner's return on investment.

The prestressing of concrete allows "load-balancing" forces to be introduced into the structure to counter the loadings which will apply in-service. This provides many benefits to building structures:
* Longer spans for the same structural depth&lt;br/&gt;Load-balancing results in lower in-service deflections, which allows spans to be increased (and the number of supports reduced) without adding to structural depth.
* Reduced structural thickness&lt;br /&gt;For a given span, lower in-service deflections allows thinner structural sections to be used, in turn resulting in lower floor-to-floor heights, or more room for building services.
* Faster stripping time&lt;br/&gt;Typically, prestressed concrete building elements are fully stressed and self-supporting within five days. At this point they can have their formwork stripped and re-deployed to the next section of the building, accelerating construction "cycle-times".
* Reduced material costs&lt;br /&gt;The combination of reduced structural thickness, reduced conventional reinforcement quantities, and fast construction often results in prestressed concrete showing significant cost benefits in building structures compared to alternative structural materials.

====Dams====
Concrete dams have used prestressing to counter uplift and increase their overall stability since the mid 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roemermann|first1=A. C.|title=Prestressed Concrete Dams: 1936-1964|journal=PCI Journal|date=February 1965|pages=76–88|url=http://www.pci.org/uploadedFiles/Siteroot/Publications/PCI_Journal/1965/DOI_Articles/JL-65-FEBRUARY-4.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=E.

Most commonly, dam prestressing takes the form of post-tensioned anchors drilled into the dam's concrete structure and/or the underlying rock strata. Such anchors typically comprise tendons of high-tensile bundled steel strands or individual threaded bars. Tendons are grouted to the concrete or rock at their far (internal) end, and have a significant "de-bonded" free-length at their external end which allows the tendon to stretch during tensioning. Tendons may be full-length bonded to the surrounding concrete or rock once tensioned, or (more commonly) have strands permanently encapsulated in corrosion-inhibiting grease over the free-length to permit long-term load monitoring and re-stressability.&lt;ref name="Cavill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavill|first1=Brian|title=Very High capacity Ground Anchors Used in Strengthening Concrete Gravity Dams|journal=Conference Proceedings|date=20 March 1997|page=262|publisher=Institution of Civil Engineers|location=London UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Silos and tanks====
Circular storage structures such as silos and tanks can use prestressing forces to directly resist the outward pressures generated by stored liquids or bulk-solids.
Horizontally curved tendons are installed within the concrete wall to form a series of "hoops" spaced vertically up the structure. When tensioned, these tendons exert both axial (compressive) and radial (inward) forces onto the structure, which can  used to directly oppose the subsequent storage loadings. If the magnitude of the prestress is designed to always exceed the tensile stresses produced by the loadings, a permanent residual compression will exist in the wall concrete, assisting in maintaining a watertight, crack-free structure under all storage conditions.&lt;ref name="Priestley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Priestley|first1=M. J. N.|title=Analysis and Design of Prestressed Circular Concrete Storage Tanks|journal=PCI Journal|date=July 1985|pages=64–85|url=http://www.pci.org/uploadedFiles/Siteroot/Publications/PCI_Journal/1985/DOI_Articles/jl-85-july-august-5.pdf|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghali"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ghali|first1=Amin|title=Circular Storage Tasnks and Silos|date=12 May 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781466571044|pages=149–165|edition=Third|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYjNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA217&amp;lpg=PA217&amp;dq=silo+tank+design+prestressed+concrete&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BQ7EuHISz5&amp;sig=-QOrRYmZar6-pPrDz9R2S_JyDX4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXiY_WivfOAhVCjJQKHaabCXQQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=silo%20tank%20design%20prestressed%20concrete&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Circular Prestressing|url=http://theconstructor.org/concrete/prestressed/circular-prestressing/1521/|website=theconstructor.org|publisher=The Constructor.org|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=R.

====Nuclear and blast-containment structures====
Prestressed concrete is long-established as a reliable construction material for high-pressure containment structures such as nuclear reactor vessels and containment buildings, and petrochemical tank blast-containment walls. Using prestressing to place such structures into an initial state of bi-axial or tri-axial compression increases their resistance to concrete cracking and leakage, while providing a proof-loaded, redundant and monitorable pressure-containment system.&lt;ref name="Raju"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raju|first1=Krishna|title=Prestressed Concrete|publisher=Tata McGraw Hill|location=New Delhi|isbn=0 07 063444 0|edition=Fourth|url=http://clghub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Prestressed-Concrete.pdf|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|585–594}}&lt;ref name="Bangash"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bangash|first1=M.

Nuclear reactor and containment vessels will commonly employ separate sets of post tensioned tendons curved horizontally or vertically to completely envelop the reactor core, while blast containment walls for LNG tanks and similar will normally utilise layers of horizontally-curved hoop tendons for containment in combination with vertically looped tendons for axial wall prestressing.

====Hardstands and pavements====
Heavily loaded concrete ground-slabs and pavements can be sensitive to cracking and subsequent traffic-driven deterioration. As a result, prestressed concrete is regularly used in such structures as its pre-compression provides the concrete with the ability to resist the crack-inducing tensile stresses generated by in-service loading. This crack-resistance also allows individual slab sections to be constructed in larger pours than for conventionally reinforced concrete, resulting in wider joint spacings, reduced jointing costs and less long-term joint maintenance issues.&lt;ref name="Raju"/&gt;{{rp|594–598}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Post-Tensioned Slabs on Grade|url=http://www.concreteconstruction.net/how-to/building-post-tensioned-slabs-on-grade_o|website=www.concreteconstruction.net|publisher=Concrete Construction|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initial works have also been successfully conducted on the use of precast prestressed concrete for road pavements, where the speed and quality of the construction has been noted as being beneficial for this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Merritt|first1=David|last2=Rogers|first2=Richard|last3=Rasmussen|first3=Robert|title=Construction of a Precast Prestressed Concrete Pavement Demonstration  Project on Interstate 57 near Sikeston, Missouri|date=March 2008|publisher=US DOT Federal Highway Administration|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/concrete/pubs/hif08009/hif08009.pdf|accessdate=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design agencies and regulations==
Worldwide, many professional organizations exist to promote best practice in the design and construction of prestressed concrete structures. In the United States, such organizations include the [[Post-Tensioning Institute]] (PTI) and the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute ([https://web.archive.org/web/19961220081344/http://www.pci.org/ PCI]). Similar bodies include the Canadian Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute ([http://www.cpci.ca/ CPCI]), the UK's [http://www.posttensioning.co.uk/ Post-Tensioning Association], the [http://www.ptia.org.au/ Post Tensioning Institute of Australia] and the [http://www.sapta.co.za/ South African Post Tensioning Association]. Europe has similar country-based associations and institutions.

It is important to note that these organizations are not the authorities of [[building code]]s or standards, but rather exist to promote the understanding and development of prestressed concrete design, codes and best practices.

Rules and requirements for the detailing of reinforcement and prestressing tendons are specified by individual national codes and Standards such as the European Standard [[EN 1992]]-2:2005 – [[Eurocode]] 2: Design of Concrete Structures, the US Standard [[American Concrete Institute#ACI318|ACI318]]: Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete, and the [[Standards Australia|Australian Standard]] AS 3600-2009: Concrete Structures.

'''Room 13 International''' is a network of [[The arts|arts]] [[studio]]s in [[primary school]]s worldwide. Each studio is run by the students as a [[Self-sufficiency|self-sufficient business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-8070.2012.01762.x|author=Gibb, C.|year=2012|title= Room 13: The Movement and International Network|journal=International Journal of Art &amp; Design Education|volume= 31|pages= 237–244|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1476-8070.2012.01762.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network is named after the first such studio, which operated in Room 13 in the [[Caol Primary School]] in [[Fort William, Scotland]].

As of 2012, the network consists of over 80 studios around the globe.

==History==
The first studio in Room 13 of the Caol Primary School in Fort William, [[Scotland]] was started by [[Rob Fairley]], an [[Artist-in-residence]], and his students, in 1994.

In 2003, Room 13 won a £200,000 award from [[NESTA]] to expand the project into other schools. By 2005, Room 13 Caol had become the global headquarters for a network of 10 Room 13 studios in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Nepal]], [[South Africa]] and [[Dunedin, New Zealand]].

The '''Rosa Luxemburg Foundation''' ({{lang-de|Rosa-Luxemburg-Stiftung}}) named in recognition of [[Rosa Luxemburg]], occasionally referred to as ''Rosa-Lux'', is a transnational alternative policy group and educational institution, centered in [[Germany]] and affiliated to the democratic socialist [[Left Party (Germany)| Left Party]]. The foundation, which was established in [[Berlin]] in 1990 (originally as the "Social Analysis and Political Education Association").&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, William. 2014.  “Alternative Policy Groups and Transnational Counter-Hegemonic Struggle.” Pp. 259-84 in Yıldız Atasoy (ed.) Global Economic Crisis and the Politics of Diversity. London &amp; New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals and Activities==
RosaLux’s mission is to engage productively with what it sees as a diverse, pluralistic and transnational 'political left’, and to help develop its transformative capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, William. 2014.  “Alternative Policy Groups and Transnational Counter-Hegemonic Struggle.” Pp. 259-84 in Yıldız Atasoy (ed.) Global Economic Crisis and the Politics of Diversity. London &amp; New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, the foundation's activities consists of two main tracks: general political education and academic/scientific work. 

Through the '''Institute for Critical Social Analysis''', RosaLux delivers critical research on neoliberal capitalism, produces analytic work on political strategy, policy and democratic socialist alternatives, as well as work addressing injustices pertaining to gender, sexuality, race and nation.&lt;ref&gt;.http://rosalux.de/english/foundation/research-projects.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the '''Academy for Political Education,''' the foundation offers extensive programs of political education in the form of public conferences, seminars and workshops, and provides courses for youth and adult learners on topics including economic literacy, gender inequalities, sustainable development and political communication. It engages social movements directly and through media such as its website, public events and through the production of informational materials such as pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rosalux.de/english/foundation/political-education.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Further, through the '''Centre for International Dialogue and Cooperation''', it engages and supports social movement groups and organizations in Latin America, Africa, Asia, Europe and North America in the form of funding, as well as through seminars and conferences that are organized with local partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rosalux.de/english/worldwide.html&lt;/ref&gt;

While the foundation is centered in Germany, its transnational presence and reach is extensive, with 16 foreign offices supporting activities in more than 25 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, William. 2014.  “Alternative Policy Groups and Transnational Counter-Hegemonic Struggle.” Pp. 259-84 in Yıldız Atasoy (ed.) Global Economic Crisis and the Politics of Diversity. London &amp; New York: Palgrave MacMillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4718">'''Sander L. Gilman''' (born February 21, 1944) is an American [[cultural history|cultural]] and [[history of literature|literary historian]].&lt;ref name="psp"&gt;[http://www.psp.emory.edu/SanderGilman/index.html Emory.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his contributions to [[Jewish studies]] and the [[history of medicine]]. He is the author or editor of over ninety books.

Gilman's focus is on medicine and the echoes of its rhetoric in social and political discourse. In particular, Gilman investigates the constellations of medical, social, and political discourse that emerge at certain historical junctures.

==Academic career==

Gilman obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] from [[Tulane University]] in 1963, where he proceeded to gain his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree, also in German, in 1968. He was a Professor at [[Cornell University]] (1976–1995), then moving to the [[University of Chicago]] for six years (1994–2000). He was then at the [[University of Illinois]] at Chicago for four years, founding its Program in Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.emory.edu/SanderGilman/Dr.%20GilmanCV%20updated%20Dec%2008.pdf Emory.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 he was appointed a distinguished professor of the Liberal Arts and Sciences at [[Emory University]], where he was the Director of the Program in Psychoanalysis as well as of Emory University’s Health Sciences Humanities Initiative.  During 2017-8 he was the Alliance Professor of History at the Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich.

In 2007 he was appointed Professor, Institute in the Humanities, Birkbeck College (London) and a Visiting Fellow of the new Institute of Advanced Studies, Warwick University, UK. He was president of the [[Modern Language Association]] in 1995.  He has been awarded a Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) at the University of Toronto in 1997, elected an honorary professor of the Free University in Berlin (2000), made an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 2008 and made a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2016).

==Writing==
His ''Stand Up Straight! A History of Posture'' appeared with Reaktion Press (London) in 2018; his most recent edited volume is ''Jews on the Move:  Modern Cosmopolitanist Thought and Its Others'' published in 2018.   He is the author of the basic study of the visual stereotyping of the mentally ill, ''Seeing the Insane'', published by John Wiley and Sons in 1982 (reprinted: 1996) as well as the standard study of ''[[Jewish Self-Hatred]]'', the title of his Johns Hopkins University Press monograph of 1986."&lt;ref name="psp"/&gt;

===Freud===

He has examined [[Sigmund Freud]], addressing the question of what role, if any, was played by Freud’s Jewish origins in his composition of the psychoanalytic corpus. Gilman’s thesis concerning this subject is that the prejudices of biology in the nineteenth century classified the Jew as being somehow [[Femininity|feminine]], a [[social stigma|stigma]] that Freud sought to escape by carving out a scientific niche of his own. Licensed by his own brand of science, Freud could simultaneously lay claim to the [[manhood]] that the Viennese scientific establishment of the nineteenth century threatened to deny him, and also to the neutrality that was the warrant of its authority.

To make the case that contemporaneous [[anti-Semitism]] shaped Freud’s thought, Gilman provides a catalogue of the most egregious anti-Semitic stereotypes of the time and place, including straightforward documentation of certain anti-Semitic prejudices, such as the belief in Jewish [[male menstruation]],&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, Sander. ''Creating Beauty to Cure the Soul''. 1998, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as period depictions of anti-Semitic [[stereotypes]] in graphic media.

==Editorial board membership==
Gilman sits on the Honorary International Advisory Board of the [[Mens Sana Monographs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmonographs.org/aboutus.asp Member, Hon Int Advisory Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physiology]], the term '''serous fluid''' or '''serosal fluid''' (originating from the [[Medieval Latin]] word ''serosus'', from [[Latin]] ''serum'') is any of various [[body fluid]]s resembling serum, that are typically pale yellow and transparent and of a [[benign]] nature. The fluid fills the inside of [[body cavity|body cavities]]. Serous fluid originates from [[serous gland]]s, with secretions enriched with [[protein]]s and [[water]]. Serous fluid may also originate from mixed glands, which contain both [[mucous cell|mucous]] and serous cells. A common trait of serous fluids is their role in assisting [[digestion]], [[excretion]], and [[respiratory system|respiration]].

In medical fields, especially [[cytopathology]], serous fluid is a synonym for effusion fluids from various [[body cavities]]. Examples of effusion fluid are [[pleural effusion]] and [[pericardial effusion]]. There are many causes of effusions which include involvement of the cavity by [[cancer]]. Cancer in a serous cavity is called a [[serous carcinoma]]. [[Cytopathology]] evaluation is recommended to evaluate the causes of effusions in these cavities.&lt;ref name="Shidham"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shidham | first1 = Vinod B. | last2 = Atkinson | first2 = Barbara F. | title = Cytopathologic diagnosis of serous fluids | edition = 1 | publisher = Saunders Elsevier | year = 2007 | location = Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | isbn = 978-1-4160-0145-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
[[Saliva]] consists of [[mucus]] and serous fluid; the serous fluid contains the [[enzyme]] [[amylase]], which is important for the [[digestion]] of [[carbohydrate]]s. Minor [[Von Ebner's glands|salivary glands of von Ebner]] present on the [[tongue]] [[secretion|secrete]] the [[lipase]]. The [[parotid gland]] produces purely serous saliva. The other major [[salivary gland]]s produce mixed (serous and mucus) saliva.

Another type of serous fluid is secreted by the [[serous membrane]]s (serosa), two-layered membranes which line the [[body cavities]]. Serous membrane fluid collects on microvilli on the outer layer and acts as a [[lubricant]] and reduces [[friction]] from [[muscle]] movement. This can be seen in the [[lungs]], with the [[pleural cavity]].

[[Blood serum]] is the component of [[blood]] that is neither a [[blood cell]], nor a [[clotting factor]]. Blood serum and blood plasma are similar, but serum does not contain any clotting factors, such as [[fibrinogen]], [[prothrombin]], [[thromboplastin]] and many others. Serum includes all [[protein]]s not used in [[coagulation]] (clotting), and all the [[electrolyte]]s, [[antibodies]], [[antigen]]s, [[hormone]]s, and any [[exogenous]] substances, like [[drug]]s and [[microorganism]]s.

[[File:Shinshu univ ueda koudou2.JPG|thumb|Faculty of Textile Science and Technology Auditorium. Cultural property. Construction 1929.]]
In September 2005, the university chair decided not to participate in national or international rankings in the foreseeable future, stating the administrative expenditures needed as a main reason. The small sample size used by many rankings and their methodology have also been criticised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrance ceremony President Greetings|publisher=Atsushi Komiyama|url=http://www.shinshu-u.ac.jp/guidance/president/|date=September 21, 2005|accessdate=April 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Shinshu University is still being featured in international rankings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">A '''short-term exposure limit''' ('''STEL''') is the acceptable average exposure over a short period of time, usually 15 minutes as long as the time-weighted average is not exceeded.  

STEL is a term used in [[occupational health]], [[industrial hygiene]] and [[toxicology]].  The STEL may be a [[law|legal]] limit in the [[United States]] for exposure of an employee to a [[chemical substance]].  The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (U.S. OSHA) has set OSHA-STELs for [[1,3-Butadiene]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10087 29CFR1910.1051]&lt;/ref&gt; [[benzene]]   &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10042 29CFR1910.1028]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[ethylene oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10070 29CFR1910.1047]&lt;/ref&gt;  For chemicals, STEL assessments are usually done for 15 minutes and expressed in [[parts per million]] (ppm), or sometimes in [[milligram]]s per cubic meter (mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

The [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] publishes a more extensive list of  STELs as [[threshold limit value]]s (TLV-STEL).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acgih.org/home.htm American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6088">'''Simon House''' is at 33 Daveys Bay Road, [[Mount Eliza, Victoria|Mount Eliza]] in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]. The house was constructed in the 1960s during the period of architectural experimentation on materiality and structure in houses. Simon House was the first project received on the day when [[Guilford Marsh Bell|Guilford Bell]] and [[Neil Clerehan]] opened their office in South Yarra. The Simons were Clerehan’s partners but the house was a collaboration of partners. Therefore, the house has a mixture of both Clerehan and Bell’s typical style of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=15|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The house is a single-storey house, planned in a rectangular shape. The house consists of five bedrooms, two toilets, two garages, one kitchen, dining room, living room, pool and terrace. The enclosed pool, natural finishes, glazed wall and an extensive view over the bay recalled contemporary Californian house of architects like [[Craig Ellwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Simon house diagram plan.jpg|thumb|design diagram]]

== Design Approach ==
The central core program of the house was a pool and terrace, positioned right in the centre of the house. With the pool and terrace in the centre with programs surrounds &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
that engaged with it, allows family members to gather together. It was said that was one of Clerehan’s conception of the house where how he deal with the provision of a frame for family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/money/profile-neil-clerehan/2006/08/07/1154802816814.html?page=2 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Profile: Neil Clerehan | date=9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The pool and living room aligned on axis, forming the central part of a symmetrical square plan. Then the programs around the pool were given a corresponding position in the house’s spatial hierarchy. Because of this distinct insistence of having an equivalent position of programs, the programs are mirrored and consist of dual garages and entrances. It was said that was one of Bell’s typical style of architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell has been influenced by the architecture and gardens of Japan. As a countryman, he feels, when in the city, a hunger for the freedom of sky and vegetation. He thinks that a building must stand in spectacular relationship to its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1952-1980 Architecture of Guilford Bell|year=1982|publisher=Proteus Publishing Pty. Ltd.|location=South Melbourne|isbn=0-949635-00-6|pages=7–9|author=Anne Imrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the pool and terrace positioned in the centre of the house, the engagement between the indoor and outdoor spaces then became ambiguous. It creates a sense of feeling when one is inside, it will feels like outdoors and when one is outside it will feels like indoors. One of his design principal was that he thinks of views or views from the building first, instead of the form of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1952-1980 Architecture of Guilford Bell|year=1982|publisher=Proteus Publishing Pty. Ltd.|location=South Melbourne|isbn=0-949635-00-6|pages=7–9|author=Anne Imrie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, glass panels are used across the living and dining areas to capture the view of the bay.[[File:Image of simon house.JPG|thumb|perspective view of outside terrace]]

== Current ==
Unfortunately, one of the garage have been renovated into a main entrance, also as a living room. Another garage is built right opposite the existing garage. In this approach, it loses the spatial qualities of the house but in turn allows a convenient use to the owner in the house’s circulation.
[[File:Simon house current view.JPG|thumb|current view of Simon House garage]]

== Materiality ==
The materiality that uses in the house were unadorned, they are fibrous plaster ceiling left in natural, unpainted stated, flat steel decking roof, timber walls, and reinforced concrete floor slab under concrete block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Neil Clerehan and Guilford Bell has received numerous honours for his architectural works while they were practicing architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.tce.rmit.edu.au/E03159/ModMelb/mm2/modmelbprac2/nc/ncbio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001042824/http://users.tce.rmit.edu.au/e03159/ModMelb/mm2/modmelbprac2/nc/ncbio.html |archivedate=2009-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Simon House was the most prominent work of Bell Clerehan partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Architecture of Neil Clerehan|year=2005|publisher=RMIT University Press|location=Melbourne|isbn=0-86459-383-X|pages=37–41|author=Black R&amp; Edquist H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The home beautiful considered the pool, terrace to be one of Australia’s outstanding outdoor areas. The Simon house won the Victorian Architecture Medal in 1963-1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.tce.rmit.edu.au/E03159/ModMelb/mm2/modmelbprac2/nc/ncbio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001042824/http://users.tce.rmit.edu.au/e03159/ModMelb/mm2/modmelbprac2/nc/ncbio.html |archivedate=2009-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1392">'''Situational analysis''' (or '''Situational logic''') is a concept advanced by [[Karl Popper|Popper]] in his [[The Poverty of Historicism]]. ''Situational analysis'' is a process by which a social scientist tries to reconstruct the problem situation confronting an agent in order to understand that agent's choice.

[[Noretta Koertge|Koertge]] (1975) provides a helpful clarificatory summary.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;This use of this summary is from Boumans and Davis (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Ethnomusicology''' is, with the [[International Council for Traditional Music]] and the [http://www.bfe.org.uk/ British Forum for Ethnomusicology], one of three major international associations for [[ethnomusicology]]. Its mission is "to promote the research, study, and performance of music in all historical periods and cultural contexts."&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

Officially founded in 1955, its origins extend back to November, 1953 at the annual meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]] in Philadelphia with an informal agreement between [[Willard Rhodes]], [[David P. McAllester|David McAllester]], and [[Alan P. Merriam]].&lt;ref&gt;Merriam, Alan. 1953. "Introduction." ''Ethno-musicology Newsletter'' 1 (December), 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; These three traveled together to the annual meeting of the [[American Musicological Society]] in New Haven to enlist the support of musicologist [[Charles Seeger]] in their endeavor to create a new academic society. This meeting resulted in the launch of the ''Ethno-musicology Newsletter'', ethnomusicology's first dedicated serial publication, containing notes about current field research projects, a bibliography, and list of recordings of interest to the nascent discipline. The first annual meeting of the society was in [[Philadelphia]], in September 1955.

Over the decades, The Society for Ethnomusicology has created a setting that allows scholars to publish and present their work from the field, better communicate and connect with fellow researchers, and provides leadership opportunities for those striving to improve the field of ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Nettl, “We’re on the Map: Reflections on SEM in 1955 and 2005,” ''Ethnomusicology'' 50 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The society currently publishes a quarterly newsletter, a quarterly journal entitled ''Ethnomusicology'', and an extensive set of "ographies" (bibliography, discography, filmography, videography). It organizes an annual international conference and over a dozen regional conferences, maintains an active website, and presents more than a dozen awards for scholarship and service, such as the [[Jaap Kunst]] prize for the best published article in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnomusicology.org/general/custom.asp?page=Prizes_Kunst |title=Jaap Kunst Prize - Society for Ethnomusicology |publisher=Ethnomusicology.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of SEM==

===Before 1953===

The founding of the [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/ Society for Ethnomusicology] was not the first attempt at an organization focusing on the music of the world. Before the work of SEM’s founders in the 1950s, several efforts in Europe had taken place through the work of dozens of musicologists and those who would eventually be considered ethnomusicologists, including [[Frances Densmore]], [[Helen Heffron Roberts]], and [[George Herzog (ethnomusicologist)|George Herzog]]. These and other scholars found inspiration in Viennese [[Guido Adler]] and Englishman [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]], who both produced articles in 1885 discussing “ethnological studies” of music and the equal treatment of every society’s music.&lt;ref name="Nettl181"&gt;Nettl 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, scholars turned to Austrian [[Erich Moritz von Hornbostel]], credited with inventing the musical instrument categorization system still used today, and his 1905 article outlining "The Problems of Comparative Musicology."&lt;ref name="Nettl180"&gt;Nettl 180.&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ethnomusicology, though casually used towards the mid-1900s, was not widely used officially. The word first appeared in publication in [[Jaap Kunst]]'s book, ''Ethno-musicology; a study of its nature, its problems, methods representative personalities'', which wasn’t published in 1955.&lt;ref name="Nettl180"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jaap Kunst, ''Ethno-musicology; a study of its nature, its problems, methods and representative personalities; to which is added a bibliography'', Martinus Nijhoff, The Hauge, Netherlands, 1955, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

These works are a few of the examples of some of the musical thought taking place at the turn of the century. However, many European thinkers found fewer resources and more censorship with the incoming Second World War. In response, Charles Seeger helped found the American Society for Comparative Musicology to house the number of musicologists fleeing the rise of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="Nettl181"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Willard Rhodes, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/924574 A Decade of Progress]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 7 (1963): 178, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SEM History"&gt;William Rhodes, "[http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=History_Founding SEM History]", The Society for Ethnomusicology Website, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953===

In November 1953, [[David P. McAllester]], [[Alan P. Merriam]], and [[Willard Rhodes]] attended the 52nd Annual Meeting of the [[American Anthropological Association]] taking place in the city of [[Philadelphia]]. The three found they shared a common interest, particularly in North American Indian music, but also had productive conversation about, "the problems of ethnomusicology, historical, theoretical and methodological, and above all, a need for association and communication with persons with similar interests."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; The scholars believed that the ever-evolving field of ethnomusicology would be better navigated if the scholars, musicologist, anthropologists, and anyone with passion for ethnomusicology formed a society. The three agreed that producing a newsletter was the first step in founding a society, as it would unite the wider community of scholars to better communicate research and ideas of their fellow scholars. Rhodes suggested seeking out colleague [[Charles Seeger]] as a fellow conspirator. Following the American Anthropology Association meeting, the team traveled to the [[American Musicological Society]] annual meeting the following December. Seeger became the fourth member of the group and, under his consultation and Merriam’s editorship, the Newsletter began to take shape.

Ignited and led by McAllester, Merriam, Rhodes, and Seeger, Ethno-musicology Newsletter No. 1 was mailed to about 300 individuals and institutions. While the initial effort towards the creation of the Newsletter lies solely with these four men, many other scholars were working towards the goals the Newsletter set out to promote. A letter separate from the Newsletter signed by the aforementioned four, but also [[Manfred Bukofzer]], [[Frances Densmore]], Mieczslaw Kolinksi, [[Curt Sachs]] (who worked alongside Hornbostel), [[Harold Spivacke]], and Richard Waterman, was sent to about 70 individuals. The letter stated, "It must be emphasized that the present effort is the prerogative of no individual or group of individuals rather, the project is conceived as the joint effort of all those interested in seeing contact reestablished among ethnomusicologists."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt;

===1955-1962===

The popularity of the Newsletter increased dramatically, jumping to 472 recipients by April 1955.&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; With the intense interest in ethnomusicology, it was felt that the society could soon be founded. The September Newsletter announced that an organized meeting of ethnomusicologists would take place at the 54th Annual Meeting of American Anthropology Association in [[Boston]] on November 18, 1955. McAllester, Merriam, Rhodes, Seeger, and several others, nearly all recipients of the Newsletter, founded the Society for Ethnomusicology and elected its first council:

President: Williard Rhodes,

Honorary President: Curt Sachs

Vice President: Mieczlaw Kolinki

Sectretary-Treasurer: David McAllester

Editor: Alan Merriam

The first official annual conference for the Society for Ethnomusicology was held the following year in alongside the 5th International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences on September 5, 1956 in Philadelphia. The constitution was drafted, officer positions expanded, and mission statement defined: “…to promote the research, study, and performance of music in all historical periods and cultural contexts."&lt;ref name="SEM History"/&gt; It was also decided that the hyphen would be removed from ethno-musicology with some disapproval."&lt;ref&gt;David P., McAllester, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/852423 Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992)]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 37 (1993): 251-262, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, it was recorded that 25% of the Society’s membership was made up of non-U.S. residents and only 7% of that were Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The Newsletter expanded and added David McAllester and [[Bruno Nettl]] as editors. In 1962, [[Wesleyan University]] took over the publication of the printed pamphlet newsletter, which had until this point been sponsored by the founding four.

===1963-1955===

In 1963, The Society for Ethnomusicology produce a special, tenth anniversary issue with articles that looked back at the Newsletter and Society’s accomplishments. Challenged to find a way to measure these successes, David McAllester and Donald Winkelman both commented on the impressive efforts made at academic institutions around the country to include courses entirely or partially related to ethnomusicology.  In McAllester’s “Ethnomusicology: The Field and the Society” article, he quoted Winkelman’s finding that about 30 institutions offered anywhere from one to fourteen courses related to ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;David P., McAllester, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/924575 Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 7 (1963): 182, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This is an incredible number when compared to the findings of [[Bruno Nettl]], who had been charged to construct a survey of the institutions that offered courses in ethnomusicology in 1954, which showed that only fourteen institutions made the list.&lt;ref&gt;Nettl 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Winkelman found that the number had doubled in about ten years.

Among these institutions, a few stood out as academic leaders in ethnomusicology in 1963. [[UCLA]] offered one of the largest graduate program, which believed that the “actual performance of an exotic music is essential to the full understand of its structure and purpose."&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society,” 183.&lt;/ref&gt; UCLA was also praised for sending its graduate students abroad to be immersed in a culture and its music. The [[University of Hawaii]] was well known for its ability to harmonize the relationship between the anthropology and music departments, drawing from both to create well-rounded ethnomusicology courses. Alan Merriam had made significant headway at Indiana University, having been made a Professor of Anthropology in 1962, equipped with skills in African music, music analysis, and Indian music. He worked closely with music professor and ethnomusicologist, [[Walter Kaufmann (ethnomusicologist)|Walter Kaufmann]]. At [[Columbia University]], Willard Rhodes had already been teaching some ethnomusicology course since he was made full Professor in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992),” 255.&lt;/ref&gt; He helped develop the ethnomusicology depart alongside Nicholas England, but later traveled to Africa and Asia to conduct and bring back research.&lt;ref&gt;McAllester, “Obituary: Willard Rhodes (1901-1992),” 256.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Nettl]] and Richard Waterman were able to bridge the gap between the anthropology and music departments by teaching across both departments, bringing up [[Wayne State University]] as one of the countries strongest ethnomusicology institutions.&lt;ref name="McAllester184"&gt;McAllester, "Ethnomusicology, the Field and the Society," 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, [[Wesleyan University]] had already proven its great strength and devotion to ethnomusicology by printing the Newsletter, but McAllester continued to develop the ethnomusicology department throughout his time there.&lt;ref name="McAllester184"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie C., Wade, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20174447 Fifty Years of SEM in the United States: A Retrospective]", ''Ethnomusicology'' 50 (2006): 192, accessed 29 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the rise in institutions teaching ethnomusicology courses, Williard Rhodes found that students were able to produce more dissertations that ever before. Rhodes believed that this was because the Newsletter’s Bibliographies and Reviews sections had given students access to material and research that had previously been unavailable to them: “In comparison with the limited ethnomusicological literature in English that appeared during the first half of the present century, the production of books and monographs during the past decade is remarkable in quantity, quality, and range of subject matter."&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, “A Decade of Progress,” 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes found that Frank Gillis’ 1962 supplement (Ethnomusicology 6: 191-214) written for Alan Merriam’s 1960 “Annotated Bibliography of Theses and Dissertations in Ethnomusicology and Folk Music Accepted at American Universities” (''Ethnomusicology'' 4: 21-35) showed an increase from 180 to 197 titles nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes, “A Decade of Progress,” 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

===Governance===

The Society is governed by a Constitution, Board of Directors, Council Members, and stands by its strict Bylaws. There are several standing committees that members can participate, ranging in size from 4-15 members. Some of these committees organize national events, such as the annual conference, while others operate local events, nominations, awarding of prizes, publications, and student concerns.

===Membership===

The Society offers Individual and Institution Memberships, which offer benefits and additional resources not available to the public. Individual membership fees are determined by annual income and academic enrollment (full-time student), but also one-time lifetime memberships are also available. Members receive copies of SEM publications, such as the Newsletter and Journal, gain voting rights, can submit papers for meetings and conferences, can access a members-only section of the website, and receive discounts for certain databases, such as [[JSTOR]].

==Annual Conferences==

The first official SEM meeting was September 2–9, 1956, and since then, the Society of Ethnomusicology has continued to host annual conferences throughout the country and occasionally abroad. Locations for these large-scale gatherings require a host university with a strong ethnomusicology department, hotels that can house the huge number of attendees ranging, which ranges from 800-1000 people, at an affordable price, and has access to air travel. Locations are typical chosen three years in advance by the SEM Board. The conference is then executed by the Program Committee, Local Arrangements Committee, and Business Office. 
 
The Annual Meetings are made up of programs, paper presentations, lectures, banquets, and special events, which include diverse performances, formal concerts, and dances. Video-streaming will be available for several paper presentations. 
 
The 58th Annual Meeting will take place in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], from November 14–17, hosted by [http://www.iub.edu/ Indiana University Bloomington]. The programs and schedule are available [http://www.indiana.edu/~semhome/2013/index.shtml here].

The 59th Annual Meeting will take place in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] from November 13–16, 2014. It will be hosted by [http://www.pitt.edu/ The University of Pittsburgh].
 
The 60th Annual Meeting will be in [[Austin, Texas]] from December 3–6, 2015 and will be hosted by [http://www.utexas.edu/ The University of Texas at Austin].

==Publications==

Alongside the '''''Ethnomusicology''''' journal, The Society for Ethnomusicology publishes a variety of works, nearly all of which are peer-reviewed. The SEM [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/ website] itself serves as a communicative and archival device, enabling members to discuss the latest news, share project updates, and gives digital access to many of the print publications. The SEM website offers free access to the last fifteen issues of the [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_Journal journal] (currently volumes 43-57 from 1999-2013), the [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_StudentNews student newsletter], and on-going lists of [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_JournalOgraphies Ographies], including bibliographies, discographies, and dissertations. Issues of the SEM [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?Pub_Newsletter Newsletter] are also available from between 2002-2010, volumes 36-44, however, the latest digital copies are only available to members. A full list of SEM’s publications available through the website can be found [http://www.ethnomusicology.org/?page=Publications_Home here].

==Prizes==

SEM awards prizes on national, chapter, and sectional levels. These awards are designed to recognize the work of individuals in the field of ethnomusicology. Awards vary in purpose, financial prize (if any), eligibility, where and how often the prize is awarded, and application deadline.

'''Structural integrity and failure''' is an aspect of engineering which deals with the ability of a structure to support a designed load (weight, force, etc...) without breaking, and includes the study of past structural failures in order to prevent failures in future designs.

Structural integrity is the ability of an item—either a structural component or a structure consisting of many components—to hold together under a load, including its own weight, without breaking or deforming excessively. It assures that the construction will perform its designed function during reasonable use, for as long as its intended life span. Items are constructed with structural integrity to prevent [[catastrophic failure]], which can result in injuries, severe damage, death, and/or monetary losses.

''Structural failure'' refers to the loss of structural integrity, or the loss of [[Structural load|load]] -carrying capacity in either a structural component, or the [[Architectural structure|structure]] itself. Structural failure is initiated when a [[List of building materials|material]] is stressed beyond its [[Strength of materials|strength]] limit, causing fracture or excessive [[Deformation (engineering)|deformations]]; one [[Limit state design|limit state]] that must be accounted for in structural design is ultimate failure strength. In a well- designed system, a localized failure should not cause immediate or even progressive collapse of the entire structure.

==Introduction==
Structural integrity is the ability of a structure to withstand its intended loading without failing due to fracture, deformation, or fatigue.  It is a concept often used in engineering to produce items that will serve their designed purposes and remain functional for a desired [[service life]] .

To construct an item with structural integrity, an engineer must first consider a material’s mechanical properties, such as [[toughness]], [[Strength of materials|strength]], weight, [[hardness]], and elasticity, and then determine the size and shape necessary for the material to withstand the desired load for a long life. Since members can neither break nor bend excessively, they must be both stiff and tough.  A very stiff material may resist bending, but unless it is sufficiently tough, it may have to be very large to support a load without breaking.  On the other hand, a highly elastic material will bend under a load even if its high toughness prevents fracture.

Furthermore, each component’s integrity must correspond to its individual application in any load-bearing structure.  Bridge supports need a high [[yield strength]], whereas the bolts that hold them need good [[Shear strength|shear]] and [[tensile strength]]. Springs need good elasticity, but [[lathe]] tooling needs high rigidity.  In addition, the entire structure must be able to support its load without its weakest links failing, as this can put more stress on other structural elements and lead to [[cascading failure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Engineering Design: Modelling, Synthesis and Problem Solving Strategies'' By Andrew E. Samuel, John Weir -- Elsevier 1999 Page 3--5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Structural Integrity of Fasteners, Volume 2'' Edited by Pir M. Toor -- ASTM 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The need to build structures with integrity goes back as far as recorded history. Houses needed to be able to support their own weight, plus the weight of the inhabitants. Castles needed to be fortified to withstand assaults from invaders. Tools needed to be strong and tough enough to do their jobs. However, the science of [[fracture mechanics]] as it exists today was not developed until the 1920s, when [[Alan Arnold Griffith]] studied the [[Fracture#Brittle fracture|brittle fracture]] of glass.

Starting in the 1940s, the infamous failures of several new technologies made a more scientific method for analyzing structural failures necessary.  During World War II, over 200 welded-steel ships broke in half due to brittle fracture, caused by stresses created from the welding process, temperature changes, and by the [[stress concentration]]s at the square corners of the bulkheads.  In the 1950s, several [[De Havilland Comet]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s exploded in mid-flight due to stress concentrations at the corners of their squared windows, which caused cracks to form and the pressurized cabins to explode.  [[Boiler explosion]]s, caused by failures in pressurized boiler tanks, were another common problem during this era, and caused severe damage. The growing sizes of bridges and buildings led to even greater catastrophes and loss of life. This need to build constructions with structural integrity led to great advances in the fields of material sciences and fracture mechanics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Assuring structural integrity in army systems'' By National Research Council (U.S.). National Materials Advisory Board, National Research Council (U.S.). Commission on Engineering and Technical Systems, National Research Council (U.S.). Committee on Assurance of Structural Integrity -- 1985 Page 1--19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Structural Integrity Monitoring'' By R.A. Collacott -- Chapman and Hall 1985 Page 1--5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of failure==
Structural failure can occur from many types of problems, most of which are unique to different industries and structural types. However, most can be traced to one of five main causes.
* The first is that the structure is not strong and tough enough to support the load, due to either its size, shape, or choice of material. If the structure or component is not strong enough, catastrophic failure can occur when the structure is stressed beyond its critical stress level.
* The second type of failure is from fatigue or corrosion, caused by instability in the structure’s geometry, design or material properties. These failures usually begin when cracks form at stress points, such as squared corners or bolt holes too close to the material's edge.  These cracks grow as the material is repeatedly stressed and unloaded (cyclic loading), eventually reaching a critical length and causing the structure to suddenly fail under normal loading conditions.
* The third type of failure is caused by manufacturing errors, including improper selection of materials, incorrect sizing, improper [[heat treating]], failing to adhere to the design, or shoddy workmanship.  This type of failure can occur at any time and is usually unpredictable.
* The fourth type of failure is from the use of defective materials.  This type of failure is also unpredictable, since the material may have been improperly manufactured or damaged from prior use.
* The fifth cause of failure is from lack of consideration of unexpected problems.  This type of failure can be caused by events such as vandalism, sabotage, or natural disasters. It can also occur if those who use and maintain the construction are not properly trained and overstress the structure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

===Bridges===
{{See also|List of bridge disasters}}

====Dee bridge====
{{Main|Dee bridge disaster}}
[[File:Dee bridge disaster.jpg|thumb|The Dee bridge after its collapse]]
The Dee bridge was designed by [[Robert Stephenson]], using [[cast iron]] girders reinforced with wrought iron struts.  On 24 May 1847, it collapsed as a train passed over it, killing five people.  Its collapse was the subject of one of the first formal inquiries into a structural failure.  This inquiry concluded that the design of the structure was fundamentally flawed, as the [[wrought iron]] did not reinforce the cast iron, and that the casting had failed due to repeated flexing.&lt;ref&gt;Petroski, H. (1994) p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Tay Rail Bridge====
{{Main|Tay Bridge disaster}}
The Dee bridge disaster was followed by a number of [[cast iron]] bridge collapses, including the collapse of the first [[Tay Rail Bridge]] on 28 December 1879. Like the Dee bridge, the Tay collapsed when a train passed over it, killing 75 people.  The bridge failed because it was constructed from poorly made cast iron, and because designer Thomas Bouch failed to consider wind loading on it.  Its collapse resulted in cast iron being replaced by steel construction, and a complete redesign in 1890 of the [[Forth Railway Bridge]], making it the first entirely steel bridge in the world.&lt;ref name=Tacoma&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Wake of Tacoma: Suspension Bridges and the Quest for Aerodynamic Stability|author=Scott, Richard|year=2001|publisher=ASCE Publications|isbn=0-7844-0542-5|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First Tacoma Narrows Bridge====
{{Main|Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)}}
The 1940 collapse of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge is sometimes characterized in physics textbooks as a classic example of resonance, although this description is misleading. The catastrophic vibrations that destroyed the bridge were not due to simple mechanical resonance, but to a more complicated oscillation between the bridge and winds passing through it, known as [[aeroelastic flutter]]. [[Robert H. Scanlan]], father of the field of bridge aerodynamics, wrote an article about this misunderstanding.&lt;ref&gt;K. Billah and R. Scanlan (1991), ''Resonance, Tacoma Narrows Bridge Failure, and Undergraduate Physics Textbooks'', [[American Journal of Physics]], 59(2), 118--124 [http://www.ketchum.org/billah/Billah-Scanlan.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; This collapse, and the research that followed, led to an increased understanding of wind/structure interactions. Several bridges were altered following the collapse to prevent a similar event occurring again. The only fatality was a dog named Tubby.&lt;ref name=Tacoma/&gt;

====I-35W Bridge====
{{Main|I-35W Mississippi River bridge}}
[[File:35wBridgecollapse.gif|thumb|200px|Security camera images show the I-35W collapse in animation, looking north.]]
The I-35W Mississippi River bridge (officially known simply as Bridge 9340) was an eight-lane steel [[truss arch bridge]] that carried [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|Interstate 35W]] across the [[Mississippi River]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], United States. The bridge was completed in 1967, and its maintenance was performed by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]]. The bridge was Minnesota's fifth–busiest,&lt;ref name="MetroArea2006"&gt;{{cite web| title = 2006 Metro Area Traffic Volume Index Map| publisher =Mn/DOT|year=2006| url = http://www.dot.state.mn.us/traffic/data/maps/indexmaps/2006/metroindex.pdf| format =pdf| accessdate =9 August 2007}} Index map for Mn/DOT's 2006 traffic volumes; relevant maps showing the highest river bridge traffic volumes are Maps 2E, 3E, and 3F.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = week&gt;{{cite web | last = Weeks | first = John A.

The building was under construction and did not have an [[Certificate of occupancy|occupancy certificate]] for its 100 to 150 low- to middle-income residents&lt;ref name=RT&gt;[http://rt.com/news/india-mumbai-buildings-collapses-367/ "45 killed as building collapses in India (PHOTOS)"] ''[[RT News]]'' 5 April 2013. Retrieved 5 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;;&lt;/nowiki&gt; its only occupants were the site construction workers and their families.  The building was reported to have been [[Illegal housing in India|illegally constructed]] because standard practices were not followed for safe, lawful construction, land acquisition and resident  occupancy.

By 11 April, a total of 15 suspects were arrested including [[Construction worker|builders]], engineers, municipal officials, and other responsible parties. Governmental records indicate that there were two orders to manage the number of illegal buildings in the area: a 2005 Maharashtra state order to use [[remote sensing]] and a 2010 [[Bombay High Court]] order. Complaints were also made to state and municipal officials.

On 9 April, the [[Thane Municipal Corporation]] began a campaign to demolish illegal buildings in the area, focusing on “dangerous” buildings, and set up a call center to accept and track the resolutions of complaints about illegal buildings.  The forest department, meanwhile, promised to address encroachment of forest land in the Thane District.

====Savar building collapse====
{{Main|2013 Savar building collapse}}
On 24 April 2013, ''Rana Plaza'', an eight-storey commercial building, collapsed in [[Savar]], a [[Upazilas of Bangladesh|sub-district]] in the [[Greater Dhaka Area]], the capital of [[Bangladesh]]. The search for the dead ended on 13 May with the death toll of 1,129.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Butler |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/23/rana-plaza-factory-disaster-bangladesh-primark |title=Bangladeshi factory deaths spark action among high-street clothing chains &amp;#124; The Observer |work=The Guardian |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 2,515 injured people were rescued from the building alive.&lt;ref name="Yahoo News"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh collapse search over; death toll 1,127|url=https://news.yahoo.com/bangladesh-collapse-search-over-death-toll-1-127-122554495.html|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Advertise on NYTimes.com Bangladesh Factory Collapse Death Toll Hits 1,021|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2013/05/09/world/asia/ap-as-bangladesh-building-collapse.html?ref=global-home|accessdate=10 May 2013|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sampoong Department Store collapse====
{{Main|Sampoong Department Store collapse}}

On 29 June 1995, the five story [[Sampoong Department Store]] in the [[Seocho District]] of [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]] collapsed resulting in the deaths of 502 people, with another 1,445 being trapped.

In April 1995, cracks began to appear in the ceiling of the fifth floor of the store's south wing due to the presence of an air-conditioning unit on the weakened roof of the poorly built structure. On the morning of 29 June, as the number of cracks in the ceiling increased dramatically, store managers closed the top floor and shut off the air conditioning, but failed to shut the building down or issue formal evacuation orders as the executives themselves left the premises as a precaution. 

Five hours before the collapse, the first of several loud bangs was heard emanating from the top floors, as the vibration of the air conditioning caused the cracks in the slabs to widen further. Amid customer reports of vibration in the building, the air conditioning was turned off but, the cracks in the floors had already grown to 10&amp;nbsp;cm wide. At about 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. local time, the fifth floor ceiling began to sink, and at 5:57&amp;nbsp;p.m., the roof gave way, sending the air conditioning unit crashing through into the already-overloaded fifth floor.

====Ronan Point====
{{Main|Ronan Point}}
On 16 May 1968, the 22-story residential tower [[Ronan Point]] in the [[London Borough of Newham]] collapsed when a relatively small gas explosion on the 18th floor caused a structural wall panel to be blown away from the building. The tower was constructed of [[precast]] concrete, and the failure of the single panel caused one entire corner of the building to collapse. The panel was able to be blown out because there was insufficient reinforcement steel passing between the panels. This also meant that the loads carried by the panel could not be redistributed to other adjacent panels, because there was no route for the forces to follow. As a result of the collapse, building regulations were overhauled to prevent [[disproportionate collapse]] and the understanding of precast concrete detailing was greatly advanced. Many similar buildings were altered or demolished as a result of the collapse.&lt;ref name=ConstructionFailure&gt;{{cite book|title=Construction Failure|author1=Feld, Jacob |author2=Carper, Kenneth L. |year=1997|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-471-57477-5|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oklahoma City bombing====
{{Main|Oklahoma City bombing}}
On 19 April 1995, the nine-story concrete framed [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma]] was struck by a huge car bomb causing partial collapse, resulting in the deaths of 168 people. The bomb, though large, caused a significantly disproportionate collapse of the structure. The bomb blew all the glass off the front of the building and completely shattered a ground floor [[reinforced concrete column]] (see [[brisance]]). At second story level a wider column spacing existed, and loads from upper story columns were transferred into fewer columns below by girders at second floor level. The removal of one of the lower story columns caused neighbouring columns to fail due to the extra load, eventually leading to the complete collapse of the central portion of the building. The bombing was one of the first to highlight the extreme forces that blast loading from terrorism can exert on buildings, and led to increased consideration of terrorism in structural design of buildings.&lt;ref name="Virdi2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=Abnormal Loading on Structures: Experimental and Numerical Modelling|author=Virdi, K.S.|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-419-25960-0|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Versailles wedding hall====
{{Main|Versailles wedding hall disaster}}
The Versailles wedding hall ({{lang-he|אולמי ורסאי}}), located in [[Talpiot]], [[Jerusalem]], is the site of the worst civil disaster in [[Israel]]'s history. At 22:43 on Thursday night, 24 May 2001 during the wedding of Keren and Asaf Dror, a large portion of the third floor of the four-story building collapsed.

====World Trade Center Towers 1, 2, and 7====
{{Main|Collapse of the World Trade Center}}
In the [[September 11 attacks]], two commercial airliners were deliberately crashed into the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in New York City. The impact and resulting fires caused both towers to collapse within less than two hours. The impacts severed exterior columns and damaged core columns, redistributing the loads that these columns had carried.  This redistribution of loads was greatly influenced by the hat trusses at the top of each building.&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web | title = NIST's Responsibilities Under the National Construction Safety Team Act | url = https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/factsheet/constructionact.htm | accessdate = 23 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The impacts dislodged some of the fireproofing from the steel, increasing its exposure to the heat of the fires. Temperatures became high enough to weaken the core columns to the point of [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] and [[Plastic deformation#Deformation theory|plastic deformation]] under the weight of higher floors.  The heat of the fires also weakened the perimeter columns and floors, causing the floors to sag and exerting an inward force on exterior walls of the building. WTC Building 7 also collapsed later that day; the 47 story skyscraper collapsed within seconds due to a combination of a large fire inside the building and heavy structural damage from the collapse of the north tower.&lt;ref name="BazantWhy"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bažant |first=Zdeněk P. |authorlink=Zdeněk Bažant |author2=Jia-Liang Le |author3=Frank R.

{{Main|Warsaw radio mast}}
On 8 August 1991 at 16:00 UTC Warsaw radio mast, the tallest man-made object ever built before the erection of [[Burj Khalifa]] collapsed as consequence of an error in exchanging the guy-wires on the highest stock. The mast first bent and then snapped at roughly half its height. It destroyed at its collapse a small mobile crane of Mostostal Zabrze. As all workers left the mast before the exchange procedures, there were no fatalities, in contrast to the similar collapse of [[WLBT Tower]] in 1997.

====Hyatt Regency walkway====
{{Main|Hyatt Regency walkway collapse}}
[[File:HRWalkway.svg|right|thumbnail|Design change on the Hyatt Regency walkways.]]On 17 July 1981, two suspended walkways through the lobby of the [[Hyatt Regency]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], collapsed, killing 114 and injuring more than 200 people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why Buildings Fall Down|author1=M. Levy |author2=M. Salvadori |publisher=Norton &amp; Co.|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a tea dance. The collapse was due to a late change in design, altering the method in which the rods supporting the walkways were connected to them, and inadvertently doubling the forces on the connection. The failure highlighted the need for good communication between design engineers and contractors, and rigorous checks on designs and especially on contractor-proposed design changes. The failure is a standard case study on engineering courses around the world, and is used to teach the importance of ethics in engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Feld, J.; Carper, K.L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15576">'''''The Meaning of the City''''' is a theological essay by [[Jacques Ellul]] which recounts the story of the [[city]] in the [[Bible]] and seeks to explain the city's biblical significance.

Ellul wrote the book in 1951; it was published in English translation in 1970, and then in French in 1975 as ''Sans feu ni lieu : Signification biblique de la Grande Ville''.

== Synopsis ==
Where is the city's foundation? All [[mythology|mythologies]] speak of an [[Garden of Eden|original garden]], returning to which is man's only desire. The city is the world of man: his creation (made in his image) and his pride because it reflects his culture and his civilization. It is also a place of absurdity, of chaos, and of man's power over Nature and man, a place of [[slavery]] par excellence. Ellul recounts, through the course of the Bible, the [[History of the city|city's origins]]. God places man in a garden because this is his natural place, the place to which he is best adapted. But man wished to separate from God and determine his own destiny. All mythologies herald man's return to nature, a return to the original state. Inversely, the Bible anticipates a perfect city, the [[New Jerusalem]]. "This shows that, out of love, God revises his own plans, taking into account the history of men, including their maddest revolts."&lt;ref&gt;Frédéric Rognon, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jacques-ellul-une-pensee-en-dialogue/oclc/180983332&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Jacques Ellul : Une pensée en dialogue''], éd. Labor et Fides, 2007, p.86 [http://www.jacques-ellul.org/influences/la-bible]. "Cela signifie que, par amour, Dieu révise ses propres desseins, pour tenir compte de l'histoire des hommes, y compris de leurs plus folles révoltes."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]], Ellul brings to life the rhythm of the city and unmasks the illusions thence attached, navigating within the Christian dialectic between the [[fall of man]] and [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] in order to give meaning to the present situation of people, who depend on the big city for everything they do.

== Exegesis ==
Ellul gives an [[exegesis]] of the city in the Bible. This is not a formalist or structuralist exegesis, but a traditional exegesis, which is to say it seeks to present the text as it appears today and in its entirety. This means that the author, here, seeks within the Bible all passages which relate to the city, as the basis for a biblical definition of this place. If the author "hears" the more sophisticated meanings given by his contemporaries, he nevertheless considers that one "cannot honestly interpret a text outside its content and the meaning which it gives itself". He therefore refuses to divide the text into independent fragments, instead taking them in their entirely; he considers the text to be essentially [[dialectical]], implying that its meaning arises within an ensemble of contradictory statements. So doing, Ellul does not seek to explain why the Bible says what it says on the subject of cities, but to show what it says.

== Critique of the city ==
It is within the framework of his critique of technique (see ''[[The Technological Society]]'') that Ellul approaches the city. In effect, according to him, the city is the place where technique becomes [[system]], preventing man from living in freedom. And according to Ellul, this freedom arises in work within proximity to God, and later in the perfect example of [[Jesus Christ]]. Thus, "if one follows Ellul, humanity's freedom of choice seems singularly limited: return to the path of the Christian God or accept the dissolution of humanity. Strictly speaking this conception of liberty is a negation of autonomy, is a [[heteronomy]]. Facing this dilemma to which Ellul condemns us, how can we raise a challenge, how can we find a truly autonomous liberty, which is to say find its true characteristics and true limits?".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Jézéquel, ''Jacques Ellul ou l’impasse de la technique'', Revue du Mauss, 2010. "si l’on suit Ellul, la liberté de choix de l’humanité semble singulièrement restreinte : retrouver le chemin du Dieu chrétien ou se résigner à la disparition de l’humanité. Stricto sensu cette conception de la liberté est une négation de l’autonomie, c’est une hétéronomie. Face au dilemme auquel nous condamne Ellul, comment relever le défi, comment retrouver une liberté véritablement autonome, c’est-à-dire trouvant en elle-même ses propres déterminations et ses propres limites ?"&lt;/ref&gt; This remark, published in the ''[[Revue du MAUSS]]'', critiques Ellul's theistic thrust, but also shows the extent to which man wants to live without God, considering that true liberty cannot exist in relation to a creator.

The city is precisely the place created by man. It is the affirmation of man taking his life into his own hands, independently of God; it is the expression of man's rebellion against God. God has placed man at the garden, a place adapted to him. But man refuses the life for which God has destined him, which is unsettled, and men have gathered and organized themselves in order to depend no longer on nature. This political project (see Ellul 1965, ''L'Illusion politique''), the management of the metropolis, underlies the city: security, survival, commerce, collective living... But this city, created to strengthen human solidarity and protect man against natural aggressions, becomes the place to isolation and insecurity. "Divine or celestial, the city reflects with the space of European culture a religious ideal of 'collective life', on which converge all the major issues of future society. The eater of men and the producer of social regulations, of power conflicts and [[culture shock]]s."&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Dumons et Bernard Hours, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/ville-et-religion-en-europe-du-xvie-au-xxe-siecle-la-cite-reenchantee/oclc/690471282&amp;referer=brief_results  ''Ville et religion en Europe du XVIe au XXe siècle - La cité réenchantée''], la pierre et l'écrit, 2010, p.10). "Divine ou céleste, la cité renvoie dans l’espace culturel européen à l’image d’un idéal religieux du « vivre ensemble » où convergent tous les enjeux majeurs de la société future. Mangeuse d’hommes et productrice de nouvelles économies, la ville s’apparente à un espace où s’opèrent toutes sortes de mobilités démographiques, de régulations sociales, de conflits de pouvoir et de chocs culturels"&lt;/ref&gt; The history of cities is the history of religions cross and interlocking, and of the Christian experience of this relationship, principally in relation to the urban conquest through which religion expanded itself. Since the 1960s, thinkers have raised the question of the "Secular City",&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Cox, [http://www.worldcat.org/title/cite-seculiere-essai-theologique-sur-la-secularisation-et-lurbanisation/oclc/77172490&amp;referer=brief_results ''La Cité séculière.

The city is also the location of spiritual conflict. It therefore bears a profound meaning, a spiritual mark, which is the sign of malediction, and the founder of the city is cursed among all. "It is through slavery that Israel is linked to the city." All the cities, within the Bible, are cursed, and "never a word of hope, never a word of pardon for the city, for it is a terrible manifestation of the brilliant morning star, which has debased humanity." This malediction explains all the difficulties, all the problems encountered in cities, and however much one may seek solutions (security, urbanism, isolation), man will never make the city anything but that which it is. Here, one can detect the influence of Ellul's good friend [[Bernard Charbonneau]]. "Ellul was constantly recognizing his debt to Charbonneau", said pastor and theologian Jean-Sébastien Ingrand, director of the Strausbourg Protestant Media Library. Together they published "Outline of a personalist manifesto", in which they denounced, among other things, the city as contrary to liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ellul et Bernard Charbonneau, ''Directives pour un manifeste personnaliste'', 1935, texte dactylographié édité par les groupes d'Esprit de la région du Sud-ouest; publié en 2003 par [http://www.worldcat.org/title/cahiers-jacques-ellul-no-1-les-annees-personnalistes-pour-une-critique-de-la-societe-technicienne/oclc/52772778&amp;referer=brief_results les Cahiers Jacques-Ellul n°1, "''Les années personnalistes''"], p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; "The man of the city is rich in money but poor in space and time", they wrote. "The city is a place of inhumanity, especially the ''[[banlieue]]'', a banal and homogeneous space, the exact opposite of the country. The city is a place of artifice, where nature is vanquished. But note: one must not romanticize nature, which is perfectly capable of defending itself alone. It is man who is fragile, and above all his liberty. Bernard Charbonneau with [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jardin-de-babylone/oclc/2547227&amp;referer=brief_results ''Le jardin de Babylone''] (1969) and Jacques Ellul with [http://www.worldcat.org/title/sans-feu-ni-lieu-signification-biblique-de-la-grande-ville/oclc/2138310&amp;referer=brief_results Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu''] (1975), rediscovered this point.&lt;ref name="Roger Cans"&gt;Roger Cans, ''compte-rendu d’un colloque sur Bernard Charbonneau, précurseur de l’écologie'', organisé du 2 au 4 mai 2011 à l’IRSAM (université de Pau). "L’homme des villes est riche d’argent, mais pauvre d’espace et de temps », écrivent-ils. « La ville est un lieu d’inhumanité, la banlieue surtout, espace banalisé et uniforme, l’exact opposé de la campagne. La ville est un lieu d’artifice, où la nature est vaincue. Mais attention : il ne faut pas idéologiser la nature, qui se défend très bien toute seule. C’est l’homme qui est fragile, et surtout sa liberté. Bernard Charbonneau avec ''Le jardin de Babylone'' (1969) et Jacques Ellul avec Jacques Ellul, ''Sans feu, ni lieu'' (1975), se retrouvent sur ce point"&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has grown to the size foretold by Ellul and Charbonneau, who were witnessing the urbanization of the world, the universalization of technique, and the standardization of all civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Luc Porquet]], « Nous tous pareils » in [http://www.worldcat.org/title/jacques-ellul-lhomme-qui-avait-presque-tout-prevu/oclc/401756457&amp;referer=brief_results ''Jacques Ellul - L'homme qui avait (presque) tout prévu''], Le Cherche-Midi, 2003, p. 151-158&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in 2008, the world's urban population surpassed its rural population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronoo.com/fr/articles/population-mondiale.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Where Charbonneau applied the symbol of [[Babylon]], Ellul focuses on [[Ninevah]]. The big city is a mass which cannot survive without sacrificing liberty. "This, then, is what separates the two men: against the catastrophism of Charbonneau, Ellul presents a Christian hope, which leads from the Garden of Eden to the New Jerusalem foretold in Revelations.".&lt;ref name="Roger Cans"/&gt;

The '''Turin School of Development''' (TSD) was founded in Turin in October 2009 as a joint venture between the [[ILO|International Training Center of the ILO]], the [[Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], the [[University of Turin]] and related [[UN agencies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itcilo.org/en/news/the-way-to-development-is-starting-from-turin/?searchterm=turin%20school%20of%20development Information regarding the founding of the Turin School of Government]&lt;/ref&gt; The first class of postgraduate students matriculated in the 2009-2010 [[academic year]].

==Background==
The International Training Centre of the ILO, launched in October 1990, the postgraduate course on International Trade Law, in collaboration with the [http://iuse.it/en/ University Institute for European Studies (IUSE)] and with the support of distinguished faculty from the [[University of Turin]] and other major European universities. The Program was presented at a special ceremony at the [[Palais des Nations]] in [[Geneva]]. {{cn|date=March 2014}}

New multi-disciplinary programs were developed after the success of this first course, through the same approach, in collaboration with major [[international organizations]] like [[WIPO]], [[UNESCO]] and [[UNCITRAL]]: in 2000 the  Master in Management of Development and the  Master of Law (LL.M) in Intellectual Property; in 2003 the Master in World Heritage and Cultural Projects for Development; in 2006 the Master in Public Procurement Management for Sustainable Development and the  Master in Occupational Safety and Health. At last, in 2010 the  Master In Applied Labour Economics for Development was funded.

===TSD Strength===

The intensive delivery through the optimal combination of distance learning with face-to-face learning meets the learning requirements of a European master's degree. This  particular combination allows also workers to participate to the programs because the time involved for the face to face part is only 4 months. Moreover, some programs offer the possibility of an internship with one of our institutional UN or professional partners.”&lt;ref&gt;http://turinschool.itcilo.org/about-us/our-goals&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masters==

The TSD offers 7 master programs through a unique learning path. 

=== Faculty===

The faculty of the Turin School of Development is a mix of university professors, combined with leading practitioners from the [[UN system]] and key professional bodies.&lt;ref&gt;http://turinschool.itcilo.org/about-us/international-faculty&lt;/ref&gt;

Lectures frequently includes prominent international professors such as Prof. [[David Throsby]], Prof. [[Allen J. Scott|Allen Scott]], Prof. Massimo Marelli (rector of [[University of Naples]]), Prof. Gianmaria Ajani (dean of the [[University of Turin, Faculty of Law|Law Faculty of the University of Turin]]) and Prof [[Helmut Anheier]].

In addition the participants’ learning is closely supported by dedicated [[tutors]]. 

TSD has also an international student body, drawing its students from more than 65 countries worldwide.
Overall, 1,900 participants have graduated and are currently occupying important jobs in their countries or internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://turinschool.itcilo.org/about-us/international-faculty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The Face to Face modules of the masters are held at the [http://www.itcilo.org/en/the-centre/the-turin-campus International Training Centre Campus] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]].

They are also known as accidental plankton or pseudo-plankton (compare: [[pseudoplankton]]), although "pseudoplankton" also defines organisms that do not themselves float but, rather, are attached to other organisms that float.

In [[astronomy]], the '''Vaughan–Preston gap''' refers to the absence of F-, G- and K-type stars with intermediate levels of [[magnetic activity]].  That is, Vaughan and Preston noted {{when|date=November 2018}} two groups of stars with either high or low levels of activity, separated by an apparent gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Vaughan | first1 = A.
