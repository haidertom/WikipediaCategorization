Also, during Alberto Vallarino’s period as minister, Panama managed to be excluded from the list of tax havens by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in July 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Panamá abandona lista de paraísos fiscales de la OCDE|journal=ICEX|date=July 2011|url=http://www.icex.es/icex/es/navegacion-principal/todos-nuestros-servicios/informacion-de-mercados/paises/navegacion-principal/noticias/4511164.html?idPais=PA|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being removed from "the list of countries which identified Panama as an uncooperative tax haven, as is the case of Mexico, France, Italy and others", in the words of Vallarino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Panamá, satisfecho tras salir de lista gris de la OCDE|journal=La Prensa|date=6 July 2011|url=http://www.prensa.com/locales/Panama-satisfecho-salir-lista-OCDE_0_3152684876.html|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropic work==

Alberto Vallarino served as president of the Unión de Trabajo Industrial de Panamá  (1981-1982), Asociación de Industriales Latinoamericanos (1982) and Asociación de Exportadores Panameños (1983); besides being founder and life member of Instituto de Competitividad Infantil de COSPAE; member of Fundación para el Desarrollo Económico y Social de Panamá (Fudespa) and the National Centre of Competitiveness; and president of Fundación Por Un Mejor Panamá.&lt;ref name = "GVA" /&gt;

Since becoming the Latin American Managing Director of Google, Hohagen has made several major business moves for Google Latin America. Not long after the promotion, Hohagen signed a term of behavior adjustment with federal prosecutors to cooperatives in the Fight Against pedophilia on the Internet.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt; Google’s social network, [[Orkut]], which was very popular at the time in Latin America, had quickly been overrun by child pornography. Hohagen’s act of signing the Conduct Adjustment Term not only showed Google’s commitment to Brazilian law, but also Hohagen’s commitment to eradicating online pedophilia.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://br.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idBRN0236025720080702|title=Google Signs Agreement with MP to combat pedophilia on Orkut|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filter Hohagen and Google implemented on Google’s Orkut social network, is said to have reduced child pornography on the site by over 70%.&lt;ref name="globo2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://g1.globo.com/Noticias/Tecnologia/0,,MUL633731-6174,00-FILTRO%2BCORTA%2BEM%2BIMAGENS%2BDE%2BPEDOFILIA%2BNO%2BORKUT%2BDIZ%2BGOOGLE.html|title=Filter cut by 70% images of pedophilia on Orkut, Google says|publisher=Globo|author=Juliana Carpanez |date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he announced the “Doodle for Google” contest, in which children ages six to fifteen where invited to submit a remake of the Google logo inspired by the theme “Brazil’s Future”.  For every entry Google received, the company planted a tree in a forest on the border of São Paulo and Paraná, Brazil. The winner of the contest received a laptop, a trip to the forest, and their design featured on Google for  24 hours.&lt;ref name="exame"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://exame.abril.com.br/marketing/noticias/google-faz-concurso-mudar-logo-24-horas-598202|title=Google faz concurso para mudar logo por 24 horas|language=Portuguese|trans-title=Google makes right call for change for 24 hours|publisher=Exame|author=Maria Fernanda Malozzi|date=2010-09-21|accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1495">The '''Association of Noise Consultants''' (ANC) is a UK-based organisation of companies that are engaged in the business of acoustics, noise and vibration consulting. It was established in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.association-of-noise-consultants.co.uk/|title=ANC - Welcome|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There is a great range of specialisations within the ANC.  Environmental noise consultants carry out measurement, calculation, evaluation and mitigation of [[noise pollution]] to fit within current [[noise regulation]] and produce an [[environmental impact assessment]] often leading to appearance as an expert witness at public inquiries.
In building acoustics, sound insulation is tested between dwellings as required by approved document E of the [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]], schools are designed for optimal learning conditions and the acoustic environments of performing arts venues are designed for their specific intended purposes.

:''For Egypt's central bank, please see [[Central Bank of Egypt]]''

'''Banque Misr''' ({{lang-ar|بنك مصر}}) (Translated: The Bank of Egypt) is an Egyptian bank founded by industrialist [[Talaat Pasha Harb]] in 1920. The government of the [[United Arab Republic]] nationalized the bank in 1960. The bank has [[branch (banking)|branch offices]] in all of Egypt's [[Governorates of Egypt|governorates]], and [[Foreign exchange market|currency exchange]] and [[work permit]] offices for [[foreign worker]]s in Egypt.

== History ==

[[Talaat Pasha Harb]] founded Banque Misr in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Earl L. Sullivan|title=Women in Egyptian Public Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y900ymkaKX4C&amp;pg=PA172|accessdate=6 October 2014|date=1 January 1986|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-2354-0|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had published books in 1907 and 1911 calling for the founding of a national bank with Egyptian financing. (The [[National Bank of Egypt]] was British-owned, and all the other banks in Egypt were owned by foreigners.) Harb modeled Bank Misr’s operations on those of [[Deutsche Orientbank]] with which he was familiar due to his friendship with the owner of a [[Sephardi]] Jewish bank, [[Banque Suarès]]. Harb established Banque Misr and its companies on the basis of certain concepts: all its dealings were in Arabic, Egyptians operated the bank, and the bank restricted share ownership to Egyptian citizens. Misr’s Board of Directors included a number of Sephardic Jews and a [[Copt]]ic Christian. 
  
In 1926 Bank Misr established its first foreign subsidiary, Banque Misr-La France, to serve Egyptian tourists to France. Four years later, Bank Misr joined with Banque Essadine, in Lebanon, to form the joint-venture Banque Misr-Syrie-Liban. This bank then absorbed Banque Ezzeddine &amp; Adib (Izz al-Din) in [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]].

Banque Misr failed in 1939, but was reorganized.

[[File:Talaat Harb Banque Misr 1935.jpg|thumbnail|[[Talaat Harb]] and Medhat Yakan at the opening of a new branch of Banque Misr in 1935.]]

In 1960 [[Gamal Nasser]] nationalised all banks in Egypt, foreign and domestic, including the four largest domestic banks — [[National Bank of Egypt]], Banque Misr, [[Bank of Alexandria]] and [[Banque du Caire]]. The next year, Syria nationalized all banks operating in the country, including Banque Misr's operations there.

* 1963 In Libya, Banque Misr created Nahda Arabian Bank to hold its branches there.
* 1971 Banque Misr absorbed [[Banque de Port-Said]]. Banque de Port-Said had been created in 1960 to hold the Egyptian operations of several foreign bank, including [[Ionian Bank]], [[Ottoman Bank]], [[Banque Belge et Internationale en Egypte]] and [[Bank of Tokyo]].  
* 1975 Liberalization of foreign entry led several Egyptian banks to establish joint venture banks with foreign banks.  
* 1976 Banque Misr established Misr International Bank (MIBank) with Banque Misr owning 44%, [[First Chicago]] 20%, Europartners 10.5%, [[UBAF Bank]] 8.5%, [[Banca di Roma|Banco di Roma]] 7.375%, and Mitsui Bank 2.625%. 
: Misr established Misr American International Bank (MAIB) with [[Bank of America]]. 
: Misr established Misr Exterior Bank in a joint venture with [[Banco Exterior de Espana]]. 
* 1977 Bank MISR established Misr Romanian Bank, together with a number of [[Romania]]n banks. Misr initially owned 51%, with Banca Romana de Comert Exterior owning 19%, and other Romanian banks such as Banca Agricola and Banca Comerciala Romana owning the rest. 
* 1988 [[Banque de Caire]] took a 17% in MIBank, and Misr took over First Chicago's 20% stake. 
* 1995 Banque Misr joined with [[Bank of Alexandria]], [[National Bank of Egypt]], [[Banque du Caire]] and Kato Aromatics to found [[Cairo International Bank]] in [[Uganda]].
* 1996 MIBank sold 10% of its shares to the Egyptian public in an [[initial public offering]].  The remaining shareholders were Misr with some 55%, [[Banca di Roma]] International (10%), [[British Arab Commercial Bank]] (8.5%), [[Commerzbank]] and [[Banco Central Hispano Americano]] (jointly 7.875%) and [[Sakura Bank]] (2.625%). 
* 2004 Banque Misr merged in Misr Exterior Bank. 
* 2005 National Société Générale Bank (NSGB), a joint venture between [[National Bank of Egypt]] and [[France]]'s [[Société Générale]], acquired a majority stake in Misr International Bank (MIBank), making NSGB Egypt’s biggest private sector bank.  Arab African International Bank (AAIB) acquired Misr America International Bank (MAIB). Lebanon’s [[Blom Bank]] increased its stake in Romanian-Egyptian joint venture Misr Romania Bank to 97% by purchasing an 84% stake.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9312">A '''business rule''' defines or constrains some aspect of [[business]] and always resolves to either true or false. Business rules are intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business.&lt;ref name="BRG1" /&gt; Business rules describe the operations, definitions and constraints that apply to an organization.  Business rules can apply to people, processes, corporate behavior and computing systems in an organization, and are put in place to help the organization achieve its goals.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

For example, a business rule might state that ''no credit check is to be performed on return customers''.  Other examples of business rules include requiring a rental agent to disallow a rental tenant if their credit rating is too low, or requiring company agents to use a list of preferred suppliers and supply schedules.

While a business rule may be informal or even unwritten, documenting the rules clearly and making sure that they don't conflict is a valuable activity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}  When carefully managed, rules can be used to help the organization to better achieve goals, remove obstacles to market growth, reduce costly mistakes, improve communication, comply with legal requirements, and increase customer loyalty.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Introduction==
'''Business rules'''  tell an organization ''what'' it can do in detail, while strategy tells it ''how'' to focus the business at a macro level to optimize results.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Put differently, a strategy provides high-level direction about what an organization should do. Business rules provide detailed guidance about how a strategy can be translated to action.

Business rules exist for an organization whether or not they are ever written down, talked about or even part of the organization's consciousness.  However it is a fairly common practice for organizations to gather business rules.  This may happen in one of two ways.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Organizations may choose to proactively describe their business practices, producing a database of rules.  While this activity may be beneficial, it may be expensive and time-consuming.  For example, they might hire a consultant to comb through the organization to document and consolidate the various standards and methods currently in practice.

Gathering business rules is also called rules harvesting or [[business rule mining]]. The [[business analyst]] or consultant can extract the rules from IT documentation (like use cases, specifications or system code).  They may also organize workshops and interviews with subject matter experts (commonly abbreviated as SMEs). Software technologies designed to capture business rules through analysis of legacy source code or of actual user behavior can accelerate the rule gathering processing.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

More commonly, business rules are discovered and documented informally during the initial stages of a project.  In this case the collecting of the business rules is incidental.  In addition, business projects, such as the launching of a new product or the re-engineering of a complex process, might lead to the definition of new business rules.  This practice of incidental, or emergent, business rule gathering is vulnerable to the creation of inconsistent or even conflicting business rules within different organizational units, or within the same organizational unit over time. This inconsistency creates problems that can be difficult to find and fix.

Allowing business rules to be documented during the course of business projects is less expensive and easier to accomplish than the first approach{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}, but if the rules are not collected in a consistent manner, they are not valuable.  In order to teach business people about the best ways to gather and document business rules, experts in business analysis have created the [[business rules approach|Business Rules Methodology]].  This methodology defines a process of capturing business rules in natural language, in a verifiable and understandable way.  This process is not difficult to learn, can be performed in real-time, and empowers business stakeholders to manage their own business rules in a consistent manner.

== Categories ==

According to the white paper by the Business Rules Group,&lt;ref name="BRG1"&gt;Business Rules Group, ''Defining Business Rules ~ What Are They Really?'', [http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/first_paper/br01c0.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; a statement of a business rule falls into one of four categories:
*Definitions of business terms
The most basic element of a business rule is the language used to express it. The very definition of a term is itself a business rule that describes how people think and talk about things. Thus, defining a term is establishing a category of business rule. Terms have traditionally been documented in a [[Glossary]] or as entities in a [[Conceptual schema|conceptual model]].

*Facts relating terms to each other
The nature or operating structure of an organization can be described in terms of the facts that relate terms to each other. To say that a customer can place an order is NOT a business rule, but a ''fact''. '''Facts''' can be documented as natural language sentences or as relationships, attributes, and generalization structures in a graphical model.

*Constraints (also called "action assertions")
Every enterprise constrains behavior in some way, and this is closely related to constraints on what data may or may not be updated. To prevent a record from being made is, in many cases, to prevent an action from taking place.

*Derivations
Business rules (including laws of nature) define how [[knowledge]] in one form may be transformed into other knowledge, possibly in a different form.

== Real world applications and obstacles ==

Business rules are gathered in these situations: 
# When dictated by law
# During the [[business analysis]]
# As an [[ephemeral]] [[aid]] to engineers.
  
This lack of consistent approach is mostly due to the cost and effort required to maintain the list of rules.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

While newer software tools are able to combine business rule management and execution, it is important to realize that these two ideas are distinct, and each provides value that is different from the other.  Software packages automate business rules using [[business logic]].  The term ''business rule'' is sometimes used interchangeably with ''business logic''; however the latter connotes an engineering practice and the former an intrinsic business practice{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.  There is value in outlining an organization's business rules regardless of whether this information is used to automate its operations.

One of the pitfalls in trying to fill the gap between rules management and execution is trying to give business rules the syntax of logic, and merely describing logical constructs in a natural language. Translation for engines is easier, but business users will no longer be able to write down the rules.

== Formal specification ==

Business rules can be expressed using modeling approaches such as [[Unified Modeling Language]], [[Z notation]], [[Business Process Execution Language]], [[Business Process Modeling Notation]], [[Decision Model and Notation]] or the [[Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules]] (SBVR).{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Business rules encoded in computer code in an operational program are known as [[business logic]].

Similar to how [[Business Risks]] can be structured as:

If &lt;condition(s)&gt; Then &lt;consequence(s)&gt;

a Business Rule can be structured as:

When &lt;condition(s)&gt; Then &lt;imposition(s)&gt; Otherwise &lt;consequence(s)&gt;

'''Cees Links''' (born 1957) is a Dutch entrepreneur and the founder and CEO of [[GreenPeak Technologies]], a [[Fabless manufacturing|fabless]] [[semiconductor]] company for [[smart home]] and [[Internet of things]] (IoT) applications.

==Career==
Upon graduation from the [[University of Twente]] in 1982, Links started his career at [[NCR Corporation]]. As product manager, he was responsible for the first concept development and launch of the world’s first wireless LAN product in 1990, [[WaveLAN]], a major innovation at that time. Throughout several acquisitions and divestitures (NCR, AT&amp;T, Lucent Technologies and Agere Systems), Links continued his work in the wireless LAN area, which he turned into a multi-hundred million dollar business for Agere Systems. Links started as product manager, responsible for the initial WiFi marketing and concept creation and in 1996 became general manager of the WiFi business unit. 
He directly closed the deal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/author.asp?section_id=36&amp;doc_id=1266019/|title=Insight into Solar Cells Advances Performance {{!}} EE Times|website=EETimes|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Steve Jobs at Apple Computer in 1999 that ignited the growth of the wireless LAN industry. Though this deal, wireless LANs went on to become the standard communication feature as is known today.

Links has also been involved with wireless next generation technology breakthroughs in the [[ZigBee]] Alliance and the IoT. From 1991 until 2002, Links was involved in the establishment of the [[IEEE 802.11]] standardization committee and the [[Wi-Fi Alliance]]. He was also instrumental in helping to establish the IEEE 802.15 standardization committee to become the basis for the ZigBee/Thread sense and control networking technology and standardization. He is an active member in the ZigBee Alliance.

==GreenPeak Technologies==
In 2004 Links founded [[GreenPeak Technologies]] (originally under the stealth name of Xanadu Wireless), where he was CEO. GreenPeak is a fabless semiconductor company with a strong focus on wireless for sense and control networks in Smart Home and Internet of Things applications. Links got the company launched and uniquely positioned in the market. He has grown the team to +100 people and accelerated growth.

In May 2016, GreenPeak Technologies was acquired by [[Qorvo]], where Links became General Manager of the Wireless Connectivity business unit.

==Awards==
Links was recognized in January 2017 as Wi-Fi pioneer with the Golden Mousetrap Lifetime Achievement award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designnews.com/content/wifi-pioneer-cees-links-sets-his-sights-on-smart-home/155126479047447/|title=WiFi Pioneer Cees Links Sets His Sights on the Smart Home|date=2017-02-07|work=Design News|access-date=2017-07-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education and personal life==
Links was born in 1957 and raised in Amsterdam, the son of Piet Links, a mathematics teacher. He has 6 siblings and grew up with an innate interest for technology, which developed into his passion for engineering during his teens.

Links holds a Masters Degree in Applied Mathematics and a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering from the Twente University of Technology in Enschede, the Netherlands. He graduated from an Advanced Business Management Course from the Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham NC, USA.

Links lives in Maarssen, the Netherlands. He is married, father of five and grandfather of three.

'''Compact Disc Digital Audio''' ('''CDDA''' or '''CD-DA'''), also known as '''Audio CD''', is the [[standardization|standard]] format for audio [[compact disc]]s. The standard is defined in the '''Red Book''', one of a series of "[[Rainbow Books]]" (named for their binding colors) that contain the [[specification (technical standard)|technical specifications]] for all CD [[content format|formats]].

== Standard ==
The ''Red Book'' specifies the physical parameters and properties of the CD, the optical "stylus" parameters, deviations and error rate, modulation system ([[eight-to-fourteen modulation]], EFM) and error correction facility ([[cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding]], CIRC), and the eight [[Compact disc subcode|subcode channels]]. These parameters are common to all [[compact discs]] and used by all logical formats, such as [[CD-ROM]]. The standard also specifies the form of [[digital audio]] encoding: 2-channel [[Signedness|signed]] 16-[[bit]] [[Linear pulse code modulation|Linear PCM]] sampled at [[44,100 Hz]]. Although rarely used, the specification allows for discs to be mastered with a form of [[Emphasis (telecommunications)|emphasis]].

The first edition of the ''Red Book'' was released in 1980 by [[Philips]] and [[Sony]];&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto45-1"/&gt; it was adopted by the Digital Audio Disc Committee and ratified by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] Technical Committee 100, as an International Standard in 1987 with the reference IEC 60908.&lt;ref name="Auto45-2"/&gt; The second edition of IEC 60908 was published in 1999&lt;ref name="Auto45-3"/&gt; and it cancels and replaces the first edition, amendment 1 (1992) and the corrigendum to amendment 1. The IEC 60908 however does not contain all the information for extensions that is available in the Red Book, such as the details for [[CD-Text]], [[CD+G]] and [[CD+EG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edocpublish.com/resources-2/specifications/cd-logos/ Approved Compact Disc Logo configurations]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/bchafy/cdb/info/info.html Specs for Freeware Developers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501075730/http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/bchafy/cdb/info/info.html |date=2012-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard is not freely available and must be licensed. It is available from [[Philips]] and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]. {{As of|2013}}, Philips outsources licensing of the standard to Adminius, which charges {{US$|100}} for the ''Red Book'', plus {{US$|50}} each for the ''Subcode Channels R-W'' and ''CD Text Mode'' annexes.&lt;ref name="philips_red_book"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lscdweb.com/ordering/cd_products.html |title=CD Products |work=lscdweb.com |accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audio format ==
The audio contained in a CD-DA consists of two-channel [[Signedness|signed]] 16-[[bit]] [[Linear pulse code modulation|Linear PCM]] sampled at [[44,100 Hz]].

=== Sample rate ===
{{Details|44.1 kHz}}
The [[sampling rate]] is adapted from that attained when recording digital audio on a [[PAL]] (or [[NTSC]]) [[videotape]] with a [[PCM adaptor]], an earlier way of storing digital audio.&lt;ref name="Auto45-4"/&gt; An audio CD can represent frequencies up to 22.05&amp;nbsp;kHz, the [[Nyquist frequency]] of the 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz sample rate.

The selection of the sample rate was based primarily on the need to reproduce the audible frequency range of 20–20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (20&amp;nbsp;kHz). The [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] states that a sampling rate of more than twice the maximum frequency of the signal to be recorded is needed, resulting in a required rate of at least 40&amp;nbsp;kHz. The exact sampling rate of 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz was inherited from a method of converting digital audio into an analog video signal for storage on [[U-matic|U-matic video tape]], which was the most affordable way to transfer data from the recording studio to the CD manufacturer at the time the CD specification was being developed. The device that converts an analog audio signal into PCM audio, which in turn is changed into an analog video signal is called a [[PCM adaptor]]. This technology could store six samples (three samples per stereo channel) in a single horizontal line. 60 field/s black and white video (not 59.94 color) was required, and in [[NTSC]] countries (USA/Japan) that video signal has 245 usable lines per field, which works out to be (245 * 60 * 3) = 44,100 samples/s/stereo channel. Similarly, [[PAL]] has 294 lines and 50 fields, which gives 44,100 samples/s/stereo channel. This system could store 14-bit samples with some error correction, or 16-bit samples with almost no error correction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

There was a long debate over the use of 14-bit (Philips) or 16-bit (Sony) [[Quantization (sound processing)|quantization]], and 44,056 or 44,100 samples/s (Sony) or approximately 44,000 samples/s (Philips). When the Sony/Philips task force designed the Compact Disc, Philips had already developed a 14-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter|D/A converter]] (DAC), but Sony insisted on 16-bit. In the end, 16 bits and 44.1 kilosamples per second prevailed. Philips found a way to produce 16-bit quality using its 14-bit DAC by using four times [[oversampling]].&lt;ref name=Immink /&gt;

=== Pre-emphasis ===
{{main|Emphasis (telecommunications)}}
Some CDs are mastered with pre-emphasis, an artificial boost of high audio frequencies. The pre-emphasis improves the apparent signal-to-noise ratio by making better use of the channel's dynamic range. On playback, the player applies a de-emphasis filter to restore the frequency response curve to an overall flat one. Pre-emphasis time constants are 50µs and 15µs (9.49&amp;nbsp;dB boost at 20&amp;nbsp;kHz), and a binary flag in the disc [[subcode]] instructs the player to apply de-emphasis filtering if appropriate. Playback of such discs in a computer or 'ripping' to [[WAV|wave files]] typically does not take into account the pre-emphasis, so such files play back with a distorted frequency response.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

== Storage capacity and playing time ==
The creators of the CD originally aimed at a playing time of 60&amp;nbsp;minutes with a disc diameter of 100&amp;nbsp;mm (Sony) or 115&amp;nbsp;mm (Philips).&lt;ref name=Immink2/&gt; Sony vice-president [[Norio Ohga]] suggested extending the capacity to 74 minutes to accommodate the recording of [[Wilhelm Furtwängler]] conducting [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] at the 1951 [[Bayreuth Festival]].&lt;ref name="PhilBeet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto45-6"/&gt; The additional 14-minute playing time subsequently required changing to a 120&amp;nbsp;mm disc. [[Kees Schouhamer Immink]], Philips' chief engineer, however, denies this, claiming that the increase was motivated by technical considerations, and that even after the increase in size, the Furtwängler recording would not have fit on one of the earliest CDs.&lt;ref name=Immink /&gt;&lt;ref name=Immink2 /&gt;

According to a ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'' interview,&lt;ref name="ferguscassidy"/&gt; the story is slightly more involved. In 1979, Philips owned [[PolyGram]], one of the world's largest distributors of music. PolyGram had set up a large experimental CD plant in [[Hannover]], Germany, which could produce huge numbers of CDs having a diameter of 115&amp;nbsp;mm. Sony did not yet have such a facility. If Sony had agreed on the 115-mm disc, Philips would have had a significant competitive edge in the market. The long playing time of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony imposed by [[Norio Ohga|Ohga]] was used to push Philips to accept 120&amp;nbsp;mm, so that Philips' PolyGram lost its edge on disc fabrication.&lt;ref name="ferguscassidy"/&gt;

The 74-minute playing time of a CD, which is longer than the 22&amp;nbsp;minutes per side&lt;ref name="Auto45-7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Auto45-8"/&gt; typical of [[LP record|long-playing]] (LP) [[vinyl album]]s, was often used to the CD's advantage during the early years when CDs and LPs vied for commercial sales. CDs would often be released with one or more bonus tracks, enticing consumers to buy the CD for the extra material. However, attempts to combine double LPs onto one CD occasionally resulted in the opposite situation in which the CD would instead offer fewer tracks than the LP.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Playing times beyond 74&amp;nbsp;minutes are achieved by decreasing track pitch (the distance separating the track as it spirals the disc) in violation of strict ''Red Book'' standards. However, most players can still accommodate the more closely spaced data if it is still within ''Red Book'' tolerances.&lt;ref name="Auto45-9"/&gt; Current manufacturing processes allow an audio CD to contain up to 80 minutes (variable from one replication plant to another) without requiring the content creator to sign a waiver releasing the plant owner from responsibility if the CD produced is marginally or entirely unreadable by some playback equipment. In current practice, maximum CD playing time has crept higher by reducing minimum engineering tolerances.

This table shows the progression in the maximum duration of released audio CDs:

== Technical specifications ==

=== Data encoding ===
Each audio sample is a [[Signedness|signed]] 16-bit [[two's complement]] [[Integer (computer science)|integer]], with sample values ranging from −32768 to +32767. The source audio data is divided into frames, containing twelve [[Sampling (signal processing)|samples]] each (six left and right samples, alternating), for a total of 192 bits (24 bytes) of audio data per frame.

This stream of audio frames, as a whole, is then subjected to [[Cross-interleaved Reed–Solomon coding|CIRC]] encoding, which segments and rearranges the data and expands it with [[parity bit]]s in a way that allows occasional read errors to be detected and corrected. CIRC encoding also interleaves the audio frames throughout the disc over several consecutive frames so that the information will be more resistant to [[burst error]]s. Therefore, a physical frame on the disc will actually contain information from multiple logical audio frames. This process adds 64 bits of [[error correction]] data to each frame. After this, 8 bits of [[subcode]] or subchannel data are added to each of these encoded frames, which is used for control and addressing when playing the CD.

CIRC encoding plus the subcode byte generate 33-bytes long frames, called "channel-data" frames. These frames are then modulated through [[eight-to-fourteen modulation]] (EFM), where each 8-bit word is replaced with a corresponding 14-bit word designed to reduce the number of transitions between 0 and 1. This reduces the density of [[Compact disc#Physical details|physical pits]] on the disc and provides an additional degree of error tolerance. Three "merging" bits are added before each 14-bit word for disambiguation and synchronization. In total there are 33 × (14 + 3) = 561 bits. A 27-bit word (a 24-bit pattern plus 3 merging bits) is added to the beginning of each frame to assist with synchronization, so the reading device can locate frames easily. With this, a frame ends up containing 588 bits of "channel data" (which are decoded to only 192 bits music).

The frames of channel data are finally written to disc physically in the form of [[Compact disc#Physical details|pits and lands]], with each pit or land representing a series of zeroes, and with the transition points—the edge of each pit—representing 1.
A Red Book-compatible CD-R has pit-and-land-shaped spots on a layer of organic dye instead of actual pits and lands; a laser creates the spots by altering the reflective properties of the dye.

=== Data structure ===
[[File:Basic Illustration and mesures of a CD.png|thumb|This image of a [[CD-R]] demonstrates some of the visible features of an audio CD, including the lead-in, program area, and lead-out. A microscopic spiral of digital information begins near the disc's center and progresses toward the edge. The end of the data region and the lead-out can actually be anywhere, depending on how much data is recorded. Data-free areas of the disc and silent portions of the spiral reflect light differently, sometimes allowing track boundaries to be seen]]
The audio data stream in an audio CD is continuous, but has three parts. The main portion, which is further divided into playable audio tracks, is the ''program area''. This section is preceded by a ''lead-in'' track and followed by a ''lead-out'' track. The lead-in and lead-out tracks encode only silent audio, but all three sections contain [[subcode]] data streams.

The lead-in's subcode contains repeated copies of the disc's Table Of Contents (TOC), which provides an index of the start positions of the tracks in the program area and lead-out. The track positions are referenced by absolute [[timecode]], relative to the start of the program area, in MSF format: minutes, seconds, and fractional seconds called ''frames''. Each timecode frame is one seventy-fifth of a second, and corresponds to a block of 98 channel-data frames—ultimately, a block of 588 pairs of left and right audio samples. Timecode contained in the subchannel data allows the reading device to locate the region of the disc that corresponds to the timecode in the TOC. The TOC on discs is analogous to the [[partition table]] on [[hard drive]]s. Nonstandard or corrupted TOC records are abused as a form of [[CD/DVD copy protection]], in e.g. the [[key2Audio]] scheme.

==== Tracks ====
{{main|Track (CD)#Audio tracks}}
The largest entity on a CD is called a track. A CD can contain up to 99 tracks (including a data track for [[Mixed Mode CD|mixed mode discs]]). Each track can in turn have up to 100 indexes, though players which handle this feature are rarely found outside of [[pro audio]], particularly radio broadcasting{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}. The vast majority of songs are recorded under index 1, with the [[pre-gap]] being index 0. Sometimes [[hidden track]]s are placed at the end of the last track of the disc, often using index 2 or 3. This is also the case with some discs offering "101 sound effects", with 100 and 101 being indexed as two and three on track 99. The index, if used, is occasionally put on the track listing as a decimal part of the track number, such as 99.2 or 99.3. ([[Information Society (band)|Information Society]]'s ''[[Hack (album)|Hack]]'' was one of very few CD releases to do this, following a release with an equally obscure [[CD+G]] feature.) The track and index structure of the CD were carried forward to the [[DVD]] format as title and chapter, respectively.

Tracks, in turn, are divided into timecode frames (or sectors), which are further subdivided into channel-data frames.

==== Frames and timecode frames ====
{{main|Track (CD)#Sector structure}}
The smallest entity in a CD is a channel-data ''frame'', which consists of 33 bytes and contains six complete 16-bit stereo samples: 24 bytes for the audio (two bytes × two channels × six samples = 24 bytes), eight CIRC error-correction bytes, and one [[Compact Disc subcode|subcode]] byte. As described in the "Data encoding" section, after the EFM modulation the number of bits in a frame totals 588.

On a ''Red Book'' audio CD, data is addressed using the ''MSF scheme'', with [[timecode]]s expressed in minutes, seconds and another type of ''frames'' (mm:ss:ff), where one frame corresponds to 1/75th of a second of audio: 588 pairs of left and right samples. This timecode frame is distinct from the 33-byte channel-data frame described above, and is used for time display and positioning the reading laser. When editing and extracting CD audio, this timecode frame is the smallest addressable time interval for an audio CD; thus, track boundaries only occur on these frame boundaries. Each of these structures contains 98 channel-data frames, totaling 98 × 24 = 2,352 bytes of music. The CD is played at a speed of 75 frames (or sectors) per second, thus 44,100 samples or 176,400 bytes per second.

In the 1990s, [[CD-ROM]] and related [[ripping|Digital Audio Extraction]] (DAE) technology introduced the term ''[[CD-ROM#CD-ROM format|sector]]'' to refer to each timecode frame, with each sector being identified by a sequential [[integer]] number starting at zero, and with tracks aligned on sector boundaries. An audio CD sector corresponds to 2,352 bytes of decoded data. The ''Red Book'' does not refer to sectors, nor does it distinguish the corresponding sections of the disc's data stream except as "frames" in the MSF addressing scheme.

The following table shows the relation between tracks, timecode frames (sectors) and channel-data frames:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Track level
| colspan = 6 | Track N
|-
! Timecode frame or sector level
| colspan = 3 | Timecode frame or sector 1 (2,352 b of data)
| Timecode frame or sector 2 (2,352 b of data)
| ... 
|-
! Channel-data frame level
| Channel-data frame 1 (24 b of data)
| ... 
| Channel-data frame 98 (24 b of data)
| ... 
| ... 
|}

=== Bit rate ===
The audio [[bit rate]] for a ''Red Book'' audio CD is 1,411,200 [[bits per second]] or 176,400 [[bytes per second]]; 2 channels × 44,100 samples per second per channel × 16 bits per sample. Audio data coming in from a CD is contained in sectors, each sector being 2,352 bytes, and with 75 sectors containing 1 second of audio. For comparison, the bit rate of a "1×" [[CD-ROM]] is defined as 2,048 bytes per sector × 75 sectors per second = 153,600 bytes per second. The remaining 304 bytes in a sector are used for additional data error correction.

=== Data access from computers ===
Unlike on a [[DVD]] or [[CD-ROM]], there are no "[[computer file|file]]s" on a ''Red Book'' audio CD; there is only one continuous stream of [[LPCM]] audio data, and a parallel, smaller set of 8 [[subcode]] data streams. Computer [[operating system]]s, however, may provide access to an audio CD as if it contains files. For example, [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] represents the CD's Table of Contents as a set of [[Compact Disc Audio track]] (CDA) files, each file containing indexing information, not audio data.

In a process called [[ripping]], digital audio extraction software can be used to read CD-DA audio data and store it in files. Common [[audio file format]]s for this purpose include [[WAV]] and [[Audio Interchange File Format|AIFF]], which simply preface the LPCM data with a short [[header (computing)|header]]; [[FLAC]], [[Apple Lossless|ALAC]], and [[Windows Media Audio#Windows Media Audio Lossless|Windows Media Audio Lossless]], which compress the LPCM data in ways that conserve space yet allow it to be restored without any changes; and various [[lossy compression|lossy]], [[perceptual audio coder|perceptual coding]] formats like [[MP3]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], which modify and compress the audio data in ways that irreversibly change the audio, but that exploit features of human hearing to make the changes difficult to discern.

== Format variations ==
Recording publishers have created CDs that violate the ''Red Book'' standard. Some do so for the purpose of [[copy protection|copy prevention]], using systems like [[Copy Control]]. Some do so for extra features such as [[DualDisc]], which includes both a [[CD]] layer and a [[DVD]] layer whereby the CD layer is much thinner, 0.9&amp;nbsp;mm, than required by the ''Red Book'', which stipulates a nominal 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm, but at least 1.1&amp;nbsp;mm. Philips and many other companies have stated that including the Compact Disc Digital Audio logo on such non-conforming discs may constitute [[trademark]] infringement.

[[Super Audio CD]] was a standard published in 1999 that aimed to provide better audio quality in CDs, but it never became very popular. [[DVD Audio]], an advanced version of the audio CD, emerged in 1999.&lt;ref name="Auto45-12"/&gt; The format was designed to feature audio of higher fidelity. It applies a higher sampling rate and uses 650&amp;nbsp;nm lasers.

== Copyright issues ==
{{Main|Compact Disc and DVD copy protection}}
There have been moves by the [[recording industry]] to make audio CDs (Compact Disc Digital Audio) unplayable on computer [[CD-ROM]] drives, to prevent the copying of music. This is done by intentionally introducing errors onto the disc that the embedded circuits on most stand-alone audio players can automatically compensate for, but which may confuse CD-ROM drives. Consumer rights advocates as of October 2001 pushed to require warning labels on compact discs that do not conform to the official Compact Disc Digital Audio standard (often called the [[#Standard|Red Book]]) to inform consumers which discs do not permit full [[fair use]] of their content.

In 2005, [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]] was criticized when a copy protection mechanism known as [[Extended Copy Protection]] (XCP) used on some of their audio CDs automatically and surreptitiously installed copy-prevention software on computers (see [[2005 Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal]]). Such discs are not legally allowed to be called CDs or Compact Discs because they break the Red Book standard governing CDs, and Amazon.com for example describes them as "copy protected discs" rather than "compact discs" or "CDs".

'''John Derek Crozier''' (12 November 1917 – 3 April 2010), under the pseudonym '''"Crosaire"''', was the compiler of the "''[[The Irish Times|Irish Times]]'' crossword" from its inception in 1943 until his death.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/obituaries/2010/0410/1224268029901.html|title=A riddler wrapped up in an enigma (5,7)|date=10 April 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he was the sole compiler for 68 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/magazine/2011/1022/1224306043431.html |title=Carrying the Crossaire |work=The Irish Times |accessdate=2012-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the crossword itself became known as "the Crosaire" by [[metonymy]]. It is a [[cryptic crossword]], in contrast to the "Simplex crossword" which soon came to be published alongside it. Crozier's pseudonym "Crosaire" is a play on his own surname and ''crosaire'', the Irish for "crossroads".&lt;ref name="tribute"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://focal.ie/Search.aspx?term=crosaire|title=crosaire|work=[[Focal (lexicographical website)|Focal]]|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The Irish for "crossword" is the [[calque]] ''crosfhocal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://focal.ie/Search.aspx?term=crossword|title=crossword|work=[[Focal (lexicographical website)|Focal]]|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="fn"}} 

He retained an idiosyncratic approach to compilation; his crosswords never came to conform to the standards developed in Britain by "[[Derrick Somerset Macnutt|Ximenes]]". The day he died saw puzzle No 14,120 published;&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt; ''The Irish Times'' crossword editor estimated there were a year's worth of his puzzles remaining to be published.&lt;ref name="duncan"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0407/breaking29.html|title='Irish Times' crossword compiler dies|last=Duncan|first=Pamela|date=7 April 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in Dublin and educated at Castle Park [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] in [[Dalkey]] and [[Repton School]] in England.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; He graduated from [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in 1940.&lt;ref name="tribute"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Derek Crozier 1917–2010|last=Kernan|first=Lorna|author2=Sarah Crushell |author3=Irene Stevenson |date=29 April 2010|work=The Irish Times|page=3, Supplement "40 Crosswords Celebrating the work of Derek Crozier"}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in administration at the [[Guinness Brewery]] in [[St. James's Gate]].&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt; He was introduced to editor [[Bertie Smyllie]] at an ''Irish Times'' party in a Dublin pub on Christmas Eve 1942, where he mentioned his hobby of compiling crosswords.&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt; Smyllie commissioned him and the first ''Crosaire'' was printed on 13 March 1943.&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt; Initially it appeared weekly on Saturdays, with Wednesdays added in 1950, Tuesdays in 1955, and a daily puzzle from 1982.&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt;

In 1948 Crozier emigrated to [[Southern Rhodesia]], now [[Zimbabwe]], to work as a tobacco and maize farmer in Sinoia, now [[Chinhoyi]].&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt; He found farming difficult and the meagre income from his puzzles was important.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; In the [[Southern Rhodesian general election, 1962]], he stood for the [[United Federal Party]] in the [[Gwebi]] constituency, losing to [[Rhodesian Front]] candidate [[James Graham, 7th Duke of Montrose]]. From 1963 to 1989, he taught at St George's College in Salisbury, now [[Harare]].&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt; His puzzles were often delivered to Ireland through visitors from abroad to avoid the vagaries of the Zimbabwe postal system.&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt; He travelled to Dublin in 1993 for the 50th anniversary of his first puzzle, during which he appeared on ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]'' and at a forum for 400 fans chosen by lottery.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; He died at his home in [[Nyanga, Zimbabwe|Nyanga]], aged 92.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt; A memorial service was held at St George's College, attended by his three sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0410/1224268048623.html?via=rel|title=Memorial service in Zimbabwe for compiler of 'Irish Times' crosswords|last=Corcoran|first=Bill|date=10 April 2010|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roy Earle]] (using the pseudonym ''Mac An Iarla'') took over as the compiler of the Crosaire following Crozier's death, with his crosswords appearing between Monday, 24 October 2011 and Saturday, 9 June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/thecrosaireblog/2011/10/21/welcome-to-the-crosaire-blog/|title=Welcome to the Crosaire Blog|accessdate=2012-02-17 | work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Earle|first=Roy|title=Explanations: No. 14802 – Saturday, 9 Jun 2012|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/thecrosaireblog/2012/06/10/explanations-no-14802-saturday-9-jun-2012/|publisher=Irish Times|accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Crosaire has since been compiled by "Crossheir."

A '''development director''' or '''director of development''' is the senior fundraising manager of a [[non-profit organization]], [[company (law)|company]], or [[corporation]]. The position works closely with a [[chief financial officer]] (CFO) or [[treasurer]]. A Director of Development is chiefly responsible for bringing in revenue streams to a non-profit (grants, donations, special events), and a CFO is responsible for the fiscal management of the organization. A CFO is rarely assigned to write grant narratives, but may oversee the budget section of a grant application or a fiscal report for a grant. Some larger organizations (especially those that have large government grants) have a grants manager as well as a grant writer/Director of Development.  A Grants Manager assists the CFO with grant reports and/or grant related accounting. A development director is usually [[Remuneration|remunerated]] for his or her work,&lt;ref&gt;

|title=What's A Good Director Of Development Worth? 
|accessdate=2008-08-23 
|work=Tony Poderis
|publisher=Non-profit fundraising Resource}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and in best practices for [[nonprofit organization]]s, development directors earn salaries.  Commissions are still considered unethical by professional organizations such as the Grant Professionals Association (GPA) and the [[Association of Fundraising Professionals]] (AFP), but the practice of commission based remuneration is growing, particularly in the current economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grantprofessionals.org/ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of a development director is to develop and implement a strategic plan to raise vital funds for their organization in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.The development director's primary responsibility, however, is to oversee fundraising, rather than to actually raise money. This person may write grants, research foundations and corporations, and oversee or implement other fundraising strategies, but she or he works mostly behind the scenes, establishing a structure for effective fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The development director may also be responsible for additional financial responsibilities, including developing business plans or strategic plans in collaboration with the board for the future of the organization. The development director is usually accountable to the [[Executive Director]], [[Chief Operating Officer]], or CFO. The board often offers suggestions and ideas about how to increase the fundraising, including contacts, and the development director chooses how to implement these ideas to maximize inflow while keeping outflow at a minimum and keeping donors happy. A strong board often has a development/fundraising committee, makes personal donations to the non-profit, and assists with annual campaigns.

The development director has an outreach role in the organization and often fulfills a [[public relations|public affairs]] role in addition to office-based work. Development directors motivate and satisfy donors, board members, staff and even the press. Many Directors of Development assist with communications such a non-profits annual report, development and communications section of website, newsletters, and donor databases.

The structure of a Development Department varies greatly. A Director of Development may or may not have staff reporting to him/her, depending on the size of the organization. Some large non-profits have a development team including a Grant Writer, donor database specialist, Grants Manager, Special Events Coordinator, Communications staff, and Planning Giving staff. In some cases, an Executive Director serves as the lead grant writer of an organization. Some non-profits hire development staff on a part-time or consultant basis, instead of full-time.

Median pay for Development Directors in the U.S. is in the neighborhood of $62,000 annually. Total cash compensation ranges from $40,000 to $100,000; the final number includes potential for approximately $10,000 each from bonuses and profit sharing in exceptional cases. While geography and years of experience impact pay for this group, the organization is the most influential factor. Earnings for this group are mostly affected by the particular organization, followed by the particular city and tenure.&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=2018-01-31 
|publisher=Payscale Human Resource}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

As the title suggests, the development director is concerned with the growth of the organization. This includes staff, membership, budget, company assets, and all other company resources, to help make the best use of them and maximize the organization's profitability and profile.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Drummond Tobacco Company''' was an American [[tobacco]] company in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum"&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1361816 Tobacco Shipping Crate], [[National Museum of American History]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The company was founded in 1873, when it started making [[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield cigarettes]].&lt;ref name="nationalmuseum"/&gt; Its headquarters in St. Louis was designed by architect [[Isaac S. Taylor]] in 1885. The company later also produced Horseshoe brand chewing tobacco. It was acquired by the [[American Tobacco Company]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1898/09/24/archives/tobacco-companies-united-the-trust-buys-out-the-drummond-company-of.html TOBACCO COMPANIES UNITED.; The Trust Buys Out the Drummond Company of St. Louis for Ten Million Dollars.], ''The New York Times'', September 24, 1898&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[member states of the European Union]] are bound to decrease their [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. For example, the EU [[climate and energy]] package requires member states to improve their energy efficiency by 20%, increase -renewable energy production by 20% and reduce their emissions by 20%. With about 40% of CO2 emissions heating, cooling and hot water production in buildings is one of the largest greenhouse gas producers.&lt;ref&gt;Lechner, Norbert. Heating, cooling, lighting: Sustainable design methods for architects. John wiley &amp; sons, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the building sector has the largest potential for energy savings. In their effort to lead a change towards greater energy efficiency and a reduction of greenhouse gas, many companies, cities and municipalities are in the process of developing [[low carbon]] action plans.&lt;ref&gt;Baeumler, Axel, Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, and Shomik Mehndiratta, eds. Sustainable low-carbon city development in China. World Bank Publications, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broto, Vanesa Castán, and Harriet Bulkeley. "A survey of urban climate change experiments in 100 cities." Global Environmental Change 23.1 (2013): 92-102.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the costs for developing optimal action plans and their continuous monitoring and optimization are very high, thus, often hindered by the tense financial situation, especially of cities and municipalities. With significant economic and environmental downsides; the consequences are additional costs due to the non-compliance to the national and EU emission goals and untapped energy saving potential.

ECOCITIES is an energy optimization system for building portfolios combining and extending the benefits of [[Energy Management Software]] (EMS), [[Computer-aided facility management|Computer-aided Facility Management]] (CAFM) software and building portfolio management software. It integrates building administration and monitoring, energy accounting and building portfolio optimization. Thereby, it supports the definition of low carbon action plans in terms of environmental impact (e.g., [[carbon footprint]], [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]]) and financial impact (e.g., investment costs, running, costs). The system considers the following options for each building and the resulting (inter-) dependencies:
* energy-efficient building configurations (e.g., the compatibility of building components and its contribution to the energy efficiency level), 
* energy used at the production and distribution of building components (i.e., gray energy),
* [[environmental impact]] (e.g., [[CO2 emissions]]),
* financial constraints, such as (governmental) funding and limited long term loans,
* legal constraints, e.g., [[building codes]], national and international standards,
* energy consumption for the operation of buildings, i.e., heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ([[HVAC]]) as well as the electricity demand,
* energy production, storage and load shifting between buildings in combination with [[renewable energy production]] ([[solar PV]] and thermal, [[Micro combined heat and power]]) and conversion.
* energy flows between a building’s on-site networks (Heating/Cooling and low voltage networks), the micro networks on neighborhood level and the city-wide energy networks ([[district heating]] and [[district cooling]] networks, mid-voltage distribution networks), 
* local typology (position of buildings, energy networks).

ECOCITIES calculates all energy- and cost-efficient development scenarios, visualizes them on the screen and allows decision makers to interactively explore the consequences of their actions (e.g., what are the citywide costs and the corresponding CO2 reductions of introducing a neighborhood-scale combined heat and power plant). ECOCITIES is an enabler for the realization of energy goals and provides synergies with existing endeavors of achieving national and European energy goals. On an operational level, ECOCITIES supports the following processes:
* Administration and integrated optimization of the entire building portfolio.
* Energy accounting and monitoring for all buildings.
* Identification, evaluation and definition of energy efficiency strategies (low carbon action plans).
* Continuous monitoring, review and optimization of energy efficiency strategies (low carbon action plans).
* Ensure the alignment of individual initiatives with the overall energy strategy of the company/city, e.g., planning the cost- and energy efficient integration of new or refurbished single buildings, groups of buildings or entire neighborhoods into a new or existing energy efficiency strategy.
* Continuous monitoring of the performance related to the contribution to national and European energy goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1897">'''Emilio Bozzi''' was an [[Italy|Italian]] businessman, known for his [[bicycle]] manufacturing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legnano: The Warrior’s Wheels|url=http://www.ebykr.com/2007/05/11/legnano-the-warriors-wheels/|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established the '''Emilio Bozzi &amp; Co.''' bicycle manufacturer in [[Milano]] (1908), the first model being the "Aurora".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicrendezvous.com/Italy/Legnano/Legnano_history.htm The Legnano legend]&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, he had the rights to the Turinese [[Frejus]] bicycle brand.  With the son of [[Franco Tosi]], who had some [[patent]]s from the English [[Wolseley Motors#Wolseley Italy or Wolsit|Wolsit]] brand, his company made the ''Ciclomotore Wolsit'' (1910–14), the rights to which was sold to [[NSU Motorenwerke AG]] (1932).

They renamed the company '''Legnano''' (the name of Bozzi's hometown) using a swordlifting legendary [[warrior]] ([[Alberto da Giussano]]) symbol painted by the cycler [[Alfredo Binda]], based on the [[Battle of Legnano]].  Along with Frejus they had immediate racing success with cyclists as [[Eberardo Pavesi]] (being the manager), [[Alfredo Binda]] (1922), [[Gino Bartali]] (1936), [[Fausto Coppi]] (1939), [[Ferdinand Kübler]] (1950)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frejus 1950 and 1951 Brochure|url=http://classicrendezvous.com/Italy/Frejus/Brochures_50_51.htm|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Ercole Baldini]] (1956) in the [[Giro d'Italia]], [[Tour de France]] and other races until 1965.  
The company also made [[moped]]s (1954–68), while the bicycle business was acquired by the main rival [[Bianchi (motorcycles)|Bianchi]].

'''Energy brokers''' assist clients in procuring [[electric]] or [[natural gas]] from energy wholesalers/suppliers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market.  It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day.  In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted.  An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers.  An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers.  Under some State Laws they use the term "Suppliers" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and [[Smart Grid aggregator|aggregator]]s, however there are very important differences between them all.

Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you.  They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier.

==Product and services==
Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), [[ISO 50001]], [[ISO 14001]], [[Energy Performance Certificate]]s and [[Display Energy Certificate]]s.
Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting.

Additional services such as arranging a [[power purchase agreement]], energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by [[energy consultants]].

==Who do energy brokers serve?==
In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the [[UK]], and some countries in [[Europe]], the entire market is deregulated.

==Fees==
Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates.  If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee is usually included in the rate the customer pays.    Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services.

==Consulting==
{{main|Energy consulting}}
Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer.  Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company.  There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.&lt;ref name="DEC-guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings – A guide to display energy certificates and advisory reports for public buildings |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/display-energy-certificates-and-advisory-reports-for-public-buildings |publisher=[[Department for Communities and Local Government]] |accessdate=19 September 2013 |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ. do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps].

'''Entertainment management''' is a relatively new [[business management]] discipline that is increasingly being taught as a [[Bachelor of Arts degree]]. Entertainment management courses aim to provide graduates with appropriate knowledge and skills to progress into management careers within the [[show business|entertainment sector]], managing facilities such as sport events, theme parks, theaters, cinemas, live music venues, museums, art galleries, broadcast media companies and night clubs.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The [[Lubin School of Business]] at [[Pace University]] offers a [[Bachelor of Business Administration|BBA]] degree in [[management]] with a concentration in arts and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pace.edu/lubin/arts-and-entertainment-bba&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of master's-level programs have emerged recently, including [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon University's]] [[Heinz College|Master of Entertainment Industry Management]] – which offers students with undergraduate degrees in the film and television the opportunity to refocus their education on the management dimension of the work, or Northwestern University's [http://www.creative.northwestern.edu Master of Science in Leadership for Creative Enterprises] program, which offers students with backgrounds in visual, performing, or interactive arts with management and entrepreneurial skills.

Growth in these courses has been linked with growth in both the creative and cultural industries. This growth is linked to increased [[consumer expenditure]] on recreation and entertainment activities. The result is a population assigning greater importance to the free time they have and a consequential willingness to spend more of their income on the 'experience' economy.

[[File:GHS-pictogram-exclam.svg|thumb|The [[GHS hazard pictograms|pictogram]] for harmful substances of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.]]

The '''Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals''' ('''GHS''') is an internationally agreed-upon standard managed by the [[United Nations]] that was set up to replace the assortment of hazardous material classification and labelling schemes previously used around the world. Core elements of the GHS include standardized hazard testing criteria, universal warning pictograms, and harmonized safety data sheets which provide users of dangerous goods with a host of information. The system acts as a complement to the [[UN number|UN Numbered]] system of regulated hazmat transport. Implementation is managed through the [[United Nations Secretariat|UN Secretariat]]. Although adoption has taken time, as of 2017, the system has been enacted to significant extents in most major countries of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/implementation_e.html|title=GHS implementation -  Transport - UNECE|website=www.unece.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the [[European Union]], which has implemented the United Nations' GHS into EU law as the [[CLP Regulation]], and United States [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] standards.

==History==
Before the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) was created and implemented, there were many different regulations on hazard classification in use in different countries, resulting in multiple standards, classifications and labels for the same hazard. Given the $1.7 trillion per year international trade in chemicals requiring hazard classification, the cost of compliance with multiple systems of classification and labeling is significant. Developing a worldwide standard accepted as an alternative to local and regional systems presented an opportunity to reduce cost and improve compliance. &lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Guide to The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals |url=https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghsguideoct05.pdf |website=Occupational Safety and Health Administration, United States of America |publisher=OSHA, U.S.A. |accessdate=15 November 2018 |language=English (US) |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GHS development began at the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development by the United Nations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Government HSE website|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/chemical-classification/index.htm|author=Health and Safety Executive|publisher=UK Government|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; also called [[Earth Summit (1992)]] when the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), various governments and other stakeholders agreed that "A globally harmonized hazard classification and compatible labelling system, including [[material safety data sheets]] and easily understandable [[symbols]], should be available if feasible, by the year 2000".&lt;ref name=visual&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHS: What's Next? {{!}} Visual.ly|url = http://visual.ly/ghs-whats-next|website = visual.ly|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The universal standard for all countries was to replace all the diverse classification systems; however, it is not a compulsory provision of any treaty. The GHS provides a common infrastructure for participating countries to use when implementing a hazard classification and [[Hazard Communication Standard]].&lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide" /&gt;

==Hazard classification==
The GHS classification system is a complex system with data obtained from tests, literature, and practical experience.

The main elements of the hazard classification criteria are summarized below:

===Physical hazards===
Substances or articles are assigned to 9 different [[hazard class]]es largely based on the [[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods|United Nations Dangerous Goods System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods -  Model Regulations, Rev. 19 Volume I] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117032522/http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/unrec/rev19/19files_e.html |date=November 17, 2016 }} 2015, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, retrieved 6 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|59–60}} Additions and changes have been necessary since the scope of the GHS includes all target audiences.
# '''[[Explosives]]''', which are assigned to one of six subcategories depending on the type of hazard they present, as used in the UN Dangerous Goods System.
# '''Gases''' are category 1 [[flammable]] if they start to flame in a range in air at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa. Category 2 is Non flammable and non toxic gases, and category 3 is toxic gases. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the test or calculation method.
# A '''[[flammable liquid]]''' is a liquid with a [[flash point]] of not more than 93&amp;nbsp;°C.  Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of four hazard categories on the basis of the flash point and [[boiling point]]. A pyrophoric liquid is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.3.
# A '''[[flammable solids|flammable solid]]''' is one that is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction.  Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into &lt;br&gt;• flammable solids, &lt;br&gt;• polymerizing substances 
# '''[[self-reactive substance|self-reactive substances]]''', are thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly [[exothermic]] thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air), other than materials classified as explosive, [[organic peroxide]]s or as [[oxidizing]].
# '''[[pyrophoric substance|pyrophoric substance]]''' more coloquially described as spontaneously combusting substances are those solids or liquids that even in small quantities are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.2. 
# '''[[Self-heating substance|Self-heating substances]]''' A self-heating solids or liquids, other than a [[pyrophoric]] substance, is one which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable.
# '''Oxidizing substances and organic [[peroxide]]s ''' contain &lt;br&gt;• category 1: oxidizing substances and&lt;br&gt;• category 2: organic peroxides, organic liquids or solids that contain the bivalent -O-O- structure and may be considered a derivative of [[hydrogen peroxide]], where one or both of the [[hydrogen]] [[atoms]] have been replaced by [[Substituent|organic radicals]]. The term also includes organic peroxide formulations (mixtures). &lt;br&gt;Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of seven 'Types', A to G, on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test Series A to H.
#'''[[Toxic]] and [[infectious]] substances'''
#'''[[Radioactive]] substances''' 
# '''Substances [[corrosive]] to metal''' are substances or mixtures that by chemical action will materially damage or even destroy metals. These substances or mixtures are classified in a single hazard category on the basis of tests (Steel: ISO 9328 (II): 1991 - Steel type P235; Aluminum: ASTM G31-72 (1990) - non-clad types 7075-T6 or AZ5GU-T66). The GHS criteria are a [[corrosion]] rate on [[steel]] or [[aluminum]] surfaces exceeding 6.25&amp;nbsp;mm per year at a test temperature of 55&amp;nbsp;°C.
#'''Miscellaneous''' dangerous substances which includes environmentally dangerous substances

===Health hazards===
* '''[[Acute toxicity]]''' includes five GHS categories from which the appropriate elements relevant to transport, consumer, worker and environment protection can be selected. Substances are assigned to one of the five [[toxicity]] categories on the basis of LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (oral, dermal) or LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;  (inhalation).
* '''Skin corrosion''' means the production of irreversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized corrosion category.
* '''[[Skin irritation]]''' means the production of reversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single [[irritation|irritant]] category. For those authorities, such as [[pesticide]] regulators, wanting more than one designation for skin irritation, an additional mild irritant category is provided.
* '''Serious eye damage''' means the production of tissue damage in the eye, or serious physical decay of vision, following application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which is not fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized category.
* '''Eye irritation''' means changes in the eye following the application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which are fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized hazard category.  For authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for eye irritation, one of two subcategories can be selected, depending on whether the effects are reversible in 21 or 7 days.
* '''Respiratory sensitizer''' means a substance that induces [[hypersensitivity]] of the airways following inhalation of the substance. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category.
* '''Skin sensitizer''' means a substance that will induce an allergic response following skin contact. The definition for "skin [[wikt:sensitizer|sensitizer]]" is equivalent to "contact sensitizer". Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category.
* '''Germ cell mutagenicity''' means an agent giving rise to an increased occurrence of [[mutations]] in populations of cells and/or organisms. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories.
* '''Carcinogenicity''' means a chemical substance or a mixture of chemical substances that induce [[cancer]] or increase its incidence. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories.
* '''[[Reproductive toxicity]]''' includes adverse effects on sexual function and [[fertility]] in adult males and females, as well as [[developmental toxicity]] in offspring.  Substances and mixtures with reproductive and/or developmental effects are assigned to one of two hazard categories, 'known or presumed' and 'suspected'. Category 1 has two subcategories for reproductive and developmental effects. Materials which cause concern for the health of breastfed children have a separate category: effects on or via [[Lactation]].
* '''[[Specific target organ toxicity]] (STOT) ''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/danger/publi/ghs/ghs_rev02/English/03e_part3.pdf|title=Part 3 Health Hazards| work=Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS)| version=Second revised edition|publisher=United Nations| accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; category distinguishes between single and repeated exposure for [[Target Organ]] Effects.  All significant health effects, not otherwise specifically included in the GHS, that can impair function, both reversible and irreversible, immediate and/or delayed are included in the non-lethal target organ/systemic toxicity class (TOST). Narcotic effects and respiratory tract irritation are considered to be target organ systemic effects following a single exposure.  Substances and mixtures of the single exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories.  Substances and mixtures of the repeated exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories.
* '''Aspiration hazard''' includes severe acute effects such as [[chemical pneumonia]], varying degrees of [[pulmonary injury]] or death following [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]]. Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and [[lower respiratory system]].  Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories this hazard class on the basis of [[viscosity]].

===Environmental hazards===

* '''Acute [[aquatic toxicity]]''' means the intrinsic property of a material of causing injury to an [[aquatic organism]] in a short-term exposure. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three toxicity categories on the basis of acute toxicity data: LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ([[fish]]) or EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ([[crustacean]]) or ErC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (for [[algae]] or other [[aquatic plants]]). In some regulatory systems these acute toxicity categories may be subdivided or extended for certain sectors.
* '''Chronic aquatic toxicity''' means the potential or actual properties of a material to cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms during exposures that are determined in relation to the lifecycle of the organism. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of four toxicity categories on the basis of acute data and environmental fate data:  LC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (fish) or EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (crustacea) or ErC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (for algae or other aquatic plants) and [[Environmental degradation|degradation]] or [[bioaccumulation]].

===Classification of mixtures===

The GHS approach to the classification of mixtures for health and environmental hazards is also complex.  It uses a tiered approach and is dependent upon the amount of information available for the mixture itself and for its components. Principles that have been developed for the classification of mixtures, drawing on existing systems such as the [[European Union]] (EU) system for classification of preparations laid down in [[Directive 1999/45/EC]].  The process for the classification of mixtures is based on the following steps:

# Where [[toxicological]] or [[ecotoxicological]] test data are available for the mixture itself, the classification of the mixture will be based on that data;
# Where test data are not available for the mixture itself, then the appropriate [[bridging principles]] should be applied, which uses test data for components and/or similar mixtures;
# If (1) test data are not available for the mixture itself, and (2) the bridging principles cannot be applied, then use the calculation or cutoff values described in the specific endpoint to classify the mixture.

==Testing requirements==

The GHS document does not include testing requirements for substances or mixtures.  In fact, one of the main goals of the GHS is to reduce the need for animal testing.  The GHS criteria for determining health and environmental hazards are test method neutral, allowing different approaches as long as they are scientifically sound and validated according to international procedures and criteria already referred to in existing systems.  Test data already generated for the classification of chemicals under existing systems should be accepted when classifying these chemicals under the GHS, thereby avoiding duplicative testing and the unnecessary use of test animals.  The GHS physical hazard criteria are linked to specific [[UN test methods]].  It is assumed that mixtures will be tested for physical hazards.

==Hazard communication==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Per GHS, hazards need to be communicated:{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}
* in more than one form (for example, placards, labels or SDS’s).
* with [[GHS hazard statements|hazard statements]] and [[GHS precautionary statements|precautionary statements]].
* in an easily comprehensible and standardized manner.
* consistent with other statements to reduce confusion.
* taking into account all existing research and any new evidence.

Comprehensibility is challenging for a single culture and language, so global harmonization is complex. The [[GHS Purple Book]] includes a comprehensibility-testing instrument in Annex 6. Factors that were considered in developing the GHS communication tools include:{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}
* Different philosophies in existing systems on how and what should be communicated;
* Language differences around the world;
* Ability to translate phrases meaningfully;
* Ability to understand and appropriately respond to [[pictograms]].

===GHS label elements===
[[File:GHS-pictogram-silhouette.svg|thumb|The symbol for substances hazardous to the human health as implemented by the GHS.]]

The standardized label elements included in the GHS are:
* '''Symbols''' ([[GHS hazard pictograms]]): Convey [[health]], physical and [[Natural environment|environmental]] hazard information, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category.  Pictograms include the harmonized hazard symbols plus other graphic elements, such as borders, background patterns or cozers and substances which have target organ toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = GHS pictograms -  Transport - UNECE|url = http://www.unece.org/trans/danger/publi/ghs/pictograms.html|website = www.unece.org|accessdate = 2015-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, harmful chemicals and irritants are marked with an [[exclamation mark]], replacing the European [[saltire]]. Pictograms will have a black symbol on a white background with a red diamond frame.  For transport, pictograms will have the background, symbol and colors currently used in the ''[[UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods]]''. Where a [[transport pictogram]] appears, the GHS pictogram for the same hazard should not appear.
* '''Signal words''':  "Danger" or "Warning" will be used to emphasize hazards and indicate the relative level of severity of the hazard, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category.  Some lower level hazard categories do not use signal words. Only one signal word corresponding to the class of the most severe hazard should be used on a label.
* '''[[GHS hazard statement]]''': Standard phrases assigned to a [[hazard class]] and category that describe the nature of the hazard.  An appropriate statement for each GHS hazard should be included on the label for products possessing more than one hazard.

The additional label elements included in the GHS are:
* '''[[GHS precautionary statements]]''': Measures to minimize or prevent [[adverse effects]].  There are four types of precautionary statements covering: prevention, [[Chemical accidents|response in cases of accidental spillage or exposure]], storage, and disposal. The precautionary statements have been linked to each GHS hazard statement and type of hazard.
* '''[[Product identifier]]''' (ingredient disclosure): Name or number used for a hazardous product on a label or in the SDS.  The GHS label for a substance should include the [[chemical identity]] of the substance.  For mixtures, the label should include the chemical identities of all ingredients that contribute to acute toxicity, skin corrosion or serious eye damage, germ cell mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, skin or respiratory sensitization, or Systemic Target Organ Systemic (STOT), when these hazards appear on the label.
* '''Supplier identification''': The name, address and telephone number should be provided on the label.
* '''Supplemental information''': Non-harmonized information on the container of a hazardous product that is not required or specified under the GHS.  Supplemental information may be used to provide further detail that does not contradict or cast doubt on the validity of the standardized hazard information.

===GHS label format===

The GHS includes directions for application of the hazard communication elements on the label. In particular, it specifies for each hazard, and for each class within the hazard, what signal word, [[pictogram]], and hazard statement should be used. The GHS hazard pictograms, signal words and hazard statements should be located together on the label. The actual label format or layout is not specified in the GHS. National authorities may choose to specify where information should appear on the label or allow supplier discretion.  There has been discussion about the size of GHS pictograms and that a GHS pictogram might be confused with a transport pictogram or "diamond". Transport pictograms are different in appearance than the GHS pictograms. Annex 7 of the Purple Book explains how the GHS pictograms are expected to be proportional to the size of the label text so that generally the GHS pictograms would be smaller than the transport pictograms.{{citation needed||date=February 2017}}

===Safety data sheet===

The [[safety data sheet]] or SDS (The GHS dropped the word "material" from material safety data sheet in its final revisions) is specifically aimed at use in the workplace. It should provide comprehensive information about the chemical product that allows employers and workers to obtain concise, relevant and accurate information in perspective to the hazards, uses and [[risk management]] of the chemical product in the workplace. While there were some differences in existing industry recommendations and country specific requirements, there was agreement on a 16 section SDS to include the following headings in the order specified:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlineehssupply.com/2017/02/25/understanding-ghs-sds-sections/|title=Understanding The GHS SDS Sections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Identification
# Hazard(s) identification
# Composition/ information on ingredients
# [[First-aid]] measures
# Fire-fighting measures
# [[Chemical accidents|Accidental release measures]]
# Handling and storage
# Exposure control/ personal protection
# Physical and chemical properties
# [[chemical stability]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]
# Toxicological information
# Ecological information
# Disposal considerations
# Transport information
# Regulatory information
# Other information

The primary difference between the GHS and the international industry recommendations is that sections 2 and 3 have been reversed in order.  The GHS SDS headings, sequence and content are similar to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[European Union]] and [[ANSI]] MSDS/SDS requirements.  The SDS should provide a clear description of the data used to identify the hazards.  A table comparing the content and format of a MSDS/SDS versus the GHS SDS is provided in Appendix A of the U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) GHS guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals - GHS|url = https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html#3.0|website = www.osha.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-18|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702005153/http://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghs.html#3.0|archivedate = 2007-07-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==

Current training procedures for [[Hazard Communication]] in the United States are more detailed than the GHS training recommendations.&lt;ref name="OSHA GHS Guide" /&gt; Educating employees on the updated chemical and product classifications and related pictograms, signal words, hazard statements and precautionary measures at the level of detail by the national authority represents the greatest training challenge.  Training will be a key component of the overall GHS approach and should incorporate information as it is introduced into the workplace.  Employees and [[emergency responders]] will need to be trained on all new program elements, from hazard statements to pictograms. Bear in mind, if the importation of products using only GHS labeling is permitted prior to its adoption in the United States and Canada, employers may need to begin employee training may need to begin earlier than expected.

==Implementation==

The [[United Nations]] goal was broad international adoption, and as of 2017, GHS has been adopted to varying degrees in nearly all major countries.

'''PT Gudang Garam Tbk.''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] for "salt warehouse") is one of Indonesia's leading ''[[kretek]]'' (clove cigarette) brands/manufacturers. It is Indonesia's second-largest tobacco manufacturer, with a market share of about 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zulkifar|first1=Muhammad|title=As the Rest of the World Quits, Indonesia’s Smokers Increase|url=https://www.asiasentinel.com/econ-business/indonesia-smokers-increase/|accessdate=11 April 2018|publisher=Asia Sentinel|date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was founded on 26 June 1958 by Tjoa Ing Hwie, who changed his name to [[Surya Wonowidjojo]]. In 1984, control of the company was passed to Wonowidjojo's son, [[Rachman Halim]], who subsequently became the richest man in Indonesia. Halim headed the company until his death at the age of 60 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghosh|first1=Arijit|title=Made billions from clove cigarettes|url=http://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20080729/282020438071698|accessdate=13 April 2018|agency=Bloomberg|publisher=Montreal Gazette|date=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early Years===
Wonowidjojo was in his 20s when his uncle offered him a job working with tobacco and sauce at his ''[[kretek]]'' factory Cap 93. Cap 93 was one of the most famous ''kretek'' brands in [[East Java]]. Hard work and diligence were rewarded by promotion to Head of Tobacco and Sauce and eventually led to Wonowidjojo becoming a [[company director]].

Wonowidjojo left Cap 93 in 1956 taking 50 employees with him. He started buying land and raw materials in [[Kediri (city)|Kediri]] and soon began producing his own ''[[klobot]] kretek'', which he marketed under the brand name ''Inghwie''. Two years later he renamed and registered his company as ''Pabrik Rokok Tjap Gudang Garam''.

He chose the name Gudang Garam after a dream about the old salt warehouse which stood opposite Cap 93. Sarman, one of the original 50 employees who had followed him when he quit Cap 93, suggested he put a picture of the warehouse on every packet of his ''kretek'' for good luck. Wonowidjojo considered this a good idea and asked Sarman to design the [[logo]], commenting: "We should leave two doors open, two half-opened and one closed. If all the doors were closed, we would feel that everything had already been achieved."&lt;ref name="Hanusz2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Hanusz|title=Kretek: The Culture and Heritage of Indonesia's Clove Cigarettes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoDaAAAAMAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Equinox Pub.|isbn=978-979-95898-0-4|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gudang Garam grew rapidly and by the end of 1958 it had 500 employees producing over 50 million kretek annually. By 1966, after only eight years in production, Gudang Garam had grown to be the largest ''kretek'' factory in Indonesia with an annual production of 472 million sticks. Consumers have noted Gudang Garam's, particularly the Inghwies, similar smell to alcoholic beverages.

By 1969, Gudang Garam was producing 864 million sticks a year and was indisputably the largest ''kretek'' producer in Indonesia and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]].

In 1979, Wonowidjojo completely renovated Gudang Garam's production system, ordered thirty rolling machines and developed a new formula for his machine-made ''kretek''.

Rival companies tried to discredit the brand by claiming its contents included marijuana in addition to cloves and tobacco. The company has the distinction of being the largest single employer in Indonesia and Taiwan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39657">[[File:UNCAC 1.png|thumb|Chapter V of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (2003) makes clear that Asset Recovery is an international priority in the fight against corruption]]

'''International asset recovery''' is any effort by governments to repatriate the proceeds of corruption hidden in foreign jurisdictions. Such assets may include monies in bank accounts, real estate, vehicles, arts and artifacts, and precious metals. As defined under the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], asset recovery refers to recovering the proceeds of corruption, rather than broader terms such as [[confiscation|asset confiscation]] or [[asset forfeiture]] which refer to recovering the proceeds or instrumentalities of crime in general.

Often used to emphasize the "multi-jurisdictional" or cross-border aspects of a corruption investigation, international asset recovery includes numerous processes such as the tracing, freezing, confiscation, and repatriation of proceeds stored in foreign jurisdictions, thus "making it one of the most complex projects in the field of law".&lt;ref name="u4"&gt;{{cite|author= Smith, Jack; Pieth, Mark; Jorge, Guillermo|title=The Recovery of Stolen Assets: A Fundamental Principle of the UN Convention against Corruption|work=U4Brief|publisher=Chr. Michelsen Institute (CMI) – U4|date=February 2007|issue=2|url=http://www.repatriationgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/U4-Brief.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even considering the difficulties present, Africa specialist Daniel Scher counters that international asset recovery's "potential rewards in developing countries make it a highly attractive undertaking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scher|first1=Daniel|title=Asset Recovery|journal=African Security Review|date=January 2005|volume=14|issue=4|pages=17–26|doi=10.1080/10246029.2005.9627584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite domestic legislation in some countries allowing for the confiscation and forfeiture of proceeds of corruption, it is improvements in finance, transportation, and communications technologies in the 20th century that have made it easier for corrupt leaders and other "[[politically exposed person]]s" to conceal massive amounts of stolen wealth in [[offshore financial centers]].

By taking advantage of differences in legal systems, the high costs in coordinating investigations, lack of international cooperation, and [[bank secrecy]] in some recipient countries, corrupt officials have been able to preserve much of their loot overseas.

== Social impact ==
Recovering stolen assets is important for a variety of reasons. According to the [[World Bank]], the cross-border flow of proceeds from criminal activity, corruption and tax evasion is estimated between US$1–1.6 trillion per year—half of this amount is looted from developing and transition economies.&lt;ref name="worldbankquote"&gt;[http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/be3d0de7-cd8c-11dc-b471-db7db47931e5.58 Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative: Challenges, Opportunities, and Action Plan, additional text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175435/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/be3d0de7-cd8c-11dc-b471-db7db47931e5.58 |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; US $20–40 billion of this flow originated in bribes to public officials from developing and transition countries. A 2005 report by the Commission for Africa cites a European Commission estimate that "stolen African assets equivalent to more than half of the continent's external debt are held in foreign banks accounts".&lt;ref name="halfafrica"&gt;[http://www.commissionforafrica.org/english/report/thereport/english/11-03-05_cr_report.pdf - Report of the Commission for Africa Report- Our Common Interest], p.152&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by the World Bank in 2004, "corruption is... the single greatest obstacle to economic and social development. Corruption undermines development by distorting the rule of law and weakening the institutional foundation on which economic growth depends. The harmful effects of corruption are especially severe on the world's poorest, who are most reliant on the provision of public services, and are least capable of paying the extra costs associated with fraud and corruption".&lt;ref name=worldbankcit&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPUBLICSECTORANDGOVERNANCE/EXTANTICORRUPTION/0,,menuPK:384461~pagePK:149018~piPK:149093~theSitePK:384455,00.html 'World Bank Topic: Anticorruption']&lt;/ref&gt;

Several countries, especially economically deprived nations, have endured the brunt of [[systemic corruption]] as their public wealth illegally flowed into bank accounts and properties in developed countries and [[offshore financial centre]]s. Successful conviction of criminals and/or confiscation of their assets creates a strong deterrent for potential corrupt officials that there is no safe haven for hiding illicit wealth.

== Current feasibility ==

Successes in recent years in recovering billions of dollars of stolen assets has demonstrated that asset recovery is feasible. For example, by 2005 [[Nigeria]] had recovered $1.2 billion stolen by former President [[Sani Abacha]] by requesting assistance from multiple jurisdictions including Switzerland, Jersey, and Liechtenstein. To recover Nigerian assets, the Swiss government designated the Abacha family a "criminal organization", allowing it to bypass the need for a conviction.&lt;ref name=radha&gt;[http://www.freedomfromfearmagazine.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=98:criminal-assets&amp;catid=37:issue-1&amp;Itemid=159 Radha Ivory, ''Criminal Assets: A Little Lateral Thinking'' in Freedom from Fear Magazine, October 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, asset recovery was recognized as "a fundamental principle" of the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption|UNCAC]]. The signing and ratification of the [[UNCAC]] by over 160 countries is seen as a major step in furthering cooperation between countries to join forces to fight corruption and assist each other in recovering looted assets. Legal precedents, increasing international cooperation, as well as enhanced capacities make asset recovery more possible now than ever.

[[Image:Icar1.jpg|thumb|Each of the necessary steps—tracing, freezing, confiscation and repatriation—presents its own unique challenges.]]

== The asset recovery process ==

Managing the stages of an asset recovery investigation can be extremely time consuming, complex and requires a great deal of resources, expertise, and political will. First, a victim country must succeed in tracing the stolen assets. Second, the victim country must request cooperation from authorities in the jurisdictions where the assets reside to seize the assets; these requests usually come in the form of a [[Mutual Legal Assistance]] request or a [[letter rogatory]], though some common law countries allow the filing of a [[Mareva injunction]] in civil courts to achieve the same end. Third, legal processes must usually be initiated in the requested country in order to confiscate the assets. Following this, requested authorities must repatriate the assets back to the requesting country.

Each of the necessary steps—tracing, freezing, confiscation and repatriation—presents its own unique challenges.&lt;ref name=fourphases&gt;[http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/322c8609-8bd0-11dd-b0b1-bd28a6282634.134 'Recovering Stolen Assets' Edited by Mark Pieth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175431/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/322c8609-8bd0-11dd-b0b1-bd28a6282634.134 |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracing ===

Determining the existence of assets through an exhaustive financial investigation is the first requirement in any asset recovery case. Assets must be followed not only to their final hiding place, but causality must be established between the asset and the criminal activity. This poses a particular challenge when dealing with developing countries that have a cash-based society where monies often do not flow through the recorded financial system, other techniques must be used.

When assets do go through the financial system, tracing from one account to the next will usually leave an audit trail that can be exploited by financial investigators. As stolen assets are often layered through several different accounts and corporate vehicles, investigators will often benefit from outside information such as seized financial documents and suspicious transaction reports filed with banking regulators and other law enforcement agencies. Given the speed that monies can be transferred in the global financial system, identifying and tracing the bank accounts of the perpetrators is not an easy task, even for a seasoned investigator. A high degree of expertise, resources and cooperation between multiple intelligence and law enforcement agencies is essential for successful tracing.

Though not often, occasionally investigators may come across documentation that leads directly to the stolen assets. For example, investigations seeking to trace Ferdinand Marcos' looted billions were greatly accelerated by finding Marcos' bank records in the former presidential palace.&lt;ref name=malacanang&gt;[http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/5c8d49bf-a340-11dc-bf1b-335d0754ba85.46 Mutual Legal Assistance, Extradition and Recovery of Proceeds of Corruption in Asia and the Pacific] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175434/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/5c8d49bf-a340-11dc-bf1b-335d0754ba85.46 |date=2015-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[suspicious activity report]]s filed with national financial intelligence units can often uncover connections that can expose cases of grand corruption.

To obtain non-public information in foreign jurisdictions requires the submission of either a "Mutual Legal Assistance" (MLA) request, obtain a disclosure action through a tort claim, or submit a traditional [[letter rogatory]] through diplomatic channels. These requests are more likely to be successful when all countries involved have treaties in place, either bilateral or multilateral, to allow for legal cooperation. Notably, the UNCAC purports to provide a legal basis for international cooperation for asset recovery.

=== Freezing ===

Once financial investigations have identified assets as being possible proceeds of crime/corruption, freezing those assets becomes critical. However, premature freezing prevents investigators from following the money trail in real time. If alerted, the beneficiaries of targeted assets will most likely try to transfer the assets to make them unreachable. If delayed, there is a risk that the assets may be transferred beyond the investigator's reach. Confidentiality is key at this point. To prevent suspects from moving assets yet to be discovered, courts can place a [[gag order]] to prevent banks or officials from informing their clients until a transfer request is made. Recently some banks have also begun proactively cooperating with their national financial intelligence units by requesting consent on suspicious transfers.

In March 2006, a Guernsey branch of Banque Nationale de Paris Paribas refused to transfer funds beneficially controlled by Tommy Suharto and instead froze the funds based on guidance from Guernsey's Financial Services Commission.

=== Confiscation/forfeiture ===

Whether by criminal or civil actions, a judgment is essential to transfer legal ownership of assets already frozen back to the requesting country. See Legal Avenues to Obtaining Judgment below.

=== Repatriation/monitoring ===
There is no standard procedure for the restitution of illicitly acquired assets, as no two cases are exactly alike. Certain cases involving asset recovery have seen difficulties emerge during the repatriation stage.
While stolen money is unquestionably the sovereign property of the requesting government, enforcing asset recovery requests is often complex and costly. Often there are complex issues around the claims of legitimate third parties, as corrupt proceeds can be mixed with legitimate income.

Additionally, requested countries and the international community as a whole do not want to see repatriated assets embezzled all over again. Although determining the disposal of assets is handled on a case-by-case basis, the World Bank has acted as a neutral third party to ensure that assets are invested into development efforts such as health and education.

== Legal mechanisms to obtaining judgment ==

Determining the tactic by which an asset recovery practitioner can obtain court judgments to freeze, seize, and repatriate assets is also of critical importance. Generally, there are four approaches which can be taken to recover stolen assets.

=== Criminal confiscation ([[in personam]]) ===

Courts have the authority to confiscate assets that have been identified as the proceeds or instrumentalities of crime. In the context of international asset recovery, using criminal convictions to recover stolen assets is usually only possible when a legal basis exists between states, such as a bi-lateral or multilateral agreement. If no other arrangement is in place, [[UNCAC]] signatories may use the Convention itself as a legal basis for enforcing confiscation orders obtained in a foreign criminal court. Specifically, Article 54 Section 1A of the UNCAC provides that:

"''Each State Party (will)... take such measures as may be necessary to permit its competent authorities to give effect to an order of confiscation issued by a court of another state party.''"&lt;ref name="uncaclegalbasis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org|title=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|first=|last=agt|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, UNCAC Section 54 2A also provides for the provisional freezing or seizing of property where there are sufficient grounds for taking such actions in advance of a formal request being received. Generally, [[dual criminality]] must also exist between the jurisdictions, whereby the predicate offense must be recognized as a crime by both the requested and requesting state.

Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) is vital to this process, although there remain countries that are reluctant to enforce a court order from another jurisdiction without some form of pre-existing treaty. However, MLA requests can generate vital information in the early stages of an investigation in tracing, identifying, and temporarily freezing the accounts linked to corruption.

To be truly effective, international asset recoveries through MLA require strong inter-state cooperation as well as two critical elements—a criminal conviction either in the requesting state or the recipient state, and an enforceable confiscation order.

However, satisfying conditions for international asset recovery using criminal convictions remains problematic. Criminal proceedings usually require that the accused is present before the court, where many wrongdoers may be dead or have fled the country to avoid arrest or prosecution. MLA requests must be detailed and precisely written in the language of the requested state. Additionally, influential and powerful defendants can use their influence to suppress investigations, manipulate witnesses or judges, or hire law firms to create endless adjournments and appeals.

=== Civil proceedings (in personam) ===

States have another option to recover stolen assets—civil proceedings. In relation to foreign assets, a State will bring a private action in the civil courts of the foreign jurisdiction where corruptly acquired assets are located. This is the same process that would be used by private citizens or corporate entities with a claim against another, in the context of fraud for example, by a liquidator seeking to recover assets wrongfully diverted from an insolvent company.

This mechanism has been particularly successful in international cases involving public officials where a criminal conviction of corruption is difficult or impossible to obtain. Among the benefits of civil proceedings include a lower burden of proof ("clear and convincing/balance of probabilities" instead of "beyond a reasonable doubt") and the absence of a defendant not preventing progress in the proceedings. Instead, the court is satisfied so long as the defendant has been properly served notice of the proceedings. In the United Kingdom, the High Court held that serving notice to a lawyer acting on behalf of a defendant has also been used when the individual is in hiding.&lt;ref name="dariyefootnote"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130414065941/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/4710f64d-c5fb-11dd-b3f1-fd61180437d9.3 Edmond Angell Palmer Dodge's Case Study of Civil Proceedings against former Nigerian governor Joshua Dariye in the United Kingdom]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, civil courts retain some of the benefits of a criminal action, for example the ability to freeze assets to prevent dispersal, pierce bank secrecy, issue gag orders to third parties to maintain the confidentiality of the investigation, and even order search/seizure actions. Many practitioners have found that effective programs to recover corruptly acquired assets often use a coordinated package of criminal and civil measures to secure and recover assets. Furthermore, where criminal mechanisms can go some way to freeze but not recover assets, civil proceedings may effectively intervene.

=== Civil procedures against property ([[in rem]]) ===

A third tactic is the use of [[in rem]] actions, also known as Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture (NCBF) to recover assets directly. This method takes place in a civil court. An advantage of [[in rem]] actions is that it does not require either a civil or criminal conviction against an individual in order to confiscate his/her assets. Instead, guilt is assigned to the property and prosecutors must only prove that the property in question was involved in an illegal activity. Hence, a possible case name for [[in rem]] action could be 'United States of America vs. US $100,000 in a Toyota Pickup.' The owner or beneficiary of targeted property must then prove that either that the property was not involved or that he/she provide an innocent owner defense.

[[In rem]] asset recovery has been controversial and the fairness of the procedures has been questioned. Prior to 2000 in the United States, for example, the burden of proof was on the property owner to prove that his property was not derived from, or used to commit, a criminal offense, and there was no remedy for "innocent owners" who were without fault concerning the illegal use of their property. Remedial legislation enacted in 2000, however, addressed these concerns and Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture has become a standard part of law enforcement in the U.S., yielding US$1.5b annually in asset recoveries. While encouraged in UNCAC, adapting domestic law to create a legal basis for in rem recoveries is not required of state parties. Examples of in rem legislation can be found in jurisdictions such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Australia, Colombia and [[Proceeds of Crime Act 1996|Ireland]].

=== ''Accion civil resarcitoria'' (civil action) ===

In civil law jurisdictions, there is a fourth mechanism which is a hybrid between conviction-based and in rem actions. An 'accion civil resarcitoria' is meant to redress victims of criminal offenses and to expedite the process it takes place within the criminal court. Such actions depend on the criminal proceedings in that it cannot be initiated unless there is a concurrent criminal investigation underway. Once the criminal proceedings make it to trial, the accion civil resarcitoria separates in that forfeiture of property is not dependent on a criminal conviction of an individual. Unlike a criminal confiscation or in rem action, a successful 'accion civil resarcitoria' recognizes damages and awards a monetary compensation.

For example, in [[Switzerland]], where foreign States seeking the return of corruptly acquired assets are often permitted to be a civil party to Swiss criminal investigations or proceedings concerning those assets. Such investigations or proceedings may be commenced by an investigating magistrate on receipt of a request for [[mutual legal assistance]]. The foreign State will have the ability to access documents on the Court file, to participate in the examination of witnesses, to make submissions to the investigating magistrate, and to seek the repatriation of the assets. This procedure produces an efficient and often effective combination of civil and criminal proceedings.

== International frameworks for asset recovery ==

'''[[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] (2005)'''

Responding to increasing recognition of the problems caused by public corruption and its devastating effects on the poorest of nations, the international community took a bold step in 2003 by creating and ratifying the [[United Nations Convention Against Corruption]] (UNCAC).&lt;ref name="uncactext"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html|title=Convention against Corruption|first=|last=natasha.kamberska|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UNCAC]] came into force on December 14, 2005 and so far has been ratified by over 130 parties. While the [[UNCAC]] is not the first international effort to combat corruption, it is innovative in two respects: it is the first treaty to reference the recovery of stolen assets as a priority in the fight against corruption. Second, the treaty also provides a nearly universal multi-lateral platform for mutual legal assistance in corruption related offenses.

'''[[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention|OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions]] (1999)'''
- A convention signed by 37 countries, this OECD convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials in the context of international business transactions be criminalized. The framework of the Convention is housed in the OECD Secretariat, but country-level compliance is ensured through a rigorous peer-evaluation mechanism which monitors both the legislative framework and implementation in signatory countries under the auspices of the OECD Working Group on Bribery.

More specifically, the OECD Convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable, by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties comparable to those applicable to their own public officials. It commits Parties to interpret territorial jurisdiction in as broad a manner as possible and to establish nationality jurisdiction if this is in accord with their legal system. Parties are obliged to establish corporate liability (the liability of "legal persons") for foreign bribery, and where a Party's legal system does not provide criminal liability for companies, the Party must apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive non-criminal sanctions to them. Furthermore, countries must facilitate mutual legal assistance and cannot invoke "bank secrecy" to deny mutual legal assistance.&lt;ref name="oecdconvention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/18/0,3343,en_2649_34859_35430226_1_1_1_1,00.html#why_convention_important|title=Fighting Bribery and Corruption: Frequently asked questions - OECD|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the OECD Convention is important in the sense that it creates the obligation for state parties to criminalize the bribery of foreign public officials, it does not directly consider the recovery of proceeds of corruption.

'''[[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime|United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] (2003)'''
The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized came into force on September 29, 2003 and has been ratified by over 145 countries. The purpose of this Convention is to promote cooperation to prevent and combat transnational organized crime more effectively. It is the main international instrument in the fight against transnational organized crime.&lt;ref name="UNTOCtext"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CTOC/index.html|title=Convention on Transnational Organized Crime|first=|last=ivan.restrepo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially relevant to asset recovery is Article 6 of the Convention, which requires state parties to criminalize the laundering the proceeds of crime, and Article 12, which requires parties to create a legal basis for the confiscation of proceeds of crime.

'''[[Inter-American Convention Against Corruption]] (1997)'''

The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (IACAC) was adopted by the member countries of the Organization of American States on 29 March 1996; it came into force on 6 March 1997. The IACAC is distinctive in that it was the first international convention to address the problem of corruption.

Currently, the IACAC is ratified by 33 countries.&lt;ref name="IACACsig"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/Sigs/b-58.html|title=:: Multilateral Treaties &gt; Department of International Law  &gt; OAS ::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iacac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/English/treaties/b-58.html|title=:: Multilateral Treaties &gt; Department of International Law  &gt; OAS ::|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spirit of complementing UNCAC, 35 African Heads of State and Government met in Maputo, Mozambique in July 2003. According to Honorable. Dauda Kamara, Member of the Pan-African Parliament, a specific regional convention was "considered necessary because Africa, given its currently low-level economic development, needed to adopt specific and well defined measures that will protect its vast resources from any further exploitation by more powerful and developed nations of the world through corrupt practices". The Convention was entered into force on August 5, 2006 after the required minimum of 15 signatories was met. To date, 43 countries have signed the Convention and 29 states have ratified it.&lt;ref name="apaucc"&gt;[http://www.apnacafrica.org/docs/Sierraleoneworkshop_PRESENTATION%209%20HON.%20DAUDA%20KAMARA.doc The United Nations Convention against Corruption and the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption and Other Related Offences- An Overview and Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904051402/http://www.apnacafrica.org/docs/Sierraleoneworkshop_PRESENTATION%209%20HON.%20DAUDA%20KAMARA.doc |date=2011-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AUCACupdate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Documents/Treaties/List/African%20Convention%20on%20Combating%20Corruption.pdf |title=The African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption: List of Countries which have Signed, Ratified/Acceded |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221085010/http://www.africa-union.org/root/AU/Documents/Treaties/List/African%20Convention%20on%20Combating%20Corruption.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International asset recovery initiatives ==

There are several organizations that have prioritized asset recovery and created initiatives to enable further international cooperation while bringing the issue to the forefront of political and public discussion. These initiatives also include providing technical assistance, research and capacity development to developing countries.

These organizations include but are not limited to:

*[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC)
*[[Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative]] of the [[World Bank]] (StAR)
*[[International Centre for Asset Recovery]] (ICAR)
*[[The International Association for Asset Recovery]] (IAAR)
*[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD)
*[[Transparency International]] (TI)
*[[Financial Action Task Force]] (FATF)
*[[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE)
*[[U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u4.no/|title=U4 Anti-Corruption Resource Centre » U4|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (U4)

Additionally, several regional networks exist to facilitate judicial cooperation between national authorities by enabling direct personal contact and sharing information. These networks include, but are not limited to:
*[[Asset Recovery Interagency Network Asia Pacific]] (ARIN-AP)
*[[Camden Assets Recovery Interagency Network]] (CARIN)
*Commonwealth Network of Contact Persons
*Corruption Hunters Network
*European Judicial Network
*Hemispheric Information Exchange Network for Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters and Extradition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/mla/en/index.html|title=Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Organization of American States]]
*Ibero-American Legal Assistance Network

== Capacity development and training ==

Asset recovery can be a highly complex field of work, requiring expertise, funds, coordinated action and persistence. [COSP Note on AR] Training and technical assistance are sometimes needed to pursue asset recovery cases, particularly in those countries lacking institutional framework and experience.

Several international and inter-governmental organizations with assistance from development agencies and donor countries have begun addressing this challenge. International organizations such as the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC), the World Bank's StAR Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldbank.org/star|title=Home - Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR)|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Swiss-based non-governmental organization International Centre for Asset Recovery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baselgovernance.org/icar/|title=Asset Recovery/ICAR - Basel Governance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been offering training and capacity development.&lt;ref name="icar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baselgovernance.org/icar|title=Asset Recovery/ICAR - Basel Governance|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several organizations have taken steps to address the lack of easily accessible, comprehensive and practical information on international asset recovery. This lack of information has been identified as a key problem by a number of countries at the first meeting of the UNCAC Open-Ended Working Group on Asset Recovery held in Vienna in August 2007. The ICAR hosts an online Asset Recovery Knowledge Center&lt;ref name="ARKC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assetrecovery.org|title=Asset Recovery Forum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that includes technical publications, news articles, case studies, and individual country laws. Other organizations such as the StAR Initiative have created in-depth handbooks and manuals to assist practitioners. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) offers a free MLA Request Writer Tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/mla|title=Mutual Legal Assistance Request Writer Tool|first=|last=charlotte.gunnarsson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U4 Help Desk&lt;ref name="u4helpdesk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u4.no/helpdesk|title=Helpdesk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives practitioners the ability to ask experts any question related to asset recovery/anti-corruption and receive a tailor made response within 10 working days (or assistance within 48 hours in case of urgency).&lt;ref name="u4helpdesk"/&gt;

== Challenges ==

Despite increases in national capacities and enhanced international cooperation, many technical, legal, political, and material challenges still remain. Furthermore, there are several thorny issues to be resolved concerning the repatriation and monitoring of stolen assets to victim countries.

=== Lack of political will to enforce recoveries ===

Lack of political will has been identified repeatedly as one of the stumbling blocks to effective international asset recovery.

While over 130 countries have ratified UNCAC, there still needs to be greater international cooperation and awareness. Twenty countries have signed but not ratified the UNCAC. In other cases, mutual legal assistance requests have not been honored in spite of treaty obligations. There are many examples of cases where international asset recovery would have been possible, if there had been political will. These include: monies in Switzerland frozen that belonged to the former Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko and against former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.&lt;ref name="mobutumonies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/lawyer-warns-against-returning-mobutu-assets/7365572|title=Lawyer warns against returning Mobutu assets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moikrollreport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/wiki/The_looting_of_Kenya_under_President_Moi|title=The looting of Kenya under President Moi - WikiLeaks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repatriation of assets ===

The exact terms of repatriation are still unclear. Without specific mutual legal assistance agreements, they are done on a case by case basis. For instance, Switzerland confiscated US 600 million of former Nigerian President Abacha's loot, but worked out an agreement to use the money for development purposes, monitored by the World Bank. Other potential agreements are not so generous. When Indonesia originally approached Hong Kong to repatriate Indonesian banker Hendra Rahardja's assets, the Hong Kong authorities offered to assist for a 20% commission, and then splitting the remaining money evenly.&lt;ref name="hari"&gt;[http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/b1917646-e21a-11dd-8d28-f13739c882dc.52 RI poised to recover $800m in stolen assets ''The Jakarta Post'' May 9, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130414074129/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/node/b1917646-e21a-11dd-8d28-f13739c882dc.52 |date=April 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other impediments to asset recovery ===

*Lack of funding
*Lack of sufficient information
*Slow response (reluctance?) from requested countries
*Lack of technical capacity
*Lack of Remedial Procedures

Remedial procedures are necessary in situations where a defendant has died, absconded, or the statute of limitations has expired. Should any of these conditions apply, a traditional criminal process is not possible and assets cannot be recovered. Therefore, the UNCAC promotes the creation of remedial procedures to deal with such cases, such as Non-Conviction Based Forfeiture.

For more detailed information, the International Centre for Asset Recovery's Knowledge Center&lt;ref name="ARKC" /&gt; also contains a large collection of legal instruments, glossary, case studies, and publications relating to asset recovery.&lt;ref name="ARKC"/&gt; Notably, the Knowledge Center has an extensively detailed library of asset recovery related news articles, along with a Newsfeed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/rss/latest-news |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021234638/http://www.assetrecovery.org/kc/rss/latest-news |archivedate=2008-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is updated daily.

The Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative has also put together a Stolen Asset Recovery bibliography&lt;ref&gt;http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSARI/Resources/StAR_Bibilography_Final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which contains a list of books, journal articles and reports and other working papers produced by both governmental and nongovernmental organizations which touch upon issues associated with the recovery of stolen assets in cases of political corruption.&lt;ref name="bibliography"&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSARI/Resources/StAR_Bibilography_Final.pdf Stolen Asset Recovery Bibliography, prepared by the World Bank StAR Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; The materials listed in the bibliography focus on many aspects of the asset recovery process – from investigation and prosecution in corruption cases, to identification of stolen assets and also mutual legal assistance in situations where assets are located in a foreign jurisdiction from which a victim country seeks their return. The StAR bibliography also draws upon literature on related topics including money laundering prevention and civil asset forfeiture.

'''John Henning''' (2 May 1771 – 8 April 1851) was a Scottish carpenter who turned to sculpturing. His masterpieces were the one-twentieth-scale models he created of the [[Parthenon Frieze|Parthenon]] and [[Bassae Frieze|Bassae]] friezes.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Malden, John [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12945 Henning, John (1771–1851)] at ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004. (Registration needed for online edn.) Accessed 10 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  These took him twelve years to complete.&lt;ref name=BMmini&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/j/casts_of_the_parthenon_frieze.aspx John Henning’s miniature casts of the Parthenon frieze] at the British Museum, retrieved June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to gain a copyright on this work and others profited by copying his work.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt;

==Biography==
Henning was born in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]] and became a carpenter like his father. He was noted for his ability as a sculptor when he created cameos of his friends and family. After marrying Catherine Sunter when aged 28 and encouraged by his early cameos he went into business in Glasgow and then Edinburgh attracting clients that included [[Sir Walter Scott]]. Josiah Wedgwood was impressed by his work and agreed to champion them for Henning.&lt;ref name=blurb&gt;Wall, John ''That Most Ingenious Modeller: The Life and Work of John Henning, Sculptor'', Melrose Books, Ely, U.K. 2008. {{ISBN|978-1-906050-58-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1811, John and Catherine moved to London where Henning saw the newly arrived [[Elgin Marbles]] in [[Burlington House]] and persuaded [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] to allow him to draw and copy them.&lt;ref name=BMmini /&gt;  It was said that a commission from [[Princess Charlotte of Wales|Princess Charlotte]] of a portrait medallion inspired Henning to realise that he could use his drawings to create slate moulds that could be used to reproduce the friezes in miniature.&lt;ref name=blurb/&gt; Henning also took advantage of his sittings with the Princess to introduce her to more radical reading.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; This task was to last twelve years although Henning decided to also add the Bassae frieze to his work, and this did not arrive in England until a few years into his work. One miniature version of the Parthenon frieze was just two inches high, but over twenty four feet long.&lt;ref name=BMmini/&gt;

By 1820, Henning was ready to sell his work and it was obvious that he had not copied the remains of the friezes, but recreated them. In the case of the Parthenon frieze he had used drawings taken by [[William Pars]] in 1765, the drawings commissioned from [[Feodor Ivanowitsch]] by Lord Elgin before they were moved to England and importantly drawings made by [[Jacques Carrey]]. The last drawings were not the most detailed, but importantly they were made thirteen years before the explosion that had damaged the Parthenon in 1687.&lt;ref name=BMmini/&gt;

One copy of the miniature Parthenon frieze was sold to [[George IV of England|William IV]] for £42 in 1821&lt;ref name=BMmini/&gt; but its location is not known. He failed to gain a copyright on this work and others profited by making copies.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt; Very few original copies of these miniatures are known to exist.&lt;ref name=blurb/&gt;

In 1827, Henning and his son created sculptures in the style of the Parthenon frieze for a screen erected at Hyde Park Gate in London. The following year, John Jr. confirmed that he would recreate a copy of the Parthenon frieze for London's [[Athenaeum Club, London|Athenaeum Club]]. Although only just over half the length of the 524 feet long original this model was at the correct scale and was constructed from Bath stone in agreement with [[Decimus Burton]], the club's architect.&lt;ref name=BMmini/&gt;

Henning also made half-scale models which he hoped to reproduce for more modest buildings. Henning found that they were very popular but the business was captured across Europe by others who had unauthorised copies of his work. Equally distressing to Henning was the low quality of some of the copies. Because of this Henning became a supporter of the emerging laws on copyright but also was unhappy that his success was going unrewarded.&lt;ref name=blurb/&gt;

In 1845, Henning again invested his time based around the friezes. This time he intended to recreate the two friezes as engravings. Trial proofs were made but unfortunately his partner in the enterprise, [[Alfred Robert Freebairn]] (1794–1846), died before either of the works were completed.&lt;ref name=BMmini/&gt;
Henning died on 8 April 1851, two years after his wife. He was buried as a pauper in [[Finchley]] Churchyard.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

==Legacy==
Henning's original slate models were obtained by the [[British Museum]] in 1938. The Athenaeum Club and the screen at Hyde Park are extant. Copies of Henning's work are still being discovered.&lt;ref name=blurb/&gt; Another son [[Archibald Skirving Henning]] became an artist and he has a few paintings in public collections in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Art UK bio|wikidata=Q4786356|name=Archibald Skirving Henning}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died aged 59 in Manchester in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IWU3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA261 Obituary], The Gentleman's Magazine, 1864, retrieved 12 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; He had the same name as the Scottish painter [[Archibald Skirving]].

'''Juan Friede Alter''' (Wlava, [[Russian Empire]], 17 February 1901 - [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], 28 June 1990) was a Ukrainian-Colombian historian of Jewish descent who is recognised as one of the most important writers about Colombian history, the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish conquests]] and a proponent of [[indigenism]]; the defence of the rights and descriptions of the oppression of [[indigenous peoples of Colombia|indigenous people]].

Juan Friede went to Colombia in 1926 for business and his fascination for the country, its climate and culture made him emigrate. He became a Colombian citizen in 1930. During the 1940s, Friede made extensive studies about various indigenous peoples in the country. He was a professor at the newly founded Department of Social Sciences of the [[National University of Colombia]] and is considered one of the pioneers of the "New History" movement in Colombia, together with Jaime Jaramillo Uribe, Luis Eduardo Nieto Arteta and Luis Ospina Vásquez. His former house in San Agustín since 2006 bears the name ''Casa Museo Juan Friede''.

Juan Friede Alter was born in a village called Wlava,&lt;ref name=BancoFriede1&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/ayudadetareas/historia/historiadores_influyentes_en_colombia Historiadores internacionales influyentes en Colombia] - [[Bank of the Republic (Colombia)|Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt; indicated as Ukrainian or Polish, close to the border with Germany,&lt;ref name=JSTORFriede&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2516426?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Juan Friede (1902-1990) - Jaime Jaramillo Uribe]&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Russian Empire]] on February 17, 1901 in a Jewish family.&lt;ref name=Camacho_p487&gt;Camacho Sánchez et al., 2007. p.487&lt;/ref&gt; Friede went to school in [[Moscow]] in the turbulent years of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]. The new regime drove the family to [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] and Friede studied Economical and Social Sciences at the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business|Hochschule für Welthandel]] in Vienna, graduating in 1922. The environment of Vienna of the 1920s influenced Friede positively and he was a member of an [[green anarchism|anarcho-ecological]] society called ''Vanderfliegel''. After his studies in Vienna, he continued his research at the newly founded [[London School of Economics]]. In 1923, Friede started working for the import-export firm [[Stern family|J. Stern &amp; Co]]. The firm sent Friede to Colombia in 1926.&lt;ref name=BancoFriede1/&gt;

Friede arrived first in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and later in [[Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca|Buenaventura]]. He was so much impressed by the country, its climate, poverty and people, that he decided to emigrate. Juan Friede first settled in [[Manizales]], working for J. Stern &amp; Co in trading coffee, automobiles and other imports,&lt;ref name=JSTORFriede/&gt; a job offering him to travel through Colombia. On February 20,&lt;ref name=BancoFriede2&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/node/32608 Juan Friede: primer historiador de la problemática indígena] - [[Bank of the Republic (Colombia)|Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt; or March 3, 1930,&lt;ref name=Camacho_p487/&gt; Friede became a Colombian national. After a decline in the activities of J. Stern &amp; Co., Friede worked for Caldas Motors, a subsidiary of [[Ford Motors]] from 1935 to 1941.&lt;ref name=BancoFriede3&gt;{{es}} [http://www.banrepcultural.org/node/32526 Juan Friede (1901-1990): investigador de los indígenas y de la historia de Colombia] - [[Bank of the Republic (Colombia)|Banco de la República]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rueda_p332&gt;Rueda Enciso, 2005, p.332&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Friede moved from Manizales to Bogotá and in 1940 he opened the first [[art gallery]] in the Colombian capital.&lt;ref name=Toro_p14&gt;Toro Agudelo, 2012, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later  Colombian [[muralist]] [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] held an exposition in Friede's art gallery.&lt;ref name=TiempoNelGomez&gt;{{es}} [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-894354 Pedro Nel Gómez 1899-1984. En un país necesitado de pintores] - [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Holy Week]] of 1942, Friede made the first documentary about the important [[List of archaeological sites in Colombia|archaeological]] and [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] [[San Agustín, Huila|San Agustín]].&lt;ref name=SanAgustin&gt;{{es}} [http://www.sanagustinhuilacolombia.com/HISTORIA_DE_LA_ARQUEOLOGIA_EN_SAN_AGUSTIN.pdf Historia de la arqueología en San Agustín]&lt;/ref&gt; This formed the onset of further studies of the indigenous people of Colombia between 1943 and 1946.&lt;ref name=TiempoFriede&gt;{{es}} [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-903902 No figuraron en la série, pero los pidieron los lectores] - [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]&lt;/ref&gt; He lived in San Agustín until the end of 1945.&lt;ref name=BancoFriede1/&gt; In 1944, Friede published his book ''El indio en la lucha por la tierra'', where he described the continuous repression of the indigenous people of the department of [[Cauca Department|Cauca]].&lt;ref name=Zuluaga_p155&gt;Zuluaga, 2002, p.155&lt;/ref&gt;

Friede is considered together with Jaime Jaramillo Uribe, Luis Eduardo Nieto Arteta and Luis Ospina Vásquez, one of the founders of "New History" in Colombia, after writing a voluminous work about the conquests and indigenous history in his 1955 publication ''Documentos Inéditos para la Historia de Colombia''.&lt;ref name=Puentes_p41&gt;Puentes &amp; Suárez, 2014, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toro_p13&gt;Toro Agudelo, 2012, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 the Department of Social Sciences of the [[National University of Colombia]] was founded, where Juan Friede was one of the main professors.&lt;ref name=BioFriede&gt;{{es}} [http://www.labiografia.com/biografia-de-Juan_Friede-1076.html Biografía Juan Friede]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pineda_p70&gt;Pineda Camacho, 2004, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1962 and 1990, Friede lived in Colombia and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=TiempoFriede/&gt;

'''Karma Samdrup''' (Chinese: 嘎玛桑珠; Tibetan: ཀརྨ་བསམ་གྲུབ། born May 8, 1968) in Gonjo (Chin: Gongjue) county, [[Chamdo Prefecture]] of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], is a prominent Tibetan businessman, environmentalist and philanthropist.

In June 2010, amid increased repression of Tibetan intellectuals in an echo of the massive security crackdown that followed the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]] in the capital [[Lhasa]], a Chinese court sentenced him to 15 years in prison.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/25/world/asia/25tibet.html|periodical=New York Times|date=2010-06-24|accessdate=2010-10-26|title=Tibetan Environmentalist Receives 15-Year Sentence}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial of Samdrup was also widely viewed as an effort to punish him for his outspoken defense of his two brothers, both of whom had publicly berated a local police chief who hunted endangered species in a Tibetan nature preserve.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

Samdrup is a Tibetan art collector who became wealthy through his trade of [[Dzi bead]]s, long agate beads of dark color with a glass-like texture, which can be found in many places in Tibet.&lt;ref name="TibetInfoNet"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tibetinfonet.net/content/update/162|periodical=TibetInfoNet|date=2010-06-30|accessdate=2010-10-26|title=Landmark sentencing?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, he is widely known by his nickname 'King of Dzi,' although he has also been instrumental in popularizing certain traditional Tibetan medicines and remedies.&lt;ref name="TibetInfoNet"/&gt; [[Liu Jianqiang]], a prominent Chinese environmental journalist and writer, wrote a highly popular book titled 天珠 － 藏人传奇 (''The Tibetan Beads'', or ''Heavenly Beads'') profiling Samdrup in depth as the book's main protagonist.&lt;ref name="Tibetan Plateau Blog"&gt;{{citation|url=http://tibetanplateau.blogspot.com/2010/06/tibetan-environmentalist-karma-samdup.html|periodical=The Guardian|date=2010-06-01|accessdate=2010-10-26|title=Tibetan environmentalist Karma Samdrup to face court trial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Samdrup was named Philanthropist of the Year by state broadcaster [[China Central Television]] (CCTV) for "creating harmony between men and nature".&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/22/tibetan-environmentalist-accuses-china-torture|periodical=The Guardian|date=2010-06-22|accessdate=2010-10-26|title=Tibetan environmentalist says Chinese jailers tortured him}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Samdrup has received many environmental accolades and awards for his commitment to conservation and activism. He founded the Three Rivers Environmental Protection group and pushed for conservation of the source region for the [[Yangtze River]], [[Yellow River]] and [[Mekong]] River. This group won several awards, including the Earth Prize, which is jointly administered by Friends of the Earth Hong Kong and the Ford motor company.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; In 2006, Samdrup's environmental and cultural work received an award from Jet Li's [[One Foundation]].&lt;ref name="TIN"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.tibetinfonet.net/content/update/164|periodical=TibetInfoNet|date=2010-08-05|accessdate=2010-10-26|title=Changing tide. Karma Samdrup's sentence confirmed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal conviction==
In 1998, police charged Samdrup with buying $10,000 worth of 7th century rugs, embroidered pillows and shoes that thieves had looted from archaeological sites in the northwestern Xinjiang region. Chinese officials dropped those charges after Samdrup denied knowing that the items had been stolen and produced a license permitting him to buy and sell relics.&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1999639,00.html|periodical=TIME Magazine|date=2010-06-25|accessdate=2010-10-26|title=The Jailing of a Tibetan Art Dealer: Ominous Sign?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these charges were reinstated in January 2010, and Samdrup received a sentence of 15 years in June 2010.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt; Samdrup's appeal was rejected on July 7, 2010.&lt;ref name="TIN"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:magnusthorsteinsson.jpg|right|thumb|Magnús Þorsteinsson]] --&gt;
'''Magnús Þorsteinsson''' is a businessman and was [[chairman]] of now defunct [[Avion Group]]. He was a high-profile investor and [[entrepreneur]] with interests in [[aviation]] and [[financial services]].

==Beverage businessman in Saint Petersburg==
Magnús began his investments in [[St. Petersburg]] together with [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]] and [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]].

The Icelandic businessmen, together with Russian partners, founded a [[bottling company]] ''Baltic Bottling Plant'', which was sold to Pepsi. They moved to brewing and founded a [[brewing company]] ''Bravo International'' OOO in August 1996 which became ''Bravo International'' JSC in December 1997.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt; ''Bravo Brewery'' became a success on the premium beer [[Botchkarov]].

Danish journalists noted that the ''Committee on External Economic Relations'' in the Mayor's office was responsible for foreigners in Saint Petersburg. The committee's chairman was [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name="vladimir"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsru.com/finance/21oct2008/iceland_print.html |title=Россия желает спасать Исландию из-за давних офшорных связей чиновников и бизнесменов |date=2008-10-21 |publisher=The New Times }}.

In 2005 an article in The Guardian wondered where the Icelandic money comes from and noted that in the 1990s these Icelandic businessmen "were not only ploughing money into the country but doing it in the city regarded as the [[Russian mafia]] capital. That investment was being made in the drinks sector, seen by the mafia as the industry of choice."&lt;ref name="vikinginvasion"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/jun/16/marksspencer | title=Next-generation Viking invasion - They've got the cash to buy big UK groups like M&amp;S.

Ilya Weismann, deputy director of a competing beverage company ''Baltic'', was assassinated on 10 January 2000. Then ''Baltic'' director general Aslanbek Chochiev was assassinated. One competing Saint Petersburg brewery burned to the ground.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vikinginvasion"/&gt;

Bravo Brewery became the fastest growing brewery in Russia. [[Heineken]] bought the brewery for $400m in 2002.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whoisbjorgolfsson"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.invgr.com/bjorgolfur_thor_bjorgolfsson.htm | title=Who is Thor Bjorgolfsson, Iceland's lone billionaire? | publisher=Invest in Greece | date=2006-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consul of Russia==
In 2000, Saint Petersburg opened an honorary consulate in Iceland. [[Thor Bjorgolfsson]] was appointed [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] and Magnus Thorsteinsson was appointed Honorary Vice-Consul.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt; The opening ceremony was held on 10 March 2000.&lt;ref name="vladimir"/&gt;

==New businesses==
Magnús acquired 51% of stocks in [[Air Atlanta Icelandic]] in 2002 and a majority share in [[Landsbanki]] with other controversial business partners, [[Björgólfur Thor Björgólfsson]] and [[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]]. Magnús lost most of his fortune in the [[2008 financial crisis]] due to the high leverage in his investments.

In 1927, two companies were formed to acquire the interests of Van den Bergh in England (Margarine Union Limited) and those of Van den Bergh and Jurgens in Netherlands (N.V. Margarine Unie). The aggregate shares of the Netherland-based firm was larger but both companies were set up in an agreement that the benefits to the shareholders where the same as if it was a single company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Margarine Union Limited.|last=|first=|date=November 15, 1927|work=The Times (London, England)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoon Jurgens United (Margarine) Works was founded in 1867 by the [[Antonius Johannes Jurgens|Jurgens family]], who had been in the trade{{what|date=July 2018}} since 1801. The company introduced its manufactured margarine after acquiring patents right to [[Hippolyte Mège-Mouriès|Mège-Mouriès]]' invention in 1871. The firm along with Van den Bergh were the two largest producers of margarine in The Netherlands. In 1908, Jurgens production was 50,000 tons, the same year it formed an alliance with his rivals and both firms merged in November 1927.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Masafumi Miyamoto'''|宮本 雅史|Miyamoto Masafumi|born 1957}} is the founder of [[Square (company)|Square]]. Miyamoto graduated from [[Waseda University]] in 1983, and joined his father's [[Electric power industry|electric power conglomerate]], Den-Yu-Sha as a programmer in their software division. After transforming the games division from a group of generalist programmers into specialists working together on a common project, the group was spun out into its own company in 1986. Miyamoto served as president of the company until 1991, though he remained a major shareholder in the company.

==Biography==
===Square===
Miyamoto graduated from [[Waseda University]] in 1983, but he was not interested in joining his father's [[Electric power industry|electric power conglomerate]], Den-Yu-Sha, instead pondering a career in women's clothing manufacturing.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; He started his career developing computer games in the software division of Den-Yu-Sha at [[Yokohama]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; At the time, game development in Japan was usually conducted by only one programmer. Miyamoto recognized that it would be more efficient to have graphic designers, programmers, and professional story writers working together on common projects.&lt;ref name="paper"/&gt; To recruit for this new organizational structure, Miyamoto opened an [[Internet café]]-like salon in Yokohama and offered jobs to those who demonstrated exceptional programming skills. This strategy discovered Hisashi Suzuki, who would go on to become CEO of Square, and he in turn recruited [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], the eventual creator of ''[[Final Fantasy]]''.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 1986, Miyamoto spun Square out from Den-Yu-Sha to become an independent company with a focus on making games for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] video game system in Japan.&lt;ref name="founder"/&gt; He stepped down as president of Square in 1991.&lt;ref name=ign/&gt;

===Square Enix Merger===
During the discussion of the merger of Square and [[Enix]] in 2002, his approval of the merger was essential because of his major stake in Square.&lt;ref name=fan2/&gt; Initially, the ratio of Square shares was to be 1 to .81 shares of Enix, which  Miyamoto objected to.&lt;ref name=fan/&gt; When the merger went through, 1 share of Square resulted in 0.85 shares of Enix.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Miyamoto made 5 million shares, or 9% of the company, available for purchase in the summer of 2002, but still retained 31.04% ownership.&lt;ref name=ign/&gt; He is currently the fifth largest shareholder of [[Square Enix]].&lt;ref name=share/&gt;

'''Micael Dahlén''' (born 18 June 1973) is a Swedish author, public speaker and Professor of marketing and consumer behavior at the [[Stockholm School of Economics]], Sweden. His award-winning research within marketing, creativity and consumer behavior has been published in four books and numerous journal articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Author Profile: Micael Dahlén|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470770848,descCd-authorInfo.html|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahlén's books have reached a global audience, rights being sold to countries such as the U.S, U.K, Germany, South Korea, Russia and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography: Micael Dahlén|url=http://www.micaeldahlen.com/books/|publisher=Micael Dahléns official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Dahlén stated in an interview that he was writing a novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We'll no longer separate our private lives from our working lives|url=http://www.fujitsunews.se/en/926/%E2%80%9Cwe%E2%80%99ll-no-longer-separate-our-private-lives-from-our-working-lives%E2%80%9D/|publisher=Fujitsu News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418092052/http://www.fujitsunews.se/en/926/%E2%80%9Cwe%E2%80%99ll-no-longer-separate-our-private-lives-from-our-working-lives%E2%80%9D/|archivedate=18 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==

Dahlén earned his PhD in 2001 from the Economic Research Institute at [[Stockholm School of Economics]]. Dahléns PhD thesis, "Marketing on the Web: empirical studies of advertising and promotion effectiveness", challenged the traditional logic of Web advertising and suggested that Internet marketing could be much more effective if designed and evaluated differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marketing on the Web: empirical studies of advertising and promotion effectiveness|url=http://hhs.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:221651|publisher=Stockholm School of Economics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a researcher, Dahlén rose rapidly to take up a leading position in the field of consumer behavior, creativity and marketing. Only 34 years old he was made Professor. In the same year, 2008, Journal of Advertising ranked Dahlén as number 10 in the world among researchers within the field of advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Handelshögskolan i Stockholm ledande inom reklamforskning i Europa|url=http://www.ifl.se/sv/Om-IFL/Press/2008/HANDELSHOGSKOLAN-I-STOCKHOLM-LEDANDE-INOM-REKLAMFORSKNING-I-EUROPA/|publisher=IFL, Stockholm School of Economics|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402113537/http://www.ifl.se/sv/Om-IFL/Press/2008/HANDELSHOGSKOLAN-I-STOCKHOLM-LEDANDE-INOM-REKLAMFORSKNING-I-EUROPA/|archivedate=2 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Dahlén has also established the full-semester specialization course called Marketing Communication XL at Stockholm School of Economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is XL?|url=http://mcxl.se/what-is-xl/|publisher=MCXL|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503001623/http://mcxl.se/what-is-xl/|archivedate=3 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==

Dahlén has written six books on diverse topics such as marketing, happiness, serial-killers and [[social media]] which have been translated into a number of languages.

'''Creativity Unlimited: Thinking Inside the Box for Business Innovations'''

Dahlén's first public success was the book "Creativity Unlimited: Thinking Inside the Box for Business Innovations", in which he book suggested that we do not need to 'think outside the box' in our quest for creativity, rather we should rethink the way we look 'inside the box'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book description|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470770848,descCd-description.html|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was praised for "demystifying the process of creativity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Book review: Creative thinking begins inside the box|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/sme/book-review-creative-thinking-begins-inside-the-box-991034.html|publisher=The Independent | location=London|first=Roger|last=Trapp|date=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nextopia'''

In the book "Nextopia" Dahlén states that we live in an expectation society, a society where we are constantly striving towards our next job, the next big thing, the next date. We are striving towards a Nextopia that holds the promise that our greatest pleasures and adventures lie ahead. With a set of ideas and theories about sex, drugs and rock 'n roll as natural expressions of human nature, Dahlén explains how this change in society and human mind impacts companies' and their ways of working, as well as how it impacts us as individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Nextopia?|url=http://nextopia.info/what-is-nextopia/|publisher=Nextopia.info|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711102439/http://nextopia.info/what-is-nextopia/|archivedate=11 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Monster'''

In his latest book "Monster" Dahlén chose a topic differing from his previous work: Serial-killers and the human fascination for evil. Dahlén travelled across the globe to interview famous murderers, such as [[Charles Manson]] and the Japanese cannibal [[Issei Sagawa]]. The goal was to answer the question of how killing another person can make someone an international superstar, admired by millions?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Micael Dahlén Talks about his new book|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-rGf4l5ygo|publisher=Spectrum Books, video interview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahlén also conducted several studies of his own on, i.e. how people perceive murderers and how many murders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Homicidol Effect: Investigating Murder as a Fitness Signal.|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.2011.573595|publisher=Micael Dahlén &amp; Magnus Söderlund, The Journal of Social Psychology, Volume 152, Issue 2, 2012.}}&lt;/ref&gt; fictional or real, that a person is exposed to on an average day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The "killer" ad: an assessment of advertising violence|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=1891431&amp;show=abstract|publisher=Micael Dahlén &amp; Magnus Söderlund, European Journal of Marketing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahlén also coined the term "Mansonomics" to describe how people, not only the murderers themselves, profit from these horrible acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinerad av monster|url=http://www.etc.se/noje/fascinerad-av-monster|publisher=ETC Magazine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418032153/http://www.etc.se/noje/fascinerad-av-monster|archivedate=18 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''NOS, [[holding company|SGPS]] S.A.''' is a Portuguese [[Mass media|media]] [[holding company|holding]] company whose main assets include a [[satellite television|satellite]], [[cable television|cable operator]],  and [[ISP]], a [[mobile phone operator]], a movie distributor ([[NOS Audiovisuais]]) and a virtual carrier of mobile phone services. Its services include [[cable television]], [[cable internet]] and [[VOIP]]. NOS (formerly '''PT Multimédia''', '''ZON Multimédia''' and '''ZON Optimus''') is the spun-off media arm of [[Portugal Telecom]]. NOS produces several [[pay TV|premium channels]] for the TV platform, which include [[Sport TV|SportTV]] (joint-venture with [[Controlinveste]]) and [[TVCine]]. NOS Audiovisuais (formerly ZON Lusomundo) is also the [[home-video]] distributor of [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[DreamWorks]] and [[Paramount Pictures]] releases in the Portuguese market, alongside of launching several independent and European titles.

== History ==
NOS was founded as TVCabo in 1994, and was the third cable operator to be founded in Portugal (the first was the regional Cabo TV Madeirense, which was founded in 1992, followed by Bragatel early on in 1994). The first customer was connecter in November 1994. Initially the channel offer consisted of thirty channels and the number of Portuguese-speaking channels was initially limited to the terrestrial channels, with the number of Portuguese-speaking channels increasing as the years went on.

The company might be considered a Portuguese [[Dot-com company|dot-com]]. In the PT Multimédia days, it brought [[Portugal Telecom]] [[SAPO (company)|SAPO]] (a successful web portal and search engine, sold to its parent company in 2005), [[Lusomundo]] (a successful movie distributor, [[movie theater]] operator included in the spun off company and, formerly, the owner of the [[Diário de Notícias]] newspaper and the [[TSF (radio)|TSF]] radio, which were sold to Controlinveste the same year as SAPO was sold) and several TV channels such as [[Sport TV|SportTV]], CNL (now [[SIC Notícias]]) and [[TVCine]]. ([[MOV (TV channel)|MOV]] was only created after the spin-off).

On 17 January 2008, ZON announced it would acquire [[TVTEL]], its main competitor in both cable and satellite broadcasting in Porto region. Thus, ZON is strengthening its position due to the appearance of a new significant rival, [[Meo (Portugal)|MEO]] from [[Portugal Telecom]], using [[IPTV]] and satellite broadcasting systems, and there remains one other more cable television and internet operator in Portugal, [[Cabovisão]].

On 29 September 2008, ZON Multimédia announced the new mobile product ZON Mobile ([[MVNO]]), the first real quad play operator in Portugal.

In November 2008, [[ZON]] announced that it would enter the contest for the fifth channel that would be created at the same time as [[Digital Terrestrial Television]] is introduced in Portugal.

On 17 March 2010, ZON renamed its cable and satellite television service as ZON TV, dropping the 16-year-old '''TV Cabo''' brand.

In 2013, the merger with [[Optimus Telecomunicações|Optimus]] (which also includes [[Optimus Clix]], Optimus Kanguru, Optimus Tag, Smart and WTF) was approved and the company was renamed to '''ZON Optimus'''. In May 2014, the two brands ZON and Optimus were merged into one single brand, called NOS (meaning "us").

A subdistrict of the French Quarter/CBD area, its boundaries, as defined by the City Planning Commission, are Iberville, [[Decatur Street (New Orleans)|Decatur]] and [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]]s to the north; the [[Mississippi River]] to the east; the [[New Orleans Morial Convention Center]], Julia and [[Magazine Street]]s, and the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]] to the south; and [[Claiborne Avenue|South Claiborne Avenue]], Cleveland Street, and South and North Derbigny Streets to the west. It is the equivalent of what many [[city|cities]] call their [[downtown]], although in New Orleans [[Downtown New Orleans|"downtown" or "down town"]] was historically used to mean all portions of the city downriver from Canal Street (in the direction of flow of the Mississippi River). In recent decades, however, use of the catch-all "downtown" adjective to describe neighborhoods downriver from Canal Street has largely ceased, having been replaced in usage by individual neighborhood names (such as [[Bywater, New Orleans|Bywater]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Originally developed as the largely-residential [[Faubourg#New Orleans|Faubourg]] Ste. Marie (''English:'' St. Mary Suburb) in the late 18th century, the modern Central Business District is today a dynamic, mixed-use neighborhood, the home of professional offices in skyscrapers, specialty and neighborhood retail stores, numerous restaurants and clubs, and thousands of residents inhabiting restored, historic commercial and industrial buildings.

==Geography==
The Central Business District is located at {{Coord|29|56|59|N|90|04|14|W|type:city}} &lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an elevation of {{convert|3|ft|1}}.&lt;ref name="GR3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=US Board on Geographic Names|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is true of most of [[New Orleans metropolitan area|metropolitan New Orleans]], the parts of the district nearer the river are higher in elevation than areas further removed from it. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the district has a total area of {{convert|1.18|sqmi|1}}.  {{convert|1.06|sqmi|1}} of which is land and {{convert|0.12|sqmi|1}} (10.17%) of which is water.

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]&lt;ref name="GR2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=American FactFinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; of 2000, there were 3,435 inhabitants of the census tracts best corresponding to the boundaries of the New Orleans Downtown Development District. The [[population density]] was 1,692 /mi² (664 /km²). Another 4,142 inhabitants of the adjacent [[French Quarter]] neighborhood were recorded in the 2000 Census. The CBD, its subdistricts (e.g., the '''Warehouse District'''), and the bordering neighborhoods of [[Tremé]], the French Quarter, and the [[Lower Garden District, New Orleans|Lower Garden District]] possessed 21,630 residents, according to the 2000 Census.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2009}}
Streets in the Central Business District (originally ''Faubourg Ste. Marie'') were initially platted in the late 18th century, representing the first expansion of [[New Orleans]] beyond its original French Quarter footprint. Significant investment began in earnest following the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803, as people from other parts of the [[United States]] flocked to the city. Consequently, the district began to be referred to as the '''American Sector'''.

While traditionally [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] was viewed as the dividing line between the [[French Quarter]] and the American Sector, legally both sides of Canal Street are today considered part of the Central Business District for zoning and regulatory purposes. Through the 19th and into the 20th century, the Central Business District continued developing almost without pause. By the mid-20th century, most professional offices in the region were located downtown, the hub of a well-developed [[New Orleans Public Service Incorporated|public transit system]].

Canal Street was the primary retail destination for New Orleanians, as well as for residents of the surrounding region. Local and regional [[department store]]s [[Maison Blanche]], [[D.H. Holmes]], Godchaux's, [[Gus Mayer]], Labiche's, Kreeger's, and [[Krauss Building|Krauss]] anchored numerous well-known specialty retailers, such as [http://www.rubensteinsneworleans.com/about/history.php Rubenstein Bros.], [[Adler's Jewelry]], Koslow's, Rapp's, and [[P. P. Werlein|Werlein's Music]]. National retailers, like [[S.H. Kress &amp; Co.|Kress]], [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]], and [[Walgreens]] were present alongside local drugstore [[K&amp;B]]. [[Sears]] operated a large store one block off Canal, on Baronne Street.

Bookstores, theaters, and movie palaces also abounded, with the neon marquees of the [[Saenger Theatre (New Orleans)|Saenger]], [[State Palace Theatre (New Orleans)|Loews State]], [[Orpheum Theater (New Orleans)|RKO Orpheum]], [[Joy Theater|Joy]], and [[Civic Theatre (New Orleans)|Civic]] theaters nightly casting multi-colored lights onto surrounding sidewalks.

In the 1950s, six-lane '''Loyola Avenue''' was constructed as an extension of Elk Place, cutting a swath through a low-income residential district and initially hosting the city's new civic center complex. The late-1960s widening of '''Poydras Street''' was undertaken to create another six-lane [[Downtown circulator|central area circulator]] for vehicular traffic, as well as to accommodate modern high-rise construction. The City of New Orleans partook in transforming the district from 1973 to 1993, in a collaboration between public and private sectors to spark active community participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks|first=Jane S.|last2=Young|first2=Alma H.|date=1993-01-01|title=Revitalising the Central Business District in the Face of Decline: The Case of New Orleans, 1973-1993|jstor=40113232|journal=The Town Planning Review|volume=64|issue=3|pages=251–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portion of the CBD closer to the Mississippi River and upriver from Poydras Street is known as the '''Warehouse District''', because it was heavily devoted to [[warehouse|warehousing]] and manufacturing before shipping became [[containerization|containerized]].  The [[1984 Louisiana World Exposition|1984 World's Fair]] drew attention to the then semi-derelict district, resulting in steady investment and redevelopment from the mid-1980s onward.  Many of the old 19th-century warehouses have been converted into [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, [[condominium]]s, and [[art gallery|art galleries]].

Notable structures in the CBD include the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] [[Gallier Hall]] (the city's former [[city hall (administration)|city hall]]); the [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]]; the [[New Orleans Arena]]; the city's present-day, [[International style (architecture)|International style]] city hall; and [[One Shell Square]], the city's tallest building and headquarters for [[Royal Dutch Shell]]'s Gulf of Mexico Exploration and Production.  Other significant attractions include the postmodern [[Piazza d'Italia, New Orleans|Piazza d'Italia]], [[Harrah's New Orleans|Harrah's Casino]], the [[2 Canal Street|World Trade Center New Orleans]], the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]], [[St. Patrick's Church (New Orleans)|St. Patrick's Church]], the [[Hibernia Bank Building (New Orleans)|Hibernia Bank Building]], and the former [[New Orleans Cotton Exchange]].

The principal public park in the CBD is [[Lafayette Square, New Orleans|Lafayette Square]], upon which face both Gallier Hall and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.  Other public spaces include Duncan Plaza, Elk Place, the Piazza d'Italia, [[Lee Circle]], Mississippi River Heritage Park, Spanish Plaza, and the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Plaza.

[[Museums]] include the [[National World War II Museum]], the [[Ogden Museum of Southern Art]], the Louisiana Children's Museum, the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center and [[Confederate Memorial Hall]].

New Orleans CBD was one of the few areas of New Orleans that escaped the [[Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|catastrophic flooding]] of 2005's Hurricane Katrina.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Government and infrastructure==
The New Orleans City Hall and surrounding structures, including the ''circa''-1960, architecturally award-winning Main Branch of the [[New Orleans Public Library]] face '''Duncan Plaza''', an exercise in 1950s-style [[urban renewal]] embodying then-mayor [[DeLesseps Story Morrison|Chep Morrison's]] desire to create a modern [[civic center]].  The '''New Orleans Civic Center''' is today much diminished, with the [[Louisiana Supreme Court]] building having been torn down in the wake of the court's 2004 departure for the [[French Quarter]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasc.org/Bicentennial/lasc_history.aspx History of the Louisiana Supreme Court], retrieved 16 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; the Louisiana State office building having suffered the same fate, and Duncan Plaza itself having been fenced off.

The [[United States Postal Service]] operates the New Orleans Main Post Office at 701 Loyola Avenue in the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/75104?p=1&amp;s=LA&amp;service_name=post_office&amp;z=New+Orleans Post Office Location - N O MAIN OFC WINDOW SVE]."

The [[New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal|Union Passenger Terminal]] is the [[Terminal train station|terminus]] for three of [[Amtrak|Amtrak's]] long-distance trains, the [[City of New Orleans (train)|City of New Orleans]], the [[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent]] and, since 2005, the [[Sunset Limited]] (with the elimination, due to [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] damage, of the eastbound portion of the Sunset Limited route), and also offers inter-city bus service via [[Greyhound Lines]].

[[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]] access is provided by [[Interstate 10|I-10]], via the Claiborne and [[Pontchartrain Expressway|Pontchartrain]] Expressways.  When I-10 curves to the east by the Louisiana Superdome and becomes the Claiborne Expressway, elevated above N. Claiborne Avenue, the Pontchartrain Expressway continues as [[U.S. Route 90 Business (New Orleans, Louisiana)|U.S. Route 90 Business]] and crosses the Mississippi River on the twin-bridge [[Crescent City Connection]].

Significant thoroughfares in the CBD include [[St. Charles Avenue]], Camp Street, [[Carondelet Street]], Gravier Street, Poydras Street, [[Tchoupitoulas Street]], Howard Avenue, and [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]].  Prior to the 1980s, the intersection of Gravier and Carondelet streets was the ''de facto'' heart of the city's financial district.  Though still a vibrant area, that part of the CBD witnessed the migration of much business slightly upriver to Poydras Street, as many modern [[List of tallest buildings in New Orleans|high-rise office towers]] were constructed there in the 1970s and 1980s.  The widening of Loyola Avenue, Poydras Street and O'Keefe Avenue aimed to simultaneously create an effective [[downtown circulator]] high capacity road network for automobile traffic and make room for large-scale redevelopment (e.g., Duncan Plaza, [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]]).  However, many of the development sites created in the wake of these improvements were never built upon, leaving a noticeable and unfortunate quantity of surface parking lots along these widened streets.

==Economy==
[[Entergy]], the region's sole [[Fortune 500]] firm, maintains its headquarters in the CBD, as does [[Reily Foods Company]], which markets [[Luzianne]] products and Standard Coffee.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.luzianne.com/contact_us.php Contact Us]."

(HRI Properties), [[Tidewater (marine services)|Tidewater Marine]], Energy Partners Ltd., Intermarine, IMTT, International Coffee Corp., and The Receivables Exchange.

The CBD also hosts the '''New Orleans I.P.''', an "Intellectual Property", home to numerous [[creative industries]] firms, and numerous bioscience companies are established at the '''New Orleans BioInnovation Center''', located within BioDistrict New Orleans.

The regional economic alliance '''Greater New Orleans, Inc.''' (GNO Inc.), [[New Orleans metropolitan area|the New Orleans metropolitan area's]] lead economic development entity for the ten-parish New Orleans region, is also headquartered downtown, as is the '''New Orleans Business Alliance''' (NOLA BA), the public-private partnership agency leading economic development efforts for the city proper.

The [[World Trade Center New Orleans|World Trade Center of New Orleans]] (WTCNO) has been located in the CBD since its establishment in 1943. The WTCNO facilitates the addition of wealth and jobs in Louisiana through international trade, economic development, and allied activities by supporting a prosperous international business climate in Louisiana.

==[[Diplomatic mission]]s==
The [[Diplomatic missions of Mexico|Consulate of Mexico]] in New Orleans is located in the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://portal.sre.gob.mx/nuevaorleans/ Bienvenidos Consulado de México en Nueva Orleáns]."

[[Image:Stockholm Centrals staty 2006l.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Statue of Nils Ericson in front of [[Stockholm Central Station]]]]
'''''Friherre'' Nils Ericson''' (31 January 1802 &amp;ndash; 8 September 1870) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[mechanics|mechanical]] [[engineer]] (as was his younger brother [[John Ericsson]], who emigrated to England and then the USA). He became a prominent Swedish canal and railway builder.

Born Nils Ericsson, he was raised to the untitled nobility by king [[Oscar I of Sweden]] in 1854, and with this he reverted to a spelling of his surname with only one "s". In 1859 he was made a [[Freiherr#Swedish title|Friherre]] (equivalent to English [[Baron]]), the 403rd such elevation to Sweden's titled nobility.

==Background==
John and Nils were born in [[Långbanshyttan]], [[Värmland]], Sweden and received no formal education, but were taught the rudiments of mechanics from an early age by their father, Olof Ericsson.{{sfn|Church|1890|p=17}} Olof worked as the superintendent of a [[mining|mine]] in Värmland until he lost money in speculations and had to move his family to [[Forsvik]], [[Västergötland]], in 1810. There Olaf became a director of blastings during the excavation of Sweden's [[Göta Canal]] (built 1810-1832). He secured permission for his sons to draw in the office of the draughtsmen of the canal company, where they also learned to draw maps, and he persuaded Lieutenant Brandenburg of the Navy Mechanical Corps to teach them the art of shading and 'finishing off' mechanical drawings before they were in their teens.{{sfn|Church|1890|p=15}}

Their extraordinary skills were noted by [[Baltzar von Platen (1766-1829)|Baltzar von Platen]], the architect of the Göta Canal, and they were soon dubbed cadets of mechanics of the [[Swedish Navy]] and engaged as trainees at the canal enterprise. When two engineers sent to England by Count Platen to obtain information about canal construction returned in 1815 and began to instruct a number of cadets of the Swedish Corps of Mechanical Engineers, the Ericsson brothers were among them; Nils being then twelve years old and John eleven.{{sfn|Church|1890|p=18}}

==Career==
In 1823 Nils Ericson joined the Engineering corps of the [[Swedish Army]] as a second lieutenant, but in 1830 he transferred to the Navy Mechanical Corps (where he eventually advanced to the rank of colonel in 1850). In 1833 he married a daughter of Count von Schwerin in [[Östergötland]].

Between 1830 and 1850 Nils Ericson planned and directed the construction of the canals at Stallbacka, [[Säffle]], [[Karlstad]] and Albrektsund. He also led the construction of the [[Saimaa Canal]] in [[Finland]] (constructed 1845-52), the reconstruction of the [[Trollhätte Canal]] in [[Trollhättan Municipality]] and the [[floodgate]] at [[Stockholm]]. In 1845, he was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

After 1850 he was primarily occupied with the design and construction of the Swedish state-owned railway system. At the same time he led the planning of the [[Dalsland Canal]] while construction there was being led by his son Werner.

Sweden started building railways later than many other European countries, having hesitated under heavy debate for several years because of the costs and other issues. Following the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]]'s decision in 1854, Erikson was chosen to lead the project of building the main lines (stambanorna). There was also a decision that, for military reasons, the railways should avoid the coasts as much as possible.

His proposal was that the line between Gothenburg and Stockholm ([[Western Main Line]], ''Västra stambanan'') should run south of Lake [[Mälaren]] to avoid competition with shipping. He also proposed that the line between [[Malmö]] and Stockholm ([[Southern Main Line]], ''Södra stambanan'') should go north via Nässjö to meet up with Western Main Line at [[Falköping]] until the Western's eastward construction reached [[Katrineholm]], where a better junction could be built with a southern line heading directly to Nässjö.  This line was called Eastern Main Line (''Östra stambanan'') but has in modern times been defined to be part of the Southern Main Line.  Ericson's proposal also included the railway between Stockholm and [[Ånge]] ([[Northern Main Line]], ''Norra stambanan'') and [[Main Line Through Upper Norrland]] (''Stambanan genom övre Norrland'') which runs between [[Bräcke]] and [[Boden, Sweden|Boden]]. A railway between [[Oslo]] and [[Laxå]] ([[Värmland Line|Northwestern Main Line]], ''Nordvästra stambanan'') was also planned, to connect with Western Main Line.

The first parts of the Western and Southern lines were opened in 1856. Ericson resigned in 1862 when all of the Western line opened, and in 1864 the Southern line was opened in its entirety. Northwestern line was opened in 1871, Eastern line in 1874, Northern line in 1881 and the line through Upper Norrland in 1894. When Ericson resigned in 1862 his authority was divided between two agencies (the Building Bureau and the Traffic Bureau) until the formation of Kungliga Järnvägsstyrelsen (the Royal Railway Committee) in 1888.

Ericson died in Stockholm in 1870, aged 68, and lies buried in Stockholm's Northern Cemetery ([[Norra begravningsplatsen]]).

'''''Prison Tycoon''''' is a [[business simulation game|business simulation]] [[computer game]] developed by Virtual Playground and published by [[ValuSoft]] in [[2005 in video gaming|July 2005]] that puts the user in charge of a [[prison]]. Objectives are to keep the prison running, keep the staff happy, keep the prisoners in line, all while trying to make money.

Users are allowed to choose between a [[New England]] prison, a modern [[Southwestern United States|U.S. Southwestern]]-style prison, and a [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]-style prison modelled after [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]].

A sequel, ''Prison Tycoon 2: Maximum Security'', was released on September 8, 2006, followed by ''Prison Tycoon 3: Lockdown'' in 2007 and ''Prison Tycoon 4: Supermax'' in 2008, then ''Prison Tycoon: Alcatraz'' in late 2010.

Also, [[THQ Wireless]] released a version of Prison Tycoon for the [[iPhone]] in May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prison-tycoon/id313348437?mt=8|title=iPhone App|publisher=Apple|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''Prison Tycoon'' has generally received poor grades from critics. ''[[X-Play]]''{{'}}s Time Stevens gave the game only one star out of five, concluding his review by writing that "Prisons aren't supposed to be fun, so maybe it shouldn't be a surprise that a game about prisons isn't either."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://g4tv.com/xplay/reviews/1239/Prison_Tycoon.html|title=Prison Tycoon|publisher=G4tv.com|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; GameZone gives the game a score of 5/10, praising the idea and concept but complaining about clunky graphics, dysfunctional camera angles and lack of instructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r27725.htm|title=Prison Tycoon Review|publisher=GameZone|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of common complaints of the game include bad camera angles, lackluster graphics, choppy or slow framerates, annoying music and sound, and limited help for players; while most players agreed the concept was neat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/prisontycoon/player_review.html?id=235832&amp;tag=player-reviews|title=Prison Tycoon Player Reviews|publisher=Gamespot|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

The premise of the game is to create a functional prison complete with walls, guard towers, housing wings, dining, workout and medical facilities. The objective of the game is ultimately to turn your low security incarceration facility into a profitable maximum security prison. Funding is collected by the player through state funding, charitable donations and inmate labor depending on a myriad factors, such as employee satisfaction and inmate happiness and rehabilitation. You have the option to start with a completely blank slate in a free-play mode or with the basic layout of an existing prison with several problems that need to be addressed in the challenge mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisontycoon.com/pages/features.htm |title=Prison Tycoon Features |publisher=ValuSoft |accessdate=2010-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330061234/http://www.prisontycoon.com/pages/features.htm |archivedate=March 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The challenges range from rehabilitating a certain number of inmates, reducing the number of riots and fights within the prison or simply to reaching a certain level of security.  To create a prison the player places buildings or walls along a grid system  by selecting which building they would like and placing it somewhere within the boundaries of the map.  There are over 100 different buildings that can be constructed.  Within certain buildings the player can build different rooms from over 100 to choose from, such as rooms with multiple beds within one cell or solitary confinement cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prisontycoon.com/pages/features.htm|title=Prison Tycoon Features|publisher=ValuSoft|accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buildings come with their appropriate staffing, for example guard towers come with guards already positioned in the tower and medical facilities come with medical staffing.

Once a player has constructed sufficient housing and basic amenities, prisoners begin arriving on buses depending on the capacity of the prison.  Prisoners continue to arrive as long as there is sufficient capacity to hold them and depart as they complete their sentences.  As the number of inmates increases the prison upgrades to a higher security level, beginning at low security until it becomes a maximum security prison.  With higher levels of security the player has access to more advanced facilities and upgraded walls and guard towers.

Players are able to click on both inmates and staff to get a basic description of their levels of satisfaction, fatigue, productivity, as well as misconduct for prisoners.  Players are also able to assign prisoners to cells, jobs and activities by clicking on one of these things with the prisoner selected.  Also, players can drag and drop guards to areas of high misconduct or to break up riots which occur within the prison if prisoners become too dissatisfied.

===Inmates===
[[Image:Prisontycoonriot.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Rioting prisoners being subdued by the guards.]]

The game designers created 96 different looking inmates capable of over 100 different animations to allow for a varied prison population.  Inmates have various meters above their heads which the player can monitor by clicking on the prisoners.  They have levels of satisfaction, fatigue, productivity and misconduct.  If inmates do not have activities, such as working out, playing basketball or performing work they will become dissatisfied and their misconduct meter will increase.  Having high misconduct will result in decreased productivity and an increase in fights and riots breaking out within the prison.

Ultimately, it is important to monitor inmate morale and keep it high to increase profits, as high inmate morale and sufficient rooming will result in more inmates arriving.  Also, the player has the ability to suggest inmates to the parole board, for possible early dismissal.  The approval or rejection of a prisoner is based upon the number of fights he has been in, the number of gangs he is affiliated with, the number of rehabilitation projects he has completed as well as his misconduct rating.

'''"Putin. War"''' ({{lang-ru|Путин. Война}}) is a report based on materials prepared by the Russian opposition politician [[Boris Nemtsov]] about the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine]]. Published on the website ''Putin. Itogi'' on 12 May 2015, it covers the preparations for the [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] and the involvement of Russian troops in the [[war in Donbass]]. The report includes testimonials of Russian soldiers taken prisoner in Ukraine and photos of Russian military personnel who died in the hostilities.&lt;ref name=RFE-200/&gt;&lt;ref name=MT150512/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meduza150513/&gt;

==Authors==
[[Boris Nemtsov]] began working on the report at the end of January 2015. After [[Assassination of Boris Nemtsov|Nemtsov's assassination]], his close associate [[Ilya Yashin]] headed a team of opposition journalists and activists, who continued writing the report and prepared it for publication.&lt;ref name=RFE-friends/&gt;

[[File:2015-03-01 Шествие памяти Немцова L1520063 Путин — это война.jpg|300px|thumb|"Putin is war"]]

==Structure and content==
The [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] of the report is a post by Boris Nemtsov in Facebook on 31 January 2015:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/boris.nemtsov/posts/758395224230080&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The task of the opposition today is education and truth.&lt;br /&gt;And the truth is that Putin is war and crisis.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The report consists of a preface, 11 chapters and a conclusion. It has 65 large-format pages with 46 color photographs and 8 charts.

Chapters:
#Why [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]] needs this war
#Lies and propaganda
#How they took Crimea
#The Russian military in the east of Ukraine
#Volunteers or mercenaries?
#[[Cargo 200 (code name)|Cargo 200]]
#Vladimir Putin's Army Depot
#Who shot down the [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17|Boeing]]
#Who rules the Donbass
#The humanitarian disaster
#What does the war with Ukraine cost?
Chapters cover the events from the beginning of [[Euromaidan]] when the [[Kremlin]] developed plans for the "annexation of Crimea" up to the start of 2015. The report includes information from relatives of Russian servicemen who died in Ukraine. The authors write that Putin's "[[Hybrid warfare|hybrid war]]" involves [[doublethink]], falsehoods and сowardliness, concluding:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cowardly and despicable war unleashed by Putin will cost the country a lot. We will be paying for this adventure with the lives of our soldiers, economic crisis and political isolation.

We will pay with enmity from our long-time allies. No people are closer and more like kin to the Russians than the Ukrainians. These are our brothers - without any pathos -- and the war between [[Russians in Ukraine|Russians]] and Ukrainians in Donbass is impossible to characterize in any other way except as fratricide.

This war is the shame of our country. But the problem will not go away by itself. Putin must be stopped. And this can only be done by the Russian people themselves.

Let us stop this war together.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Amendment (Scotland) Act''' is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]] which amends section 7(4) of the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 in respect of rights of several fishery.

==Background==
The original Bill was introduced in the Scottish Parliament on 8 March 2000 by [[Tavish Scott]] [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]. The existing Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 required that a shellfish farmer seeking a Several Order to allow them to control an area of seabed on which to farm shellfish frequently encountered opposition from fishermen who fish in the area to be covered by the Order. If the Several Order was issued, all fishing was banned within the area covered, regardless of whether or not the fishing operations damaged the interests of the shellfish farmer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/bills/billsPassed/b11s1fm.pdf ''Financial Memorandum''], Scottish Parliament, 8 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The amendment to the 1967 Act allows Scottish Ministers making a Several Order to authorise the continuation of specified non-damaging fishing operations
within the area covered by the Order. The aim of the Bill was thus to avoid unnecessary and avoidable conflicts of interests between shellfish farmers and fishermen.

==Provision==
The purpose of the Bill was to permit Scottish Ministers to authorise the use by fishermen of non-damaging types of fishing gear such as creels in areas covered by Several
Fisheries Orders. Thus, in section 7 of the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 (c.83) (protection of fisheries), in subsection (4)(a), after sub-paragraph (ii) there was inserted:

"or

(iii) in the case of several fishery, an implement of a type specified in the order and so used as not to disturb or injure in any manner shellfish of the description in question."

== Passage through Parliament==
The Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Amendment (Scotland) Act 2000 asp 12 was passed by the [[Scottish Parliament]] on 28 September 2000. The bill was given the [[Royal Assent]] on 2 November 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3000">'''Target culture''' is a pejorative term used to refer to the perceived negative effects of rigid adherence to performance targets by businesses and organisations. The term is primarily used to refer to this kind of behaviour within the provision of public services in the [[United Kingdom]]. Target culture often stems from not being able to accurately measure a broad social good like health, education or crime prevention: instead, specific target like increasing the number of people passing an examination  or the number of arrests made by a police force is used.

== Examples ==

School league tables and other education statistics are often criticised as an example of target culture. The use of number of [[GCSE]] examinations passed at grade C as a measure of educational attainment has led schools to focus specifically on getting students on the boundary between grades C and D to improve enough to get a C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24521957|title=School league tables widen to eight subjects|first=Sean|last=Couglan|publisher=BBC News|date=14 October 2013|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/mortarboard/2009/jan/15/schools-targets-culture|title=The targets culture in schools is missing the point|first=Donald|last=McLeod|publisher=The Guardian|date=15 January 2009|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Police Federation of England and Wales]] criticised the bureaucratisation of policing and argued that the use of targets increased the number of arrests made for petty offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6656411.stm|title=Police condemn 'target culture'|date=15 May 2007|publisher=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure and investigation of Stafford Hospital has been blamed on target culture by some. [[The Guardian]] report in an interview with an anonymous senior NHS doctor that Stafford Hospital "was a graphic illustration of the growing disconnect we see every day between a target-driven culture and the best interests of our patients".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2009/mar/19/nhs-targets-stafford-hospital|title='A hospital is able to tick all the boxes, yet still utterly fail patients'|first=Aida|last=Edemariam|date=19 March 2009|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the British Conservative Party politician [[Liam Fox]], writing for the website [[ConservativeHome]], lists Bristol Eye Centre as an example of the negative effects of a target culture: by trying to meet government targets to recruit more patients, they failed to make follow-up appointments with existing patients leading to some patients losing some or all of their eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conservativehome.blogs.com/centreright/2008/01/changing-our-la.html|publisher=ConservativeHome|title=Changing our Labour induced target culture|date=28 January 2008|first=Liam|last=Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tiered service''' structures allow users to select from a small set of tiers at progressively increasing price points to receive the product or products best suited to their needs. Such systems are frequently seen in the [[telecommunications]] field, specifically when it comes to [[Mobile network operator|wireless service]], digital and cable television options, and broadband internet access.&lt;ref name="tiered"&gt;Rouskas, G.N. (2009).'' Internet tiered services: Theory, economics, and quality of service.'' New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; 

When a wireless company, for example, charges customers different amounts based on the number of cellphone voice minutes, text messages, amount of data and other features they desire, the company is utilizing the principle of tiered service. This is also seen in charging different prices for services such as the speed of one's internet connection and the number of cable television channels one has access to. Tiered pricing allows customers access to these services who may not otherwise due to financial constraints, ultimately reflecting the diversity of consumer needs and resources.

Tiered service helps to keep quality of service standards for high-bandwidth applications like [[streaming video]] or [[VoIP]]. This comes at a cost of increasing costs for better service levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Boliek|first=Babette|title=Net Neutrality Regulation in the Mobile Telecommunications Market: A Cautionary Tale from the Era of Price Regulation|conference=3rd Annual Conference on Empirical Legal Studies Papers|date=October 2008|pages=10|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major players in the [[net neutrality]] debate have proposed tiered internet so content providers who pay more to [[Internet service provider]]s get better quality service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feamster|first=Nick |author2=Lixin Gao |author3=[[Jennifer Rexford]]|title=How to lease the internet in your spare time|journal=ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review|date=January 2007|volume=37|issue=1|pages=61–64|doi=10.1145/1198255.1198265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

It was not until the Internet began its rapid evolution that tiered services became a controversial issue. And it was not until the early 2000s that Internet carriers considered the option of abandoning [[net neutrality]] policies.&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Surowiecki|first=James|title=Net Losses; James Surowiecki on the dangers of tiered acces to the Web|journal=The New Yorker|date=20 Mar 2006|volume=82|series=5|pages=74|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/|accessdate=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the FCC changed the way [[Internet service provider|broadband service providers]] are regulated. This made broadband service providers "information services" instead of "telecommunications services". This means broadband service providers were no longer subject to [[common carrier]] regulations.&lt;ref name="choi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=Jay|author2=Byung Kim |title=Net Neutrality and Investment Incentives|journal=RAND Journal of Economics|year=2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=446–471|doi=10.1111/j.1756-2171.2010.00107.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the beginning of the twentieth century, common carriage guidelines required the quality of service must be the same for all users, preventing one customer from being favored over another.&lt;ref name = "ref" /&gt; During the first decades of the 1900s, this policy related directly to the telephone industry, and AT&amp;T specifically. However, in recent decades, the policy has grown to encompass a broader range of communication services. Preventing preferential treatment of customers in the realm of the Internet is referred to as the policy of net neutrality. 

In the US, the former chairman of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC), Michael Powell, considered net neutrality to be fundamental to the success of the Internet and he viewed it as one of the basic rules to maintaining freedom on the Internet.&lt;ref name= "ref"/&gt; The FCC continued its skepticism of tiered pricing for quite some time, and it was not until concerns about the availability of the spectrum began to surface that things began to change. In 2010, FCC Chairman [[Julius Genachowski]] announced that the benefits of tiered pricing include helping to prevent data backups on networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kang|first=Cecilia|title=FCC likely to back tiered pricing, analysts say|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/27/AR2010092706514.html?nav=emailpage|accessdate=13 April 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=28 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genachowski expressed his fear of a coming "spectrum crisis" as a result of the increase in smartphone usage ultimately clogging carrier networks. 

The FCC suggested a number of solutions to the problem including greater use of the unlicensed [[Wi-fi]] spectrum, more [[femtocells]], and more efficient arrangement of cellular towers, but even these measures were not believed to be enough to keep spectrum bands open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wireless Firms Weigh Metered Pricing|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T11726353933&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;startDocNo=26&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T11726800056&amp;cisb=22_T11726800055&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=295551&amp;docNo=30|accessdate=14 April 2011|newspaper=TechWeb|date=25 Aug 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempts have been made to put price controls on tiered service. [[United States Congress]] put a bill forth to prevent a "two-tiered pricing scheme with priority service." The bill did not pass Congress, but allowed the FCC to stop ISPs from blocking websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogendorn|first=Christian|title=Broaband Internet: net neutrality versus open access|journal=International Economics and Economic Policy|date=July 2007|volume=4|issue=2|pages=185–208|doi=10.1007/s10368-007-0084-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way ISPs tier services for content providers and application providers is through "access-tiering". This is when a network operator grants bandwidth priority to those willing to pay for quality service. "Consumer-tiering" is where different speeds are marketed to consumers and prices are based on the consumers willingness to pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kocsis|first=Victoria|author2=Paul Bijl |title=Network Neutrality and Competition between Network: a Brief Sketch of the Issues|journal=[[Intereconomics]]|year=2008|volume=43|issue=1|pages=15–24|doi=10.1007/s10272-008-0238-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Net neutrality==

[[Net neutrality]] is the practice of keeping Internet service providers from offering tiered service and controlling the ability to block out competition by restricting certain pipelines within the Internet. By blocking these pipelines, the provider creates an unfair transfer of packets across the Internet, diminishing the quality of service. Internet service providers seek to discriminate against [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) communication, [[FTP]], online games, and high bandwidth activities, such as video streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Svensson|first=Peter|title=Comcast Blocks Some Internet Traffic|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21376597/|accessdate=18 March 2011|newspaper=MSNBC|date=19 Nov 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is called [[bandwidth throttling]].

==Tiered Internet==

===Implications===
A tiered Internet gives priority to packets sent and received by end users that pay a premium for service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=two tiered Internet|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/two-tiered-Internet|accessdate=19 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network operators do this to simplify  things such as network management and equipment configuration, traffic engineering, service level agreements, billing, and customer support.&lt;ref name="george"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rouskas|first=George|author2=Nikhil Baradwaj |title=On Internet Tiered Service|pages=1–11|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiered service fair queuing===
[[Fair queuing]] is an algorithm that allows for network moderators to control packets by assigning flow weights.&lt;ref name="tiered" /&gt; Groups of guaranteed-service applications are classed by their nature (e.g. "voice","video","game") based on similar bandwidth and delay requirements. These guaranteed-service applications are given priority over best-effort applications which are limited by the access bandwidth available to the user.

===Continuous rate network model===
The continuous-rate network model allow users to request any amount of bandwidth necessary for their uses and the network must be able to provide any arbitrary amount requested. There must be mechanisms put into place by the network provider that allows for a distinguishing to be made for these arbitrary requests. This process can become almost impossible for traffic with a finite duration. Bandwidth requests are inherently variable in size, arrival time, and duration and creates link capacity across the continuous rate network to become fragmented. The network would then have much difficulty in maintaining a sufficient level of utilization and users’ expected quality of service.&lt;ref name="george" /&gt;

===Arguments===
Initial reasoning against tiered service was that ISPs would use it to block content on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Ken|title=AT&amp;T sees benefits to tiered Internet service|url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2006/01/5965.ars|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Internet Service Provider|Internet service providers]] could use this to prioritize affiliated partners instead of unaffiliated ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=two-tiered internet|url=http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/two-tiered-Internet|accessdate=15 March 2011|date=10 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many argue that one fast network is much more efficient than deliberately throttling web traffic to create a tiered Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Felten|first=Ed|title=How Would Two-Tier Internet Work?e|url=http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/how-would-two-tier-internet-work|accessdate=15 March 2011|date=18 Jan 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AT&amp;T===
[[AT&amp;T]] had a trial in 2008 in Reno, NV which was one of the first cases of tiered service for in-home broadband internet pertaining to the amount of data used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munchbach|first=A.|title=AT&amp;T hits Reno, NV with tiered broadband trials|url=http://www.bgr.com/2008/11/05/att-hits-reno-nv-with-tiered-broadband-trials/|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BT Group===
[[BT Group]], a British telecommunications giant, is now going to charge users of their service extra for faster delivery of content. Meaning that they will not be handling all traffic across their network equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manchester|first=L.B.|title=UK online service creates 'two-tiered' Internet, critics allege|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14752628,00.html|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tiered cellular data plans==

===AT&amp;T===
[[AT&amp;T]] revised their cellular data plans to create data tiers for specific types of usage. AT&amp;T indicated that tiered pricing may be brought on in the future for [[3GPP Long Term Evolution|LTE]] data plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ziegler|first=C.|title=AT&amp;T makes sweeping changes to data plans, iPhone tethering coming at iOS 4 launch|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/06/02/atandt-makes-sweeping-changes-to-data-plans-iphone-tethering-comi/|accessdate=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metro PCS===
[[MetroPCS]] has been accused of violating net neutrality by their proposed tiered cell phone data services. With some of these services being capped at a certain maximum, this violates various agreements for an open Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=L.|title=MetroPCS accused of blocking certain Net content|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20028252-38.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sprint===
[[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]] is implementing tiered data plans for their mobile broadband products. The plans come in 3GB, 5GB, and 10GB capacities. Sprint previously claimed to have unlimited service, as this is their first venture into tiered pricing schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lutz|first=Zachary|title=Sprint set to introduce tiered data for mobile broadband, steal candy from children|url=http://mobile.engadget.com/2011/05/03/sprint-set-to-introduce-tiered-data-for-mobile-broadband-steal/|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verizon===
[[Verizon Wireless]] introduced their LTE network with the capability for tiered services at the end of 2010. Because the company's 4G network is now available in cities across the United States, Verizon has the opportunity to charge premium prices for faster data delivery. Such data plans allow Verizon to charge under a tiered service platform, similar to many home wired Internet services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Verizon reviews LTE price options|journal=Global Telecoms Business|date=1 November 2010|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T11881120914&amp;format=GNBFI&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T11881001633&amp;cisb=22_T11881120919&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;selRCNodeID=20&amp;nodeStateId=411en_US,1&amp;docsInCategory=22&amp;csi=318069&amp;docNo=18|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
There are many arguments between ISPs, who traditionally support tiered services, and network neutrality proponents. ISPs state that tiered services are necessary to keep and maintain network performance. Also, tiered pricing schemes provide ISPs with an incentive to upgrade their networks and provide better service. Network neutrality proponents say that ISPs do not have the right to degrade Internet services to certain users and that their service should be open and consistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Brad|title=Net neutrality vs. tiered services|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2007/102607-arguments-net-neutrality-tiered-services.html|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verizon Communications|Verizon]] CEO, Ivan Seidenberg, expressed his concerns with network neutrality regulations saying that stricter regulations preventing tiered services ignore the "benefits of smart networks." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reardon|first=Marguerite|title=Verizon CEO slams Net neutrality|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30686_3-10379932-266.html|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, it was reported that both critics and proponents believe that the debate over net neutrality and tiered services has become increasingly more partisan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatch|first=David|title=Both Sides Overstate Case on Net Neutrality|journal=National Journal|date=14 Apr 2011|url=http://find.galegroup.com/gtx/retrieve.do?contentSet=IAC-Documents&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;qrySerId=Locale%28en%2C%2C%29%3AFQE%3D%28SU%2CNone%2C16%29%22net+neutrality%22%24&amp;sgHitCountType=None&amp;inPS=true&amp;sort=DateDescend&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;tabID=T002&amp;prodId=AONE&amp;searchId=R2&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;userGroupName=msu_main&amp;docId=A254148127&amp;docType=IAC|accessdate=4 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3705">'''Tommaso Ghirardi''' (born 10 May 1975 in [[Brescia]]) is an [[Italy|Italian]] businessman, mostly known for having served as chairman (of BoD) and owner of Italian [[association football]] club [[Parma F.C.]] from January 2007 to December 2014. His main activities are in the mechanics  industry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rdes.it/RDES_2_11_Baroncelli_Caruso.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

His entry into football came with the purchase of [[A.C. Carpenedolo]], a small club based near Brescia, when the club was in [[Serie D]]. The club turned professional and gained promotion to [[Serie C2]] in 2004 and marginally missed on promotion to [[Serie C1]] two years later after play-off defeat.

On 3 January 2007, Ghirardi bought financially troubled Parma F.C. in an auction for the sale of the club. He sacked [[Stefano Pioli]] after just two matches and replaced him with [[Claudio Ranieri]], but the club continued to struggle. Relegation seemed inevitable, but final day victory secured Parma's place in Italy's top division for the following season. He responded by investing around €11M on new players. Despite this, Parma were relegated to [[Serie B]] after nineteen consecutive seasons in the top flight.

Life in Serie B started worryingly under [[Luigi Cagni]], who was replaced by [[Francesco Guidolin]] and Parma would go on to secure promotion with two games of the season to go. The return to Serie A was the cue for the appointment of [[Pietro Leonardi]] as general manager and Andrea Berta (ex-colleague at Carpenedolo) as sporting director. A creditable eighth-place finish and the return of [[Hernán Crespo]] saw Ghirardi held in high regard by the fans. A lack of progression since has seen his stock fall.

In the first five years of Ghirardi's presidency (from January 2007 to January 2012), it was estimated that his investment had reached €30m, alongside a further €13m in the club's parent company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fcparma.com/index.php/leonardi-il-parma-volta-pagina/ |title=Leonardi: Il Parma volta pagina |trans-title=Leonardi: Parma turns a page |work=[[Parma F.C.]] |publisher=fcparma.com |language=Italian |date=9 January 2012 |accessdate=9 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709191930/http://fcparma.com/index.php/leonardi-il-parma-volta-pagina/ |archivedate=9 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 2014, Ghirardi announced he would resign as chairman of Parma F.C. and sell his stake in the club. He eventually sold his controlling holding to [[Cyprus|Cypriot]]-[[Russia]]n company Dastraso Holding Limited in December 2014.&lt;ref name="parma_ownership"&gt;{{ cite news |url=http://fcparma.com/news/parma-fc-alla-dastraso-holdings-limited-il-presidente-fabio-giordano-pagare-le-scadenze-e-non-retrocedere-le-nostre-priorita?lang=it |language=Italian |access-date=21 December 2014 |publisher=Parma FC |date=20 December 2014 |title=PARMA FC ALLA DASTRASO HOLDINGS LIMITED.

Due to his behaviours, he caused bankruptcy to the team, together with his CEO [[Pietro Leonardi]]. He will be submitted to judgement in the second half of 2015.
