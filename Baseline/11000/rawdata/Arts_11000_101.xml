During the '''1820s''' in European and European-influenced countries, fashionable women's clothing styles transitioned away from the classically influenced "Empire"/"Regency" styles of c. [[1795–1820 in fashion|1795–1820]] (with their relatively unconfining [[empire silhouette]]) and re-adopted elements that had been characteristic of most of the 18th century (and were to be characteristic of the remainder of the 19th century), such as full skirts and clearly visible [[corset]]ing of the natural waist.

The silhouette of men's fashion changed in similar ways: by the mid-1820s [[coat (clothing)|coats]] featured broad shoulders with puffed sleeves, a narrow waist, and full skirts. [[Trousers]] were worn for smart day wear, while [[breeches]] continued in use at court and in the country.

==Women's fashions==

===Overview===
[[File:Stieler - Amalie Auguste of Bavaria - Galerie Neue Meister.jpg|right|thumb|Evening dress of 1823 features short puffed sleeves and is worn with a patterned shawl]]
[[File:Frothingham Brooks.jpg|right|thumb|Ruffled collar and sheer linen cap, 1823]]
During the first half of the 1820s, there were slight gradual modifications of Regency styles, with the position of the waistline trending successively lower than the high waistline of the Regency (just below the breasts), and also further development of the trends of the late 1810s towards giving skirts a somewhat conical silhouette (as opposed to earlier more clinging and free-flowing styles), and in having various types of [[Trim (sewing)|decoration]] (sometimes large and ornate) applied horizontally around the dress near the hem. Sleeves also began increasing in size, foreshadowing the styles of the 1830s. However, there was still no radical break with the Empire/Regency aesthetic. Skirts became even wider at the bottom during the 1820s, with more ornamentation and definition toward the bottom of the skirt such as tucks, pleats, ruffles, or loops of silk or fur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Douglas A.|title=Costume History and Style|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc.|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-181214-9|page=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 1820s, this neoclassical aesthetic was decisively repudiated, preparing the way for the main fashion features of the next ten to fifteen years (large sleeves, somewhat strict corseting of the natural waist, full skirts, elaborate large-circumference hats, and visual emphasis on wide sloping shoulders).  Rich colors such as [[chrome yellow]] and [[rubia|Turkey red]] became popular, and fabrics with large bold checkerboard or plaid patterns became fashionable,&lt;ref&gt;Tozer and Levitt (1983), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takeda and Spilker (2010), p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; (another contrast with the previous fashion period, which had favored small delicate pastel prints). A [[bustle]] was sometimes also worn.  Belts accentuated the new defined waist.

Dresses were often worn with a round ruffled linen collar similar to a soft [[ruff (clothing)|Elizabethan ruff]].

===Hairstyles and headgear===
Early in the decade, hair was parted in the center front and styled into tight curls over the temples.  As the decade progressed, these curls became more elaborate and expansive. The bun on the back became a looped knot worn high on top of the head.  Wide-brimmed hats and hat-like bonnets with masses of feathers and ribbon trims were worn by mid-decade.

Conservative married or older women wore indoor caps of fine [[linen]] descended from the earlier [[mob cap]]; these had a pleated or gathered caul on the back to cover the hair, and a narrow brim at the front that widened to cover the ears and often tied under the chin.  These caps were worn under bonnets for street-wear.

Women also began to wear caps known as a cornette around 1816. These caps were tied under the chin and worn indoors. They also tended to be greatly adorned with plumes, ribbons, flowers, and jewels. Another alternative to the cornette was the turban, also often bejeweled and adorned, which shows the great interest in exotic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Geoffrey|title=Fashion Accessories Since 1500|year=1987|publisher=Unwin Hyman|location=London|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outerwear===

[[Shawl]]s remained popular.  [[Cloak]]s and full-length [[coat (clothing)|coats]] were worn in cold or wet weather.

===Shoes===

The fashionable shoe was a flat slipper. In the late 1820s, the first high shoe appeared and became vogue for both men and women. The shoe typically consisted of a three-inch high cloth top that laced on the inner side and a leather vamp that supported a long, narrow, and squared toe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=Turner R.|title=The Mode in Costume|year=1958|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York, NY|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
By the mid-1820s, men's fashion plates show a shapely ideal silhouette with broad shoulders emphasized with puffs at the sleevehead, a narrow waist, and very curvy hips.

A [[corset]] was required to achieve the tiny waistline shown in fashion plates. Already de rigueur in the wardrobes of military officers, men of all middle and upper classes began wearing them, out of the necessity to fit in with the fashionable gentry.  Usually referred to as "girdles", "belts" or "vests" (as "corsets" and "stays" were considered feminine terms) they were used to cinch the waist to sometimes tiny proportions, although sometimes they were simply whalebone-stiffened waistcoats with lacing in the back.  Many contemporary cartoonists of the time poked fun at the repressed nature of the tightlaced gentlemen, although the style grew in popularity nonetheless. This was the case especially amidst middle-class men, who often used their wardrobe to promote themselves, at least  in their minds, to a higher class — hence the [[dandy]] was born.

The emergence of wool as a primary fabric choice for men's outer garments led to a revolution in tailoring that allowed fit and finish to be of the utmost importance as opposed to ornamentation. This revolution allowed for an idealized classical silhouette to be materialized in men's fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollander|first=Anne|title=Sex and Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress|year=1995|publisher=Kodansha|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shirts and cravats===
[[Shirt]]s of linen or cotton featured tall standing [[collar (clothing)|collars]] and were worn with wide [[necktie|cravats]] tied in a soft bow.

===Coats and waistcoats===
Around 1820, coats began to be made in an entirely new way. The tails and lapels were cut separately and subsequently attached to the coat. This ensured a better fit, a greater following of the body's contours, and more consistent positioning, even when the coat was unbuttoned. The tails themselves were narrow, pointed, and fell just below the knee. The shoulders were broad and the coat stood of the chest, yet was snug at the waist. Coats also were padded at the chest and waist. The collars and lapels were also padded in order to stiffen them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohler|first=Carl|title=A History of Costume|year=1963|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York, NY|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The collars were high and shawl-like in order to frame the face. Coats were cut straight across the waist. Waistcoats were buttoned high on the chest.  Cutaway coats were worn as in the [[1795–1820 in fashion|previous period]] for formal daywear, but the skirts might almost meet at the front waist.

[[Frock coat]]s had the same nipped-in waist and full skirts. Very fashionable sleeves were gathered or pleated into a slightly puffed "leg of mutton" shape.  Coats could be made of [[wool]] or [[velvet]], and jewel colors like bottle green and midnight blue were high style.  [[Double-breasted]] coats were very much in fashion throughout the decade.

===Trousers and breeches===
Trousers underwent a notable change in the 1820s. The new fit was a product of the French Revolution as it was considered uncouth to wear attire that looked wealthy. The length of the pant changed from below the knee to below the ankle and the fit of the pant loosened slightly from the first decade of the 19th century. The pants featured a small waistline and flared out slightly at the hip with small pleats, creating the image of fullness in the hip region. The introduction of straps that went under the foot, known as [[stirrup pants]], also changed the shape and fit of these trousers.&lt;ref&gt;B. Payne, "Men's Wear in the Nineteenth Century", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Full-length light-colored trousers were worn for day; these were cut full through the hips and thighs, tapering to the ankles.  They were held smoothly in place by straps fastened under the square-toed shoes.  Dark trousers were worn for evening wear, and breeches were worn for formal functions at the [[United Kingdom|British]] court (as they would be throughout the century).  Breeches were also worn for [[horseback riding]] and other country pursuits, especially in Britain, with tall fitted boots.

===Hats and hairstyles===
Tall, silk hats again came into style. They were seen as a comfortable and light way to protect against sun and rain and were adequate for travelling and hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohler|first=Carl|title=A History of Costume|year=1963|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York, NY|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crowns of tall [[hat]]s also became curvy in keeping with the new style, and began to flare from the headband to the top.  Curled [[hair]] and [[sideburn]]s were fashionable.

===Shoes===
Rubber was introduced to Europe and America and created a shift in shoes from the pattens and clogs to the galosh. The galosh was soft and gummy in warm weather and hard and stiff in the cold. The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy looking, as though they were held on by suction cups, for the leather barely covered the toes and hardly gripped the heel.&lt;ref&gt;Kemper, Rachel H: "Costume", 1992, pp. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

{{French art history}}
'''19th-century French art''' was made in France or by French citizens during the following political regimes: [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s [[First Consul|Consulate]] (1799-1804) and [[First French Empire|Empire]] (1804-1814), the [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|Restoration]] under [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (1814-1830), the [[July Monarchy]] under [[Louis Philippe of France|Louis Philippe d'Orléans]] (1830-1848), the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]] (1848-1852), the [[French Second Empire|Second Empire]] under [[Napoleon III]] (1852-1871), and the first decades of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871-1940).

Many of the developments in French arts in this period parallel changes in literature.  For more on this, see [[French literature of the 19th century]].

For more on French history, see [[History of France]].

==Romanticism==
The [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic wars]] brought great changes to the arts in France.  The program of exaltation and mythification of the Emperor [[Napoleon I of France]] was closely coordinated in the paintings of Gros and Guérin.

Meanwhile, [[Orientalism]], Egyptian motifs, the tragic [[anti-hero]], the wild landscape, the [[historical novel]] and scenes from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, all these elements of [[Romanticism]] created a vibrant period that defies classicism.

[[Image:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|left|275px|[[The Massacre at Chios]] - Eugène Delacroix]]

One also finds in the early period of the 19th century a repeat of the debate carried on in the 17th between the supporters of Rubens and Poussin: there are defenders of the "line" as found in [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], and the violent colors and curves as found in [[Eugène Delacroix]].  The comparison is however somewhat false, for Ingres' intense realism sometimes gives way to amazing voluptuousness in his Turkish bath scenes.

Romanticism is a literary language based on feelings.  Writers who illustrated this concept included [[John Keats]] and [[Benjamin Constant]].  The Romantic tendencies continued throughout the century: both idealized landscape painting and [[Naturalism (visual art)|Naturalism]]  have their seeds in Romanticism: both [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]] are logical developments, as is too the late 19th century [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] of such painters at [[Gustave Moreau]] (the professor of Matisse and Rouault) or [[Odilon Redon]]. [[Auguste Rodin]] and [[Camille Claudel]] are the most famous sculptors of their time.

==Birth of the Modern==
[[Walter Benjamin]] called Paris "the capital of the 19th century".  In order to  understand the amazing diversity of artistic expressions which Paris gave birth to from the 1860s to all nightboulevards, but also replaced poorer neighborhoods and created fast routes to move troops through the city to quell unrest.  Yet there was also a second Paris at the limits of Haussmann's city on the hill of [[Montmartre]] with her windmills, cabarets and vineyards.  Café culture, cabarets, arcades (19th century covered malls), [[anarchism]], the mixing of classes, the radicalization of art and artistic movements caused by the academic [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] system, a boisterous willingness to shock &amp;mdash; all this made for a stunning vibrancy.  What is more, the dynamic debate in the visual arts is also repeated in the same period in music, dance, architecture and the novel: Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Proust, Nijinski, etc.  This is the birth of [[Modernism]].

[[Édouard Manet]] represents for many critics the division between the 19th century and the modern period (much like [[Charles Baudelaire]] in poetry).  His rediscovery of Spanish painting from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his exploration of the forthright nude and his radical brush strokes are the first step toward Impressionism.

[[Image:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''[[Impression, Sunrise]] (Impression, soleil levant)'' - Claude Monet]]

[[Impressionism]] would take the [[Barbizon school]] one further, rejecting once and for all a belabored style (and the use of mixed colors and black), for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors in changing light (in part inspired by the paintings of [[J. M. W. Turner]]).  [[Claude Monet]] with his cathedrals and haystacks, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] with both his early outdoor festivals and his later feathery style of ruddy nudes, [[Edgar Degas]] with his dancers and bathers.

Some of these techniques were made possible by new paints available in tubes.  These painters were also to a certain degree in a dialogue with another discovery of the 19th century: photography.

From this point on, the next thirty years were a litany of amazing experiments. [[Vincent van Gogh]], Dutch born but living in France, opened the road to expressionism.  [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Georges Seurat]], influenced by color theory, devised a pointillist technique that controlled the Impressionist experiment. [[Paul Cézanne]], a painter's painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world (that left many of his peers indifferent). [[Paul Gauguin]], the banker, found symbolism in [[Brittany]] and then exoticism and primitivism in [[French Polynesia]]. [[Henri Rousseau]], the self-taught dabbler, becomes the model for the naïve revolution.

'''''A Family Thing''''' is a 1996 film starring [[Robert Duvall]], [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Irma P. Hall]]. It was written by [[Billy Bob Thornton]] and [[Tom Epperson]] and directed by [[Richard Pearce (film director)|Richard Pearce]].

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=June 2016}}
The film is a drama about a [[Scotch-Irish American]] [[Southern United States|Southerner]] (Duvall) named Earl Pilcher, whose late mother makes a shocking revelation in a letter that is given to him after her death. She reveals that Earl's biological mother was a [[Black American]] maid named Willa Mae, who was raped by Earl's (white) father and that she died while giving birth to Earl. His adoptive mother's dying wish is that he go to [[Chicago]] to meet his half-brother, Raymond Murdock (Jones). 

Earl initially takes the unexpected news of his mixed parentage badly, tearfully challenging his father to confirm the facts in the letter. Old and feeble, his father refuses to discuss the letter, but admits it is true. As a result, Earl packs up his clothes and takes off for Chicago to find his brother.  

He meets Ray at city hall (where Ray works as a police officer) and Ray, although he really wants nothing to do with Earl, agrees to meet him for lunch at a diner. 

During lunch, Ray reveals that he knew all along that he had a half white brother and that he hates Earl's father (and Earl too by association) because he feels Earl's birth is what killed his mother.  He says in so many words that he doesn't want or need a brother, and they go their separate ways.  But when Earl leaves and drives off in his truck he encounters four black Chicago street toughs who rear end his truck.  When Earl gets out to survey the (minimal) damage, he, being a trusting Southern "good ol' boy", leaves his keys in the ignition. The toughs beat him up and steal his truck and his wallet.  He walks around in a daze and ends up in a hospital. The hospital staff finds Ray's information in Earl's pocket and calls Ray.  He comes reluctantly, and the doctor tells him that Earl may have a concussion and needs to take it easy for a couple of days; no traveling is allowed. She also tells him that the hospital is full, so he will have to take Earl home to recuperate.  

At Ray's home, Earl meets Aunt T (Hall), a kind and generous elderly woman who is blind. Aunt T. is Willa Mae's sister, and thus, Earl's aunt. 

Earl also meets Ray's son, Virgil (Beach), a surly and hostile city bus driver who doesn't appreciate a white southerner sleeping in his bed. At first, Earl's stay at the Murdoch residence is rocky. 

Ray explains that Earl is an old war buddy whose life he saved, but Virgil is skeptical.  During a grocery shopping excursion with Earl, Aunt T reveals that she knows who Earl really is.

In a powerful scene, Aunt T scolds Ray and Virgil for not welcoming a member of their family, no matter how different he is. Earl overhears the discussion and leaves Ray's house, walking unknowingly into a bad part of town.

Ray gives in to Aunt T's wish that he welcome Earl into their home, and he quickly locates him on a nearby street. Earl obstinately refuses to come back with Ray, knowing he is not wanted. The two argue, ending up in an awkward wrestling match, and Earl uses the word "nigger" to punctuate his disdain for Ray, seeing too late that he has gone too far. Angry at Earl's callous words, Ray tells Earl to stay away from him, and he heads back home.

Meanwhile, Earl wanders Chicago and gets drunk at a Chicago bar, where he is tossed out for bothering a black couple. He ends up sleeping under a bridge. The next day, Ray has cooled down and, again on Aunt T.'s wishes, manages to find Earl, who apologizes for his words and rude behavior. The two begin to settle their differences. 

When Virgil's estranged wife (played by [[Regina Taylor]]) and their two daughters visit, Earl learns that Virgil had a promising career in football that was shattered by an injury in college. Virgil cannot cope with the missed opportunities caused by his injury, and, the resulting bitterness has hurt his relationship with his family.

Ray and Earl bond together more as they find similarities between them. Both served in the military (Earl as a firefighter in the [[United States Navy]], and Ray in the [[U.S. Marines]]) during the [[Korean War]], where they received lifelong scars.

Ray reveals that as a child, he once threw a rock at Earl that could have blinded him, because of Ray's hatred towards Earl's father.

Later on, in a bar, Earl takes Virgil aside and explains to him that by dwelling on the loss of his football career, he isn't devoting himself to his wife and children in the way he should. Both of them begin to have a grudging respect for the other.

Once Earl is ready to go home, and the police unexpectedly find his truck operational (it was shot up in a bank robbery), Aunt T. sits Earl and Ray down to tell them the dramatic tale of the night Earl was born and Willa Mae died.

According to Aunt T., Willa Mae knew she was likely to die and Earl's life was saved only by the quick action of his adoptive mother, Carrie, who brought a white doctor to the shack where Willa Mae and Ray lived to help with the delivery.

Aunt T speculates that Carrie and Willa Mae agreed that Earl, who was born with white-appearing features, should be raised by Carrie and his biological father. Aunt T. gives Earl a picture of Willa Mae which he keeps near.  Earl begins to accept his new family with pride, and he convinces Ray to return to their Arkansas hometown to find their mother's grave. As they share a drink on her tombstone, Earl decides to take Ray to meet his southern family and tell them the unlikely story, ending the movie by joking with Ray that when Earl's ''white'' nephew finds out he is part black, he will likely want to fight the both of them.

'''''A Garden of Glass''''' refers to a [[stained glass window]] in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk, Amsterdam]], designed and installed for the [[silver jubilee]] of [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] in 2005, by the artist Marc Mulders.

In 2004 the National Committee for the Silver Jubilee of Queen Beatrix was formed.&lt;ref name="overheid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0016368/2004-02-18|title=Regeling - Instellingsbesluit Nationaal Comité Zilveren Regeringsjubileum Koningin Beatrix - BWBR0016368|website=wetten.overheid.nl|accessdate=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee settled on a stained glass window in the Nieuwe Kerk as a fitting memorial as that is the location where the Queen was inaugurated.&lt;ref name="NRC"&gt;[https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2005/04/29/ramen-mulders-tekenen-onze-tijd-10488593-a146729 "Ramen Mulders tekenen onze tijd"], ''[[NRC Handelsblad|nrc.nl]]'', 29 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The window is made up of 40 individual panels that include various mushrooms, flowers and butterflies.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; It hangs opposite the commemorative window from 1995 celebrating 50 years of freedom.&lt;ref name="NRC"/&gt; A book was published the same year by Lien Heyting about the window, explaining the symbolism of the various figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/tuin-van-glas-herdenkingsraam-zilveren-regeringsjubileum-koningin-beatrix-2005/oclc/993519991 Een tuin van glas herdenkingsraam Zilveren Regeringsjubileum Koningin Beatrix 2005], on [[worldcat]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales''''' is a [[1995 in literature|1995 book]] by [[neurologist]] [[Oliver Sacks]] consisting of seven medical case histories of individuals with neurological conditions such as [[autism]] and [[Tourette syndrome]]. ''An Anthropologist on Mars'' follows up on many of the themes Sacks explored in his earlier book, ''[[The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat]]'', but here the essays are significantly longer and Sacks has more of an opportunity to discuss each subject with more depth and to explore historical case studies of patients with similar symptoms. In addition, Sacks studies his patients outside the hospital, often traveling considerable distances to interact with his subjects in their own environments. Sacks concludes that "defects, disorders, [and] diseases... can play a paradoxical role, by bringing out latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life that might never be seen, or even be imaginable, in their absence" (p. ''xvi'').

==Essays==
*"The Case of the Colorblind Painter" discusses an accomplished artist who is suddenly struck by [[cerebral achromatopsia]] or the inability to perceive color due to brain damage.
*"The Last Hippie" describes the case of a man suffering from the effects of a massive [[brain tumor]], including [[anterograde amnesia]], which prevents him from remembering anything that has happened since the late 1960s. Sacks' discussion of the case includes a comparison with [[Phineas Gage]], the American railroad worker who survived for eleven years after an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head. 
*"A Surgeon's Life" describes Sacks' interactions with Dr. Carl Bennett, a [[surgeon]] and amateur [[aviator|pilot]] with [[Tourette syndrome]]. The surgeon is often beset by [[tic]]s, but these tics vanish when he is operating. 
*"To See and Not See" is the tale of [[Shirl Jennings]], a man who was [[blindness|blind]] from early childhood, but was able to recover some of his sight after surgery. This is one of an extremely small number of cases where an individual regained sight lost at such an early age, and as with many of the other cases, the patient found the experience to be deeply disturbing.
*"The Landscape of His Dreams" discusses Sacks' interactions with Franco Magnani, an artist obsessed with his home village of [[Pontito]] in [[Tuscany]]. Although Magnani has not seen his village in many years, he has constructed a detailed, highly accurate, three-dimensional model of Pontito in his head.
*"Prodigies" describes Sacks' relationship with [[Stephen Wiltshire]], a young [[autistic savant]] described by [[Hugh Casson]] as "possibly the best child artist in Britain."
*"An Anthropologist on Mars" describes Sacks' meeting with [[Temple Grandin]], an autistic woman  who is a world-renowned designer of humane [[livestock]] facilities and a professor at [[Colorado State University]]. The title of this essay comes from a phrase Grandin uses to describe how she often feels in social interactions.

The 1999 film ''[[At First Sight (1999 film)|At First Sight]]'' is based on the fourth essay, "To See and Not to See". The Brian Friel play ''[[Molly Sweeney]]'' was also inspired by this essay. The 2011 film ''[[The Music Never Stopped]]'' is based on the second essay, "The Last Hippie".

[[File:Praia-Palácio Presidencial (1).jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Presidential Palace, one of the most renowned buildings in Cape Verde]]
The '''Architecture of Cape Verde''' has different architectural styles in the nation.  Unlike the African mainland, Cape Verde was uninhabited until 1461 when the Portuguese arrived, most of the other islands were first inhabited after the end of the 15th century.  Its architecture was introduced in the 1460s and has its first origins from Portuguese settlers from the Madeira Islands, after the first arrival of mainland Africans, a bit of African architecture would be elements mainly in rural areas. The Manueline was its first architectural style on the island, it was later followed by Renaissance, Baroque, Pombaline (late-Baroque and Neoclassical), Early Modern and Modern.  It was one of the last in the whole of Africa to introduce architecture late.  Cape Verde has one of the richest architecture in the western portion of West Africa, the sub-Saharan portion, the richest probably being Mali.

After independence, modern architecture along with African continued to be influenced in newer buildings and is now the dominant influence on its buildings in the nation today, in its newer resorts particularly in Sal features a mixture of Spanish, African, probably Mexican and Moorish elements of architecture including the Garupa and the Funana hotels, both owned by RIU.  Also [[Aristides Pereira International Airport]] has a mixture of African, Capeverdean and Arabic-Moorish architecture.

The nation also has several buildings and homes with a resemblance of Portuguese and mainland African architectural origins.

==Architectural styles==
Its main architectural styles includes [[funco (architecture)|funco]], dominant on the islands of Fogo, Santiago and Maio, [[loja (architecture)|loja]], used for bars and [[sobrado (architecture)|sobrado]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbosa.acthus.com/historiasobrados.html|title=Acthus.com|website=Barbosa.acthus.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a house style particularly founded in the city of São Filipe in Fogo.  In the Colonial times, the funco style were mainly used for blacks, the loja style were once used for the mixed people and the sobrado style were for the white people used before independence.

==Colonial architecture==
{{Commonscat|Portuguese colonial architecture in Cape Verde}}[[File:Cidade Velha-Igreja Nossa Senhora do Rosário (1).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nossa Senhora do Rosário (Our Lady of Rosary) church, the first colonial church in the world and the sub-Saharan portion of West Africa]]The first 500 years would have mainly Portuguese elements in its architecture and continued until the independence of Cape Verde in 1975.

===Manueline architecture===
When the city of Ribeira Grande (now [[Cidade Velha]]) was enlarged in its early years in the 1450s, in the 1490s and the start of the 15th century, [[Manueline style|Manueline architecture]]  would be featured in its buildings.  Some of its styles survived in some buildings in [[São Filipe, Cape Verde|São Filipe]].  The town's pillory (not a building) is one example, the other was [[Nossa Senhora do Rosário church (Cidade Velha)|Nossa Senhora do Rosário church]], the world's first colonial church and the Sé Cathedral.  After the [[Cassard expedition]] of 1712, all of its buildings were destroyed.  Its ruins remain on a few. By the 20th century, there were rebuilt in different locations and these buildings are part of UNESCO's [[World Heritage Site]] since 2009.

===Renaissance and Mannerist architecture===
[[File:ForteSFilipeQuarteis.JPG|thumb|left|300px|Ruins of the São Filipe fort]]Most of Cidade Velha's 500 buildings until the destruction of the French featured Renaissance and Mannerist architecture, it included the churches of São Roque, São Pedro, Monte Alverne, Nossa Senhora da Conceição,  the chapel of Santa Luzia, and the church and hospital of Santa Casa de Misericórdia.

[[Fort Real de São Filipe]] built on Achada de São Filipe sobre Ribeira Grande, a fort built in 1585 to protect from further attacks from corsairs after the damages during the [[Capture of Santiago (1585)|raid by Sir Francis Drake]], it was restored in 1968 and in 1999.  Minimal architectural changes occurred with the [[Philippine Dynasty|Habsburg Philippine Dynasty]] in the Portuguese Empire which included Cape Verde for sixty years.

===Restoration and Early Baroque architecture===
Fortim Carlota in São Filipe, Fogo are one of the buildings, a fortress featuring Restoration era architecture.  The Convent of Saint Francis (São Francisco) in Cidade Velha was built in the mid-16th century, it was destroyed by the French in 1712 during a raid and has been restored.

===Pombaline architecture===
====Late Baroque architecture====
[[Ribeira Grande, Cape Verde|Ribeira Grande]] has examples of late 18th century architecture in the center of the city.

As the colonial capital of Praia was moved in 1770, some architectural buildings were added including the warehouses and the port office, late Baroque Pombaline architecture appeared in Praia, almost all of these would be demolished by around the late 19th century and were replaced by neoclassical buildings.  Only the warehouse survives today which is in Praia da Gamboa.

Other examples is São Filipe's Our Lady of Conception church ( ''Nossa Senhora da Conceição'') which was built in a comparatively simple style at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=lipps&gt;Susanne Lipps: ''Kapverdische Inseln'', p. 253-254. Ostfildern 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Opposite the church there are several well-preserved colonial houses dating from the 18th century.  Another one was the Pedra de Lume saltworks built in the early 20th century and its residential complexes.

====Neoclassical architecture====
[[File:Palacio Governador (S Vicente, Cabo Verde).JPG|thumb|300px|Palácio do Povo, Mindelo which serves as the center of the administration of the island, it features an Indian building style, its walls and fences are colored in pink]][[File:São Filipe-Musée municipal (4).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Museu Municipal de São Filipe, located in what was a sobrado style house]]
Neoclassical architecture dominated the building styles from 1822 up to the start of the 20th century, its most prominent were in Praia, the [[Platô]] and Mindelo.  Praia underwent large modernization by the colonial governor [[João da Mata Chapuzet]], one of the buildings he designed was [[Quartel Jaime Mota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asemana.publ.cv/spip.php?article63659&amp;ak=1|title=Como estragar uma bela Praça|newspaper=A Semana|language=pt|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=7 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the buildings features roofs detached from its walls, common in Portugal and the Portuguese Empire at the time.
As [[Mindelo]] flourished in the mid to late 19th centuries with its coal refueling and telegraph services, numerous Pombaline and neoclassical architecture appeared across Mindelo. notable examples include [[Centro Nacional de Artesanato]] (founded as Centro de Artesanato), [[Palácio do Povo]] which features Indian style architecture with its walls and fences in pink, today which serves as the center of the island's administration and offices, others are [[Fortim d'El-Rei]] built in 1852 and used as a defense of Porto Grande and the city, the Mindelo Cultural Center, Mindelo Library, the old barracks, a replica of Lisbon's Torre de Belém, [[Paço do Concelho]], Liceu Gil Eanes, the former British consulate, the French Cultural Center, bandstands or kiosks of Praças Estreia and Amilcar Cabral and the Mindelo Cathedral of Our Lady of Grace.
[[File:Museu da tabanca, Assomada, Cape verde.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Museu da Tabanka, Assomada]][[File:Ponta do Sol 2.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Center of Ponta do Sol with its decorated street along with buildings with colonial architecture, one of them has modern architecture today]]
Other notable examples include those in Praia, the [[Praia, Cape Verde (municipality)|Praia City Hall]] and the buildings around [[Praça Alexandre Albuquerque|Albuquerque square]] (also the 12 de Setembro Square) including the kiosk, Escola Grande and its buildings around Loreno Square, [[Museu Etnográfico da Praia]], [[Pro-Cathedral of Our Lady of Grace, Praia|Praia Cathedral]], the former [[Banco Nacional Ultramarino]] (BNU) Praia branch which is now the headquarters of [[Banco Comercial do Atlântico]], Hospital Agostinho Neto (first as Praia Hospital), Praia Maria and Boutique hotels, Palácio Cultural Ildo Lobo, the building where [[Quintal da Música]] is located and most of all the [[Palácio Presidencial|Presidential Palace of Cape Verde]] with its luxuriant garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Lesourd|first=Michel|title=Le Cap-Vert|publisher=Jaguar|place=Paris|page=75|isbn=978-2-86950-408-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Fogo in São Filipe including one that is now Casa de Memória, the town kiosk which is also used as a bandstand and the [[Museu Municipal de São Filipe]] featuring a traditional hut&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barbosa.acthus.com/historiasobrados.html|title=Ilha do Fogo - Históroa dos sobrados|trans-title=Fogo Island - History of Sobrados|website=Barbosa.acthus.com|accessdate=2017-09-09|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the municipal halls of Paul and Ribeira Grande.
[[File:Espargos- Sal.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The city center of Espargos founded as Preguiça, its first buildings features early modern architecture as the town was founded in the late 1940s]]

Other cities featuring late Pombaline and neoclassical architecture across Cape Verde are in the centers of Paul (Pombas), [[Ponta do Sol, Cape Verde|Ponta do Sol]], [[Porto Novo, Cape Verde|Porto Novo]], built when it was called Carvoeiros, [[Ribeira Brava, Cape Verde|Ribeira Brava]], [[Tarrafal de São Nicolau]], a few in [[Santa Maria, Cape Verde|Santa Maria]], [[Sal Rei]], [[Cidade do Maio]], [[Pedra Badejo]], [[Assomada]], [[Calheta de São Miguel]], [[Tarrafal, Cape Verde|Tarrafal]], [[Cova Figueira]], [[Mosteiros, Cape Verde|Mosteiros]], [[Furna, Cape Verde|Furna]], [[Fajã de Agua]] and [[Nova Sintra]] and villages including [[Rabil, Cape Verde|Rabil]] and [[Povoação Velha]], both on Boa Vista.

Other churches built that time included [[Nossa Senhora da Conceição church (Boa Vista)|Nossa Senhora da Conceição church]] located near Povoação Velha.

In the late 19th century, numerous lighthouses were built across Cape Verde and feature colonial architecture; notable ones includes [[Farol de D. Maria Pia|Farol de Ponta Temerosa]] in Praia, [[Farol de Fontes Pereira de Melo|Farol de Ponta Tumbo]] near Janela and Porto Novo, [[Farol de D. Amélia|Farol de São Pedro]] southwest of Mindelo which has a rectangular building, Sal's [[Farol da Ponta Norte]] and [[Farol da Ponta do Sinó]].  [[Farol de Pedra de Lume]], built in 1853 is a lighthouse that is also a chapel that has a white exterior, made out of tile and black and white horizontal bands painted on the roof and the edges, around it serves as a diurnal marking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imieiviaggi.info/capoverde/cv11.jpg|title=Image with a primitive tower and the diurnal marking|website=Imieiviaggi.info|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later neoclassical architecture in other parts of Praia are seen in Fazenda and [[Gamboa, Praia|Gamboa]] including the [[Electra (company)|Electra]] offices.

Today, some or most of the buildings in the Platô neighborhood have been demolished and replaced with newer buildings including [[Banco de Cabo Verde]]'s headquarters and the colorful buildings in the middle of [[Avenida Andrade Corvo]].

Building projects slowed at the early 20th century which was led by drought and rain shortages across Cape Verde at the time.

===Late colonial and early modern architecture===
Early modern architecture started to appear in newer buildings in the 1930s such as art nouveau.  During the time, [[Raul Pires Ferreira Chaves]] was director of public works for Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, he also lived in Cape Verde for some years, he did architectural works including the terminal and facilities of the Sal International Airport (now known as [[Amílcar Cabral International Airport]]), [[Farol de Fiúra]] in the north point (Ponta Norte) of Sal, an urban plan for the square now known as 5 do Outubro in Praia.

There were hardly any building projects in Cape Verde during the Great Depression and the Famine of the 1940s and remained up until the 1950s.

A town founded for airport services, the center of Espargos once known as Preguiça features late colonial and early modern architecture, one of its buildings is the Sal Municipal Hall.

Several Mormon and Protestant churches built before independence have modern architecture.

Other buildings built during that time included Estádio da Fontinha (now [[Estádio Municipal Adérito Sena]]) in Mindelo and Liceu Domingos Ramos in the north of the plateau.  Seminaro de São José, located near Ponta Temerosa, Praia was also built during that time.

==Modern architecture==
After independence, as the population grew, a lot of buildings featuring modern architecture (or modernism) spread up and many buildings today have a flat roof as other modern buildings on the African mainland.  Many houses and some buildings have little, poor or no architecture today.  One of these were a building that is now part of the [[University of Cape Verde]], its main campus in [[Palmarejo]] and other buildings in the new section of Palmarejo.
[[File:Hotel Riu 1 (Sal, Cabo Verde).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Funaná Hotel, an example of modern architecture which features African, Spanish, probably Mexican and Moorish elements]]
Other areas with buildings that contain only modern architecture includes the towers of [[Gamboa, Praia|Gamboa/Chã das Areias]] in the center of Praia and nearby.  Another is an information pavilion near [[Barragem de Poilão]] in the middle of the island of Santiago.  Escola Jorge Barbosa and Hotel Porto Grande, both are in Mindelo also features modern architecture.  Constructed in the late 1990s, one of the most notable is the [[National Library of Cape Verde|National Library]] located in Várzea in the center of Praia.  The other is the headquarters of the [[Bank of Cape Verde]] in the Plateau, being one of the first glass buildings.

After the end of the 20th century, modern architecture are featured in several sports stadiums including the [[Estádio Marcelo Leitão]] in Espargos built in 2003, [[Estádio Municipal Arsénio Ramos]] in Sal Rei built in 2008 and [[Estádio Municipal do Porto Novo]] in 2009.  Also in some resorts and vilas, Afro-Moorish architecture appears in Santa Maria (Funana, Garupa) and near Sal Rei (Karamboa, also features Arabesque architecture) along with a mixture of modern Afro-Northern Mediterranean architecture in places like Ribeira do Rabil southeast of Sal Rei and Murdeira, Sal.  One of the recent international airports constructed was the [[Aristides Pereira International Airport]], the airport of Boa Vista Island located in Rabil.  Its style is a mixture of Portuguese origin and Moorish architectural elements and has peach-rose stone bricks with two arches, entrance and exit doors and a yellow exterior where the airport name is and in the south are three melon colored exteriors with two fudge-brown exteriors in between and are bordered with a stone-brick outer wall.

===In parts of the island of Fogo===
[[File:Chã das Caldeiras-Maison traditionnelle (1).jpg|thumb|left|300px|One notable example was a hut (known as [[funco]]) in Chã das Caldeiras featuring traditional architecture, its bricks were made out of lava]]One of the unique architecture on Fogo was [[Chã das Caldeiras]] which has building material made out of lava, most of the buildings were built after independence especially the southwest part which were rebuilt after the 1995 eruption.  Its architecture is not only of Portuguese origin but contain elements of mainland African styles such as old traditional huts and a circular plan as those in mainland African villages and towns and had only one story.  It had straw roofs, bricks mainly black made out of lava, straw windowpanes and doors  In other parts of Cape Verde, only a very few village have hut style buildings.  Huts covered a quarter of the village.  One of the most notable were a house with blue exterior walls with white facades, brown windowpane and door and on the bottom triangular bricks, painted houses did not dominate the majority of the village, another was a hut that housed the vineyard offices, The other was the Catholic church of Portela which had a circular roof, two rims and green doors.  Some of the houses were rectangular with windows and some narrow doors and detached roofs, some buildings also had a flat roof.  One other examples were the village's primary school which had stucco walls, white roofs and mostly white doors and some brown, nearby had a playground with its benches built out of lava, the other was Vinho do Fogo, where wine is manufactured, a small bungalow was in the middle with two small flat windows on each side, black-grey bricks made out of lava, wide doors  and on the right is a part of the building, the others are outside but sheltered and a near rectangular café with sky blue exterior walls, windows and three narrow doors.

Almost the whole of the village were destroyed by lava flows of the 2014-15 eruption between November and February, several survive with minimal or moderate damages, a few were unharmed.

In early 2016, newer buildings and huts were built and out of lava and some new inhabitants moved in.

The rare architectural style's project was awarded the National Architecture Award in 2013, as Best Project of the Year and was awarded the Archdaily Building of the Year International Award in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fernandoguerra.exposure.co/cabo-verde|title=Fernando Guerra - Cabo Verde on Exposure|website=Fernandoguerra.exposure.co|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere on Fogo, some of the buildings built out of lava have good architecture and some of these are in the east of São Filipe.

'''Atamira Dance Company''' is a creator and presenter of [[Māori people|Māori]] contemporary dance theatre in [[Aotearoa]] ([[New Zealand]]). ''Atamira'' means to showcase or platform.
The company was founded in 2000 by Jack Gray, Dolina Wehipeihana, Louise Poitiki Bryant and Justine Hohaia. The company is based currently in Corban Estate Arts Centre in [[Waitakere City|Waitakere City, New Zealand]].
&lt;ref name="atamiradance"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atamiradance.co.nz/|title=ATAMIRA Maori Contemporary Dance Company -|author=@URL|publisher=atamiradance.co.nz|accessdate=2014-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company takes their personal stories and that of their whakapapa to relate to Aotearoa's history and touch on significant contemporary issues. Atamira typically means stage however a more in depth meaning to the word relates to the process of caring for those who have died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://danz.org.nz/atamira.php DANZ article on Atamira] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327094506/http://danz.org.nz/atamira.php |date=27 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2000, the company was founded as a response to the community need for a platform for Māori urban identity. They create works that aim to reach out to the audiences, and reflect the aspirations of many Māori people and  their ''mana whenua'' (maori rights). All dancers and choreographers involved with the company have links to New Zealand iwi.

In 2007 Atamira formed the Atamira Dance Collective Charitable Trust to promote Māori contemporary dance.

In 2010 Moss Patterson was appointed as the first Artistic Director. 

In 2014 They are currently creating the fifth series of 'Hou' (meaning ''new'').

===Founders===
The company was created in 2000 by Jack Gray with core members Dolina Wehipeihana, Louise Poitiki Bryant and Justine Hohaia. The four met during 1999 while Gray and Wehipeihana were studying contemporary dance at UNITEC, subsequently becoming acquainted with Hohaia and Bryant at a tertiary dance festival. At that point Bryant was studying Māori Studies at [[University of Otago]] and Hohaia at Wellington’s New Zealand School Of Dance. Upon meeting Gray, Wehipeihana and Hohaia, Bryant saw their love of dance and decided it was time for her to follow her passion too, and gave up her studies to transfer to the dance programme at UNITEC.

==Artistic director==
The current artistic director is Moss Patterson.
Patternson began his performance career as a musician composing and performing in [[Dunedin]]. This led him to study acting at The New Zealand College of Performing Arts and then on to study dance and choreography at UNITEC School of Performing and Screen Arts in Auckland.

Patterson has danced and choreographed for Atamira Dance Company, Black Grace Dance Company, Footnote Dance Company and Touch Compass. He is often compared to the Limbs dancer [[Alfred Williams]] when he dances. 

He has choreographed Te Paki, Haka, Te Whenua, Whakairo and Moko for Atamira Dance Company. In 2007, Patterson was awarded Best Choreography by TEMPO Dance Festival and Best New Choreographer in the NZ Listener for Whakairo.

Patterson was recognized for his major role as associate choreographer for the [[Rugby World Cup 2011]] Opening Ceremony and Sacre The Auckland Dance Project with the Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2012, Patterson made Poutama with the [[Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra]] and Moko with Atamira. During 2014 he has made Te Manu Ahi (The Firebird) with Auckland Philharmonic Orchestra to premiere on 22 October 2014.

Patterson has been the co-recipient of the CNZ Tup Lang Dance scholarship with Atamira Dance Company and the Te Whakahaungia choreographic award by [[Toi Māori Aotearoa]]. He is a regular speaker at local and national events and is a passionate advocate for Māori culture and Māori contemporary dance in New Zealand.

The '''Australian Horror Writers Association (AHWA)''' is a [[non-profit organisation]] that commenced in 2003 with the goal of providing a unified voice and sense of [[community]] for [[Australian]] writers of dark fiction ([[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[dark fantasy]]) and to further the development of dark fiction in [[Australia]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
The AHWA built to some extent on the work of previous horror writers' associations in Australia such as the Sydney-based Gargoyle Club (1987–92)(see [[Leigh Blackmore]]) and the Melbourne-based Australian Horror Writers (1994-1998) (see [[Bryce J. Stevens]]), which grew out of [[Bloodsongs]] magazine (its president being [[Bryce J. Stevens]], and its newsletter/journal ''Severed Head'' having been edited first by Stevens, then Aaron Sterns). However, the AHWA was a far more ambitious effort, conceived by its founding committee as drawing together horror writers and fans nationwide in Australia.

The AHWA was officially launched during the Continuum 3 [[science fiction convention]] in [[Melbourne]] on 17 July 2005 by [[author]] [[Richard Harland]]. [http://www.australianhorror.com/index.php?view=6]

The founding committee members were Dr Marty Young (President), [[Kirstyn McDermott]] (Vice President), Mick Piemontese (Secretary), Carl Schaller (Treasurer), James R Cain and [[Angela Challis]]. [http://www.australianhorror.com/index.php?view=6]

In 2005, the AHWA established the [[Australian Shadows Award]] as an annual [[literary award]] to honour the best published work of [[horror fiction]] written or edited by an Australian. The award was sponsored by Altair Australia Books in its first two years, through the donation of two statuettes created by dark fantasy artist Brom (supplied by The Franklin Mint).

Other projects established by the AHWA include the Southern Horror [[Yahoo! Groups|Yahoo! Group]] mailing list for members, an annual [[flash fiction]] and [[short story]] competition (winning entries are published in ''Midnight Echo'' magazine), online chatrooms and forums, a Market Hive (markets database for current horror fiction markets), an annual [[mentorship]] programme, and ongoing story critiquing groups.

Renowned Australian horror &amp; ghost story anthologist James Doig has provided the AHWA website with a historical checklist of important Australian horror and fantasy works. [http://www.australianhorror.com/index.php?view=141]

The AHWA also maintains links with the [[British Fantasy Society]] and [[Horror Writers of America]].

The AHWA news service was amalgamated with [[Brimstone Press]]'s [[news]] and [[review]] [[webzine]] [[HorrorScope (webzine)|HorrorScope]] between March 2007 and Sept 2010. With AHWA news editor Talie Helene joining the HorrorScope editorial team, the combined serviced provided a single, streamlined source for Australian horror publishing news until early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ozhorrorscope.blogspot.com/2007/03/news-ahwa-newshorrorscope-collaboration.html Cummings, Shane Jiraiya (March 2007). "AHWA/HorrorScope collaboration". ''HorrorScope''.] Retrieved 9-9-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Midnight Echo'' magazine==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
AHWA produces a regular print publication ''Midnight Echo'' (Oct 2008 - ). It is designed to showcase the best in Australian horror writing, though it also publishes work by non-Australian writers. The magazine began as a PDF publication with limited hardcopies being printed outside Australia. As from Issue 5, the hardcopy magazine is printed in Australia by [[Black House Comics]].

The Executive Editor of ''Midnight Echo'' Issues 1-5 was Australian author Scott Wilson. [[Leigh Blackmore]] became Acting Executive Editor with Issue 5. Previous President Dr Marty Young returned to the AHWA as Executive Editor for ''Midnight Echo'' in Sept 2011 in time for the release of Issue 6. Marty Young launched the new Midnight Echo website in Oct 2011.

Each issue is edited by a different editor or editorial team drawn from AHWA's membership. The Art Director for Issues 1-3 was David Schembri. On Issue 5 the Art team consisted of Juliet Bathory and David Schembri. Issue 5 was the first issue printed entirely in Australia.

Colour cover artwork has featured on all issues from Issue 1 onwards. Issues 1 and 2 contained no poetry or colour internal artwork. Poetry was featured prominently alongside fiction in Issue 3, which was also the first issue to include a graphic novel (in black and white).

Individual issues of ''Midnight Echo'' have been edited by
* Kirstyn McDermott and Ian Mond (Issue 1, Oct 2008))
* [[Angela Challis]] and [[Shane Jiraiya Cummings]] (Issue 2 (June 2009))
* Stephen Studach (see [[The Australian Horror and Fantasy Magazine]]) (Issue 3 (Nov 2009))
* [[Lee Battersby]] (Issue 4 (July 2010)
* [[Leigh Blackmore]] (Issue 5, Feb 2011).
* [[David Conyers]], [[Jason Fischer (writer)|Jason Fischer]] and David Kernot (Issue 6, Nov 2011)
* Daniel I Russell (Issue 7, May 2012)
* Marty Young, Mark Farrugia, and Amanda J Spedding (Issue 8, November 2012)
* GN Braun AKA Geoff Brown (Issue 9, May 2013)

==AHWA officeholders==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
In Sept 2010 all committee positions of the AHWA were declared vacant and new officeholders were elected. [[Leigh Blackmore]] replaced Dr Marty Young as the organisation's second President and served in that role for the year 2010-2011.

==Mission==

CBC Arts has a mission to inspire Canadians to engage with the arts — whether that means visiting a gallery, checking out a play, joining a choir or picking up a good book. Their definition of "art" is expansive: from your local hip-hop cypher or yarn-bombing collective to fine art auctions and contemporary opera to the flowering of creativity on the web and social media — it's all fair game.

[[Image:inside grid2.jpg|thumb|Inside view]]

The '''Caseros Prison Demolition Project &amp;mdash; 80,000 Tons''', which contains ''16 Tons'' and ''Aparecidos'' is the work of artist [[Seth Wulsin]]. It uses the defunct [[Caseros Prison]] of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] and its demolition as [[raw material]]s.

''Aparecido'' is the past participle for the Spanish verb ''aparecer'' - to appear. Its second meaning is [[Vision (spirituality)|apparition]] or [[ghost]]. It may also refer in an oblique way to Argentina's Dirty War, in which an estimated 30,000 people, "Desaparecidos"  were disappeared between 1976 and 1981 by the military junta, many of them thrown from airplanes into the Rio Plate.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

''[[Sixteen Tons]]'', the name of a popular song written in the late 1940s, referred to the amount of coal a miner was expected to load in a day, but in this context may refer to the amount of glass broken out through the installation, or de-installation, process.

80,000 tons is the approximate weight of the entire building, and the debris that the demolition produced.

==The demolition==
On a basic level, the demolition of the prison, contracted out by the city government of [[Buenos Aires]] to the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[military]], was the seed for the artwork. The building was slated for demolition in 2001, but the process was subject to various legal, environmental and bureaucratic roadblocks. The original plan was to implode the building in three steps. But the implosion was stopped at the last minute by a group of neighbors concerned about the possibility of damaging environmental effects, including asbestos poisoning and the possibility of driving millions of rats out of the tunnels underneath the prison. Caseros was demolished by mechanical means floor by floor from the top down between 2003 and 2008. The cost of demolishing the prison, and thus the budget for the artwork, was estimated at somewhere between one and three million dollars.

== The grids ==

The window grids on the north end of the former prison provided the [[wikt:locus|locus]] and point of entry for the work. Each grid was approximately {{convert|17|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|9|ft|m}} wide. Breaking out certain windows, Wulsin created faces in each of the 48 outer grids on the building. Each grid consisted of 11 x 19 (209) circular semi-[[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] windows, eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  in [[diameter]]. The windows that remained reflected the light of the sky, the sun and the moon, producing images from certain angles that were completely a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of space and light—the dark interior space of the prison, and the light shining through the [[optics|optically]] reflective space of the remaining windows.

The pictorial space of each image was directed at different points on the ground where the sun reflecting in the windows was visible. The viewing angles changed throughout the year as the sun's [[elevation]] in the sky changed.

In addition to the 48 outer window grids, there were also 48 grids facing inward, directly opposite the outer grids. They didn't reflect the light of the sun from any possible viewing angles on the street, but the artist worked with them as well, using morse code to embed messages in the window grids.

The window grids were already in various stages of decomposition when Wulsin found the building, with almost a third of the total number of windows already broken out by inmates during various [[prison riot]]s when the jail was still in use.

The cycle of appearance and disappearance that took place according to the daily, monthly and yearly [[moon|lunar]] and [[sun|solar]] cycles, and the position of the potential viewer was underscored at a larger magnitude by the demolition process, which consisted in the removal of the building from the top down, floor by floor. The demolition lasted until March 2008, with the majority of the rubble taken to a fill in the River Plate at Costanera Norte near Jorge Newbury Airport.

After discovering the prison in January 2006, while exploring the neighborhood of [[Parque Patricios]], where he'd recently moved from [[New York City]], Wulsin spent four months navigating the bureaucracies of the national and city governments of Argentina and Buenos Aires, respectively, to gain authorization to enter the building and carry out the onsite work. The resolution authorizing the project was finally signed on Friday, June 16 ([[Bloomsday]]), 2006 by Minister of Public Works of the city of Buenos Aires, Juan Schiavi. The security tarp made by Wulsin to direct broken glass back inside the building was blue and white, and painted with the hot air balloon logo of the local Parque Patricios soccer team [[Huracan]]. The five weeks of onsite work were completed on [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s birthday, July 28. But the project itself was ongoing through the entire demolition process of the building.

[[File:Casting Cats.jpg|thumb|Casting call for [[black cat]]s, Los Angeles, 1961. The studio was seeking cats for the [[Roger Corman]] movie ''[[Tales of Terror]].'']]

In the [[performing arts]] industry such as [[theatre]], [[film]], or [[television]], a '''casting''' (or '''casting call''') is a [[pre-production]] process for selecting a certain type of [[actor]], [[dancer]], [[singer]], or [[extra (acting)|extra]] for a particular role or part in a script, [[screenplay]], or [[teleplay]]. This process is typically utilized for a motion picture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion Pictures|url=https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/motion-pictures/|date=December 14, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006161746/https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/motion-pictures/|archivedate=October 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[television program]], [[documentary]], [[music video]], [[play (theatre)|play]], or [[television advertisement]], etc. This involvement in a dramatic production, [[advertisement]], and or [[industrial video]] is intended for an [[audience]], or [[studio audience]].

==Casting process==
The casting process involves a series of [[audition (performing arts)|audition]]s before a casting panel, composed of individuals within a [[theatrical production]] such as [[theatrical producer]], and [[theater director]]. However, within a given [[Television program#Production|television production]] a casting panel can consist of a [[television producer]], or within [[filmmaking|film production]] a casting panel could contain a [[film producer]], [[film director]], and/or [[choreographer]]. Usually, in nearly all areas of [[show business]], a casting director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Does a Casting Director Do?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-mcclanaghan/what-does-a-casting-direc_b_9799558.html|date=Apr 29, 2017|publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526020009/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-mcclanaghan/what-does-a-casting-direc_b_9799558.html|archivedate=May 26, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is on this panel as well. In the early stages of this process [[performers]] often may present, or are presented with prepared ''audition pieces'' such as [[monologue]]s, [[song]]s, choreography, scripts and or sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sides|url=http://dictionary.tdf.org/sides/|date=Feb 25, 2015|publisher=''[[Theatre Development Fund ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517122705/http://dictionary.tdf.org/sides/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These audition pieces are usually video taped, typically in the form of [[screen test]]s and then attached with resumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I add my resume and more information about myself?|url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?proaddresume|date=May 21, 2017|publisher=''[[IMDb]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[head shot]]s and or viewed online via websites such as [[IMDb]], then shared with film producers, film directors and or [[studio executive]]s. Later stages may involve groups of [[actors]] both union, ([[SAG-AFTRA]]) and non union depending on the size and scope of the production, attempting to read material from the work under consideration, paired off in various combinations of two, three or more. With each of the actor's overall [[motivational]] choices evaluated, the casting panel considers both the individual actor, and the ''chemistry'' created from either one of the combinations set forth within the [[read-through]], such as boy meets girl, etc.

Within the production of a prestigious work under consideration for film or television, and depending on the difficulty in finding a lead or supporting actor for the role, such as with the casting of the [[biopics|biopic]] films Notorious,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notorious|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198/|date=January 16, 2009|publisher=''[[IMDb ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512175935/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198/|archivedate=May 12, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straight Outta Compton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Straight Outta Compton - Number One Movie of the Summer|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-number-one-movie-of-the-summer/|date=August 20, 2015|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307235934/https://socialbilitty.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-number-one-movie-of-the-summer/|archivedate=March 7, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and All Eyez on Me,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Eyez on Me|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666185/|date=June 16, 2017|publisher=''[[IMDb ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519114240/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666185/|archivedate=May 19, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; casting calls may go out into the general public at large, this is referred to as a Cattle Call&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cattle Call|url=https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/cattle-call/|date=December 15, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213081649/https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/cattle-call/|archivedate=February 13, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (typical for [[community theater]]), to professional and semi-professional local actors where a similar process is followed (for supporting roles in [[theater]] and [[film]]) or for specifically selected actors (for leading roles, especially in films).

A more robust version of this painstaking task can be made through the Breakdown Services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown Services|url=https://www.breakdownservices.com/|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Services]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517203341/http://www.breakdownservices.com/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded by former actor Gary Marsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headshot Cafe interview with Gary Marsh (founder of Breakdown Services)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwqFMEPVTpk|date=Jul 8, 2013|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510155907/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwqFMEPVTpk|archivedate=May 10, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Breakdown Services|url=https://breakdownservices.com/index.cfm/main/about|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Services]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522044320/http://breakdownservices.com/index.cfm/main/about|archivedate=May 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 40 years ago. This was due to the difficult logistics issues for agents to get their actors submitted for acting roles from [[major film studio]]s and casting directors.

This casting breakdown service provides a complete character breakdown of various scripts and projects from production companies for film, television, [[print modeling|modeling]], commercials etc., to only agencies and managers who meet certain criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How can we contact casting directors or film directors in Hollywood as an aspiring actor?|url=https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-contact-casting-directors-or-film-directors-in-Hollywood-as-an-aspiring-actor/answer/Shaunti-Griffin?srid=hDjAD|date=May 12, 2017|publisher=''[[Quora]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These agents and managers are positioned all over the world, and subscribe to this service that literally has an entire suite of services for just about every aspect of the breakdown, for a monthly service subscription fee. This suite includes services such as Breakdown Express,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown Express|url=https://www.breakdownexpress.com/index.cfm|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Express ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515155826/http://breakdownexpress.com/index.cfm|archivedate=May 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offer representatives, casting and those who subscribe, a quicker way to post projects themselves. Another more limited version of the breakdown service, also for a monthly subscription fee is called Actors Access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actors Access|url=http://www.actorsaccess.com/|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Actors Access]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520075705/http://www.actorsaccess.com/|archivedate=May 20, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where acting can subscribe to what is only made available to them, more like an entry level acting position, like [[under-five]], or a [[bit part]], a great tool for the actor whom is without an agent or manager.

An actor may go through several casting calls before receiving a part, and even though well known actors or actresses oftentimes still go through this very necessary process, some are privileged enough to have well known [[writer]]s, [[screenwriter]]s and or directors /producers [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] a project for their intent to be cast in a role. The well known actor or actress oftentimes negotiates producer [[Credit (creative arts)|credit]] as well as very lucrative monetary compensation.

Independent casting studios like Film Independent who hosts the annual [[Independent Spirit Awards]] and the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] are often utilized for casting calls so that auditions can take place in one location, as well as possible affiliated various locations saving valuable time, energy and money. 

===What Casting Directors Actually Do===

For some major productions, the process of selecting actors for sometimes hundreds of speaking parts and roles, may often require a specialized staff. While the last word remains with the people in charge such as the director, producer, artistic departments and overall production team, a '''casting director'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twinkie Byrd - Casting in the 21st Century|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2017/03/twinkie-byrd-casting-in-the-21st-century/|date=March 24, 2017|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214074029/https://socialbilitty.com/2017/03/twinkie-byrd-casting-in-the-21st-century/|archivedate=December 14, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "CD" (and sometimes the casting associate) is in charge of most of the daily work involved in this process during [[pre-production]]. A casting director is sometimes assisted by a casting associate; productions with large numbers of extras may have their own extras casting director as well, however in all aspects of a film or television production's budget, they are all a part of the [[Above-the-line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]], answering to the director as part of his or her staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Descriptions for Film, Video &amp; Cgi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Job_Descriptions_for_Film_Video_Cgi.html?id=gv8MAAAACAAJ&amp;hl=en|date=May 21, 2017|publisher=''[[Google Books]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "CD" remains as a liaison between director, actors and their agents/managers and the studio/network to get the [[character (arts)|character]]s in the script cast. Some casting directors build an impressive career working on numerous [[Hollywood]] productions such as [[Marion Dougherty]], [[Mary Jo Slater]], [[Mary Selway]], [[Lynn Stalmaster]], [[April Webster]], [[Tammara Billik]], [[Marci Liroff]], [[Avy Kaufman]], [[Mindy Marin]], and [[Robi Reed]].

At least in the early stages of casting and or extras casting such as with casting agency [[Central Casting]], the process may be decentralized geographically, often in conjunction with actual shooting planned in different locations. Another reason may be tapping into each home market in the case of an [[international co-production]]. However, for the top parts, the choice of one or more beautiful people, whose presence is of enormous commercial importance, may rather follow strictly personal channels, e.g. direct contact with the director. During this time known as the "attachment phase" of a film, the casting director's job is to send out copies of the current script to agents for what is known as coverage. Coverage is when a script yet to be cast is read, summarized into a one-pager, and a brief set of character descriptions established. At this time, if an agency agrees to give coverage to a film, they will submit a list of ideas to the casting directors of actors available, capable, and in the price range of the film. Also, casting directors create their own&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182731144|title=Self-management for actors : getting down to (show) business|last=Bonnie.|first=Gillespie,|date=2009|publisher=Cricket Feet Pub|isbn=9780972301992|edition=3rd |location=Los Angeles, CA|oclc=182731144}}&lt;/ref&gt; idea lists and can "check avails" or call the actor representation to see if they are available and interested in taking on potential projects. If an idea that is generated from a casting director and a subsequent avail check or from an agent's recommendation is "approved" by the director, producers, and financiers (or studio), the casting director sends out what is called an "Offer." The offer, usually contains a letter to the actor's representative explaining the role in question, a copy of the script, why the actor has been selected, the length of time commitment, the approximate start date of filming, the filming location, and the proposed salary offering. If the actor does not respond to the material or for whatever reason cannot accept the job, they respond to casting with what is called a "pass." If they accept the offer, the agent engages the casting director and a deal memo is sent from casting to the representative. It is at this time when negotiations between agency and production happen to finalize any deal points before the entertainment lawyers step in and draw up the attachment contracts. If this process happens very early on in the development of a movie but the official shoot dates and details are not yet known, a Letter of Intent or "LOI" is drafted, to indicate, if and when the project is "green lit" or begins active production, the actor is already hired to portray that particular role. 

After the attachment phase is complete (which depends on many factors -- including but not limited to: financial backers, studio heads, availability of other above the line personnel), the physical auditions begin for all of the remaining roles. During this time, depending on the budget of the film, they could have what is called "pre-screens" where you audition only for a casting director (or associate) to see if the actor is right for the material. After pre-screens would be a "director session", during this time the actor comes in and auditions (usually with the same material) and now performs for the casting director and the film director. If there is a next step, it is usually a "callback" or producer session, where anyone who has decision making power is in the room for your audition. In television, this phase is referred to as a "screen test" and Network Executives would also be in attendance.  Once actors are selected from the pool of available actors, the same booking process that happens in the attachment phase takes place for any actor except extras.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The resulting list of actors who were selected to play a [[Character (arts)|character]] for a production, is called a [[cast list]], which is incorporated into a [[production company]]'s [[daily call sheet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Call Sheet on a film production?|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/AdHVgcm6ShVa0O6QBzSKUyej3F9s9hbwxymib5y-vI4CPDpfvYfevQI/|date=September 8, 2016|publisher=''[[Pinterest]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reflected in the projects [[title sequence]] especially with film and television.

=== Casting Office Personnel ===
'''Readers:''' This person reads all other character's lines opposite the actor who is currently auditioning. A good reader is someone who has acting skills, but who has no interest in booking a role through that casting director's office at that time. A reader will know how to give and take and play with other actors without ever outshining the auditioning actors.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; 

'''Interns:''' Interns are more common to commercial casting offices which host as many as a dozen different casting directors holding different auditions per day. While some commercial casting offices hold permanent casting space, many rent out studios on a project to project basis. A key intern will work with many busy casting directors sorting mail, copying sides and transcribing them onto "cue cards" or large boards to be read off of as prompts in the casting room, help actors sign in, and keep the flow of actors going in and out of the casting room as smooth as possible.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

'''Casting Assistants:''' This is the entry level position in the field of casting. These people go above and beyond the call of duty of your typical office assistant. They do everything from covering phones, to making copies, setting up audition (aka "session") equipment like lights, the camera, sound equipment, etc. They sometimes can be found in the office relaying audition appointments, checking actors avails, or in the casting room making sure the recording software is running smoothly so the Casting Director can focus on each actor's performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

'''Casting Associates:''' Associates is the second [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] in a casting office. Once a casting associate has worked for two years in the field of casting, they can apply for membership in [[Casting Society of America]]. Typically, the work under a Casting Director running pre-read sessions, prepping deal memos, and doing any calls to agents. Many associates begin to take on smaller scale projects so they can amass enough credits to move up in rank in CSA to a full-fledged Casting Director.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Casting Director:''' Their job is to know a lot about a lot of actors, so that they can advise and present to the director the best of the existing possibilities. Casting directors are highly influential and is usually on the project because the director trusts their judgements. They are also the ones who decides who the director does see. Good casting directors "discover" actor by carefully setting it up so that the director and producer will feel as if they've made the discovery of the new young actor. On the occasion when the director or producer does not respond to the actor presented, they must keep in mind that they aren't directing the production, the director is the one who's going to have to work with that actor-- therefore, it is casting's responsibility to delicately balance between showcasing the actor available to them and the director and producer's sensibilities, tastes, and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47813908|title=Audition : everything an actor needs to know to get the part|last=Michael.|first=Shurtleff,|date=1980|orig-year=1978|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=0553272950|edition=Bantam |location=New York|oclc=47813908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Casting Society of America]] (CSA)===
The significant organization of professional screen, television, reality, and theater casting in the US is the [[Casting Society of America]] (CSA), but membership is optional.  Casting directors organized in 2005 and became members of a collective bargaining unit, the [https://www.ht399.org/ Hollywood Teamsters Local 399] and [https://teamster.org/locals/local-817 New York Teamsters Local 817].

=== [[Artios Awards]] ===
The highest honor a casting director can receive is awarded by their peers in the [[Casting Society of America]]. ''Artios'', comes from the Greek word meaning, "perfectly fitted." The Artios award excellence in casting for all genres of casting except commercials. The Artios are currently held mid-January annually with ceremonies in New York, Los Angeles, and (beginning in 2018) London. Since their incarnation in 1985, they were held in November but were moved in 2013-2014 season to align with the rest of the film and television industry's awards season. The Artios is awarded to those CSA members who receive primary screen (or program) credit for casting on the winning project. Location Casting Directors, Casting Executives and Department Heads who are CSA members and who receive credit on winning projects also receive an Artios Award. CSA Associates on those projects are recognized in the press and with a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.castingsociety.com/awards/artios|title=Artios Awards|website=www.castingsociety.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102213058/http://www.castingsociety.com/awards/artios|archivedate=2013-11-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25762">The '''Collins &amp; Milazzo Exhibitions''' were a series of art exhibitions curated by the team [[Tricia Collins]] and [[Richard Milazzo]] mainly in New York in the 1980s. They also were co-editors and co-publishers of the art theory magazine [[Effects : Magazine for New Art Theory]].

In 1984,  Collins &amp; Milazzo began working together as curators to transform the group show into a critical statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bard.edu/news/releases/pr/fstory.php?id=2537] Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College Receives Donation of the Papers of Influential Curator Tricia Collins&lt;/ref&gt; Collins &amp; Milazzo brought to prominence a new generation of artists in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Pearlman, ''Unpackaging Art of the 1980s'', University of Chicago Press, 2003, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; It was their exhibitions and writings that originally fashioned the theoretical context for a new kind of [[Post-conceptual art]] that argued simultaneously against [[Neo-Expressionism]] and Picture-Theory Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allanmccollum.net/allanmcnyc/Collins_Milazzo.html] Allan McCollum interview with Collins &amp; Milazzo&lt;/ref&gt; It was through this context that the work of many of the artists associated with [[Neo-Conceptualism]] (or what the critics reductively called ''Simulationism'' and ''Neo Geo'') was first brought together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specificobject.com/objects/index.cfm?search_type=basic&amp;search=Tricia%20Collins%20%2F%20Richard%20Milazzo] Collins &amp; Milazzo at specific object&lt;/ref&gt;

Donggwoldo is on a [[folding screen]] (''byeongpung'') made of paper, silk and wood. The creation date is presumed to be between 1826 and 1830 given the fact that it depicts the "Jeonsa" [pavilion], installed in the 26th year of [[Sunjo of Joseon|King Sunjo]],&lt;ref name="ocp" /&gt; and "Gyeongbokjeon" [pavilion], demolished in the 30th year of the same king. The author is unknown but presumed to be a royal painter from [[Dohwaseo]], the governmental office in charge of paintings during the period. The [painting] itself is regarded more as a significant source for the research on Korean royal palaces rather than for its artistic values. Since the [picture] is visually more detailed than other similar paintings, such as ''[[Donggwoldohyeong]] (東闕圖形)'' and ''[[Gunggwolji]] (宮闕志)'', it serves well as historical evidence and provides many clues to studies on building arrangements and features during that period.&lt;ref name="ocp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EncyKorea" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CHA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=C&amp;i=221250&amp;v=42|script-title=ko:동궐도 東闕圖|publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Cultural Heritage Administration]]|language=Korean|accessdate=2009-10-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610070523/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=C&amp;i=221250&amp;v=42|archivedate=2011-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Electronic Visualisation and the Arts''' conferences ('''EVA Conferences''' for short, aka '''Electronic Information, the Visual Arts and Beyond''') are a series of international interdisciplinary conferences mainly in Europe, but also elsewhere in the world, for people interested in the application of information technology to the cultural and especially the [[visual arts]] field, including [[Art gallery|art galleries]] and museums.&lt;ref&gt;Online: Electronic imaging, the visual arts and beyond. ''[[New Heritage]]'', 05.02:7, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1484">The '''Eadred Reliquary''' was one of the wide-ranging [[Art forgery|art forgeries]] produced by [[Shaun Greenhalgh]] and his family, of [[Bolton, Greater Manchester]]. 

In 1989, Shaun Greenhalgh's father, George, tried to sell to [[Manchester University]] a supposed 10th-century Anglo-Saxon silver [[reliquary]], containing a small piece of wood which he claimed was a fragment of the [[True Cross]].&lt;ref name=codger/&gt; He said he had found the vessel while [[metal detecting]] in a park in [[Preston, Lancashire]].

Shaun, who had crafted the object, intended it to resemble a known missing Anglo-Saxon piece, dating back to the time of [[Eadred]], the [[King of England]] from 946 to 955. The [[British Museum]] decided that the reliquary was not genuine,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/jan/28/ukcrime.art "'The Antiques Rogue Show'"]. ''The Guardian''. 28 January 2008.

'''Elisabeth Thuillier''' (fl. 1890s-1920s) was a French colourist who ran a workshop in Paris where her employees [[Film colorization#Hand colorization|hand-coloured]] early films and photographic slides using her plans and colour choices. She is remembered especially for the work she did for the director [[Georges Méliès]].

== Colourist ==
Thuillier had experience in colouring slides for [[magic lantern]]s, and in other kinds of photographic and colour work. Her workforce had started colouring film by 1897.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt; This cinematic work was still new and it was given last place in the following description of her exhibit for the Paris ''[[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]]'' in 1900. Its length reflects the importance of Thuillier's business.&lt;ref name=Toulet&gt;{{citation|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5446181q/f8.image|language=French|first=Emmanuelle|last=Toulet|title=Le cinéma à l'Exposition universelle de 1900|journal=Revue d'histoire moderne et contemporaine|volume=XXXIII|date=April 1986|pages=182–183|quote=Couleurs et coloris. Matières premières colorantes. Photographies négatives et positives, sur papier, sur verre, sur soie, sur cuir, sur parchemin celluloïd. Épreuves stéréoscopiques sur verres, et vues à projections en couleurs. Photochromie et photographies artistiques en couleurs. Coloris de films pour cinématographe.|jstor=20529217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Colours and colouring. Raw materials for tinting. Negative and positive photographs, on paper, on glass, on silk, on leather, on celluloid parchment. Stereoscopic prints on glass, coloured slides. Photochromy and artistic colour photographs. Film colouring for cinematography.''&lt;ref name=Toulet/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Exposition'' jury awarded her a bronze medal.&lt;ref name=Toulet/&gt;

Thuillier hired more than 200 employees, all women, to handle the film commissions her workshop undertook. In a 1929 interview, she recollected spending her nights selecting colours and trying out samples.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Thuillier described her colours for film as "fine" [[aniline dye]]s, creating transparent and luminous tones. These dyes were dissolved first in water and then in alcohol. Each colourist was assigned a single tone, tinting specific parts of each frame before passing the film on to the next worker, in [[assembly line]] fashion.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Some areas to be coloured were so small that a paintbrush containing only a single horsehair was used.&lt;ref name=Kizirian/&gt;

Thuillier and her workers probably used four basic dyes: orange, a cyan-like blue-green, magenta, and bright yellow. These could be mixed to create other colours. The tones produced also changed depending the shade of grey of the film underneath.&lt;ref name=Essai&gt;{{citation|chapter=Avertissement|last1=Malthête-Méliès|first1=Madeleine|last2=Quévrain|first2=Anne-Marie|last3=Malthête|first3=Jacques|pages=5–11|title=Essai de reconstitution du catalogue français de la Star-Film; suivi d'une analyse catalographique des films de Georges Méliès recensés en France|location=Bois d'Arcy|publisher=Service des archives du film du Centre national de la cinématographie|year=1981|isbn=2903053073|oclc=10506429}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some films used more than twenty distinct colours, and all the work was done by hand.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{citation|first=François|last=Mazeline|journal=L'Ami du Peuple|date=13 December 1929|title=Mme Thullier nous rappelle… le temps où le cinéma ne manquait pas de couleurs}}. Quoted in {{citation|first=Georges|last=Mélies|title=Allocution au gala Méliès|date=October 1982|journal=Les dossiers de la cinémathèque|pages=34–36|url=http://collections.cinematheque.qc.ca/en/articles/allocution-au-gala-melies}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The workshop was at 87 Rue du Bac, Paris.&lt;ref name=Images&gt;{{citation|first1=André|last1=Gaudreault|first2=Germain|last2=Lacasse|first3=Jean-Pierre|last3=Sirois-Trahan|journal=24 images|issue=78-79|pages=79-84|year=1995|title=À Montréal, des sujets hauts en couleur, dès 1897...|url=https://www.erudit.org/culture/images1058019/images1082512/24302ac.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Thuillier's recollections, her studio typically produced about 60 coloured copies of each film they took on. For 300 metres of hand-coloured film, the cost was about 6 or 7 thousand francs per copy.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

== Clients ==
[[File:Trip to the Moon Selenite on Shell.jpg|thumb|Restoration of original hand-coloured frame from Méliès' ''Trip to the Moon'']]
Thuillier handled all colouring work on Méliès' films from 1897 to 1912.&lt;ref name=Yumibe/&gt; Thuillier's work on Méliès's films was international; for example, the American distribution company [[Selig Polyscope]] negotiated with Méliès to have its prints shipped to France to be coloured by Thuillier's workers.&lt;ref name=Kizirian&gt;{{citation|title=The Color of Silents|first=Shari|last=Kizirian|work=Keyframe|publisher=[[Fandor.com]]|url=https://www.fandor.com/keyframe/the-color-of-silents|accessdate=17 June 2016|date=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her business was also used by [[Pathé]], but she called off an agreement to work exclusively for them when she realised she would have to share authority with a Mme. Florimond whose husband was a key employee there.&lt;ref name=Yumibe&gt;{{citation|last=Yumibe|first=Joshua|title=Moving Color: Early Film, Mass Culture, Modernism|location=New Brunswick, NJ|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2012|pages=84, 166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpvymkXtt1AC&amp;pg=PA84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another customer was experimental film-maker [[Raoul Grimoin-Sanson]].&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;

The pioneering director [[Segundo de Chomón]] was not a client but was introduced to Thuillier's techniques of hand-colouring through his wife [[Julienne Mathieu]]. Mathieu (Mme. Chaumont or Chomón) had worked in the Thuillier workshop, as a supervisor according to some sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.larevuedesressources.org/des-tresors-de-films-dans-le-domaine-public-europa-film-treasures,2479.html|title=Des trésors de films dans le domaine public. Europa Film Treasures|work=La Revue des Ressources|date=29 January 2013|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as acting in silent movies. Chomón soon moved on to adding colour with stencils.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;

== Later life ==
Thuillier's hand-painting proved to be a slow, expensive way of colouring reels of film, and the world of cinema moved towards using stencils instead of freehand colouring; this was more efficient for multiple copies.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{citation|last=Yumibe|first=Joshua|chapter=French Film Colorists|editor-first1=Jane|editor-last1=Gaines|editor-first2=Radha|editor-last2=Vatsal|editor-first3=Monica|editor-last3=Dall'Asta|title=Women Film Pioneers Project|publisher=Center for Digital Research and Scholarship, Columbia University Libraries|year=2013|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/essay/french-film-colorists|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last client for Thuillier's colouring techniques was [[Georges Dufayel]],&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; whose impressive department store ''Grands Magasins Dufayel'' housed a cinema and other attractions. In her 1929 interview, Thuillier expressed regrets about the disappearance of her craft.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

In December 1929, she was invited to a gala given in Méliès' honour at [[Salle Pleyel]].&lt;ref name=Melies/&gt; Several films were shown, including ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''. For this event, "extremely delicate" colour restoration work was undertaken by two of Thuillier's "pupils", according to ''Cinéa'' magazine. Since the original negatives had been destroyed, the women removed the colour from old positive copies of the films, made new negatives, then new positives, and re-coloured those.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=L'Activité cinégraphique|journal=Cinéa|date=15 December 1929|page=26|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5739062d/f25.item}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Thuillier remarked to the press that if she had had sufficient time, she would have done the work herself.)&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; Méliès introduced her in his speech at the gala as an "eminent artist" who did her work with a "remarkable talent".&lt;ref name=Melies&gt;{{citation|first=Georges|last=Mélies|title=Allocution au gala Méliès|date=October 1982|journal=Les dossiers de la cinémathèque|pages=34–36|url=http://collections.cinematheque.qc.ca/en/articles/allocution-au-gala-melies}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The audience applauded and called "bravo".&lt;ref name=mage&gt;{{citation|first1=Maurice|last1=Bessy|first2=Lo|last2=Duca|title=Georges Méliès, mage|location=Paris|publisher=Prisma|year=1945|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about Thuillier's non-professional life. On her business letterheads she was Mme. B. Thuillier,&lt;ref name=Images/&gt; and was described as a widow around 1900.&lt;ref name=Toulet/&gt; In the 1920s she withdrew from Paris to "the provinces".&lt;ref name=mage/&gt;

'''Feminist views on [[BDSM]]''' vary widely from rejection to acceptance. BDSM refers to bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and Sado-Masochism. In order to evaluate its perception, two polarizing frameworks are compared. Some feminists, such as [[Andrea Dworkin]] and [[Susan Griffin]], have stated that they regard [[BDSM]] as a form of [[violence against women|woman-hating violence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffen|first=Susan|title="Sadomasochism and the Erosion of Self:A Critical Reading of Story of O" in [[Against Sadomasochism: A Radical Feminist Analysis]]|year=1982|location=East Palo Alto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|title=Woman Hating|year=1974|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other feminists, such as [[Gayle Rubin]] and [[Patrick Califia]], perceive BDSM as a valid form of expression of [[human female sexuality|female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Jaclyn|title=Yes Means Yes: Visions of Female Sexual Power and a World without Rape|year=2008|publisher=Seal Press|location=Seattle|isbn=1-58005-257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lesbian feminists practice BDSM and regard it as part of their sexual identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sana Loue |author2=Martha Sajatovic |author3=Keith B. Armitage |title=Encyclopedia of Women's Health|year=2004|pages=363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical relationship between feminists and BDSM practitioners has been controversial.  The two most extreme positions reflect those who believe that feminism and BDSM are mutually exclusive beliefs, and those who believe that BDSM practices are a fundamental expression of sexual freedom. Much of the controversy is left over from the [[feminist sex wars]] (acrimonious debates over sex issues) and the battle between the [[Anti-pornography feminism|anti-pornography feminists]] and the [[pro-sex feminist|pro-pornography feminists]].

== History ==

=== 1970s ===
In the 1970s, many different divisions of the feminist movement emerged.   As Andrew McBride writes, "During the 1970s, much of the discourse in the feminist movement was dominated by discussions of [[lesbian feminism]]. Toward the end of the decade, however, the conversations within feminism began to focus on a new topic: sexuality. This included sexuality of all types, not just lesbian sexuality. Included in the discussions and debates were heterosexuality, pornography, sadomasochism, butch/femme roles, and sex work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McBride|first=Andrew|title=Lesbian History:  The Sex Wars|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/lesbian.history/the_sex_wars|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lavender Menace]] and their concept of [[The Woman-Identified Woman|the woman identified woman]] and the [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]] both came out strongly believing that engaging in BDSM play was contradictory to being a feminist. [[Samois]], a San Francisco-based lesbian BDSM group, maintained that feminists could engage in BDSM without being hypocritical.

=== 1980s ===
During the 80s, this sex war continued and reached the attention of several academics who attempted to dissect why such a division had occurred. Ardill and O'Sullivan explained the history using the conflict in the [[London Lesbian and Gay Centre|London Lesbian and Gay Center]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ardill|first=S|author2=O'Sullivan, S|title=Upsetting an applecart: Difference, desire and lesbian sadomasochism|journal=Feminist Review|year=2005|volume=80|pages=98–126|doi=10.1057/palgrave.fr.9400223}}&lt;!--|accessdate=8 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar conflicts were continuations of the issues in the 1970s.
The [[Lesbian Sex Mafia]] founded by [[Dorothy Allison]] appeared in New York advocating [[sex positive feminism]] and promoting the idea that all women had the right to explore their sexuality in whatever ways they saw fit. The controversial [[1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality]], which brought these issues to the attention of academic feminists, is often regarded as officially launching the feminist sex wars.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth|date=1983-01-01|title=The Context of 'Between Pleasure and Danger': The Barnard Conference on Sexuality|jstor=1394680|journal=Feminist Review|issue=13|pages=35–41|doi=10.2307/1394680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s feminist scholars continued to research and apply different feminist academic [[:wikt:framework|frameworks]] to the questions of sexuality and BDSM in an effort to find a way to bridge the gap between the two groups.  Hopkins, in 1994 applied critical analysis to the feminist viewpoints against Sadomasochistic acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=P.D.|title=Rethinking sadomasochism: Feminism, interpretation and simulation|journal=Hypatia|year=1994|volume=9|issue=1|page=116|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1994.tb00112.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She takes each argument put forth against BDSM practice by women and answers it from within a feminist framework.   In the end, she points out that the issue is not as concrete as feminists may try and paint it and that they may need to examine the concepts in more detail.    In 1995, Teresa Hornsby also applied feminist frameworks to the subject of BDSM and came down on the side that the two were not contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornsby|first=Teresa|title=Gender role reversal and the violated lesbian body: Toward a feminist hermeneutic of lesbian sadomasochism|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|year=1999|volume=3|issue=3|pages=61–72|doi=10.1300/j155v03n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Hornsby went further to examine whether or not violence itself was only a masculine activity.

=== 2000s ===
After 2000, advances in technology were opening up the world to more people and BDSM started coming out more and more in popular culture.  [http://law.uvic.ca/faculty_staff/faculty_directory/deckha.php Maneesha Deckha] applied a [[postcolonial feminist]] approach where she suggests treating BDSM as a cultural practice as a means to put to rest the divide between feminists and BDSM practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain as culture: A postcolonial feminist approach to S/M and women’s agency.|journal=Sexualities|year=2011|volume=14|issue=2|doi=10.1177/1363460711399032}}&lt;/ref&gt; She came to the conclusion as did those in the 90's that perhaps a more in depth look is needed to determine if feminist viewpoints on BDSM hold up under closer scrutiny.     In addition, Deckha did some work on the concepts of consent and the legality of BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain, pleasure, and consenting women: Exploring feminist responses to S/m and its legal regulation in Canada through [[Elfriede Jelinek|Jelinek's]] ''[[The Piano Teacher (Jelinek novel)|The Piano Teacher]]''.|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender|year=2007|volume=30|issue=2|pages=425–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically addressing the question on whether or not women can give consent and whether BDSM activities should be regulated in the context of violence or the context of sexuality.  One point she makes is if legislation is made in the context of regulating it around sex then aren't we simply giving the patriarchy further control over women's expression of sexual identity.

=== Current feminist viewpoints ===
Current feminist viewpoints on BDSM practices continue to be controversial and at odds with one another. Some feminists view SM as an ideal feminist expression of sexual freedom while other feminists say that BDSM, and more particularly SM, reinforce patriarchy and that these practices are contradictory to feminism. Feminists who view BDSM as contradictory to feminism also often believe that women who engage in BDSM practices, and specifically those who play a submissive role in them, have been led by sexist power structures to believe that they enjoy these acts. This feminist viewpoint argues that the individuals who enjoy playing a submissive role in the bedroom only enjoy it because they have been led to believe that it is what is expected of them and that they should enjoy it. This viewpoint argues that if these individuals, particularly women, were able to explore their sexual desires without the influence of a sexist power structure that they would come to very different conclusions about what they enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain as a Culture: A Postcolonial Feminist Approach to S/M and Women's Agency|journal=Sexualities|year=2011|volume=14|issue=129|doi=10.1177/1363460711399032}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perspectives on lesbian BDSM ===
Lesbian SM (Sadism, Submission, Masochism) has been problematic in the analysis of feminist viewpoints on BDSM, especially with regards to whether or not lesbians are recreating patriarchal structures.    Many academic critics do not even tackle the idea of lesbian BDSM. Maneesha Deckha in her article, "Pain, pleasure, and consenting women: Exploring feminist responses to S/M and its legal regulation in Canada through [[Elfriede Jelinek|Jelinek's]] ''[[The Piano Teacher (Jelinek novel)|The Piano Teacher]]'' admitted that covering lesbian BDSM made her theories too convoluted to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=M.|title=Pain, pleasure, and consenting women: Exploring feminist responses to S/m and its legal regulation in Canada through Jelinek's the piano teacher|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender|year=2007|volume=30|series=2|pages=425–459|accessdate=5 February 2012|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/jlg/vol302/425-460_Deckha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such lesbian erasure has been fairly common in second and third wave feminism as lesbian identity has frequently been subsumed in feminist identity. This concept is explained by Calhoun in "The Gender Closet: Lesbian disappearance under the sign 'woman'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Calhoun|first=C|title=gender closet: Lesbian disappearance under the sign `women'|journal=Feminist Studies|year=1995|volume=21|series=1|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some, such as Deckha, believe  that although lesbians do practice BDSM, they are doing so in an effort to merely recreate the patriarchal power structure in the rest of society. Be it through domination and submission exchange of power, or the butch/femme dynamic, lesbians who interact in this way are convincing themselves that they are outside of patriarchy, when in reality they are reinforcing it because their sexuality is trapped within the patriarchal structure, true consent cannot occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deckha|first=Maneesha|title=Pain as culture: A postcolonial feminist approach to S/M and women’s agency|journal=Sexualities|year=2011|volume=14|series=2|pages=129–150|doi=10.1177/1363460711399032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, such as Hornsby, believe that lesbians can in fact practice BDSM without recreating patriarchal systems because they have already declared themselves to be outside of those systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hornsby|first=Teresa|title=Gender role reversal and the violated lesbian body: Toward a feminist hermeneutic of lesbian sadomasochism|journal=Journal of Lesbian Studies|year=1999|volume=3|series=3|pages=61–72|doi=10.1300/j155v03n03_06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BDSM practitioners ===
Feminist writer Clarisse Thorn released a book in 2012 called ''The S&amp;M Feminist,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clarisse Thorn |title=The S&amp;M Feminist | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6D_AMgEACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9781477472040&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4b4fU8bNLYP7kAWYyoDoDA&amp;redir_esc=y | publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2012 | ISBN=978-1477472040}} (Essays on BDSM, gender and culture)&lt;/ref&gt; in which she often discusses her own experiences. The high-profile feminist anthology ''[[Yes Means Yes]],'' published in 2008, also featured an essay about BDSM and feminism by Stacey May Fowles.

Jessica Wakeman wrote of her own experience with SM activities in a follow-up interview after her article [http://www.thefrisky.com/2009-06-01/first-time-for-everything-spanking/ First Time For Everything: Getting Spanked] was published in 2009. At the time of the interview in October, 2010, Wakeman had been writing about feminist issues, including feminism and media criticism, feminism and politics, and feminism and sex for about eight years and considered herself to be a rather active feminist.&lt;ref name =carpm&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpentier|first=Megan|title=BDSM And Feminism: "Stop Telling Me What I’m Supposed To Like, D*mn It."|url=http://jezebel.com/5666107/bdsm-and-feminism-%20stop-telling-me-what-im-supposed-to-like-dmn-it|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wakeman discussed how she is able to enjoy spanking play and being dominated and still be a feminist. She discussed how spanking play is a fetish and is no different from other fetishes that individuals have, even though it does involve being hit by one's partner. She also commented that it is important to remember that when an individual is involved with BDSM play, such as spanking, if it is true BDSM play it has been discussed by both partners and either of them can stop the play at any time with a safe word. Furthermore, a real physically or emotionally abusive relationship is not safe and consensual like BDSM play is. There is a difference between what happens in the bedroom and what happens in real life. Wakeman wrote that she is able to enjoy things in the context of sex or flirting that she wouldn't want to happen in her day-to-day life.&lt;ref name =carpm/&gt;

Like other feminist BDSM practitioners, Wakeman rejects the argument that women are taught what they enjoy and led to be submissive by a dominant sexist power structure. Within BDSM communities, it is often said that submissive practitioners are the real dominants because they have the ultimate control over the situation with a safe word.&lt;ref name =carpm/&gt;

'''Foreshadowing''' is a [[Literary technique|literary device]] in which a writer gives an advance hint of what is to come later in the story. Foreshadowing often appears at the beginning of a story, or a chapter, and it helps the reader develop expectations about the upcoming events. 

A writer may implement foreshadowing in many different ways.  Some of these ways include: character dialogues, plot events, and changes in setting. Even the title of a work or a chapter can act as a clue that suggests what is going to happen. Foreshadowing in fiction creates an atmosphere of suspense in a story, so that the readers are interested and want to know more.

This literary device is generally used to build anticipation in the minds of readers about what might happen next, thus adding dramatic tension to a story.  Moreover, foreshadowing can make extraordinary and bizarre events appear credible, as the events are predicted beforehand so that readers are mentally prepared for them. &lt;ref name=devices&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreshadowing|url=https://literarydevices.net/foreshadowing/|website=Literarydevices.net|accessdate=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This literary device is frequently adapted for use by [[composer]]s of theatrical music, in the composition of [[opera]]s, [[musicals]], [[radio]], film, [[television]], [[Video game|gaming]], podcast, and internet scores and [[underscoring|underscores]], and [[incidental music]] for spoken theatrical productions.

==Misconceptions==
Foreshadowing is often confused with other [[literary techniques]]. Some of these techniques include:
* A "[[red herring (plot device)|red herring]]", is a hint that is designed to mislead the audience. However, foreshadowing only hints at a possible outcome within the confinement of a narrative, and purposely leads readers in the right direction. 
* A "[[flashforward]]" is a scene that takes the [[narrative]] forward in time from the current point of the story in [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], and other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ulrike Spierling|author2=Nicolas Szilas|title=Interactive Storytelling: First Joint International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling, ICIDS 2008 Erfurt, Germany, November 26-29, 2008, Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIkhA9zuvSUC&amp;pg=PA156|date=3 December 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-89424-7|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/flash-forward flash-forward - definition of flash-forward by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Foreshadowing is sometimes employed  through characters' explicitly predicting the future.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 146, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By analogy to foreshadowing, the literary critic Gary Morson describes its opposite, '''sideshadowing'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morson|first1=Gary Saul|title=Sideshadowing and Tempics|journal=New Literary History|date=Autumn 1998|volume=29|issue=4|pages=599–624|jstor=20057502}}&lt;/ref&gt; Found notably in the epic novels of [[Leo Tolstoy]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], it is the practice of including scenes that turn out to have no relevance to the plot. This, according to Morson, increases the verisimilitude of the fiction because the audience knows that in real life, unlike in novels, most events are in fact inconsequential. This "sense of structurelessness" invites the audience to "interpret and question the events that actually do come to pass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Calixto|first1=Joshua|title=LET’S TALK ABOUT ROSA VAR ATTRE, THE IMPOSSIBLE ROMANCE OF THE WITCHER 3|url=http://killscreendaily.com/articles/lets-talk-about-rosa-var-attre-impossible-romance-witcher-3/|accessdate=3 August 2015|work=[[Kill Screen]]|date=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Fountain Archive''''' (also called '''''The Fountain Archives''''' or '''''Fountain Archive Project''''') is a [[wiktionary:processual|processual]] art project of the French conceptual artist [[Saâdane Afif]] which started in 2008/ 2009. The project includes an ongoing series of framed pages which contain one or several reproductions of the work ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]]. Here Afif uses the concept of the [[Found object|Objet trouvés]] (found object) and tears off the pages from different publications. For each publication and pages Afif normally makes only one piece for the ''Fountain Archives'', which is created as a work of art. 

The ''Fountain Archive'' also includes a bookshelf which stores all used publications of the project.

==Origin and description==
[[File:Marcel Duchamp, 1917, Fountain, photograph by Alfred Stieglitz.jpg|thumb|''Fountain'', 1917, signed "R. Mutt"]]
In 2008 Saâdane Afif started to collect publications which contain reproductions of the work ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917) by [[Marcel Duchamp]]. After he was distinguished with the Marcel Duchamp Prize in 2009, Afif began the ''Fountain Archive''. At present the ''Fountain Archive'' contains over 600 images&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefountainarchives.net/current-bibliography/ |title=Current bibliography |publisher=The Fountain Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Duchamp’s porcelain urinal. In this work, Afif collects and archives every publication in which he finds a reproduction of Duchamp's urinal. As a “found object” every page containing the picture of the ''Fountain'' is torn out and then carefully framed. The frame (sometimes with a colored background), used for its preservation and highlight ornament purposes, is also part of the making process. Every step of the archiving follows meticulous rules which participate entirely in the making process of these works of art. For each publication and page Afif normally makes only one piece for the ''Fountain Archive''.&lt;ref name="schriftenreihe57"&gt;Valentina Vlasic: Saâdane Afif, in: The Present Order is the Disorder of the Future, Schriftenreihe Museum Kurhaus Kleve – Ewald Mataré-Sammlung Nr. 62, Freundeskreis Museum Kurhaus und Koekkoek-Haus Kleve e.V. (Hrsg), 2013, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a publication contains images of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' on several pages, all of them are torn off and form together a polyptych. When found, the publications are registered with an archive number ranging from FA 0001 potentially to infinite. Afif intended to continue the Series of Archives until its 1001st. The publications (sans ''Fountain'') are then stored in a bookshelf in the studio of the artist. The bookshelf creates an archive around Duchamp’s ''Fountain'', from which the common initiator has been removed: “an archive without its object“. The ''Fountain Archives'' has been presented in various exhibitions throughout the world.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefountainarchives.net/about/ |title=About |publisher=The Fountain Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, some publications presenting this project by Afif happened to reproduce the work ''Fountain'' of Duchamp. Those specific documents are also incorporated in the ''Fountain Archives'' project. But they are treated as special objects as they are doubled in order to testify of a historical echo, mark a [[mise en abyme]]. In case of the mise en abyme – a publication includes an image of Afif's ''Fountain Archive'' project – there is also one exception to the strict rule that each publication produced only a unique, singular work of the ''Fountain Archive''.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Filipovic, Xavier Hufkens: Sâadane Afif. Fontaines. Triangle Books, 2014, {{ISBN|978-2-930777-05-4}}, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; These pages underline an evolution in the development and perception of the ''Fountain Archives'' as an artwork. They are stored under a specific section titled “Augmented”, and they are building a step-by-step archive within the archive. Therefore, two copies of the publications (sans ''Fountain'') enter the archive bookshelf and two editions of the work are made.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

==History==
In 2013 a group of 101 ''Fountain Archives'' were shown in the exhibition “The Present Order is the Disorder of the Future” based in the Museum Kurhaus Kleve. Referring to the presentation a first text, by the art historic Valentina Vlasic, about the ''Fountain Archive'' was published in the exhibition catalogue. This catalogue contribution included a picture of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'', therefore Afif tears the page off and makes an augmented fountain archive out of it. This said Klever Fountain, with the description FA 0366,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefountainarchives.net/fountain-archives/fa-0366/ |title=FA 0366 |publisher=The Fountain Archives |date= |accessdate=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based in the collection of the Museum Kurhaus Kleve as a permanent loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrz.de/staedte/kleve-und-umland/das-pissoir-im-archiv-der-bilder-id9479188.html|title=Das Pissoir im Archiv der Bilder|last=Gronewald|first=Claudia|access-date=2017-11-26|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
The German art historian Eva Huttenlauch named Marcel Duchamp as Afif’s guiding star, he looked up as his ideal self. Many of Afif’s concepts, like the ''Fountain Archive'', rest on the foundations Duchamp laid.&lt;ref&gt;Eva Huttenlauch: ''Everything must be scandalous'', in: Saâdane Afif. ''Another Anthology of Black Humor'', published by Susanne Gaensheimer and Eva Huttenlauch, Verlag für Moderne Kunst, Nürnberg 2012, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian art historian Valentina Vlasic termed Afif’s ''Fountain Archive'' as a repetition of the key-moment of the ready-made, the fundamental act of selecting which just as it did at that time for Duchamp, represents a complete artistic achievement. Afif does not do this with real objects, like a normal commercial one, but he uses the artistic object of the ''Fountain'' as an illustration from publications. As a charming witticism, Vlasic predicated that there is in addition the fact that Afif leads Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' in a new way back into the museum, a site it had to leave about one hundred years ago through being excluded from the exhibition.&lt;ref name="schriftenreihe57"/&gt;
    
For the art historian Elena Filipovic, the high importance of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' in art history accrued especially because of the reason that the artist understood very well that the reproduction, display, framing, dissemination, and reception of an artwork not only constructs its value and meaning, but also help determine how and if it enters history at all. These comprehension stands also for the background of Saâdane Afifs project of the ''Fountain Archives''.  After “R.Mutt“ or Marcel Duchamp Fillipovic sees in Afif another person which adopts the white urinal and also conducts the construction of an icon. The ''Fountain Archives'', which contain an image of a ''Fountain Archive'' (mise en abyme), are termed as a “remake” by Filipovic. She compares especially these works with the process of signification of Duchamp’s ''Fountain'' in art history.&lt;ref&gt;Elena Filipovic, Xavier Hufkens: Sâadane Afif. Fontaines.

[[File:Henry Neville..jpg|thumb|right|Henry Neville]]
'''Thomas Henry Gartside Neville''' (20 June 1837 – 19 June 1910) was an English actor, dramatist, teacher and [[Actor-manager|theatre manager]]. He began his career playing dashing juvenile leads, later specialising in Shakespearean roles, modern comedy and melodrama.  His most famous role was as Bob Brierley in [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''[[The Ticket-of-Leave Man (play)|The Ticket-of-Leave Man]]''.  As the manager of the [[Olympic Theatre]] from 1873 to 1879, he presented numerous successful productions.  In later years, he became a respected character actor.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Neville was born in [[Manchester]], England, son of John Garside Neville and his second wife Mary Anna, ''née'' Gartside (died 1895).&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U189379 "Neville, Thomas Henry Gartside (Henry Neville)",] ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008, online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was the twentieth child of his father, an actor and the manager of Queen's Theatre, Spring Gardens, Manchester, who himself was the twentieth child of ''his'' father.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'', obituary notice, 21 June 1910, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Though Neville senior was in the theatre, there were strong military traditions on both sides of the family, and John Neville was opposed to his son's decision to pursue a theatrical rather than a military career and refused to help him.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Lawrence, W. J. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35204  "Neville, (Thomas) Henry Gartside (1837–1910)"], rev. Nilanjana Banerji, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Neville had one brother, George (born c. 1839), one sister, Josaphine (c. 1838–1895), and nineteen half-brothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Barry.

[[file:No Thoroughfare by Dickens and Wilkie Collins.jpg|thumb|left|270px|''[[No Thoroughfare]]'' (1868) by [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Wilkie Collins]]. Neville is third from left.]]
From 1857 to 1860 Neville acted in the English provinces and Scotland. When the tragedian John Vandenhoff made his farewell performance in 1858 at the Theatre Royal, [[Liverpool]], Neville played Cromwell to Vandenhoff's Wolsey in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry VIII (play)|King Henry VIII]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He made his London debut in 1860 as Percy Ardent in [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''The Irish Heiress'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. ''[[The Observer]]'' said of his performance: "Mr Henry Neville, a new importation from Liverpool, was gentlemanly and easy, of good manners and dashing appearance; and he promises to fill a dreary gap in the London theatrical world – the line of ''jeunes premières''."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 14 October 1860, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He attracted further good notices for his next role, in ''The Love Chase'', receiving encouragement from ''The Times'' "as a representative of young men of something like rank and position."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 20 October 1860, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The same year, he played Victor Savignie in ''Arrienne'' at the Lyceum and, at the [[Olympic Theatre]], he played Ivan in ''Serf'' and Valjean in an adaptation of ''[[Les Miserables]]''.&lt;ref name=perfs&gt;Collins, Barry. [http://users.zoominternet.net/~bcollins/preview_198.htm "Thomas Henry Gartside Neville Performances"], Gartside–Neville family website, 2007, accessed 25 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1863, still at the Olympic, Neville created the role of Bob Brierley in [[Tom Taylor]]'s drama about the dismal life of a released convict, ''[[The Ticket-of-Leave Man (play)|The Ticket-of-Leave Man]]'', a character in which he made the success of his career.  He played in its long first run and revivals for a total of about 2000 performances.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1865, he played the title role in Taylor's ''Henry Dunbar'' at the Olympic opposite [[Kate Terry]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 21 November 1877, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1867 was her chosen Romeo to her Juliet in her farewell London performances at the [[Adelphi Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 September 1867, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  1867 had been a busy year for Neville at the Adelphi, where he played Job Arnroyd in ''Lost in London'', Benedick in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', Dunbar again, Farmer Allan in ''Dora'', Richard Watt in ''His First Champagne'', Claude Meinotee in ''Lady of Lyons'', Walter Maidenblush in ''Little Treasure'', Sir Thomas Clifford in ''Hunchback'', and George Vendale in ''[[No Thoroughfare]]'', another notable success.&lt;ref name=perfs/&gt; The next year at the Adelphi, he played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and repeated Robert Brierley.  In 1869, still at the Adelphi, he portrayed the role of Vernon Wainwright in ''Eve''.&lt;ref name=perfs/&gt;  At the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in the same year, he played an important role in [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s early comedy, ''[[An Old Score]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Actor-manager===
[[File:TicketFarrenBarrington.jpg|left|thumb|upright|1875 Revival of ''The Ticket-of-Leave Man'', starring Neville and [[Nellie Farren]]]]
Neville continued building his reputation on the London stage in the 1870s as actor and also as the manager of the Olympic Theatre from 1873 to 1879, where his company included rising actors such as [[Rutland Barrington]], [[Helen Ernstone]], [[Emily Fowler]] and [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~a0fs000/1800/0409.html The Olympic Theatre: Static Information - list of managers], accessed 21 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 July 1877, p. 42; and 4 September 1878, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1870, he played Henry Little in ''Put Yourself in His Place'' at the Adelphi.&lt;ref name=perfs/&gt;  In 1872 he had a great success in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' of which ''The Times'' said, "Mr Henry Neville is the leading actor in the class of characters in which Charles Surface is comprised."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 November 1872, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed, at the Olympic, by ''The School for Intrigue'', in which he played the part of Almaviva.&lt;ref name=perfs/&gt;  Other successes during the 1870s, both as manager and actor, included his portrayal of Lord Clancarty in Taylor's ''Lady Clancarty'', Pierre in [[John Oxenford]]'s ''The Two Orphans'' in 1874, an 1874–75 revival of ''The Ticket-of-Leave Man'', and Franklin Blake in a dramatisation of [[Wilkie Collins]]'s ''[[The Moonstone]]'' in 1877.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  In the same year he produced and starred in a revival of ''Lady Audley's Secret'' by Robert Walters.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 July 1877, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  He also produced [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s plays ''[[The Ne'er-do-Weel]]'' in 1878 and  ''[[Gretchen (play)|Gretchen]]'' in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 March 1879, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LONDON ILLUSTR(1877) p6.137 HENRY NEVILLE.jpg|thumbnail|Henry Neville (1877)]]
In 1878, Neville opened a successful drama school which he managed for many years.&lt;ref&gt;The ODNB gives the date as 1878, but Neville's own entry in ''Who's Who'' gives the year as 1884&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1880s, he had become famous in [[melodrama]] roles, playing the romantic lead.  His Shakespeare roles included Jaques in ''[[As You Like It]]'', produced by Madame Modjeska (1882) and Leonato in ''Much Ado About Nothing''.  In 1888, he played Count Heidegger in ''Handsome Is that Handsome Does'', a comedy by C. J. Ribton Turner at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 June 1888, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  At the Olympic that year, he reprised the role Pierre in ''The Two Orphans'' and appeared in ''Hands Across the Sea'' by Henry Pettitt.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 January 1889, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1890, Neville went to America with [[Augustus Harris]]'s company, appearing for 200 nights as Captain Temple in ''Human Nature'', renamed ''The Soudan'' for its U.S. production. On his return to England he resumed his successful place in the autumn melodramas at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

The last phase of Neville's career was with [[Beerbohm Tree|Herbert Beerbohm Tree's]] company at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], where his roles included Leonato&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 January 1905, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and, in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', John of Gaunt.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 April 1905, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; His last engagement was in Tree's revival of ''The School for Scandal'' in 1909. By this stage in his career, Neville had moved to the role of Sir Oliver Surface, with Robert Loraine in Neville's old role as Sir Oliver's nephew, Charles. ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' found Neville "admirably sonorous" in the part.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 April 1909. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Observer'' wrote: "the weighty Sir Oliver of Mr Henry Neville, so well remembered as the dashing Charles Surface of thirty years ago, is exactly in tune with the quietly humorous Moses of Mr [[Lionel Brough]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 11 April 1909. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Neville wrote six plays, all  melodramas. He also published some short books on the theatre, entitled ''The Stage, its Past and Present, in Relation to Fine Art''; ''Gesture; Her First Appearance''; and ''His First and Last Benefit,''&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

Neville died at [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]], [[Sussex]], one day short of his 73rd birthday, of a heart attack induced by a minor accident and was buried at Christ Church in [[Denshaw]], [[Saddleworth]], [[Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He left four sons, from his marriage to Harriet Jane Waddell (c. 1837–1903).&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Barry. [http://users.zoominternet.net/~bcollins/preview_200.htm "Thomas Henry Gartside &amp; Harriet Jane Neville Family (A)"], Gartside–Neville family website, 2007, accessed 25 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' concluded its obituary notice of Neville: "He had troops of friends, and there are not two opinions as to his reputation for fair dealing with his fellow men. As well as an actor, he was a man of business, with a fund of common sense, fond of sport, and a glutton for outdoor exercise. He was well known as a [[Freemason]] and generally respected by all with whom he was associated, and beloved by those who knew him intimately."&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6821">'''Hera Gallery''' is a small, non-profit [[artist cooperative]] in [[Wakefield, Rhode Island]] USA. Created within the context of the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|feminist art movement]], Hera Gallery was a pioneer in the genesis of [[artist-run space]]s. Its founding objective in 1974 was to provide a venue for [[women artists]], under-represented at the time in commercial galleries. As the cultural climate changed in the 1980s, the gallery broadened its scope to include visual artists of both genders. Concurrently, Hera curated more topical exhibitions with a broadened spectrum of social awareness and activism. To this day, the gallery provides contemporary artists with the opportunity to address cultural, social, and political issues and to  maintain creative control.

==History==
Hera Gallery was created in 1974, the year that the alternative gallery movement burst beyond major cities and into locations as remote as a village in rural southern Rhode Island.&lt;ref name="Broude 1994 112"&gt;{{cite book | last = Broude | first = Norma | authorlink = |author2=[[Mary D. Garrard]] | title = The Power of Feminist Art: The American Movement of the 1970s, History and Impact | publisher = Henry N. Abrams | year = 1994 | location = New York | pages = 112 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8109-3732-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was conceived from a [[consciousness-raising]] group consisting mostly of artists, and often associated with the nearby [[University of Rhode Island]], that started meeting in 1969.&lt;ref name="Yow 1989 1–2,4,6"&gt;{{cite book | last = Yow | first = Valerie R. |author2=[[Natalie Boymel Kampen]]  | title = The History of Hera: A Women's Art Cooperative, 1974-1989 | publisher = Hera Educational Foundation| year = 1989 | location = Rhode Island | pages = 1–2, 4, 6 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-9625352-0-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the common topics to discuss were the difficulties of balancing the domestic responsibilities of being wife and mother with a professional artistic career.&lt;ref name="Pamela H. 1991 51–2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The History of Hera: A Woman's Art Cooperative, 1974-1989|journal=Woman's Art Journal|year=1991|first=Simpson|last=Pamela H. |volume=12|issue=2|pages=51–2|id= |format=|doi=10.2307/1358294|jstor=1358294|publisher=Woman's Art, Inc.|last2=Yow|first2=Valerie Raleigh|last3=Kampen|first3=Natalie Boymel }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2007-12-07--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The women discussed the difficulty in having their work represented in Manhattan galleries, where apparent sexism from gallery owners caused their work to be disregarded.&lt;ref name="Yow 1989 1–2,4,6"/&gt; Hera Gallery was thus created in order to foster a professional community of women artists, in the vein of other recently established women-run artist cooperatives,&lt;ref name="Pamela H. 1991 51–2"/&gt; such as New York City's [[A.I.R. Gallery]]. At the time, a Providence Journal writer commented that  "...a  women's art center named after a bitchy Greek goddess and housed in a barn that used to be a laundry is New England's only art gallery completely owned and controlled by women..." &lt;ref name="Broude 1994 112"/&gt; 
[[Image:Heragalleryexterior.JPG|thumb|right|Photograph of Hera Gallery's exterior]]

==Organizational structure==
Initially the organization of Hera Gallery consisted of non-hierarchical egalitarian committees, influenced by feminist ideals.&lt;ref name="Yow 1989 1–2,4,6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pamela H. 1991 51–2"/&gt; As the gallery grew, its board of directors, once only represented by artist-members, was appended with a community Advisory Board from 1986–2000, according to the gallery's unpublished “Addendum to the History of Hera”. Furthermore, when the Advisory Board was discontinued in 2000, the Board of Directors began including external community members (Addendum). Since 1992 (Addendum) there has also been a Gallery Director part-time paid position.&lt;ref name="membership guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heragallery.org/pdf/heramembershipguidelines.pdf |title=membership guidelines |accessdate=2007-12-07 |date=May 2000 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018191913/http://www.heragallery.org/pdf/heramembershipguidelines.pdf |archivedate=2007-10-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hera Gallery offers its members an annual solo exhibition, inclusion in group exhibitions, curatorial opportunities, and positions on the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="membership guidelines"/&gt; It serves the surrounding community by “encouraging ethnic and cultural diversity in both audience and program development.&lt;ref name="membership guidelines"/&gt; ”

==Developments==
Since its inception, Hera Gallery has resided in a building that was a garage in the 1920s, then a laundromat, and later a flea market, before finally being outfitted by the founding artists and their loved ones. Its landlord throughout this time was a sympathetic URI professor who kept the rent low for them.&lt;ref name="Yow 1989 1–2,4,6"/&gt; After his recent demise, the family put the land on the market but waited for a buyer whose plan included preserving the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Mark | last=Schieldrop | title=Mixed use explored for Hera’s, Phil’s | date=2006-09-22 | publisher= | url =http://scindependent.com/articles/2006/09/22/local/astory.txt | work =The South County Independent | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-07 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2007 it was announced that a buyer plans on demolishing the existing building to create a [[mixed-use development]] including residential condominiums and inclusion of the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Katie | last=Mulvaney | title=Condos slated to replace gallery, diner | date=2007-09-14 | publisher= | url =http://www.projo.com/ri/southkingstown/content/SC_SKHERA_09-14-07_D3746UH.355227d.html | work =The Providence Journal | pages = | accessdate = 2007-12-07 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6425">'''Jean-Michel Frank''' (28 February 1895 – 3 August 1941) was a French [[interior design]]er known for [[Minimalism|minimalist]] interiors decorated with plain-lined but sumptuous furniture made of luxury materials, such as [[shagreen]], [[mica]], and intricate straw [[marquetry]].

==Life and career==
Jean-Michel Frank was born in [[Paris]], a son of Léon Frank, a banker, and his wife and cousin, the former Nanette Frank. He was a first cousin of [[Otto Frank]] and, therefore, a first cousin, once removed, of the diarist [[Anne Frank]]. 

From 1904, he attended the [[Lycée Janson de Sailly]] in Paris. He began law school in 1911, but in 1915, he was hit by the double blow of the deaths of his two elder brothers, Oscar and Georges, on the front lines of [[World War I]] and that of his father who committed suicide. In 1928, he lost his mother who had been in a Swiss asylum for several years. From 1920 to 1925 he traveled and visited the world. In Venice he met the cosmopolitan society that gathered around [[Stravinsky]] and [[Diaghilev]]. Around 1927, [[Eugenia Errázuriz]] revealed to him the beauty of 18th century styles and her own modern, minimalist esthetic, and he became her disciple. 

He then got in contact with a Parisian decorator called [[Adolphe Chanaux]] to do his apartment in the Rue de Verneuil. During the 1930s he worked with students at the Paris Atelier, now known as [[Parsons Paris School of Art and Design]], where he developed the famous [[Parsons Table]]. In 1932, with Chanaux, he opened a shop at #140 [[Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré]]. This was to be the consecration of ten years of collaboration, when he decorated for the Rockefellers and Guerlains. He designed [[Nelson Rockefeller]]'s lavish [[Fifth Avenue]] apartment in New York in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=A Rockefeller Fixer-Upper |author=Rozhon, Tracie |newspaper=The New York Times |date=14 October 1999 |location= |page= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/14/garden/turf-a-rockefeller-fixer-upper.html |accessdate=26 May 2011 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter of 1939-40, he left France for Argentina.

In [[Argentina]], Jean-Michel Frank worked with his old friend and business associate Ignacio Pirovano on several important private and commercial projects.&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Beccacece: ''La Nación''. ''Suplemento Cultura'', http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=625203, August 8th 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Michel Frank kept his private apartment in Buenos Aires on the top floor of the company of which he was the Artistic Director&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Emmanuel Martin-Viver: ''JEAN-MICHEL FRANK'', ''The Strange and Subtle Luxury of the Parisian Haute-Monde in the Art Deco Period''; pages 74, 257 and 258.&lt;/ref&gt; in Argentina, [[COMTE]]. This building was located on the corner of Florida Street and Marcelo T. De Alvear Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Harrison Perera: ''The emergence of the importance of Jean-Michel Frank's work with Comte in Argentina'' - http://www.harrison20.com/magazine/articles/comte; page 2.&lt;/ref&gt; He also visited many of his clients in Buenos Aires including the Born family&lt;ref&gt;Hugo Beccacece: ''La Nación''. ''Suplemento Cultura'', http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=625203, August 8th 2004&lt;/ref&gt; whose mansion in the northern suburbs of Buenos Aires remains his single most important project. The entire collection is still intact and in-place in precisely the manner that Jean-Michel Frank conceived it. Recently published books shed more light on Frank's work with Comte in Argentina.

In 1941, Frank made a trip to [[New York City]]. Sadly overcome by depression he committed suicide by throwing himself from the window of a Manhattan apartment building, leaving all his personal possessions in his apartment in Buenos Aires.

A unique collection of home furniture designed by Frank for [[Hermès]] in 1924 is considered a classic set of minimalist homeware. The iconic designs – including a sheepskin club chair and parchment-covered dressing table – hold an enduring popularity, and Hermès rereleased many of the items to great fanfare in early 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= |first1= |date=May 2011 |title=Being Frank  |journal=[[W Magazine]] |publisher=Condé Nast |volume= |issue=|page=78 |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Michel Frank today is recognized by leading designers the world over as one of the greatest sources of inspiration to many present-day designs.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times blog, 20 de octubre de 2010: http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/now-showing-jean-michel-frank-in-argentina/&lt;/ref&gt; His pieces are highly sought after by leading collectors worldwide. Many of the premier auction houses offer his pieces and prices are often in excess of 200,000 EUR.&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby's, 24 de noviembre de 2010, lote 8: http://www.sothebys.com/es/catalogues/ecatalogue.html/2010/20th-century-decorative-arts-design-pf1025#/r=/es/ecat.fhtml.PF1025.html+r.m=/es/ecat.lot.PF1025.html/8/&lt;/ref&gt; An important exhibition was mounted towards the end of 2010 at a leading gallery in New York's SoHo. This exhibition highlighted Frank's work with Comte in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times blog, 20 de octubre de 2010: http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/20/now-showing-jean-michel-frank-in-argentina/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="911">The '''Karlskoga Nobel Art Scholarship''' is an annual [[scholarship]] given to artists in memory of the Swedish inventor [[Alfred Nobel]].  In 1996 a [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist by the name of Göran Persson created a portfolio of graphics describing Nobel's life in [[Karlskoga]], Sweden. Proceeds from the sales of the portfolio were used as the initial fund for the scholarship.

A project of the [[Karlskoga Municipality]], the scholarship is open to all active Swedish artists with preference given to those working in [[graphics]]. Founded in 1996, the first Karlskoga Nobel Art Scholarship award was given on December 10 of the same year. Recipients of the scholarship have their works selected by a jury.

The book was released on September 27, 2011.

O'Reilly indicated in a ''USA Today'' interview that his coauthor Martin Dugard has written several history books.&lt;ref name="USAToday-Dec1-11" /&gt; O'Reilly himself graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from [[Marist College]] in 1971 as well as advanced degrees from [[Boston University]] and [[Harvard University]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late October 2011, the publisher, Henry Holt and Co., stated that ''Killing Lincoln'' had sold nearly a million copies.&lt;ref name="SalonNov11-11" /&gt; On the November 14, 2011 edition of ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', O'Reilly told his television audience that "there are now more than 1 million copies of ''Killing Lincoln'' in print, and the book continues to sell briskly."&lt;ref name="PoliticoNov14-11" /&gt; By December 2012, the New York Times reported the book had been on their best-seller list for more than 65 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/24/books/bill-oreilly-has-top-2-spots-on-hardcover-best-seller-list.html?_r=0| newspaper=New York Times| title=Bill O'Reilly has Top 2 Spots on Hardcover Best-Seller List| accessdate=1 Jan 2014| first=Leslie| last=Kaufman| date=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
During the book's initial release, Rae Emerson, the deputy superintendent of [[Ford's Theatre National Historic Site]], conducted a review of the book's text and discovered a number of inaccuracies, which she described as "factual errors" and listed as numbering ten, each different and one additionally occurring multiple times.&lt;ref name="SalonNov11-11"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the review, the [[National Park Service]], which manages Ford's Theatre, made the decision not to allow the edition of the book containing the errors to be sold at the Eastern National Bookstore located in the Museum at Ford’s Theatre National Historic Site, although it is sold in a gift shop in the lobby that is operated independently by the Ford’s Theatre Society.&lt;ref name="WashPostNov12-11"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Edward Steers, Jr.|Edward Steers]] has also criticized the book in a review for various inaccuracies and for lending support to conspiracy theories.

In response to Emerson's review, O'Reilly said that the mistakes, which he numbered less than her findings at just "four minor misstatements" and "two typeset errors" and had been corrected in subsequent printings.&lt;ref name="WashPostNov14-11"&gt;

The following is a list of songs that the [[BBC]] (the British Broadcasting Corporation) has, at one stage or another, considered unsuitable for [[broadcasting]] on its [[radio]] and [[television]] stations. Although the BBC has historically banned songs it deemed unsuitable, in recent years the Corporation has claimed that it no longer bans any records. As the United Kingdom's public service broadcasting corporation, the BBC has always felt some obligation to standards of taste and decency, to varying levels, at different times in its history. This "we know best" attitude has earned it the nickname of "Auntie BBC" or "Auntie Beeb".

The BBC has banned songs from the following artists; [[Cliff Richard]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Noël Coward]], [[the Beatles]], [[Ken Dodd]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Bing Crosby]], the [[BBC Dance Orchestra]], [[Tom Lehrer]], [[Glenn Miller]], and [[George Formby]]. In addition, 67 songs were banned from BBC airplay as the first [[Gulf War]] began, including [[ABBA]]'s "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]", [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] "[[Killer Queen]]" and [[the Boomtown Rats]]' "[[I Don't Like Mondays]]".

==History==
Files at the BBC's Written Archives Centre in [[Caversham, Berkshire]] now available for public inspection show that the [[Dance Music Policy Committee]], set up in the 1930s, took the role of Britain's cultural guardian seriously: one 1942 directive read:
{{"|We have recently adopted a policy of excluding sickly sentimentality which, particularly when sung by certain vocalists, can become nauseating and not at all in keeping with what we feel to be the need of the public in this country in the fourth year of war.&lt;ref name="The music the BBC banned"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article4465603.ece | title=The music the BBC banned | work=[[The Times]] | location=London | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=29 May 2013 | last=Stanley | first=Bob | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616140644/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article4465603.ece | archivedate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The BBC's director of music, Sir [[Arthur Bliss]], wrote wartime instructions for the committee banning songs "which are slushy in sentiment" or "pop" versions of classical pieces such as "[[I'm Always Chasing Rainbows]]", from the 1918 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show ''Oh, Look!'', which made use of [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s ''[[Fantaisie-Impromptu]]''. Other songs based on Classical music themes that were later banned by the committee for "distortion of melody, harmony and rhythm" were [[the Cougars]]' 1963 single "Saturday Nite at the Duck-Pond", which used music from ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and "[[Baubles, Bangles and Beads]]", from the 1953 [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'', which was based on the second movement of [[Alexander Borodin]]'s ''[[String Quartet No. 2 (Borodin)|String Quartet in D]]''.&lt;ref name="Unfit for aunties"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/unfit-for-aunties-airwaves-the-artists-censored-by-the-bbc-765106.html | title=Unfit for Auntie's airwaves: The artists censored by the BBC | work=[[The Independent]] | location=London | date=14 December 2007 | accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other justifications for such bans have included the use of [[foul language]] in lyrics, explicit [[sexual content]], supposed [[drug]] references, and controversial political subject matter.&lt;ref name="Unfit for aunties" /&gt; The implementation of a strict ban on advertising led to the banning of [[the Kinks]]' 1970 song "[[Lola (song)|Lola]]",&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/radio-industry/news/article.cfm?c_id=295&amp;objectid=10483279 | title=Banning songs not a rare occurrence for the BBC | work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | location=Auckland | date=19 December 2007 | accessdate=15 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Don Cornell]]'s 1954 song "[[Hold My Hand (1953 song)|Hold My Hand]]" was banned from airplay due to religious references.&lt;ref name="Unfit for aunties" /&gt; The work of artist [[Ewan MacColl]] was banned by the BBC owing to his sympathies with [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/radical-ewan-maccoll-was-tracked-by-mi5-for-decades-468689.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707114822/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/radical-ewan-maccoll-was-tracked-by-mi5-for-decades-468689.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2008 |title='Radical' Ewan MacColl was tracked by MI5 for decades |work=The Independent |location=London |last=Goodchild |first=Sophie |date=5 March 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satire]] was another reason for banning: in 1953, ten of the twelve tracks on humorist [[Tom Lehrer]]'s album ''[[Songs by Tom Lehrer]]'' were banned.&lt;ref name="Unfit for aunties" /&gt; In February 1956, the British music magazine ''[[NME]]'' reported that the theme for the [[film]] ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'', recorded by [[Eddie Calvert]], was also banned.&lt;ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years"&gt;{{cite book | title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years | publisher=[[Reed Elsevier|Reed International Books Ltd]] | year=1992 | edition=1st | last=Tobler | first=John | page=23 | isbn=978-0-600-57602-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite it being an [[instrumental]], a BBC spokesman reported: "The ban is due to its connection with a film about drugs." – [[Billy May]]'s version, retitled "Main Theme", was approved for transmission.&lt;ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years" /&gt;

In certain cases, appeals to the BBC in favour of banning a song have failed or have only been partial. In 1972, Christian morality campaigner [[Mary Whitehouse]] failed in her campaign for the BBC to stop playing [[Chuck Berry]]'s "[[My Ding-a-Ling]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/26/ban-this-filth-ben-thompson-review | title=Ban This Filth!: Letters from the Mary Whitehouse Archive by Ben Thompson – review | work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | date=26 October 2012 | accessdate=29 May 2013 | last=Jeffries | first=Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldpress.org/europe/0202whitehouse.htm | title=Morals Campaigner Mary Whitehouse | work=[[World Press Review]] | location=New York |date=February 2002 | accessdate=13 May 2012 | last=Coleman | first=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a few months earlier in that year had persuaded the corporation to prevent [[Alice Cooper]]'s "[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]" from being featured on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017pn6z | title=Rock 'n' Roll legend Alice Cooper in conversation with Mark Lawson | publisher=[[BBC Four]] | date=21 November 2011 | accessdate=29 May 2013 | last=Lawson | first=Mark | authorlink=Mark Lawson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/ban-this-filth-letters-from-the-mary-whitehouse-archive-edited-by-ben-thompson-8297791.html | title=Ban This Filth!

In January 1984, [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]]'s [[Mike Read]] refused to play [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]]'s "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]" on his mid-morning show, declaring it "overtly obscene",&lt;ref name="Frankie"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/959284.stm | title='Banned' Frankie tops chart | publisher=BBC News | date=6 October 2000 | accessdate=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; a decision which the BBC then followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3395823.stm | title=Banned on the run | publisher=BBC News | date=14 January 2004 | accessdate=8 May 2010 | last=Duffy | first=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC has claimed in recent years that it no longer bans any records,&lt;ref name="Leaders of the banned"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/apr/12/artsfeatures.popandrock | title=Leaders of the banned | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=12 April 2002 | accessdate=16 December 2008 | last=Petridis | first=Alexis}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the controversy over [[the Prodigy]]'s "[[Smack My Bitch Up]]" in 1997.&lt;ref name="The less than shocking classics the BBC banned"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-502751/Revealed-The-shocking-classics-BBC-banned.html | title=The less than shocking classics the BBC banned | work=[[Daily Mail]] | location=London | date=17 December 2007 | accessdate=29 May 2013 | last=Revoir | first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, cases of direct or indirect censorship have happened; according to a BBC spokesperson, no official ban was imposed in the case of [[Linda McCartney]]'s posthumous "The Light Comes from Within" despite her widower [[Paul McCartney]] running advertisements in the national press criticising a supposed ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/262450.stm | title=Linda's last song 'banned' | publisher=BBC News | date=25 January 1999 | accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the bans on some songs have been lifted, other songs have never been officially cleared for airing on BBC radio, and their status is uncertain – in some cases, records which had been banned have since been played on BBC radio without any official announcement that the ban has ended, such as [[the Beatles]]' "[[A Day in the Life]]".&lt;ref name="BBC – Radio 2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/adayinthelife.shtml | title=Sold on Song – Top 100 – 'A Day in the Life' | publisher=[[BBC Radio 2]] | accessdate=12 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Radio One]] banned the full version of [[the Pogues]]' "[[Fairytale of New York]]" in 2007, replacing it with an edited version; however, the ban was quickly lifted due to public outcry.&lt;ref name="Slade's festive hit banned from hotel"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/3688608/Slades-festive-hit-banned-from-hotel.html | title=Slade's festive hit banned from hotel | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | location=London | date=9 December 2008 | accessdate=17 December 2008 | last=Irvine | first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censored vs. banned==
In some cases, it was considered sufficient to censor certain words rather than banning a song outright. In the case of the Kinks' "Lola", once the offending word had been changed – the brand name "[[Coca-Cola]]" to "cherry cola" – the song was given airplay.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt; In other cases, it was not necessary for the BBC to formally ban a particular song, since both parties were well aware of what would be acceptable or not, as was the case of [[George Formby]]'s 1937 song, "With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock".&lt;ref name="Formby"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1572792/George-Formby-lyrics-censored-by-the-BBC.html | title=George Formby lyrics censored by the BBC | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=17 December 2007 | accessdate=16 December 2008 | last=Gammell | first=Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "restricted" list included [[Barry McGuire]]'s 1965 hit, "[[Eve of Destruction (song)|Eve of Destruction]]".&lt;ref name="Unfit for aunties" /&gt;

After the death of former British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] on 8 April 2013, anti-Thatcher sentiment prompted campaigns on social media networks which resulted in the song "[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]" reaching number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/ding-dong%20the%20witch%20is%20dead/|title=Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead chart listing|last=|first=|website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]]|publisher=The Official UK Charts Company|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 April, Radio 1 controller [[Ben Cooper (media executive)|Ben Cooper]] said that the station's [[The Official Chart|chart show]] would not play the song in the usual format, but that a short snippet would be aired as part of a news item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21241791 | title=R1 Chart show will not play full Margaret Thatcher song | publisher=BBC News | date=12 April 2013 | accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of banned songs==
This article lists songs which have been banned by the BBC over the years. Some were banned for only a limited period, and have since received BBC airplay. Others were banned many years after having been first aired, as was the case of [[the Cure]]'s "[[Killing an Arab]]" and [[#Gulf War blacklist|sixty-seven other songs]] which were banned from BBC airplay as the first [[Gulf War]] began.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt;

==Gulf War blacklist==
As the first [[Gulf War]] began, the BBC deemed several songs inappropriate for airplay in light of the situation and subsequently banned them from their radio stations for the duration of the war.&lt;ref name="Sociology"/&gt; A list of sixty-seven banned songs was published by ''[[New Statesman]] and Society'' in conjunction with British public-service television broadcaster [[Channel 4]].&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt; [[The Cure]]'s "[[Killing an Arab]]" is absent from the list, but is known to have been banned in connection with the Gulf War.&lt;ref name="New Zealand Herald" /&gt;

{{American and British English differences}}

This page lists '''works with different titles in the United Kingdom and United States'''. Categories of such works include [[edition (book)#Co-edition|co-editions of books]] and foreign releases of films. Unless otherwise noted, [[United Kingdom|UK]] titles are also used in most other countries, with the exception that [[Canada]] generally uses [[United States|US]] titles. [[Australia]] will sometimes utilize a third alternative title, but more often follows UK or US usage, these differences are included where known. Not listed are minor changes due to [[American and British English spelling differences]]; for example, the American film ''[[Rumor Has It...]]'' is titled ''Rumour Has It...'' in the UK, and, atypically, in Canada as well.

Legend:
*An [[asterisk]] (*) indicates which of the two countries the work originated in. If a work originated in a third country, this is covered in the Notes column. 
*[c] indicates cases where Canada follows UK usage.

| The UK title is also used in Australia and Japan. The two editions are not exactly the same, as when the book was first published, the working title was ''Anne of Windy Willows'', but Montgomery's publisher wanted to change it because of its purported similarity to [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s novel ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''. The same publisher also requested some scenes to be cut out for perceived gory or terrifying content, to which Montgomery complied. Montgomery's UK publisher, however, did not see the need for any of these changes, and published the unedited book under the title ''Anne of Windy Willows''.

The '''Nazca Lines''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|æ|z|k|ɑː}} are a group of very large [[Trench|trenches]] in the [[Nazca Plain|Nazca Desert]], in southern [[Peru]]. They were created between 500 [[Common Era|BCE]] and 500 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.go2peru.com/peru_guide/nazca/nazca_lines.htm|title=Nazca Lines|date=2017-02-22|work=Guía Go2peru|access-date=2018-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[Geoglyph|geoglyphs]] are 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) deep, and between 0.4 and 1.1 km (.2  and .7 mi) wide. Their combined length is over 1,300 km (808 mi), and cover an area of about 50 sq km (19 sq mi).

They were made by scraping off&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/archaeology/nasca-lines/|title=The Nasca Lines Are One of Peru's Mysteries|date=2010-11-08|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the top layer of reddish-brown [[iron oxide]]-coated pebbles to reveal a yellow-grey subsoil.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Some of the Nazca lines form shapes that are best seen from the air (~1,500 ft), though they are visible from the surrounding foothills and other high places.&lt;ref name="GardnerCroix1991"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mYPuAAAAMAAJ Gardner's Art Through the Ages: Ancient, medieval, and non-European art]''.

The figures vary in complexity. Hundreds are simple lines and [[geometric shape]]s; more than 70 are [[zoomorphic]] designs of animals such as a hummingbird, spider, fish, llama, jaguar, monkey, lizard, dog and a human. Other shapes include trees and flowers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Scholars differ in interpreting the purpose of the designs, but in general, they ascribe religious significance to them.&lt;ref name="Selin2013"&gt;Helaine Selin.

Because of its isolation and the dry, windless, stable [[Climate of Peru|climate of the plateau]], the lines have mostly been preserved naturally. Extremely rare changes in weather may temporarily alter the general designs. As of 2012, the lines are said to have been deteriorating because of an influx of [[squatters]] inhabiting the lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taj |first=Mitra |date=August 15, 2012 |title=Pigs and squatters threaten Peru's Nazca lines |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/15/us-peru-nazca-squatters-idUSBRE87E0R520120815 |work=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
The high, arid plateau stretches more than {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} between the towns of [[Nazca]] and [[Palpa, Peru|Palpa]] on the ''[[Pampas]] de Jumana'', approximately {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Lima]], roughly matching the main PE-1S [[Pan-American Highway#Ecuador, Peru, Chile, Argentina and Paraguay|Panamericana Sur]]. The main concentration is in a 10 by 4 km (6 mi by 2 mi) rectangle, south of ''San Miguel de la Pascana'' hamlet. In this area, the most notable geoglyphs are visible.

Although some local geoglyphs resemble [[Paracas culture|Paracas motifs]], scholars believe the Nazca Lines were created by the [[Nazca culture]].

In 1994, they were designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==
The first published mention of the Nazca Lines was by [[Pedro Cieza de León]] in his book of 1553, and he mistook them for [[trail blazing|trail markers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w3dUAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PT84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 141 Pedro Cieza de León, ''La Chronica del Peru'' (The chronicle of Peru)], (Antwerp, (Belgium): Martin Nucio, 1554), p. 141. Note: Cieza discussed the Nazca region of Peru and said that ''"y por algunas partes delos arenales se veen señales, paraque atinen el camino que han de lleuar"'' ("and in some parts of the desert are seen signals, so that they [i.e., the Indians] find the path that has to be taken").&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1586, Luis Monzón reported having seen ancient ruins in Peru, including the remains of "roads".&lt;ref&gt;Luis Monzón (1586) "Descripcion de la tierra del repartimiento de los rucanas antamarcas de la corona real, jurisdicion de la ciudad de Guamanga. año de 1586." in:   Marcos Jiménez de la Espada, ed., ''Relaciones geográficas de Indias: Peru'', volume 1 (Madrid, Spain:  Manuel G. Hernandez, 1881), pp. 197–216.  On [https://books.google.com/books?id=35oaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA210#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 210], Munzón notes seeing ancient ruins, including ''"y hay señales de calles"'' ("and there are signs of streets"). Munzón asked elderly Indians about the ruins. They told him that before the Incas, a people whom ''"llamaron ''viracochas''"'' ("they called ''viracochas''") inhabited the area, and ''"A éstos les hacian caminos, que hoy dia son vistos, tan anchos como una calle"'' ("To those [places] they made paths, that are seen today, as wide as a street").&lt;/ref&gt; Although the lines were partially visible from the nearby hills, the first to report them were Peruvian military and civilian pilots. 

In 1927 the Peruvian archaeologist  Toribio Mejía Xesspe spotted them while he was hiking through the foothills. He discussed them at a conference in Lima in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Mejía Xesspe, Toribio (1939) "Acueductos y caminos antiguos de la hoya del Río Grande de Nazca" (Aqueducts and ancient roads of the Rio Grand valley in Nazca), ''Actas y Trabajos Cientificos del 27 Congreso Internacional de Americanistas'' (Proceedings and scientific works of the 27th international congress of American anthropologists), '''1''': 559–569.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Kosok]], an American historian from [[Long Island University]], is credited as the first scholar to study the Nazca Lines at length. In Peru in 1940–41 to study ancient irrigation systems, he flew over the lines and realized one was in the shape of a bird. Another chance observation helped him see how lines converged at the [[winter solstice]] in the Southern Hemisphere. He began to study how the lines might have been created, as well as to try to determine their purpose. He was joined by archeologist Richard P. Schaedel from the United States, and [[Maria Reiche]], a German mathematician and archaeologist from Lima, to help determine the purpose of the Nazca Lines. They proposed one of the earliest reasons for the existence of the figures: to be markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] rose on significant dates. Archaeologists, historians, and mathematicians have all tried to determine the purpose of the lines.

Determining how they were made has been easier than determining why they were made. Scholars have theorized the Nazca people could have used simple tools and surveying equipment to construct the lines. Archaeological surveys have found wooden stakes in the ground at the end of some lines, which supports this theory. One such stake was [[carbon-dated]] and was the basis for establishing the age of the design complex.

Refuting the hypothesis of [[Erich von Däniken]] that the lines had to have been created by "[[ancient astronauts]]", prominent skeptic [[Joe Nickell]] has reproduced the figures using tools and technology available to the Nazca people. ''[[Scientific American]]'' called his work "remarkable in its exactness" when compared to the existing lines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1V-BIdlc9YEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=joe+nickell+nazca+lines&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=nazca&amp;f=false Nickell, Joe (2005). ''Unsolved History: Investigating Mysteries of the Past''], The University Press of Kentucky {{ISBN|978-0-8131-9137-9}}, pp. 13–16&lt;/ref&gt; With careful planning and simple technologies, Nickell proved that a small team of people could recreate even the largest figures within days, without any aerial assistance.&lt;ref name="reece"/&gt;

Most of the lines are formed on the ground by a shallow trench with a depth between {{convert|10|and|15|cm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. Such trenches were made by removing the reddish-brown [[iron oxide]]-coated pebbles that cover the surface of the Nazca Desert. When this gravel is removed, the light-colored clay earth exposed in the bottom of the trench produces lines and contrasts sharply in color and tone with the surrounding land surface. This sublayer contains high amounts of [[Lime (material)|lime]] which, with the morning mist, hardens to form a protective layer that shields the lines from winds, thereby preventing [[erosion]].

The Nazca "drew" several hundred simple, but huge, curvilinear animal and human figures by this technique. In total, the [[earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] project is huge and complex: the area encompassing the lines is nearly {{convert|450|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, and the largest figures can span nearly 370 m (1,200&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt; Some figures have been measured: the hummingbird is {{cvt|93|m|ft}} long, the condor is {{cvt|134|m|ft}}, the monkey is {{cvt|93|by|58|m|ft}}, and the spider is {{cvt|47|m|ft}}. The extremely dry, windless, and constant climate of the Nazca region has preserved the lines well. This desert is one of the driest on Earth and maintains a temperature near {{cvt|25|C|F}} year round. The lack of wind has helped keep the lines uncovered and visible.

The discovery of two new small figures was announced in early 2011 by a Japanese team from [[Yamagata University]]. One of these resembles a human head and is dated to the early period of Nazca culture or earlier, and the other, undated, is an animal. In March 2012, the university announced a new research center would be opened at the site in September 2012 to study the area for the next 15 years. The team has been conducting field work there since 2006, when it had found approximately 100 new [[geoglyph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Team finds more Peru geoglyphs|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20110120a6.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715002321/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20110120a6.html|archivedate=2012-07-15|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=Japan Times|date=Jan 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University to open center at Nazca Lines|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120322b3.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326155532/http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120322b3.html|archivedate=2012-03-26|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=Japan Times|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Earlier Paracas geoglyphs ==

The [[Paracas culture]] is considered the precursor that influenced the development of the Nazca Lines. In 2018, drones used by archaeologists revealed many geoglyphs in the Palpa province that are being assigned to the Paracas culture. Many predate the associated Nazca lines by a thousand years. Some demonstrate a significant difference in the subjects and locations, such as some being on hillsides.&lt;ref&gt;Greshko, Michael, [https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/04/new-nasca-nazca-lines-discovery-peru-archaeology/ Exclusive: "Massive Ancient Drawings Found in Peruvian Desert"], ''National Geographic'', 5 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Their co-discoverer, Peruvian archaeologist Luis Jaime Castillo Butters, indicates that many of these newly discovered geoglyphs represent warriors.

==Purpose==
[[file:Nazca Lines SPOT 1311.jpg|right|thumb|Nazca Lines seen from [[SPOT Satellite]]]]
[[Anthropologist]]s, [[ethnologist]]s, and [[archaeologist]]s have studied the ancient Nazca culture to try to determine the purpose of the lines and figures. One hypothesis is that the Nazca people created them to be seen by deities in the sky. 

[[Paul Kosok]] and [[Maria Reiche]] advanced a purpose related to [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], as has been common in other cultures: the lines were intended to act as a kind of [[observatory]], to point to the places on the distant horizon where the sun and other celestial bodies rose or set in the solstices. Many prehistoric [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] cultures in the Americas and elsewhere constructed earthworks that combined such astronomical sighting with their religious cosmology, as did the late [[Mississippian culture]] at [[Cahokia]] and other sites in present-day United States. Another example is [[Stonehenge]] in England.

[[Gerald Hawkins]] and [[Anthony Aveni]], experts in [[archaeoastronomy]], concluded in 1990 that the evidence was insufficient to support such an astronomical explanation.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8160-2581-9"&gt;{{cite book |author=Cameron, Ian |title=Kingdom of the Sun God: A History of the Andes and Their People |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |date=1990 |page=46 |isbn=0-8160-2581-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maria Reiche asserted that some or all of the figures represented [[constellation]]s. By 1998, Phyllis B. Pitluga, a protégé of Reiche and senior astronomer at the [[Adler Planetarium]] in [[Chicago]], had concluded that the animal figures were "representations of heavenly shapes". According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', "she contends they are not shapes of constellations, but of what might be called ''counter constellations'', the irregularly-shaped dark patches within the twinkling expanse of the [[Milky Way]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/15/world/maria-reiche-95-keeper-of-an-ancient-peruvian-puzzle-dies.html?pagewanted=all ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr, "Maria Reiche, 95, Keeper of an Ancient Peruvian Puzzle, Dies"], ''The New York Times,'' 15 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Aveni criticized her work for failing to account for all the details.

Alberto Rossell Castro (1977) proposed a multi-functional interpretation of the geoglyphs. He classified them into three groups: the first appeared to be tracks connected to irrigation and field division, the second are lines that are axes connected with mounds and cairns, and the third was linked to astronomical interpretations.&lt;ref&gt; Rossel Castro, Albert. (1977) ''Arqueología Sur del Perú'', Lima: Editorial Universo&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, archaeologist [[Johan Reinhard]] published archaeological, [[ethnographic]], and historical data demonstrating that worship of mountains and other water sources predominated in Nazca religion and economy from ancient to recent times. He theorized that the lines and figures were part of religious practices involving the worship of deities associated with the availability of water, which directly related to the success and productivity of crops. He interpreted the lines as sacred paths leading to places where these deities could be worshiped. The figures were symbols representing animals and objects meant to invoke the aid of the deities in supplying water. The precise meanings of many of the individual geoglyphs remain unknown.

[[Henri Stierlin]], a Swiss [[art historian]] specializing in Egypt and the Middle East, published a book in 1983 linking the Nazca Lines to the production of ancient textiles that archeologists have found wrapping [[mummies]] of the [[Paracas culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Stierlin (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; He contended that the people may have used the lines and trapezes as giant, primitive [[loom]]s to fabricate the extremely long strings and wide pieces of textiles typical of the area. According to his theory, the figurative patterns (smaller and less common) were meant only for ritualistic purposes. This theory is not widely accepted, although scholars have noted similarities in patterns between the textiles and the Nazca Lines. They interpret these similarities as arising from the common culture.

The first systematic field study of the geoglyphs was made by Markus Reindel and Johny Cuadrado Island. Since 1996, they have documented and excavated more than 650 sites.  They compared the iconography of the lines to  ceramics of the cultures. As archeologists, they believe that the figurative motifs of geoglyphs can be dated to having been made between 200 and 600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Reindel and Wagner, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the results of geophysical investigations and the observation of geological faults, Johnson argued that some geoglyphs followed the paths of aquifersm from which aqueducts (or ''[[puquios]]'') collected water.&lt;ref&gt; Johnson et al. 2002 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicola Masini]] and [[Giuseppe Orefici]] have conducted research in Pampa de Atarco (at about 10 km south of Pampa de Nasca), which they believe reveals a spatial, functional and religious relationship between these geoglyphs and the temples of [[Cahuachi]].&lt;ref&gt; Masini et al. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, they investigated using  remote sensing techniques and found "five groups of geoglyphs, each of them characterized by a specific motif and shape, and associated with a distinct function".&lt;ref&gt; Masini et al. 2016, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; They identified a ceremonial one, characterized by meandering motifs. Another is related to calendrical purpose, as proved by the presence of radial centers aligned along the directions of winter solstice and equinox sunset.  As have earlier scholars, the two Italians believe that the geoglyphs were the venues of events linked to the agriculture calendar. These also served to strengthen social cohesion among various groups of pilgrims, sharing common ancestors and religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Masini et al. 2016, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative explanations==
[[file:NEO nazca lines big.jpg|right|thumb|Satellite picture of an area containing lines: north is to the right (coordinates: {{coord|14|43|S|75|08|W|}})]]&lt;!-- note image is rotated approx. 90° cw, with north at right --&gt;
Other theories were that the geometric lines could indicate water flow or irrigation schemes, or be a part of rituals to "summon" water. The spiders, birds, and plants may be fertility symbols. It also has been theorized that the lines could act as an [[astronomical calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Cynthia Stokes|title=Big History|publisher=The New Press|location=New York|date=2007|page=167|isbn=978-1-59558-196-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phyllis Pitluga, senior astronomer at the [[Adler Planetarium]] and a protégé of Reiche, performed computer-aided studies of star alignments. She asserted the giant spider figure is an [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic]] diagram of the [[Orion (constellation)|constellation Orion]]. She further suggested that three of the straight lines leading to the figure were used to track the changing [[declinations]] of the three stars of [[Orion's Belt]]. In a critique of her analysis, Dr. Anthony F. Aveni noted she did not account for the other 12 lines of the figure. 

He commented generally on her conclusions, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I really had trouble finding good evidence to back up what she contended. Pitluga never laid out the criteria for selecting the lines she chose to measure, nor did she pay much attention to the archaeological data Clarkson and Silverman had unearthed. Her case did little justice to other information about the coastal cultures, save applying, with subtle contortions, Urton's representations of constellations from the highlands. As historian [[Jacquetta Hawkes]] might ask: was she getting the pampa she desired?&lt;ref&gt;Aveni, Anthony F. ''Between the Lines: The Mystery of the Giant Ground Drawings of Ancient Nasca, Peru ''. Austin, Texas: University of Texas Press. 1 July 2006 {{ISBN|0-292-70496-8}} p.205 [https://books.google.com/books?id=J5mEfUJgno0C&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=pitluga+nazca+lines&amp;ei=zpVES4LGEJ-SygTgp53oBw&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jim Woodmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/scienceinthesand/the-theory-of-jim-woodman|title=The Theory of Jim Woodman - Science in the Sand|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; theorized that the Nazca lines could not have been made without some form of flight to observe the figures properly. Based on his study of available technology, he suggests a [[hot-air balloon]] was the only possible means of flight at the time of construction. To test this hypothesis, Woodmann made a hot-air balloon using materials and techniques he understood to have been available to the Nazca people. The balloon flew, after a fashion. Most scholars have rejected Woodmann's thesis as ''[[ad hoc hypothesis|ad hoc]]'',&lt;ref name="reece"&gt;Katherine Reece, [http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&amp;file=article&amp;sid=96 "Grounding the Nasca Balloon"], ''Into the Hall of Ma'at'' website&lt;/ref&gt; because of the lack of any evidence of such balloons.&lt;ref&gt;Haughton (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation and environmental concerns==
People trying to preserve the Nazca Lines are concerned about threats of [[pollution]] and [[erosion]] caused by [[deforestation]] in the region.

After flooding and mudslides in the area in mid-February 2007, Mario Olaechea Aquije, archaeological resident from Peru's [[National Institute of Culture]], and a team of specialists surveyed the area. He said, "[T]he mudslides and heavy rains did not appear to have caused any significant damage to the Nazca Lines". He noted that the nearby Southern [[Pan-American Highway]] did suffer damage, and "the damage done to the roads should serve as a reminder to just how fragile these figures are."&lt;ref&gt;Living in Peru.

In 2012, squatters occupied land in the area, damaging a Nazca-era cemetery and allowing their pigs to have access to some of the land.

In 2013, machinery used in a limestone quarry was reported to have destroyed a small section of a line, and caused damage to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Manuel Vigo |url=http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-3743-peru-heavy-machinery-destroys-nazca-lines/ |title=Peru: Heavy machinery destroys Nazca lines |publisher=Peru this Week |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729023312/http://www.peruthisweek.com/news-3743-peru-heavy-machinery-destroys-nazca-lines |archivedate=2013-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14125">'''New adult''' ('''NA''') '''fiction''', also rendered as '''new-adult fiction''', is a developing genre of fiction with protagonists in the 18–30 age bracket.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, Sandra L. (2008). Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives. pp. 111, 119–126.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Martin's Press]] first coined the term in 2009, when they held a special call for "...fiction similar to YA that can be published and marketed as adult—a sort of an 'older YA' or 'new adult'".&lt;ref name="GC1"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Martin's New Adult Contest|url=http://sjaejones.com/blog/2009/st-martins-new-adult-contest|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New adult fiction tends to focus on issues such as leaving home, developing sexuality, and negotiating education and career choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Would you read novels aimed at 'new adults'?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/10/new-adult-fiction|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=London|first=Briony|last=Chappell|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre has gained popularity rapidly over the last few years, particularly through books by self-published bestselling authors like Jennifer L. Armentrout, Cora Carmack, [[Colleen Hoover]], and Jamie McGuire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Adult fiction is the hot new category in books|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/04/15/new-adult-genre-is-the-hottest-category-in-book-publishing/2022707/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=19 May 2013|first1=Deirdre|last1=Donahue|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Alexander Interview Part 3|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/karl-alexander-interview-part-3|publisher=FearNet|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre was originally faced criticism, as some viewed it as a marketing scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New Adult' Fiction Is Now an Official Literary Genre Because Marketers Want Us to Buy Things|url=http://jezebel.com/5960942/new-adult-fiction-is-now-an-official-literary-genre-because-marketers-want-you-to-buy-things|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others claimed the readership was not there to publish the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Adult: Needless Marketing-Speak Or Valued Subgenre?|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, others claimed that the term was necessary; a publicist for [[HarperCollins]] described it as "a convenient label because it allows parents and bookstores and interested readers to know what is inside".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beyond Wizards and Vampires, to Sex|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/books/young-adult-authors-add-steaminess-to-their-tales.html?_r=1&amp;|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=19 May 2013|first=Leslie|last=Kaufman|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of books in the new adult genre include Sarah J. Maas' ''A Court of Thorns and Roses'' and ''Throne of Glass'', Jennifer L. Armentrout's ''Wait For You'', Jamie McGuire's ''Beautiful Disaster'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New Adult' books growing up|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20130420/THINGSTODO07/304200030/-New-Adult-books-growing-up|publisher=Lansing State Journal|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colleen Hoover's ''Slammed'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut Fiction on Bestseller Lists|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/emerging-adult-book-genre-puts-smut-fiction-bestseller/story?id=18550587#.UZhSmKLFVqw|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cora Carmack's ''Losing It'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are your teens ready for New Adult fiction?|url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/17501716-423/are-your-teens-ready-for-new-adult-fiction.html|publisher=Sun Times|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Ryan (novelist)|Kendall Ryan]]'s ''The Impact of You''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://happyeverafter.usatoday.com/2013/06/09/kendall-ryan-the-impact-of-you-new-adult/|title=Sexy-romance author Kendall Ryan gives New Adult a try|date=2013-06-09|website=Happy Ever After|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
This category is intended to be marketed to [[Adolescence|post-adolescents]] and [[Young adult (psychology)|young-adults]] ages 18 to 30. This age group is considered to be the lucrative "cross-over" category of young-adult titles that appeal to both the young-adult market and to an adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beckett, Sandra L. |title=Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives|pages= 111, 119–126|date= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers of young-adult fiction now favor this category as it encompasses a far broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sjaejones.com/blog/2009/postadolescent-or-new-adult-fiction/ |title=Postadolescent or 'New Adult' Fiction |author= JJ |date=10 November 2009 |work= Publishing, Reviews |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief features that distinguish the new-adult fiction category from [[young adult fiction]] are the perspective of the young protagonist and the scope of the protagonist's life experience. Perspective is gained as childhood innocence fades and life experience is gained, which brings insight. It is this insight which is lacking in traditional young-adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/books/survey-shows-publishing-expanded-since-2008.html |title=Publishing Gives Hints of Revival, Data Show |first=Julie |last=Bosman |date= August 9, 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2012 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other main differences are characters' ages and the settings. YA does not usually include characters over age 18 or in college, but these characters are featured in new adult books. New adult can best be described as the age category after young adult.

==Themes and issues==
New adult literature touches upon many themes and issues to reach the readership that falls in between the categories of young adult and adult fiction.

Many themes covered in young adult fiction such as identity, sexuality, depression, suicide, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, familial struggles, bullying&lt;ref&gt;[[young adult fiction]]&lt;/ref&gt; are also covered in new adult fiction, but the various issues that are dealt with in the category hold it separate. Some common examples of issues include first jobs, starting college, wedding engagements and marriage, starting new families, friendships post-high school, military enlistment, financial independence, living away from home for the first time, empowerment, loss of innocence, and fear of failure.

This category focuses heavily on life after an individual has become of legal age, and how one deals with the new beginnings of adulthood. Commonly, these themes and issues have been seen taking place post-high school in popular new adult fiction titles, but there are exceptions.

==Genre==
Like the fiction categories of young adult and adult, new adult fiction can combine with all genres and subgenres. [[Science fiction]], [[urban fiction]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Paranormal fiction|paranormal]], [[dystopia]], etc. are some examples.

==Controversies==

===Publishing industry===
Many agents and large publishing houses have yet to recognize the category due to various issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishingcrawl.com/2013/01/30/new-adult-passing-trend-or-legitimate-genre/|title=New Adult- Passing Trend or Legitimate Genre?|date=30 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some view the category as a marketing scheme, while others claim the readership is not there to publish the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html|title=New Adult: Needless Marketing-Speak Or Valued Subgenre?|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, authors have turned to self-publishing as a means to get their books out into the market.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/04/15/new-adult-genre-is-the-hottest-category-in-book-publishing/2022707/ | work=USA Today | first1=Deirdre | last1=Donahue | title=New Adult fiction is the hot new category in books | date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of these authors has led to many independent publishing houses and agents opening up to the category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/2012/11/29/with-new-digital-imprints-random-house-taps-self-published-authors/|title=With new digital imprints, Random House taps self-published authors|first=Laura|last=Owen|date=29 November 2012|website=paidcontent.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers are now publishing these books with many of the bestsellers having deals with large publishers.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

===Sex===
In 2012, new adult fiction saw a rise in the romance subgenre of contemporary when self-published titles such as ''Slammed'' by [[Colleen Hoover]], ''Easy'' by Tamarra Webber, and ''[[Beautiful Disaster (novel)|Beautiful Disaster]]'' by [[Jamie McGuire (author)|Jamie McGuire]] got picked up by major publishing houses. Some believe&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/books/young-adult-authors-add-steaminess-to-their-tales.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Leslie | last=Kaufman | title=Young-Adult Authors Are Creating a Steamy New Genre | date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this jump in response to the category came from the release of the popular erotic novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'', which featured a heroine in college.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Since new adult fiction tackles issues such as sex and sexuality and many of the categories' successful titles deal with those same issues the category itself and the single issue of sex have been stated as synonymous,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; and even been called over-sexualized versions of young adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/emerging-adult-book-genre-puts-smut-fiction-bestseller/story?id=18550587|title=Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut on Top|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=23 February 2013|website=ABC News|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both readers and authors of the category combat the claim by stating that the category deals with the exploration of a character's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/new-adult-its-not-about-the-sex-but-dont-be-afraid-of-the-sex-either/|title=New Adult: It’s not about the sex (but don’t be afraid of the sex either)|date=25 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that sex is not ubiquitous in new adult titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ebscohost.com/novelist/novelist-special/what-is-new-adult-fiction-anyway|title=What is New Adult Fiction, Anyway? - NoveList - EBSCOhost|website=www.ebscohost.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 to present==
Following the end of the St. Martin's Press contest, the new adult category has become increasingly popular through self-publishing.  Major New York publishers are taking self-published authors of these titles and acquiring them for mass market sales.  Some authors include:

*Cora Carmack for ''Losing It''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/self-published-author-signs-a-three-book-deal-heralding-new-adult-fiction/|title=Self-Published Author Signs a Three-Book Deal, Heralding New Adult Fiction|date=14 November 2012|accessdate=14 November 2012|work=The New York Times|first=Leslie|last=Kaufman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to film:

'''[[Film]]''' &amp;ndash; refers to motion pictures as individual projects and to the field in general.  The name came from the fact that [[photographic film]] (also called [[film stock|filmstock]]) has historically been the primary [[Recording medium|medium]] for recording and displaying motion pictures.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is film? ==
Film can be described as all of the following:

* [[Art]] &amp;ndash; aesthetic expression for presentation or performance, and the work produced from this activity.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; as an art form, film is an outlet of human expression, that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture. Film is a physical manifestation of the internal human creative impulse. 
*** One of the [[visual arts]] &amp;ndash; visual arts is a class of art forms, including painting, sculpture, photography, printmaking and others, that focus on the creation of works which are primarily visual in nature.
*** One of the [[performing arts]] &amp;ndash; art forms in which artists use their body, voice, or objects to convey artistic expression. Performing arts include a variety of disciplines but all take the form of a [[performance]] in front of an audience.
*** [[Fine art]] &amp;ndash; in Western European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function. The word "fine" here does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question, but the purity of the discipline according to traditional Western European canons.
* [[Show business]] &amp;ndash; a means of providing employment for [[actor]]s, [[screenwriter]]s, [[artisan]]s and [[technician]]s, regardless of whether the finished film was produced as a [[for-profit]] enterprise or as a [[not-for-profit]] public service.

=== Other names for film ===
* Movies
* Motion pictures
* Pictures
* Celluloid
* Flicks (or flickers)
* Photoplays
* Picture shows
* The cinema
* The silver screen (talkie era); the silver sheet (silent era)
* Videos

==Essence of film==

* [[Filmmaking]] &amp;ndash; process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through scriptwriting, casting, shooting, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition.  Filmmaking is both an art and an industry. Films were originally recorded onto plastic film which was shown through a movie projector onto a large screen (in other words, an analog recording process). The adoption of CGI-based special effects led to the use of digital intermediates. Most contemporary films are now fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition from start to finish.

==Cinematic genres==

[[Film genre]]

===By setting===
*[[Biographical film|Biography]] - portrays a real-life character in his or her real-life story

[[File:Michelangelos Rebellious Slave 3 enhanced.jpg|thumb|Detail]]
The '''''Rebellious Slave''''' is a 2.15m high marble statue by [[Michelangelo]], dated to 1513. It is now held in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].

== History ==
The two "slaves" of the Louvre date to the second version of the [[tomb of Pope Julius II]] which was commissioned by the Pope's heirs, the [[Della Rovere]] in May 1513. Although the initial plans for a gigantic mausoleum were set aside, the work was still monumental, with a corridor richly decorated with sculpture and Michelangelo was immediately put in charge of the work. Among the first pieces completed were the two "''Prigioni''" (renamed the "slaves" only in the nineteenth century), destined for the lower part of the funerary monument, next to the pilasters which framed the niches containing the Victories. Their poses were determined by the needs of this architectural setting, so from the front they have great effect, but the side views received less care than usual.

The date of the two statues is confirmed by a letter of Michelangelo to Marcello dei Covi, in which he speaks of a viewing by [[Luca Signorelli]] in his Roman house, while he worked on "a figure of marble, standing four cubits high, which has its hands behind its back".

All the "''Prigioni''" produced in the studio of the artist were eliminated from the monument in its final version, completed in 1542. In 1546 Michelangelo gave the two works in the Louvre to [[Roberto Strozzi]], for his generous hospitality in his Roman house during Michelangelo's periods of sickness in July 1544 and June 1546. When Strozzi was exiled to [[Lyon]] in April 1550 for his opposition to [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]], he had the two statues sent ahead. In April 1578 they were put on view in two niches in the courtyard of the castle of the [[constable]] of [[Montmorency, Val-d'Oise|Montmorency]] at [[Écouen]], near [[Paris]].

In 1632 they were sold by Henri II de Montmorency to [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who had them sent to his [[Château de Richelieu|Château]] in [[Poitou]], where they were seen by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]] who made an illustration of them, on his travels.

In 1749, the Duke of Richelieu had them taken to Paris and placed in the [[Pavillon de Hanovre]]. They were hidden in 1793, but when the widow of the last Marshal of Richelieu attempted to put them on sale, they became property of the government and joined the collection which is now in the Louvre.

== Description and style ==
The "Rebellious Slave" is portrayed trying to free himself from the fetters which hold his hands behind his back, contorting his torso and twisting his head. The impression given, which would have contributed to the spatial appearance of the monument, was that he was moving towards the viewer, with his raised shoulder and knee.  

The iconographic significance of the two figures is probably linked to the motif of the Captive in Roman art; in fact [[Giorgio Vasari]] identified them as personifications of the provinces controlled by Julius II. For [[Ascanio Condivi]], however, they symbolised the Arts taken prisoner after the death of pontif. The ''Rebellious Slave'' in particular might, speculatively, represent sculpture or architecture. Other meanings of a symbolic and philosophical nature have been suggested as well as some linked to Michelangelo's personal life and his "torments".

From a stylistic point of view, they are based on [[Greek sculpture|ancient models]], particularly [[Hellenistic sculpture]], like the statue group of ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'', discovered in 1506 and at that time in Michelangelo's possession, but also the sculptural friezes on the [[triumphal arch]]es of Rome and depictions of [[Saint Sebastian]].

In the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], [[icon]]s serve much the same purpose as they do in the rest of the worldwide [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]]. The art of painting them has seen a revival after the end of the [[Communist Romania|communist period]], and today there are many active icon painters in [[Romania]].

In Romania, [[icons]] painted as reversed images on glass and set in frames were common in the 19th century and are still made. "In the Transylvanian countryside, the expensive icons on panels imported from Moldavia, Wallachia, and Mt. Athos were gradually replaced by small, locally produced icons on glass, which were much less expensive and thus accessible to the Transylvanian peasants..." (Romanian Icons on Glass, Dancu, Juliana and Dumitru Dancu, Wayne State University Press, 1982).

[[File:Save Outdoor Sculpture! (logo).jpg|thumb|222px|right|The SOS! Logo]]

'''Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!)''' is a community-based effort to identify, document, and conserve outdoor sculpture in the [[United States of America|United States]]. By fostering awareness and appreciation, SOS! aims to advocate proper care of a nationwide public resource. 

The SOS! project may be viewed as a precursor of community-generated or "crowd-sourced" social media-driven initiatives.  

==History==
Save Outdoor Sculpture! was initiated by [[Heritage Preservation|Heritage Preservation: The National Institute of Conservation]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications/newsletters/22_2/news_in_cons1.html|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture!: A Community-Based Conservation Program, Getty Conservation Institute Newsletter 22.2 (Summer 2007)|accessdate=2009-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus far over 7,000 volunteers have cataloged and assessed the condition of over 30,000 publicly accessible statues and monuments installed outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/Programs/Sos/aboutsos.htm|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture! About Page|accessdate=2009-04-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108041805/http://www.heritagepreservation.org/Programs/SOS/aboutsos.htm|archivedate=2009-01-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smithsonian Museum of American Art has become an active partner in the SOS! project, and SOS! material is available online as part of the Inventory of American Sculpture at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siris.si.edu/|title=The Inventory is part of the Smithsonian Institution Research Information System|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership has allowed the database that contains these records to be viewable online, and [http://sirismm.si.edu/siris/ariquickstart.htm searchable by state], [http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1HD764961858K.5006&amp;profile=ariall&amp;menu=search&amp;submenu=Browse&amp;ts=1337649618636 artist, subject or title].  The records in the Inventory pertain to all sculpture in the United States and a few outlying islands that have thus far been identified.

==Educational programs==
A primary objective  of SOS! is to educate, and a number of programs have been created for children. For example, SOS! has partnered with the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] to create a Girl Scout patch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagepreservation.org/PDFS/gsupdate.pdf|title=Save Outdoor Sculpture! Girl Scout Patch Program|accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for scouts who participate in the project.

Actual skulls and bones were long used to mark the entrances to [[Spain|Spanish]] cemeteries (''campo santo''). The practice, dating back many centuries, led to the symbol eventually becoming associated with the concept of [[death]]. Some [[crucifix]]es feature a skull and crossbones beneath the corpus (the depiction of [[Jesus|Jesus']]  body), in reference to a legend that the place of the crucifixion was also the burial place of [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] or, more likely, in reference to the [[New Testament]] statement (King James Version: Matthew 27:33, Mark 15:22, and John 19:17) that the place of his crucifixion was called "[[Golgotha]]" (tr. "the Place of a Skull").

Today, an example of a real skull and crossbones may be seen in the 1732 [[Our Lady of the Pillar|Nuestra Señora del Pilar]] church overlooking the famous [[La Recoleta Cemetery|Recoleta Cemetery]] in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. It contains several altars rescued from other early Spanish churches in South America. One of these has twenty rectangular window boxes arrayed behind and above the altar, five wide by four tall. The size of these glass window boxes is such that the femurs of the priests thus interred are a bit too long to lie flat and so must be leaned up in an "X" formation. The other bones fill in the spaces around the femurs with the skull sitting prominently on top of the bone pile centered above the "X".

==Other countries==
The [[Jolly Roger]], and the similar [[Totenkopf]] was a popular symbol of mortality across at this time across Europe and has its origins in the mediaeval [[Danse Macabre]].

Tombstones from the 18th century in Southern Scotland fairly frequently feature skull and crossbones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinphoto.org.uk/0_a_l/0_around_edinburgh_-_leith_north_leith_cemetery_01777+01778_no_name.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of St Nicholas in [[Deptford]] features two [[Totenkopf | Deaths Head]]s on its gateposts dating to the early 18th century.

The '''Speed Art Museum''', originally known as the '''J.B. Speed Memorial Museum''', now colloquially referred to as '''the Speed'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards Hill|first=Toya|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2002/08/05/story3.html|title=Speed show expected to bolster local economy|work=Louisville Business First|date=August 5, 2002|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; by locals,  is the oldest, largest, and foremost [[museum]] of [[art]] in [[Kentucky]]. It is located in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] on Third Street next to the [[University of Louisville]] Belknap campus and receives around 180,000 visits annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=anon|first=anon|url=http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3911|title=The Speed Art Museum|work=Charity Navigator|date=2016|accessdate=June 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum offers visitors a variety of "art experiences" outside its collection and international exhibitions, including the Speed Concert Series, the [[Art Sparks Interactive Family Gallery]], and the popular late-night event, ''Art After Dark''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisville.com/content/speed-museum-brings-you-art-after-dark|title=Speed Museum brings you Art After Dark|author=Lou|date=September 28, 2009|work=Louisville.com|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Speed houses [[Arts of the ancient world|ancient]], [[Renaissance Classicism|classical]], and [[modern art]] from around the world. The focus of the collection is Western art, from antiquity to the present day. Holdings of paintings from the Netherlands, French and Italian works, and contemporary art are particularly strong, with sculpture prominent throughout.

==History==

The museum was built in 1927 by [[Arthur Loomis]] in the [[Neo-Classical style]]. Loomis was already well known in Louisville for landmarks like the Louisville Medical College and Levi Brothers'. The original building was designed as an understated [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] limestone facade. [[Hattie Bishop Speed]] established the museum in memorial of her husband [[James Breckenridge Speed]], a prominent Louisville businessman, art collector, and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;Leary, James. "Ghosts, Raspberries, and the Legacy of Hattie Speed" '' The Speed Member Magazine'' Fall 2009 p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Ms. Speed set up the endowment to fund the museum, encouraging the museum to never charge admission.

The museum underwent a $60 million expansion and renovation project from September 2012 to March 2016, designed by architect [[Kulapat Yantrasast]] of wHY architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/arts/design/speed-museum-turns-to-a-spreadsheet-to-increase-diversity.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Loos|first=Ted|date=March 15, 2016|title=Speed Museum Turns to a Spreadsheet to Increase Diversity|access-date=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the closure, the museum opened Local Speed, a satellite space in Louisville's [[East Market District]] (NuLu) for rotating exhibitions, programs and events. Local Speed is located at 822 East Market Street.

The 62,500-square-foot North Building doubled the overall square footage and nearly tripled the gallery space from the previous wing. The expansion created a space for larger special exhibitions, new contemporary art galleries, a family education welcome center, 150-seat theater, indoor/outdoor café, museum shop, and a multifunctional pavilion for performances, lectures and entertaining. Additionally, the new Elizabeth P. and Frederick K. Cressman Art Park and public Piazza was created for the display of sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedmuseum.org/about/history/|title=History|website=speedmuseum.org|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Timeline&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Speed Art Museum.'' Louisville, KY: The Speed Art Museum, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

1927 – The Speed Art Museum is built. More than 74,000 visitors fill the museum in the first year.

1928 – The centenary of Kentucky portrait painter [[Matthew Harris Jouett]] is celebrated with a major exhibition of his portraits, many owned by prominent Louisvillians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jouett Centenary: Portraits Shown at Speed Museum|work=[[The Courier-Journal]]|date=February 26, 1928|location=Louisville, Kentucky|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1933 – The museum is incorporated as a privately endowed institution and its [[board of governors]] was established.

1934 – The museum received its first major [[donation]], a valuable collection of [[North American Indian]] artifacts given by Dr. Frederick Weygold.

1941 – Dr. Preston Pope Satterwhite makes a significant gift to the museum – his collection of 15th century and 16th century French and Italian [[Decorative Arts]] including [[tapestries]] and [[furniture]].

1944 – Satterwhite donates the [[English Renaissance]] room, which was moved in its entirety from [[Devon]], England. Dr. Satterwhite's gift necessitated an enlargement of the museum and in his will he provided for the addition that bears his name. Completed in 1954, it was the first of three additions to the original building.

1946 – Paul S. Harris becomes the first professional director of the museum. During his tenure, acquisitions to the collection were made mostly in the areas of decorative arts and furniture.

1964 – Recently donated paintings and furniture from the collection of Mrs. W. Blakemore Wheeler go on view including works by [[Mary Cassatt]], [[John Constable]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Maurice Utrillo]], and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]].

1966 – Charter Collectors Group forms to assist museum in the acquisition of pre-1940 art.

1970 – New Art Collectors Group forms to assist museum to acquire [[contemporary art]].

1973 – The North Wing of the museum opens, giving new space for a theatre, offices, indoor sculpture court, and library.

1977 – The Speed celebrates its 50th anniversary in 1977 with the acquisition of Rembrandt's ''Portrait of a Woman'', one of the museum's most significant acquisitions.

1983 – The 1983 Wing opens, designed by Robert Geddes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soa.princeton.edu/content/robert-geddes|title=Robert Geddes|website=princeton.edu|accessdate=March 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Princeton. The new wing adds much-needed gallery space for permanent collections and special exhibitions.

1996 – Mrs. Alice Speed Stoll dies, leaving behind an [[estate (land)|estate]] that bequeaths over $50 million to the museum. The Speed closes to undertake an extensive renovation and renaissance. Newer lighting, heating and cooling systems, bold wall colors, multi-layered labels about the collection, and the Laramie L. Learning Center, [[Art Sparks Interactive Family Gallery]] are put into place.

1997 – The museum reopens.

2012 – The museum begins another major transition with a $60 million expansion project that will create a space for larger special exhibitions, new contemporary art galleries, a family education welcome center, 150-seat theater, indoor/outdoor café, museum shop, and a multifunctional pavilion for performances, lectures and entertaining. The museum is closed to the public for three years during the construction period.

2013 – The Speed staff relocates offsite to the downtown Louisville neighborhood of Nulu and opens Local Speed, a satellite space for exhibitions, family activities, programs and special events.

2016 – The museum reopens on March 12 with a 30-hour celebration.

'''''The Bay Lights''''' is a [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] monumental light sculpture and [[generative art]] installation on the western span of the [[San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge]], designed to commemorate the 75th&amp;nbsp;anniversary of its opening. The installation by light artist [[Leo Villareal]] includes 25,000 individual white [[Led|LEDs]] along {{convert|1.8|mi}} of the cables on the north side of the suspension span of the bridge between [[Yerba Buena Island]] and [[San Francisco]]. The installation is controlled via a computer and displays changing patterns that are not meant to repeat. The opening ceremony was held on March&amp;nbsp;5, 2013.

Initially intended as a temporary installation, which ended on March&amp;nbsp;5, 2015, the project was re-installed as a longstanding feature of the Bay Bridge with permanent fixtures that were re-lit on January&amp;nbsp;30, 2016.

==Origin==
''The Bay Lights'' was conceived in September 2010 by Ben Davis of Words Pictures Ideas, a public relations company that has a contract with the [[Caltrans|California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans) for publicizing the construction of the [[Eastern span replacement of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge|new eastern span replacement]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Bridge|Bay Bridge]] between Yerba Buena Island and Oakland.&lt;ref name="whiting"&gt;{{cite news |last=Whiting|first=Sam |title=Bay Bridge to beam vivid light sculpture |url= http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/Bay-Bridge-to-beam-vivid-light-sculpture-3872898.php |accessdate=18 January 2013 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis characterized the Bay Bridge as being overshadowed by the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], which is a popular tourist destination for visitors to San Francisco, and he hoped this art project would give the Bay Bridge more recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McMenamin|first=Dan |title=Art project to illuminate Bay Bridge |url= http://www.sfexaminer.com/local/2012/09/art-project-illuminate-bay-bridge |accessdate=19 January 2013 |newspaper=Bay City News via [[San Francisco Examiner]] |date=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Davis contacted light artist Leo Villareal, who had an exhibition on display at the [[San Jose Museum of Art]] in late 2010.&lt;ref name="whiting"/&gt;  Davis later founded [[Illuminate the Arts]], a non-profit organization, to organize the sculpture's design, engineering, and fundraising.

Both Davis and Villareal suggest ''The Bay Lights'' was influenced by their experiences at the annual [[Burning Man]] art and music festival in northwestern [[Nevada]].  Villareal first attended Burning Man in 1994 and eventually joined the board of directors of the Burning Man organization. His prototype light sculpture was 16 blinking lights in a grid that was meant to be a beacon when returning to his camp at night.&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt;  From there, Villareal has programmed more complex light matrices and exhibitions, including his largest, "Multiverse," a 41,000 LED installation on permanent display at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref name="whiting"/&gt;

==Operations==

The sculpture is visible mostly from the north side of the bridge and is most easily seen from the San Francisco waterfront. The lights are positioned to be invisible to bridge motorists, to prevent driver distractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cuff|first=Dennis |title=25,000 lights to turn Bay Bridge span into giant night sculpture |url= http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_22269815/25-000-lights-turn-bay-bridge-span-into? |accessdate=18 January 2013 |newspaper=[[Contra Costa Times]] |date=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The installation operates from dusk until dawn daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2013/10/16/the-bay-lights-led-sculpture-to-extend-hours-in-november/ |title=The Bay Lights LED Sculpture To Extend Hours In November |date=October 16, 2013 |work=Bay City News Service |publisher=KPIX-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
The 25,000 white [[LED]]s were attached by construction workers along the vertical steel support cables that connect the deck of the bridge to the suspension cables at the top. Caltrans workers intermittently closed a lane of traffic on the bridge late at night so electricians could install the individual LEDs to the cables.&lt;ref name="fischer"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fischer|first=Adam |title=Bright Idea |url= http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/bright-idea/ |accessdate=18 January 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="musiker"&gt;{{cite news |last=Musiker|first=Cy |title=Bay Bridge Lightshow on Schedule For March Debut |url= http://www.kqed.org/news/story/2012/12/07/112375/bay_bridge_lighting_project_on_schedule_for_march?category=bay+area |accessdate=19 January 2013 |publisher=[[KQED]] |date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lights are programmed to create a series of abstract patterns that ascend and descend the cables and appear to cross the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kuang|first=Cliff |title=Big-Time Techies Want To Turn SF’s Bay Bridge Into A Glittering Light Show |url= http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670002/big-time-techies-want-to-turn-sfs-bay-bridge-into-a-glittering-light-show |accessdate=18 January 2013 |newspaper=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]] |date=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Villareal said the patterns will be inspired by weather patterns, tides, and the volume of traffic on the bridge at any given time.&lt;ref name="sharpe"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sharpe|first=Katherine |title=Everything Will Be Illuminated: Artist to Cover Bay Bridge in Programmable LEDs |url= https://www.wired.com/design/2012/05/bay-lights/ |accessdate=18 January 2013 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The lights need {{convert|100000|ft}} of special cabling to power the installation, as well as for networking and communications with the control computer. The lights are spaced every {{convert|12|in|cm}} and are attached to the bridge with 60,000 zip ties.&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt;  Each LED bulb can be adjusted for 255 different levels of brightness and the entire installation is controlled remotely by a computer program operated by Villareal.&lt;ref name="whiting"/&gt; The LED lights complement the permanent string of lights that has been attached to the suspension cables since the 50th&amp;nbsp;anniversary of the bridge in 1986.&lt;ref name="whiting"/&gt;

The original, temporary installation, which formally opened on March&amp;nbsp;5, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2013/03/06/the-bay-lights-officially-unveiled-on-bay-bridge/ |title= ‘The Bay Lights’ Officially Unveiled On Bay Bridge |date= March 6, 2013 |work= |publisher= [[KPIX-TV]] |accessdate= March 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was taken down in March 2015 when its permits expired so that Caltrans could repaint and perform maintenance on the cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Bay-Lights-Project-Removed-for-Caltrans-Maintenance-on-Bay-Bridge-295077881.html |title=Bay Lights Go Dark for Caltrans Maintenance on Bay Bridge |first=Joe |last=Rosato Jr. |date=4 March 2015 |work=NBC Bay Area |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Installation of more robust, permanent lights began in October 2015, and a re-lighting ceremony was held on January 30, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bay-Bridge-Lights-Set-to-Shine-Once-Again-6559014.php |title=Bay Lights set to shine once again |first=Douglas |last=Zimmerman |date=9 October 2015 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="egelko"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Egelko|first1=Bob|title=Bay Bridge light show will go on|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Bay-Bridge-light-show-will-go-on-5964267.php|publisher=SF Gate|accessdate=6 February 2015|date=17 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuff"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/breaking-news/ci_29446187/bay-bridge-light-sculpture-turns-back-saturday-night |title=Bay Bridge light sculpture turns back on Saturday night |first=Denis |last=Cuff |date=28 January 2016 |work=Bay Area News Group |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  after which the lights were gifted to the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/morning_call/2016/01/bay-lights-art-installation-bridge-tourism.html |title=Bay Lights art installation to shine again for Super Bowl 50 festivities |first=Todd |last=Johnson |date=29 January 2016 |work=San Francisco Business Times |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new lights are brighter and better able to weather the elements and angled such that they are visible from south of the bridge as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ww2.kqed.org/arts/2016/01/29/the-bay-bridge-lights-return-for-an-unlimited-engagement/ |title=The Bay Bridge Lights Return for an Unlimited Engagement |first=Cy |last=Musiker |date=29 January 2016 |work=KQED |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
The initial project cost $8&amp;nbsp;million, which was raised through private donations and contributions.&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Fixes-funding-brighten-Bay-Lights-day-4602033.php |title=Fixes, funding brighten 'Bay Lights' day |first=Michael |last=Cabanatuan |date=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  50&amp;nbsp;million people were estimated to see ''The Bay Lights'' by 2015,&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt; and the project was estimated to bring up to $100&amp;nbsp;million in tourism revenue to the Bay Area.&lt;ref name="sharpe"/&gt; [[ZERO1 (nonprofit)|ZERO1]], a non-profit dedicated to bringing art and technology together, signed on as the official fiscal sponsor of the project.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev.thebaylights.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/The_Bay_Lights_Press_Facts.pdf |title=The Bay Lights Press Facts Sheet |accessdate=June 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bay Lights'' is estimated to use approximately $30 per day in electricity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoge|first=Patrick |title=Huge Bay Bridge light project going ahead |url= http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/2012/09/bay-bridge-light-project-going-ahead.html |accessdate=18 January 2013 |newspaper=[[San Francisco Business Times]] |date=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about $11,000 annually. During the temporary installation period, these costs were covered by a private solar investment company in the form of solar credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tarantola|first=Andrew |title=Art Backers Want to Light Up The Bay Bridge |url= https://gizmodo.com/5867523/art-backers-want-to-light-up-the-bay-bridge |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Illuminate the Arts announced it was partnering with [[Tilt.com]] to sponsor a $1.2 million crowdfunding campaign to keep ''The Bay Lights'' lit until 2026.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kung|first1=Michelle|title=Let There Be Light: 40 Days to Save the Bay Lights|url=http://blog.tilt.com/let-light-40-days-save-bay-lights/|website=Tilt Blog|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the crowdfunding campaign raised less than expected, organizers focused on larger donors and ultimately raised the $4 million necessary to install long-term fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/4-million-needed-to-save-Bay-Lights-on-Bay-5841174.php |title=$4 million needed to save 'Bay Lights’ on Bay Bridge |first=John |last=King |date=23 October 2014 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Bay Area Toll Authority]], which oversees the bridge, agreed to allocate up to $250,000 per year from toll revenues for maintenance and electricity.&lt;ref name="egelko"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Since its inauguration, ''The Bay Lights'' has received widespread public support and positive reaction, as well as political support from state and local politicians, including [[Jerry Brown|Governor Jerry Brown]], [[Gavin Newsom|Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom]], [[Ed Lee (politician)|San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee]], the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] and former [[Willie Brown (politician)|San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown]].&lt;ref name="fischer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sharpe"/&gt;

''[[Hemispheres (magazine)|Hemispheres]]'' named ''The Bay Lights'' the top attraction in its 2013 "Out with the Old, In with the New" Top-25 feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Out With the Old |url= http://www.hemispheresmagazine.com/2013/01/01/out-with-the-old/ |accessdate=19 January 2013 |publisher=[[United Airlines]] |work=[[Hemispheres (magazine)|Hemispheres]] |date=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March&amp;nbsp;8, 2014, the documentary ''Impossible Light'' world premiered at the [[SXSW|SXSW Film Festival]]. The film follows the people who wished to produce ''The Bay Lights'' as they search for funding and obtain permits. The ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' felt that the documentary was a nearly seamless extraction of the evolutionary relationship between art and benefaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/screens/2014-03-12/sxsw-film-review-impossible-light/ |title=SXSW Film Review: 'Impossible Light' – |last=Winkler |first=Jeff |date=March 12, 2014 |work=Austin Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also screened as part of the 57th [[San Francisco International Film Festival]] and the [[Newport Beach Film Festival]] in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sffs.org/festival-home/attend/film-guide/impossible-light#.UzyRfq1dWjQ|title=Looking Ahead to SFIFF59|work=San Francisco Film Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://newportbeach2014.festivalgenius.com/2014/films/impossiblelight_jeremyambers_newportbeach2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''The Golden Key''''' is a [[fairy tale]] written by [[George MacDonald]].  It was published in ''Dealings with the Fairies'' (1867).

It is particularly noted for the intensity of the suggestive imagery, which implies a spiritual meaning to the story without providing a transparent allegory for the events in it.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Manlove, ''Christian Fantasy: from 1200 to the Present'' p nope168-9 {{ISBN|0-268-00790-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
A young boy listens to his Great-aunt's stories about a magical golden key found at the end of a rainbow.  One day, he sees an immense rainbow and sets out to find its end in an [[Enchanted forest|enchanted forest]]. As the forest is in [[Fairy]]land where everything has an opposite effect, the rainbow only glows brighter when the sun sets. He finds the key, then it dawns on him that he does not know where the lock is.

In the same village on the border of this forest, a merchant's neglected daughter is frightened by the [[Fairy|fairies]].  Their first attempt fails but when they make her think [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|the three bears]] are coming into her bedroom, she flees into the woods.

A tree tries to trap her, but a feathered airborne fish frees her, then leads her to a wise woman's cottage. A pot is boiling there, and the air fish flies into it.  The lady asks her name; the girl says that the servants always called her Tangle, and the lady decides that although her tangled hair was their fault for not looking after her, Tangle is a pretty name.  She says she is called Grandmother, and that it has been three years since Tangle ran away from the "bears".  She has the girl washed by fish and dresses her. Then they eat the air fish for dinner after the lady assures her that the air fish had voluntarily gone into the pot to be their food, and the cooking pot produces a little-winged figure, who flies off.

The lady sends another air fish after the young man at the foot of the rainbow.  At supper the next day, the young man, Mossy, arrives.  The lady tells Mossy that if he searches for the keyhole, he will find it, and sends Tangle with him. In their wanderings, they come across a valley where beautiful shadows fill the air, where they stay, grow old, and then resolve to find the land the marvelous shadows fall from; but they become separated so they each continue their journey alone.

Tangle meets with the winged [[Aeranthes|aëranth]] (air-flower) that used to be the fish, who leads her to the mountain. There she meets the [[Old Man of the Sea]].  He can not tell her the way to the land from which the shadows fall and send her to his brother the Old Man of the Earth.  He also does not know and sends her to the Old Man of the Fire.

: Then the Old Man of the Earth stooped over the floor of the cave, raised a huge stone from it, and left it leaning. It disclosed a great hole that went [[Vertical direction|plumb-down]].
:"That is the way," he said.
:"But there are no stairs."
:"You must throw yourself in. There is no other way."

She throws herself in and at the end of the hole, finds the Old Man of the Fire. This Old Man turns out to be youngest of all, a wise child arranging colored spheres in a significant way. After giving her protection from the fiery path, he sends her out following a snake, which will lead her to that land.

Mossy also finds the Man of the Sea, rightly recognizing him as death, and he gains the power to walk across the sea. After climbing a precipice, he enters a chamber where the colors of the rainbow appear as columns of light.&lt;ref&gt;"Unlocking Wonder in 'The Golden Key'", Ruth Sanderson [http://www.worksofmacdonald.com/ruth-sanderson-unlocking-wonder/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Tangle is waiting for him. She shows him another door that his key unlocks, opening onto a glowing stairway to the land they were searching for, from which the shadows fall.  As they start to climb, the story ends.

==1967 edition==
An edition was published in 1967 by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] with illustrations by [[Maurice Sendak]] and an Afterword by [[W. H. Auden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/golden-key/oclc/762195659 ''The Golden Key'' 1967 edition] at [[WorldCat]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Perfect Storm''''' is a 2000 American [[biographical film|biographical]] [[Disaster film|disaster]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Wolfgang Petersen]] and based on the 1997 [[non-fiction]] [[The Perfect Storm (book)|book of the same name]] by [[Sebastian Junger]]. The film tells the story of the ''[[Andrea Gail]]'', a commercial fishing vessel that was lost at sea with all hands after being caught in the [[1991 Perfect Storm|Perfect Storm of 1991]]. The film stars [[George Clooney]], [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[William Fichtner]], [[Michael Ironside]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Diane Lane]], [[Karen Allen]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]].&lt;ref name="reelviews"&gt;Berardinelli, James, [http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/p/perfect_storm.html The Perfect Storm Film Review] – reelviews.net, 2000 (Retrieved on 2007-01-25)&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on June 30, 2000, by [[Warner Bros.]]

== Plot ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Perfect Storm1.jpg|left|frame]] --&gt;
In October 1991, the commercial fishing boat ''[[Andrea Gail]]'' returns to port in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]], with a poor catch. Desperate for money, Captain Billy Tyne ([[George Clooney|Clooney]]) convinces the ''Andrea Gail'' crew to join him for one more late season fishing expedition. The crew heads out past their usual fishing grounds on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], leaving a developing [[tropical storm]] behind them. Initially unsuccessful, they head to the [[Flemish Cap]], where their luck greatly improves. At the height of their fishing, the ice machine breaks; the only way to sell their catch before it spoils is to hurry back to shore. After debating whether to sail through the building storm or to wait it out, the crew decides to risk the storm. However, between ''Andrea Gail'' and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a [[Hurricane Grace|hurricane]], which the ''Andrea Gail'' crew underestimates.

After repeated warnings from other ships, ''Andrea Gail'' loses her antenna, forcing Captain [[Linda Greenlaw]] ([[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio|Mastrantonio]]) of sister ship ''Hannah Boden'' to call in a [[Mayday (distress signal)|Mayday]]. A [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60 Pave Hawk]] rescue helicopter responds, but after failing to perform a midair refueling with an [[HC-130 Hercules]], the helicopter crew ditch their aircraft. All but one of the [[Air National Guard]] crew members are rescued by a [[USCG Medium Endurance Cutter#Reliance class cutters|Coast Guard vessel]], the [[USCGC Tamaroa (WMEC-166)|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']].

After ''Andrea Gail'' endures various problems, the crew struggles to sail through pounding waves and shrieking winds, while friends and family worry and wait for a ship that never comes home. The vessel encounters an enormous [[rogue wave]]. They attempt to drive the boat over the wave but it crests before it can get to the top and is overturned; Billy elects to [[The captain goes down with the ship|go down with his ship]], the rest of the crew are trapped inside and only one, rookie fisherman Bobby Shatford ([[Mark Wahlberg|Wahlberg]]), manages to get out. He surfaces and watches as ''Andrea Gail'' rights herself before sinking stern-first into the Atlantic. As Bobby silently says his goodbyes to his loved ones, the rapidly rising swell carries him away.

There are no survivors; Linda reads the eulogy at the memorial, followed by her remembering Billy's voice soliloquising about what it means to be a swordboat captain.

==Cast==
*[[George Clooney]] as Frank William "Billy" Tyne, Jr., captain of ''[[Andrea Gail]]'', a swordfishing boat. Billy is a divorced father of two daughters, who is determined to undertake one last fishing trip before the end of the season to make up for a recent string of poor catches.
*[[Mark Wahlberg]] as Robert "Bobby" Shatford, the least experienced of the crew of ''Andrea Gail''. Bobby is the son of Ethel Shatford, the owner of the Crow's Nest, and boyfriend to Chris Cotter. He enjoys commercial fishing, but his deepening relationship with Chris (coupled with her reluctance to let him sail again) creates conflict within himself and between the couple. Yet, he is compelled by the potential to earn more money at sea than he could make with a job on shore to sign on for one last trip.
*[[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]] as [[Linda Greenlaw]], the captain of ''Hannah Boden''. Linda and Billy both captain ships for the same owner and maintain a friendly rivalry. She is concerned about Billy and his crew's going out in what she considers dangerous weather. Linda is the last to speak to ''Andrea Gail''.
*[[Diane Lane]] as Christina "Chris" Cotter, girlfriend of Bobby Shatford. She does not want Bobby to go on the trip because of a bad feeling she has about it. She spends her time during the last fishing trip decorating an apartment she has rented as a surprise for Bobby to symbolize her commitment to him. 
*[[John C. Reilly]] as Dale "Murph" Murphy, crewmember on ''Andrea Gail''. Murph is a veteran fisherman who is divorced with a son with whom he's very involved. Murph has a rocky relationship with crewmember David "Sully" Sullivan that is eventually resolved during the trip.
*[[William Fichtner]] as David "Sully" Sullivan, crewmember on ''Andrea Gail''. He signed on for the trip at the last minute when another fisherman suddenly backed out. Sully and Murph initially have an antagonistic relationship that is fueled in part by Sully's past involvement with Murph's ex-wife, although the details are not made clear in the film. The relationship is eventually resolved during the trip.
*[[Michael Ironside]] as Bob Brown, owner of ''Andrea Gail'' and ''Hannah Boden''. Although Brown seems to harbor a deep-seated recognition of Tyne's skills at catching fish, he nevertheless pressures Tyne over the latter's recent inability to bring in larger hauls, resulting in an uneasy relationship between the two.
*[[Bob Gunton]] as Alexander McAnally III, owner of ''Mistral'', a yacht caught in the storm.
*[[Karen Allen]] as Melissa Brown, crewmember on ''Mistral''.
*[[Cherry Jones]] as Edie Bailey, crewmember on ''Mistral''.
*[[Allen Payne]] as Alfred Pierre, one of the crew of ''Andrea Gail''.
*[[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as Michael "Bugsy" Moran, a member of ''Andrea Gail'''s crew. Bugsy's somewhat comic inability to connect with women appears to change on the eve of the trip, when he meets a divorced mother at the Crow's Nest, who later comes to the dock to see him off. They hint at the prospect of a budding relationship that fatefully never materializes.
*[[Janet Wright]] as Ethel Shatford, Bobby's mother.
* [[Christopher McDonald]] as [[Todd Gross]], a Boston [[Meteorology|meteorologist]] working for the WNEV-TV (the present day [[WHDH-TV]]).
*[[Dash Mihok]] as Sergeant Jeremy Mitchell, a crewmember on the [[New York Air National Guard]] rescue helicopter.

== Historical accuracy ==
===The Andrea Gail===
[[File:Hurricane Grace (1991).JPG|thumb|left|Hurricane Grace on October 28, 1991, when the Andrea Gail went missing.]]

A ship similar to ''Andrea Gail'', ''Lady Grace'', was used during the filming of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warnerbros.com/studio/news/“-perfect-storm’s”-“andrea-gail”-comes-home-massachusetts|title=''The Perfect Storm's'' ''Andrea Gail'' Comes Home to Massachusetts|publisher=Warner Bros.|date=July 14, 2000|accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Candus Thomson| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-06-23/features/0006230001_1_andrea-gail-lady-grace-perfect-storm |title=Ocean City boat sails off to stardom |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=June 23, 2000|accessdate=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the names used were not changed for the fictional film, but in response two [[The Perfect Storm (film)#Lawsuits|lawsuits]] were later filed by certain families of the crew members. The film only claims to be "based on a true story", and differs in many ways from the [[The Perfect Storm (book)|book]] starting with the fictionalization of the material into a "story". The events shown in the film after the Andrea Gail's last radio contact are pure speculation, as the boat and the bodies of the crew were never found.

Contrary to the movie's storyline, Captain Linda Greenlaw says she did not place a distress call on behalf of ''Andrea Gail''. "Without a distress call (directly) from the imperiled vessel, the [[U.S. Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] will not initiate a search until the vessel is five days overdue in port," Greenlaw said. The 1993 U.S. Coast Guard's investigative report said that ''Andrea Gail'' was experiencing 30-foot waves and winds from anywhere from 50 to 80 knots &lt;small&gt;(58 - 92 MPH)&lt;/small&gt; around the time of the last communication. The conditions, though threatening, were probably not unfamiliar to Tyne, who had been a successful fisherman for about a decade on other vessels, taking trips to the Grand Banks and fishing off Florida, the Carolinas, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="GAIL"&gt;[http://www.offsoundings.com/WEB%20PDF/PERFECT_STORM_20TH_ANNIVERSARY.pdf What really happened to the Andrea Gail?]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Hurricane Grace (1991)]] was described by a weather forecaster as a [[Saffir–Simpson scale|category 5]] storm in the movie, though it never achieved those wind speeds. In the movie, Tyne and his crew agreed to head into the dangerous storm in order to save their fish from spoiling. Greenlaw acknowledged that Tyne did mention having ice problems, but that was not unusual. "My one gripe about [the] movie was how Warner Brothers depicted Billy Tyne and his crew as making a very conscious decision to steam into a storm that they knew was dangerous," said Greenlaw. "That is not what happened. ''Andrea Gail'' was three days into their steam home when the storm hit. Whatever happened to ''Andrea Gail'' happened very quickly."&lt;ref name="GAIL" /&gt;

An Air National Guard helicopter was dispatched from [[Francis S. Gabreski Air National Guard Base]] on [[Long Island, New York]], but not in response to the Andrea Gail or Satori (''Mistral'' in the movie). The helicopter departed mid-storm on a mission to help save a lone Japanese fisherman from a sinking sailboat 250 miles off the New Jersey coast. Unsuccessful and running low on fuel, the Air National Guard HH-60G helicopter was compelled to attempt a mid-flight refueling maneuver. The zero-visibility conditions thwarted their efforts, however, and lacking enough fuel to make the flight back to the Long Island base, the crew were forced to ditch the helicopter. After a search by ''Tamaroa'', four of the HH-60's crew were picked up; one was never seen again.  The Japanese yachtsman was later rescued by a Romanian cargo ship.&lt;ref name="GAIL" /&gt;

When asked about the portrayal of "Sully" in the movie, Cathy Sullivan Mustone, an older sister of David "Sully" Sullivan, said she was disappointed. "They made my brother's character out to be a hothead," she said. "I guess every movie needs a villain, but my brother was a funny guy with a loud laugh and a big smile. He had a lot of guts and he loved fishing." In fact, David's bravery and quick thinking made headlines on a different boat—''Harmony''. One night during a winter fishing trip, ''Harmony'' began taking on water while tied to another boat. The crew of ''Harmony'' yelled for help, hoping to wake the nearby crew. No one woke, so David dove into the icy water, pulling himself on the ropes that tied the boats together. As a result of his bravery, ''Harmony'''s crew was saved. Mustone said, "At least in the movie, they did represent my brother's bravery in a water rescue scene. He was a good man. And I just know he is at peace in heaven, safe with our Dad."&lt;ref name="GAIL" /&gt;

===The Satori===

The crew members of ''Satori'' (renamed ''Mistral'' in the movie) were not rescued by an [[Air National Guard]] helicopter, but rather a [[U.S. Coast Guard]] helicopter.  The helicopter was changed in the film after the Air National Guard had issues consulting with the movie producers. According to the owner's son, ''Satori'' never made a 360° roll, although it had two knockdowns, during which it lay on its side for about 30 seconds.&lt;ref name=Satori&gt;{{cite web|title=Satori - Perfect Storm|url=http://www.westsail.org/satoristorm|publisher=Westsail Owners Association|accessdate=1 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to requests by the crew, Captain Ray Leonard permitted the two crewmembers to make a position report over radio, during which they made an unauthorized Mayday call. One of those crewmembers reported that she was so convinced that she was going to die that she wrote her name down and put it into a plastic bag so that her body could be identified when it was finally found.

There is controversy over whether the Captain was drunk, as charged by the women in the book, with Leonard objecting to this characterization.  Out of compassion for the expected loss of his boat, the Coast Guard did not test his blood alcohol levels at the time.  The Coast Guard declared the voyage manifestly unsafe and ordered everyone off-board, including the unwilling skipper.&lt;ref name=Satori /&gt; The Coast Guard first tried to take them on board via an inflatable boat, but after it was damaged when trying to approach ''Satori'' they sent a helicopter, which is a much riskier approach, as a rescue swimmer must jump into dangerous seas. The Coast Guard helicopter did not try to lower rescue gear onto the yacht (as shown in the movie, where it gets entangled with the mast), but rather asked the crew of ''Satori'' to jump overboard to meet a rescue swimmer in the water. Leonard eventually complied with the request.

After the storm, Leonard searched for the "Satori", hoping to find her still afloat, but in spite of his attempts she was found a few days later washed ashore on a Maryland beach, a bag of personal belongings still on deck. Leonard paid for a 60-foot fishing vessel to drag her off the beach, helped by a channel dug by Park Rangers who had been guarding the boat. He continued to sail the boat until 2000, and she remained in use with a new owner {{As of|2000|5|lc=y}}.&lt;ref name=Satori /&gt;

== Reception ==
''The Perfect Storm'' received mixed reviews from critics, with a 47% approval rating on critic site [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with a consensus of, "While the special effects are well done and quite impressive, this film suffers a lack of any actual drama or characterization. The end result is a film that offers nifty eye-candy and nothing else."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/perfect_storm/ The Perfect Storm on RT]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Perfect Storm'' was a box office success. On its opening weekend, it debuted with $42 million ahead of Sony's ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'' and eventually brought in over $182.6 million in the United States, and $146.1 million around the world to a total of $328.7 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=perfectstorm.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was nominated for 2 [[Academy Awards]], Best Visual Effects ([[Walt Conti]], [[Stefen Fangmeier]], [[John Frazier]] and [[Habib Zargarpour]]) and Best Sound ([[John T. Reitz]], [[Gregg Rudloff]], [[David E. Campbell (sound engineer)|David E. Campbell]] and [[Keith A. Wester]]), but lost both to ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]''.&lt;ref name="Oscars2001"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/73rd-winners.html |title=The 73rd Academy Awards (2001) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-11-19|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==

After the film was released, the families of two crew members sued the film makers for the fictionalization of events which happened prior to the loss of ''Andrea Gail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/01/12/TampaBay/Court_revives__Perfec.shtml |title=Court Revives 'Perfect Storm' Lawsuit |publisher=St. Petersburg Times Online |accessdate=2010-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the [[Florida Supreme Court]] ruled against the family of Captain Tyne by a 6–2 vote. Some unnamed families also sued the producers in [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida|federal district court]], claiming that their names were used without their permission, and that facts were changed.&lt;ref name="ccase"&gt;{{cite news|last=Unger|first=Howard M.|title=Judge sinks 'Perfect Storm' lawsuit|publisher=Sarasota Herald Tribune|date=2002-05-31|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2074/perfectstorm.html|accessdate=2007-11-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207152811/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2074/perfectstorm.html|archivedate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district court, which is also located in Florida, dismissed the case, as in their opinion the defendants' [[First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]] barred the suit. The plaintiffs appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit]], which could not decide how to interpret the Florida law at issue and certified the question to the Florida Supreme Court. In the end, the Florida Supreme Court upheld the district court's interpretation of Florida law, and remanded the case to the 11th Circuit, which affirmed the prior decision to dismiss the case.&lt;ref name="ccase"/&gt;

'''''The Three Musicians''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Diego Velázquez]] (1599-1660),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsbestpaintings.net/artistsandpaintings/artist/59/|title=Diego Velázquez|publisher=www.worldsbestpaintings.net|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsbestpaintings.net/artistsandpaintings/artist/59/|title=Velázquez|publisher=www.worldsbestpaintings.net|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Spanish Baroque painter considered one of the great Spanish [[Realism (visual art)|naturalists]]. It depicts three young men grouped around a dinner table playing music. It is painted in [[chiaroscuro]], a Baroque painting technique that made use of the contrast between light and dark shadows to achieve a sense of volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-painting-gallery.com/BigPic.asp?id=717|title=The Three Musicians|publisher=art-painting-gallery.|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/u/0/asset-viewer/the-three-musicians/VgG9uyYlMjQ8DQ?hl=en|title=The Three Musicians |publisher=Google Art Institute|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
''The Three Musicians'' is one of Velázquez's earliest works, from his early [[Seville]] period. It is one of approximately ten paintings in the [[bodegón]] style that Velázquez created before 1622, while living in Seville. Its subject is similar to that of another painting, ''[[The Farmers' Lunch]]''. In this painting three young men are grouped around a table eating, drinking and playing music, with strong contrasts of light and darkness around the figures. The light falls from the left, creating sharp shadows and intense highlights. Two men with stringed instruments are singing while the third, the youngest, has an instrument of his own under his arm and a glass of wine in his hand; he displays the glass with a mocking smile, pointing out the wine that inspires the musicians. In the background can be seen a monkey with a pear in hand. The monkey emphasizes the grotesque nature of the scene.

A loaf of bread on a napkin, a glass of wine, and a piece of cheese with a knife stuck into it give Velázquez the opportunity to study the different textures. An interesting feature of ''The Three Musicians'' is the variety of issues raised, such as whether it is a [[genre painting|genre representation]] or whether behind the supposedly everyday scene there are hidden layers of meaning, which can make the picture readable as an allegory, giving it a different interpretation.&lt;ref name=Google /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-painting-gallery.com/BigPic.asp?id=717|title=The Three Musicians|publisher=art-painting-gallery.|accessdate=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Untouchables''''' is an American crime drama that ran from 1959 to 1963 on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Television Network, produced by [[Desilu Productions]]. Based on the [[The Untouchables (1957 book)|memoir of the same name]] by [[Eliot Ness]] and [[Oscar Fraley]], it fictionalized Ness's experiences as a [[Bureau of Prohibition|Prohibition agent]], fighting crime in Chicago in the 1930s with the help of a special team of agents handpicked for their courage, moral character, and incorruptibility, nicknamed [[the Untouchables (law enforcement)|the Untouchables]]. The book was later made into a film in 1987 (also called ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'') by [[Brian De Palma]], with a script by [[David Mamet]], and a second, less-successful [[The Untouchables (1993 TV series)|TV series]] in 1993.

A dynamic, hard-hitting action drama, and a landmark television crime series, ''The Untouchables'' won series star [[Robert Stack]] an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series|Best Actor in a Dramatic Series]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/robert-stack/biography.html |title=Robert Stack |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=2015-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018143452/https://movies.yahoo.com/person/robert-stack/biography.html |archivedate=October 18, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series originally focused on the efforts of a real-life squad of [[Prohibition]] agents employed by the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] and led by Eliot Ness (Stack), that helped bring down the bootleg empire of "Scarface" Al Capone, as described in Ness's bestselling 1957 memoir.  This squad was nicknamed "The Untouchables", because of their courage and honesty; they could not be bribed or intimidated by the Mob.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2DY0Ix4_Qk4C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq=The+Untouchables+could+not+be+bribed+or+intimidated+by+the+Mob.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_XQXctDAS2&amp;sig=SFLWgQZ6SOj2jV1hhKsNqwfTMcE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5WydUsLmB4_aoASbmYKQBw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Untouchables%20could%20not%20be%20bribed%20or%20intimidated%20by%20the%20Mob.&amp;f=false |title=The Everything Mafia Book: True Life Accounts of Legendary Figures, Infamous ... |author=James Mannion |page=47 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netplaces.com/mafia/the-real-untouchables/the-taxman-cometh.htm |title=About.com |publisher=Netplaces.com |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=2015-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413075058/http://www.netplaces.com/mafia/the-real-untouchables/the-taxman-cometh.htm |archive-date=April 13, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eliot Ness himself had died suddenly in May 1957, shortly before his memoir and the subsequent TV adaptation were to bring him fame beyond any he experienced in his lifetime.

The pilot for the series was a two-part episode entitled "The Untouchables" originally aired on [[CBS]]'s ''[[Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse]]'' on April 20 and 27, 1959.  Later retitled "The Scarface Mob", these episodes, which featured [[Neville Brand]] as Al Capone, were the only episodes in the series to be more-or-less directly based on Ness's memoir, and ended with the conviction and imprisonment of Capone. CBS, which had broadcast most of Desilu's television output since 1951 beginning with ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', was offered the new series following the success of the pilot film. Chairman [[William S. Paley]] rejected it on the advice of network vice president Hubbell Robinson. ABC agreed to air the series, and ''The Untouchables'' premiered on October 15, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebhc.org/publications/BEHprint/v012/p0056-p0073.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922235834/http://www.thebhc.org/publications/BEHprint/v012/p0056-p0073.pdf |date=September 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the pilot movie, the mobsters generally spoke with unrealistic pseudo-Italian accents, but this idiosyncratic pronunciation was dropped when the series debuted.

The weekly series first followed the premise of a power struggle to establish a new boss in Capone's absence (for the purpose of the TV series, the new boss was [[Frank Nitti]], although this was contrary to fact). As the series continued, there developed a highly fictionalized portrayal of Ness and his crew as all-purpose crime fighters who went up against an array of gangsters and villains of the 1930s, including [[Ma Barker]], [[Dutch Schultz]], [[Bugs Moran]], [[Vincent "Mad Dog" Coll]], [[Legs Diamond]], [[Lucky Luciano]], and in one episode, [[Nazi]] agents.

The terse narration by gossip columnist [[Walter Winchell]], in his distinctive New York accent, was a stylistic hallmark of the series, along with its melancholy theme music by [[Nelson Riddle]] and its shadowy black-and-white photography, influenced by [[film noir]].

===Controversy===
[[File:Robert Stack Untouchables 1962.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Stack as Eliot Ness with [[Gloria Talbott]], 1962]]
The show drew harsh criticism from some Italian-Americans, including [[Frank Sinatra]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Gay Talese|Talese, Gay]]: "[[Frank Sinatra Has a Cold]]", page 27. [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]], April 1966&lt;/ref&gt; who felt it promoted negative stereotypes of them as mobsters and gangsters. The Capone family unsuccessfully sued CBS, Desilu Productions, and Westinghouse Electric Corporation for their depiction of the Capone family. In the first episode of the first season, the character of "Agent (Rico) Rossi", a person of Italian extraction who had witnessed a gangland murder, was added to Ness's team.

On March 9, 1961, [[Anthony Anastasio]], chief of the Brooklyn waterfront and its [[International Longshoremen's Association]], marched in line with a picket group who identified themselves as "The Federation of Italian-American Democratic Organizations". In protest formation outside the ABC New York headquarters, they had come together to urge the public boycott of [[Liggett Group|Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company]] (L&amp;M) products, including Chesterfield King cigarettes, the lead sponsor of ''The Untouchables''. They expressed displeasure with the program, which to them vilified Italian-Americans, stereotyping them as the singular criminal element.  The boycott and the attendant firestorm of publicity had the effect Anastasio and his confederates wanted.  Four days after the picket of ABC, L&amp;M, denying it had bowed to intimidation, announced it would drop its sponsorship of ''The Untouchables'', maintaining the decision was based on network-scheduling conflicts.  The following week, the head of [[Desilu]], [[Desi Arnaz]] (who had attended high school with Capone's son [[Albert Francis Capone|Albert]]), in concert with ABC and the "[[Italian-American Civil Rights League|Italian-American League to Combat Defamation]]", issued a formal three-point manifesto:

* There will be no more fictional hoodlums with Italian names in future productions.
* There will be more stress on the law-enforcement role of "Rico Rossi", Ness's right-hand man on the show.
* There will be an emphasis on the "formidable influence" of Italian-American officials in reducing crime and an emphasis on the "great contributions" made to American culture by Americans of Italian descent.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Jay S., in association with the editors of ''TV Guide'', "''TV Guide: The First 25 Years,''"  Simon &amp; Schuster, 1978, p. 52-53, {{ISBN|0-671-23065-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series also incurred the displeasure of the powerful director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[J. Edgar Hoover]], when the fictionalized scripts depicted Ness and his Treasury agents involved in operations that were actually the province of the FBI.  The second episode of the series, for example, depicted Ness and his crew involved in the capture of the Ma Barker gang, an incident in which the real-life Ness played no part.  The producers agreed to insert a spoken disclaimer on future broadcasts of the episode stating that the FBI had primary responsibility for the Barker case.

''The Untouchables'' was an unusually violent program for its time and its excessive violence and surprisingly frank depictions of drug abuse and prostitution were described by the National Association for Better Radio and Television as "not fit for the television screen".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20151004213035/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tgAjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=K80FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=901,2668583&amp;dq=] &lt;/ref&gt;

In an article titled "The New Enemies of 'The Untouchables'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ayn Rand |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_nonfiction_the_ayn_rand_column |title=The Ayn Rand Column |publisher=AynRand.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ayn Rand]] argued that the persistent, superficial attacks received by ''The Untouchables'' were due to its appeal and its virtues: its moral conflict and moral purpose.

===Episodes and cast===
[[File:The Untouchables cast 1961.JPG|180px|thumb|The cast from left: Abel Fernandez, Nicholas Georgiade, Paul Picerni, (seated) Robert Stack (not shown: Steve London)]]
[[File:Neville Brand as Al Capone The Untouchables 1959.JPG|thumb|180px|Neville Brand as Al Capone]]
The series had 118 episodes which ran 50 minutes each.  Though the book chronicled the experiences of Ness and his cohorts against Capone, and in reality the Untouchables disbanded soon after Capone's conviction, the series continued after the pilot and book ended, depicting the fictitious further exploits of the Untouchables against many, often real life, criminals over a span of time ranging from 1929 to 1935. The television episodes were broadcast in no chronological timeline, but were set mostly in the early 1930s (for example, one episode, "You Can't Pick the Number", begins with Winchell's words, "October 1932: the depth of the [[Great Depression|Depression]]"). A few episodes were set primarily in a locale other than Chicago (such as the one dealing with the shootout involving Ma Barker and her gang.) Characters and "facts" in the majority of the episodes were more often than not entirely fictitious or loosely based composites of true-life criminals of that era. The gripping theme music was by Nelson Riddle.

[[Quinn Martin]] produced the show's first season, which contained elements that could be found in future TV series produced by Martin.&lt;ref&gt;Etter, Jonathan.  ''Quinn Martin, Producer''.  Jefferson:  McFarland, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent Untouchables were portrayed by:
*[[Robert Stack]] as Agent [[Eliot Ness]]
*[[Abel Fernandez]] as Agent William Youngfellow
*[[Nicholas Georgiade]] as Agent Enrico "Rico" Rossi
*[[Paul Picerni]] as Agent Lee Hobson, (second season on)
*[[Steve London]] as Agent Jack Rossman (portrayed in the pilot by [[Paul Dubov]])

Other Untouchables members who were prominent at first, but didn't last past the pilot or the first season, were portrayed by :

*[[Jerry Paris]] as Agent Martin Flaherty, (first season only-portrayed in the pilot by [[Bill Williams (actor)|Bill Williams]])
*Chuck Hicks as Agent LaMarr Kane (first season only-portrayed in the pilot by [[Peter Leeds]])
*[[Anthony George]] as Agent Cam Allison, (first season only)
*[[Keenan Wynn]] as Agent Joe Fuselli (pilot episode only)
*[[Eddie Firestone]] as Agent Eric Hansen (pilot episode only)
*[[Robert Osterloh]] as Agent Tom Kopka (pilot episode only)

In addition to the Untouchables themselves, there were several recurring allies in more than one episode:
*[[Frank Wilcox]] as Federal District Attorney Beecher Asbury
*[[Robert Bice]] as Police Capt. Johnson
*[[Jason Wingreen]] as Police Capt. Dorset
*[[Raymond Bailey]] as US Attorney for New York John Carvell
*[[Barbara Nichols]] as Brandy La France, showgirl and wife/widow of an informant, appearing in both the pilot and premiere
*[[Dane Clark]] as Dr. Victor Garr
*[[John Gabriel (actor)|John Gabriel]] as Dr. Daniel Gilford
*[[Barbara Stanwyck]] as Lt. Agatha Stewart, head of the Missing Persons Bureau
*[[Ed Asner]] as Frank, one of Agatha Stewart's assistants
*[[Virginia Capers]] as June, one of Agatha Stewart's assistants

The show also had several recurrent gangsters, many of them loosely based on real life gangsters of the time period:

*[[Frank Nitti]], Capone's enforcer who takes over the Chicago mob after Capone is imprisoned, portrayed by [[Bruce Gordon (actor)|Bruce Gordon]], and appearing in far more episodes than any other gangster
*Joe Kulak, portrayed by [[Oscar Beregi, Jr.]]
*[[Dutch Schultz]], portrayed in different episodes by [[Lawrence Dobkin]], [[Robert J. Wilke]], and [[Warren J. Kemmerling]]
*[[Jake Guzik|Jake "Greasy Thumb" Guzik]], portrayed in the pilot by [[Bern Hoffman]], and in the series by [[Nehemiah Persoff]]
*[[George "Bugs" Moran]], portrayed in different episodes by [[Lloyd Nolan]], Robert J. Wilke, and [[Harry Morgan]]
*[[Louis Lepke Buchalter]], portrayed in different episodes by [[Gene Roth]], [[Robert Carricart]], and [[Joseph Ruskin]]
*[[Lucky Luciano]], portrayed by Robert Carricart
*Pete Konitz, portrayed by [[Carl Milletaire]]
*Frankie Resko, portrayed by [[Grant Richards]]
*[[Al Capone]], portrayed by [[Neville Brand]], and appearing only in the 2 hour pilot and a 2 part episode
*[[Louis Campagna]], portrayed by [[Frank Dekova]]
*Augie Viale, portrayed by [[John Beradino]]
*Little Charlie Sebastino, portrayed by [[Henry Silva]]
*Louis Latito, portrayed by [[Joe De Santis]]
*Archie Devlin, Capone's attorney, portrayed by [[George N. Neise]]
*Lucky Quinn, portrayed by [[John Kellogg (actor)|John Kellogg]]
*[[Joe Aiello]] portrayed in different episodes by [[H. M. Wynant]] and Grant Richards
*Phil D'Andrea, portrayed by [[Wally Cassell]], and appearing only in the pilot and premiere
*"Fur" Sammons, portrayed by [[Richard Benedict]], and appearing only in the pilot and premiere
*Tony "Mops" Volpe, portrayed by [[Herman Rudin]], and appearing only in the pilot and premiere

Finally, heard in every episode, but never shown onscreen:

*Announcer: Les Lampson
*Narrator: [[Walter Winchell]]

Paul Picerni and Nicholas Georgiade were cast as gangsters in Capone and Nitti's mob in the 1959 pilot before being cast in the series.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Steve London's character of Untouchable Jack Rossman (played in the "Scarface Mob" pilot by [[Paul Dubov]]),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0239532/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056449/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm&lt;/ref&gt; was in the series since the original season-one series episode, "The Empty Chair", not from season two on as is commonly reported.
&lt;/small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; The character of Untouchable William Youngfellow, portrayed by Abel Fernandez, has been mistakenly referred to by ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' actor [[Dan Aykroyd]] as "Youngblood". This name is incorrect.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75nuntouchables.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Desi Arnaz: 02/21/76: The Untouchables |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date=February 21, 1936 |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast history==
''The Untouchables'' originally aired as a segment of the anthology series ''Desilu Playhouse'' in 1959.  It was picked up as a regular series by ABC for the 1959 season and was aired on Thursdays from 9:30 to 10:30pm from 1959 to 1962, switching to Tuesday evenings from 9:30 to 10:30pm for its final season (1962-63).

Desilu Productions president Desi Arnaz had originally offered the role of Ness to [[Van Johnson]]. Johnson's wife and manager rejected the deal, and demanded double the salary offer. Arnaz refused and signed Stack, instead. Arnaz had had a long business relationship with CBS, which had aired many Desilu programs, including ''I Love Lucy'' and ''[[The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour]]''.  When CBS refused to buy the program, Arnaz sold it to ABC.&lt;ref&gt;Warren G. Harris 'Lucy &amp; Desi'&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Neville Brand reprised his role as Al Capone in the movie ''The [[George Raft]] Story''.

Some segments were released to theaters as movies: ''The Scarface Mob'' (from the two-part pilot), ''The [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz]] Express'' (from "The Big Train"), and ''The Gun of Zangara'' (from "Unhired Assassin").

On November 10, 1991, NBC ran the two-hour movie ''The Return of Eliot Ness'', with Robert Stack as Ness. It was set in 1947, after Capone's death, and depicted Ness investigating the death of an Untouchables agent named Labine.

==Legacy==

''The Untouchables'' was a landmark television series, that has spawned numerous imitators over the decades, such as ''[[S.W.A.T. (1975 TV series)|S.W.A.T.]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culttvstore.com/index.php/information/series-formats-v15-27/item/206-crime-story |title=Crime Story |publisher=Culttvstore.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the original ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (Five-O's creator and executive producer, [[Leonard Freeman]], served as executive producer on ''The Untouchables{{'}}'' final season), Robert Stack's two later series, ''[[Strike Force (TV series)|Strike Force]]'' and ''[[Most Wanted (1976 TV series)|Most Wanted]]'', ''[[The Hat Squad]]'', and the 1993 [[The Untouchables (1993 TV series)|''The Untouchables'' syndicated TV series]].

It also inspired the big-budget motion pictures ''[[Al Capone (film)|Al Capone]]'' starring [[Rod Steiger]], ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (with [[Kevin Costner]]), ''[[Gangster Squad (film)|Gangster Squad]]'', ''[[Mulholland Falls]]'', and others.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
''The Untouchables'' is one of two series from 1959, the other being ''[[The Detectives (1959 TV series)|The Detectives]]'', together credited with the concept of depicting a ''group'' of crime fighters.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Previously, most TV crime dramas had followed one of two formats: either a duo composed of a stalwart police officer or detective and his trusty sidekick/partner (''Dragnet'', ''The Lineup''), or a lone-wolf [[private investigator|private eye]] or police detective (''Peter Gunn'', ''Richard Diamond'', ''M-Squad'').

The series was spoofed in the 1963 [[Merrie Melodies]] cartoon short "[[The Unmentionables]]", with [[Bugs Bunny]] playing the role of Elegant Mess, a crime fighter who is assigned to infiltrate a black market ring operated by [[Rocky and Mugsy]]. The series was also spoofed on an episode of the 1961-62 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]/[[Hanna Barbara]] cartoon series ''[[Top Cat]]'' entitled "The Unscratchables". NBC's ''"Saturday Night Live"'' spoofed The Untouchables several times during the 1970s, with [[Dan Aykroyd]] playing Eliot Ness.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_912eS5WV7w&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 1988 book, ''The Critics' Choice—The Best of Crime and Detective TV'', authors [[Max Allan Collins]] and John Javna chose ''The Untouchables'' as one of the "Top 10 Best Police TV Series (Police Procedurals) of All Time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Best of Crime &amp; Detective Tv the Critics' Choice|author1=Max Allan Collins|author2=John Javna|isbn=0-517-57055-6|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Best-Crime-Detective-Critics-Choice/dp/0517570556/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1390750916&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+best+of+crime+and+detective+tv |title=The Best of Crime &amp; Detective TV (The Critics' Choice) |author1=Max Allan Collins |author2=John Javna |isbn=9780517570555 |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lebanon (Pa.) ''Daily News'' said of ''The Untouchables'': "Between the hard-nosed approach, sharp dialogue, and a commendably crisp pace (something rare in dramatic TV at the time), this series is one of the few that remains fresh and vibrant. Only the [[monochrome]] presentation betrays its age. ''The Untouchables'' is one of the few Golden Age TV shows that deserves being called a classic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Long |first=Harry H. |url=http://www.ldnews.com/ci_21273752/from-reel-disc-gunsmoke-simplistic-tale-good-versus |title=From Reel to Disc: 'Gunsmoke' simplistic tale of good versus evil – Lebanon Daily News |publisher=Ldnews.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018143452/http://www.ldnews.com/ci_21273752/from-reel-disc-gunsmoke-simplistic-tale-good-versus |archivedate=October 18, 2015 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{Nihongo|'''Tōdōza'''|当道座}} was a [[Japan]]ese guild for blind men, established in the 14th century by the [[biwa hōshi]] {{Nihongo|[[Akashi Kakuichi]]|明石覚一}}.  Members performed a variety of roles, as itinerant musicians, [[massage|masseurs]], and [[acupuncture|acupuncturists]].  It received the patronage of the [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] and [[Edo period|Edo]] shogunates, and remained active until the [[Meiji restoration]], being eventually disbanded in 1871.

The organization was hierarchically structured.  The primary ranks, known as {{Nihongo|''mōkan''|盲官|blind officers}}, were {{Nihongo|Kengyō|検校}} (the highest), then {{Nihongo|Bettō|別当}}, {{Nihongo|Kōtō|勾当}}, and {{Nihongo|Zatō|座頭}}; these were further subdivided into a total of 73 distinct grades.  Total membership was usually around 3,000; it is not known what proportion of the total blind population this represents.

The Tōdōza accepted only male members; a separate organization, the {{Nihongo|''Gozeza''|瞽女座}}, existed for blind women. There was additionally a further guild, the {{Nihongo|''Mōsōza''|盲僧座}}, similar to the Tōdōza but active mostly in the western regions of Japan.
