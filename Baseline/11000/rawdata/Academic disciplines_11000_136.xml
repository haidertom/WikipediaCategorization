      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2025">'''Saints Antonina and Alexander''' were [[Christianity|Christian]] [[martyr]]s of 313, and they are [[saint]]s whose ''acta'' are legendary.  The story of the two is nearly identical to that of [[Saints Theodora and Didymus]].

[[Diocletian]], in order to increase the number of native-born [[ancient Rome|Roman]] citizens, defined as crime intentional [[celibacy]] among women. All Roman women of suitable age were commanded to marry and, if possible, produce children. At the same time, Diocletian persecuted Christians.  The legend of Antonina and Alexander has the former being forced to a [[brothel]] (the penalty for women who refused to wed), where a Christian soldier named Alexander came to her in the guise of a customer. Instead of deflowering her, he traded clothes with her, allowing Antonina to escape. Alexander was discovered very soon after, and both Antonina and Alexander were executed by being burned alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Martyrologium Romanum|publisher = Gregory XIII, Pope|year = 1914|isbn = 9781497350298|page = 127|trans-title = The Roman Martyrology|chapter = Quarto die Maii|trans-chapter = The Fourth Day of May|orig-year = 1749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Antonina" and "Alexander" may be mnemonic device names that made oral repetition of the tale easier, and so it is possible, if not likely, that they are invented names.  Whether Theodora and Didymus were the originals or not, it is possible that these legends are shadows of an actual martyrdom that had been lost to the story tellers. The [[feast day]] of Antonina and Alexander in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is May 3.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5305">{{About| the application of philosophical ontology |the term in computer science|ontology (computer science)}}

'''Applied ontology''' involves the practical application of [[ontological]] resources to specific domains, such as [[management]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], [[biomedicine]] or [[geography]]. Much work in applied ontology is carried out within the framework of the [[semantic web]].

==Applying ontology to relationships==
The challenge of applying ontology is ontology's emphasis on a [[world view]] [[orthogonal]] to [[epistemology]].  The emphasis is on being rather than on doing (as implied by "[[applied science|applied]]") or on [[knowledge|knowing]].  This is explored by philosophers and pragmatists like [[Fernando Flores]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

One way in which that emphasis plays out is in the concept of "[[speech acts]]": acts of promising, ordering, apologizing, requesting, inviting or sharing.  The study of these acts from an ontological perspective is one of the driving forces behind relationship-oriented applied ontology.&lt;ref&gt;

 | quote = Talk all you want to, Flores says, but if you want to act powerfully, you need to master 'speech acts': language rituals that build trust between colleagues and customers, word practices that open your eyes to new possibilities. Speech acts are powerful because most of the actions that people engage in -- in business, in marriage, in parenting -- are carried out through conversation.
 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; This can involve concepts championed by [[Ordinary-language philosophy|ordinary language]] philosophers like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

Applying ontology can also involve looking at the relationship between a person's world and that person's actions.  The context or [[Heideggerian terminology#Clearing|clearing]] is highly influenced by the being of the subject or the field of [[Category of being|being]] itself.  This view is highly influenced by the philosophy of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/ |title=Phenomenology |date=2013-12-16 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the works of Heidegger, and others.&lt;ref&gt;

==Ontological perspectives==
Social scientists adopt a number of ontological approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raddon|first1=Arwen|title=Epistemology &amp; Ontology in Social Science Research|url=https://www2.le.ac.uk/colleges/ssah/documents/research-training-presentations/EpistFeb10.pdf|website=le.ac.uk/|publisher=University of Leicster|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Methodology: Ontology|url=https://research-methodology.net/research-philosophy/ontology/|website=Research Methodologies|publisher=research-methodology.net|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Scientific realism|Realism]] - the idea that facts are "out there" just waiting to be discovered;
# [[Empiricism]] - the idea that we can observe the world and evaluate those observations in relation to facts;
# [[Positivism]] - which focuses on the observations themselves, attentive more to claims about facts than to facts themselves;
# [[Grounded theory]] - which claims to derive theories from facts;
# [[Engaged theory]] - which moves across different levels of interpretation, linking different empirical questions to ontological understandings;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= James | first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In —Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | year= 2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Postmodernism]] - which regards facts as fluid and elusive, and recommends focusing only on observational claims.

'''Arslan Eyce Private Amphora Museum''', also known as '''Taşucu Amphora Museum''', ({{lang-tr|Arslan Eyce Özel Amphora Müzesi}}) is a [[maritime archaeology]] museum dedicated to [[amphora]] in [[Taşucu]], southern Turkey.

Taşucu, known as Holmi in the antiquity, at {{coord|36|19|03|N|33|52|40|E}} is a seaside town in [[Silifke]] İlçe (district) of [[Mersin Province]]. Formerly, it was an important port. The museum is located in an 18th-century building on the İsmet İnönü Boulevard, which was originally a storage building. The building now is a property of the museum foundation. Arslan Eyce, a citizen of Silifke, spent 40 years in collecting ancient amphorae mostly from shipwrecks. In 1997, the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)]] took over the collection. After maintenance, the museum was officially opened in 2003.&lt;ref name="TU"&gt;[http://www.tasucuamphoramuzesi.com/tr/tasucu-arslan-eyce-amphora-muzesi/ Museum page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tam"/&gt;

There are 400 amphorae in the museum. The exhibited amphorae span a long time from 3200 BC to 1800 AD.&lt;ref name="TU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tam"/&gt;

'''Arthur Asa Berger''' (born 1933) is Professor Emeritus in Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts at [[San Francisco State University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sagepub.com/authorDetails.nav?contribId=501254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He received a "Catholic" education in his public high school despite the fact that he is Jewish. Most of his teachers were [[Catholics]] who were educated at [[Boston College]] or [[College of the Holy Cross]]. He gradually developed interest in writing and drawing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enculturation.net/writing-myself-into-existence&lt;/ref&gt;
He got a B.A. in literature and philosophy at the University of Massachusetts in 1954, assuming that a good education would fit him for any job. Then he applied to graduate school in journalism, thinking that he liked to write and might find journalism an interesting career. He was accepted into the [[University of California Berkeley]] journalism school and started there in the summer of 1954 but transferred to the University of Iowa where he could work with people like Marguerite Young. He was also able to take a couple of philosophy courses with [[Gustav Bergmann]] from the Vienna Circle. He was drafted in the summer of 1956, eleven days after he received his MA. He got out of the Army in 1958 and went to Europe for a year.

==Academic career==
[[File:پروفسور برگر.jpg|thumb|Arthur Asa Berger during a lecture at [[University of Tehran]] in May 2015]]
A year after he came back from Europe, he enrolled at the University of Minnesota’s program for a Ph.D in [[American Studies]]. In time, he ended up teaching in the Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts department at [[San Francisco State University]] where he taught courses on writing and media criticism. Berger has published more than 130 articles and more than 70 books in the course of his career.  He spent 1963-64 as a [[U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission|Fulbright]] scholar at the University of Milan and has also taught at Jinan University and Tsing Hua university in China, spent a month as a Fulbright Senior Specialist lecturing on semiotics in Argentina and lectured in more than a dozen universities in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ralon, L. (2012), Interview with Arthur Asa Berger Professor Emeritus Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts [[San Francisco State University]].The Popular Culture Studies Journal, Vol. 1, No. 1&amp;2,  126-137&lt;/ref&gt; His works have been cited thousands of times by international academics.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RPJrfN0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Berger is married to Philis Berger and they have two children. Their son Gabriel went to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] for his BA and has a Ph.D. in
mathematics from Columbia.  He works for Google now.  Their daughter Nina has a doctorate from an institute that trains psychoanalysts and is a psychoanalyst. [[Jason Berger]] was his brother. He manages his personal weblog named ''Decoder Man''.&lt;ref&gt;http://decoderman.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''aurora''' (plural: '''auroras''' or '''aurorae'''),{{efn|The name "auroras"  is now the more common plural of "aurora", however ''aurorae'' is the original Latin plural and is often used by scientists; in some contexts, aurora is an uncountable noun, multiple sightings being referred to as "the aurora".

Modern style guides recommend that the names of [[meteorological phenomena]], such as aurora borealis, be uncapitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |title=University of Minnesota Style Manual |publisher=.umn.edu |date=18 July 2007 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722101345/http://www1.umn.edu/urelate/style/sciterminology.html#Anchor-37516 |archivedate=22 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} sometimes referred to as '''polar lights''', '''northern lights''' (aurora borealis) or '''southern lights''' (aurora australis), is a natural light display in the Earth's sky, predominantly seen in the [[polar regions of Earth|high-latitude regions]] (around the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]]).

Auroras are produced when the [[magnetosphere]] is sufficiently disturbed by the [[solar wind]] that the trajectories of [[charged particle]]s in both solar wind and [[Van Allen belt|magnetospheric plasma]], mainly in the form of [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s, precipitate them into the upper atmosphere ([[thermosphere]]/[[exosphere]]) due to [[Earth's magnetic field]], where their energy is lost.

The resulting [[ionization]] and excitation of atmospheric constituents emits light of varying color and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles. Precipitating protons generally produce optical emissions as incident [[hydrogen]] atoms after gaining electrons from the atmosphere. Proton auroras are usually observed at lower latitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auspace.athabascau.ca/handle/2149/518 |title=Simultaneous ground and satellite observations of an isolated proton arc at sub-auroral latitudes |publisher=Journal of Geophysical Research |date=2007 |accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "aurora" comes from the Latin word for "dawn, morning light", since auroras were formerly thought to be the first light of dawn.

==Occurrence of terrestrial auroras==
Most auroras occur in a band known as the "auroral zone",&lt;ref name="feldstein86"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Feldstein |first=Y. I. |year=2011 |title=A Quarter Century with the Auroral Oval |journal=EOS |volume=67 |issue=40 |page=761 |doi=10.1029/EO067i040p00761-02 |bibcode=1986EOSTr..67..761F }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is typically 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the [[geomagnetic pole]]s at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently displays an aurora is called the "auroral oval", a band displaced towards the night side of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9gLwCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA190&amp;lpg=PA190&amp;dq=Occurrence+of+terrestrial+auroras#v=onepage&amp;q=Occurrence%20of%20terrestrial%20auroras|title=Illustrated Glossary for Solar and Solar-Terrestrial Physics|last=Bruzek|first=A.|last2=Durrant|first2=C. J.|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401012454|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence for a geomagnetic connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. [[Elias Loomis]] (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881)&lt;ref&gt;Fritz, Hermann (1881). "Das Polarlicht."&lt;/ref&gt; and S. Tromholt (1882)&lt;ref&gt;Tromholt, S. (1882) Om nordlysets perioder/Sur les périodes de l'aurore boréale, l'annuaire 1880, Inst. Météorol. Danois, Copenhagen.&lt;/ref&gt; in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone. Day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=SpaceWeather |url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=Current Auroral Oval |accessdate=19 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern [[latitude]]s, the effect is known as the aurora borealis or the northern lights. The former term was coined by [[Galileo]] in 1619, from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Aurora (mythology)|goddess of the dawn]] and the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the north wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1029/HG002p0011 |chapter=An historical footnote on the origin of 'aurora borealis' |title=History of Geophysics: Volume 2 |journal=History of Geophysics: Volume 2.

L. |isbn=978-0-87590-276-0|bibcode = 1986HGeo....2...11S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The southern counterpart, the aurora australis or the southern lights, has features  almost identical to the aurora borealis and changes simultaneously with changes in the northern auroral zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jastp.2006.05.026 |title=Auroral conjugacy studies based on global imaging |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=249 |year=2007 |last1=Østgaard |first1=N. |last2=Mende |first2=S.

M. |bibcode=2007JASTP..69..249O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aurora Australis is visible from high southern latitudes in [[Antarctica]], [[Chile]], [[Argentina]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]].

A [[geomagnetic storm]] causes the auroral ovals (north and south) to expand, and bring the aurora to lower latitudes. The instantaneous distribution of auroras ("auroral oval")&lt;ref name="feldstein86" /&gt; is slightly different, being centered about 3–5° nightward of the magnetic pole, so that auroral arcs reach furthest toward the equator when the [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic pole]] in question is in between the observer and the [[Sun]]. The aurora can be seen best at this time, which is called [[magnetic midnight]].

Auroras seen within the auroral oval may be directly overhead, but from farther away, they illuminate the poleward horizon as a greenish glow, or sometimes a faint red, as if the Sun were rising from an unusual direction. Auroras also occur poleward of the auroral zone as either diffuse patches or arcs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frey |first=H.

Auroras are occasionally seen in latitudes below the auroral zone, when a geomagnetic storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval. Large geomagnetic storms are most common during the peak of the 11-year [[sunspot|sunspot cycle]] or during the three years after the peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stamper |first1=J. |first2=M. |last2=Lockwood |first3=M.

An aurora may appear overhead as a "corona" of rays, radiating from a distant and apparent central location, which results from [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]].
An electron spirals (gyrates) about a field line at an angle that is determined by its velocity vectors, parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to the local geomagnetic field vector B. This angle is known as the "pitch angle" of the particle. The distance, or radius, of the electron from the field line at any time is known as its Larmor radius. The pitch angle increases as the electron travels to a region of greater field strength nearer to the atmosphere. Thus, it is possible for some particles to return, or mirror, if the angle becomes 90° before entering the atmosphere to collide with the denser molecules there. Other particles that do not mirror enter the atmosphere and contribute to the auroral display over a range of altitudes.
Other types of auroras have been observed from space, e.g."poleward arcs" stretching sunward across the polar cap, the related "theta aurora",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1029/2003GL017914 |title=Observations of non-conjugate theta aurora |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=30 |issue=21 |pages=2125 |year=2003 |last1=Østgaard |first1=N. |bibcode=2003GeoRL..30.2125O }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "dayside arcs" near noon. These are relatively infrequent and poorly understood. Other interesting effects occur such as flickering aurora, "black aurora" and subvisual red arcs. In addition to all these, a weak glow (often deep red) observed around the two polar cusps, the field lines separating the ones that close through the Earth from those that are swept into the tail and close remotely.

The altitudes where auroral emissions occur were revealed by Carl Størmer and his colleagues, who used cameras to triangulate more than 12,000 auroras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Størmer |first1=Carl |title=Frequency of 12,330 measured heights of aurora from southern Norway in the years 1911–1944 |journal=Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity |year=1946 |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=501–504 |doi=10.1029/te051i004p00501 |bibcode=1946TeMAE..51..501S }}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that most of the light is produced between 90 and 150&amp;nbsp;km above the ground, while extending at times to more than 1000&amp;nbsp;km.
Images of auroras are significantly more common today than in the past due to the increase in the use of [[digital camera]]s that have high enough sensitivities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=News and information about meteor showers, solar flares, auroras, and near-Earth asteroids |publisher=SpaceWeather.com |accessdate=5 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100804164127/http://spaceweather.com//| archivedate= 4 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film and digital exposure to auroral displays is fraught with difficulties. Due to the different color spectra present, and the temporal changes occurring during the exposure, the results are somewhat unpredictable. Different layers of the film emulsion respond differently to lower light levels, and choice of a film can be very important. Longer exposures superimpose rapidly changing features, and often blanket the dynamic attribute of a display. Higher sensitivity creates issues with graininess.

[[David Malin]] pioneered multiple exposure using multiple filters for astronomical photography, recombining the images in the laboratory to recreate the visual display more accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidmalin.com/index.html |title=Astronomical photographs from David Malin Images |publisher=davidmalin.com |accessdate=3 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For scientific research, proxies are often used, such as ultraviolet, and color-correction to simulate the appearance to humans. Predictive techniques are also used, to indicate the extent of the display, a highly useful tool for aurora hunters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/pmap/index.html |title=NOAA POES Auroral Activity |publisher=swpc.noaa.gov |accessdate=3 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728192250/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/pmap/index.html |archivedate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial features often find their way into aurora images, making them more accessible and more likely to be published by major websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceweather.com/ |title=What's up in space: Auroras Underfoot|publisher=SpaceWeather.com |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717093810/http://www.spaceweather.com/| archivedate= 17 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excellent images are possible with standard film (using [[Film speed|ISO ratings]] between 100 and 400) and a [[single-lens reflex camera]] with full [[aperture]], a fast lens (f1.4 50&amp;nbsp;mm, for example), and exposures between 10 and 30 seconds, depending on the aurora's brightness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceweather.com/aurora/images/24nov01/Moss1.jpg Aurora image] (JPG)&lt;/ref&gt;

Early work on the imaging of the auroras was done in 1949 by the [[University of Saskatchewan]] using the [[SCR-270]] radar.

===Visual forms and colors===
Auroras frequently appear either as a diffuse glow or as "curtains" that extend approximately in the east–west direction. At some times, they form "quiet arcs"; at others, they evolve and change constantly. These are called "active aurora".

The most distinctive and brightest are the curtain-like auroral arcs. Each curtain consists of many parallel rays, each lined up with the local direction of the magnetic field, consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. ''In situ'' particle measurements confirm that auroral electrons are guided by the geomagnetic field, and spiral around them while moving toward Earth. The similarity of an auroral display to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are the discrete auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00585-997-0943-z |title=Magnetospheric source region of discrete auroras inferred from their relationship with isotropy boundaries of energetic particles |journal=Annales Geophysicae |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=943 |year=1997 |last1=Yahnin |first1=A.

The diffuse aurora, though, is a relatively featureless glow sometimes close to the limit of visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6826(96)00113-7 |title=Polar cap arcs: A review |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=1087 |year=1997 |last1=Zhu |first1=L. |last2=Schunk |first2=R. W. |last3=Sojka |first3=J. J. |bibcode=1997JASTP..59.1087Z }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be distinguished from moonlit clouds because stars can be seen undiminished through the glow. Diffuse auroras are often composed of patches whose brightness exhibits regular or near-regular pulsations. The pulsation period can be typically many seconds, so is not always obvious. Often there black aurora i.e. narrow regions in diffuse aurora with reduced luminosity. A typical auroral display consists of these forms appearing in the above order throughout the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=A |first=Brekke |last2=A |first2=Egeland |title=The Northern Lights |date=1994 |publisher=Grøndahl and Dreyer, Oslo |isbn=978-82-504-2105-9 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Red''': At the highest altitudes, excited atomic oxygen emits at 630&amp;nbsp;nm (red); low concentration of atoms and lower sensitivity of eyes at this wavelength make this color visible only under more intense solar activity. The low number of oxygen atoms and their gradually diminishing concentration is responsible for the faint appearance of the top parts of the "curtains". Scarlet, crimson, and carmine are the most often-seen hues of red for the auroras.
* '''Green''': At lower altitudes, the more frequent collisions suppress the 630-nm (red) mode: rather the 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm emission (green) dominates. Fairly high concentration of atomic oxygen and higher eye sensitivity in green make green auroras the most common. The excited molecular nitrogen (atomic nitrogen being rare due to high stability of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule) plays a role here, as it can transfer energy by collision to an oxygen atom, which then radiates it away at the green wavelength. (Red and green can also mix together to produce pink or yellow hues.) The rapid decrease of concentration of atomic oxygen below about 100&amp;nbsp;km is responsible for the abrupt-looking end of the lower edges of the curtains. Both the 557.7 and 630.0&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths correspond to [[forbidden transition]]s of atomic oxygen, slow mechanism that is responsible for the graduality (0.7&amp;nbsp;s and 107&amp;nbsp;s respectively) of flaring and fading.
* '''Blue''': At yet lower altitudes, atomic oxygen is uncommon, and molecular nitrogen and ionized molecular nitrogen take over in producing visible light emission, radiating at a large number of wavelengths in both red and blue parts of the spectrum, with 428&amp;nbsp;nm (blue) being dominant. Blue and purple emissions, typically at the lower edges of the "curtains", show up at the highest levels of solar activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows to the Universe – Auroral colors and spectra|url=http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Magnetosphere/tour/tour_earth_magnetosphere_09.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular nitrogen transitions are much faster than the atomic oxygen ones.
* '''Ultraviolet''': Ultraviolet radiation from auroras (within the optical window but not visible to virtually all humans) has been observed with the requisite equipment. Ultraviolet auroras have also been seen on Mars,&lt;ref name="sci-news.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sci-news.com/space/science-nasas-maven-ultraviolet-aurora-mars-02614.html|title=NASA's MAVEN Orbiter Detects Ultraviolet Aurora on Mars &amp;#124; Space Exploration &amp;#124; Sci-News.com|publisher=sci-news.com|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter and Saturn.
* '''Infrared''': Infrared radiation, in wavelengths that are within the optical window, is also part of many auroras.&lt;ref name="sci-news.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dapep"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dapep.org/DAPT/EM-Wiki/aurora-borealis.html|title=Aurora Borealis|publisher=dapep.org|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Yellow''' and '''pink''' are [[Additive colour|a mix]] of red and green or blue. Other shades of red, as well as orange, may be seen on rare occasions; yellow-green is moderately common. As red, green, and blue are the primary colours of additive synthesis of colours, in theory, practically any colour might be possible, but the ones mentioned in this article comprise a virtually exhaustive list.

===Other auroral radiation===
In addition, the aurora and associated currents produce a strong radio emission around 150&amp;nbsp;kHz known as [[auroral kilometric radiation]] (AKR), discovered in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gurnett |first1=D.A. |title=The Earth as a radio source |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1974 |volume=79 |issue=79 |page=4227 |bibcode=1974JGR....79.4227G |doi=10.1029/JA079i028p04227 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ionospheric absorption makes AKR only observable from space.

Aurora [[noise]], similar to a hissing, or crackling noise, begins about {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the Earth's surface and is caused by charged particles in an [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] layer of the atmosphere formed during a cold night. The charged particles discharge when particles from the Sun hit the inversion layer, creating the noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/06/auroras-sounds-noises-explained-earth-space-astronomy|title=Auroras Make Weird Noises, and Now We Know Why|date=2016-06-27|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elec.aalto.fi/en/current/news/2016-06-22/|title=News: Acoustics researcher finds explanation for auroral sounds|date=2016-06-21|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes of auroras==
A full understanding of the physical processes which lead to different types of auroras is still incomplete, but the basic cause involves the interaction of the [[solar wind]] with the [[Earth's magnetosphere]]. The varying intensity of the solar wind produces effects of different magnitudes, but includes one or more of the following physical scenarios.
# A quiescent solar wind flowing past the Earth's magnetosphere steadily interacts with it and can both inject solar wind particles directly onto the geomagnetic field lines that are 'open', as opposed to being 'closed' in the opposite hemisphere, and provide diffusion through the [[bow shock]]. It can also cause particles already trapped in the [[Van Allen radiation belt|radiation belts]] to precipitate into the atmosphere. Once particles are lost to the atmosphere from the radiation belts, under quiet conditions new ones replace them only slowly, and the loss-cone becomes depleted. In the magnetotail, however, particle trajectories seem constantly to reshuffle, probably when the particles cross the very weak magnetic field near the equator. As a result, the flow of electrons in that region is nearly the same in all directions ("isotropic"), and assures a steady supply of leaking electrons. The leakage of electrons does not leave the tail positively charged, because each leaked electron lost to the atmosphere is replaced by a low energy electron drawn upward from the [[ionosphere]]. Such replacement of "hot" electrons by "cold" ones is in complete accord with the [[2nd law of thermodynamics]]. The complete process, which also generates an electric ring current around the Earth, is uncertain.
# Geomagnetic disturbance from an enhanced [[solar wind]] causes distortions of the [[magnetosphere|magnetotail]] ("magnetic substorms"). These 'substorms' tend to occur after prolonged spells (hours) during which the interplanetary magnetic field has had an appreciable southward component. This leads to a higher rate of interconnection between its field lines and those of Earth. As a result, the solar wind moves [[magnetic flux]] (tubes of magnetic field lines, 'locked' together with their resident plasma) from the day side of Earth to the magnetotail, widening the obstacle it presents to the solar wind flow and constricting the tail on the night-side. Ultimately some tail plasma can separate ("[[magnetic reconnection]]"); some blobs ("[[plasmoid]]s") are squeezed downstream and are carried away with the solar wind; others are squeezed toward Earth where their motion feeds strong outbursts of auroras, mainly around midnight ("unloading process"). A geomagnetic storm resulting from greater interaction adds many more particles to the plasma trapped around Earth, also producing enhancement of the "ring current". Occasionally the resulting modification of the Earth's magnetic field can be so strong that it produces auroras visible at middle latitudes, on field lines much closer to the equator than those of the auroral zone. 
#: [[File:Moon and Aurora.jpg|thumb|Moon and Aurora]]
# Acceleration of auroral charged particles invariably accompanies a magnetospheric disturbance that causes an aurora. This mechanism, which is believed to predominantly arise from strong electric fields along the magnetic field or wave-particle interactions, raises the velocity of a particle in the direction of the guiding magnetic field. The pitch angle is thereby decreased, and increases the chance of it being precipitated into the atmosphere. Both electromagnetic and electrostatic waves, produced at the time of greater geomagnetic disturbances, make a significant contribution to the energising processes that sustain an aurora. Particle acceleration provides a complex intermediate process for transferring energy from the solar wind indirectly into the atmosphere.

[[:Image:Aurora Australis.gif|An animation]] created using the same satellite data is also available]]
The details of these phenomena are not fully understood. However it is clear that the prime source of auroral particles is the solar wind feeding the magnetosphere, the reservoir containing the radiation zones, and temporarily magnetically trapped, particles confined by the geomagnetic field, coupled with particle acceleration processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burch |first1=J L |editor1-last=Akasofu S-I and Y Kamide |title=The solar wind and the Earth |date=1987 |publisher=D. Reidel |isbn=978-90-277-2471-7 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in 2016 more than fifty [[citizen science]] observations (under the aegis of Aurorasaurus) observed a heretofore unknown type of aurora which was dubbed "[[Steve (atmospheric phenomenon)|STEVE]]" (a reference to the animated film [[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]] in which one of the characters randomly names a previously unknown creature "Steve"); subsequent reportage went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]], and STEVE remains under active scientific investigation.&lt;ref name="STEVE"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blog.aurorasaurus.org/?p=449 |title=7 Things to Know About "STEVE" |date=2017-03-14 |website=Aurorasaurus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Auroral particles===
The immediate cause of the ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents leading to auroral emissions was discovered in 1960, when a pioneering rocket flight from Fort Churchill in Canada revealed a flux of electrons entering the atmosphere from above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McIlwain |first1=C E |title=Direct Measurement of Particles Producing Visible Auroras |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |year=1960 |volume=65 |issue=9 |page=2727 |doi=10.1029/JZ065i009p02727 |bibcode=1960JGR....65.2727M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then an extensive collection of measurements has been acquired painstakingly and with steadily improving resolution since the 1960s by many research teams using rockets and satellites to traverse the auroral zone. The main findings have been that auroral arcs and other bright forms are due to electrons that have been accelerated during the final few 10,000&amp;nbsp;km or so of their plunge into the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA093iA07p07441 |title=Determination of auroral electrostatic potentials using high- and low-altitude particle distributions |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=93 |issue=A7 |pages=7441 |year=1988 |last1=Reiff |first1=P.

A. |last8=Friedman |first8=M. A. |bibcode=1988JGR....93.7441R }}&lt;/ref&gt; These electrons often, but not always, exhibit a peak in their energy distribution, and are preferentially aligned along the local direction of the magnetic field.
Electrons mainly responsible for diffuse and pulsating auroras have, in contrast, a smoothly falling energy distribution, and an angular (pitch-angle) distribution favouring directions perpendicular to the local magnetic field. Pulsations were discovered to originate at or close to the equatorial crossing point of auroral zone magnetic field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/215045a0 |title=Evidence for Velocity Dispersion in Auroral Electrons |journal=Nature |volume=215 |issue=5096 |pages=45 |year=1967 |last1=Bryant |first1=D.

D. |bibcode=1967Natur.215...45B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protons are also associated with auroras, both discrete and diffuse.

=== Auroras and the atmosphere ===
Auroras result from emissions of [[photon]]s in the Earth's upper [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], above {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}}, from [[ionized]] [[nitrogen]] atoms regaining an electron, and [[oxygen]] atoms and [[nitrogen]] based molecules returning from an [[excited state]] to [[ground state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ultraviolet Waves|url=http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110127004149/http://missionscience.nasa.gov/ems/10_ultravioletwaves.html|archivedate=27 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are ionized or excited by the collision of particles precipitated into the atmosphere. Both incoming electrons and protons may be involved. Excitation energy is lost within the atmosphere by the emission of a photon, or by collision with another atom or molecule:
;[[oxygen]] emissions: green or orange-red, depending on the amount of energy absorbed.
;[[nitrogen]] emissions: blue or red; blue if the atom regains an electron after it has been ionized, red if returning to ground state from an excited state.&lt;!-- atoms? not molecules? --&gt;
Oxygen is unusual in terms of its return to ground state: it can take three quarters of a second to emit green light and up to two minutes to emit red. Collisions with other atoms or molecules absorb the excitation energy and prevent emission. Because the highest atmosphere has a higher percentage of oxygen and is sparsely distributed such collisions are rare enough to allow time for oxygen to emit red. Collisions become more frequent progressing down into the atmosphere, so that red emissions do not have time to happen, and eventually even green light emissions are prevented.
This is why there is a color differential with altitude; at high altitudes oxygen red dominates, then oxygen green and nitrogen blue/red, then finally nitrogen blue/red when collisions prevent oxygen from emitting anything. Green is the most common color. Then comes pink, a mixture of light green and red, followed by pure red, then yellow (a mixture of red and green), and finally, pure blue.

===Auroras and the ionosphere===
Bright auroras are generally associated with [[Birkeland current]]s (Schield et al., 1969;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA074i001p00247 |last1=Schield |first1=M. A. |last2=Freeman |first2=J. W. |last3=Dessler |first3=A. J. |year=1969 |title=A Source for Field-Aligned Currents at Auroral Latitudes |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=247–256 |bibcode=1969JGR....74..247S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zmuda and Armstrong, 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JA078i028p06802 |last1=Armstrong |first1=J. C. |last2=Zmuda |first2=A. J. |year=1973 |title=Triaxial magnetic measurements of field-aligned currents at 800 kilometers in the auroral region: Initial results |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research |volume=78 |issue=28 |pages=6802–6807 |bibcode=1973JGR....78.6802A}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which flow down into the ionosphere on one side of the pole and out on the other. In between, some of the current connects directly through the ionospheric E layer (125&amp;nbsp;km); the rest ("region 2") detours, leaving again through field lines closer to the equator and closing through the "partial ring current" carried by magnetically trapped plasma. The ionosphere is an [[Ohm's law|ohmic conductor]], so some consider that such currents require a driving voltage, which an, as yet unspecified, dynamo mechanism can supply. Electric field probes in orbit above the polar cap suggest voltages of the order of 40,000 volts, rising up to more than 200,000 volts during intense magnetic storms. In another interpretation the currents are the direct result of electron acceleration into the atmosphere by wave/particle interactions.

Ionospheric resistance has a complex nature, and leads to a secondary [[Hall current]] flow. By a strange twist of physics, the magnetic disturbance on the ground due to the main current almost cancels out, so most of the observed effect of auroras is due to a secondary current, the auroral [[electrojet]]. An auroral electrojet index (measured in nanotesla) is regularly derived from ground data and serves as a general measure of auroral activity. [[Kristian Birkeland]]&lt;ref name="NAPE"&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkeland |first=Kristian |title=The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902–1903 |date=1908 |publisher=H. Aschehoug &amp; Co. |location=New York: Christiania (Oslo) |page=720 |url=https://archive.org/details/norwegianaurorap01chririch}} out-of-print, full text online&lt;/ref&gt; deduced that the currents flowed in the east–west directions along the auroral arc, and such currents, flowing from the dayside toward (approximately) midnight were later named "auroral electrojets" (see also [[Birkeland current]]s).

==Interaction of the solar wind with Earth==
The Earth is constantly immersed in the [[solar wind]], a rarefied flow of hot plasma (a gas of free electrons and positive ions) emitted by the Sun in all directions, a result of the two-million-degree temperature of the Sun's outermost layer, the [[corona]]. The solar wind reaches Earth with a velocity typically around 400&amp;nbsp;km/s, a density of around 5 ions/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a magnetic field intensity of around 2–5 nT (for comparison, Earth's surface field is typically 30,000–50,000 nT). During [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storms]], in particular, flows can be several times faster; the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) may also be much stronger. [[Joan Feynman]] deduced in the 1970s that the long-term averages of solar wind speed correlated with geomagnetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19770051690|title=
On the high correlation between long-term averages of solar wind speed and geomagnetic activity|author1=Crooker, N. U. |author2=Feynman, J. |author3=Gosling, J. T. |date=1 May 1977|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her work resulted from data collected by the [[Explorer 33]] spacecraft.
The solar wind and magnetosphere consist of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] (ionized gas), which conducts electricity. It is well known (since [[Michael Faraday]]'s work around 1830) that when an electrical conductor is placed within a magnetic field while relative motion occurs in a direction that the conductor cuts ''across'' (or is cut ''by''), rather than ''along'', the lines of the magnetic field, an electric current is induced within the conductor. The strength of the current depends on a) the rate of relative motion, b) the strength of the magnetic field, c) the number of conductors ganged together and d) the distance between the conductor and the magnetic field, while the ''direction'' of flow is dependent upon the direction of relative motion. [[Dynamo]]s make use of this basic process ("the [[dynamo theory|dynamo effect]]"), any and all conductors, solid or otherwise are so affected, including plasmas and other fluids.
The IMF originates on the Sun, linked to the [[sunspot]]s, and its [[magnetism|field lines (lines of force)]] are dragged out by the solar wind. That alone would tend to line them up in the Sun-Earth direction, but the rotation of the Sun angles them at Earth by about 45 degrees forming a spiral in the ecliptic plane), known as the [[Eugene Parker|Parker spiral]]. The field lines passing Earth are therefore usually linked to those near the western edge ("limb") of the visible Sun at any time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html Alaska.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220050940/http://gse.gi.alaska.edu/recent/javascript_movie.html |date=20 December 2006 }}, Solar wind forecast from a [[University of Alaska]] website&lt;/ref&gt;
The solar wind and the magnetosphere, being two electrically conducting fluids in relative motion, should be able in principle to generate electric currents by dynamo action and impart energy from the flow of the solar wind. However, this process is hampered by the fact that plasmas conduct readily along magnetic field lines, but less readily perpendicular to them. Energy is more effectively transferred by temporary magnetic connection between the field lines of the solar wind and those of the magnetosphere. Unsurprisingly this process is known as [[magnetic reconnection]]. As already mentioned, it happens most readily when the interplanetary field is directed southward, in a similar direction to the geomagnetic field in the inner regions of both the [[north magnetic pole]] and [[south magnetic pole]].
[[Image:Structure of the magnetosphere-en.svg|thumb|Schematic of Earth's [[magnetosphere]]]]
Auroras are more frequent and brighter during the intense phase of the solar cycle when [[coronal mass ejections]] increase the intensity of the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050905165404/http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/aurora_worldbook.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 September 2005 |title=NASA – NASA and World Book |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetosphere===
Earth's [[magnetosphere]] is shaped by the impact of the solar wind on the Earth's magnetic field. This forms an obstacle to the flow, diverting it, at an average distance of about 70,000&amp;nbsp;km (11 Earth radii or Re),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shue |first1=J.-H |first2=J.

The width of the magnetosphere abreast of Earth, is typically 190,000&amp;nbsp;km (30 Re), and on the night side a long "magnetotail" of stretched field lines extends to great distances (&gt; 200 Re).
The high latitude magnetosphere is filled with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind. This flow is favoured by a southward component of the IMF, which can then directly connect to the high latitude geomagnetic field lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyons |first1=L. R. |first2=H.-J. |last2=Kim |first3=X. |last3=Xing |first4=S. |last4=Zou |first5=D.-Y. |last5=Lee |first6=C. |last6=Heinselman |first7=M.

In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.
On 26 February 2008, [[THEMIS]] probes were able to determine, for the first time, the triggering event for the onset of [[magnetospheric substorm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html |title=NASA – THEMIS Satellites Discover What Triggers Eruptions of the Northern Lights |publisher=Nasa.gov |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043044/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html| archivedate= 29 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the moon, measured events suggesting a [[magnetic reconnection]] event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1160495 |title=Tail Reconnection Triggering Substorm Onset |year=2008 |last1=Angelopoulos |first1=V. |last2=McFadden |first2=J.

[[Geomagnetic storm]]s that ignite auroras may occur more often during the months around the [[equinox]]es. It is not well understood, but geomagnetic storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to consider are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the geomagnetic pole rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the geomagnetic field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.

==Auroral particle acceleration==
The electrons responsible for the brightest forms of aurora are well accounted for by their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere. In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to the electrons due to their conservative nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bryant |first1=Duncan |title=Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond |date=1998 |publisher=Institute of Physics Publishing Ltd |location=Bristol &amp; Philadelphia |isbn=978-0750305334 |url=https://www.crcpress.com/Electron-Acceleration-in-the-Aurora-and-Beyond/Bryant/9780750305334 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrons and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.
The increase in strength of magnetic field lines towards the Earth creates a 'magnetic mirror' that turns back many of the downward flowing electrons. The bright forms of auroras are produced when downward acceleration not only increases the energy of precipitating electrons but also reduces their pitch angles (angle between electron velocity and the local magnetic field vector). This greatly increases the rate of deposition of energy into the atmosphere, and thereby the rates of ionisation, excitation and consequent emission of auroral light. Acceleration also increases the electron current flowing between the atmosphere and magnetosphere.

One early theory proposed for the acceleration of auroral electrons is based on an assumed static, or quasi-static, electric field creating a uni-directional potential drop.&lt;ref name="Evidence for the low altitude acceleration of auroral particles"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=D S |title=Hot Plasma in the Magnetosphere |date=1975 |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York and London |isbn=978-0306337000 |pages=319–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; No mention is provided of either the necessary space-charge or equi-potential distribution, and these remain to be specified for the notion of acceleration by double layers to be credible. Fundamentally, [[Poisson's equation]] indicates that there can be no configuration of charge resulting in a net potential drop.  Inexplicably though, some authors&lt;ref&gt;Boström, Rolf "Observations of weak double layers on auroral field lines" (1992) IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science ({{ISSN|0093-3813}}), vol. 20, no. 6, pp. 756–763&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ergun, R. E., et al. "Parallel electric fields in the upward current region of the aurora: Indirect and direct observations" (2002) Physics of Plasmas, Volume 9, Issue 9, pp. 3685–3694&lt;/ref&gt; still invoke quasi-static parallel electric fields as net accelerators of auroral electrons, citing interpretations of transient observations of fields and particles as supporting this theory as firm fact.  In another example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carlson |first1=C.W., R.F.Pfaff and J.G.Watzin |title=The Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST) mission |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |date=June 1998 |volume=25 |issue=12 |pages=2013–2016|bibcode = 1998GeoRL..25.2013C |doi = 10.1029/98GL01592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is little justification given for saying 'FAST observations demonstrate detailed quantitative agreement between the measured electric potentials and the '''ion beam''' energies...., leaving no doubt that parallel potential drops are a dominant source of '''auroral particle''' acceleration'.

Another theory is based on acceleration by Landau&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Landau_Lev.html|website=history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk |title=Lev Davidovich Landau}}&lt;/ref&gt; resonance in the turbulent electric fields of the acceleration region.

[[Image:Aurora Borealis.jpg|thumb|left|The aurora borealis as viewed from the International Space Station|ISS [[Expedition 6]] team, [[Lake Manicouagan]] is visible to the bottom left]]
Other mechanisms have also been proposed, in particular, [[Alfvén waves]], wave modes involving the magnetic field first noted by [[Hannes Alfvén]] (1942), which have been observed in the laboratory and in space. The question is whether these waves might just be a different way of looking at the above process, however, because this approach does not point out a different energy source, and many plasma bulk phenomena can also be described in terms of Alfvén waves.
{{Wikinews|Aurora Borealis caused by electrical space tornadoes}}
Other processes are also involved in the aurora, and much remains to be learned. Auroral electrons created by large geomagnetic storms often seem to have energies below 1 keV, and are stopped higher up, near 200&amp;nbsp;km. Such low energies excite mainly the red line of oxygen, so that often such auroras are red. On the other hand, positive ions also reach the ionosphere at such time, with energies of 20–30 keV, suggesting they might be an "overflow" along magnetic field lines of the copious "ring current" ions accelerated at such times, by processes different from the ones described above.
Some O+ ions ("conics") also seem accelerated in different ways by plasma processes associated with the aurora. These ions are accelerated by plasma waves in directions mainly perpendicular to the field lines. They therefore start at their "mirror points" and can travel only upward. As they do so, the "mirror effect" transforms their directions of motion, from perpendicular to the field line to a cone around it, which gradually narrows down, becoming increasingly parallel at large distances where the field is much weaker.

==Auroral events of historical significance==
The discovery of a 1770 Japanese [[diary]] in 2017 depicting auroras above the ancient Japanese capital of [[Kyoto]] suggested that the storm may have been 7% larger than the [[Carrington event]], which affected telegraph networks.&lt;ref name="1770 Japanese diary"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/aurora-kyoto-1770-painting-science-magnetic-storm |title=1770 Kyoto Diary |last=Frost |first=Natasha |date=2017-10-04 |website=Atlas Obscura |access-date=2017-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Inclined zenith aurora over Kyoto on 17 September 1770: Graphical evidence of extreme magnetic storm |journal=Space Weather |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1314–1320 |date=2017-09-17 |doi = 10.1002/2017SW001690|last1 = Kataoka|first1 = Ryuho|last2=Iwahashi |first2=Kiyomi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auroras that resulted from the "[[Solar storm of 1859|great geomagnetic storm]]" on both 28 August and 2 September 1859, however, are thought to be the most spectacular in recent recorded history. In a paper to the [[Royal Society]] on 21 November 1861, Balfour Stewart described both auroral events as documented by a self-recording [[magnetograph]] at the [[Kew Observatory]] and established the connection between the 2 September 1859 auroral storm and the [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Carrington]]-Hodgson flare event when he observed that, "It is not impossible to suppose that in this case our luminary was taken ''in the act''."&lt;ref name="BSp1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stewart |first=Balfour |jstor=111936 |title=On the Great Magnetic Disturbance of 28 August to 7 September 1859, as Recorded by Photography at the Kew Observatory |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=11 |date=1860–1862 |pages=407–10 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1860.0086}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second auroral event, which occurred on 2 September 1859 as a result of the exceptionally intense Carrington-Hodgson white light [[solar flare]] on 1 September 1859, produced auroras, so widespread and extraordinarily bright, that they were seen and reported in published scientific measurements, ship logs, and newspapers throughout the United States, Europe, Japan, and Australia. It was reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'' that in [[Boston]] on Friday 2 September 1859 the aurora was "so brilliant that at about one o'clock ordinary print could be read by the [[light]]".&lt;ref name="ADVSR1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.asr.2005.12.021 |title=Eyewitness reports of the great auroral storm of 1859 |journal=Advances in Space Research |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=2006 |pages=145–54 |last1=Green |first1=J |last2=Boardsen |first2=S |last3=Odenwald |first3=S |last4=Humble |first4=J |last5=Pazamickas |first5=K |bibcode=2006AdSpR..38..145G}}&lt;/ref&gt; One o'clock EST time on Friday 2 September, would have been 6:00 GMT and the self-recording [[magnetograph]] at the [[Kew Observatory]] was recording the [[geomagnetic storm]], which was then one hour old, at its full intensity. Between 1859 and 1862, [[Elias Loomis]] published a series of nine papers on the [[Elias Loomis#Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859|Great Auroral Exhibition of 1859]] in the ''[[American Journal of Science]]'' where he collected worldwide reports of the auroral event.

That aurora is thought to have been produced by one of the most intense [[coronal mass ejection]]s in history. It is also notable for the fact that it is the first time where the phenomena of auroral activity and electricity were unambiguously linked. This insight was made possible not only due to scientific [[magnetometer]] measurements of the era, but also as a result of a significant portion of the {{convert|125000|mi|km}} of [[electrical telegraph|telegraph]] lines then in service being significantly disrupted for many hours throughout the storm. Some telegraph lines, however, seem to have been of the appropriate length and orientation to produce a sufficient [[geomagnetically induced current]] from the [[electromagnetic field]] to allow for continued communication with the telegraph operator power supplies switched off. The following conversation occurred between two operators of the American Telegraph Line between [[Boston]] and [[Portland, Maine]], on the night of 2 September 1859 and reported in the ''Boston Traveler'':

{{Quotation|'''Boston operator (to Portland operator):''' "Please cut off your battery [power source] entirely for fifteen minutes."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland operator:''' "Will do so. It is now disconnected."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "Mine is disconnected, and we are working with the auroral current. How do you receive my writing?"&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland:''' "Better than with our batteries on. – Current comes and goes gradually."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "My current is very strong at times, and we can work better without the batteries, as the aurora seems to neutralize and augment our batteries alternately, making current too strong at times for our relay magnets. Suppose we work without batteries while we are affected by this trouble."&lt;br /&gt;
'''Portland:''' "Very well. Shall I go ahead with business?"&lt;br /&gt;
'''Boston:''' "Yes. Go ahead."}}

The conversation was carried on for around two hours using no [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] power at all and working solely with the current induced by the aurora, and it was said that this was the first time on record that more than a word or two was transmitted in such manner.&lt;ref name="ADVSR1" /&gt; Such events led to the general conclusion that

{{Quotation|The effect of the aurorae on the electric telegraph is generally to increase or diminish the electric current generated in working the wires. Sometimes it entirely neutralizes them, so that, in effect, no fluid is discoverable in them. The aurora borealis seems to be composed of a mass of electric matter, resembling in every respect, that generated by the electric galvanic battery. The currents from it change coming on the wires, and then disappear: the mass of the aurora rolls from the horizon to the zenith.&lt;ref&gt;''The British Colonist'', Vol. 2 No. 56, 19 October 1859, p. 1, accessed online at [http://britishcolonist.ca/display.php?issue=18591019&amp;pages=001,&amp;terms=aurora BritishColonist.ca]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831112729/http://britishcolonist.ca/display.php?issue=18591019&amp;pages=001%2C&amp;terms=aurora |date=31 August 2009 }}, on 19 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical theories, superstition and mythology==
An aurora was described by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[explorer]] [[Pytheas]] in the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Macleod, ''Explorers: Great Tales of Adventure and Endurance'', p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] wrote about auroras in the first book of his ''[[Naturales Quaestiones]]'', classifying them, for instance as ''pithaei'' ('barrel-like'); ''chasmata'' ('chasm'); ''pogoniae'' ('bearded'); ''cyparissae'' ('like [[cypress]] trees'), and describing their manifold colors. He wrote about whether they were above or below the [[clouds]], and recalled that under [[Tiberius]], an aurora formed above the port city of [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]] that was so intense and red that a cohort of the army, stationed nearby for fire duty, galloped to the rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, J.,[https://archive.org/stream/physicalsciencei00seneiala#page/38/mode/2up ''Physical Science in the time of Nero''] p.39-41, London, Macmillan, (1910), accessed online on 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that [[Pliny the Elder]] depicted the aurora borealis in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', when he refers to ''trabes'', ''chasma'', 'falling red flames' and 'daylight in the night'.&lt;ref&gt;Bostock, J. and Riley, H.T., ''The Natural History of Pliny: Volume II'', London, Bohn (1855), accessed online at [https://archive.org/stream/naturalhistoryof11855plin#page/62/mode/2up/search/aurora], on 1 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aurora australis.jpg|thumb|The Aboriginal Australians associated auroras (which are mainly low on the horizon and predominantly red) with fire.]]
In the traditions of [[Aboriginal Australians]], the Aurora Australis is commonly associated with fire. For example, the [[Gunditjmara people]] of western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] called auroras ''puae buae'' ('ashes'), while the [[Gunai people]] of eastern Victoria perceived auroras as [[Wildfire|bushfires]] in the spirit world. The [[Diyari|Dieri]] people of [[South Australia]] say that an auroral display is ''kootchee'', an evil spirit creating a large fire. Similarly, the [[Ngarrindjeri|Ngarrindjeri people]] of South Australia refer to auroras seen over [[Kangaroo Island]] as the campfires of spirits in the 'Land of the Dead'. Aboriginal people in southwest [[Queensland]] believe the auroras to be the fires of the ''Oola Pikka'', ghostly spirits who spoke to the people through auroras. Sacred law forbade anyone except male elders from watching or interpreting the messages of ancestors they believed were transmitted through an aurora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamacher |first=D.W. |title=Aurorae in Australian Aboriginal Traditions |journal=Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage |year=2013 |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=207–219 |url=http://www.narit.or.th/en/files/2013JAHHvol16/2013JAHH...16..207H.pdf |arxiv=1309.3367 |bibcode=2013JAHH...16..207H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bulfinch's Mythology]]'' relates that in [[Norse mythology]], the armour of the [[Valkyrie|Valkyrior]] "sheds a strange flickering light, which flashes up over the northern skies, making what Men call the 'aurora borealis', or 'Northern Lights' ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mythome.org/bxxxviii.html |title=Bullfinch's Mythology |publisher=Mythome.org |date=10 February 1996 |accessdate=5 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110214105537/http://www.mythome.org/bxxxviii.html |archivedate=14 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be no evidence in [[Old Norse literature]] to substantiate this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/njordrljos.htm |title=The Aurora Borealis and the Vikings |publisher=Vikinganswerlady.com |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Old Norse account of ''norðrljós'' is found in the Norwegian chronicle ''[[Konungs Skuggsjá]]'' from AD 1230. The chronicler has heard about this phenomenon from compatriots returning from [[Greenland]], and he gives three possible explanations: that the ocean was surrounded by vast fires; that the sun flares could reach around the world to its night side; or that [[glacier]]s could store energy so that they eventually became [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irf.se/norrsken/Norrsken_history.html |title=Norrsken history |publisher=Irf.se |date=12 November 2003 |accessdate=26 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721215920/http://www.irf.se/norrsken/Norrsken_history.html |archivedate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Walter William Bryant wrote in his book [[q:Kepler|''Kepler'']] (1920) that [[Tycho Brahe]] "seems to have been something of a [[Homeopathy|homœopathist]], for he recommends [[Sulfur#History|sulfur]] to cure infectious diseases "brought on by the sulphurous vapours of the Aurora Borealis."&lt;ref&gt;Walter William Bryant, {{Ws | [[s: Kepler|''Kepler'']]}} Macmillan Co.

In the 1740s [[Benjamin Franklin]] theorized in his paper ''Aurora Borealis, Suppositions and Conjectures towards forming an Hypothesis for its Explanation'' that an aurora was caused by a concentration of electrical charge in the polar regions intensified by the snow and moisture in the air:&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N. (ed.) (1931), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wojw-wmYrNwC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=benjamin+franklin+northern+lights#v=onepage&amp;q=benjamin%20franklin%20northern%20lights ''The Ingenious Dr Franklin''], p.2, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|text=May not then the great quantity of electricity brought into the polar regions by the clouds, which are condens'd there, and fall in snow, which electricity would enter the earth, but cannot penetrate the ice; may it not, I say (as a bottle overcharged) break thro' that low atmosphere and run along in the vacuum over the air towards the equator, diverging as the degrees of longitude enlarge, strongly visible where densest, and becoming less visible as it more diverges; till it finds a passage to the earth in more temperate climates, or is mingled with the upper air? |author=Benjamin Franklin|source=}}

Observations of the rhythmic movement of compass needles due to the influence of an aurora were confirmed in the Swedish city of [[Uppsala]] by [[Anders Celsius]] and [[Olof Hiorter]]. In 1741, Hiorter was able to link large magnetic fluctuations with an aurora being observed overhead. This evidence helped to support their theory that 'magnetic storms' are responsible for such compass fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;J. Oschman (2016), ''Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis'' (Elsevier, Edinburgh) p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Church 1911.4.1.jpg|thumb|[[Frederic Edwin Church|Church's]] 1865 painting ''[[Aurora Borealis (painting)|Aurora Borealis]]'']]
A variety of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] myths surround the spectacle. The European explorer [[Samuel Hearne]] traveled with [[Chipewyan|Chipewyan Dene]] in 1771 and recorded their views on the ''ed-thin'' ('caribou'). According to Hearne, the Dene people saw the resemblance between an aurora and the sparks produced when [[caribou]] fur is stroked. They believed that the lights were the spirits of their departed friends dancing in the sky, and when they shone brightly it meant that their deceased friends were very happy.&lt;ref&gt;Hearne, Samuel (1958). ''A Journey to the Northern Ocean: A journey from Prince of Wales' Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean in the years 1769, 1770, 1771, 1772''. Richard Glover (ed.). Toronto: The MacMillan Company of Canada. pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night after the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], an aurora was seen from the battlefield. The [[Confederate Army]] took this as a sign that God was on their side, as the lights were rarely seen so far south. The painting ''[[Aurora Borealis (painting)|Aurora Borealis]]'' by [[Frederic Edwin Church]] is widely interpreted to represent the conflict of the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=4806|title=''Aurora Borealis'' at the American Art Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid 19th-century British source says auroras were a rare occurrence before the 18th-century.&lt;ref&gt;''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.II'', (1847), London, Charles Knight, p.496&lt;/ref&gt; It quotes [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] as saying that before the aurora of 1716, no such phenomenon had been recorded for more than 80 years, and none of any consequence since 1574. It says no appearance is recorded in the [[French Academy of Sciences|''Transactions of the French Academy of Sciences'']] between 1666 and 1716. And that one aurora recorded in ''Berlin Miscellany'' for 1797 was called a very rare event. One observed in 1723 at [[Bologna]] was stated to be the first ever seen there. [[Anders Celsius|Celsius]] (1733) states the oldest residents of [[Uppsala]] thought the phenomenon a great rarity before 1716. The period between approximately 1645 to 1715 corresponds to the [[Maunder minimum]] in sunspot activity.

It was the Norwegian scientist [[Kristian Birkeland]] who, in the early 1900s, laid the foundation for our current understanding of geomagnetism and polar auroras.

==Non-terrestrial auroras==

[[Image:Jupiter.Aurora.HST.UV.jpg|thumb|[[Jupiter]] aurora; the far left bright spot connects magnetically to [[Io (moon)|Io]]; the spots at the bottom of the image lead to [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].]]

{{see also|Magnetosphere of Jupiter#Aurorae}}
Both [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] have magnetic fields that are stronger than Earth's (Jupiter's equatorial field strength is 4.3 gauss, compared to 0.3 gauss for Earth), and both have extensive radiation belts. Auroras have been observed on both gas planets, most clearly using the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], as well as on [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]].&lt;ref name="esa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMLQ71DU8E_index_0.html |title=ESA Portal – Mars Express discovers auroras on Mars |publisher=Esa.int |date=11 August 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The auroras on the gas giants seem, like Earth's, to be powered by the solar wind. In addition, however, Jupiter's moons, especially [[Io (moon)|Io]], are powerful sources of auroras on Jupiter. These arise from electric currents along field lines ("field aligned currents"), generated by a dynamo mechanism due to the relative motion between the rotating planet and the moving moon. Io, which has active [[volcanism]] and an ionosphere, is a particularly strong source, and its currents also generate radio emissions, which have been studied since 1955. Using the Hubble Space Telescope, auroras over Io, Europa and Ganymede have all been observed.

Auroras have also been observed on [[Venus]] and [[Mars]]. Venus has no magnetic field and so Venusian auroras appear as bright and diffuse patches of varying shape and intensity, sometimes distributed over the full disc of the planet. A Venusian aurora originates when electrons from the solar wind collide with the night-side atmosphere.

An aurora was detected on Mars, on 14 August 2004, by the SPICAM instrument aboard [[Mars Express]]. The aurora was located at [[Terra Cimmeria]], in the region of 177° East, 52° South. The total size of the emission region was about 30&amp;nbsp;km across, and possibly about 8&amp;nbsp;km high. By analyzing a map of crustal magnetic anomalies compiled with data from [[Mars Global Surveyor]], scientists observed that the region of the emissions corresponded to an area where the strongest magnetic field is localized. This correlation indicated that the origin of the light emission was a flux of electrons moving along the crust magnetic lines and exciting the upper atmosphere of Mars.&lt;ref name="esa"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=18 February 2006 |url=http://www.universetoday.com/am/publish/mars_express_aurorae.html?1722006 |title=Mars Express Finds Auroras on Mars |publisher=Universe Today |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ever [[Extra-solar object|extra-solar]] auroras were discovered in July 2015 over the [[brown dwarf]] star [[LSR J1835+3259]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/monstrous-aurora-detected-beyond-our-solar-system-150729.htm |title=Monstrous Aurora Detected Beyond our Solar System |last1=O'Neill |first1=Ian |date=29 July 2015 |website=news.discovery.com |publisher=Discovery |access-date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mainly red aurora was found to be a million times brighter than the Northern Lights, a result of the charged particles interacting with hydrogen in the atmosphere. It has been speculated that stellar winds may be stripping off material from the surface of the brown dwarf to produce its own electrons. Another possible explanation for the auroras is that an as-yet-undetected body around the dwarf star is throwing off material, as is the case with Jupiter and its moon Io.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/30087-alien-auroras-found-beyond-solar-system.html |title=First Alien Auroras Found, Are 1 Million Times Brighter Than Any On Earth |last1=Q.

The '''bioecological model''' is a theoretical model of [[gene–environment interaction]]s in [[Developmental psychology|human development]]. This model, first proposed by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]] and [[Stephen J. Ceci]],&lt;ref name="bronceci"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Bronfenbrenner U, Ceci SJ |title=Nature-nurture reconceptualized in developmental perspective: a bioecological model |journal=Psychological Review |volume=101 |issue=4 |pages=568–586 |date=October 1994 |pmid=7984707 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295X.101.4.568}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1994, is an extension of Bronfenbrenner's original theoretical model of human development, called [[ecological systems theory]]. Bronfenbrenner developed the bioecological model after recognizing that the individual was overlooked in other theories of human development, which were largely focused on the context of development (e.g., the environment).

The bioecological model of human development can be applied to both children and maturing adults, and is thus a lifespan approach to development. The framework emphasizes the importance of understanding bidirectional influences between individuals’ development and their surrounding environmental contexts.In the bioecological model, in contrast to his earlier models, Bronfenbrenner also includes time (known as the chronosystem in his model) as an important component in the way that people and environments change. The bioecological model proposed a new method of conducting research which was heavily influential in [[developmental psychology]] and is still considered relevant today.

== The original model ==
Bronfenbrenner named his original model "[[Ecological Systems Theory]]". Through this framework, Bronfenbrenner identified the need to understand individuals’ development within their environments. In order to conceptualize environmental contexts, Bronfenbrenner described four ecological systems:
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Urie Bronfenbrenner's Bioecological Model.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Urie Bronfenbrenner's Model.]] --&gt;
# ''Microsystem'': The microsystem is the innermost layer of Bronfenbrenner's model. This context is closest to an individual and encompasses interpersonal relationships and direct interactions with immediate surroundings.&lt;ref name="microsystem"&gt;Berk, L.E. (2000). Child Development (5th ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn and Bacon, 23-28. {{ISBN|0205286348}} https://openlibrary.org/books/OL35893M/Child_development&lt;/ref&gt; For example, family members and a child's school are considered part of the microsystem.
# ''Mesosystem'': The mesosystem includes interactions between various aspects of the microsystem. A relationship between a child's family and the child's school can be considered part of the mesosystem, because these two direct influences (parts of the microsystem) may interact.
# ''Exosystem'': The exosystem does not directly affect individuals; rather, the exosystem encompasses aspects of structures within the microsystem.&lt;ref name="microsystem" /&gt; For example, financial difficulties within the family of origin, parental job loss, and so forth may affect a child, but do not involve the child directly.
# ''Macrosystem'': The macrosystem is the outermost layer of Bronfenbrenner's model. This system includes social or cultural ideologies and beliefs that affect an individual's environment.&lt;ref name=bergen&gt;{{cite book|author=Bergen, D. |title=Human development:  traditional and contemporary theories |year=2008 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=0131343971 |page=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, laws may be incorporated into the macrosystem.&lt;ref name=bergen /&gt;
# ''Chronosystem:''Bronfenbrenner suggested that individuals constantly interact with these systems. He also stated that both individuals and their environments constantly affect one another.&lt;ref name=bergen /&gt; However, in this original model, Bronfenbrenner recognized there was not enough focus on individuals’ own role in their development,&lt;ref name="tudge"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tudge, J.R.H. |author2=Mokrova, I. |author3=Hatfield, B.E. |author4= Karnik, R.B. |year=2009 |title=Uses and misuses of Bronfenbrenner’s bioecological theory of human development |journal=Journal of Family Theory and Review |volume=1 |pages=198–210|url= http://www.uncg.edu/hdf/facultystaff/Tudge/Tudge,%20Mokrova,%20Hatfield,%20%26%20Karnik,%202009.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1756-2589.2009.00026.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus began further developing this model.

== Evolution of Bronfenbrenner's theory ==
Bronfenbrenner informally discussed new ideas concerning [[Ecological Systems Theory]] throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s during lectures and presentations to the psychological community.&lt;ref name=bron&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Urie Bronfenbrenner  |author2=Morris, P.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006 |title= The bioecological model of human development |journal=Handbook of Child Psychology |volume=1 |pages= 793–828 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |doi= 10.1002/9780470147658.chpsy0114}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he examined his original theory, he began to identify the role of other key factors in development. In 1986, Bronfenbrenner published his new theory and named it Bioecological Systems Theory.&lt;ref name=bronf&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bronfenbrenner, U. |author2= Morris, P.A. |title= The ecology of developmental processes |year=1998 |journal=Handbook of Child Psychology |volume=1 |location=New York |isbn=0-471-05527-1 |pages=993–1023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Bronfenbrenner's main influences was [[Lev Vygotsky]], a Russian teacher and psychologist. Vygotsky created the [[Observational learning|social learning]] theory of development in the 1920s and 1930s to understand how people learn in social contexts and how social environments influence the learning process (1962). Vygotsky recognized that learning always occurs and cannot be separated from a social context and that this process is integral to a child's development.&lt;ref&gt;Neff, L. S. (n.d.). [http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/lsn/educator/edtech/learningtheorieswebsite/vygotsky.htm Lev Vygotsky and social learning theories].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kurt Lewin]], a German forerunner of ecological systems models and the founder of modern [[social psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;Greathouse, J. (1997, May). Kurt Lewin. Retrieved from Psychology History website:  http://muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/lewin.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814001331/http://muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/lewin.htm |date=2012-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pioneered the use of theory and experimentation to test hypotheses. He focused on the life space, which he defined as a person's psychological activities that occur within a kind of psychological field.&lt;ref&gt;Kneessi, D. F. (2002). Bioscopes: Kurt Lewin. Retrieved from Kurt Lewin website:   http://faculty.frostburg.edu/mbradley/psyography/bioscopes_kurtlewin.html&lt;/ref&gt; The life space that contains all the events in the past, present, and future that shape and affect an individual. This focus on individuality led him to diagram the life space, containing arrows leading to and from possible life goals, both positive and negative. In sum, Lewin's ecological systems model emphasized situational and proximal causes. Additionally, Lewin's theory demonstrates that behavior is a function of the current person by their environment, which are all affected by past experience.

Bronfenbrenner was also influenced by his colleague, [[Stephen J. Ceci]], with whom he co-authored the article “Nature-nurture reconceptualized in developmental perspective: A bioecological theory” in 1994.&lt;ref name="bronceci" /&gt; Ceci is a developmental psychologist who redefined modern developmental psychology's approach to intellectual development. He focused on predicting a pattern of associations among ecological, genetic, and cognitive variables as a function of proximal processes. Together, Bronfenbrenner and Ceci published the beginnings of the bioecological model and made it an accessible framework to use in understanding developmental processes.&lt;ref name="bronceci" /&gt;

== History ==
The history of bioecological systems theory is divided into two periods. The first period resulted in the publication of Bronfenbrenner's theory of ecological systems theory, titled ''The Ecology of Human Development'', in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8cf0FYm0jW0C The Ecology of Human Development:  Experiments by nature and design]. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1-348. {{ISBN|0674224574}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronfenbrenner described the second period as a time of criticism and evaluation of his original work.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt;

The development of ecological systems theory arose because Bronfenbrenner noted a lack of focus on the role of context in terms of development. He argued the environment in which children operate is important because development may be shaped by their interactions with the specific environment. He urged his colleagues to study development in terms of ecological contexts, that is the normal environments of children (schools, homes, daycares). Researchers heeded his advice and a great deal of research flourished in the early 1980s that focused on context.

However, where prior research was ignoring context, Bronfenbrenner felt current research focused too much on context and ignored development. In his justification for a new theory, Bronfenbrenner wrote he was not pleased with the direction of research in the mid 1980s and that he felt there were other realms of development that were overlooked.&lt;ref name=bron /&gt;

In comparison to the original theory, bioecological systems theory adds more emphasis to the person in the context of development. Additionally, Bronfenbrenner chose to leave out key features of the ecological systems theory (e.g., [[ecological validity]] and ecological experiments) during his development of bioecological systems theory.  As a whole, Bronfenbrenner's new theory continued to go through a series of transformations as he continuously analyzed different factors in human development. Critical components of bioecological systems theory did not emerge all at once. Instead, his ideas evolved and adapted to the research and ideas of the times.  For example, the role of proximal processes, which is now recognized as a key feature of bioecological systems theory, did not emerge until the 1990s.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt; This theory went through a series of transformations and elaborations until 2005 when Bronfenbrenner died.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt;

== Process–Person–Context–Time ==
Bronfenbrenner further developed the model by adding the chronosystem, which refers to how the person and environments change over time. He also placed a greater emphasis on processes and the role of the biological person. The Process–Person–Context–Time Model (PPCT) has since become the bedrock of the bioecological model. PPCT includes four concepts. The interactions between the concepts form the basis for the theory.&lt;ref name=bron /&gt;

: 1. Process - Bronfenbrenner viewed proximal processes as the primary mechanism for development, featuring them in two central propositions of the bioecological model.

::::''Proposition 1'': [H]uman development takes place through processes of progressively more complex reciprocal interaction between an active, evolving biopsychological human organism and the persons, objects, and symbols in its immediate external environment. To be effective, the interaction must occur on a fairly regular basis over extended periods of time. Such enduring forms of interaction in the immediate environment are referred to as proximal processes.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt;

::Proximal processes are the development processes of systematic interaction between person and environment.&lt;ref name=bergen /&gt; Bronfenbrenner identifies group and solitary activities such as playing with other children or reading as mechanisms through which children come to understand their world and formulate ideas about their place within it.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt; However, processes function differently depending on the person and the context.

::::''Proposition 2:'' The form, power, content, and direction of the proximal processes effecting development vary systematically as a joint function of the characteristics of the developing person; of the environment—both immediate and more remote—in which the processes are taking place; the nature of the developmental outcomes under consideration; and the social continuities and changes occurring over time through the life course and the historical period during which the person has lived.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt;

: 2. Person – Bronfenbrenner acknowledged the role that personal characteristics of individuals play in social interactions.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt; He identified three personal characteristics that can significantly influence proximal processes across the lifespan. Demand characteristics such as age, gender or physical appearance set processes in motion, acting as “personal stimulus” characteristics.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt; Resource characteristics are not as immediately recognizable and include mental and emotional resources such as past experiences, intelligence, and skills as well as material resources such as access to housing, education, and responsive caregivers.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt; Force characteristics are related to variations in motivation, persistence and temperament. Bronfenbrenner notes that even when children have equivalent access to resources, their developmental courses may differ as a function of characteristics such as drive to succeed and persistence in the face of hardship. In doing this, Bronfenbrenner provides a rationale for how environments (i.e., the systems mentioned above under “The Original Model: Ecological Systems Theory”) influence personal characteristics, yet also suggests personal characteristics can change environments.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt;

: 3. Context  - Context involves five interconnected systems, which are based on Bronfenbrenner’s original model, ecological systems theory. The microsystem describes environments such as home or school in which children spend significant time interacting. Mesosystems are interrelations between microsystems. The exosystem describes events that have important indirect influence on development (e.g., a parent consistently working late).&lt;ref name=bergen /&gt; The macrosystem is a feature of any group (culture, subculture) that share values and belief systems. The chronosystem describes historical circumstances that affect contexts at all other levels.&lt;ref name=bronf /&gt;

: 4. Time – Time has a prominent place in this developmental model. It is constituted at three levels: micro, meso, and macro. Micro-time refers to what is happening during specific episodes of proximal processes. Meso-time refers to the extent to which the processes occur in the person’s environment, such as over the course of days, weeks or years.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt; Macro-time (or the chronosystem) focuses on the shifting expectancies in wider culture. This functions both within and across generations and affects proximal processes across the lifespan.&lt;ref name=bron /&gt;
 	
Thus, the bioecological model highlights the importance of understanding a person's development within environmental systems. It further explains that both the person and the environment affect one another bidirectionally. Although even Bronfenbrenner himself critiqued the falsifiability of the model,&lt;ref name=bergen /&gt; the bioecological model has real world applications for developmental research, practice, and policies (as demonstrated below).

== Research implications ==
In addition to adding to the theoretical understanding of human development, the bioecological model lends itself to changes in the conceptualization of the research endeavor. In some of his earliest comments on the state of developmental research, Bronfenbrenner lamented that developmental research concerned itself with studying “strange behavior of children in strange situations for the briefest possible period of time”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bronfenbrenner, U. |year=1974 |title=Developmental research, public policy, and the ecology of childhood |journal=Child Development |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |publisher=Wiley |doi=10.2307/1127743 |jstor=1127743}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed, rather, that developmental science should take as its goal a study of children in context in order to best determine which processes are naturally “developmentally generative” (promote development) and which are naturally “developmentally disruptive” (prevent development).

Bronfenbrenner set up a contrast to the traditional “confirmatory” approach to hypothesis testing (in which research is done to “confirm” that a hypothesis is correct or incorrect) when specifying the types of research needed to support the bioecological model of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bronfenbrenner, U. |year=2005 |title=Making human beings human: Bioecological perspectives on human development |pages=3–15 |publisher=Sage Publications Ltd |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn= 0-7619-2711-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Bronfenbrenner's view, the dynamic nature of the model calls for “primarily generative” research designs that explore interactions between proximal processes (see Proposition 1) and the developing person, environment, time, and developmental outcome (Proposition 2).  Bronfenbrenner called this type of research the “discovery mode” of developmental science.

To best capture such dynamic processes, developmental research designs would ideally be [[Longitudinal study|longitudinal]] (over time), rather than [[cross-sectional data|cross-sectional]] (a single point in time), and conducted in children's natural environments, rather than a laboratory. Such designs would thus occur in schools, homes, day-care centers, and other environments in which proximal processes are most likely to occur. The bioecological model also proposes that the most scientifically rich studies would include more than one distinct but theoretically related proximal process in the same design.&lt;ref name=bron /&gt; Indeed, studies that claim to be based upon bioecological theory should include elements of process, person, context, and time, and should include explicit explanation and acknowledgement if one of the elements is lacking.&lt;ref name="tudge" /&gt; Based on the interactions of proposed elements of the PPCT model, appropriate statistical analyses of PPCT data would likely include explorations of mediation and moderation effects, as well as multilevel modeling of data to account for the nesting of different components of the model. Moreover, research that includes both genetic and environmental components would capture even more of the bioecological model's elements.

== Role of technology ==
In today's interconnected world, communication and electronic devices have a huge effect on the micro-cellular structure and complex bio-chemistry of our brains which eventually affects our personality, behavior and characteristics. A research conducted by Harvard medical school, highlighted the power of human imagination and the structural changes it causes to the human brain at the micro-cellular level thus bringing about changes in character personality or behaviour.  The scientist argues that if imagination could bring about such permanent changes in the brain, the effects of digital technology on a human brain can produce behavioural changes such as shorter attention span, reduction in communication skills and abstract thinking. However, there is enough research to prove the positive effects of ‘brain-training’ computer games aimed at keeping the brain cells active. (Greenfield, 2014, #13)

According to technology writer Nicholas Carr, technology has always determined the development of the brain and the way we think throughout History. As he illustrates with examples of reading and the rise in the use of internet. He observes that development of reading habits motivated our brains to be concentrate on the text and imagine, whereas the over exposure of internet reinforce our capability to scan and filter information productively and easily. (Taylor, 2012, #14)
Attention is the key requisite which paves the way to all aspects of learning viz. perception, memory, language, creativity, reasoning, problem solving and decision making. Attention has been considered to be a highly malleable quality which can be influenced by the environment. Research shows that the invention of digital entertainment changed the attention span by presenting children with visual stimuli and very little need of imagination. In such an environment distraction becomes the norm and memory, focusing gets affected. This is in sharp contradiction to the children of the past who spent a great amount of their time reading, which requires deep and consistent attention, imagination, memory and which gave way to minimal distractions. (Taylor, 2012, #14)

However studies have shown that a visual media improves visual-spatial capabilities (Green, Bavelier 2010, #15) and capacity to identify relevant information in text filled with hyperlinks and ads. Thus technology maybe making children viewing information differently compared to the children of yesteryear. In short children are more skilled at remembering where to find information rather than remembering information itself. Thus the brain may be allowed to be involved in higher order activities such as contemplation, critical thinking and problem solving. (Taylor, 2012, #14)

'''Feel / ability to empathize''' 
According to a study on two groups of sixth-graders, kids who had no access to electronic devices for five days picked up on emotions and non-verbal cues better than those who used their devices during that time. (De Loatch, 2015, #16)

== Ecological techno subsystem ==

Ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979) emerged before the advent of Internet revolution and the developmental influence of then available technology (e.g., television) was conceptually situated in the child's microsystem. Johnson and Puplampu (2008) proposed the ecological techno-subsystem, a dimension of the microsystem. Ecological techno-subsystem, a refinement to Bronfenbrenner's theoretical organization of environmental influences on child development.

The word ecological techno-subsystem comprises both child interaction with living (e.g., peers, parents, teachers) and non-living (e.g., hardware, gadgets) elements of communication, information, and recreation technologies in immediate or direct environments.

An experimental study of 128 children from first to sixth grade was conducted to assess their cognitive development, based on their use of internet at home and socioeconomic characteristics of the family.

'''Measures and Results''' 
Three constructs, corresponding to three ecological systems/subsystems, were measured: child cognitive development (bioecology), indices of child use of the Internet at home (techno-subsystem), and family socioeconomic characteristics (microsystem).

For the chosen sample of children, both father's education and mother's employment were associated with measures of child cognitive development. Educated fathers tended to have children who scored high on three of the four cognitive measures (expressive language, visual perception, and auditory memory) as they may provide enhanced language models and stimulating learning environments to their children. Employed  mothers  tended to have children who had high scores on the measure of metacognitive planning as they could train their children to develop internet usage skills  and effective  management of  information .

The indices of  use of internet at home accounted for more variance in their development than the indices of socioeconomic status. The ecological techno-subsystem improves our understanding of the influences of environment on child development by stressing the effect of digital technologies on cognitive growth during childhood.

While Internet use during childhood has been associated with negative developmental outcomes, research increasingly suggests that the Internet provides children with more developmental advantages than disadvantages ''(Greenfield &amp; Yan, 2006).''

The Internet, although rich in graphic display, is primarily a text-based medium; “the more a child uses the Internet, the more he/she reads” ''(Jackson et al., 2007, p. 188)''. Exposure to computer during the preschool years increased school readiness later ''(Li and Atkins (2004).''

Jackson and colleagues (2006) provided low income children with home-based Internet access and continuously recorded time online. Their findings indicated that children who used the Internet more had higher scores on standardized tests of reading achievement and higher grade point compared to those children who used the Internet less (p.&amp;nbsp;429).

From a developmental perspective, Internet use stimulates cognitive processes involved in interpreting text and images ''(Johnson, 2006).'' Metacognitive processes such as planning, search strategies, and evaluation of information are exercised when navigating websites ''(Tarpley, 2001).'' ''DeBell and Chapman (2006)'' concluded that Internet use promotes cognitive development in children, “specifically in the area of visual intelligence, where certain computer activities -- particularly games -- may enhance the ability to monitor several visual stimuli at once, to read diagrams, recognize icons, and visualize spatial relationships” (p.&amp;nbsp;3).

Comprehensive theoretical description of the developmental effect of Internet use is required. The recently proposed ecological techno-subsystem ''(Johnson &amp; Puplampu, 2008)'' provides a conceptual framework for understanding the effect of Internet use on child development.

CAF-1 is required for the spatial organization and [[epigenetics|epigenetic]] marking of [[heterochromatin]] domains in pluripotent [[embryon]]ic cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | year = 2006 | title = CAF-1 Is Essential for Heterochromatin Organization in Pluripotent Embryonic Cells | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020181 | journal = PLoS Genet | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e181 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0020181 | last1 = Houlard | first1 = Martin | last2 = Berlivet | first2 = Soizik | last3 = Probst | first3 = Aline V. | last4 = Quivy | first4 = Jean-Pierre | last5 = Héry | first5 = Patrick | last6 = Almouzni | first6 = Geneviève | last7 = Gérard | first7 = Matthieu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells resembling 2-cell-stage mouse embryos ([[Cell potency|totipotent]] cells) can be induced in vitro through downregulation of the chromatin-assembly activity of CAF-1 in [[embryonic stem cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ishiuchi | first1 = T. | last2 = Enriquez-Gasca | first2 = R. | last3 = Mizutani | first3 = E. | last4 = Bošković | first4 = A. | last5 = Ziegler-Birling | first5 = C. | last6 = Rodriguez-Terrones | first6 = D. | last7 = Torres-Padilla | first7 = M.

Optimal modulation of both CAF-1 and [[transcription factor]] levels increases reprogramming efficiency by several orders of magnitude and facilitated [[iPS cell]] formation in as little as 4 days. Mechanistically, CAF-1 suppression led to a more accessible chromatin structure at enhancer elements early during reprogramming. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in somatic heterochromatin domains, increased binding of [[Sox2]] to [[pluripotency]]-specific targets and activation of associated genes. Suppression of CAF-1 also enhance the [[Induced stem cells#Direct transdifferentiation|direct conversion]] of [[B cells]] into [[macrophages]] and [[fibroblast]]s into [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheloufi S, Elling U, Hopfgartner B ''et al'' | year = 2015| title = The histone chaperone CAF-1 safeguards somatic cell identity | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v528/n7581/full/nature15749.html| journal = Nature | volume = 528 | issue = 7581| pages = 218–224 | doi = 10.1038/nature15749 | pmid = 26659182| pmc = 4866648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capella''' is an [[Open Source]] solution for model-based systems engineering ([[MBSE]]). Hosted at polarsys.org, this solution provides a process and tooling for graphical [[Systems modeling|modeling]] of [[Systems architecture|systems]], [[Hardware architecture|hardware]] or [[Software architecture|software]] architectures, in accordance with the principles and recommendations defined by the [[Arcadia (engineering)|Arcadia]] method. Capella is an initiative of [[PolarSys]], one of several [[Eclipse Foundation]] working groups.

== Usage == 
Capella is mainly used for modeling [[Complex system|complex]] and [[Life-critical system|safety-critical]] systems in embedded systems development for industries such as aerospace, avionics, transportation, space, communications and security and automotive.

== History == 
Capella was created by [[Thales Group|Thales]] in 2007, and has been under continuous development and evolution since then. 
The objective is to contribute to the transformation of [[engineering]], providing an engineering environment which approach is based on models rather than focused on documents, piloted by a process, and offering, by construction, ways to ensure effective co-engineering. Operational experts from engineering then defined a unified language for modeling architectures in the group and specified the associated tooling, Capella.

Capella provides ergonomics that are similar to [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] / [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] tools. Hence, the resulting environment is actually intuitive and allows engineers to focus on defining their architectures instead of learning and operating complex generic modeling languages, such as [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] or [[SysML]], to capture their design requirements. Because it is based on the [[Arcadia (engineering)|Arcadia]] method, it also guides engineers in their activities, which generic modeling tools in general, do not do. In 2015, Capella was released as an Eclipse open source project by PolarSys, a Working Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polarsys.org/proposals/capella|title=PolarSys Proposal for Capella|accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Eclipse Foundation through the French collaborative project Clarity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarity-se.org/|title=Ecosystem for the Model Based Systems Engineering Solution Capella|accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; supported by the [[Banque Publique d’Investissement]] (Bpifrance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpifrance.fr/|title=Bpifrance website|accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
Capella has its own life cycle. A major release, providing new functionality is delivered each year end while several versions called minor, including bugs fixes, are generally delivered over the course of the year.

== Principles == 
Capella comes with its own [[Metamodeling|metamodel]], which defines the language [[concept]]s the user can enable in a Capella project. The user creates an [[Object (computer science)|instance]] of this metamodel and can then view the model from various perspectives through diagrams, according to his/her concerns. The user can also, via the palette associated with diagrams, create new model elements. A Capella project consists of a model part ("melodymodeller") and a graphic part ("aird").

[[File: Capella HMI.png | thumb| Workbench [[Graphical user interface|GUI]]]]

[[File: Capella SDFB.png | thumb|Diagrams with set of tools]]

When a Capella project is created, the workbench interface is presented to the user. It contains various areas:
* The "methodological browser" area, shows the user the various engineering phases for architecture modeling and shortcuts to create new diagrams within the given engineering phase; this view also facilitates the "transition" between engineering phases, so as to create links between phases and associated elements;
* The "semantic browser" area provides tools for navigating into the model: for each selected item in the "project" area or on a diagram, the semantic browser area will present the user all references for that element, that is, its capacity or reference relationships and all diagrams in which the element is involved;
* The "project" area is a more traditional view; it is a tree view of the Capella model, and contains all the semantic elements and diagrams created by the user;
* The "diagram" area presents a graphical view of an extract of the model and allows the user to edit the model. The user can create, modify or delete elements and can also change the organization or appearance of elements in the diagram;
* The "properties" area displays all the properties of a selected element in the model or in a diagram.

== Diagrams == 
Through Capella, the user can handle several types of diagrams. The representation of elements in diagrams is governed by a color code specific to each type of analysis. 
Some examples of diagrams:

&lt;gallery&gt;

Image: Capella LAB.png | Logical Architecture
Image: Capella PAB.png | Physical Architecture
Image: Capella Scenario.png | Functional Scenario
Image: Capella CDB.png | Class Diagram
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Extensibility == 
The workbench can be enhanced or specialized for a given business need, according to the concept of "Point of View", defined by the standard ISO/IEC 42010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/|title=ISO / IEC / IEEE 42010: 2011, Systems and software engineering - Architecture description|accessdate=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These extensions provide, for example:
* The ability to manage new information specific to a particular engineering need with its associated tooling. For example, non-functional properties such as time constraints for performance analysis, or constraints related to safety or security, cost of component for cost analysis, mass, etc. ;
* The ability to specify the engineering approach with various architectural styles;
* The ability to add new features to the workbench, such as a documentation export or a specialization of the transition system / subsystem mechanism.

== Compatibility == 
Capella is supported on environments based on [[Java (programming language)|Java]] 7 and higher on the following platforms:
* [[GNU]] / [[Linux]]
* [[Mac OS X]]
* [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]]

== Dependencies == 
The latest version of Capella is based on:
* [[Eclipse Sirius|Sirius]]

The '''Cass identity model''' is one of the fundamental theories of [[LGBT|gay and lesbian]] identity development, developed in 1979 by Vivienne Cass.&lt;ref&gt; Cass, V. (1979). Homosexual identity formation: A theoretical model. Journal of Homosexuality, 4 (3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This model was one of the first to treat gay people as "normal" in a [[Heterosexism|heterosexist]] society and in a climate of [[homophobia]] instead of treating homosexuality itself as a problem. Cass described a process of six stages of gay and lesbian identity development. While these stages are sequential, some people might revisit stages at different points in their lives.

== The six stages of Cass' model ==
=== Identity confusion ===

In the first stage, ''identity confusion'', the person is amazed to think of themselves as a gay person. "Could I be gay?" This stage begins with the person's first awareness of gay or lesbian thoughts, feelings, and attractions. The people typically feel confused and experience turmoil.

To the question "Who am I?", the answers can be acceptance, psychological self-[[denial]] and [[Psychological repression|repression]], or rejection.

Possible responses can be: to avoid information about lesbians and gays; inhibited behavior; self-[[denial]] of homosexuality ("experimenting", "an accident", "just drunk", "just looking"). Men often keep emotional involvement separated from sexual contact; women often have deep, strongly emotional but non-sexual relationships.

The possible needs can be: the person may explore internal positive and negative judgments. Will be allowed to be uncertain regarding sexual identity. May find support in knowing that [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] occurs along a spectrum. May receive permission and encouragement to explore sexual identity as a normal experience (like career identity and social identity).

=== Identity comparison ===

The second stage is called ''identity comparison''. In this stage, the person accepts the possibility of being gay or lesbian and examines the wider implications of that tentative commitment. "Maybe this does apply to me." The self-alienation becomes isolation.
The task is to deal with the social alienation.

Possible responses can be: the person may begin to grieve for losses and the things they give up by embracing their sexual orientation (marriage, children). They may compartmentalize their own sexuality&amp;mdash;accept lesbian/gay definition of behavior but maintain "heterosexual" identity. Tells oneself, "It's only temporary"; "I'm just in love with this particular woman/man"; etc.

The possible needs can be: will be very important that the person develops own definitions. Will need information about sexual identity, lesbian, gay community resources, encouragement to talk about loss of heterosexual life expectations. May be permitted to keep some "heterosexual" identity (as "not an all or none" issue).

=== Identity tolerance ===

In the third stage, ''identity tolerance'', the person comes to the understanding they are "not the only one".

The person acknowledges they are likely gay or lesbian and seeks out other gay and lesbian people to combat feelings of isolation. Increased commitment to being lesbian or gay.
The task is to decrease social alienation by seeking out lesbians and gays.

Possible responses can be: beginning to have language to talk and think about the issue. Recognition that being lesbian or gay does not preclude other options. Accentuate difference between self and heterosexuals. Seek out lesbian and gay culture (positive contact leads to more positive sense of self, negative contact leads to devaluation of the culture, stops growth). The person may try out variety of stereotypical roles.

The possible needs can be: to be supported in exploring own shame feelings derived from [[heterosexism]], as well as [[internalized homophobia]]. Receive support in finding positive lesbian, gay community connections. It is particularly important for the person to know community resources.

=== Identity acceptance ===

The ''identity acceptance'' stage means the person accepts themselves. "I will be okay." The person attaches a positive connotation to their gay or lesbian identity and accepts rather than tolerates it. There is continuing and increased contact with the gay and lesbian culture.
The task is to deal with inner tension of no longer subscribing to society's norm, attempt to bring congruence between private and public view of self.

Possible responses can be: accepts gay or lesbian self-identification. May compartmentalize "gay life". Maintain less and less contact with heterosexual community. Attempt to "fit in" and "not make waves" within the gay and lesbian community. Begin some selective disclosures of sexual identity. More social coming out; more comfortable being seen with groups of men or women that are identified as "gay". More realistic evaluation of situation.

The possible needs can be: continue exploring grief and loss of heterosexual life expectation, continue exploring internalized homophobia (learned shame from heterosexist society). Find support in making decisions about where, when, and to whom to disclose.

=== Identity pride ===

In the ''identity pride'' stage, sometimes the coming out of the closet arrives, and the main thinking is "I've got to let people know who I am!" The person divides the world into heterosexuals and homosexuals, and is immersed in gay and lesbian culture while minimizing contact with heterosexuals. Us-them quality to political/social viewpoint.
The task is to deal with the incongruent views of heterosexuals.

Possible responses include: splits world into "gay" (good) and "straight" (bad)&amp;mdash;experiences disclosure crises with heterosexuals as they are less willing to "blend in"&amp;mdash;identify gay culture as sole source of support, acquiring all gay friends, business connections, social connections.

The possible needs can be: to receive support for exploring anger issues, to find support for exploring issues of heterosexism, to develop skills for coping with reactions and responses to disclosure to sexual identity, and to resist being defensive.

=== Identity synthesis ===

The last stage in Cass' model is ''identity synthesis'': the person integrates their sexual identity with all other aspects of self, and sexual orientation becomes ''only one aspect'' of self rather than the entire identity.

The task is to integrate gay and lesbian identity so that instead of being the identity, it is an aspect of self.

Possible responses can be: continues to be angry at heterosexism, but with decreased intensity, or allows trust of others to increase and build. Gay and lesbian identity is integrated with all aspects of "self". The person feels "all right" to move out into the community and not simply define space according to sexual orientation.

== Criticisms of the model ==

Joanne Kaufman and Cathryn Johnson have argued that based upon more recent research, this model is less valid today than it was at its inception for several reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Joanne and Johnson, Cathryn (2004) Stigmatized Individuals and the Process of Identity, ''The Sociological Quarterly'', 45 (4), 807–33&lt;/ref&gt;

#This model does not take into account socio-cultural factors that can impact identity development.
#The nature of the [[social stigma]] and its management practices have changed since the inception of the model.
#The linear nature of the model would suggest that anyone who abandons the model or fails to go through each of the six stages would not be able to be considered as a well adjusted homosexual, which may no longer be true.

[[File:Anschn-citrus.jpg|thumb|Various citrus types in cross section. Some of them are [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between two or more original species. &lt;br /&gt;
The [[botanical classification]] of the species, hybrids, varieties and cultivars belonging to the genus ''Citrus'' is called "citrus taxonomy".]]
'''Citrus taxonomy''' refers to the [[botanical classification]] of the [[species]], [[variety (botany)|varieties]], [[cultivars]], and [[Graft-chimaera|graft hybrids]] within the [[genus]] ''[[Citrus]]'' and related genera, found in cultivation and in the wild.

Citrus taxonomy is complex.&lt;ref name=Moore&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11525837 |title=Oranges and lemons: clues to the taxonomy of ''Citrus'' from molecular markers |author=G. A.

Some are only selections of the original wild types, while others are [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between two or more ancestors. Citrus plants hybridize easily between species with completely different morphologies, and similar-looking citrus fruits may have quite different ancestries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v32/n7/full/nbt.2954.html | title=A genealogy of the citrus family | last1=Velasco | first1=Riccardo | last2=Licciardello | first2=Concetta |journal=Nature Biotechnology | year=2014 | volume=32 | pages=640–642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sequencing of diverse mandarin, pomelo and orange genomes reveals complex history of admixture during citrus domestication |journal=Nature Biotechnology |author=G Albert Wu|display-authors=etal |volume=32 |doi=10.1038/nbt.2906 |pages=656–662 |pmid=24908277 |pmc=4113729}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some differ only in disease resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/135/4/341.full |title=The Origin of Cultivated Citrus as Inferred from Internal Transcribed Spacer and Chloroplast DNA Sequence and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Fingerprints|last1=Li | first1=Xiaomeng | last2=Xie | first2=Rangjin | last3=Lu | first3=Zhenhua | last4=Zhou | first4=Zhiqin | journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science | volume=135 | pages=341–350| year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, different-looking varieties may be nearly genetically identical, and differ only by a [[bud sport|bud mutation]].&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2005"&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/40/7/1963.full.pdf+html | title=The Search for the Authentic Citron (''Citrus medicus'' L.): Historic and Genetic Analysis | last1=Nicolosi | first1=Elisabetta | last2=La Malfi | first2=Stefano | last3=El-Otmani | first3=Mohamed | last4=Neghi | first4=Moshe | last5=Goldschmidt | first5=Eliezer E | journal=HortScience | volume = 40 | pages=1963–1968 | year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Detailed genomic analysis of wild and domesticated citrus cultivars has suggested that the progenitor of modern citrus species expanded out of the Himalayan foothills in a rapid radiation that has produced at least 10 wild species in South and East Asia and Australia.  Most commercial cultivars are the product of hybridization among these wild species, with most coming from crosses involving [[citron]]s, [[mandarin orange|mandarin]]s and [[pomelo]]s.&lt;ref name="Talon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genomics of the origin and evolution of ''Citrus'' | last1=Wu | first1=Guohong Albert | last2=Terol | first2=Javier | last3=Ibanez | first3=Victoria | last4=López-García | first4=Antonio | last5=Pérez-Román | first5=Estela | last6=Borredá | first6=Carles | last7=Domingo | first7=Concha | last8=Tadeo | first8=Francisco R | last9=Carbonell-Caballero | first9=Jose | last10=Alonso | first10=Roberto | last11=Curk | first11=Franck | last12=Du | first12=Dongliang | last13=Ollitrault | first13=Patrick | last14=Roose | first14=Mikeal L.

Most hybrids express different ancestral traits when planted from seeds ([[F2 hybrid]]s) and can continue a [[cloning|stable]] lineage only through [[vegetative propagation]].  Some hybrids do reproduce [[asexual reproduction|true to type]] via [[nucellar]] seeds in a process called [[apomixis]].&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;  As such, many hybrid species represent the clonal progeny of a single original F1 cross, though others combine fruit with similar characteristics that have arisen from distinct crosses.

==Genetic history==
[[File:Citrus tern cb simplified 1.svg|thumb|500px|right|Citrus fruits clustered by genetic similarity of partial sequences. [[Ternary diagram]] of hybrids of the three major ancestral species. Data from Curk et al. (2016).&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;]]

All of the wild 'pure' citrus species trace to a common ancestor that lived in the Himalayan foothills, where a late-[[Miocene]] citrus fossil, ''Citrus  linczangensis'', has been found.  At that time, a lessening of the [[monsoon]]s and resultant drier climate in the region allowed the citrus ancestor to expand across south and east Asia in a rapid genetic radiation.  After the plant crossed the [[Wallace line]] a second radiation took place in the early [[Pliocene]] (about 4 million years ago) to give rise to the Australian species.  Most modern cultivars are actually hybrids derived from a small number of 'pure' original species.  Though hundreds of species names have been assigned, a recent genomic study by Wu, ''et al.'' identified just ten ancestral species of citrus among those studied.  Of these, seven were native to Asia: pomelo (''Citrus maxima''), the 'pure' mandarins (''C. reticulata'' - most mandarin cultivars were hybrids of this species with pomelo), citrons (''C. medica''), [[Citrus micrantha|micranthas]] (''C. micrantha''), the [[Citrus ichangensis|Ichang papeda]] (''C. ichangensis''), the [[mangshanyegan]] (''C. mangshanensis''), and the oval (Nagami) [[kumquat]] (''Fortunella margarita'' or ''C. japonica'' var. ''margarita'').  In Australia three were identified: the [[Citrus glauca|desert lime]] (''C. glauca''), [[Citrus australis|round lime]] (''C. australis'') and the [[Citrus australasica|finger lime]] (''C. australasica''). Many other cultivars previously identified as species were found to be closely related variants ([[subspecies]] or [[variety (botany)|varieties]]) or hybrids of these species,&lt;ref name="Talon"/&gt; though not all cultivars were evaluated.

Interbreeding seems possible between all citrus plants, and between citrus plants and some plants which may or may not be categorized as citrus. The ability of [[citrus hybrids]] to self-pollinate and to reproduce sexually also helps create new varieties.  The three predominant ancestral citrus taxa are [[citron]] (''C. medica''), [[pomelo]] (''C. maxima''), and [[mandarin orange|mandarin]] (''C. reticulata'').&lt;ref name="Talon"/&gt;  These taxa interbreed freely, despite being quite genetically distinct, having arisen through [[allopatric speciation]], with citrons evolving in northern [[Indochina]], pomelos in the [[Malay Archipelago]], and mandarins in [[Vietnam]], [[southern China]], and [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="Curk"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-014-0152-1 | title=Next generation haplotyping to decipher nuclear genomic interspecific admixture in Citrus species: analysis of chromosome 2 | journal=BMC Genetics | volume=15 | page=152 | year=2014 | last1=Curk | first1=Franck | last2=Ancillo | first2=Gema | last3=Garcia-Lor | first3=Andres | last4=Luro | first4=François | last5=Perrier | first5=Xavier | last6=Jacquemoud-Collet | first6=Jean-Pierre | last7=Navarro | first7=Luis | last8=Ollitrault | first8=Patrick }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrids of these taxa include familiar citrus fruits like [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[grapefruit]], [[lemon]]s, [[Lime (fruit)|limes]], and some [[tangerine]]s.&lt;ref name=Moore/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0062574 | title=Phylogenetic Relationships of ''Citrus'' and Its Relatives Based on matK Gene Sequences | last1=Penjor | first1=Tshering | last2=Yamamoto | first2=Masashi | last3=Uehara | first3=Miki | last4=Ide | first4=Manami | last5=Matsumoto | first5=Natsumi | last6=Matsumoto | first6=Ryoji | last7=Nagano | first7=Yukio | journal=PLOS One | year=2013 | volume=8 | page=e62574 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0062574}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Citrons have also been hybridized with other citrus taxa, for example, crossed with micrantha to produce the [[Key lime]].&lt;ref name="Talon"/&gt;  In many cases, these crops are propagated [[apomixis|asexually]], and lose their characteristic traits if bred. However, some of these hybrids have interbred with one another and with the original taxa, making the citrus family tree a complicated network.

[[Kumquat|Kumquats]] do not naturally interbreed with core taxa due to different flowering times,&lt;ref name="Froelicher"&gt;{{cite journal |title=New universal mitochondrial PCR markers reveal new information on maternal citrus phylogeny |doi=10.1007/s11295-010-0314-x | volume=7 | journal=Tree Genetics &amp; Genomes |pages=49–61 | year=2011 | last1 = Froelicher | first1 = Yann | last2=Mouhaya | first2=Wafa | last3=Bassene | first3=Jean-Baptiste | last4=Costantino | first4=Gilles | last5=Kamiri | first5=Mourad | last6=Luro | first6=Francois | last7=Morillo | first7=Raphael | last8=Ollitrault | first8=Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; but hybrids (such as the [[calamondin]]) exist. [[Australian lime]]s are native to [[Australia]] and [[Papua New Guinea]], so they did not naturally interbreed with the core taxa, but they have been crossbred with [[mandarin orange|mandarins]] and [[calamondin]]s by modern breeders.  Humans have deliberately bred new citrus fruits by propagating seedlings of spontaneous crosses (e.g. [[clementines]]), creating or selecting mutations of hybrids, (e.g. [[Meyer lemon]]), and crossing different varieties (e.g. 'Australian Sunrise', a [[finger lime]] and [[calamondin]] cross).

Initially, many citrus types were identified and named by individual taxonomists, resulting in a large number of identified species: 870 by a 1969 count.&lt;ref name="Stone"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Citrus halimii: A New Species from Malaya and Peninsular Thailand | last1=Stone | first1=Benjamin C | last2=Lowry | first2=J Brian | last3=Scora | first3=R W | last4=Jong | first4=Kwiton | journal=Biotropica | volume=5 | pages=102–110 | year=1973 | doi=10.2307/2989659 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some order was brought to citrus taxonomy by two alternative unified classification schemes, those of [[Chōzaburō Tanaka]] and [[Walter Tennyson Swingle]], which can be viewed as extreme alternative visions of the same genus.&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  Swingle's system, divided the Citrinae subtribe into three groups, the 'primitive citrus' distant relatives, the closer 'near citrus' including citrus-related genera like ''[[Atalantia]]'', and the 'true citrus', which included ''Poncirus'', ''Citrus'', ''Fortunella'', ''Eremocitrus'', ''Microcitrus'', and ''Clymenia'', all but the first now viewed to fall within ''Citrus''.  His ''Citrus'' he likewise subdivided into two subgenera: citrons, pomelos, mandarins, oranges, grapefruits and lemons were placed in subgenus ''Eucitrus'' (later called simply subgenus ''Citrus''), while the hardy but slow-growing trees with relatively unpalatable fruit he placed in subgenus ''[[Papeda (citrus)|Papeda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wang | first=Xia, ''et al.'' | title=Genomic analyses of primitive, wild and cultivated citrus provide insights into asexual reproduction | journal=Nature Genetics | volume=49 | pages=765–772 | year=2017 | doi=10.1038/ng.3839}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Sharma | first1=Girish | last2=Sharma | first2=O.

Phylogenetic analysis confirms the hybrid origin of most citrus cultivars, indicating a small number of founder species.  While the subgenera suggested by Tanaka proved similar to the phylogenetic divisions, Swingle's subgenera were [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]],&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000"/&gt; and hence do not represent [[Valid name (zoology)|valid]] taxonomy.  Historical genera are also dubious.  Kumquats had been placed in a separate genus ''Fortunella'', while two genera were suggested by Swingle for the Australian limes, ''Microcitrus'' and ''Eremocitrus''.  However, genomic analysis has pointed to these groups nesting within the phylogenetic tree of the other citrus plants.  Since their placement in distinct genera would make ''Citrus'' a paraphyletic grouping, it has been suggested that all of these are correctly members of a single genus, ''Citrus''.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bayer&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bayer |first1=Randall J |last2=Mabberly | first2=David J | last3=Morton | first3=Cynthia | last4=Miller | first4=Cathy H. | last5=Sharma | first5=Ish K | last6=Pfiel | first6=Bernard E | last7=Rich | first7=Sarah | last8=Hitchcock | first8=Roberta | last9=Sykes | first9=Steve | year=2009 |title=A molecular phylogeny of the orange subfamily (Rutaceae: Aurantioideae) using nine cpDNA sequences.|journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=668–685 |doi=10.3732/ajb.0800341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, genomic analysis has suggested that other genera previously split off from ''Citrus'' may likewise belong within this expanded phylogenetic concept of the ''Citrus'' genus, including ''[[Clymenia (plant)|Clymenia]]'', ''[[Oxanthera]]'' and more controversially ''[[Poncirus]]'', along with a genus not previously recognized as a close citrus relative, ''[[Feroniella lucida|Feroniella]]''.&lt;ref name=Kubitzki&gt;{{cite chapter|last1=Kubitzki| first1=K.|last2=Kallinki|first2=J.

==Core species and hybrids==
{{see also|Folk taxonomy}}
Most commercial varieties are descended from one or more of the 'core species', [[citrons]], [[mandarin orange|mandarins]], and [[pomelos]], which share in common a complex floral anatomy that gives rise to more complex fruit.  These core species, and to a lesser extent other citrus, have given rise to a wide variety of hybrids for which the naming is inconsistent.  The same [[common name]]s may be given to different species, [[citrus hybrids]] or mutations. For example, citrus with green fruit tend to be called 'limes' independent of their origin: Australian limes, [[Calamondin|Musk limes]], [[Key lime]]s, [[kaffir lime]]s, [[Rangpur lime]]s, [[sweet lemon|sweet limes]] and [[wild lime]]s are all genetically distinct.  Fruit with similar ancestry may be quite different in name and traits (e.g. grapefruit, common oranges, and [[ponkan]]s, all pomelo-mandarin hybrids).  Many traditional citrus groups, such as true sweet oranges and lemons, seem to be [[bud sport]]s, clonal families of cultivars that have arisen from distinct spontaneous mutations of a single hybrid ancestor.&lt;ref name="Curk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;

===Ancestral species===
[[File:Mandarin Oranges (Citrus Reticulata).jpg|thumb|[[Mandarin orange]] is a true species, it is one of the progenitors of most cultivated [[citrus]].]]

====Mandarins====
[[Mandarin orange]]s (tangerines, satsumas - ''Citrus reticulata'') are one of the basic species, but the name mandarin is also used more generally for all small, easily peeled citrus, including a large range of hybrids.&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Genetic diversity and population structure analysis of mandarin germplasm by nuclear, chloroplastic and mitochondrial markers | last1=Garcia-Lor | first1=Andres | last2=Luro | first2=François | last3=Ollitrault | first3=Patrick | last4=Navarro | first4=Luis | journal=Tree Genetics &amp; Genomes | volume=11 | page=e123 | year=2015 | doi=10.1007/s11295-015-0951-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Swingle saw three species of mandarin, while Tanaka identified five groups with a total of 36 species. Webber (1948) divided them into four groups, king, satsuma, mandarin, and tangerine, and Hodgson (1967) saw in them four species.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity" /&gt;  Genomic analysis suggests just one species, ''Citrus reticulata'', with even the divergent [[Tachibana orange]] (Tanaka's ''Citrus tachibana''), native to Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands and southern Japan, nesting within the wild mandarins of the East-Asian mainland,&lt;ref name="Wang2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Lun, et al.|title=Genome of Wild Mandarin and Domestication History of Mandarin|journal=Molecular Plant|volume=11|number=8|pages=1024-1037|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and showing enough similarity to be considered just a [[subspecies]].&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  

All characterized varieties commercially called mandarins are [[mandarin orange#varieties|actually hybrids]].&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-29452005000200037&amp;script=sci_arttext | title=Genetic similarity of citrus fresh fruit market cultivars | last1=de Oliveira | first1=Roberto Pedroso | last2=Radmann | first2=Elizete Beatriz | journal=Revista Brasileira de Fruticultura | volume = 27 | year=2005 | pages=332–334 | doi=10.1590/S0100-29452005000200037}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wang, ''et al.'', found that domesticated mandarins fell into two genetic clusters that linked to different branches of the tree of wild mandarins, had different deduced population histories and had distinct patterns of pomelo introgression, suggesting that they derive from separate domestication events.&lt;ref name="Wang2018" /&gt;   Wu, ''et al.'', divided mandarins into three types, based on their degree of hybridization.  In addition to genetically pure mandarins, a second type are the result of hybridization with pomelos followed by subsequent [[backcrossing]] with mandarins to retain only a few pomelo traits.  The third type arose more recently from the crossing of these hybrids again with pomelos or sweet oranges (which are themselves crosses of hybrid mandarins and pomelos). This produces mandarins with more, longer stretches of pomelo DNA.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  Some commercial mandarins are hybrids with lemons, while several were found to have a significant contribution (35-65%) from papedas.&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity" /&gt;

Mangshan wild mandarin (''C. mangshanensis'') is a name used for the similar-looking wild mandarin-like fruit of the Mangshan area, but has been found to include two genetically-distinct groups, one representing pure, wild 'true' mandarins, and the other the genetically distinct and only distantly related [[mangshanyegan]], akin to another local fruit known as the 'yuanju',&lt;ref name="Wang2018" /&gt; and found to be the most distant branch of all the citrus.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;

In a limited genomic analysis, ''[[Feroniella]]'' was surprisingly found to cluster with ''C. reticulata'' deep within ''Citrus'',&lt;ref name=bayer /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabberley Feroniella" /&gt; leading botanist [[David Mabberley]] to propose that its sole member, ''F. lucida'', be rechristened ''C. lucida''.&lt;ref name=Kubitzki /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mabberley Feroniella" /&gt;

====Pomelos====
[[File:Citrus grandis - Honey White.jpg|thumb|The [[pomelo]].]]
The [[pomelo]] (''Citrus maxima''), a second of the core species from which most citrus hybrids have derived, is native to southeast Asia.  Among the hybrids deriving from mandarin/pomelo crosses, there is a direct correlation between the proportion of pomelo DNA in the hybrid and fruit size, while the more palatable mandarins are those that have received specific genes from pomelos that alter their acidity.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  Some of the more common pomelos are genetically pure, while a number have a single small region of [[introgression|introgressed]] mandarin DNA on one chromosome, the result of a cross followed by extensive backcrossing with pomelo.&lt;ref name="Oestlati"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oueslati|first1=Amel|last2=Salhi-Hannachi|first2=Amel|last3=Luro|first3=François|last4=Vignes|first4=Hélène|last5=Mournet|first5=Pierre|last6=Ollitrault|first6=Patrick|title=Genotyping by sequencing reveals the interspecific ''C. maxima'' / ''C. reticulata'' admixture along the genomes of modern citrus varieties of mandarins, tangors, tangelos, orangelos and grapefruits|journal=PLOS One|volume=12|p=e0185618|year=2017|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0185618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Citrons====
[[File:Citron (8448513463).jpg|thumb|These varieties of [[citron]], [[variety etrog|etrog]] and [[fingered citron|fingered]], have distinctly different appearances.]]
[[File:3 etrog.JPG|thumb|3 more varieties of ''Citrus medica'' that are all true non-hybrid [[citron]]s.]]
Varieties of true (non-hybrid) [[Citron]] (''Citrus medica'') have distinctly different forms.  The citron usually propagates by [[cleistogamy]], a [[self-pollination]] within an unopened flower, and this results in the lowest levels of hetero[[zygosity]] among the citrus species.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  Because of this, it will generally serve as the male parent of any hybrid progeny. Many [[Citron#Varieties &amp; hybrids|citron varieties]] were proven to be non-hybrids despite their rather dramatic morphological differences;&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/tjggcl5wyyu6l69d/ | title=Citrus phylogeny and genetic origin of important species as investigated by molecular markers | last1=Nicolosi | first1=E | last2=Deng | first2=Z.

Genetic analysis of citrons has shown that they divide into three groups.  One cluster consists of wild citrons that originated in China and produce non-fingered fruit with pulp and seeds. A second cluster, also native to China, consist of the fingered citrons, most of which are seedless and must be propagated artificially.  The third cluster represents the Mediterranean citrons, thought to have originally been introduced there from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Ramadugu | first1=Chandrika | last2=Keremane | first2=Manjunath L | last3=Hu | first3=Xulan | last4=Karp | first4=David | last5=Frederici | first5=Claire T | last6=Kahn | first6=Tracy | last7=Roose | first7=Mikeal L | last8=Lee | first8=Richard F. | title=Genetic analysis of citron (''Citrus medica'' L.) using simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms | journal=Scientia Horticulturae | volume=195 | pages=124–137 | year=2015 | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304423815301692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[fingered citron]] varieties are used in [[buddhist offering]]s, and some more common varieties are used as the [[etrog]] in the Jewish harvest festival of [[Sukkot]].  There is also a specific variety of citron called [[Greek citron|etrog]]. The [[Mountain citron]] is a complex citrus hybrid that only includes trace amounts of true citron.&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity" /&gt;

====Kumquats====
[[Kumquats]] are a separate species, with few hybrids.  [[Carl Peter Thunberg]] originally classified the [[kumquat]]s as ''Citrus japonica'' in his 1784 book, ''[[Flora Japonica (1784 book)|Flora Japonica]]''. In 1915, Swingle reclassified them in a separate genus, ''[[Fortunella (plant)|Fortunella]]'', named in honor of [[Robert Fortune]]. Seven species of ''Fortunella'' were generally recognized—''F. japonica'', ''F. margarita'', ''F. crassifolia'', ''F. hindsii'', ''F. obovata'' and ''F. polyandra'', as well as the recently described ''F. bawangica''. Since the kumquat is a [[cold hardy citrus|cold hardy species]], there are many hybrids between common citrus members and the kumquat. Swingle coined a separate hybrid genus for these, which he called ''[[× Citrofortunella]]''.

Subsequent study of the many commercial citrus lineages revealed such complexity that the genera could not be separated,&lt;ref name="Mabberley 2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last=[[David Mabberley|Mabberley]] | first= D. J. | journal=Blumea | volume=49 | pages=481–498 | year=2004 | title=''Citrus'' (Rutaceae): A Review of Recent Advances in Etymology, Systematics and Medical Applications | url=http://repository.naturalis.nl/document/565086}}&lt;/ref&gt; and genomic analysis rooted ''Fortunella'' within the polyphyletic tree of ''Citrus''.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=bayer /&gt; Consequently, in accordance with the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], the [[correct name (botany)|correct]] genus name reverted to ''Citrus''. [[Flora of China (journal)|''The Flora of China'']] unites all kumquats as the single species, ''Citrus japonica''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Zhang | first1=Dianxiang |last2=Hartley | first2=Thomas G. | last3=Mabberley | first3=David J. |title=Rutaceae | work=Flora of China | volume=11 |pages=51–97 | year=2008 | url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=10781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Papedas====
Swingle coined the [[Papeda (citrus)|''Citrus'' subgenus ''Papeda'']] to separate its members from the more edible citrus, that also differ from other citrus in that its stamens grow separately, not united at the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A classification for edible Citrus (Rutaceae) |last=Mabberley | first=David | journal=Telopea | volume=7 | pages=167–172 | year=1997 | url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/b4c6/39c322765afb2d03a9a7f3f5fd1f3ac1c250.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He included in this group the [[kaffir lime]], as well as the Ichang papeda (''Citrus ichangensis'') and the micrantha (''Citrus micrantha'').  Since the latter two species locate to different branches of the citrus phylogenetic tree, the group would be [[polyphyly|polyphyletic]] and not a valid division.&lt;ref name="nuclear phylogenetic"&gt;{{cite journal | title=A nuclear phylogenetic analysis: SNPs, indels and SSRs deliver new insights into the relationships in the ‘true citrus fruit trees’ group (Citrinae, Rutaceae) and the origin of cultivated species | last1=Garcia-Lor |first1=Andres | last2=Curk | first2=Franck | last3=Snoussi-Trifa | first3=Hager | last4=Morillon | first4=Raphael | last5=Ancillo | first5=Gema | last6=Luro | first6=François | last7=Navarro | first7=Luis | last8=Ollitrault | first8=Patrick | journal=Annals of Botany | volume=111 | pages=1–19 | year=2011 | doi=10.1093/aob/mcs227| pmc=3523644 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000" /&gt;  Papedas have also given rise to hybrids with other citrus.

====Australian and New Guinean species====
[[File:Citrus glauca fruit.jpg|thumb|The [[desert lime]], ''[[Citrus glauca]]'', hangs from a branch.]]
[[Australian lime|Australian and New Guinean citrus species]] had been viewed as belonging to separate genera by Swingle, who placed in ''Microcitrus'' all but the desert lime, for whcih he used ''[[Eremocitrus]]''.  However, genomic analysis shows that though they form a distinct clade from other citrus, this is nested within the citrus phylogenetic tree, most closely related to kumquats, suggesting that all these species should be included in the genus ''Citrus''.&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  Wu, ''et al.'', found that several of the finger lime cultivars were actually hybrids with round lime, and concluded there were just three species among those tested, [[Citrus glauca|desert lime]] (''C. glauca''), [[Citrus australis|round lime]] (''C. australis'') and the [[Citrus australasica|finger lime]] (''C. australasica''), though their analysis did not include other types previously identified as distinct species.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;  In more limited genomic analysis, the [[New Guinea wild lime]], ''[[Clymenia (plant)|Clymenia]]'' and ''[[Oxanthera]]'' (false orange) all cluster with the Australian limes as members of ''Citrus''.&lt;ref name=bayer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Towards a molecular taxonomic key of the Aurantioideae subfamily using chloroplastic SNP diagnostic markers of the main clades genotyped by competitive allele-specific PCR | last1=Oueslati | first1=Amel | last2=Ollitrault | first2=Frederique | last3=Baraket | first3=Ghada | last4=Salhi-Hannachi | first4=Amel | last5=Navarro | first5=Luis | last6=Ollitrault | first6=Patrick | journal=BMC Genetics | volume=17 | page=118 | year=2016 | doi=10.1186/s12863-016-0426-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The outback lime is a desert lime agriculturally-selected for more commercial traits, while [[Australian lime#Cultivars|Some commercial varieties]] of the Australian lime are hybrids with mandarins, lemons, and/or sweet oranges.  ''Clymenia'', will hybridize with [[kumquat]]s and some [[lime (fruit)|limes]].

== Genetic hybrids==
'''Citrus hybrids''' include many [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] and [[species]] that have been selected by [[plant breeding|plant breeders]]. This is done not only for the useful characteristics of the fruit, but also for plant size and growth characteristics such as cold-tolerance. Some citrus [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] occurred naturally, and others have been deliberately created, either by [[cross pollination]] and selection among the progeny, or (rarely, and only recently) as [[somatic hybrid]]s. The aim of plant breeding of hybrids is to use two or more different citrus varieties or species, in order to get traits intermediate between those of the parents, or to transfer individual desirable traits of one parent into the other. In some cases, particularly with the natural hybrids, it has been viewed as [[hybrid speciation]] and the new plants have been viewed as different species from any of their parents. Citrus hybrids have often been given unique [[hybrid name (botany)|hybrid names]], marked with a [[multiplication sign]] after the word "Citrus", for example the Key lime is ''Citrus'' × ''aurantifolia'', and also are referred to by joining the names of the crossed species or hybrids that produced them, as with [[sunquat]] – ''Citrus limon'' × ''japonica''. Styling a hybrid as such a cross between two species can present challenges.  In some cases the parental species that gave rise to a hybrid have yet to be determined, while genotyping reveals some hybrids to descend from three or more ancestral species.

===Labelling of hybrids===
Hybrid taxonomy is inconsistent.  There is disagreement over whether to assign species names to hybrids, and even modern hybrids of known parentage are sold under general names that give little information about their ancestry, or even give technically incorrect information.

===Major citrus hybrids===
[[File:OrangeBloss wb.jpg|thumb|right|The [[orange (fruit)|common orange]]s as well as the [[grapefruit]]s are hybrids between the [[Mandarin orange|mandarin]] and the [[pomelo]].]]
[[File:Castello, collezione degli agrumi 02.jpg|thumb|upright|A variety of [[lumia (citrus)|Lumia]]]]
The most common citrus hybrids that are sometimes treated as a [[species]] by themselves, especially in [[folk taxonomy]], are:
* [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]]: a name used for several distinct crosses between [[pomelo]] and a [[mandarin orange]].  They have the [[orange (color)|orange color]] of the mandarin in their outer peels and segments, and are easier to peel than the pomelos.  Oranges are all intermediate between the two ancestors in size, flavor and shape.&lt;ref name=Wu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |
 last=Xu | first=Qiang, ''et al.'' | url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n1/full/ng.2472.html | title=The draft genome of sweet orange (''Citrus sinensis'') | journal=Nature Genetics | volume=45 | pages=59–66 | year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[sour orange]] and [[sweet orange]] both arose from mandarin-pomelo crosses, the former involving a pure mandarin, the latter with a mandarin already containing small amounts of pomelo.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;
* [[Grapefruit]]: Grapefruits, like oranges, include genetic contributions from both mandarin and pomelo, but more of the latter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1016332030738|title=Assessment of genetic variability in grapefruits (''Citrus paradisi'' Macf.) and pomelos (''C. maxima'' (Burm.) Merr.) using RAPD and SSR markers | doi=10.1023/A:1016332030738 | volume=126|journal=Euphytica|pages=169–176 | last1 = Corazza-Nunes | first1 = M.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; arising from a natural backcross of a sweet orange with a pomelo.&lt;ref name="Oestlati" /&gt;  The 'cocktail grapefruit', or [[Mandelo]], is distinct, instead the product of a low-acid pomelo variety hybridized with a mandarin that itself was a cross between two distinct mandarin stocks.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;
* [[Lemon]]: 'true' lemons derive from one common hybrid ancestor, having diverged by mutation. The original lemon was a hybrid between a male citron and a female sour orange, itself a pomelo/pure-mandarin hybrid; citrons contribute half of the genome, while the other half is divided between pomelo and mandarin.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;&lt;ref name=gulsen&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/126/3/309.full.pdf | title=Lemons: Diversity and Relationships with Selected Citrus Genotypes as Measured with Nuclear Genome Markers | last1=Gulson | first1=O. | last2=Roose | first2=M. L. | journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science | volume=126 | pages=309–317 | year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are other hybrids also known as 'lemons'.  [[Rough lemon]]s arose from a cross between citron and mandarin, without the pomelo contribution found in true lemons, while the [[Meyer lemon]] comes from a citron crossed with a sweet (as opposed to sour) orange.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Phylogenetic origin of limes and lemons revealed by cytoplasmic and nuclear markers | last1=Curk | first1=Franck | last2=Ollitrault | first2= Frédérique | last3=Garcia-Lor | first3= Andres | last4=Luro | first4=François | last5=Navarro | first5=Luis | last6=Ollitrault | first6=Patrick | journal=Annals of Botany | volume=11 | pages=565–583 | year=2016 | doi=10.1093/aob/mcw005 | pmc=4817432 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lime (fruit)|Limes]]: A highly diverse group of hybrids go by this name.  [[Rangpur (fruit)|Rangpur limes]], like rough lemons, arose from crosses between citron and mandarin.  The [[sweet lemon|sweet limes]], so-called due to their low acid pulp and juice, come from crosses of citron with either sweet or sour oranges, while the Key lime arose from a cross between a citron and a micrantha.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;

All of these hybrids have in turn been bred back with their parent stocks or with other pure or hybrid citrus to form a broad array of fruits.  Naming of these is inconsistent, with some bearing a variant of the name of one of the parents or simply another citrus with superficially-similar fruit, a distinct name, or a [[portmanteau]] of ancestral species.  The [[Ponderosa lemon]] (''Citrus limon'' × ''medica'') and [[Florentine citron]] (''Citrus x limonimedica'') are both true lemon/citron hybrids, the [[Bergamot orange]] is a sweet orange/lemon hybrid and the [[Oroblanco]] is a grapefruit/pomelo mix, while [[tangelo]]s are tangerine (mandarin)/pomelo or mandarin/grapefruit hybrids, [[orangelo]]s result from grapefruit backcrossed with sweet orange, and a sweet orange backcrossed with a tangerine gives the [[tangor]].&lt;ref name="Oestlati" /&gt;  One [[Lumia (citrus)|lumia]], a member of the [[sweet lemon]]s, is the product of crossing a lemon with a pomelo/citron hybrid, though another lumia variety, the [[Lumia (citrus)#Pomum Adami|Pomme d'Adam]], is a micrantha/citron cross, like the Key lime.  The most common and commercially popular 'limes', the [[Persian lime]]s, are Key lime/lemon hybrids that combine the genetic lineages of four ancestral citrus species: mandarin, pomelo, citron and micrantha.&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;

While most other citrus are [[ploidy|diploid]], many of the Key lime hybrid progeny have unusual chromosome numbers.  For example, the Persian lime is [[Polyploid|triploid]], deriving from a diploid Key lime [[gamete]] and a haploid lemon [[ovule]].  A second group of Key lime hybrids, including the Tanepao lime and Madagascar lemon, are also triploid but instead seem to have arisen from a backcross of a diploid Key lime ovule with a citron haploid gamete.  The 'Giant Key lime' owes its increased size to a spontaneous duplication of the entire diploid Key lime genome to produce a [[Polyploid|tetraploid]].&lt;ref name="limes and lemons" /&gt;

Historically, hybrids with similar characteristics have been placed together in a number of hybrid species, yet relatively recent genomic analysis has revealed some hybrids assigned to the same species to be of quite distinct ancestry.  No alternative system of grouping fruit in hybrid species has been adopted.

===Hybrids from other citrus species===
While most citrus hybrids derive from the three core species, hybrids have also been derived from the [[Citrus micrantha|micrantha]], the [[Citrus ichangensis|Ichang papeda]] and the [[kumquat]].  The best known hybrid from micrantha is the [[Key lime]] (or Mexican lime), derived from the breeding of a male citron and a female micrantha.  Several citrus varieties are Ichang papeda/mandarin crosses (for which Swingle coined the term ichandarin&lt;ref name="Shimuzu" /&gt;), including [[Sudachi]] and [[Yuzu]] (which also includes smaller contributions from pomelo and kumquat).&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity" /&gt;  Other more exotic citrus have likewise proved hybrids that include papeda.  For example, the [[Indian wild orange]], once suggested as a possible ancestor of today's cultivated citrus fruits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Malik | first1=S. K. |last2=Chaudhury | first2=R. | last3=Dhariwal | first3=O. P. | last4=kalia | first4=R. K. | year=2006 | url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10722-005-7468-7#page-2 | title=Collection and characterization of ''Citrus indica'' Tanaka and ''C. macroptera'' Montr.: wild endangered species of northeastern India | journal=Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution | volume=53 | pages=1485–1493 }}&lt;/ref&gt; yielded conflicting phylogenetic placements in more limited genetic analysis,&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/123/4/612.full.pdf |title=Phylogenetic Relationships among Selected ''Citrus'' Germplasm Accessions Revealed by Inter-simple Sequence Repeat Markers |last1=Fang | first1=Dequi | last2=Krueger | first2=Robert R | last3=Roose | first3=Mikeal L | journal=Journal of the American Society for Horticultural Science | volume=123 | pages=612–617| year=1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but study of nuclear markers and chloroplast DNA showed it to be of maternal citron lineage, with further genetic contributions from mandarin and papeda.&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity" /&gt;  The wild Mountain citron, native to the Malay peninsula and called ''[[Citrus halimii]]'' at the time of its discovery,&lt;ref name="Stone" /&gt; has been found to be a complex mix, being half papeda (type not specified), the other half including kumquat, mandarin and pomelo, with only trace amounts of citron.&lt;ref name="Genetic Diversity" /&gt;

====Citrofortunella====
A large group of commercial hybrids involve the [[kumquat]], ''Fortunella'' in the Swingle system.  ''[[Citrofortunella]]'' was coined as a genus containing intergeneric hybrids between members of the ''Citrus'' and the ''Fortunella'', and is named after its parent genera.&lt;ref name=Ingram&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Ingram | first1=J. | last2=Moore | first2= H. e. | title=Rutaceae | journal = Baileya | volume=19 | year=1976 | pages=169–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such hybrids often combine the cold hardiness of the ''Fortunella'' with some edibility properties of the ''Citrus'' species.  As members of a hybrid genus, Citrofortunellas were marked with the multiplication sign before the genus name, for example [[calamondin|× ''Citrofortunella microcarpa'']].  With the placement of kumquats within ''Citrus'', Citrofortunella are no longer viewed as being intergeneric hybrids.  All likewise belong in ''Citrus'', while ''Citrofortunella'' as a distinct genus name would no longer be [[Valid name (zoology)|valid]].&lt;ref name="Mabberley 2004" /&gt;  Examples of the Citrofortunella include the [[calamondin]], [[limequat]] and [[yuzuquat]], crossing kumquat with [[tangerine]], [[Key lime]] and [[yuzu]] respectively.

==Graft hybrids==
[[File:Citrus_aurantium_"bizzarria"_frutto_acerbo.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bizzaria]], an unusual graft-chimera.]]
Due to the sterility of many of the genetic hybrids as well as disease- or temperature-sensitivity of some ''Citrus'' trees, domesticated citrus cultivars are usually propagated via grafting to the rootstock of other, often hardier though less palatable citrus or close relatives.  As a result, graft hybrids, also called [[graft-chimaera]]s, can occur in ''Citrus''.  After [[grafting]], the [[cell (biology)|cells]] from the [[Grafting|scion]] and [[rootstock]] are not [[somatic fusion|somatically fused]], but rather the cells of the two intermix at the graft site, and can produce shoots bearing fruit with a combination of the characteristics of the two contributing species due to the presence of cells from both.  In an extreme example, on separate branches [[Bizzaria]] produces fruit identical to each of the two contributing species, but also fruit at the junction that appears to be half one species and half the other, unmixed.  Graft hybrids are distinguished from genetic hybrids by designating the two contributing species with a '+' between the individual names (''Citrus medica'' + ''C. aurantium'').

==Citrus relatives==
===Trifoliate orange===
[[File:Poncirusfruits2001HD.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Trifoliate orange]] belongs to the genus ''[[Poncirus]]'', according to [[Walter Tennyson Swingle|Swingle]].]]
The [[trifoliate orange]] is a [[cold hardy citrus|cold hardy plant]] distinguishable by its [[Leaf#Divisions of the blade|compound leaves]] with three leaflets and its deciduous nature, but is close enough to the genus ''Citrus'' to be used as a rootstock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-59609-4_15|chapter=Genetic Transformation of ''Poncirus trifoliata'' (Trifoliate Orange)| last1=Kaneyoshi | first1=J. | last2=Kobayashi | first2=S. | title=Transgenic Trees | series= Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry  | volume=44 | pages=212–220 | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Swingle moved the trifoliate orange from ''Citrus'' to its own [[genus]], ''[[Poncirus]]''.  It was long thought to be the only member of this genus, until a second species, ''Poncirus polyandra'', was discovered in [[Yunnan]] ([[People's Republic of China|China]]) in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="nuclear phylogenetic" /&gt;  Early phylogenetic analysis nested ''Poncirus'' within the citrus, suggesting they all belong to a single genus,&lt;ref name="Nicolosi 2000" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1439609204700537 | doi=10.1078/1439-6092-00058 | title=What is Citrus? Taxonomic implications from a study of cp-DNA evolution in the tribe Citreae (Rutaceae subfamily Aurantioideae) | last1=de Araújo | first1=Edson Freitas |last2=Queiroza | first2=Luciano Paganuccide | last3=Machado |first3=Marcos Antônio  | year=2003 | volume= 1 | pages=55–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bayer /&gt;&lt;ref name="nuclear phylogenetic" /&gt; but the genomic sequencing of Wu, ''et al.'', placed it outside the cluster representing ''Citrus'', and the authors retained a separate ''Poncirus'' genus.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;

====''Citroncirus''====
As with kumquats, the trifoliate orange does not naturally interbreed with core taxa due to different flowering times,&lt;ref name="Froelicher" /&gt; but hybrids have been produced artificially between ''Poncirus'' and members of the genus ''Citrus''. In the Swingle system the name coined for these intra-generic crosses, represented as a hybrid genus, is "× ''Citroncirus''".  The group includes the [[citrange]], a hybrid between the trifoliate and [[sweet orange]]s, and the [[citrumelo]], a hybrid of trifoliate orange and 'Duncan' [[grapefruit]].  Were ''Poncirus'' to be subsumed into ''Citrus'', these hybrids would no longer be intergeneric, and would all likewise fall within ''Citrus''.

'''Comedy of menace''' is the body of plays written by [[David Campton]], [[Nigel Dennis]], [[N. F. Simpson]], and [[Harold Pinter]].  The term was coined by drama critic [[Irving Wardle]], who borrowed it from the subtitle of Campton's play ''[[The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace]]'', in reviewing Pinter's and Campton's plays in ''[[Encore (magazine)|Encore]]'' in 1958.  (Campton's subtitle ''Comedy of Menace'' is a jocular play-on-words derived from ''[[comedy of manners]]''—''menace'' being ''manners'' pronounced with somewhat of a Judeo-English accent.)&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;See Merritt 5, 9–10, 225–28, 240, 310, and 326, citing articles by Wardle, Gussow's ''Conversations with Pinter'', and various performance reviews by Wardle, Gussow, and others.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Citing Wardle's original publications in ''Encore'' magazine (1958), Susan Hollis Merritt points out that in "Comedy of Menace" Wardle "first applies this label to Pinter's work … describ[ing] Pinter as one of 'several playwrights who have been tentatively lumped together as the "non-naturalists" or "abstractionists"&amp;nbsp;' (28)" (Merritt 225).  His article "Comedy of Menace," Merritt continues,
&lt;blockquote&gt;centers on ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' because it is the only play of Pinter's that Wardle had seen [and reviewed] at the time, yet he speculates on the basis of "descriptions of [Pinter's] other plays, '[[The Room (play)|The Room]]' and '[[The Dumb Waiter]]', [that Pinter] is a writer dogged by one image—the womb" (33).  Mentioning the acknowledged "literary influences" on Pinter's work—"Beckett, Kafka and American gangster films"—Wardle argues that "&amp;nbsp;'The Birthday Party' exemplifies the type of comic menace which gave rise to this article." (225)&lt;ref&gt;[[Cf.]] Billington 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "Comedy of Menace", as Merritt observes, on the basis of his experience of ''The Birthday Party'' and others' accounts of the other two plays, Wardle proposes that "Comedy enables the committed agents and victims of destruction to come on and off duty; to joke about the situation while oiling a revolver; to display absurd or endearing features behind their masks of implacable resolution; to meet … in paper hats for a game of blind man's buff"; he suggests how "menace" in Pinter's plays "stands for something more substantial: destiny," and that destiny, "handled in this way—not as an austere exercise in classicism, but as an incurable disease which one forgets about most of the time and whose lethal reminders may take the form of a joke—is an apt dramatic motif for an age of conditioned behaviour in which orthodox man is a willing collaborator in his own destruction" (Wardle, "Comedy of Menace" 33; rpt. in ''The Encore Reader'' 91).

"Just two years later" (1960), however, Wardle retracted "Comedy of Menace" in his review of ''[[The Caretaker]]'', stating: "On the strength of 'The Birthday Party' and the pair of one-acters, I rashly applied the phrase 'comedy of menace' to Pinter's writing.  I now take it back" ("There's Music" 130, as qtd. in Merritt 225–26).

After Wardle's retraction of ''comedy of menace'' as he had applied it to Pinter's writing, Pinter himself also occasionally disavowed it and questioned its relevance to his work (as he  also did with his own offhand but apt statement that his plays are about "the weasel under the cocktail cabinet").  For example, in December 1971, in his interview with Pinter about ''[[Old Times]]'', [[Mel Gussow]] recalled that "After ''[[The Homecoming]]'' [Pinter] said that [he] 'couldn't any longer stay in the room with this bunch of people who opened doors and came in and went out.  ''[[Landscape]]'' and ''[[Silence]]'' [the two short poetic memory plays that were written between ''The Homecoming'' and ''Old Times''] are in a very different form.  There isn't any menace at all.'&amp;nbsp;"  Later, when Gussow asked Pinter to expand on his view that he had "tired" of "menace", Pinter added: "when I said that I was tired of menace, I was using a word that I didn't coin.  I never thought of menace myself.  It was called 'comedy of menace' quite a long time ago [1958].  I never stuck categories on myself, or on any of us [playwrights].  But if what I understand the word menace to mean is certain elements that I have employed in the past in the shape of a particular play, then I don't think it's worthy of much more exploration" (Gussow, ''Conversations with Pinter'' 18, 24).

Despite Wardle's retraction of ''comedy of menace'' (and Pinter's later qualifications), ''Comedy of menace'' and ''comedies of menace'' caught on and have been prevalent since the late 1950s in advertisements and in critical accounts, notices, and reviews to describe Pinter's early plays and some of his later work as well.&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;  As Merritt points out, among other examples of critics' usage of this and similar categories of Pinter's work, after Gussow's 1971 "conversation" with Pinter, "Though he echoes Wardle's concept, Gussow seems to avoid using ''comedy of menace'' when reviewing the CSC Repertory Theatre's 1988 production of ''The Birthday Party''.  While still emphasizing Pinter's 'terrors' and the 'shiver beneath the laughter,' Gussow describes the play as 'a play of intrigue, with an underlying motif of betrayal' … [and] [Bernard F.] Dukore calls the play 'a comedy (of menace or otherwise)' … (Merritt 10).

==Selected examples from Pinter's plays and sketches==
&lt;!--See Wikified links to articles on the plays for further details and interpretations of their elements of comedy and menace and critical references.--&gt;
;''The Birthday Party'' (1958)

In discussing the first production of Pinter's first full-length play, ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' (1958), which followed his first play, ''[[The Room (play)|The Room]]'' (1957), his authorised official biographer [[Michael Billington (critic)|Michael Billington]] points out that Wardle "once excellently" described its setting (paraphrasing Wardle), as "a banal living-room [which] opens up to the horrors of modern history" (Billington 86).

;''The Dumb Waiter'' (1960)

In his second one-act play, ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]'' (1960), as accentuated through the 2008 film by [[Martin McDonagh]] closely resembling and markedly influenced by it, ''[[In Bruges]]'', "Pinter conveys the idea of political terror through the staccato rhythms of [[music hall|music-hall]] cross-talk and the urban thriller: [[Hackney Empire]] cross-fertilises with [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Killers (Hemingway short story)|The Killers]]'' [1927]" (Billington 90), one of Pinter's own acknowledged early influences, along with [[Franz Kafka]] (348–49); Elizabethan and Jacobean dramatists, such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Webster]], and [[Cyril Tourneur]], whose work his schoolmaster Joseph Brearley had introduced to him; [[Samuel Beckett]] (mostly his novels [43]); and black-and-white American movies of the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref name=WardleinMerritt&gt;See Wardle, "Comedy of Menace" 33, as qtd. in Merritt 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

"A near-perfect play about the testiness of a collapsing partnership and the divide-and-rule tactics of authority," according to Billington, ''The Dumb Waiter'' focuses on two characters, Gus and Ben; Gus is "the man who questions the agreed system and who is ultimately destroyed by his quest for meaning"; Ben, "the man who blindly obeys orders and thereby places himself at risk.  (If the system can arbitrarily dispose of his partner, why not of him?)" (92).  As Pinter's ''The Dumb Waiter'' has been categorised as a "comedy of menace," so may be  McDonagh's ''In Bruges'', as it closely resembles it; yet, despite the comedy and the sense of threat growing out of the menace, these works of Pinter and McDonagh are, in Pinter's words to Billington, also "doing something which can be described as political" (92).  At the same time, [Pinter] had – and still [in 1996 through to the time of his death in 2008] has – an acute sense of the fragility of earthly happiness and of the terrors that haunt us even from infancy" (92).

The "punning title" of ''The Dumb Waiter'', Billington observes, "carries several layers of meaning": "It obviously refers to the antique serving-hatch that despatches [sic] ever more grotesque orders for food to these bickering gunmen"—the [[dumbwaiter (elevator)|dumbwaiter]]; "But it also applies to Gus, who, troubled by the nature of the mission [their next job as hitmen] to realise he is its chosen target; or, indeed to Ben, who, by his total obedience to a higher authority that forces him to eliminate his partner, exposes his own vulnerability" (89).  As Gus "dumbly" awaits his fate, he may be a subservient partner who awaits orders from the "senior partner" Ben, but Ben too is subservient to [[The powers that be (phrase)|The Powers That Be]], a contemporary variation on [[Deus ex machina]], manipulating both the mechanical dumbwaiter and them through its increasingly extravagant and thus comically inconvenient "orders" for increasingly exotic dishes, unnerving both of them.

Billington adds:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This being Pinter, the play has a metaphorical openness.  You can interpret it as an [[Theatre of the absurd|Absurdist comedy]] – a kind of ''[[Waiting for Godot|Godot]]'' in [[Birmingham]] – about two men passing the time in a universe without meaning or purpose.  You can see it as a cry of protest against a whimsically cruel God who treats man as His plaything – even the twelve matches that are mysteriously pushed under the door have been invested with religious significance [by critics].  But it makes much more sense if seen as a play about the dynamics of power and the nature of partnership.  Ben and Gus are both victims of some unseen authority ''and'' a surrogate married couple quarrelling, testing, [[talking past each other]] and raking over old times. (90)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The comedy in this "comedy of menace" often derives from such arguments between Gus and Ben, especially the one that occurs when "Ben tells Gus to go and light the kettle," a "semantic nit-picking that is a standard part of music-hall comedy": "All the great stage and film double acts – [[Jimmy Jewel|Jewel]] and [[Ben Warriss|Warriss]], [[Abbott and Costello]] – fall into this kind of verbal worrying in which the bullying 'male' straight man issues instructions which are questioned by the more literal-minded 'female' partner" —
&lt;blockquote&gt;
GUS: Light what?&lt;br&gt;
BEN: The kettle.&lt;br&gt;
GUS: You mean the gas.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: Who does?&lt;br&gt;
GUS: You do.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: (''his eyes narrowing''): What do you mean, I mean the gas?&lt;br&gt;
GUS: Well, that's what you mean, don't you? The gas.&lt;br&gt;
BEN: (''Powerfully''): If I say go and light the kettle I mean go and light the kettle.&lt;br&gt;
GUS: How can you light a kettle?&lt;br&gt;
BEN: It's a figure of speech! Light the kettle.  It's a figure of speech! (Qtd. in Billington 90–91)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As Billington observes further,
&lt;blockquote&gt;This kind of comic pedantry has precise echoes of the great [[Sid Field]] – ironically [since the city is the setting of this play] a Birmingham comic – who had a famous sketch in which he played a virgin of the greens being hectored by [[Jerry Desmonde]]'s golf pro who would cry, in exasperation, 'When I say "Slowly Back" I don't mean "Slowly Back", I mean "Slowly Back."&amp;nbsp;' At another moment, the bullying pro would tell the hapless Sid to get behind the ball and he would vainly protest 'But it's behind all round it'. But, where in a music-hall sketch this kind of semantic by-play was its own justification, in Pinter it becomes a crucial part of the power-structure.  … The pay-off comes when Gus, having dogmatically insisted that the accurate phrase is 'put on the kettle', suddenly finds an irritated Ben adopting the right usage. (91)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Everything" in ''The Dumb Waiter'', Billington observes, "contributes towards a necessary end"; for, "the image, as Pete says in [Pinter's only novel] ''[[The Dwarfs (novel)|The Dwarfs]]'', stands in exact correspondence and relation to the idea" (91).  In this example, the central image and central metaphor, the dumbwaiter, while "despatching ever more unlikely orders," serves as "both a visual gag and a metaphor for manipulative authority" (91), and therein lies its menace.  When Ben instructs Gus verbally, while practicing their "routine" for killing their next victim, he leaves out the most important line, which instructs Gus to "take out" his "gun" (Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 114–15):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"BEN ''frowns and presses his forehead''.&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  You've missed something out.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  I know.  What?&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  I haven't taken my gun out, according to you.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  You take your gun out—&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  After I've closed the door.&lt;br&gt;
BEN.  After you've closed the door.&lt;br&gt;
GUS.  You've never missed that out before, you know that?&lt;br&gt;
(Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 116)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The crucial significance of the omission becomes clear only at the very end of the play, when "Gus enters through the door stage-right – the one marked for the intended victim – stripped of his gun and holster"; it becomes clear that ''he'' is going to be "Ben's target" (Billington 92), as Ben's "''revolver [is] levelled at the door''", though the play ends ''before'' Ben fires any shot (Pinter, ''The Dumb Waiter'' 121).

;''The Caretaker'' (1960)

In an entry on Pinter for the 1969 edition of ''[[The Encyclopedia of World Drama]]'' cited by Merritt, Wardle repeats and updates some of his first perspective on ''comedy of menace'' as he had applied it initially to Pinter's writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Early in his writing career Pinter admitted to three influences: [[Franz Kafka]], American gangster films, and [[Samuel Beckett]]. . . . At that time his plays, more than those of any other plawright's {{sic}}, were responsible for the newly coined term 'comedy of menace.'  This phrase certainly makes sense when applied to ''[[The Birthday Party (play)|The Birthday Party]]'' . . . or to ''[[The Dumb Waiter]]''. . . . But 'menace' is hardly the word for ''[[The Caretaker]]'', and still less for subsequent plays in which Pinter increasingly exchanged his derelict settings and down-and-out characters for environments of moneyed elegance (657–58).  (Qtd. in Merritt 240)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite those more-recent caveats regarding applying the phrase that he himself initially coined for Pinter's writing to ''The Caretaker''—only the second of Pinter's full-length plays produced by then and the one that launched his career as a successful playwright in 1960 (Merritt 9, 226) —and to Pinter's later plays, scenes in both acts of ''The Caretaker'' in which Mick confronts an unsuspecting Davies and scares him almost speechless (Pinter, ''The Caretaker'' 129, 146) also epitomise how comedy and menace still co-exist in Pinter's text and on Pinter's stage.

The comic aspects of this play multiply, reaching a crescendo in Mick's monologue in Act Two describing his "deepest wishes" for decorating the attic room (161, 173) and falling with Davies, a tramp taken in out of the cold by his brother, suggesting that "if" he can "just get down to Sidcup" to get his "papers" and "sort" himself "out" (113–16, 164), his refrain and excuse for everything (153, 175–79), he might just be able to accomplish Mick's hyperbolic pipe dream and "decorate the attic room out for [Mick]" (164), leading Mick to accuse Davies of misrepresenting himself as "an experienced first-class professional interior and exterior decorator" (172–74), an absurd conclusion, given the tangible evidence of the down-and-out Davies before Mick (and the audience).

Pinter's friend the late film and stage director [[David Jones (director)|David Jones]], who directed the play for the [[Roundabout Theatre]], in [[New York City]], in 2003 (having previously directed Pinter's 1983 film of ''[[Betrayal (1983 film)|Betrayal]]'', as well as other works by or featuring him), reminds his audience that Pinter himself said, in a widely quoted statement, that ''The Caretaker'' is only "funny, up to a point" and that "beyond that point" is why he wrote it:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is always mischief lurking in the darkest corners. The world of The Caretaker is a bleak one, its characters damaged and lonely. But they are all going to survive. And in their dance to that end they show a frenetic vitality and a wry sense of the ridiculous that balance heartache and laughter. Funny, but not too funny. As Pinter wrote, back in 1960: "As far as I am concerned The Caretaker IS funny, up to a point. Beyond that point, it ceases to be funny, and it is because of that point that I wrote it." (Jones)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Beyond the point" of the comedy (the "funny") lies the scary territory that threatens one's very existence (Billington 92), which Wardle and others commonly have "labeled" or "pigeonholed" (depending on one's perspective) as "menace" (Merritt 9–10).

;Pinter's later plays

Though "comedy of menace" is generally applied to Pinter's early work of the late 1950s through the middle of the 1960s, including ''[[The Collection (play)|The Collection]]'' (1961), ''[[The Lover (play)|The Lover]]'' (1963), ''[[Tea Party (play)|Tea Party]]'' (1965, 1968), and ''[[The Homecoming]]'' (1965), even Pinter's late plays, like ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' (1996) and ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' (2000), his last two full-length stage plays, exhibit his characteristic amalgam of the comic and the menacing, a sense of threat or impending doom; there is less comedy and more menace in ''Ashes to Ashes'', in which heavy echoes of the [[Holocaust]] predominate; a more comedy than menace in ''Celebration'', where heightened comic dialogue outweighs the frightening undercurrents of terror, the terrifying, or the terrible.

;''Celebration'' (2000)

While reviewers and other audience members describe ''[[Celebration (play)|Celebration]]'' as hilarious ("one of Pinter's funniest plays", according to Billington [404]), the nature of the relationships of two sets of diners (three couples) having dinner in an upscale restaurant (which some critics assume that Pinter modeled on [[The Ivy]], in London's [[West End (London)|West End]]) – "this is the best and most expensive restaurant in the whole of Europe" (Pinter, ''Celebration'' 364) – remains characteristically ambiguous; Billington describes one set of couples as "a strangely rootless bunch with a depleted sense of family" (405).

One set (the two couples seated at Table One) consists of brothers Lambert and Matt and their wives, Prue and Julie, who are sisters; the second set of diners (the couple seated at Table Two) consists of a banker and his young wife, Suki, who comically turns out to have had an affair with Lambert when she was 18 (Billington 104).

As the "''maître d'hôtel''" emits platitudes geared to elevate the nouveaux riches in their own imagined esteem ("I believe the concept of this restaurant rests in that [[public house]] of my childhood" [Pinter, ''Celebration'' 371]), the "''maîtress d'hôtel''" appears to dwell on a peculiar past family and sex life (373–74), while the Waiter engages in "interjections" spinning fantasied impossible memories of a grandfather who knew writers, other artists, and various other public figures of multiple decades and geographical locations too far apart to have been experienced personally in one man's lifetime (367, 375).

Lambert and Matt reveal themselves to be rather uncouth bullies ("[[Teddy boys]]", according to some London reviews)—
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Lambert's [[mobile phone]] rings''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT  Who the fuck's this?&lt;br&gt;
''He switches it on''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT (''cont''.)  Yes? What? (''He listens briefly''.)  I said no calls! It's my fucking wedding anniversary!&lt;br&gt;
''He switches it off''.&lt;br&gt;
LAMBERT (''cont''.) Cunt.&lt;br&gt;  (Pinter, ''Celebration'' 364)—&lt;/blockquote&gt;
who describe themselves as "consultants … Strategy consultants. … It means we don't carry guns.  … We don't have to! … We're peaceful strategy consultants. … Worldwide.  Keeping the peace (379). ''Strategy consultant'' could be a [[euphemism|euphemistic]] catchall for  warmonger, manager of [[terrorism]], purveyor of [[counter-terrorism]], or orderer of [[covert operations]].

As the banker Russell interprets their explanation, ''peaceful strategy consultants'' seems vaguely menacing: "We need more people like you.  Taking responsibility.  Taking charge.  Keeping the peace.  Enforcing the peace.  Enforcing peace.  We need more like you" (379).  This speech stressing "force" (in the repetitions of ''Enforcing'') occurs after Russell has already revealed his own ilk:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Look at me.  I'm basically a totally disordered personality; some people would describe me as a [[Psychopathy|psychopath]].  (''to Suki'') Am I right?&lt;br&gt;
SUKI  Yes.&lt;br&gt;
RUSSELL  But when I'm sitting in this restaurant I suddenly find I have no psychopathic tendencies at all.  I don't feel like killing everyone in sight, I don't feel like putting a bomb under everyone's arse.  I feel something quite different, I have a sense of equilibrium, of harmony, I love my fellow diners.  Now this is very unusual for me.  Normally I feel—as I've just said—absoute malice and hatred towards everyone within spitting distance—but here I feel love. How do you explain it?&lt;br&gt;
SUKI  It's the ambience. (370–71)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Lambert and Matt are distantly reminiscent of Gus and Ben from ''The Dumb Waiter''; but distinctly less polite while living much higher on the hog.  One imagines such characters 
"strategically" plotting the "peaceful" rendition of others without any qualms while sipping [[Perrier]] and simultaneously planning their next wedding-anniversary dinner celebration (perhaps with a different set of wives) on their [[Mobile phone|mobiles]].

As the Waiter says in his apparently penultimate "interjection", in which one might detect intimations of mortality:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My grandfather introduced me to the mystery of life and I'm still in the middle of it.  I can't find the door to get out.  My grandfather got out of it.  He left it behind him and he didn't look back.&lt;br&gt;
He got that absolutely right.&lt;br&gt;
And I'd like to make one further interjection.&lt;br&gt;
''He stands still''.&lt;br /&gt;
''Slow fade''.&lt;br&gt;
(385)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

;"Apart From That" (Sketch) (2006)

Pinter mocks [[mobile phone]]s comically in an ostensibly-trivial wireless conversation, while still suggesting a residual bit of menace in the unsaid, developed as his last revue sketch ''[[Apart From That (sketch)|Apart From That]]'' (2006).  As Billington observes, this dramatic sketch inspired by Pinter's strong aversion to mobile phones is "very funny", but "as two people trade banalities over their mobile phones[,] there is a hint of something ominous and unspoken behind the clichéd chat" (429), as illustrated in the following excerpt:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Two people on mobile phones''.&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
How are you?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Very well.  And you? Are you well?&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I'm terribly well.  How about you?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Really well.  I'm really well.&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I'm so glad.&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Apart from ... oh you know ...&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I know.&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
Apart from ... oh you know ...&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
I do know. But apart from that ...?&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
How about you?&lt;br&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
Oh you know ... all things considered ...&lt;br&gt;
LAKE.&lt;br&gt;
I know.  But apart from that ...?&lt;br /&gt;
''Silence''.&lt;br /&gt;
GENE.&lt;br&gt;
Sorry. I've lost you.&lt;br&gt;
[....]
("Apart From That" 5–6)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Community informatics''' (CI) is an interdisciplinary field that is concerned with using [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technology (ICT)]] to empower members of communities and support their social, cultural, and economic development.&lt;ref name="source2"&gt;Gurstein, M. (2007). [http://eprints.rclis.org/10919/1/WHAT_IS_COMMUNITY_INFORMATICS_reading.pdf What is Community informatics? (And Why Does It Matter)], Polimetrica, Milan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;
Community informatics may contribute to enhancing democracy, supporting the development of social capital, and building well connected communities; moreover, it is probable that such similar actions may let people experience new positive [[social change]].&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; In community informatics, there are several considerations which are the social context, shared values, distinct processes that are taken by members in a community, and [[Social system|social]] and technical systems.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; It is formally located as an academic discipline within a variety of academic faculties including [[information science]], [[information systems]], [[computer science]], [[planning]], [[development studies]], and [[library science]] among others and draws on insights on community development from a range of backgrounds and disciplines. It is an interdisciplinary approach interested in using ICTs for different forms of community action, as distinct from pure academic study about ICT effects.&lt;ref name="source2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, L. and H. Linger (2009). "Community Informatics and Information Systems: how can they be better connected?" The Information Society 25(4): 1-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Most humans live in communities. In some urban areas, community and neighborhood are conflated but this may be a limited definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wellman|first1=Barry|last2=Leighton|first2=Barry|title=Networks, neighborhoods, and communities: Approaches to the study of the community question|journal=Urban Affairs Quarterly|date=March 1979|volume=14|issue=3|pages=363–390|doi=10.1177/107808747901400305}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Communities are defined as people coming together in pursuit of common aims or shared practices through any means, including physical, electronic, and  [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strath|first=B.|year=2001|title=Community/society: History of the concept =International Encyclopaedia of the Social &amp; Behavioural Sciences|publisher=Elsevier Science Ltd|pages=2378–2383|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;   They proliferate even while the ability to define them is amorphous.

Cultures ensure their growth and survival by continuing the norms and mores that are the bases of their way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What keeps societies together – Richard Sennett and Richard David Precht discuss in Berlin|url = http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/berlin/article/what-keeps-societies-together-richard-sennett-and-richard-david-precht-discuss-in-berlin.html|website = Cafebabel|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities can use the infrastructure of ICTs as a method of continuing cultures within the context of the Internet and the World Wide Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cyberpower {{!}} Public Sphere Project|url = http://www.publicsphereproject.org/patterns/print-pattern.php?begin=25|website = www.publicsphereproject.org|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once a cultural identity is defined within the context of these technologies, it can be replicated and disseminated through various means, including the sharing of information through websites, applications, databases, and file sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Common Ground: Holding Community Together {{!}} Holly Lisle: Official Author Homepage|url = http://hollylisle.com/common-ground-holding-community-together/|website = hollylisle.com|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this manner, a group that defines its cultural identity within the construct of technology infrastructure is empowered to hold valuable exchanges within the spheres of economics, political power, high and popular culture, education, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2427.00242/pdf|title = Constructing Premium Network Spaces:Reflections on Infrastructure Networks andContemporary Urban Development|last = Graham|first = Stephen|date = 2000|journal = International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|doi = 10.1111/1468-2427.00242|pmid = |access-date =|volume=24|pages=183–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the inception of the Internet and the World Wide Web, we have seen the exponential growth of enterprises&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HOW THE INTERNET CHANGED THE WORLD - Business Growth Fund|url = http://www.businessgrowthfund.co.uk/how-the-internet-changed-the-world/|website = Business Growth Fund|accessdate = 2015-11-12|language = en-US|first = Jon|last = Rhodes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from electronic commerce, social networking, entertainment and education, as well as a myriad of other contrivances and file exchanges that allow for an ongoing cultural enrichment through technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.arifyildirim.com/ilt508/sinikka.sassi.pdf|title = Cultural differentiation or social segregation?

To date there has been very considerable investment in supporting the electronic development of business communities, one-to-many  social tools (for example, corporate intranets, or purpose-built exchange  and [[social networking service]]s such as eBay, or Myspace),  or in developing applications for individual use. There is far less understanding, or investment in human-technical networks and processes  that are intended to deliberately result in social change or community change, particularly in communities for whom electronic communication is secondary to having an adequate income or social survival.

The communal dimension (and focus of Community Informatics) results in a strong interest in studying and developing strategies for how ICTs can enable and empower those living in physical communities. This is particularly the case in those communities where ICT access is done communally, through [[Telecentres]], information kiosks, community multimedia centres, and other technologies. This latter set of approaches has become of very considerable interest as Information and Communications Technology for Development ([[ICT4D]]) has emerged as significant element in strategic (and funding) approaches to social and economic development in [[Less developed country|Less Developed Countries]]. ICT4D initiatives have been undertaken by public, NGO and private sector agencies concerned with development such as the [[United Nations Development Program]], the [[World Bank]], the [[Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation]] (SDC), the [[MS Swaminathan Research Foundation]]; have emerged as a key element in the poverty alleviation component of the UN's [[Millennium Development Goals]]; and as important directions for private sector investment both from a market perspective (cf. the "[[Bottom of the Pyramid]]") and from companies concerned with finding a delivery channel for goods and services into rural and low income communities.

There is thus growing interest in Community Informatics as an approach to understanding of how different ICTs can enable and empower marginalized communities to achieve their collective goals.

==Understanding communities==
It is crucial to know how communities are formed and evolved and how the participation to a community occurs and differs while formation process.&lt;ref name="source1" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Azzopardi|first1=Andrew|last2=Grech|first2=Shaun|title=Inclusive communities a critical reader|date=2012|publisher=SensePublishers|location=Rotterdam|isbn=978-94-6091-849-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the nature of communities and the participation process will surely ensure designing and implemenameting a successful ICT solution that benefits members of community while communicating with each other or performing certain tasks.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt; The following points include a brief description of the nature of each potential community formation.

===Community as a place===
A group of people may form a community according to the place in which they live, enjoy staying, and work.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; They usually participate in communities within these three places since they gather together on consistent basis so that it is highly expected that such community is formed.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Beside the home and the work gathering, people usually like to spend their time at informal places called third places in where they meet their new or old friends or have a chance to meet new people.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;

===Community as a socio-spatial entity===
A group of people may form a community as they have frequent direct interactions or live in close proximity to each other.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; The members of such community may have strong bond and focused common goals which give them a higher status over other communities.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Moreover, as the number of the members increases, the community may become reputable and has a higher status over other communities.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;

===Community as links between people===
A group of people may form a community as they have common shared identity.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; People may form such community to support and advocate common shared values, morals or norms in which they believe.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; Such a community may have a set of symbols and be associated with a status over other communities.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; The inclusion and the exclusion to such community depend on whether or not a member share the same identity with others in the community.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt; For instance, people who descend from one origin may form a community in which only people from that origin can join the community even though they do not know each other in advance.&lt;ref name="source1" /&gt;

===Community of interests===
A group of people may form a community as they have similar affinity for a particular activity, experience, or subject.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; The geographical location is not necessary while forming such community, and the inclusion and the exclusion to such community depends on whether a new member has that affinity or not.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt;

===Communities linked to life stage===
A group of people may form a community if they share a similar experience in a distinct life stage.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; The experience could be related to the members themselves or to their relatives, such as their children.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; For instance, parents of elementary school children may form a community in which they care about their children while in school.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; As it is mentioned in the previous type of community formation, the members of such community have a common interest which is caring about their children while in school.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; This type of community may persist over time, but the inclusion and the exclusion to it may happen consistently as people are no longer in that distinct life stage.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt;

===Communities of practice===
A group of people who share a similar profession may form a community in which they work to attain their goals and advance in their profession.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; Three important concepts are considered while forming community of practice which are mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; In a community of practice, the members have to be mutually engaged with each other by establishing collaborative relationships that will allow them to willingly work on certain joint activities.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; In the second concept which is joint enterprise, the members of a community of practice are supposed to discuss and agree upon the work responsibilities so that they can work in harmony, and each member knows his responsibility and his expected contributions to the community.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; In addition to these two concepts, the members of the community of practice have a shared repertoire of procedures or ways to perform certain tasks.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt; They usually agree upon these procedures and practices that they establish and develop over time.&lt;ref name="source1"/&gt;

== Conceptual approaches ==
As an academic discipline, CI can be seen as a field of practice in applied information and communications technology. Community informatics is a technique for looking at economic and social development within the construct of technology&amp;mdash;online health communities, social networking websites, cultural awareness and enhancement through online connections and networks, electronic commerce, information exchanges, as well as a myriad of other aspects that contributes to creating a personal and group identity.  The term was brought to prominence by [[Michael Gurstein]].  Michael Gurstein says that community informatics is a technology strategy or discipline that connects at the community level economic and social development with the emergence of community and civic networks, electronic commerce, online participation, self-help, virtual health communities, "Tele-centres", as well as other types of online institutions and corporations.  He brought out the first representative collection of academic papers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurstein|first=Michael|year=2000|title=Community informatics: enabling communities with information and communications technologies|publisher=Hershey, PA, Idea Group Pub}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others, such as Brian Loader and his colleagues at the University of Teesside used the term in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Loader, B. and L. Keeble (2002). Community informatics : shaping computer-mediated social relations. New York, Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt;

CI brings together the practices of community development and organization, and insights from fields such as sociology, planning, computer science, [[critical theory]],  women's studies, library and information sciences, management information systems, and management studies. Its outcomes&amp;mdash;[[community network]]s and community-based ICT-enabled service applications&amp;mdash;are of increasing interest to grassroots organizations, NGOs and civil society, governments, the private sector, and multilateral agencies among others. Self-organized community initiatives of all varieties, from different countries, are concerned with ways to harness ICT for [[social capital]], poverty alleviation and for the empowerment of the "local" in relation to its larger economic, political and social environments. Some claim it is potentially a form of 'radical practice'.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Garth, Community Networking as Radical Practice The Journal of Community Informatics, Vol 1, No 3 (2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Community informatics may in fact, not gel as a single field within the academy, but remain a convenient locale for interdisciplinary activity, drawing upon many fields of social practice and endeavour, as well as knowledge of community applications of technology. However, one can begin to see the emergence of a postmodern "trans-discipline" presenting a challenge to existing disciplinary "stove-pipes" from the perspectives of the rapidly evolving fields of technology practice, technology change, public policy and commercial interest. Whether or not such a "trans-discipline" can maintain its momentum remains to be seen given the incertitude about the boundaries of such disciplines as community development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hustedde | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Ganowicz | first2 = J. | year = 2002 | title = The basics: What's essential about theory for community development practice? | url = | journal = Journal of the Community Development Society | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1080/15575330209490139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, there is a continuing disconnect between those coming from an Information Science perspective for whom social theories, including general theories of organisation are unfamiliar or seemingly irrelevant to solving complex 'technical' problems,&lt;ref name="Orlikowski"&gt;Orlikowski, W. J. and S. R. Barley (2001). "Technology and institutions: What can research on information technology and research on organizations learn from each other?" MIS Quarterly; management information systems 25(Jun): 145-165.&lt;/ref&gt; and those whose focus is upon the theoretical and practical issues around working with communities for democratic and social change&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stoecker | first1 = R | year = 2005 | title = Is Community Informatics good for communities? Questions confronting an emerging field | url = | journal = The Journal of Community Informatics | volume = 1 | issue = 3| pages = 13–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Neil | first1 = D | year = 2002 | title = Assessing community informatics: A review of methodological approaches for evaluating community networks and community technology centers | url = | journal = Internet Research | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 76–103 | doi=10.1108/10662240210415844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that many of those most actively involved in early efforts were academics, it is only inevitable that a process of "sense-making" with respect to these efforts would follow from "tool-making" efforts. These academics, and some community activists connected globally through the medium.{{Clarify|date=June 2014|reason=Through which medium?}}

A first formal meeting of researchers with an academic interest in these initiatives was held in conjunction with the 1999 Global Community Networking Conference in Buenos Aires, Argentina. This meeting began the process of linking community-based ICT initiatives in [[Developed country|developed countries]] with initiatives undertaken in [[Developing country|developing countries]], which were often part of larger economic and social development programmes funded by agencies such as the [[UN Development Programme]], [[World Bank]], or the [[International Development Research Centre]]. Academics and researchers interested in ICT efforts in developed countries began to see common and overlapping interests with those interested in similar work in less developed countries.  For example, the issue of sustainability as a technical, cultural, and economic problem for community informatics has resulted in a special issue of the Journal of Community Informatics &lt;ref&gt;Journal of Community Informatics Vol 1, No 2 (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the subject of ongoing conferences in Prato, Italy and other conferences in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciresearch.net|accessdate=2006-11-23|title=Community Informatics Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the beginnings of CI can be recognized from various trials in community networking in the 1970s (Clement 1981). An essential development occurred in the 1990s, due to the change of cost of computers and modems. Moreover, examples of using computer networking to initiate and enhance social activities was acknowledged by women's groups (Balka 1992) and by the labor movement (Mazepa 1997).&lt;ref name="source35" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Clement|first1=Andrew|last2=Gurstein|first2=Michael|last3=Longford|first3=Graham|last4=Moll|first4=Marita|last5=Shade|first5=Leslie Regan|title=Connecting Canadians investigations in community informatics|date=2012|publisher=AU Press|location=Edmonton|isbn=978-1-926836-42-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social informatics beyond an immediate concern for a community===
{{main|Social informatics}}

Social informatics refers to the body of research and study that examines social aspects of computerization&amp;mdash;including the roles of information technology in social and organizational change, the uses of information technologies in social contexts, and the ways that the social organization of information technologies is influenced by social forces and social practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rkcsi.indiana.edu/ |title=Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics |publisher=Rkcsi.indiana.edu |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, social informatics research has been strong in the Scandinavian countries, the UK and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sawyer|first1=Steve|last2=Rosenbaum|first2=Howard|title=Social Informatics in the Information Sciences: Current Activities and Emerging Directions|journal=Informing Science: The International Journal of an Emerging Transdiscipline|date=2000|volume=3|pages=89–96|url=http://www.inform.nu/Articles/Vol3/v3n2p89-96r.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2014|issn=1521-4672}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe some researchers have pointed out that in order to create awareness of the importance of social issues of computing, one has to focus on [[didactics]] of social informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Godejord|first1=Per A|title=Fighting child pornography: Exploring didactics and student engagement in social informatics|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|volume=58|issue=3|pages=446–451|doi=10.1002/asi.20522}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within North America, the field is represented largely through independent research efforts at a number of diverse institutions. Social informatics research diverges from earlier, deterministic (both social and technological) models for measuring the social impacts of technology. Such technological deterministic models characterized information technologies as tools to be installed and used with a pre-determined set of impacts on society dictated by the technology's stated capabilities.  Similarly, the socially deterministic theory represented by some proponents of the [[social construction of technology|social construction of technology (SCOT)]] or [[social shaping of technology]] theory see technology as the product of human social forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Williams|first1=Robin|last2=Edge|first2=David|title=The social shaping of technology|journal=Research Policy|volume=25|issue=6|pages=865–899|doi=10.1016/0048-7333(96)00885-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
There is a tension between the practice and research ends of the field. To some extent this reflects the gap, familiar from other disciplines such as [[community development]], [[community organizing]] and community based research.&lt;ref&gt;Stoecker, R. (2005). Research methods for community change : a project-based approach. Thousand Oaks, Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the difficulty that Information Systems has in recognising the qualitative dimension of technology research means that the kind of approach taken by supporters of community informatics is difficult to justify to a positive field oriented towards solutions of technical, rather than social problems. This is a difficulty also seen in the relationship between strict technology research and management research.&lt;ref name="Orlikowski"/&gt;  Problems in conceptualising and evaluating complex social interventions relying on a technical base are familiar from [[community health]] and [[community education]]. There are long-standing debates about the desire for accountable - especially ''quantifiable'' and outcome-focused social development, typically practised by government or supported by foundations, and the more participatory, qualitatively rich, process-driven priorities of grass-roots community activists, familiar from theorists such as [[Paulo Freire]], or [[John Dewey#Deweyan pragmatism|Deweyan pragmatism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Some of the theoretical and practical tensions are also familiar from such disciplines as [[program evaluation]] and social policy, and perhaps paradoxically, Management Information Systems, where there is continual debate over the relative virtue and values of different forms of research and action, spread around different understandings of the virtues or otherwise of allegedly "scientific" or "value-free" activity (frequently associated with "responsible"  and deterministic public policy philosophies), and contrasted with more interpretive and process driven viewpoints in bottom-up or practice driven activity.  Community informatics would in fact probably benefit from closer knowledge of, and relationship to, theorists, practitioners, and evaluators of rigorous [[qualitative research]] and practice.

A further concern is the potential for practice to be "hijacked" by policy or academic agendas, rather than being driven by community goals, both in developed and developing countries. The ethics of technology intervention in indigenous or other communities has not been sufficiently explored, even though ICTs are increasingly looked upon as an important tool for social and economic development in such communities.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, L. and B. Craig (2006). Incorporating Indigenous World Views in Community Informatics. OTM Workshops 2006, LNCS 4277. Montpellier, France, Springer Berlin / Heidelberg: 237-246.
&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, neither explicit theoretical positions nor ideological positioning has yet emerged.  Many projects appear to have developed with no particular disciplinary affiliation, arising more directly from policy or practice imperatives to 'do something' with technology as funding opportunities arise or as those at the grassroots (or working with the grassroots) identify ICT as possible resources to respond to local issues, problems or opportunities. The papers and documented outcomes (as questions or issues for further research or elaboration) on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070105200350/http://ccnr.webstylus.net/wiki/ wiki of the October 2006 Prato conference] demonstrate that many of the social, rather than technical issues are key questions of concern to any practitioner in community settings: how to bring about change; the nature of authentic or manufactured community; ethical frameworks; or the politics of community research.

A different strain of critique has emerged from gender studies. Some theorists have argued that feminist contributions to the field have yet to be fully acknowledged and Community Informatics as a research area has yet to welcome feminist interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peddle|first=Katrina |author2=Powell, Alison |author3=Shade, Leslie Regan|title=Bringing feminist perspectives into community informatics|journal=Atlantis: A Women's Studies Journal|year=2008|volume=32|issue=2|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exists despite the presence of several gender-oriented studies and leadership roles played by women in community informatics initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peddle|first=Katrina |author2=Powell, Alison |author3=Shade, Leslie Regan|title=Bringing feminist perspectives into community informatics|journal=Atlantis: A Women's Studies Journal|year=2008|volume=32|issue=2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and practice interests ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2014}}

{{One source section|date=September 2017}}

Research and practice ranges from concerns with purely virtual communities; to situations in which virtual or online communication are used to enhance existing communities in urban, rural, or remote geographic locations in developed or developing countries; to applications of ICTs for the range of areas of interest for communities including social and economic development, environmental management, media and "content" production, public management and e-governance among others.  A central concern, although one not always realized in practice is with "enabling" or "empowering" communities with ICT that is, ensuring that the technology is available for the community.  This further implies an approach to development which is rather more "bottom up" than "top down".

Areas of concern range from small-scale projects in particular communities or organizations which might involve only a handful of people, such as [[telecentres]]; an on online community of disabled people;  civic networks and  to large national, government sponsored networking projects in countries such as Australia and Canada or local community projects such as working with Maori families in New Zealand.  The [[Gates Foundation]] has been active in supporting public libraries in countries such as Chile.  An area of rapidly developing interest is in the use of ICT as a means to enhance citizen engagement as an "e-Governance" counterpart (or counterweight) to transaction oriented initiatives.

A key conceptual element and framing concept for Community Informatics is that of "effective use" introduced initially by [[Michael Gurstein]] in a critique of a research pre-occupation with the Digital Divide as ICT "access".&lt;ref&gt;Gurstein, M. B. (2000). "Effective use: A community informatics strategy beyond the Digital Divide" First Monday, volume 8, number 12 (December 2003) URL: http://firstmonday.org/issues/issue8_12/gurstein/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  CI is concerned with how ICTs are used in practice and not simply facilitating "access" to them and the notion of "effective use" is a bridge between CI research (research and analysis of the constituent elements of effective use), CI policy (developing enabling structures and programmes supportive of "effective use") and practice (implementing applications and services in support of local communities).

Another way to understand CI is Clement and Shade's "access rainbow" (Clement and Shade 2000).&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt; Clement and Shade have contended that accomplishing insignificant specialized connectedness to the Internet is no assurance that an individual or group will prevail with regards to appropriating new ICTs in ways that advance their improvement, independence, or empowerment. It is an approach which has multi-layered socio-specialized model for universal access to ICTs. It is displayed as seven layers, starting with the fundamental technical components of connectedness and moving upward through layers that inexorably push the essential social framework of access. The seven layers are: 1. Carriage 2. Devices 3. Software tools Internet 4. Content/services 5. Service/access 6. Literacy / social facilitation 7. Governance.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt; Even though that all elements are important, the most important one is the content /service layer in the middle, since this is where the actual utility is most direct. The upper layers focus on social dimensions and the lower layers focus on technical aspects.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt;

Many practitioners would dispute any necessary connection to university research, regarding academic theorising and interventions as constraining or irrelevant to grassroots activity which should be beyond the control of traditional institutions, or simply irrelevant to practical local goals.

Some of the commonalities and differences may be in fact be due to national and cultural differences. For example, the capacity of many North American (and particularly US) universities to engage in [[service learning]] as part of progressive charters in communities large and small is part of a long-standing tradition absent elsewhere.  The tradition of service learning is almost entirely absent in the UK, Australia, or New Zealand, (and of limited significance in Canada) where the State has traditionally played a much stronger role in the delivery of community services and information.

In some countries such as the UK, there is a tradition of locally based grassroots community technology, for example in Manchester, or in [[Hebden Bridge]]. In Italy and the Netherlands, there also appears to have been a strong connection between the development of local civic networks based around a tradition of civic oppositionism, connected into the work of progressive academics.

In Latin America, Africa and many parts of Asia these efforts have been driven by external funding agencies as part of larger programs and initiatives in support of broader economic and social development goals. However, these efforts have now become significantly "indigenized" (and particularly in Latin America) and "bottom-up" ICT efforts are increasingly playing a leading role in defining the future use of ICT within local communities.

In Canada, The Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking (CRACIN) was established in 2003. Their goal is to explore and archive the status and achievements of CI activities in Canada. It is a research partnership between scholastics, specialists, and public sector delegates.&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt;

== Networks ==
There are emerging online and personal networks of researchers and practitioners in community informatics and community networking in many countries as well as international groupings.  The past decade has also seen conferences in many countries, and there is an emerging literature for theoreticians and practitioners including the on-line Journal of Community Informatics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci-journal.net |title=Journal of Community Informatics |accessdate=30 August 2010 |publisher=Centre for Community Informatics, Research, Development and Training (CCIRDT) &amp; Faculty of Informatics and Design, Cape Peninsula University of Technology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is surprising in fact, how much in common is found when people from developed and non-developed countries meet. A common theme is the struggle to convince policy makers of the legitimacy of this approach to developing electronically literate societies, instead of a top-down or trickle-down approach, or an approach dominated by technical, rather than social solutions which in the end, tend to help vendors rather than communities. A common criticism that is frequently raised amongst participants at events such as the Prato conferences is that a focus on technical solutions evades the social changes that communities need to achieve in their values, activities and other people-oriented outcomes in order to make better use of technology.

The field tends to have a progressive bent, being concerned about the use of technology for social and cultural development connected to a desire for [[capacity building]] or expanding [[social capital]], and in a number of countries, governments and foundations have funded a variety of community informatics projects and initiatives, particularly from a more tightly controlled, though not well-articulated social planning perspective, though knowledge about long-term effects of such forms of social intervention on use of technology is still in its early stages.

=== Public libraries and community networks===
Even though that community networks and public libraries have similitudes in various ways, there are some obstacles that upset the probability of cooperation in the future between them. Albeit both CNs and libraries are concerned with giving information services to the society, an exchange is by all accounts lacking between the two communities. The mission of libraries is frequently rather barely engaged and, with regards to managing people and different institutes, their methodology can be to some degree unbending. Thusly, CN specialists, while institutionally more adaptable, rush to expel the part of public libraries in the community, tending to see the library essentially as a store of books upheld by public subsidizing. Public libraries have a long-standing custom of association with their communities, yet their conditions and concerns contrast from those of community networks (CNs).&lt;ref name="source35" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6722">A '''coordinative definition''' is a postulate which assigns a partial meaning to the theoretical terms of a  scientific theory by correlating the mathematical objects of the ''pure'' or formal/syntactical aspects of a theory with physical objects in the world. The idea was formulated by the [[logical positivists]] and arises out of a [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] vision of mathematics as pure symbol manipulation. 

==Formalism==
In order to get a grasp on the motivations which inspired the development of the idea of coordinative definitions, it is important to understand the doctrine of formalism as it is conceived in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. For the formalists, mathematics, and particularly geometry, is divided into two parts: the ''pure'' and the ''applied''. The first part consists in an uninterpreted axiomatic system, or syntactic calculus, in which terms such as ''point'', ''straight line'' and ''between'' (the so-called primitive terms) have their meanings assigned to them implicitly by the axioms in which they appear. On the basis of deductive rules eternally specified in advance, pure geometry provides a set of theorems derived in a purely logical manner from the axioms.  This part of mathematics is therefore ''a priori'' but devoid of any empirical meaning, not synthetic in the sense of Kant.

It is only by connecting these primitive terms and theorems with physical objects such as rulers or rays of light that, according to the formalist, pure mathematics becomes applied mathematics and assumes an empirical meaning. The method of correlating the abstract mathematical objects of the pure part of theories with physical objects consists in coordinative definitions. 

It was characteristic of logical positivism to consider a scientific theory to be nothing more than a set of sentences, subdivided into the class of theoretical sentences, the class of observational sentences, and the class of mixed sentences. The first class contains terms which refer to theoretical entities, that is to entities not directly observable such as electrons, atoms and molecules; the second class contains terms which denote quantities or observable entities, and the third class consists of precisely the coordinative definitions which contain both types of terms because they connect the theoretical terms with empirical procedures of measurement or with observable entities. For example, the [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of "the [[geodesic]] between two points" as correspondent to "the path of a light ray in a vacuum" provides a coordinative definition. This is very similar to, but distinct from an [[operational definition]]. The difference is that coordinative definitions do not ''necessarily'' define theoretical terms in terms of laboratory procedures or experimentation, as operationalism does, but may also define them in terms of  observable or empirical ''entities''.

In any case, such definitions (also called ''bridge laws'' or ''correspondence rules'') were held to serve three important purposes. In the first place, by connecting the uninterpreted formalism with the observation language, they permit the assignment of  synthetic content to theories. In the second, according to whether they express a factual or a purely conventional content, they allow for the subdivision of science into two parts: one factual and independent of human conventions, the other non-empirical and conventional. This distinction is reminiscent of Kant's division of knowledge into content and form. Lastly, they allow for the possibility to avoid certain vicious circles that arise with regard to such matters as the measurement of the speed of light in one direction. As has been pointed out by John Norton with regard to  [[Hans Reichenbach]]'s arguments about the nature of geometry: on the one hand, we cannot know if there are universal forces until we know the true geometry of spacetime, but on the other, we cannot know the true geometry of spacetime until we know whether there are universal forces. Such a circle can be broken by way of coordinative definition.(Norton 1992).

From the point of view of the logical empiricist, in fact, the question of the "true geometry" of spacetime does not arise, given that saving, e.g., [[Euclidean geometry]] by introducing universal forces which cause rulers to contract in certain directions, or postulating that such forces are equal to zero, does not mean saving the Euclidean geometry of ''actual'' space, but only changing the definitions of the corresponding terms. There are not really two incompatible theories to choose between, in the case of the true geometry of spacetime, for the empiricist (Euclidean geometry with universal forces not equal to zero, or non-Euclidean geometry with universal forces equal to zero), but only one theory formulated in two different ways, with different meanings to attribute to the fundamental terms on the basis of coordinative definitions. However, given that, according to formalism, interpreted or applied geometry ''does'' have empirical content, the problem is not resolved on the basis of purely conventionalist considerations and it is precisely the coordinative definitions, which bear the burden of finding the correspondences between mathematical and physical objects, which provide the basis for an empirical choice.

==Objection==
The problem is that coordinative definitions seem to  beg the question. Since they are defined in conventional, non-empirical terms, it is difficult to see how they can resolve empirical questions.  It would seem that the result of using coordinative definitions is simply to shift the problem of the geometric description of the world, for example, into a need to explain the mysterious "isomorphic coincidences" between the conventions given by the definitions and the structure of the physical world.
Even in the simple case of defining "the geodesic between two points" as the empirical phrase "a ray of light in a vacuum", the correspondence between mathematical and empirical is left unexplained.

==Early life==
Epstein was born in [[Milwaukee]] to William Polacheck &lt;ref&gt;I came a Stranger, by Hilda Polacheck&lt;/ref&gt; and Hilda Satt. She studied music at the [[University of Chicago]] and library science at the [[University of Illinois]], graduating in 1943. She worked as a cataloguer at the latter institution while completing her degree, and upon graduation was appointed the Senior Music Librarian at [[Newark Public Library]]. In 1946 she began working as a cataloguer and reviser for the [[Library of Congress]] music section.&lt;ref name=uc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bmrcsurvey.uchicago.edu/collections/2549|accessdate=15 November 2013|publisher=University of Chicago|title=Dena J. Epstein Papers}}&lt;/ref&gt; After spending a period as a homemaker, she returned to the University of Chicago in 1964 as the Assistant Music Librarian, in which position she served for 22 years.&lt;ref name=mla/&gt;&lt;ref name=ban/&gt;

==Scholarship==
Beginning in 1955, Epstein began researching the historical origins of [[Slavery in the United States|American slave]] music.&lt;ref name=uc/&gt; Her 1977 book on the topic, ''Sinful Tunes and Spirituals: black folk music to the Civil War'', was awarded the Chicago Folklore Prize and the Simkins Prize of the Southern Historical Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sinful-Tunes-Spirituals-BLACK-American/dp/0252071506|accessdate=15 November 2013|publisher=Amazon|title=''Sinful Tunes and Spirituals''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other findings, Epstein demonstrated that the [[banjo]] emerged from the African slave tradition rather than rural white culture, a revelation that "shattered myths and sparked a remarkable revival of black string band music".&lt;ref name=ban&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.utk.edu/news/2013/11/the-librarian-and-the-banjo/|accessdate=15 November 2013|publisher=University of Tennessee Knoxville|title=''The Librarian and the Banjo''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein received two [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] grants for her research, which was included in several musicology journals. She also published ''Music Publishing in Chicago Before 1871'' (1969) and ''I Came a Stranger: The Story of a Hull-House Girl'' (1989), an edited autobiography of her mother.&lt;ref name=mla&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiclibraryassoc.org/?EpsteinAward|accessdate=15 November 2013|publisher=Music Library Association|title=Dena Epstein Award for Archival and Library Research in American Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Epstein served as president of the [[Music Library Association]] (MLA) from 1977 to 1979, and was awarded the association's highest citation in 1986. MLA adjudicates a research award named after Epstein.&lt;ref name=mla/&gt;

Filmmaker Jim Carrier created ''The Librarian and the Banjo'' to document Epstein's contribution to American ethnomusicology. He noted that she "revolutionized our understanding of American music... we take for granted that African-American music is the tap root of popular American music. We owe much of that knowledge to this music librarian who set out to correct history".&lt;ref name=ban/&gt;

Epstein's papers and correspondence are held by [[Columbia College Chicago]]'s Center for Black Music Research.&lt;ref name=uc/&gt;

Epstein also appeared in the PBS documentary program American Experience "[http://www.shoppbs.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/chicago/filmmore/index.html Chicago, City of the Century]".  Her interview regarding her mother and conditions in the Near West Side Neighborhood at the turn of the 19th century appears on Disc 3: Battle for Chicago.

'''Embodied cognitive science''' is an interdisciplinary field of research, the aim of which is to explain the mechanisms underlying intelligent behavior.   It comprises three main methodologies: 1) the modeling of psychological and biological systems in a holistic manner that considers the mind and body as a single entity, 2) the formation of a common set of general principles of intelligent behavior, and 3) the experimental use of robotic agents in controlled environments.

Embodied cognitive science borrows heavily from [[embodied philosophy]] and the related research fields of [[cognitive science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[artificial intelligence]]. From the perspective of neuroscience, research in this field was led by [[Gerald Edelman]] of the [[Neurosciences Institute]] at La Jolla, the late [[Francisco Varela]] of [[CNRS]] in France, and [[J. A. Scott Kelso]] of [[Florida Atlantic University]].  From the perspective of psychology, research by [[Michael Turvey]], [[Lawrence Barsalou]] and [[Eleanor Rosch]].  From the perspective of language acquisition, [[Eric Lenneberg]] and [[Philip Rubin]] at [[Haskins Laboratories]].  From the perspective of autonomous agent design, early work is sometimes attributed to [[Rodney Brooks]] or [[Valentino Braitenberg]].  From the perspective of artificial intelligence, see ''Understanding Intelligence'' by [[Rolf Pfeifer]] and Christian Scheier or ''How the body shapes the way we think'', also by Rolf Pfeifer and Josh C. Bongard. From the perspective of philosophy see [[Andy Clark]], [[Shaun Gallagher]], and [[Evan Thompson]].

[[Alan Turing|Turing]] proposed that a machine may need a human-like body to think and speak:

::''It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. That process could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc. Again, I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried'' (Turing, 1950).&lt;ref&gt;{{Turing 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional cognitive theory ==

Embodied cognitive science is an alternative theory to cognition in which it minimizes appeals to [[computational theory of mind]] in favor of greater emphasis on how an organism's body determines how and what it thinks. Traditional cognitive theory is based mainly around symbol manipulation, in which certain inputs are fed into a processing unit that produces an output. These inputs follow certain rules of syntax, from which the processing unit finds semantic meaning. Thus, an appropriate output is produced. For example, a human's sensory organs are its input devices, and the stimuli obtained from the external environment are fed into the nervous system which serves as the processing unit. From here, the nervous system is able to read the sensory information because it follows a syntactic structure, thus an output is created. This output then creates bodily motions and brings forth behavior and cognition. Of particular note is that cognition is sealed away in the brain, meaning that mental cognition is cut off from the external world and is only possible by the input of sensory information.

== The embodied cognitive approach ==

Embodied cognitive science differs from the traditionalist approach in that it denies the input-output system. This is chiefly due to the problems presented by the [[Homunculus argument]], which concluded that semantic meaning could not be derived from symbols without some kind of inner interpretation. If some little man in a person's head interpreted incoming symbols, then who would interpret the little man's inputs? Because of the specter of an infinite regress, the traditionalist model began to seem less plausible. Thus, embodied cognitive science aims to avoid this problem by defining cognition in three ways.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Larry|title=The Embodied Cognition Programme|journal=Philosophy Compass|date=March 2007|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1747-9991.2007.00064.x|url=http://portal.uni-freiburg.de/cognition/lehre/archiv/ss13/mat-prosem/embodiedcognition/Shapiro_EmbodiedCognition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|340}}

=== Physical attributes of the body ===
The first aspect of embodied cognition examines the role of the physical body, particularly how its properties affect its ability to think. This part attempts to overcome the symbol manipulation component that is a feature of the traditionalist model. Depth perception for instance can be better explained under the embodied approach due to the sheer complexity of the action. Depth perception requires that the brain detect the disparate retinal images obtained by the distance of the two eyes. In addition, body and head cues complicate this further. When the head is turned in a given direction, objects in the foreground will appear to move against objects in the background. From this, it is said that some kind of visual processing is occurring without the need of any kind of symbol manipulation. This is because the objects appearing to move the foreground are simply appearing to move. This observation concludes then that depth can be perceived with no intermediate symbol manipulation necessary. 

A more poignant example exists through examining auditory perception. Generally speaking the greater the distance between the ears, the greater the possible auditory acuity. Also relevant is the amount of density in between the ears, for the strength of the frequency wave alters as it passes through a given medium. The brain's auditory system takes these factors into account as it process information, but again without any need for a symbolic manipulation system. This is because the distance between the ears for example does not need symbols to represent it. The distance itself creates the necessary opportunity for greater auditory acuity. The amount of density between the ears is similar, in that it is the actual amount itself that simply forms the opportunity for frequency alteration. Thus under consideration of the physical properties of the body, a symbolic system is unnecessary and an unhelpful metaphor.

=== The body's role in the cognitive process ===

The second aspect draws heavily from [[George Lakoff]]'s and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]]'s work on concepts. They argued that humans use metaphors whenever possible to better explain their external world. Humans also have a basic stock of concepts in which other concepts can be derived from. These basic concepts include spatial orientations such as up, down, front, and back. Humans can understand what these concepts mean because they can directly experience them from their own bodies. For example, because human movement revolves around standing erect and moving the body in an up-down motion, humans innately have these concepts of up and down. Lakoff and Johnson contend this is similar with other spatial orientations such as front and back too. As mentioned earlier, these basic stocks of spatial concepts are the basis in which other concepts are constructed. Happy and sad for instance are seen now as being up or down respectively. When someone says they are feeling down, what they are really saying is that they feel sad for example. Thus the point here is that true understanding of these concepts is contingent on whether one can have an understanding of the human body. So the argument goes that if one lacked a human body, they could not possibly know what up or down could mean, or how it could relate to emotional states.

&lt;blockquote&gt;

‘[I]magine a spherical being living outside of any gravitational field, with no
knowledge or imagination of any other kind of experience. What could UP
possibly mean to such a being?'&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"/&gt;{{rp|342}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

While this does not mean that such beings would be incapable of expressing emotions in other words, it does mean that they would express emotions differently from humans. Human concepts of happiness and sadness would be different because human would have different bodies. So then an organism's body directly affects how it can think, because it uses metaphors related to its body as the basis of concepts.

=== Interaction of local environment ===
A third component of the embodied approach looks at how agents use their immediate environment in cognitive processing. Meaning, the local environment is seen as an actual extension of the body's cognitive process. The example of a [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) is used to better imagine this. Echoing [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)]], this point claims that mental states are individuated by their role in a much larger system. So under this premise, the information on a PDA is similar to the information stored in the brain. So then if one thinks information in the brain constitutes mental states, then it must follow that information in the PDA is a cognitive state too. Consider also the role of pen and paper in a complex multiplication problem. The pen and paper are so involved in the cognitive process of solving the problem that it seems ridiculous to say they are somehow different from the process, in very much the same way the PDA is used for information like the brain. Another example examines how humans control and manipulate their environment so that cognitive tasks can be better performed. Leaving one's car keys in a familiar place so they aren't missed for instance, or using landmarks to navigate in an unfamiliar city. Thus, humans incorporate aspects of their environment to aid in their cognitive functioning.

== Examples of the value of embodied approach ==

The value of the embodiment approach in the context of cognitive science is perhaps best explained by [[Andy Clark]].&lt;ref name="Clark1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clark|first=Andy|title=An Embodied Cognitive Science?|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=September 1999|volume=3|issue=9|pages=345–351|url=http://psy.haifa.ac.il/~ep/Lecture%20Files/AI/Secure/Download/Clark%20Andy%20-%20Embodied%20Cog%20Science%20%281999%20Trends%29.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2011|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01361-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|345–351}} He makes the claim that the brain alone should not be the single focus for the scientific study of cognition

&lt;blockquote&gt;

It is increasingly clear that, in a wide variety of cases, the individual brain should not be the sole locus of cognitive scientific interest. Cognition is not a phenomenon that can be successfully studied while marginalizing the roles of body, world and action.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"/&gt;{{rp|350}}

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following examples used by Clark will better illustrate how embodied thinking is becoming apparent in scientific thinking.

=== Bluefin tuna ===

''[[Thunnus]]'', or tuna, long baffled conventional biologists with its incredible abilities to accelerate quickly and attain great speeds. A biological examination of the tuna shows it is simply not capable of such feats. However, an answer can be found when taking the tuna's embodied state into account. The [[bluefin tuna]] is able to take advantage of and exploit its local environment by finding naturally occurring currents to increase its speed. The tuna also uses its own physical body for this end as well, by utilizing its tailfin to create the necessary vortices and pressure so it can accelerate and maintain high speeds. Thus, the bluefin tuna is actively using its local environment for its own ends through the attributes of its physical body.

=== Robots ===

Clark uses the example of the hopping [[robot]] constructed by Raibert and Hodgins to demonstrate further the value of the embodiment paradigm. These robots were essentially vertical cylinders with a single hopping foot. The challenge of managing the robot's behavior can be daunting because in addition to the intricacies of the program itself, there were also the mechanical matters regarding how the foot ought to be constructed so that it could hop. An embodied approach makes it easier to see that in order for this robot to function, it must be able to exploit its system to the fullest. That is, the robot's systems should be seen as having dynamic characteristics as opposed to the traditional view that it is merely a command center that just executes actions.

=== Vision ===

Clark distinguishes between two kinds of [[Visual perception|vision]], animate and pure vision. Pure vision is an idea that is typically associated with classical [[artificial intelligence]], in which vision is used to create a rich world model so that thought and reason can be used to fully explore the inner model. In other words, pure vision passively creates the external perceivable world so that the faculties of reason can be better used introspectively. Animate vision, by contrast, sees vision as the means by which real-time action can commence. Animate vision is then more of a vehicle by which visual information is obtained so that actions can be undertaken. Clark points to animate vision as an example of embodiment, because it uses both biological and local environment cues to create an active intelligent process. Consider the Clark's example of going to the drugstore to buy some Kodak film. In one's mind, one is familiar with the Kodak logo and its trademark gold color. Thus, one uses incoming visual stimuli to navigate around the drugstore until one finds the film. Therefore, vision should not be seen as a passive system but rather an active retrieval device that intelligently uses sensory information and local environmental cues to perform specific real-world actions.

=== Affordance ===

Inspired by the work of the American psychologist [[James J. Gibson]], this next example emphasizes the importance of action-relevant sensory information, bodily movement, and local environment cues. These three concepts are unified by the concept of affordances, which are possibilities of action provided by the physical world to a given agent. These are in turn determined by the agent's physical body, capacities, and the overall action-related properties of the local environment as well. Clark uses the example of an outfielder in baseball to better illustrate the concept of affordance. Traditional computational models would claim that an outfielder attempting to catch a fly-ball can be calculated by variables such as the running speed of the outfielder and the arc of the baseball. However, Gibson's work shows that a simpler method is possible. The outfielder can catch the ball so long as they adjust their running speed so that the ball continually moves in a straight line in their field of vision. Note that this strategy uses various affordances that are contingent upon the success of the outfielder, including their physical body composition, the environment of the baseball field, and the sensory information obtained by the outfielder. 

Clark points out here that the latter strategy of catching the ball as opposed to the former has significant implications for perception. The affordance approach proves to be non-linear because it relies upon spontaneous real-time adjustments. On the contrary, the former method of computing the arc of the ball is linear as it follows a sequence of perception, calculation and performing action. Thus, the affordance approach challenges the traditional view of perception by arguing against the notion that computation and introspection are necessary. Instead, it ought to be replaced with the idea that perception constitutes a continuous equilibrium of action adjustment between the agent and the world. Ultimately Clark does not expressly claim this is certain but he does observe the affordance approach can explain adaptive response satisfactorily.&lt;ref name="Clark1999"/&gt;{{rp|346}} This is because they utilize environmental cues made possible by perceptual information that is actively used in the real-time by the agent.

== General principles of intelligent behavior ==
In the formation of general principles of intelligent behavior, Pfeifer intended to be contrary to older principles  given in traditional artificial intelligence.  The most dramatic difference is that the principles are applicable only to situated robotic agents in the real world, a domain where traditional artificial intelligence showed the least promise.

Principle of Cheap Design and Redundancy: Pfeifer realized that implicit assumptions made by engineers often substantially influence a control architecture's complexity.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer2001"&gt;Pfeifer, R., Scheier, C.,  ''Understanding Intelligence'' (MIT Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-262-66125-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|436}}  This insight is reflected in discussions of the scalability problem in robotics.  The internal processing needed for some bad architectures can grow out of proportion to new tasks needed of an agent.  

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One of the primary reasons for scalability problems is that the amount of programming and knowledge engineering that the robot designers have to perform grows very rapidly with the complexity of the robot's tasks. There is mounting evidence that pre-programming cannot be the solution to the scalability problem ... The problem is that programmers introduce too many hidden assumptions in the robot's code.&lt;ref&gt;Stoytchev, A. (2006). [http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~alex/papers/NIPS_Workshop_2006.pdf Five Basic Principles of Developmental Robotics] NIPS 2006 Workshop on Grounding Perception, Knowledge and Cognition in Sensori-Motor Experience.  Department of Computer Science, Iowa State U&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The proposed solutions are to have the agent exploit the inherent physics of its environment, to exploit the constraints of its niche, and to have agent morphology based on parsimony and the principle of Redundancy. Redundancy reflects the desire for the error-correction of signals afforded by duplicating like channels.  Additionally, it reflects the desire to exploit the associations between sensory modalities. (See [[modality (human-computer interaction)|redundant modalities]]).  In terms of design, this implies that redundancy should be introduced with respect not only to one sensory modality but to several.&lt;ref name="Pfeifer2001"/&gt;{{rp|448}}  It has been suggested that the fusion and transfer of knowledge between modalities can be the basis of reducing the size of the sense data taken from the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Konijn, Paul (2007). [http://www.diracproject.org/workshop-2007/pdf/DIRAC-Summer-Workshop.pdf Summer Workshop on Multi-Sensory Modalities in Cognitive Science] Detection and Identification of Rare Audiovisual Cues. DIRAC EU IP IST project, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;  This again addresses the scalability problem.

Principle of Parallel, Loosely-coupled Processes: An alternative to hierarchical methods of knowledge and [[action selection]]. This design principle differs most importantly from the Sense-Think-Act cycle of traditional AI. Since it does not involve this famous cycle, it is not affected by the [[frame problem]].

Principle of Sensory-Motor Coordination: Ideally, internal mechanisms in an agent should give rise to things like memory and choice-making in an emergent fashion, rather than being prescriptively programmed from the beginning.   These kinds of things are allowed to emerge as the agent interacts with the environment. The motto is, build fewer assumptions into the agent's controller now, so that learning can be more robust and idiosyncratic in the future. 

Principle of Ecological Balance: This is more a theory than a principle, but its implications are widespread.  Its claim is that the internal processing of an agent cannot be made more complex unless there is a corresponding increase in complexity of the motors, limbs, and sensors of the agent. In other words, the extra complexity added to the brain of a simple robot will not create any discernible change in its behavior. The robot's morphology must already contain the complexity in itself to allow enough "breathing room" for more internal processing to develop.

The Value Principle: This was the architecture developed in the Darwin III robot of [[Gerald Edelman]]. It relies heavily on [[connectionism]].

== Critical responses ==

=== Traditionalist response to local environment claim ===
A traditionalist may argue that objects may be used to aid in cognitive processes, but this does not mean they are part of a cognitive system.&lt;ref name="Shapiro2007"/&gt;{{rp|343}} Eyeglasses are used to aid in the visual process, but to say they are a part of a larger system would completely redefine what is meant by a visual system. However, supporters of the embodied approach could make the case that if objects in the environment play the functional role of mental states, then the items themselves should not be counted among the mental states.

==Resilience-Based Ecosystem Stewardship==
Resilience-Based Ecosystem Stewardship emphasizes [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] as a basic feature of the changing world as well as [[ecosystems]] that provide a suite of [[ecosystem services]] rather than a single [[resource]], and [[stewardship]] that recognizes [[Resource management|resource managers]] as an integral part of the systems they manage.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.

==Different types of environmental stewards==
{{tone|Section|date=January 2018}}
One author suggests that there are 3 types of environmental stewards: doers, donors, and practitioners. Doers go out and help the cause by taking action. For example, the doers in an oil spill would be the volunteers that go along the beach and help clean up the oil from the beaches. A donor is the person that financially helps the cause. They can do anything from donating their money, to hosting public events to raise funds. They are typically governmental agencies. Lastly there are practitioners. They work on a day-to-day basis to  steer governmental agencies, scientists, stakeholder groups, or any other group toward a stewardship outcome. Together these 3 groups make up environmental stewards and with the help keep the ecosystem running healthily.&lt;ref&gt;Increasing Capacity for Stewardship of Oceans and Coasts, P. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Anybody can be an environmental steward by being aware and knowledgeable of the world around them and making sure they do as little as possible to negatively impact our world. Without these groups it would be hard to get any sort of sustainability in our increasingly industrially based world. &lt;ref&gt;[[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]].

[[File:French Kiss.JPG|thumb|Two people French kissing]]

In English informal speech, a '''French kiss''', also known as a '''deep kiss''', is an amorous [[kiss]] in which the participants' [[tongue]]s extend to touch each other's lips or tongue. A "kiss with the tongue" stimulates the partner's lips, tongue and mouth, which are sensitive to the touch and induce physiological sexual arousal.  The oral zone is one of the principal [[erogenous zone]]s of the body. The implication is of a slow, passionate kiss which is considered intimate, [[Romance (love)|romantic]], [[erotic]] or [[Human sexuality|sexual]]. The sensation when two tongues touch, also known as "tongue touching", has been proven to stimulate endorphin release and reduce acute stress levels. French kissing is often described as ‘1st base’, and is used by many as an indicator of what stage a relationship has reached.

== Etymology ==
A French kiss is so called because at the beginning of the 20th century, in the English-speaking world, the [[French people|French]] had acquired a reputation for more adventurous and passionate sex practices. It originated in America and Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[France]], it is referred to as ''un baiser amoureux'' ("a lover's kiss") or ''un baiser avec la langue'' ("a kiss with the tongue"), even if in past times it was also known as ''baiser Florentin'' ("[[Florence|Florentine]] kiss"). The Petit Robert 2014 French dictionary, released on May 30, 2013, added the French verb "se galocher" — slang for kissing with tongues — making it the first time a single word described the practice (except in Quebec, where the verb "frencher" means French kissing; Australia, where the term "pash" is used; the English verb ”shift” is used in casual conversation in [[Ireland]]; the German verb ''knutschen''; the Italian verbs ''limonare'' and ''pomiciare''; and the Hungarian verb ''megcsókol/csókolózik'').

== Disease risks ==
French kissing carries moderate risk of [[HPV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=French kissing ups risk of oral HPV infection|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/05/12/-idUSTRE54B61920090512|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility of contracting [[HIV]] from French kissing is extremely low as transmission would require an open wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV/AIDS 101|url=https://www.cdc.gov/CDCTV/HivAids101/Transcripts/HivAids101.pdf|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man with HIV may have infected partner with a kiss|url=http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/9707/10/nfm.aids.kiss/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=12 May 2015|date=10 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] considers transmission of [[Hepatitis B]] via French kissing to be an unlikely mode of infection.&lt;ref name="cdc.gov"&gt;{{cite web

The '''Functional Element [[Single nucleotide polymorphisms|SNPs]] Database''' ('''FESD''') is a [[biological database]] of  [[single nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]] in [[Molecular biology]].&lt;ref name="pmid15608252"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/nar/gki082 |title=FESD: A Functional Element SNPs Database in human |year=2004 |last1=Kang |first1=H.

The database is a tool designed to organize functional elements into categories in human gene regions and to output their sequences needed for genotyping &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kadarmideen | first1 = Haja N. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010 | title = Functsnp: An R Package To Link Snps To Functionalknowledge And Dbautomaker: A Suite Of Perlscripts To Build SNP Databases | doi = 10.1186/1471-2105-11-311 | journal = BMC Bioinformatics | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 311–319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; experiments as well as provide a set of SNPs that lie within each region. The database defines functional elements into ten types: promoter regions, [[CpG islands]],[[5' untranslated regions]] (5'-UTRs), translation start sites, [[splice site]]s, coding exons, [[introns]], translation stop sites, polyadenylation signals, and 3' UTRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MAH | first1 = James T.

Researchers can manually choose a group of SNPs of special interest for certain functional elements along with their corresponding sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1607-551X(09)70057-9 |title=Dynamic Programming for Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ID Identification in Systematic Association Studies |year=2009 |last1=Yang |first1=Cheng-Hong |last2=Chuang |first2=Li-Yeh |last3=Cheng |first3=Yu-Huei |last4=Wen |first4=Cheng-Hao |last5=Chang |first5=Hsueh-Wei |journal=The Kaohsiung Journal of Medical Sciences |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=165–76 |pmid=19502133}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The database combines information from sources such as HapMap, UCSC GoldenPath, dbSNP, OMIM, and TRANSFAC. Users can obtain information about tagSNPs and simulate LD blocks for each gene. FESD is still a developing database and is not widely known so was unable to find projects that used the database so I found research using similar databases or databases that are combined in FESD’s information pool.&lt;ref&gt;Kang, H.J. ( 1,2,3 ), et al. "FESD: A Functional Element Snps Database In Human." Nucleic Acids Research 33.DATABASE ISS. (2005): D518-D522. Scopus®. Web. 4 Nov. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
The database is a reference of all known SNPs in functional units that may affect a given phenotype in which some cases may be a disease. You select SNps based on disease, gene, or factor. The database has a link on the HapMap Project website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khapmap.org&lt;/ref&gt; The database may very well have been used in one of the following research examples. The Korean HapMap Project website is quoted saying "We have developed a series of software programs for association studies as well as the comparison and analysis of Korean HapMap data with other populations, such as European, Chinese, Japanese, and African populations. The developed soft- ware includes HapMapSNPAnalyzer, SNPflank, HWE Test, FESD, D2GSNP, SNP@Domain, KMSD, KFOD, KFRG, and SNP@WEB."&lt;ref&gt;Journal Article.ID 5299735. Kim,Young,Uk. Kim,Seung-Ho. Jin,Hoon. Park,Young-Kyu. Ji,Mihyun. Joo,Young. 2008.The Korean HapMap Project Website&lt;/ref&gt; I am unaware how many species are included; however, there is an alphabetical list of all the genes included in case you know the gene name but not the disease it is associated with or factor it is located in.  Some of the genes were from Humans, mice, and some were from D. Melanogaster. Information cannot be submitted to the database publicly. The database is updated often and the information is pooled from the sites listed on the page. There is also a user guide tab that shows you what each process should look like.

==Research==
*&lt;big&gt;Susceptibility to Myocardial Infarction&lt;/big&gt;
The study involved the investigation of ITIH3 (inter alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 3). Researchers used Functional analysis, Linkage disequilibrium mapping,SNP markers, and the HapMap database. FESD Version II may have been used since it has the information from HapMap as well as other databases. The found that the gene was on chromosome 3. In vitro functional analyses showed that this SNP enhanced the transcriptional level of the ITIH3 gene. Furthermore, we found expression of the ITIH3 protein in the vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the human atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting ITIH3 SNP to be a novel genetic risk factor of MI. The gene has been shown to be related to the proinflammatory process of immune response. ITIH3 makes a complex with the locally synthesized hyaluronan (HA) and interacts with inflammatory cells. The ITIH3-HA complex has been reported to be involved in inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The most statistically-significant SNP did not substitute an amino acid of ITIH3 protein. The researchers hypothesized that this synonymous SNP affected the transcriptional regulation, because several papers reported that some transcriptional factors bound to the exonic coding sequences of some genes and regulated their transcriptional level. There was expression of ITIH3 protein in the atherosclerotic lesion. ITIH3 might play a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and subsequent myocardial infarction.&lt;ref&gt;Ebana, Yusuke, et al. "A Functional SNP In ITIH3 Is Associated With Susceptibility To Myocardial Infarction." Journal of Human Genetics 52.3 (2007): 220-229.&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;big&gt; Hepatocellular Carcinoma&lt;/big&gt;
These Researchers used snp selecting web tools and again could have used FESD Version II to select their SNPs. They hypothesized that the polymorphisms in circadian genes may be associated with prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The circadian negative feedback regulation genes- CRY1, CRY2, PER1, PER2 and PER3 were identified based on a comprehensive literature review and the potentially functional SNPs were selected through web tools. Finally, a total of twelve potentially functional SNPs in five genes were selected, including CRY1: rs1056560, rs3809236; CRY2:  rs6798, rs2292910; PER1: rs2585405, rs3027178; PER2: rs934945, rs2304669; PER3: rs2640908, rs172933, rs2859390, rs228669. When the dominant genetic model was tested, their data showed that only SNP rs2640908 in PER3 gene was significantly associated with overall survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Patients carrying at least one variant allele of rs2640908 had a significantly decreased risk of death when compared with those carrying homozygous wild-type alleles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhao | first1 = Binyu | display-authors = etal   | year = 2012 | title = A Functional Polymorphism In PER3 Gene Is Associated With Prognosis In Hepatocellular Carcinoma | url = | journal = Liver International | volume = 32 | issue = 9| pages = 1451–1459 | doi=10.1111/j.1478-3231.2012.02849.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*&lt;big&gt; Rheumatoid Arthritis&lt;/big&gt;
A polymorphism interaction analysis (PIA) algorithm was used to obtain cooperating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to RA disease. The acquired SNP pairs were used to construct a SNP-SNP network. Sub-networks defined by hub SNPs were then extracted and turned into gene modules by mapping SNPs to genes using dbSNP database. The FESD Version II would also be a good choice in database because it also covers the dbSNP database. They ran the Haseman Elston test, then a random forest algorithm. The shared SNPs detected were then ran through a polymorphism interaction analysis (PIA) algorithm. They performed Gene ontology analysis of the 5 modules that were created. They suggested that Ets-1 may be an important transcription factor in the cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathway and destructive cascade characteristic of RA. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCA1, was induced during differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages, and there was a dual regulatory function for ABCA1 in macrophage lipid metabolism and inflammation. Extracellular signals are transduced intracellularly via multiple pathways, resulting in alterations in the transcription and translation of specific proteins. Some of these signaling pathways result in the production of proteins, including cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. The zinc-finger protein 238 (ZNF238) is attached to zinc-finger proteins that can regulate the human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Hub gene CD160 is a potential RA association gene. The CD160 receptor represents a unique triggering surface molecule that is expressed by cytotoxic NK cells, it participates in the inflammatory response and determines the type of subsequent specific immunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lin | first1 = Hua | display-authors = etal   | year = | title = Mining Functional Gene Modules Linked With Rheumatoid Arthritis Using A SNP-SNP Network."

(15 May 1994) "Genetic ecology: a new interdisciplinary science, fundamental for evolution, biodiversity and biosafety evaluations" ''Experientia'' vol50:5 pp. 429–437&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, genetic data is not thought of outside of any organism save for criminal for criminal forensics. However, genetic material has the ability to be taken up by various organisms that exist within an abiotic medium through natural transformations that may occur.&lt;ref&gt;Lederberg, J. (1994) ''The Transformation of Genetics'' The Rockefeller University, New York, New York&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this field of study focuses on interaction, exchange, and expression of genetic material that may not be shared by species had they not been in the same environment.

==History==

E.B. Ford was the first geneticist to begin work in this field of study. E.B. Ford worked mostly during the 1950s and is most noted for his work with ''Maniola jurtina'' and published a book entitled ''Ecological Genetics'' in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Content_store/Sample_chapter/1405100338/Lowe_Ecological%20Genetics_sample%20chapter.pdf?q=ecological ''Ecological Genetics''] (n.d.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baxter S.W. ''et. al'' (2017) "EB Ford revisited: assessing the long-term stability of wing-spot patterns and population genetic structure of the meadow brown butterfly on the Isles of Scilly" ''Heredity''&lt;/ref&gt; This type of evolutionary biological study was only possible after gel electrophoresis had been designed in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Tiselius, A. (25 January 1937) "A New Apparatus for Electrophoretic Analysis of Colloidal Mixtures" ''Transactions of the Faraday Society''&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, a high throughput method for DNA analysis did not exist. This field of study began to become more popular following the 1980s with the development of polymerase chain reaction (PCR 1985) and poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis  (p. 1967).&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, A.L. ''et. al'' (7 September 1967) "Molecular weight estimation of polypeptide chains by electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gels" ''Biochem Biophys Res Commun''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/research/videohistory_catalog9577.html "The History of PCR"] (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; With this technology, segments of DNA could be sequenced, amplified, and proteins produced using bacterial transformations. The genetic material along with the proteins could be analyzed and more correct phylogenetic trees could be created. 

Since E.B. Ford's research, multiple other genetic ecologists have continued study within the field of genetic ecology such as PT Hanford&lt;ref&gt;Handford PT.

==Gene transfer==

Genetic information may transfer throughout an ecosystem in multiple ways. The first of which, on the smallest scale, being bacterial gene transfer (see [[bacterial transformations]]). Bacteria have the ability to exchange DNA. This DNA exchange, or [[horizontal gene transfer]], may provide various species of bacteria with the genetic information they need to survive in an environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amrls.cvm.msu.edu/microbiology/molecular-basis-for-antimicrobial-resistance/acquired-resistance/acquisition-of-antimicrobial-resistance-via-horizontal-gene-transfer "Horizontal Gene Transfer"]. (n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt; This can help many bacterial species survive within an environment.

A similar event has the ability to happen between plants and bacteria. For example, Agrobacterium tumefaciens has the ability to introduce genes into plants to cause the development of Gall disease. This occurs through genetic transfer between the ''A. tumefaciens'' and between the plant in question.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/biosecurity/education/dualuse-agriculture/2.-agricultural-biotechnology/methods-of-gene-transfer-in-plants.html "Methods of Gene Transfer in Plants"] (2011) ''Agricultural Biosecurity''&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, a similar event occurs each time viral infections occur within living organisms. The [[viruses]], whether positive or negative sense viruses, require a living organism to replicate their genes and produce more viruses. Once a virus is inside a living organism, it utilizes polymerases, ribosomes, and other biomolecules to replicate its own genetic material and to produce more virus genetic material similar to the original virus.&lt;ref&gt;7. Weaver, R. (2012). ''Molecular biology'' (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, gene transfer may occur through many varying means. Thus, the study of this gene transfer throughout each ecosystem, whether it be through a bacterial ecosystem or through the ecosystem of an organism, genetic ecology is the study of this gene transfer and its causes.

'''Letter frequency effect''' - the effect of [[letter frequency]] according to which the frequency with which the letter is encountered influences the recognition time of a letter. Letters of high frequency show a significant advantage over letters of low frequency in letter naming,&lt;ref&gt;Cosky, M. J. (1976). The role of letter recognition in word recognition. Memory &amp; Cognition, 4 , 207-214.&lt;/ref&gt; same-different matching,&lt;ref&gt;Egeth, H., &amp; Blecker, D.  (1971). Differential effects of familiarity on judgments of sameness and difference.  Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 9 (4), 321-326.&lt;/ref&gt; and visual search.&lt;ref&gt;Latimer, C. R. (1972). Search time as a function of context letter frequency. Perception, 1 , 57-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Letters of high frequency are recognized faster than letters of low frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Miozo, Michele &amp; Bastiani, Pierluigi de (2002). The Organization of Letter-Form Representations in Written Spelling: Evidence from Acquired Dysgraphia. Brain and Language 80, 366–392&lt;/ref&gt; Appelman and Mayzner (1981) in their re-analysis of the studies concerning letter frequency effect have found that in 3 out of 6 studies using [[mental chronometry|reaction times]] (RTs) as a [[dependent variable]] the letter frequency correlated significantly with RTs.&lt;ref&gt;Appelman, I. B., &amp; Mayzner , M. S. (1981). The letter-frequency effect and the generality of familiarity effects on perception.Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 30, 436 – 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discussion ==

Majority of studies on letter frequency effect failed to find a significant letter frequency effect.&lt;ref name="frequency"&gt;Boris, New &amp; Grainger, Johnatan (2011). On letter frequency effects. Acta Psychologica 138, 322 –328&lt;/ref&gt; These studies, however, used the [[same-different matching task]]&lt;ref name="frequency"/&gt; in which the participants see two letters and are to respond if these letters are same or different.&lt;ref name="frequency"/&gt; Therefore, the absence of letter frequency effect in these studies may be due to the participants using the visual form of a letter instead of a letter itself to match the letters.&lt;ref name="frequency"/&gt;

[[Computability theory]] is the part of the theory of [[computation]] that deals with what can be computed, in principle. [[Computational complexity theory]] deals with how hard computations are, in quantitative terms, both with upper bounds ([[algorithm]]s whose complexity in the worst cases, as use of computing resources, can be estimated), and from below (proofs that no procedure to carry out some task can be very fast).

'''''Microjazz''''' is a long-running series of [[sheet music]] publications by [[New Zealand]]-born [[United Kingdom|British]] pianist and composer [[Christopher Norton]]. The series is published by [[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]].
Based on classical technique yet using popular contemporary styles such as [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[rock 'n' roll]] and [[funk]], ''Microjazz'' aims to "develop musicianship and technique through the familiar sounds and styles of popular music". The series has established itself as a leading educational music series around the world, and has expanded over 20 years to include music for all of the major instruments with piano, ensemble books and midi file backings. It is now the biggest selling music series for Boosey &amp; Hawkes, with over a million sales to date.

== History ==
In 1948, J. R. Butler and Martin Miller formed an oil and gas consulting partnership known as J. R. Butler and Company.  Max Lents, who was not a partner at the beginning of J. R. Butler and Company, was considered as an original founding partner when he joined the firm a year later.  The company name then changed to Butler, Miller and Lents.

In 1970 its name was changed to Butler, Miller and Lents, Ltd., at which time it became a [[S corporation|Subchapter S Corporation]].

In 1976, the name of the firm was changed to its current name, Miller and Lents, Ltd. after J. R. Butler exchanged his interest in Butler, Miller and Lents, Ltd.

== Notable employees ==
=== M. Miller and M. Lents ===
In addition to founding Miller and Lents, Ltd., Max Lents and Martin Miller made significant contributions to the field of petroleum engineering.  They introduced the Miller-Lents [[Permeability (earth sciences)|Permeability]] Distribution which aids in describing the permeability of heterogeneous reservoirs and provides a “better match with actual field performance when applied to cycling operations in gas condensate reservoirs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=James T.|last2=Cobb|first2=William M.|title=Waterflooding|date=17 Dec 1997|publisher=Petroleum Recovery Research Center|pages=5–20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mood management theory''' posits that the consumption of messages, particularly entertaining messages, is capable of altering prevailing mood states, and that the selection of specific messages for consumption often serves the regulation of mood states (Zillmann, 1988a).

==History==
The idea of selecting media content in the interest of enhancing one's states has been proposed by Zillmann and Bryant (1985) and Zillmann (1988a). Initially, the assumptions were referred to as theory of affect-dependent stimulus arrangement, but subsequently gained more prominence under the label of mood management (Knobloch, 2006).

Mood management research can be traced back to [[Leon Festinger]]'s (1957) [[cognitive dissonance]] theory. Festinger notes that the human organism tries to establish internal congruity among cognitions such as attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge about oneself and the environment. When a person holds two cognitions that are incompatible, dissonance is produced. But such dissonance can be reduced through selective exposure, that is, individuals will seek out information that will reduce the dissonance and avoid information that will increase the already existing dissonance.

Festinger's theory was primarily laid out in cognitive terms, addressing exposure choices to persuasive messages.  Zillmann and his colleagues thus proposed the mood management theory that attempts to cope with the broadest possible range of message choices such as news, documents, comedies, dramas, tragedies, music performances, and sports. It deals with all conceivable moods rather than a single, specific affective state, such as dissonance (Zillman, 1988b).

==Fundamental assumptions==
Based on the hedonistic premise that individuals are motivated for pleasure and against pain, mood management theory states that, to the extent possible, individuals tend to arrange their environment so that good mood (commonly pleasure) is maximized or maintained, and bad mood (commonly pain) is diminished or alleviated. Environmental arrangement can take many forms, including psychically moving away from or avoiding situations that creates negative effect (such as avoiding a stressful traffic jam), or moving toward or selecting situations that result in gratification (such as strolling in a beautiful garden). Moreover, since entertainment provides its audience with the opportunity to symbolically arrange the environment, mood management theory states that people's entertainment choices should similarly serve the management of moods (Oliver, 2003).

The specific hypotheses of mood management theory have been summarized as follows by Zillmann (2000):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The indicated hedonistic objective is best served by selective exposure to material that (a) is excitationally opposite to prevailing states associated with noxiously experienced hypo- or hyperarousal, (b) has positive hedonic value above that of prevailing states, and (c) in hedonically negative states, has little or no semantic affinity with the prevailing states.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although mood management suggests that individuals' behaviors often conform to the hedonistic assumption, this theory also makes clear that individuals are not necessarily aware of their motivation. Rather, people are thought to initially arrange their environments in a random fashion, and arrangements that are incidentally made during good moods and that extend or enhance the hedonically positive state leave a memory trace that increases the likelihood for making similar stimulus arrangements under similar circumstances (Zillmann, 1988a, 1988b). In other words, the formation of these preferences is controlled by a mechanism called [[operant conditioning]], which refers to the use of consequences to modify the occurrence and form of behavior.

==Empirical evidence==
Although its principles relate to the broader realm of mood optimization, mood management theory has largely been applied to entertainment choices. Focusing on viewers' selection of television entertainment, for example, an experimental study by Bryant and Zillmann (1984) reveals that individuals can overcome boredom or stress through selective exposure to exciting or relaxing television programming respectively. In the context of music exposure, Knobloch and Zillmann (2002) demonstrate that individuals could improve negative moods by electing to listen to highly energetic-joyful music. Also, Wakshlag et al. (1983) reported that participants with increased fear levels preferred films with low victimization scores and with high justice scores. This demonstrates that individuals aim to minimize stimuli which are associated with the source of a negative mood.

==Challenges==
The theoretical proposition of mood management theory has been faced with challenges, especially when studying (1) the role that negative moods and burdening feelings play within the entertainment experience; (2) the diversity of individual users, social and cultural situations, and media products on offer, and (3) the new, so-called interactive media and how entertainment can best be conceptualized within them (Vorderer, 2003).

It is also called "cellular vampirism" as the predatory [[cell (biology)|cell]] pierces the [[cell wall]] and/or [[cell membrane]] of the prey cell with a feeding tube, the '''conoid''', sucks out the cellular content and digests it.

Myzocytosis is found in [[Myzozoa]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-5d35e684-a832-3187-bc57-5f3d2ba06a04&lt;/ref&gt; and also in some species of [[Ciliophora]] (both comprise the [[alveolate]]s). A classic example of myzocytosis is the feeding method of the infamous predatory ciliate, ''[[Didinium]]'', where it is often depicted devouring a hapless ''[[Paramecium]]''.  The [[suctoria]]n [[ciliate]]s were originally thought to have fed exclusively through myzocytosis, sucking out the cytoplasm of prey via superficially [[drinking straw]]-like pseudopodia.  It is now understood that suctorians do not feed through myzocytosis, but actually, instead, manipulate and envenomate captured prey with their tentacle-like pseudopodia.&lt;ref name=Rudzinska1973&gt;{{Cite journal| author1 = Rudzinska | first1 = M.

{{more footnotes|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Nightcart.gif|thumb|right|18th-century London nightman's calling card]]

'''Night soil''' is a historically used [[euphemism]] for [[Human waste|human excreta]] collected from [[cesspit|cesspools]], privies, [[pail closet]]s, [[pit latrine]]s, [[privy midden]]s, [[septic tank]]s, etc. This material was removed from the immediate area, usually at night, by workers employed in this trade. Sometimes it could be transported out of towns and sold on as a [[fertilizer]]. 

Another definition is "untreated excreta transported without water (e.g. via containers or buckets)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Sanitation safety planning: manual for safe use and disposal of wastewater, greywater and excreta.|author = Jackson, D| author2=Winkler, M| author3=Stenström, TA|publisher = World Health Organization|date=2015|isbn = 978 92 4 154924 0|url= http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/ssp-manual/en/|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "night soil" is largely an [[Archaism|archaic word]], used in historical contexts. The modern term is "fecal sludge"; [[fecal sludge management]] is an ongoing challenge, particularly in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="Tilley"&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-3-906484-57-0|url=http://www.sswm.info/sites/default/files/reference_attachments/TILLEY%20et%20al%202014%20Compendium%20of%20Sanitation%20Systems%20and%20Technologies%20-%202nd%20Revised%20Edition.pdf|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies|edition = 2nd Revised|author = Tilley, E.|author2 = Ulrich, L.|author3 = Lüthi, C.|author4 = Reymond, Ph.|author5 = Zurbrügg, C.|date=2014|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Night soil was produced as a result of a [[sanitation]] system in areas without [[Sewerage|sewer systems]] or [[septic tank]]s. In this system of waste management, the human feces are collected without dilution with water.

==Collection and disposal==
{{Main|Fecal sludge management}}
Feces were excreted into a container such as a [[chamber pot]], and sometimes collected in the container with urine and other waste ("slops", hence [[slopping out]]). The excrement in the pail was often covered with earth (soil), which may have contributed to the term "night soil." Often the deposition or excretion occurred within the residence, such as in a [[shophouse]]. This system may still be used in isolated rural areas or in urban slums in developing countries. The material was collected for temporary storage and disposed of depending on local custom.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Disposal has varied through time. In urban areas, a night soil collector arrived regularly, at varying time periods depending on the supply and demand for night soil collection. Usually this occurred during the night, giving the night soil its name.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In isolated rural areas such as in [[farm]]s, the [[household]] usually disposed of the night soil themselves.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Uses in agriculture==
{{Further|Reuse of excreta}}
Human excreta may be attractive as [[fertilizer]] because of the high demand for fertilizer and the relative availability of the material to create night soil. In areas where native soil is of poor quality, the local population may weigh the risk of using night soil.

The use of unprocessed human feces as fertilizer is a risky practice as it may contain [[Faecal-oral route|disease-causing pathogens]]. Nevertheless, in some developing nations it is still widespread. Common [[parasitic worm]] infections, such as [[ascariasis]], in these countries are linked to night soil use in agriculture, because the helminth eggs are in feces and can thus be transmitted from one infected person to another person ([[Fecal–oral route|fecal-oral transmission]] of disease).

These risks are reduced by proper [[fecal sludge management]], e.g. via [[compost]]ing. The safe reduction of [[human excreta]] into compost is possible. Some municipalities create [[compost]] from the [[sewage sludge]], but then recommend that it only be used on flower beds, not vegetable gardens. Some claims have been made that this is dangerous or inappropriate without the expensive removal of [[heavy metals]].

==History==

===Ancient Attica===
The use of sewage as fertilizer was common in ancient Attica. The sewage system of ancient Athens collected the sewage of the city in a large reservoir and then channelled it to the [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus river]] valley for use as fertilizer.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will, ''The Life of Greece'', PP. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

===China, Hong Kong, and Singapore===
[[File:China; a woman carrying buckets of night-soil. Wellcome L0056427.jpg|thumb|A woman carrying buckets of night-soil, photographed in 1871.]]
The term is known, or even infamous, among the generations that were born in parts of China or [[Chinatowns]] (depending on the development of the infrastructure) before 1960. Post-[[World War II]] [[Chinatown, Singapore]], before the [[history of Singapore|independence of Singapore]], utilized night-soil collection as a primary means of waste disposal, especially as much of the infrastructure was damaged and took a long time to rebuild following the [[Battle of Singapore]] and subsequent [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]]. Following the development of the economy and the [[standard of living]] after independence, the night soil system in Singapore is now merely a curious anecdote from the time of colonial rule when new systems developed.

The collection method is generally very manual and heavily relies on close human contact with the waste. During the Nationalist era when the [[Kuomintang]] ruled [[mainland China]], as well as Chinatown in Singapore, the night soil collector usually arrived with spare and relatively empty [[Bucket toilet|honey bucket]]s to exchange for the full honey buckets. The method of transporting the honey buckets from individual households to collection centers was very similar to delivering [[water supply|water supplies]] by an unskilled laborer, with the exception that the item being transported was not at all [[drinking water|potable]]  and it was being delivered ''from'' the household, rather than ''to'' the household. The collector would hang full honey buckets onto each end of a pole he carried on his shoulder and then proceeded to carry it through the streets until he reached the collection point.

Hong Kong has a similar euphemism for night soil collection, {{lang|zh|倒夜香}} ''dàoyèxiāng'', which literally means "emptying nocturnal fragrance".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

=== Japan ===

The reuse of [[Human feces|feces]] as fertilizer was common in Japan. In [[Edo]] city, compost merchants gathered feces to sell for farmers. That was good additional income for apartment owners. [[Human waste|Human excreta]] of rich people were sold at higher prices because their diet was better; presumably, more nutrients remained in their excreta. Various historic documents dating from the 9th century detail the disposal procedures for toilet waste.&lt;ref&gt;Ebrey, P., Walthall. A., &amp; Palias, J. (2006). Modern east asia: A cultural, social, &amp; political history. Houghton Mifflin Company. Boston &amp; New York. p. 337&lt;/ref&gt;

Selling human waste products as fertilizers became much less common after [[World War II]], both for sanitary reasons and because of the proliferation of chemical fertilizers, and less than 1% is used for night soil fertilization{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}. The presence of the [[Occupation of Japan|United States occupying force]], by whom the use of human waste as fertilizer was seen as unhygienic and suspect, was also a contributing factor: "the Occupationaires condemned the practice, and tried to prevent their compatriots from eating vegetables and fruit from the local markets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/japan/2_7_photos.html|title=Pictures|publisher=[[Ohio State University]]|accessdate=4 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615140135/http://library.osu.edu/sites/rarebooks/japan/2_7_photos.html|archivedate=15 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico and Central America===
Various [[Mesoamerican]] civilizations used human feces to fertilize their crops. The Aztecs, in particular, are well known for their famous [[chinampa]]s, artificial islands made of mud and human waste used to grow crops that could be harvested up to 7 times a year. Current research has placed the origins of chinampas in an Aztec town of [[Colhuacan (altepetl)|Culhuacan]] in the year 1100 C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Blanton, "Prehispanic Settlement Patterns of the Ixtapalapa Peninsula Region, Mexico."

A [[gong farmer]] was the term used in Tudor England for a person employed to remove human excrement from privies and cesspits.  Gong farmers were only allowed to work at night and the waste they collected had to be taken outside the city or town boundaries.

The rapid industrialisation of England during the nineteenth century led to mass urbanisation, over-crowding, and epidemics. One response was the development of the "Rochdale system", in which the town council arranged for the collection of the night soil from the outhouse attached to each dwelling or group of dwellings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calow|first1=Dennis|title=Home Sweet Home: A century of Leicester housing 1814-1914|date=2007|publisher=Univ of Leicester|url=http://cdm15407.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15407coll5/id/1181|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[pail closet]]). A later response was the passage of the [[Public Health Act 1875]], which led to the creation of [[Byelaw terraced house|byelaws regarding housing]], mandating one outhouse per house. These were still "earth closets" (not water closets i.e. WCs) and so still depended on the "night soil men" or "nightmen".

== Current examples ==

===India===
People responsible for the disposal of night soil are considered [[Dalit|untouchables]] in India. The practice of untouchability was banned by law when India gained independence, but the tradition widely persists as the law is difficult to enforce.  This "[[manual scavenging]]" is now illegal in all Indian states.

The Indian government's Union Ministry for Social Justice and Empowerment stated in 2003 that 676,000 people were employed in the manual collection of human waste in India. Social organizations have estimated that up to 1.3 million Indians collect such waste. Further, workers in the collection of human waste were confined to marriage amongst themselves, thereby leading to a waste-collecting caste, which passes its profession on from generation to generation.

Employment of Manual Scavengers and Creation of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act 1993 has made manual scavenging illegal.

=== Japan ===
Modern Japan still has areas with ongoing night soil collection and disposal. The Japanese name for the "outhouse within the house" style toilet, where night soil is collected for disposal, is ''kumitori benjo'' (汲み取り便所). The proper disposal or [[recycling]] of sewage remains an important research area that is highly political.

'''Nuclear fission products''' are the atomic fragments left after a large atomic nucleus undergoes [[nuclear fission]]. Typically, a large [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] like that of [[uranium]] fissions by splitting into two smaller nuclei, along with a few [[neutron]]s, the release of heat energy ([[kinetic energy]] of the nuclei), and [[gamma ray]]s. The two smaller nuclei are the ''fission products''. (See also [[Fission products (by element)]]).

About 0.2% to 0.4% of fissions are [[ternary fission]]s, producing a third light nucleus such as [[helium-4]] (90%) or [[tritium]] (7%).

The fission products themselves are usually unstable and therefore radioactive; due to being relatively neutron-rich for their atomic number, many of them quickly undergo [[beta decay]].  This releases additional energy in the form of [[beta particle]]s, [[antineutrino]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s.  Thus, fission events normally result in beta and gamma radiation, even though this radiation is not produced directly by the fission event itself.

The produced [[nuclides|radionuclides]] have varying [[half-life|half-lives]], and therefore vary in [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]]. For instance, [[Isotopes of strontium|strontium-89]] and  strontium-90 are produced in similar quantities in fission, and each nucleus decays by [[beta particle|beta]] emission.  But &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr has a 30-year half-life, and &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr a 50.5-day half-life. Thus in the 50.5 days it takes half the &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr atoms to decay, emitting the same number of beta particles as there were decays, less than 0.4% of the &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr atoms have decayed, emitting only 0.4% of the betas.  The radioactive emission rate is highest for the shortest lived radionuclides, although they also decay the fastest. Additionally, less stable fission products are less likely to decay to stable nuclides, instead decaying to other radionuclides, which undergo further decay and radiation emission, adding to the radiation output.  It is these short lived fission products that are the immediate hazard of spent fuel, and the energy output of the radiation also generates significant heat which must be considered when storing spent fuel.  As there are hundreds of different radionuclides created, the initial radioactivity level fades quickly as short lived radionuclides decay, but never ceases completely as longer lived radionuclides make up more and more of the remaining unstable atoms.&lt;ref&gt;F. William Walker, Dr. George J. Kirouac, Francis M. Rourke. 1977. ''Chart of the Nuclides'', twelfth edition. Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory, General Electric Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation and decay ==
The sum of the [[atomic mass]] of the two atoms produced by the fission of one [[fissile]] [[atom]] is always less than the atomic mass of the original atom. This is because some of the mass is lost as free [[neutron]]s, and once kinetic energy of the fission products has been removed (i.e., the products have been cooled to extract the heat provided by the reaction), then the mass associated with this energy is lost to the system also, and thus appears to be "missing" from the cooled fission products.

Since the nuclei that can readily undergo fission are particularly neutron-rich (e.g. 61% of the [[nucleon]]s in [[uranium-235]] are neutrons), the initial fission products are often more neutron-rich than stable nuclei of the same mass as the fission product (e.g. stable [[zirconium]]-90 is 56% neutrons compared to unstable [[strontium]]-90 at 58%). The initial fission products therefore may be unstable and typically undergo [[beta decay]]  to move towards a stable configuration, converting a neutron to a [[proton]] with each beta emission. (Fission products do not decay via [[alpha decay]].)

A few neutron-rich and short-lived initial fission products decay by ordinary beta decay (this is the source of perceptible half life, typically a few tenths of a second to a few seconds), followed by immediate emission of a neutron by the excited daughter-product. This process is the source of so-called [[delayed neutron]]s, which play an important role in control of a [[nuclear reactor]].

The first beta decays are rapid and may release high energy [[beta particle]]s or [[gamma radiation]]. However, as the fission products approach stable nuclear conditions, the last one or two decays may have a long [[half-life]] and release less energy.

==Radioactivity over time==
Fission products have half-lives of 90 years ([[samarium-151]]) or less, except for seven [[long-lived fission product]]s that have half lives of 211,100 years ([[technetium-99]]) and more. Therefore, the total radioactivity of a mixture of pure fission products decreases rapidly for the first several hundred years (controlled by the short-lived products) before stabilizing at a low level that changes little for hundreds of thousands of years (controlled by the seven long-lived products).

This behavior of pure fission products with actinides removed, contrasts with the decay of fuel that still contains [[actinides]]. This fuel is produced in the so-called "open" (i.e., no [[nuclear reprocessing]]) [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. A number of these actinides have half lives in the missing range of about 100 to 200,000 years, causing some difficulty with storage plans in this time-range for open cycle non-reprocessed fuels.

Proponents of nuclear fuel cycles which aim to consume all their actinides by fission, such as the [[Integral Fast Reactor]] and [[molten salt reactor]], use this fact to claim that within 200 years, their fuel wastes are no more radioactive than the original [[uranium ore]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20071009064447/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/designs/ifr/anlw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fission products emit [[beta radiation]], while actinides primarily emit [[alpha radiation]]. Many of each also emit [[gamma radiation]].

== Yield ==
{{Main article|Fission product yield}}

[[Image:ThermalFissionYield.svg|thumb|350px|Fission product yields by mass for [[thermal neutron]] fission of [[Uranium-235|U-235]], [[Pu-239]], a combination of the two typical of current nuclear power reactors, and [[Uranium-233|U-233]] used in the [[thorium cycle]].]]

Each fission of a parent atom produces a different set of fission product atoms.  However, while an individual fission is not predictable, the fission products are statistically predictable.  The amount of any particular isotope produced per fission is called its yield, typically expressed as percent per parent fission; therefore, yields total to just over 200% (because of [[ternary fission]]s), not 100%.

While fission products include every element from [[zinc]] through the [[lanthanides]], the majority of the fission products occur in two peaks. One peak occurs at about (expressed by atomic number) [[strontium]] to [[ruthenium]] while the other peak is at about [[tellurium]] to [[neodymium]].  The yield is somewhat dependent on the parent atom and also on the energy of the initiating neutron.

In general the higher the energy of the state that undergoes nuclear fission, the more likely that the two fission products have similar mass.  Hence as the neutron energy increases and/or the energy of the [[fissile]] atom increases, the valley between the two peaks becomes more shallow.&lt;ref&gt;http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v75/i1/p17_1&lt;/ref&gt;
For instance, the curve of yield against mass for [[Pu-239]] has a more shallow valley than that observed for [[Uranium-235|U-235]] when the neutrons are [[thermal neutron]]s. The curves for the fission of the later [[actinides]] tend to make even more shallow valleys. In extreme cases such as [[fermium-259|&lt;sup&gt;259&lt;/sup&gt;Fm]], only one peak is seen.

The adjacent figure shows a typical fission product distribution from the fission of uranium. Note that in the calculations used to make this graph, the activation of fission products was ignored and the fission was assumed to occur in a single moment rather than a length of time. In this bar chart results are shown for different cooling times — time after fission.
Because of the stability of nuclei with even numbers of protons and/or neutrons, the curve of yield against element is not a smooth curve but tends to alternate. Note that the curve against mass number is smooth.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Fission Yield "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/nuctek/fissionyield.html|title=Nuclear Fission Yield |accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
Small amounts of fission products are naturally formed as the result of either [[spontaneous fission]] of natural uranium, which occurs at a low rate, or as a result of neutrons from [[radioactive decay]] or reactions with [[cosmic ray]] particles.  The microscopic tracks left by these fission products in some natural minerals (mainly [[apatite]] and  [[zircon]]) are used in [[fission track dating]] to provide the cooling (crystallization) ages of natural rocks.  The technique has an effective [[absolute dating|dating]] range of 0.1 Ma to &gt;1.0 Ga depending on the mineral used and the concentration of uranium in that mineral.

About 1.5 billion years ago in a uranium ore body in Africa, a [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] operated for a few hundred thousand years and produced approximately 5 tonnes of fission products.  These fission products were important in providing proof that the natural reactor had occurred.
Fission products are produced in [[nuclear weapon]] explosions, with the amount depending on the type of weapon.
The largest source of fission products is from [[nuclear reactor]]s.  In current [[nuclear power]] reactors, about 3% of the uranium in the fuel is converted into fission products as a by-product of energy generation.  Most of these fission products remain in the fuel unless there is [[fuel element failure]] or a [[nuclear accident]], or the fuel is [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]].

=== Power reactors ===
{{see also|Spent nuclear fuel}}
In commercial [[nuclear reactor|nuclear fission reactor]]s, the system is operated in the otherwise self-extinguishing [[Nuclear_reactor_physics#Delayed_neutrons_and_controllability|prompt subcritical]] state. The reactor specific physical phenomena that nonetheless maintains the temperature above the [[decay heat]] level, are the predictably delayed,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.nuceng.ca/ep6p3/class/Module3B_ReactorKineticsJun21.pdf Elementary physics of reactor control, Reactor kinetics]&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore easily controlled, transformations or movements of a vital class of fission product, or reaction ember, as they decay,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/fission/ Delayed neutrons are emitted by neutron rich fission fragments that are called the delayed neutron precursors.]&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Bromine-87]] being one such long-lived "ember", with a half-life of about a minute and thus it emits a ''delayed'' neutron upon decay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearpowertraining.tpub.com/h1019v1/css/Prompt-And-Delayed-Neutrons-133.htm PROMPT AND DELAYED NEUTRONS]&lt;/ref&gt;  Operating in this [[Nuclear reactor physics|delayed critical]] state, the dependence on the inherently delayed transformation or movement of fission products/[[ember]]s to maintain the temperature, is a process that occurs slow enough to permit human feedback on the temperature control. In an analogous manner to [[fire damper]]s varying the opening to control the movement of wood embers towards new fuel, [[control rod]]s are comparatively varied up or down, as the nuclear [[burnup|fuel burns up]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclear-power.net/nuclear-power/fission/prompt-neutrons/ Prompt and Delayed Neutrons ''The fact the neutron is produced via this type of decay and this happens orders of magnitude later compared to the emission of the prompt neutrons, plays an extremely important role in the control of the reactor.'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clpgroup.com/NuclearEnergy/Eng/science/science3_1_1.aspx "In view of the very low concentration of Uranium used, it is not possible for a commercial nuclear reactor to explode like an atomic bomb from the perspective of physics. A good analogy would be to compare alcoholic spirits to beer. Alcoholic spirits, such as Vodka, typically have a 40% alcohol content, and are highly flammable. Beer, which generally has an alcohol content of less than 5%, does not burn."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metamia.com/analogize.php?q=nuclear METAMIA is a free database of analogy and metaphor.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuclearconnect.org/know-nuclear/talking-nuclear/top-10-myths-about-nuclear-energy nuclear education for K-12 students Myths About Nuclear Energy  ''It is impossible for a reactor to explode like a nuclear weapon; these weapons contain very special materials in very particular configurations, neither of which are present in a nuclear reactor''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a nuclear power reactor, the main sources of radioactivity are fission products, alongside [[actinide]]s and [[activation product]]s.  Fission products are the largest source of radioactivity for the first several hundred years, while actinides are dominant roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; years after fuel use.

Fission occurs in the nuclear fuel, and the fission products are primarily retained within the fuel close to where they are produced.  These fission products are important to the operation of the reactor because some fission products contribute delayed neutrons that are useful for reactor control while others are neutron poisons that tend to inhibit the nuclear reaction.  The buildup of the fission product poisons is a key factor in determining [[burnup|the maximum duration a given fuel element can be kept within the reactor]].  The decay of short-lived fission products also provide a source of heat within the fuel that continues even after the reactor has been shut down and the fission reactions stopped.  It is this [[decay heat]] that sets the requirements for cooling of a reactor after shutdown.

If the fuel [[Cladding (nuclear fuel)|cladding]] around the fuel develops holes, then fission products can leak into the primary [[coolant]]. Depending on the fission product chemistry, it may settle within the [[reactor core]] or travel through the coolant system.  Coolant systems include chemistry control systems that tend to remove such fission products. In a well-designed power reactor running under normal conditions, the radioactivity of the coolant is very low.

It is known that the isotope responsible for the majority of the gamma exposure in [[nuclear reprocessing|fuel reprocessing]] plants (and the Chernobyl site in 2005) is [[Cs-137]]. [[Iodine-129]] is one of the major radioactive elements released from reprocessing plants. In nuclear reactors both Cs-137 and [[strontium-90]] are found in locations remote from the [[fuel]].  This is because these isotopes are formed by the [[beta decay]] of [[noble gas]]es ([[xenon-137]] {halflife of 3.8 minutes} and [[krypton-90]] {halflife 32 seconds}) which enable these isotopes to be deposited in locations remote from the fuel (e.g. on [[control rod]]s).

==== Nuclear reactor poisons ====
{{Main article|Nuclear poison|Iodine pit}}
Some fission products decay with the release of a neutron.  Since there may be a short delay in time between the original fission event (which releases its own [[prompt neutron]]s immediately) and the release of these neutrons, the latter are termed "[[delayed neutron]]s".  These delayed neutrons are important to nuclear reactor control.

Some of the fission products, such as [[xenon-135]] and [[samarium-149]], have a high neutron absorption [[Neutron cross section|cross section]]. Since a nuclear reactor depends on a balance in the neutron production and absorption rates, those fission products that remove neutrons from the reaction will tend to shut the reactor down or "poison" the reactor. Nuclear fuels and reactors are designed to address this phenomenon through such features as burnable poisons and control rods. Build-up of xenon-135 during shutdown or low-power operation may poison the reactor enough to [[iodine pit|impede restart]] or to interfere with normal control of the reaction during restart or restoration of full power, possibly causing or contributing to an [[Chernobyl disaster#Experiment and explosion|accident scenario]].

=== Nuclear weapons ===
[[Nuclear weapon]]s use fission as either the partial or the main energy source.  Depending on the weapon design and where it is exploded, the relative importance of the fission product radioactivity will vary compared to the activation product radioactivity in the total fallout radioactivity.

The immediate fission products from nuclear weapon fission are essentially the same as those from any other fission source, depending slightly on the particular nuclide that is fissioning.  However, the very short time scale for the reaction makes a difference in the particular mix of isotopes produced from an atomic bomb.

For example, the &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs/&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs ratio provides an easy method of distinguishing between fallout from a bomb and the fission products from a power reactor. Almost no [[Cs-134]] is formed by nuclear fission (because [[xenon]]-134 is stable). The &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is formed by the [[neutron activation]] of the stable &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs which is formed by the decay of isotopes in the [[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]] (A = 133). So in a momentary criticality by the time that the [[neutron]] flux becomes zero too little time will have passed for any &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs to be present. While in a power reactor plenty of time exists for the decay of the isotopes in the [[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]] to form &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs, the &lt;sup&gt;133&lt;/sup&gt;Cs thus formed can then be activated to form &lt;sup&gt;134&lt;/sup&gt;Cs only if the time between the start and the end of the criticality is long.

According to Jiri Hala's textbook,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Radioactivity, Ionizing Radiation, and Nuclear Energy
 |last=Hala |first=Jiri |authorlink= |author2=James D. Navratil  |year=2003 |publisher=Konvoj |location=Brno |isbn=80-7302-053-X |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the radioactivity in the fission product mixture in an [[atom bomb]] is mostly caused by short-lived isotopes such as [[Iodine-131|I-131]] and [[Barium|Ba]]-140. After about four months [[Cerium|Ce]]-141, [[Zirconium|Zr]]-95/[[Niobium|Nb]]-95, and [[Strontium|Sr]]-89 represent the largest share of radioactive material. After two to three years, [[Cerium|Ce]]-144/[[Praseodymium|Pr]]-144, [[Ruthenium|Ru]]-106/[[Rhodium|Rh]]-106, and [[Promethium-147]] are the bulk of the radioactivity. After a few years, the radiation is dominated by [[strontium-90]] and [[caesium-137]], whereas in the period between 10,000 and a million years it is [[technetium]]-99 that dominates.

===Application===
Some fission products (such as [[Cs-137]]) are used in medical and industrial [[radioactive source]]s.
&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;TcO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion can react with steel surfaces to form a [[Passivation (chemistry)|corrosion resistant layer]]. In this way these metaloxo anions act as [[anode|anodic]] [[corrosion inhibitor]]s - it renders the steel surface passive. The formation of [[technetium(IV) oxide|&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;TcO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] on [[steel]] surfaces is one effect which will retard the release of &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc from [[nuclear waste]] drums and nuclear equipment which has become lost prior to [[decontamination]] (e.g. [[nuclear submarine]] reactors which have been lost at sea).

In a similar way the release of radio-iodine in a serious power reactor accident could be retarded by [[adsorption]] on metal surfaces within the nuclear plant.&lt;ref&gt;H. Glänneskog.

== Decay ==

[[Image:AirDoseChernobylVector.svg|thumb|300px|The portion of the total radiation dose (in air) contributed by each isotope versus time after the [[Chernobyl disaster]], at the site thereof. Note that this image was drawn using data from the OECD report, and the second edition of 'The radiochemical manual'.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Data Evaluation Lab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atom.kaeri.re.kr/|title=Nuclear Data Evaluation Lab|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

For fission of [[uranium-235]], the predominant radioactive fission products include isotopes of [[iodine]], [[caesium]], [[strontium]], [[xenon]] and [[barium]]. The threat becomes smaller with the passage of time. Locations where radiation fields once posed immediate mortal threats, such as much of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]] on day one of the [[Chernobyl disaster|accident]] and the [[ground zero]] sites of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|U.S. atomic bombings in Japan]] (6 hours after detonation) are now relatively safe because the radioactivity has decayed to a low level.
Many of the fission products decay through very short-lived isotopes to form [[stable isotope]]s, but a considerable number of the [[radioisotope]]s have [[half-life|half-lives]] longer than a day.

The radioactivity in the fission product mixture is initially mostly caused by short lived isotopes such as [[Iodine-131]] and &lt;sup&gt;140&lt;/sup&gt;Ba; after about four months &lt;sup&gt;141&lt;/sup&gt;Ce, &lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Zr/&lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Nb and &lt;sup&gt;89&lt;/sup&gt;Sr take the largest share, while after about two or three years the largest share is taken by &lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Ce/&lt;sup&gt;144&lt;/sup&gt;Pr, &lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Ru/&lt;sup&gt;106&lt;/sup&gt;Rh and &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Pm. Later &lt;sup&gt;90&lt;/sup&gt;Sr and &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs are the main radioisotopes, being succeeded by &lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt;Tc. In the case of a release of radioactivity from a power reactor or used fuel, only some elements are released; as a result, the isotopic signature of the radioactivity is very different from an open air [[nuclear detonation]], where all the fission products are dispersed.

== Fallout countermeasures ==
The purpose of radiological emergency preparedness is to protect people from the effects of radiation exposure after a nuclear accident or bomb. [[emergency evacuation|Evacuation]] is the most effective protective measure. However, if evacuation is impossible or even uncertain, then local [[fallout shelters]] and other measures provide the best protection.&lt;ref&gt;C. Kearney, Nuclear War Survival Skills, Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, http://www.oism.org/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--REPETITIVE. AND DEADLINKED...The mixture of radioactive fission products found in the [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] from a [[nuclear bomb]] are very different in nature to those found in spent power [[Nuclear reactor technology|reactor]] fuel. This is because the reactor fuel will have had more time for the short lived isotopes to decay, and because for many accident types the volatile elements are liberated while the [[refractory|involatiles]] are retained at the accident site. As a result the contribution of many short-lived (e.g. &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Zr) and/or involatiles is less for accident fallout than it is bomb fallout.  A definitive report on Chernobyl is at [http://www.nea.fr/html/rp/chernobyl/allchernobyl.html] - Chapter 2, Table 1 lists the radioisotopes released in the fire. The percentage of the inventory which was released was controlled largely by how volatile the fission product is. Hence a greater proportion of [[xenon]] and [[iodine]] were released than of [[cerium]] and [[plutonium]].

For the longer term response, a review of the methods that can be used to decontaminate an urban environment is provided in the scope report [http://www.icsu-scope.org/downloadpubs/scope50/chapter06.html Behaviour and Decontamination of Artificial Radionuclides in the Urban Environment].

=== Iodine ===
[[Image:US fallout exposure.png|right|250px|thumb|Per capita thyroid doses in the continental United States of [[iodine-131]] resulting from all exposure routes from all atmospheric nuclear tests conducted at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. See also [[Downwinders]].]]
At least three [[isotopes of iodine]] are important. [[Iodine-129|&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I]], [[Iodine-131|&lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;I]] (radioiodine) and &lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;I. Open air [[nuclear test]]ing and the [[Chernobyl disaster]] both released iodine-131.

The short-lived [[isotope]]s of iodine are particularly harmful because the [[thyroid]] collects and concentrates [[iodide]] – radioactive as well as stable. Absorption of radioiodine can lead to acute, chronic, and delayed effects. Acute effects from high doses include [[thyroiditis]], while chronic and delayed effects include [[hypothyroidism]], [[thyroid nodule]]s, and [[thyroid cancer]]. It has been shown that the active iodine released from [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Kyshtym Disaster|Mayak]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Mushkacheva, E. Rabinovich, V. Privalov, S. Povolotskaya, V. Shorokhova, S. Sokolova, V. Turdakova, E. Ryzhova, P. Hall, A. B. Schneider, D. L. Preston, and E. Ron, "Thyroid Abnormalities Associated with Protracted Childhood Exposure to 131I from Atmospheric Emissions from the Mayak Weapons Facility in Russia", ''Radiation Research'', 2006, '''166'''(5), 715-722&lt;/ref&gt; has resulted in an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in the former [[Soviet Union]].

One measure which protects against the risk from radio-iodine is taking a dose of [[potassium iodide]] (KI) before exposure to radioiodine.  The non-radioactive iodide 'saturates' the thyroid, causing less of the radioiodine to be stored in the body.
Administering potassium iodide reduces the effects of radio-iodine by 99% and is a prudent, inexpensive supplement to [[fallout shelter]]s. A low-cost alternative to commercially available iodine pills is a [[saturated solution]] of potassium iodide. Long-term storage of KI is normally in the form of [[Reagent#Reagent grade|reagent grade]] crystals.&lt;ref&gt;C. Kearney, Nuclear War Survival Skills (Ch. 13), Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, http://www.oism.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of known [[goitrogen]] substances can also be used as a [[prophylaxis]] in reducing the bio-uptake of iodine, (whether it be the nutritional non-radioactive [[iodine-127]] or radioactive iodine, radioiodine - most commonly [[iodine-131]], as the body cannot discern between different iodine [[isotopes]]).
[[Perchlorate]] ions, a common water contaminant in the USA due to the [[aerospace industry]], has been shown to reduce iodine uptake and thus is classified as a [[goitrogen]]. Perchlorate ions are a competitive inhibitor of the process by which iodide is actively deposited into thyroid follicular cells. Studies involving healthy adult volunteers determined that at levels above 0.007 milligrams per kilogram per day (mg/(kg·d)), perchlorate begins to temporarily inhibit the thyroid gland’s ability to absorb iodine from the bloodstream ("iodide uptake inhibition", thus perchlorate is a known goitrogen).&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.02110927 |title=Health Effects Assessment for Environmental Perchlorate Contamination: The Dose Response for Inhibition of Thyroidal Radioiodine Uptake in Humans |year=2002 |last1=Greer |first1=Monte A. |last2=Goodman |first2=Gay |last3=Pleus |first3=Richard C. |last4=Greer |first4=Susan E. |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=110 |issue=9 |pages=927–37 |pmid=12204829 |pmc=1240994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The reduction of the iodide pool by perchlorate has dual effects – reduction of excess hormone synthesis and hyperthyroidism, on the one hand, and reduction of thyroid inhibitor synthesis and hypothyroidism on the other. Perchlorate remains very useful as a single dose application in tests measuring the discharge of radioiodide accumulated in the thyroid as a result of many different disruptions in the further metabolism of iodide in the thyroid gland.&lt;ref name="ncbi"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9549759 |year=1998 |last1=Wolff |first1=J |title=Perchlorate and the thyroid gland |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=89–105 |journal=Pharmacological Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Treatment of thyrotoxicosis (including Graves' disease) with 600-2,000&amp;nbsp;mg potassium perchlorate (430-1,400&amp;nbsp;mg perchlorate) daily for periods of several months or longer was once common practice, particularly in Europe,&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=4290684 |year=1966 |last1=Barzilai |first1=D |last2=Sheinfeld |first2=M |title=Fatal complications following use of potassium perchlorate in thyrotoxicosis. Report of two cases and a review of the literature |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=453–6 |journal=Israel journal of medical sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; and perchlorate use at lower doses to treat thryoid problems continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00108-005-1508-4 |title=Therapie und Prävention der Hyperthyreose |trans-title=Therapy and prevention of hyperthyroidism |language=German |year=2005 |last1=Woenckhaus |first1=U. |last2=Girlich |first2=C. |journal=Der Internist |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1318–23 |pmid=16231171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although 400&amp;nbsp;mg of potassium perchlorate divided into four or five daily doses was used initially and found effective, higher doses were introduced when 400&amp;nbsp;mg/day was discovered not to control thyrotoxicosis in all subjects.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

Current regimens for treatment of [[thyrotoxicosis]] (including Graves' disease), when a patient is exposed to additional sources of iodine, commonly include 500&amp;nbsp;mg potassium perchlorate twice per day for 18–40 days.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi_a"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1210/jc.81.8.2930 |title=Treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, a difficult challenge: Results of a prospective study |year=1996 |last1=Bartalena |first1=L. |journal=Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism |volume=81 |issue=8 |pmid=8768854 |pages=2930–3 |last2=Brogioni |first2=S |last3=Grasso |first3=L |last4=Bogazzi |first4=F |last5=Burelli |first5=A |last6=Martino |first6=E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prophylaxis with perchlorate-containing water at concentrations of 17 [[Parts per million|ppm]], which corresponds to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg-day personal intake, if one is 70&amp;nbsp;kg and consumes 2 litres of water per day, was found to reduce baseline radioiodine uptake by 67%&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt; This is equivalent to ingesting a total of just 35&amp;nbsp;mg of perchlorate ions per day. In another related study where subjects drank just 1 litre of perchlorate-containing water per day at a concentration of 10 ppm, i.e. daily 10&amp;nbsp;mg of perchlorate ions were ingested, an average 38% reduction in the uptake of iodine was observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/10507250050137734 |title=The Effect of Short-Term Low-Dose Perchlorate on Various Aspects of Thyroid Function |year=2000 |last1=Lawrence |first1=J. E. |last2=Lamm |first2=S. H. |last3=Pino |first3=S. |last4=Richman |first4=K. |last5=Braverman |first5=L. E. |journal=Thyroid |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=659–63 |pmid=11014310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when the average perchlorate absorption in perchlorate plant workers subjected to the highest exposure has been estimated as approximately 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg-day, as in the above paragraph, a 67% reduction of iodine uptake would be expected. Studies of chronically exposed workers though have thus far failed to detect any abnormalities of thyroid function, including the uptake of iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00043764-199904000-00006 |title=Thyroid Health Status of Ammonium Perchlorate Workers: A Cross-Sectional Occupational Health Study |year=1999 |last1=Lamm |first1=Steven H. |last2=Braverman |first2=Lewis E. |last3=Li |first3=Feng Xiao |last4=Richman |first4=Kent |last5=Pino |first5=Sam |last6=Howearth |first6=Gregory |journal=Journal of Occupational &amp; Environmental Medicine |volume=41 |issue=4 |pmid=10224590 |pages=248–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; this may well be attributable to sufficient daily exposure or intake of healthy iodine-127 among the workers and the short 8 hr [[biological half life]] of perchlorate in the body.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

To completely block the uptake of iodine-131 by the purposeful addition of perchlorate ions to a populace's water supply, aiming at dosages of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg-day, or a water concentration of 17 ppm, would therefore be grossly inadequate at truly reducing radioiodine uptake. Perchlorate ion concentrations in a region's water supply would need to be much higher, at least 7.15&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of body weight per day, or a water concentration of 250 [[Parts per million|ppm]], assuming people drink 2 liters of water per day, to be truly beneficial to the population at preventing [[bioaccumulation]] when exposed to a radioiodine environment,&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ncbi_a" /&gt; independent of the availability of [[iodate]] or [[iodide]] drugs.

The continual distribution of perchlorate tablets or the addition of perchlorate to the water supply would need to continue for no less than 80–90 days, beginning immediately after the initial release of radioiodine was detected. After 80–90 days passed, released radioactive iodine-131 would have decayed to less than 0.1% of its initial quantity, at which time the danger from biouptake of iodine-131 is essentially over.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/nuclear-chemistry-halflives-and-radioactive-dating.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the event of a radioiodine release, the ingestion of prophylaxis potassium iodide, if available, or even iodate, would rightly take precedence over perchlorate administration, and would be the first line of defense in protecting the population from a radioiodine release. However, in the event of a radioiodine release too massive and widespread to be controlled by the limited stock of iodide and iodate prophylaxis drugs, then the addition of perchlorate ions to the water supply, or distribution of perchlorate tablets would serve as a cheap, efficacious, second line of defense against [[carcinogenic]] radioiodine bioaccumulation.

The ingestion of goitrogen drugs is, much like potassium iodide also not without its dangers, such as [[hypothyroidism]]. In all these cases however, despite the risks, the prophylaxis benefits of intervention with iodide, iodate, or perchlorate outweigh the serious cancer risk from radioiodine bioaccumulation in regions where radioiodine has sufficiently contaminated the environment.

=== Cesium ===
The Chernobyl accident released a large amount of [[isotopes of cesium|cesium isotopes]] which were dispersed over a wide area. &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is an isotope which is of long-term concern as it remains in the top layers of soil.  Plants with shallow root systems tend to absorb it for many years. Hence grass and mushrooms can carry a considerable amount of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs, which can be transferred to humans through the [[food chain]].

One of the best countermeasures in [[dairy farming]] against &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is to mix up the soil by deeply ploughing the soil. This has the effect of putting the &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs out of reach of the shallow roots of the grass, hence the level of radioactivity in the grass will be lowered. Also the removal of top few centimeters of soil and its burial in a shallow trench will reduce the dose to humans and animals as the gamma [[photon]]s from &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs will be attenuated by their passage through the soil.  The deeper and more remote the trench is, the better the degree of protection.
[[Fertilizer]]s containing [[potassium]] can be used to dilute cesium and limit its uptake by plants.

In [[livestock]] farming, another countermeasure against &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is to feed to animals [[prussian blue]]. This compound acts as an [[ion-exchanger]]. The [[cyanide]] is so tightly bonded to the iron that it is safe for a human to consume several grams of prussian blue per day. The prussian blue reduces the [[biological half-life]] (different from the [[half-life|nuclear half-life]]) of the cesium. The physical or nuclear half-life of &lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs is about 30 years. Cesium in humans normally has a biological half-life of between one and four months. An added advantage of the prussian blue is that the cesium which is stripped from the animal in the droppings is in a form which is not available to plants. Hence it prevents the cesium from being recycled. The form of prussian blue required for the treatment of animals, including humans is a special grade.  Attempts to use the [[pigment]] grade used in [[paint]]s have not been successful.&lt;ref&gt;For further details of the use of prussian blue please see the [[IAEA]] report on the [[Goiânia accident]].[http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub815_web.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strontium ===
The addition of [[Agricultural lime|lime]] to soils which are poor in [[calcium]] can reduce the uptake of [[strontium]] by plants.  Likewise in areas where the soil is low in [[potassium]], the addition of a potassium fertilizer can discourage the uptake of cesium into plants. However such treatments with either lime or [[potash]] should not be undertaken lightly as they can alter the [[soil chemistry]] greatly, so resulting in a change in the plant [[ecology]] of the land.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

For introduction of radionuclides into organism, ingestion is the most important route. Insoluble compounds are not absorbed from the gut and cause only local irradiation before they are excreted. Soluble forms however show wide range of absorption percentages.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=4HOGwg0YqwMC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=radioactive+fallout+particles+zirconium&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=29#v=onepage&amp;q=radioactive%20fallout%20particles%20zirconium&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pan Britannica Industries Ltd'''  ('''PBI''') was a small company which had 400 employees. It was a household and agrochemical formulation company based at Britannica House, Stewardstone Road, [[Waltham Cross]]  and with a distribution presence in [[Wisbech]] in [[Cambridgeshire]]. PBI was, in common with many other UK household names, both a manufacturer and marketing organisation for both agricultural and horticultural products.

PBI produced many agro-chemical formulations that were popular with farmers in many parts of the globe. However It was best known for its product [[Baby Bio]], a liquid plant food that came in a notable small perfume-shaped bottle. Other major products by PBI are the Expert range of books, such as the ''Garden Expert'', ''House Plant Expert'', ''Greenhouse Expert'' etc. written by, [[D.G. Hessayon|Dr D.G. Hessayon]], who later became chairman of PBI. The motto of these books is "''Easy-to-follow advice and information you can trust''". With this in mind they are colourful, informative, and contain accurate product information and literature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourhouseplants.com/guides/hessayon&lt;/ref&gt; The Company adopted this approach throughout all its products and brands. Such an approach was in no small way attributable to Dr. Hessayon, who was highly regarded within and outside both Agriculture and Horticulture, for many years.

The company was sold to the [[Sumitomo]] corporation in the late eighties, but continued to be run largely by the same management. It is now part of the [[Bayer]] Corporation, which markets the best of its brands. The Waltham Abbey site has been redeveloped into a housing estate. There is still a presence in Waltham Cross called PBI Home &amp; Garden Ltd in the same building, now renamed Durkan house.

Similar UK operations were run by ICI Agriculture, Murphy Chemical Co, Allbright &amp; Wilson (Farm Protection), Shell Chemical Company, BP and Fisons. Some small scale horticultural products were also packaged at the Waltham Abbey plant, including Draza Slug Pellets for Bayer Agriculture (now owner of the Bio Trade Mark). Companies such as [[Elanco]], [[DuPont]], [[Rohm &amp; Haas]] and [[Stauffer]] actually manufactured, packaged, and labelled the vast majority of Chemical marketed by PBI.

Many of the products which PBI marketed gave it, a very small player, a strong market presence on the global agrochemicals scene. Due to legislation, many of the products have been discontinued in [[Western world|the west]] due to long-term human health issues, but were considered safe and manufactured by other companies around the world. Now only the benign formulas like Baby Bio have continued availability.

Dr Hessayon still writes Expert books but these are now published by [[Transworld (company)|Transworld]].

== Cancer allegations ==

The company did have one negative brush with fame when its formulation plant in Waltham Abbey was alleged to be at the centre and therefore the cause of a cancer hotspot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/openup/chapters/0335218423.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This was highlighted by Storyline, an investigative television programme by [[Carlton Television]], in early 1993. Reports of an unusual occurrence of cancer around the plant and subsequent legal action taken by the residents were the basis for this programme, which was followed by several articles in the press.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/inquiry-is-sought-over-pesticide-cancer-fears-1470365.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The allegations were rejected by the then managing director, Mr. Jeremy Tear. No official body or agency then charged with the oversight of activities at the Waltham Abbey site had raised any concerns connected with the activity or safety procedures at the plant.

'''Photorealism''' is a genre of art that encompasses [[painting]], [[drawing]] and other graphic media, in which an artist studies a [[photograph]] and then attempts to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another [[Medium (arts)|medium]]. Although the term can be used broadly to describe artworks in many different media, it is also used to refer specifically to a group of paintings and painters of the American [[art movement]] that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

==History==

===Origins===
As a full-fledged art movement, Photorealism evolved from [[Pop Art]]&lt;ref name="Supperrealist Pop Art"&gt;Lindey (1980), pp. 27–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin&gt;[[Nochlin, Linda]], "The Realist Criminal and the Abstract Law II", ''Art In America.'' 61 (November–December 1973), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a counter to [[Abstract Expressionism]]&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin /&gt; as well as [[Minimal art|Minimalist art movements]]&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002. pp 14-15"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nochlin /&gt;&lt;ref name=fleming709 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Battock, Gregory 1980. pp 8-10"&gt;Battock, Gregory. Preface to [[Louis K. Meisel|Meisel, Louis K.]] (1980), ''Photorealism''. New York:[[Harry N. Abrams|Abrams]]. pp 8–10&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Battock, Gregory 1980. pp 8-10"/&gt;  Photorealists use a photograph or several photographs to gather the information to create their paintings and it can be argued that the use of a [[camera]] and photographs is an acceptance of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt; However, the admittance to the use of photographs in Photorealism was met with intense criticism when the movement began to gain momentum in the late 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that visual devices had been used since the fifteenth century to aid artists with their work.&lt;ref name="Scharf, Aaron"&gt;Scharf, Aaron (1969), ''Art and Photography'' Baltimore: Allan Lane, The Penguin Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of photography in the nineteenth century had three effects on art: portrait and scenic artists were deemed inferior to the photograph and many turned to photography as careers; within nineteenth- and twentieth-century art movements it is well documented that artists used the photograph as source material and as an aid—however, they went to great lengths to deny the fact fearing that their work would be misunderstood as imitations;&lt;ref name="Scharf, Aaron"/&gt; and through the photograph's invention artists were open to a great deal of new experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), pp. 11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the culmination of the invention of the photograph was a break in art's history towards the challenge facing the artist—since the earliest known cave drawings—trying to replicate the scenes they viewed.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;

By the time the Photorealists began producing their bodies of work the photograph had become the leading means of reproducing reality and abstraction was the focus of the art world.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, pp. 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] continued as an ongoing art movement, even experiencing a reemergence in the 1930s, but by the 1950s modernist critics and Abstract Expressionism had minimalized realism as a serious art undertaking.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;  Though Photorealists share some aspects of American realists, such as [[Edward Hopper]], they tried to set themselves as much apart from traditional realists as they did Abstract Expressionists.&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"&gt;Lindey (1980), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Photorealists were much more influenced by the work of [[Pop Art|Pop artists]] and were reacting against Abstract Expressionism.&lt;ref&gt;Lindey (1980), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop Art and Photorealism were both reactionary movements stemming from the ever-increasing and overwhelming abundance of photographic media, which by the mid 20th century had grown into such a massive phenomenon that it was threatening to lessen the value of imagery in art.&lt;ref name="Supperrealist Pop Art"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chase, p. 14"&gt;Chase, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prown 1977"&gt;Prown, Jules David and Rose, Barbara (1977), ''American Painting: From the Colonial Period to the Present''. New York:Rizzoli. {{ISBN|0847800490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, whereas the Pop artists were primarily pointing out the absurdity of much of the imagery (especially in commercial usage), the Photorealists were trying to reclaim and exalt the value of an image.&lt;ref name="Chase, p. 14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prown 1977"/&gt;

The association of Photorealism to ''[[Trompe L'oeil]]'' is a wrongly attributed comparison, an error in observation or interpretation made by many critics of the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fleming709&gt;Fleming, John and Honour, Hugh (1991), ''The Visual Arts: A History,'' 3rd Edition. New York: [[Harry N. Abrams|Abrams]]. p. 709. {{ISBN|0810939134}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Trompe L'oeil paintings attempt to "fool the eye" and make the viewer think he is seeing an actual object, not a painted one. When observing a Photorealist painting, the viewer is always aware that they are looking at a painting.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Superrealist 1"/&gt;

===Definition===
The word ''Photorealism'' was coined by [[Louis K. Meisel]]&lt;ref name="meiselgallery1"&gt;[http://www.meiselgallery.com/ Meiselgallery.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1969 and appeared in print for the first time in 1970 in a Whitney Museum catalogue for the show "Twenty-two Realists."&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12"&gt;Meisel (1989), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also sometimes labeled as Super-Realism, [[New Realism]], Sharp Focus Realism, or [[hyperrealism (painting)|Hyper-Realism]].&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12" /&gt;

Louis K. Meisel,&lt;ref name="meiselgallery1"/&gt; two years later, developed a five-point definition at the request of Stuart M. Speiser, who had commissioned a large collection of works by the Photorealists, which later developed into a traveling show known as 'Photo-Realism 1973: The Stuart M. Speiser Collection', which was donated to the [[Smithsonian]] in 1978 and is shown in several of its museums as well as traveling under the auspices of 'site'.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 12"/&gt;  The definition for the 'originators' was as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#  The Photo-Realist uses the camera and photograph to gather information.
#  The Photo-Realist uses a mechanical or semimechanical means to transfer the information to the canvas.
#  The Photo-Realist must have the technical ability to make the finished work appear photographic.
#  The artist must have exhibited work as a Photo-Realist by 1972 to be considered one of the central Photo-Realists.
#  The artist must have devoted at least five years to the development and exhibition of Photo-Realist work.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 13"&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Styles===
Photorealist painting cannot exist without the [[photograph]].  In Photorealism, change and movement must be frozen in time which must then be accurately represented by the artist.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980. p. 13"/&gt;  Photorealists gather their imagery and information with the camera and photograph. Once the photograph is developed (usually onto a photographic slide) the artist will systematically transfer the image from the photographic slide onto [[canvas]]es.  Usually this is done either by projecting the slide onto the canvas or by using traditional grid techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting images are often direct copies of the original photograph but are usually larger than the original photograph or slide.  This results in the photorealist style being tight and precise, often with an emphasis on imagery that requires a high level of technical prowess and [[virtuoso|virtuosity]] to simulate, such as [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]s in specular surfaces and the [[geometry|geometric]] rigor of man-made environs.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel (1980), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artists===
The first generation of American photorealists includes such painters as [[John Baeder]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Charles Bell (painter)|Charles Bell]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Don Eddy]], [[Robert Bechtle]],  and [[Tom Blackwell]].&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980"&gt;Meisel (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  Often working independently of each other and with widely different starting points, these original photorealists routinely tackled mundane or familiar subjects in traditional art genres--[[landscape]]s (mostly [[cityscape|urban]] rather than naturalistic), [[portrait]]s, and [[still life]]s.&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980"/&gt; In the UK, photorealist approaches were favoured by many artists including Mike Gorman and Eric Scott. The introduction of these European painters to a wider US audience was brought about through the 1982 'Superhumanism' exhibition at the Arnold Katzen Gallery, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Nora. (October 15, 2015) [http://onmywall.co/photorealism-technical-mastery-and-effortless-style/ "Photorealism - Technical Mastery and Effortless Style"] ''On My Wall''&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the movement is primarily associated with painting, [[Duane Hanson]] and [[John DeAndrea]] are [[sculptor]]s associated with photorealism for their painted, lifelike sculptures of average people that were complete with simulated [[hair]] and real clothes. They are called ''Verists.''&lt;ref name="Meisel, Louis K. 1980" /&gt;

===Since 2000===

[[File:Glennray Tutor 1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dream of Love'' (2005), Oil on canvas. Example of Photorealist [[Glennray Tutor]]'s work]]

Though the height of Photorealism was in the 1970s the movement continues and includes several of the original photorealists as well as many of their contemporaries.  According to Meisel and Chase's ''Photorealism at the Millennium'', only eight of the original photorealists were still creating photorealist work in 2002;&lt;ref&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; ten including [[John Baeder]] and Howard Kanovitz.

Artists Charles Bell, John Kacere, and Howard Kanovitz have died; Audrey Flack, Chuck Close, and Don Eddy have moved away from photorealism; and Robert Cottingham no longer considers himself a photorealist.

Newer Photorealists are building upon the foundations set by the original photorealists.  Examples would be the influence of Richard Estes in works by Anthony Brunelli or the influence of Ralph Goings and Charles Bell in works by [[Glennray Tutor]]. However, this has led many to move on from the strict definition of photorealism as the emulation of the photograph.  Photorealism is also no longer simply an American art movement. Starting with [[Franz Gertsch]] in the 1980s Clive Head, Raphaella Spence, Bertrand Meniel, and [[Roberto Bernardi]] are several European artists associated with photorealism that have emerged since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meisel, Millennium"/&gt; This internationalization of photorealism is also seen in photorealist events, such as [[The Prague Project]], in which American and non-American photorealist painters have traveled together to locations including Prague, Zurich, Monaco and New York, to work alongside each other in producing work.

The evolution of technology has brought forth photorealistic paintings that exceed what was thought possible with paintings; these newer paintings by the photorealists are sometimes referred to as "[[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]."&lt;ref name="Chase, Linda 2002"&gt;Meisel and Chase (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  With new technology in cameras and digital equipment, artists are able to be far more precision-oriented and can produce imagery using a wider range of media.  The artist [[William Fink|Bill Fink]] has developed his own technique for creating photorealistic images using soil, pollen, human hair, and cremated human remains.&lt;ref name=advocate&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Photo Realism: Artist Bill Fink uses human ash to create a visual AIDS memorial|author=Steve Greenberg|date=2 June 1992|magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]|issue=604|pages=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photorealism's influence and popularity continues to grow, with new books such as [[Juxtapoz]]'s 2014 book entitled ''Hyperreal'' detailing current trends within the artistic genre.

{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2018}}

'''Propaganda''' is information that is not [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] and is used primarily to [[Social influence|influence]] an audience and further an [[Political agenda|agenda]], often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using [[loaded language]] to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented.&lt;ref name="brit_BLS"&gt;{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Bruce L. | author-link = Bruce Lannes Smith | title = Propaganda | website = Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Inc. | date = 17 February 2016 | url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/propaganda | access-date = 23 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda is often associated with material prepared by governments, but activist groups, companies, religious organizations and the media can also produce propaganda. 

In the twentieth century, the term propaganda has often been associated with a [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] approach, but propaganda historically was a neutral descriptive term.&lt;ref name="brit_BLS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt;

A wide range of materials and media are used for conveying propaganda messages, which changed as new technologies were invented, including paintings, cartoons, posters, pamphlets, films, radio shows, TV shows, and websites. Propaganda is now moving into a digital age utillizing bots, algorithms, to create computational propaganda and [[Propaganda on social media|spread fake or biased news using social media]]. 

In a 1929 literary debate with [[Edward Bernays]], [[Everett Dean Martin]] argues that, "Propaganda is making puppets of us. We are moved by hidden strings which the propagandist manipulates."&lt;ref&gt; [[Everett Dean Martin|Martin, Everett Dean]], Are We Victims of Propaganda, Our Invisible Masters: A Debate with [[Edward Bernays]], The Forum, pp. 142–150, March 1929 (1929)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postflaviana.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/martin-bernays-debate.pdf |title=Martin Bernays debate |website=''postflaviana.org'' |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Propaganda'' is a modern Latin word, the gerundive form of ''propagare'', meaning ''to spread'' or ''to propagate'', thus ''propaganda'' means ''that which is to be propagated''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford dictionary]].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally this word derived from a new administrative body of the [[Catholic]] church ([[Congregation (Roman Curia)|congregation]]) created in 1622, called the ''[[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Congregatio de Propaganda Fide]]'' (''Congregation for Propagating the Faith''), or informally simply ''Propaganda''.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"&gt;Diggs-Brown, Barbara (2011) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0ycySng4YC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48 ''Strategic Public Relations: Audience Focused Practice''] p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=propaganda|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activity was aimed at "propagating" the Catholic faith in non-Catholic countries.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt;

From the 1790s, the term began being used also to refer to ''propaganda'' in secular activities.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt; The term began taking a pejorative or negative connotation in the mid-19th century, when it was used in the political sphere.&lt;ref name="Diggs-Brown2011p48"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|History of propaganda}}

Primitive forms of propaganda have been a human activity as far back as reliable recorded evidence exists. The [[Behistun Inscription]] (c. 515 BC) detailing the rise of [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]] to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] throne is viewed by most historians as an early example of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nagle|first=D. Brendan|title=The Ancient World: Readings in Social and Cultural History|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-69187-6|author2=Stanley M Burstein |page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Another striking example of propaganda during Ancient History is the last Roman civil wars (44-30 BC) during which [[Augustus|Octavian]] and [[Mark Antony]] blame each other for obscure and degrading origins, cruelty, cowardice, oratorical and literary incompetence, debaucheries, luxury, drunkenness and other slanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Borgies|first=Loïc|title=Le conflit propagandiste entre Octavien et Marc Antoine. De l'usage politique de la uituperatio entre 44 et 30 a. C. n.|year=2016|isbn=978-90-429-3459-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This defamation took the form of ''uituperatio'' (Roman rhetorical genre of the invective) which was decisive for shaping the Roman public opinion at this time.

Propaganda during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], helped by the spread of the [[printing press]] throughout Europe, and in particular within Germany, caused new ideas, thoughts, and doctrine to be made available to the public in ways that had never been seen before the 16th century. During the era of the [[American Revolution]], the American colonies had a flourishing network of newspapers and printers who specialized in the topic on behalf of the Patriots (and to a lesser extent on behalf of the Loyalists).&lt;ref&gt;Cole, Richard G, 1975, "The Reformation in Print: German Pamphlets and Propaganda. Archiv für Reformationsgeschichte – Archive for Reformation History", Pg. 93–102&lt;/ref&gt;

The first large-scale and organised propagation of government propaganda was occasioned by the outbreak of [[First World War|war]] in 1914. After the defeat of Germany in the First World War, military officials such as [[Erich Ludendorff]] suggested that British propaganda had been instrumental in their defeat. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to echo this view, believing that it had been a primary cause of the collapse of morale and the revolts in the German home front and Navy in 1918 (see also: [[Dolchstoßlegende]]). In ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' (1925) Hitler expounded his theory of propaganda, which provided a powerful base for his rise to power in 1933. Historian [[Robert Ensor]] explains that "Hitler...puts no limit on what can be done by propaganda; people will believe anything, provided they are told it often enough and emphatically enough, and that contradicters are either silenced or smothered in calumny."&lt;ref&gt; Robert Ensor in David Thomson, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History: volume XII The Era of Violence 1890–1945'' (1st edition 1960), p 84. &lt;/ref&gt; Most propaganda in Nazi Germany was produced by the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]]. [[World War II]] saw continued use of propaganda as a weapon of war, building on the experience of WWI, by Goebbels and the British [[Political Warfare Executive]], as well as the United States [[Office of War Information]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, J. C., 2007, "Film propaganda in Britain and Nazi Germany : World War II cinema.", Oxford:Berg.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the invention of motion pictures gave propaganda-creators a powerful tool for advancing political and military interests when it came to reaching a broad segment of the population and creating consent or encouraging rejection of the real or imagined enemy. In the years following the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, the Soviet government sponsored the Russian film industry with the purpose of making propaganda films (e.g. the 1925 film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'' glorifies [[Communist]] ideals.) In WWII, Nazi filmmakers produced highly emotional films to create popular support for occupying the [[Sudetenland]] and attacking Poland. The 1930s and 1940s, which saw the rise of [[totalitarian]] states and the [[Second World War]], are arguably the "Golden Age of Propaganda". [[Leni Riefenstahl]], a filmmaker working in [[Nazi Germany]], created one of the best-known propaganda movies, ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''. In the US, [[American Animation in World War II|animation]] became popular, especially for winning over youthful audiences and aiding the U.S. war effort, e.g.,''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' (1942), which ridicules [[Hitler]] and advocates the value of freedom. US [[war film]]s in the early 1940s were designed to create a patriotic mindset and [[consensus|convince]] viewers that sacrifices needed to be made to defeat the [[Axis Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip M. Taylor, 1990, "Munitions of the mind: A history of propaganda”, Pg. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Polish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film ''Calling mr. Smith''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lux.org.uk/work/calling-mr-smith1|title=Calling Mr. Smith – LUX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/resource/cAXbMp/rqGRLe9|title=Calling Mr Smith – Centre Pompidou}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1943) about current nazi crimes in occupied Europe and about lies of nazi propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artincinema.com/franciszka-and-stefan-themerson-calling-mr-smith-1943/|title=Franciszka and Stefan Themerson: Calling Mr. Smith (1943) – artincinema|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Western Bloc|West]] and the [[Soviet Union]] both used propaganda extensively during the [[Cold War]]. Both sides used film, television, and radio programming to influence their own citizens, each other, and Third World nations. [[George Orwell]]'s novels ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' are virtual textbooks on the use of propaganda. During the [[Cuban Revolution]], [[Fidel Castro]] stressed the importance of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prudentiapolitica.blogspot.com/2014/05/fidel-propaganda-is-heart-of-our.html|title=Prudentia Politica|author=prudentiapolitica|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Blogspot is not a reliable source.|date=March 2017}} Propaganda was used extensively by Communist forces in the [[Vietnam War]] as means of controlling people's opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/sophana2007vietnamese.pdf] Vietnamese propaganda reflections from 1945 to 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Yugoslav wars]], propaganda was used as a [[military strategy]] by governments of [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and Croatia. Propaganda was used to create fear and hatred, and particularly incite the Serb population against the other ethnicities ([[Bosniaks]], [[Croats]], [[Albanians]] and other non-Serbs). Serb media made a great effort in justifying, revising or denying mass [[war crimes]] committed by Serb forces during these wars.&lt;ref name="Boston University"&gt;{{cite web|date=12 April 1999|title=Serbian Propaganda: A Closer Look|url=http://www.bu.edu/globalbeat/pubs/Pesic041299.html|quote=NOAH ADAMS: The European Center for War, Peace and the News Media, based in London, has received word from Belgrade that no pictures of mass Albanian refugees have been shown at all, and that the Kosovo humanitarian catastrophe is only referred to as the one made up or over-emphasised by Western propaganda.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public perceptions== 
In the early 20th century the term propaganda was used by the founders of the nascent [[public relations]] industry to refer to their people. Literally translated from the [[Latin]] [[gerundive]] as "things that must be disseminated", in some cultures the term is neutral or even positive, while in others the term has acquired a strong negative connotation. The connotations of the term "propaganda" can also vary over time. For example, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and some Spanish language speaking countries, particularly in the [[Southern Cone]], the word "propaganda" usually refers to the most common manipulative media&amp;nbsp;– "advertising".

[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Poster of the 19th-century [[Scandinavism|Scandinavist]] movement]]
In English, ''propaganda'' was originally a neutral term for the dissemination of information in favor of any given cause. During the 20th century, however, the term acquired a thoroughly negative meaning in western countries, representing the intentional dissemination of often false, but certainly "compelling" claims to support or justify political actions or ideologies. According to [[Harold Lasswell]], the term began to fall out of favor due to growing public suspicion of propaganda in the wake of its use during World War I by the [[Committee on Public Information|Creel Committee]] in the United States and the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in Britain: Writing in 1928, Lasswell observed, "In democratic countries the official propaganda bureau was looked upon with genuine alarm, for fear that it might be suborned to party and personal ends. The outcry in the United States against Mr. Creel's famous Bureau of Public Information (or 'Inflammation') helped to din into the public mind the fact that propaganda existed. … The public's discovery of propaganda has led to a great of lamentation over it. Propaganda has become an epithet of contempt and hate, and the propagandists have sought protective coloration in such names as 'public relations council,' 'specialist in public education,' 'public relations adviser.' "&lt;ref&gt;pp. 260–261, "The Function of the Propagandist", ''International Journal of Ethics'', 38 (no. 3): pp. 258–268.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, political science professor Dayton David McKean wrote, "After World War I the word came to be applied to 'what you don’t like of the other fellow’s publicity,' as Edward L. Bernays said...."&lt;ref&gt;p. 113, ''Party and Pressure Politics'', Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is essentially contested and some have argued for a neutral definition&lt;ref&gt;Briant, Emma, L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester:  Manchester University Press p 9 &amp;  Taylor, Phil M. (2002), ‘Debate: Strategic Communications or Democratic Propaganda?’, in Journalism Studies, Vol. 3, No. 3, pp. 437–452.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that ethics depend on intent and context,&lt;ref&gt;Briant, Emma, L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester:  Manchester University Press&lt;/ref&gt; others define it as necessarily unethical and negative.&lt;ref&gt;Doob, L.W. (1949), Public Opinion and Propaganda, London: Cresset Press p 240&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Emma Briant defines it as "the deliberate manipulation of representations (including text, pictures, video, speech etc.) with the intention of producing any effect in the audience (e.g. action or inaction; reinforcement or transformation of feelings, ideas, attitudes or behaviours) that is desired by the propagandist.&lt;ref&gt;Briant, Emma, L (2015) Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: Strategies for Global Change, Manchester:  Manchester University Press p 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Identifying propaganda has always been a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J Schwindt, [https://www.amazon.com/Case-Against-Modern-World-Traditionalist/dp/153282534X The Case Against the Modern World: A Crash Course in Traditionalist Thought], 2016, pp. 202–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The main difficulties have involved differentiating propaganda from other types of [[persuasion]], and avoiding a [[bias]]ed approach. Richard Alan Nelson provides a definition of the term: "Propaganda is neutrally defined as a systematic form of purposeful persuasion that attempts to influence the emotions, attitudes, opinions, and actions of specified target audiences for [[ideology|ideological]], political or commercial purposes through the controlled transmission of one-sided messages (which may or may not be factual) via mass and direct media channels."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Alan Nelson, ''A Chronology and Glossary of Propaganda in the United States'' (1996) pp. 232–233&lt;/ref&gt; The definition focuses on the communicative process involved – or more precisely, on the purpose of the process, and allow "propaganda" to be considered objectively and then interpreted as positive or negative behavior depending on the perspective of the viewer or listener. 
[[File:Propaganda poster in a primary school - DPRK (2604154887).jpg|thumb|Propaganda poster in North Korean primary school]]

According to historian [[Zbyněk Zeman]], propaganda is defined as either white, grey or black. White propaganda openly discloses its source and intent. Grey propaganda has an ambiguous or non-disclosed source or intent. Black propaganda purports to be published by the enemy or some organization besides its actual origins&lt;ref name="new"&gt;{{cite book|title=Selling the War|publisher=Orbis Publishing|first=Zbynek|last=Zeman|date=1978|ISBN=0-85613-312-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (compare with [[black operation]], a type of clandestine operation in which the identity of the sponsoring government is hidden). In scale, these different types of propaganda can also be defined by the potential of true and correct information to compete with the propaganda. For example, opposition to white propaganda is often readily found and may slightly discredit the propaganda source. Opposition to grey propaganda, when revealed (often by an inside source), may create some level of public outcry. Opposition to black propaganda is often unavailable and may be dangerous to reveal, because public cognizance of black propaganda tactics and sources would undermine or backfire the very campaign the black propagandist supported.
&lt;!-- [[File:Edith Cavell propaganda.jpg|thumb|left|The execution of British nurse [[Edith Cavell#Role in World War I propaganda|Edith Cavell]] by the German Army in 1915 was a major theme of [[World War I]] anti-German propaganda.]] --&gt;

[[File:Propaganda Poster in North Korea.jpg|thumb|Propaganda poster in North Korea]]

The propagandist seeks to change the way people understand an issue or situation for the purpose of changing their actions and expectations in ways that are desirable to the interest group. Propaganda, in this sense, serves as a corollary to censorship in which the same purpose is achieved, not by filling people's minds with approved information, but by preventing people from being confronted with opposing points of view. What sets propaganda apart from other forms of advocacy is the willingness of the propagandist to change people's understanding through deception and confusion rather than persuasion and understanding. The leaders of an organization know the information to be one sided or untrue, but this may not be true for the rank and file members who help to disseminate the propaganda.

===Religious===
Propaganda was often used to influence opinions and beliefs on religious issues, particularly during the split between the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Protestantism|Protestant churches]].

More in line with the religious roots of the term, propaganda is also used widely in the debates about [[new religious movement]]s (NRMs), both by people who defend them and by people who oppose them. The latter pejoratively call these NRMs [[cult]]s. [[Anti-cult movement|Anti-cult activists]] and [[Christian countercult movement|Christian countercult activists]] accuse the leaders of what they consider cults of using propaganda extensively to recruit followers and keep them. Some social scientists, such as the late Jeffrey Hadden, and [[CESNUR]] affiliated scholars accuse ex-members of "cults" and the [[anti-cult movement]] of making these unusual religious movements look bad without sufficient reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Religious Movements Page: Conceptualizing "Cult" and "Sect" | url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207042448/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/concult.htm | archivedate=7 February 2006 | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Polish Anti-Cult Movement (Koscianska) – CESNUR | url=http://www.cesnur.org/conferences/riga2000/koscianska.htm | accessdate=4 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wartime===
[[File:AntiJapanesePropagandaTakeDayOff.png|thumb|upright|left|A US Office for War Information poster uses [[stereotype]]d imagery to encourage Americans to work hard to contribute to the war effort]]

Post–World War II usage of the word "propaganda" more typically refers to political or nationalist uses of these techniques or to the promotion of a set of ideas.

Propaganda is a powerful weapon in war; it is used to dehumanize and create hatred toward a supposed enemy, either internal or external, by creating a false image in the mind of soldiers and citizens. This can be done by using derogatory or racist terms (e.g., the racist terms "Jap" and "gook" used during World War II and the [[Vietnam War]], respectively), avoiding some words or language or by making allegations of enemy atrocities. Most propaganda efforts in wartime require the home population to feel the enemy has inflicted an injustice, which may be fictitious or may be based on facts (e.g., the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania]] by the German Navy in World War I). The home population must also believe that the cause of their nation in the war is just. In NATO doctrine, propaganda is defined as "Any information, ideas, doctrines, or special appeals disseminated to influence the opinion, emotions, attitudes, or behaviour of any specified group in order to benefit the sponsor either directly or indirectly."&lt;ref&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency Aap-6 –  Glossary of terms and definitions, p 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this perspective, information provided does not need to be necessarily false, but must be instead relevant to specific goals of the "actor" or "system" that performs it.

Propaganda is also one of the methods used in [[psychological warfare]], which may also involve [[false flag]] operations in which the identity of the operatives is depicted as those of an enemy nation (e.g., The [[Bay of Pigs]] invasion used CIA planes painted in Cuban Air Force markings). The term propaganda may also refer to false information meant to reinforce the mindsets of people who already believe as the propagandist wishes (e.g., During the First World War, the main purpose of British propaganda was to encourage men join the army, and women to work in the country's industry. The propaganda posters were used, because radios and TVs were not very common at that time.).&lt;ref&gt;Callanan, James D. The Evolution of The CIA's Covert Action Mission, 1947–1963. Durham University. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption is that, if people believe something false, they will constantly be assailed by doubts. Since these doubts are unpleasant (see [[cognitive dissonance]]), people will be eager to have them extinguished, and are therefore receptive to the reassurances of those in power. For this reason propaganda is often addressed to people who are already sympathetic to the agenda or views being presented. This process of reinforcement uses an individual's predisposition to self-select "agreeable" information sources as a mechanism for maintaining control over populations.

[[File:Britannialion.jpg|thumb|[[Britannia (emblem)|Britannia]] arm-in-arm with [[Uncle Sam]] symbolizes the British-American alliance in World War I.]]

Propaganda may be administered in insidious ways. For instance, disparaging [[disinformation]] about the history of certain groups or foreign countries may be encouraged or tolerated in the educational system. Since few people actually double-check what they learn at school, such disinformation will be repeated by journalists as well as parents, thus reinforcing the idea that the disinformation item is really a "well-known fact", even though no one repeating the myth is able to point to an authoritative source. The disinformation is then recycled in the media and in the educational system, without the need for direct governmental intervention on the media. Such permeating propaganda may be used for political goals: by giving citizens a false impression of the quality or policies of their country, they may be incited to reject certain proposals or certain remarks or ignore the experience of others.

In the Soviet Union during the Second World War, the propaganda designed to encourage civilians was controlled by Stalin, who insisted on a heavy-handed style that educated audiences easily saw was inauthentic. On the other hand, the unofficial rumours about German atrocities were well founded and convincing.&lt;ref&gt;Karel C. Berkhoff, ''Motherland in Danger: Soviet Propaganda during World War II'' (2012) [https://www.amazon.com/Motherland-Danger-Soviet-Propaganda-during/dp/0674049241/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin was a Georgian who spoke Russian with a heavy accent. That would not do for a national hero so starting in the 1930s all new visual portraits of Stalin were retouched to erase his Georgian facial characteristics and make him a more generalized Soviet hero. Only his eyes and famous mustache remained unaltered. Zhores Medvedev and Roy Medvedev say his "majestic new image was devised appropriately to depict the leader of all times and of all peoples."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zhores A. Medvedev and |title=The Unknown Stalin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v3BrNF80AzUC&amp;pg=PA248|year=2003|page=248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 20 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] prohibits any propaganda for war as well as any advocacy of national or religious hatred that constitutes [[incitement]] to discrimination, hostility or violence by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights|url=http://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx|website=United Nations Human Rights: Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.|[[Hermann Göring]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustave Gilbert]]'s ''Nuremberg Diary''(1947). In an interview with Gilbert in Göring's jail cell during the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials (18 April 1946)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Advertising===
Propaganda shares techniques with advertising and [[public relations]], each of which can be thought of as propaganda that promotes a commercial product or shapes the perception of an organization, person, or brand.

Journalistic theory generally holds that news items should be objective, giving the reader an accurate background and analysis of the subject at hand. On the other hand, advertisements evolved from the traditional commercial advertisements to include also a new type in the form of paid articles or broadcasts disguised as news. These generally present an issue in a very subjective and often misleading light, primarily meant to persuade rather than inform. Normally they use only subtle [[propaganda techniques]] and not the more obvious ones used in traditional commercial advertisements. If the reader believes that a paid advertisement is in fact a news item, the message the advertiser is trying to communicate will be more easily "believed" or "internalized". Such advertisements are considered obvious examples of "covert" propaganda because they take on the appearance of objective information rather than the appearance of propaganda, which is misleading. Federal law specifically mandates that any advertisement appearing in the format of a news item must state that the item is in fact a paid advertisement.

===Politics===
Propaganda has become more common in political contexts, in particular to refer to certain efforts sponsored by governments, political groups, but also often covert interests. In the early 20th century, propaganda was exemplified in the form of party slogans. Propaganda also has much in common with [[public information]] campaigns by governments, which are intended to encourage or discourage certain forms of behavior (such as wearing seat belts, not smoking, not littering and so forth). Again, the emphasis is more political in propaganda. Propaganda can take the form of [[leaflet (information)|leaflets]], posters, TV and radio broadcasts and can also extend to any other [[Mass media|medium]]. In the case of the United States, there is also an important legal (imposed by law) distinction between advertising (a type of '''overt propaganda''') and what the Government Accountability Office (GAO), an arm of the United States Congress, refers to as "covert propaganda".

Roderick Hindery argues&lt;ref&gt;Hindery, Roderick R., Indoctrination and Self-deception or Free and Critical Thought? (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; that propaganda exists on the political left, and right, and in mainstream centrist parties. Hindery further argues that debates about most social issues can be productively revisited in the context of asking "what is or is not propaganda?" Not to be overlooked is the link between propaganda, indoctrination, and terrorism/counterterrorism. He argues that threats to destroy are often as socially disruptive as physical devastation itself.

Since [[9/11]] and the appearance of greater media fluidity, propaganda institutions, practices and legal frameworks have been evolving in the US and Britain. [[Dr Emma Louise Briant]] shows how this included expansion and integration of the apparatus cross-government and details attempts to coordinate the forms of propaganda for foreign and domestic audiences, with new efforts in [[strategic communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briant|title=Allies and Audiences Evolving Strategies in Defense and Intelligence Propaganda|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=April 2015|volume=20|issue=2|pages=145–165|url=http://hij.sagepub.com/content/20/2/145.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were subject to contestation within the [[US Government]], resisted by [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] [[Public affairs (military)|Public Affairs]] and critiqued by some scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Briant|first1=Emma|title=Propaganda and Counter-terrorism: strategies for global change|date=2015|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (section 1078 (a)) amended the US Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (popularly referred to as the [[Smith-Mundt Act]]) and the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 1987, allowing for materials produced by the State Department and the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) to be released within U.S. borders for the Archivist of the United States. The Smith-Mundt Act, as amended, provided that "the Secretary and the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall make available to the Archivist of the United States, for domestic distribution, motion pictures, films, videotapes, and other material 12 years after the initial dissemination of the material abroad (...) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Department of State or the Broadcasting Board of Governors from engaging in any medium or form of communication, either directly or indirectly, because a United States domestic audience is or may be thereby exposed to program material, or based on a presumption of such exposure." Public concerns were raised upon passage due to the relaxation of prohibitions of domestic propaganda in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smith-Mundt Act|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130715/11210223804/anti-propaganda-ban-repealed-freeing-state-dept-to-direct-its-broadcasting-arm-american-citizens.shtml|website='Anti-Propaganda' Ban Repealed, Freeing State Dept.

==Techniques==
{{details|Propaganda techniques}}

[[File:Anti-capitalism color.gif|right|upright|thumb|[[Anti-Capitalism|Anti-capitalist]] propaganda]]

Common media for transmitting propaganda messages include news reports, government reports, historical revision, [[junk science]], books, leaflets, [[propaganda film|movies]], radio, television, and posters. Some propaganda campaigns follow a strategic transmission pattern to [[indoctrinate]] the target group. This may begin with a simple transmission, such as a leaflet or advertisement dropped from a plane or an advertisement. Generally these messages will contain directions on how to obtain more information, via a web site, hot line, radio program, etc. (as it is seen also for selling purposes among other goals). The strategy intends to initiate the individual from information recipient to information seeker through reinforcement, and then from information seeker to [[opinion leader]] through indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;Garth S. Jowett and Victoria J.: O'Donnell, ''Propaganda &amp; Persuasion'' (5th ed. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of techniques based in [[social psychology|social psychological]] research are used to generate propaganda. Many of these same techniques can be found under [[Fallacy|logical fallacies]], since propagandists use arguments that, while sometimes convincing, are not necessarily valid.

Some time has been spent analyzing the means by which the propaganda messages are transmitted. That work is important but it is clear that information dissemination strategies become propaganda strategies only when coupled with ''propagandistic messages''. Identifying these messages is a necessary prerequisite to study the methods by which those messages are spread. &lt;!-- Commented out: Below are a number of techniques for generating propaganda: [[File:Destroy the old world Cultural Revolution poster.png|right|thumb|Chinese propaganda to urge people to "destroy the old world, forge the new world," referring to the cultural aspects acceptable and unacceptable by the country's [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], 1966.]] --&gt;

==Models==

===Social psychology===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, "Stürmerkasten".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic newspaper ''[[Der Stürmer]]'', [[Worms]], Germany, 1935]]
The field of [[social psychology]] includes the study of [[persuasion]]. Social psychologists can be [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociologists]] or [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychologists]]. The field includes many theories and approaches to understanding persuasion. For example, communication theory points out that people can be persuaded by the communicator's credibility, expertise, trustworthiness, and attractiveness. The elaboration likelihood model as well as heuristic models of persuasion suggest that a number of factors (e.g., the degree of interest of the recipient of the communication), influence the degree to which people allow superficial factors to persuade them. Nobel Prize–winning psychologist [[Herbert A. Simon]] won the Nobel prize for his theory that people are [[cognitive miser]]s. That is, in a society of mass information, people are forced to make decisions quickly and often superficially, as opposed to logically.

According to [[William W. Biddle]]'s 1931 article "A psychological definition of propaganda", "[t]he four principles followed in propaganda are: (1) rely on emotions, never argue; (2) cast propaganda into the pattern of "we" versus an "enemy"; (3) reach groups as well as individuals; (4) hide the propagandist as much as possible."&lt;ref&gt;Biddle, William W. [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1932-03618-001 A psychological definition of propaganda]. [[The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]], Vol 26(3), Oct 1931, 283–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herman and Chomsky===
[[File:Come unto me, ye opprest.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Early 20th-century depiction of a "European [[Anarchism|Anarchist]]" attempting to destroy the [[Statue of Liberty]]]]

The [[propaganda model]] is a theory advanced by [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] which argues [[systemic bias]]es in the mass media and seeks to explain them in terms of structural economic [[cause]]s:

{{quote|The 20th century has been characterized by three developments of great political importance: the growth of democracy, the growth of [[corporate power]], and the growth of corporate propaganda as a means of protecting corporate power against democracy.&lt;ref&gt;"Letter from Noam Chomsky" to ''Covert Action Quarterly,'' quoting [[Alex Carey (writer)|Alex Carey]], Australian social scientist, {{cite web |url=http://mediafilter.org/caq/CAQ54chmky.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710125156/http://mediafilter.org/caq/CAQ54chmky.html |archivedate=10 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/25/006.html|title=Review of Alex Carey, Taking the Risk out of Democracy: Propaganda in the US and Australia|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

First presented in their 1988 book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', the [[propaganda model]] views the private media as businesses selling a product&amp;nbsp;– readers and [[audiences]] (rather than news)&amp;nbsp;– to other businesses (advertisers) and relying primarily on government and corporate information and propaganda. The theory postulates five general classes of "filters" that determine the type of news that is presented in news media: [[Ownership]] of the medium, the medium's Funding, Sourcing of the news, [[Propaganda model#Flak|Flak]], and [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] ideology.

The first three (ownership, funding, and sourcing) are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important. Although the model was based mainly on the characterization of United States media, Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic economic structure and organizing principles the [[model (abstract)|model]] postulates as the cause of [[media bias]].

==Children==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2009}}
[[File:Propaganda do Estado Novo (Brasil).jpg|thumb|upright|A 1938 propaganda of the [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|New State]] depicting Brazilian President [[Getúlio Vargas]] flanked by children. The text on the bottom right of this poster translates as: "Children! Learning, at home and in school, the cult of the Fatherland, you will bring all chances of success to life. Only love builds and, strongly loving Brazil, you will lead it to the greatest of destinies among Nations, fulfilling the desires of exaltation nestled in every Brazilian heart."]]
[[File:Los Carlitos pag 73.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.75|Poster promoting the Nicaraguan [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]]. The text reads: "Sandinista children: Toño, Delia and Rodolfo are in the Association of Sandinista Children. Sandinista children use a [[neckerchief]]. They participate in the revolution and are very studious."]]
Of all the potential targets for propaganda, children are the most vulnerable because they are the least prepared with the critical reasoning and contextual comprehension they need to determine whether a message is propaganda or not. The attention children give their environment during development, due to the process of developing their understanding of the world, causes them to absorb propaganda indiscriminately. Also, children are highly imitative: studies by [[Albert Bandura]], [[Dorothea Ross]] and [[Sheila A. Ross]] in the 1960s indicated that, to a degree, [[socialization]], formal education and standardized television programming can be seen as using propaganda for the purpose of [[indoctrination]]. The use of propaganda in schools was highly prevalent during the 1930s and 1940s in Germany, as well as in [[Stalinist]] Russia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} 
[[John Taylor Gatto]] asserts that modern schooling in the USA is designed to "dumb us down" in order to turn children into material suitable to work in factories. This ties into the Herman &amp; Chomsky thesis of rise of Corporate Power, and its use in creating educational systems which serve its purposes against those of democracy.

===Anti-Semitic propaganda for children===
In [[Nazi]] Germany, the education system was thoroughly co-opted to indoctrinate the German youth with [[anti-Semitic]] ideology. This was accomplished through the [[National Socialist Teachers League]], of which 97% of all German teachers were members in 1937. The League encouraged the teaching of racial theory. Picture books for children such as ''Don't Trust A Fox in A Green Meadow or The Word of A Jew'', ''[[Der Giftpilz]]'' (translated into English as ''The Poisonous Mushroom'') and ''The Poodle-Pug-Dachshund-Pincher'' were widely circulated (over 100,000 copies of ''Don't Trust A Fox''...&amp;nbsp;were circulated during the late 1930s) and contained depictions of Jews as devils, child molesters and other morally charged figures. Slogans such as "Judas the Jew betrayed Jesus the German to the Jews" were recited in class.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Mary. "Propaganda and Children During the Hitler Years". Jewish Virtual Library. https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/propchil.html&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an example of a propagandistic math problem recommended by the National Socialist Essence of Education: "The Jews are aliens in Germany—in 1933 there were 66,606,000 inhabitants in the German Reich, of whom 499,682 (.75%) were Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Hirsch, Herbert. ''Genocide and the Politics of Memory''. Chapel Hill &amp; London: University of North Carolina Press, 1995. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ramkinar Baij''''' is a book by [[R. Siva Kumar]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/48693&lt;/ref&gt; that was brought out on the occasion of a massive retrospective exhibition of [[Ram Kinker Baij]] at the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]].

The exhibition was curated by K.S. Radhakrishnan&lt;ref&gt;http://isikkim.com/2012-02-a-retrospective-of-ramkinkar-baij-inaugurated-in-delhi-09-5/&lt;/ref&gt; and the book was brought out in collaboration with the Delhi Art Gallery. The book presents entire body of Ramkinkar’s sketches, watercolours, etchings, oils and sculptures, together with many invaluable period photographs. This is considered to be the authoritative volume on the “prolific master”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120323/jsp/opinion/story_15278556.jsp#.VJDGSSvF-So&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing distinction between [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] and [[Ram Kinker Baij]] Siva Kumar notes, "If his friend and colleague Binodebihari painted the starker side of Santiniketan landscape, and saw himself as a lonely palm tree in the middle of the barren and parched Khoai, Ramkinkar saw himself as the Palash in full bloom: No leaves, bare branches, fully ablaze".&lt;ref&gt;http://muktodhara.org/?p=2169&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 [[R. Siva Kumar]] was awarded by the [[Paschimbanga Bangla Akademi]] for this book.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2062">Roger de Piles's '''''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres...avec un traité du peintre parfait''''' ( ''The Art of Painting and the Lives of the Painters''), was a major art biography of painters. It was written by the French spy [[Roger de Piles]]. In 1692, during the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], he was arrested in the Hague carrying a false passport and imprisoned for the next five years, where he wote his ''L'Abrégé'' in 7 parts; 1) Sketch of the perfect painter, 2) Greek painters; 3) Painters from Rome &amp; Florence; 4) Painters from Venice; 5) Painters from [[Lombardy]]; 6) Painters from Germany and the Low Countries; 7) Painters from France and ending with his famous "Balance of painters". The book was finally published in 1699 following his appointment as Conseiller Honoraire to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] in Paris.

'''Sheldon Lee Gosline'' is an [[United States|American]] [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] who has extensively studied the ancient civilizations of the Far East. He is noted for proposing the existence of a developing literate civilization in southern China dating to the second millennium BCE.

==Biography==
Sheldon Lee Gosline began his professional education at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he received a B.A. degrees in Oriental Studies and Art History in 1985. He later continued his studies at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he received a B.A. degree 1988 and was awarded an M.A. degree in Oriental Studies in 1993.
He interrupted his stay at Cambridge to study at the [[University of Chicago]], receiving an M.A. degree in Egyptology and Near Eastern Archaeology in 1992.
After Cambridge he studied at [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]]. He received his Ph.D. in 2013 from [[University College London]], where he researched at the [[Wellcome Trust]] Centre for the History of Medicine and the [[UCL Centre for the History of Medicine]]. His thesis concerned the intersection of business and medicine.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYC&gt;[https://www.explorers.org/events/detail/nyc_public_lecture_series_feat_sheldon_gosline ''The Explorers Club''], NYC Public Lecture Series Featuring Sheldon Gosline (8 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gosline is owner of Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts based in Warren Center, PA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shangri-La Publications Art Design and Shangrila Gifts|url=http://shangri-la.0catch.com/|publisher=Shangri-La|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=www.shangri-la.0catch.com|url=http://www.roadurls.com/www.shangri-la.0catch.com|website=Road Url|publisher=Road Url|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline has taught at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China; and at UW-Madison. He was at Northeast Normal University through 2004.&lt;ref name=CV/&gt; 
In 2011, he moved to London to pursue a Ph.D. in the history of medicine, at [[University College London]]. Once he completed the degree, he returned to China to research the writing of the country’s minority groups.  He was first a visiting professor at [[Minzu University of China]] and [[Tsinghua University]], both in Beijing.  Since 2015, he has taught medical humanities at [[Peking University]]. He is a member of several professional associations.

He states that he has become proficient in or conversant with nine contemporary or ancient languages.&lt;ref name=CV&gt;[http://shangri-la.0catch.com/press/vitae.html] ''Vitae of Prof. Sheldon Lee Gosline'' (shangri-la website; accessed 21 April 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lost civilization theory==
IN 2013 Gosline was shown some inscriptions found in [[Guangxi]] province and considered that several were based on the [[Indus script]] and Persian cuneiform. On a field trip to the area where they were found in 2014 he discovered what he considered evidence of further inscriptions made up of large rocks regularly spaced and what he called “a man-made platform of megalithic construction" and something that “appeared to be a carved chair or throne.”   Sitting on it he “sensed a harmony and that I was in the midst of an ancient time calculating device".&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt; He returned to what he called an "observatory complex" with caver including royal burials in June 2014 with a group of researchers who examined the site and stated that “We confirmed most of the things I’d found as potential alignments, and we confirmed that there was artifact evidence in the area that showed human occupation.” He reported this in a talk to the New York Explorers Club later that year, saying that he believed he had found an unknown civilization. 

Reports from Chinese researchers who accompanied him were less positive. Dr. Ye Xiaohong reported that "Two suspected cave tombs are not man-made," "No artificial traces were found on the huge stone in the suspected artificial remains, neither the suspected structures for observation nor the suspected ancient topographic maps" and that what Gosline had interpreted as ancient writing on some rocks "were certainly produced by natural force".&lt;ref name="Ye"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ye|first1=Xiaohong|title=Preliminary Observation and Cognition at Gansang|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0714/46829.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese researchers also surveyed the alignments that Gosline thought related to the chair (which they agreed was a natural water-created formation) and concluded that the stone could not have been used as part of an observatory. &lt;ref name="Xu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xu|first1=Fengxian|title=A Survey of Gansang site and Further Discussion|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46710.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Chinese researcher who was part of Gosline's group stated that "Gosline proclaimed that he had found several megalithic sites including observatories, palaces, and ancient cave tombs，petro-glyphs and even plan maps at Gansang, Nadou, and Bupeng in Pingguo county, Guangxi".  The conclusion was that "We have not found any artificial remains, artifacts, and occupation layer both at Nadou and Bupeng sites" and that most of the "scratches, the petro-glyphs and plan maps on the rocks called by Gosline, are natural" with a few that might be artificial and needed microscopic examination. However they did believe that the "Gansang site might have worked as an important settlement in Youjiang River Reach." Commenting on the engraved stones reported by Gosline, they commented that they seemed too new, that they were too intact with "the whole texts just fit to the sizes of the planks", that they lacked an archaeological context and that there were too few repetitions of characters.&lt;ref name="Nu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nu|first1=He|title=Thinking about the Sites in Pingguo county, S China|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/Forum/2014/0702/46706.html|website=Chinese Archaeology|publisher=Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=15 January 2017|date=2014-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gosline’s observation that the newly discovered inscriptions seemed to include Persian cuneiform is unproven as of 2016.&lt;ref name=NYC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/did-a-coded-message-lead-an-american-to-a-lost-civilization-in-china?ct=t(Newsletter_4_21_20164_20_2016)&amp;mc_cid=5e86c4b93a&amp;mc_eid=34be11d5e3] Did A Coded Message Lead an American to a Lost Civilization in

'''Single-photon emission computed tomography''' ('''SPECT''', or less commonly, '''SPET''') is a [[nuclear medicine]] [[tomography|tomographic]] imaging technique using [[gamma ray]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|SPECT}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is very similar to conventional nuclear medicine planar imaging using a [[gamma camera]] (that is, [[scintigraphy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A CdTe detector for hyperspectral SPECT imaging|publisher=IOP Journal of Instrumentation | doi=10.1088/1748-0221/7/08/P08027 | volume=7|journal=Journal of Instrumentation|page=P08027|year=2012|author=Scuffham J W}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is able to provide [[true 3D]] information. This information is typically presented as cross-sectional slices through the patient, but can be freely reformatted or manipulated as required.

The technique requires delivery of a gamma-emitting [[radioisotope]] (a [[radionuclide]]) into the patient, normally through injection into the bloodstream. On occasion, the radioisotope is a simple soluble dissolved ion, such as an  [[Isotopes of gallium|isotope of gallium]](III). Most of the time, though, a marker radioisotope is attached to a specific ligand to create a [[radioligand]], whose properties bind it to certain types of tissues. This marriage allows the combination of ligand and [[radiopharmaceutical]] to be carried and bound to a place of interest in the body, where the ligand concentration is seen by a gamma camera.

==Principles==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:TEMP-Siemens.jpg|thumb|A Siemens brand SPECT scanner, consisting of two gamma cameras.]]
Instead of just "taking a picture of anatomical structures", a SPECT scan monitors level of biological activity at each place in the 3-D region analyzed. Emissions from the radionuclide indicate amounts of blood flow in the capillaries of the imaged regions.  In the same way that a plain [[Radiography|X-ray]] is a 2-dimensional (2-D) view of a 3-dimensional structure, the image obtained by a [[gamma camera]] is a 2-D view of 3-D distribution of a [[radionuclide]].

SPECT imaging is performed by using a gamma camera to acquire multiple 2-D images (also called [[graphical projection|projections]]), from multiple angles. A computer is then used to apply a [[tomographic reconstruction]] algorithm to the multiple projections, yielding a 3-D data set. This data set may then be manipulated to show thin slices along any chosen axis of the body, similar to those obtained from other tomographic techniques, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), [[X-ray computed tomography]] (X-ray CT), and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET).

SPECT is similar to PET in its use of radioactive tracer material and detection of gamma rays. In contrast with PET, the tracers used in SPECT emit gamma radiation that is measured directly, whereas PET tracers emit positrons that annihilate with electrons up to a few millimeters away, causing two gamma photons to be emitted in opposite directions. A PET scanner detects these emissions "coincident" in time, which provides more radiation event localization information and, thus, higher spatial resolution images than SPECT (which has about 1&amp;nbsp;cm resolution). SPECT scans are significantly less expensive than PET scans, in part because they are able to use longer-lived and more easily obtained radioisotopes than PET.

Because SPECT acquisition is very similar to planar gamma camera imaging, the same [[Radiopharmacology|radiopharmaceuticals]] may be used. If a patient is examined in another type of nuclear medicine scan, but the images are non-diagnostic, it may be possible to proceed straight to SPECT by moving the patient to a SPECT instrument, or even by simply reconfiguring the camera for SPECT image acquisition while the patient remains on the table.

[[File:SPECT CT.JPG|thumb|left|SPECT machine performing a total body bone scan. The patient lies on a table that slides through the machine, while a pair of gamma cameras rotate around her.]]
To acquire SPECT images, the gamma camera is rotated around the patient. Projections are acquired at defined points during the rotation, typically every 3–6 degrees. In most cases, a full 360-degree rotation is used to obtain an optimal reconstruction. The time taken to obtain each projection is also variable, but 15–20 seconds is typical. This gives a total scan time of 15–20 minutes.

Multi-headed gamma cameras can accelerate acquisition. For example, a dual-headed camera can be used with heads spaced 180 degrees apart, allowing two projections to be acquired simultaneously, with each head requiring 180 degrees of rotation. Triple-head cameras with 120-degree spacing are also used.

Cardiac [[gated acquisition (medical imaging)|gated acquisitions]] are possible with SPECT, just as with planar imaging techniques such as [[Radionuclide angiography|multi gated acquisition scan]] (MUGA). Triggered by [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiogram]] (EKG) to obtain differential information about the heart in various parts of its cycle, gated myocardial SPECT can be used to obtain quantitative information about myocardial perfusion, thickness, and contractility of the myocardium during various parts of the cardiac cycle, and also to allow calculation of [[Ejection fraction|left ventricular ejection fraction]], stroke volume, and cardiac output.

==Application==
SPECT can be used to complement any gamma imaging study, where a true 3D representation can be helpful, such as tumor imaging, infection ([[leukocyte]]) imaging, thyroid imaging or [[bone scintigraphy]].

Because SPECT permits accurate localisation in 3D space, it can be used to provide information about localised function in internal organs, such as functional cardiac or brain imaging.

===Myocardial perfusion imaging===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{main article|Myocardial perfusion imaging}}
Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a form of functional cardiac imaging, used for the diagnosis of [[ischemic heart disease]]. The underlying principle is that under conditions of stress, diseased [[myocardium]] receives less blood flow than normal myocardium. MPI is one of several types of [[cardiac stress test]].

A cardiac specific radiopharmaceutical is administered, e.g., &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-[[tetrofosmin]] (Myoview, GE healthcare), &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-sestamibi (Cardiolite, Bristol-Myers Squibb) or [[Thallium-201]] chloride. Following this, the heart rate is raised to induce myocardial stress, either by exercise on a [[Treadmill#Exercise treadmills|treadmill]] or pharmacologically with [[adenosine]], [[dobutamine]], or [[dipyridamole]] ([[aminophylline]] can be used to reverse the effects of dipyridamole).

SPECT imaging performed after stress reveals the distribution of the radiopharmaceutical, and therefore the relative blood flow to the different regions of the myocardium. Diagnosis is made by comparing stress images to a further set of images obtained at rest which are normally acquired prior to the stress images.

MPI has been demonstrated to have an overall accuracy of about 83% ([[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]]: 85%; [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]]: 72%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12468513|year=2002|last1=Elhendy|first1=A|last2=Bax|first2=JJ|last3=Poldermans|first3=D|title=Dobutamine stress myocardial perfusion imaging in coronary artery disease.|volume=43|issue=12|pages=1634–46|journal=Journal of Nuclear Medicine|url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/43/12/1634.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is comparable with (or better than) other non-invasive tests for ischemic heart disease.

===Functional brain imaging===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{main article|Neuroimaging}}
Usually, the gamma-emitting tracer used in functional brain imaging is [[Technetium (99mTc) exametazime|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO]] (hexamethylpropylene amine oxime). [[Technetium-99m|&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc]] is a metastable [[nuclear isomer]] that emits gamma rays that can be detected by a gamma camera. Attaching it to HMPAO allows &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc to be taken up by brain tissue in a manner proportional to brain blood flow, in turn allowing [[cerebral blood flow]] to be assessed with the nuclear gamma camera.

Because blood flow in the brain is tightly coupled to local brain metabolism and energy use, the &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO tracer (as well as the similar &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-EC tracer) is used to assess brain metabolism regionally, in an attempt to diagnose and differentiate the different causal pathologies of [[dementia]]. Meta-analysis of many reported studies suggests that SPECT with this tracer is about 74% sensitive at diagnosing Alzheimer's disease vs. 81% sensitivity for clinical exam ([[cognitive test]]ing, etc.). More recent studies have shown the accuracy of SPECT in Alzheimer's diagnosis may be as high as 88%.&lt;ref name="pmid16785801"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bonte FJ, Harris TS, Hynan LS, Bigio EH, White CL |title=Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT in the differential diagnosis of the dementias with histopathologic confirmation |journal=Clin Nucl Med |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=376–8 |year=2006|pmid=16785801 |doi=10.1097/01.rlu.0000222736.81365.63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In meta analysis, SPECT was superior to clinical exam and clinical criteria (91% vs. 70%) in being able to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from vascular dementias.&lt;ref name="pmid15545324"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dougall NJ, Bruggink S, Ebmeier KP |title=Systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT in dementia |journal=Am J Geriatr Psychiatry |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=554–70 |year=2004 |pmid=15545324 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajgp.12.6.554}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter ability relates to SPECT's imaging of local metabolism of the brain, in which the patchy loss of cortical metabolism seen in multiple strokes differs clearly from the more even or "smooth" loss of non-occipital cortical brain function typical of Alzheimer's disease. Another recent review article showed that multi-headed SPECT cameras with quantitative analysis result in an overall sensitivity of 84-89% and an overall specificity of 83-89% in cross sectional studies and sensitivity of 82-96% and specificity of 83-89% for longitudinal studies of dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henderson|first=Theodore|title=The diagnosis and evaluation of dementia and mild cognitive impairment with emphasis on SPECT perfusion neuroimaging|journal=CNS Spectrums|date=December 2012|volume=17|issue=4|pages=188–89|doi=10.1017/S1092852912000636|pmid=22929226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc-HMPAO SPECT scanning competes with [[fludeoxyglucose]] (FDG) [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scanning of the brain, which works to assess regional brain glucose metabolism, to provide very similar information about local brain damage from many processes. SPECT is more widely available, because the radioisotope used  is longer-lasting and far less expensive in SPECT, and the gamma scanning equipment is less expensive as well. While &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is extracted from relatively simple [[technetium-99m generator]]s, which are delivered to hospitals and scanning centers weekly to supply fresh radioisotope, FDG PET relies on FDG, which is made in an expensive medical [[cyclotron]] and "hot-lab" (automated chemistry lab for radiopharmaceutical manufacture), and then   delivered immediately to scanning sites because of the natural short 110-minute half-life of [[Fluorine-18]].

===Applications in nuclear technology===
In the nuclear power sector, the SPECT technique can be applied to image radioisotope distributions in irradiated nuclear fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:164459/FULLTEXT01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the irradiation of nuclear fuel (e.g. uranium) with neutrons in a nuclear reactor, a wide array of gamma-emitting radionuclides are naturally produced in the fuel, such as fission products ([[cesium-137]], [[barium-140]] and [[europium-154]]) and activation products ([[chromium-51]] and [[cobalt-58]]). These may be imaged using SPECT in order to verify the presence of fuel rods in a stored fuel assembly for [[IAEA safeguards]] purposes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/25/037/25037535.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to validate predictions of core simulation codes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.13182/NT05-A3632 | volume=151 | title=Nondestructive Experimental Determination of the Pin-Power Distribution in Nuclear Fuel Assemblies | year=2005 | journal=Nuclear Technology | pages=70–76 | author=Jacobsson Svärd Staffan, Håkansson Ane, Bäcklin Anders, Osifo Otasowie, Willman Christopher, Jansson Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to study the behavior of the nuclear fuel in normal operation,

==Reconstruction==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Coded aperture mask (for gamma camera).jpg|thumb|[[Coded aperture]] mask for [[gamma camera]]]]
Reconstructed images typically have resolutions of 64&amp;times;64 or 128&amp;times;128 pixels, with the pixel sizes ranging from 3–6&amp;nbsp;mm. The number of projections acquired is chosen to be approximately equal to the width of the resulting images. In general, the resulting reconstructed images will be of lower resolution, have increased noise than planar images, and be susceptible to [[Artifact (observational)|artifacts]].

Scanning is time consuming, and it is essential that there is no patient movement during the scan time. Movement can cause significant degradation of the reconstructed images, although movement compensation reconstruction techniques can help with this. A highly uneven distribution of radiopharmaceutical also has the potential to cause artifacts. A very intense area of activity (e.g., the bladder) can cause extensive streaking of the images and obscure neighboring areas of activity. This is a limitation of the [[filtered back projection]] reconstruction algorithm. [[Iterative reconstruction]] is an alternative algorithm that is growing in importance, as it is less sensitive to artifacts and can also correct for attenuation and depth dependent blurring. Furthermore, iterative algorithms can be made more efficacious using the [[Superiorization]] methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.3934/ipi.2014.8.223 | year=2014| volume=8 | vauthors = Luo,S, Zhou,T|title=Superiorization of EM algorithm and its application in single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) | journal=Inverse Problems and Imaging | pages=88–97| arxiv=1209.6116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attenuation of the gamma rays within the patient can lead to significant underestimation of activity in deep tissues, compared to superficial tissues. Approximate correction is possible, based on relative position of the activity, and optimal correction is obtained with measured attenuation values. Modern SPECT equipment is available with an integrated X-ray CT scanner. As X-ray CT images are an attenuation map of the tissues, this data can be incorporated into the SPECT reconstruction to correct for attenuation. It also provides a precisely [[Image registration|registered]] CT image, which can provide additional anatomical information.

Scatter of the gamma rays as well as the random nature of gamma rays can also lead to the degradation of quality of SPECT images and cause loss of resolution. Scatter correction and resolution recovery are also applied to improve resolution of SPECT images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3134425_Three-dimensional_restoration_of_single_photon_emission_computed_tomography_images|title= D.

==SPECT/CT==
In some cases a SPECT gamma scanner may be built to operate with a [[x-ray computed tomography|conventional CT scanner]], with coregistration of images. As in [[PET-CT|PET/CT]], this allows location of tumors or tissues which may be seen on SPECT scintigraphy, but are difficult to locate precisely with regard to other anatomical structures. Such scans are most useful for tissues outside the brain, where location of tissues may be far more variable. For example, SPECT/CT may be used in [[sestamibi parathyroid scan]] applications, where the technique is useful in locating ectopic parathyroid adenomas which may not be in their usual locations in the thyroid gland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18997051 | doi=10.2967/jnumed.108.054858 | volume=49 | title=Preoperative 123I/99mTc-sestamibi subtraction SPECT and SPECT/CT in primary hyperparathyroidism | author=Neumann DR, Obuchowski NA, Difilippo FP | journal=J Nucl Med | pages=2012–7 | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expert needed|computer science|date=July 2009}}

In [[computer science]], '''soft computing''' (sometimes referred to as [[computational intelligence]], though CI does not have an agreed definition) is the use of inexact solutions to computationally hard tasks such as the solution of [[NP-complete]] problems, for which there is no known algorithm that can compute an exact solution in [[polynomial time]]. Soft computing differs from conventional (hard) computing in that, unlike hard computing, it is tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and [[approximation]]. In effect, the role model for soft computing is the [[human]] [[mind]].

The principal constituents of Soft Computing (SC) are [[Fuzzy logic|Fuzzy Logic]] (FL), [[Evolutionary computation|Evolutionary Computation]] (EC), [[Machine learning|Machine Learning]] (ML) and [[Probabilistic logic|Probabilistic Reasoning]] (PR), with the latter subsuming [[Bayesian network|belief networks]] and parts of learning theory.

==Introduction==
Soft Computing became a formal area of study in Computer Science in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Zadeh, Lotfi A., "Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Soft Computing,"  Communications of the ACM, March 1994, Vol. 37 No. 3, pages 77-84.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier computational approaches could model and precisely analyze only relatively simple systems. More complex systems arising in [[biology]], [[medicine]], the [[humanities]], [[management science]]s, and similar fields often remained intractable to conventional mathematical and analytical methods.  However, it should be pointed out that complexity of systems is relative and that many conventional mathematical models have been very productive in spite of their complexity.

Soft computing deals with imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and approximation to achieve computability, robustness and low solution cost. As such it forms the basis of a considerable amount of [[machine learning]] techniques. Recent trends tend to involve evolutionary and swarm intelligence based algorithms and bio-inspired computation.&lt;ref&gt;X. S. Yang, Z. H. Cui, R. Xiao, A. Gandomi, M. Karamanoglu, Swarm Intelligence and Bio-Inspired Computation: Theory and Applications, Elsevier, (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. K. Chaturvedi, "Soft Computing: Techniques and Its Applications in Electrical Engineering", Springer, (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Components of soft computing include:
*[[Machine learning]], including:
** [[Neural network]]s (NN)
*** [[Perceptron]]
** [[Support Vector Machine]]s (SVM)
* [[Fuzzy logic]] (FL)
* [[Evolutionary computation]] (EC), including:
** [[Evolutionary algorithm]]s
*** [[Genetic algorithm]]s
*** [[Differential evolution]]
** [[Metaheuristic]] and [[Swarm Intelligence]]
*** [[Ant colony optimization]]
*** [[Particle swarm optimization]]
* Ideas about [[probability]] including:
** [[Bayesian network]]

Generally speaking, soft computing techniques resemble biological processes more closely than traditional techniques, which are largely based on formal [[logical system]]s, such as [[sentential logic]] and [[predicate logic]], or rely heavily on computer-aided numerical analysis (as in [[finite element analysis]]). Soft computing techniques are intended to complement each other.

Unlike hard computing schemes, which strive for exactness and full truth, soft computing techniques exploit the given tolerance of imprecision, partial truth, and uncertainty for a particular problem. Another common contrast comes from the observation that [[inductive reasoning]] plays a larger role in soft computing than in hard computing.

'''Soviet art''' is the [[visual art]] that was produced in the [[Soviet Union]].

==Soviet Avant-Garde art==
[[File:Lenin_attempt.jpg|300px|thumb|right|alt=Vladimir Pchelin painting about Lenin's assassination attempt, from 1927|[[Vladimir Pchelin]]'s artwork about Lenin's assassination attempt, 1927]]
[[File:Malevich142.jpg|200px|thumb|right|alt=Kazimir Malevich abstract painting ''Mower'' from 1930|''Mower'' by [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], 1930]]
During the [[Bolshevik Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] a movement was initiated to put all arts to service of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. The instrument for this was created just days before the [[October Revolution]], known as [[Proletkult]], an abbreviation for "Proletarskie kulturno-prosvetitelnye organizatsii" (Proletarian Cultural and Enlightenment Organizations). A prominent theorist of this movement was [[Aleksandr Bogdanov]]. Initially [[Narkompros]] (ministry of education), which was also in charge of the arts, supported Proletkult. However the latter sought too much independence from the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of [[Bolsheviks]], gained negative attitude of [[Vladimir Lenin]], by 1922 declined considerably, and was eventually disbanded in 1932.
The ideas of Proletkult attracted the interests of [[Russian avantgarde]], who strived to  get rid of the conventions of "bourgeois art". Among notable persons of this movement was [[Kazimir Malevich]]. However the ideas of the avantgarde eventually clashed with the newly emerged state-sponsored direction of [[Socialist Realism]].

In search of new forms of expression, the Proletkult organisation was highly eclectic in its art forms, and thus was prone to harsh criticism for inclusion of such modern directions as [[impressionism]] and [[cubism]], since these movements existed before the revolution and hence were associated with "decadent bourgeois art".

Among early experiments of Proletkult was [[pragmaic aesthetic|pragmatic aesthetic]] of [[industrial art]], the prominent theoretist being [[Boris Arvatov]].

Another group was [[UNOVIS]], a very short-lived but influential collection of young artists led by [[Kasimir Malevich]] in the 1920s.

==Socialist realism==
{{Main|Socialist realism}}

Officially approved art was required to follow the doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]]. In the spring of 1932, the Central Committee of the Communist Party decreed that all existing literary and artistic groups and organizations should be disbanded and replaced with unified associations of creative professions. Accordingly, the Moscow and Leningrad Union of Artists was established on August 1932, which brought the history of post-revolutionary art to a close. The epoch of Soviet art began.&lt;ref&gt;Sergei V. Ivanov. ''Unknown Socialist Realism: The Leningrad School'', pp. 28–29. {{ISBN|5-901724-21-6}}, {{ISBN|978-5-901724-21-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Soviet artists were [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Aleksandr Deyneka]], [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Laktionov|Aleksandr Laktionov]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]] and other painters from Moscow and Leningrad School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradartist.com/outline.htm ''Segei V. Ivanov.'' The Leningrad School of painting 1930 – 1990s. Historical outline.]&lt;/ref&gt; Moscow artist [[Aleksandr Gerasimov (painter)|Aleksandr Gerasimov]] during his career produced a large number of heroic paintings of [[Joseph Stalin]] and other members of the [[Politburo]]. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] later alleged that [[Kliment Voroshilov]] spent more time posing in Gerasimov's studio than he did attending to his duties in the People's Commissariat of Defense. Gerasimov's painting shows a mastery of classical representational techniques.

However, art exhibitions of 1935–1960 disprove the claims that artistic life of the period was suppressed by the ideology and artists submitted entirely to what was then called ‘social order’. A great number of landscapes, portraits, genre paintings and studies exhibited at the time pursued purely technical purposes and were thus free from any ideology. Thematic painting was also approached in a similar way.&lt;ref&gt;Vern G. Swanson, ''Soviet Impressionist Painting.'' Woodbridge, England: Antique Collectors' Club, 2008; p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war period between the mid-1950s and 1960s, the [[:ru:Ленинградская школа живописи|Leningrad school]] was approaching its apex. Artists who had graduated from the Academy ([[Repin Institute of Arts]]) in the 1930s–50s were in their prime. They were quick to present their art, they strived for experiments and were eager to appropriate a lot and to learn even more. Their time and contemporaries, with all its images, ideas and dispositions found it full expression in portraits by [[:ru:Русов, Лев Александрович|Lev Russov]], [[:ru:Орешников, Виктор Михайлович|Victor Oreshnikov]], Boris Korneev, Semion Rotnitsky, Vladimir Gorb, Engels Kozlov, landscapes by [[:ru:Тимков, Николай Ефимович|Nikolai Timkov]], [[:ru:Овчинников, Владимир Иванович|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[:ru:Осипов, Сергей Иванович|Sergei Osipov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Александр Михайлович|Alexander Semionov]], [[:ru:Семенов, Арсений Никифорович|Arseny Semionov]], Nikolai Galakhov, genre paintings by [[:ru:Позднеев, Николай Матвеевич|Nikolai Pozdneev]], [[:ru:Непринцев, Юрий Михайлович|Yuri Neprintsev]], Yevsey Moiseenko, Andrey Milnikov. Art of this period showed extraordinary taste for life and creative work.

In 1957, the first all-Russian Congress of Soviet artists took place in Moscow. In 1960, the all-Russian Union of Artists was organized. Accordingly, these events influenced the art life in Moscow, Leningrad and province. The scope of experimentation was broadened; in particular, this concerned the form and painterly and plastic language. Images of youths and students, rapidly changing villages and cities, virgin lands brought under cultivation, grandiose construction plans being realized in Siberia and the Volga region, great achievements of Soviet science and technology became the chief topics of the new painting. Heroes of the time – young scientists, workers, civil engineers, physicians – become the most popular heroes of paintings.

At this period, life provided artists with plenty of thrilling topics, positive figures and images. Legacy of many great artists and [[art movements]] became available for study and public discussions again. This greatly broadened artists’ understanding of the [[realist art|realist method]] and widened its possibilities. It was the repeated renewal of the very conception of [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that made this style dominates in the [[Russian art]] throughout its history. Realist tradition gave rise to many trends of [[Contemporary art|contemporary painting]], including painting from nature, "severe style" painting and decorative art. However, during this period [[impressionism]], [[postimpressionism]], [[cubism]] and [[expressionism]] also had their fervent adherents and interpreters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leningradschool.com/outline.htm ''Sergei V.

==Soviet Nonconformist Art==
{{Main|Soviet Nonconformist Art}}

The death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, and [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Khrushchev Thaw|Thaw]], paved the way for a wave of liberalization in the arts throughout the [[Soviet Union]].  Although no official change in policy took place, artists began to feel free to experiment in their work, with considerably less fear of repercussions than during the Stalinist period.

In the 1950s Moscow artist [[Ely Bielutin]] encouraged his students to experiment with [[abstractionism]], a practice thoroughly discouraged by the [[Creative unions in the Soviet Union|Artists' Union]], which strictly enforced the official policy of [[Socialist Realism]].  Artists who chose to paint in alternative styles had to do so completely in private and were never able to exhibit or sell their work. As a result, [[Nonconformist Art]] developed along a separate path than the [[Official Art]] that was recorded in the history books.

[[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine published two portraits by two painters, who to their mind, were most representative of Russian Arts of the period: it was Serov, an official Soviet icon and [[Anatoly Zverev]], an underground [[Russian avant-garde]] expressionist.  Serov's portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and Zverev's selfportrait were associated by many with an eternal Biblical struggle of Satan and Saviour.  When Khrushchev learned about the publication he was outraged and forbade all contacts with Western visitors, closed down all semi legal exhibitions.  And of course Zverev was the main target of his outrage.

The [[Soviet Nonconformist Art#Lianozovo|Lianozovo Group]] was formed around the artist [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]] in the 1960s and included artists such as [[Valentina Kropivnitskaya]], [[Vladimir Nemukhin]], and [[Lydia Masterkova]].  While not adhering to any common style, these artists sought to faithfully express themselves in the mode they deemed appropriate, rather than adhere to the propagandistic style of [[Socialist Realism]].

Tolerance of Nonconformist Art by the authorities underwent an ebb and flow until the ultimate collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991.  Artists took advantage of the first few years after the death of Stalin to experiment in their work without the fear of persecution.  In 1962, artists experienced a slight setback when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] appeared at the exhibition of the 30th anniversary of the Moscow Artist's Union at the [[Moscow Manege]] exhibition hall, an episode known as the [[Manege Affair]].  Among the customary works of [[Socialist Realism]] were a few abstract works by artists such as [[Ernst Neizvestny]] and [[Eli Beliutin]], which Khrushchev criticized as being "shit," and the artists for being "homosexuals."  The message was clear: artistic policy was not as liberal as everyone had hoped.

The history of late Soviet art has been dominated by politics and simplistic formulae. Both within the artworld and the general public, very little consideration has been given to the aesthetic character of the work produced in the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, the official and unofficial art of the period usually stood in for either "bad" or "good" political developments.  A more nuanced picture would emphasize that there were numerous competing groups making art in Moscow and Leningrad throughout this period. The most important figures for the international art scene have been the Moscow artists Ilya Kabakov, Erik Bulatov, Andrei Monastyrsky, Vitaly Komar and Aleksandr Melamid.

The most infamous incident regarding nonconformist artists in the former Soviet Union was the 1974 [[Bulldozer Exhibition]], which took place in a park just outside Moscow, and included work by such artists as [[Oscar Rabin (artist)|Oscar Rabin]], [[Komar and Melamid]], [[Alexandr Zhdanov]], [[Nikolai Smoliakov]] and [[Leonid Sokov]].  The artists involved had written to the authorities for permission to hold the exhibition but received no answer to their request.  They decided to go ahead with the exhibition anyway, which consisted solely of unofficial works of art that did not fit into the rubric of [[Socialist Realism]].  The [[KGB]] put an end to the exhibition just hours after it opened by bringing in bulldozers to completely destroy all of the artworks present.  However, the foreign press had been there to witness the event, and the worldwide coverage of it forced the authorities to permit an exhibition of Nonconformist Art two weeks later in [[Izmailovsky Park]] in Moscow.

A few West European collectors, supported during the 60th and the 70th and until 1988 (the year of the Perestroika) many of the artists in the old Soviet Union. One of the leading collectors and philanthropists were the couple Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera. The Bar-Gera Collection consists of some 200 works of 59 Soviet Russian artists of who did not want to embrace the official art directive of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union. Kenda and Jacob Bar-Gera, both are survivors of the holocaust, supported these partially persecuted artists by sending them money or painting material from Germany to the Soviet Union. Even though the Kenda and Jacob did not meet the artists in person, they bought many of their paintings and other art objects. The works were smuggled to Germany by hiding them in the suitcases of diplomats, traveling businessmen, and students, thus making the Bar-Gera Collection of Russian Non-Conformists among the largest of its kind in the world. Among others, the collection content works of Bachtschanjan Vagritsch, Jankilevskij Wladimir,Rabin  Oskar, Batschurin Ewganij, Kabakov Ilja, Schablavin Sergei, Belenok Piotr, Krasnopevcev Dimitrij, Schdanov Alexander, [[Igor Novikov (painter)|Igor Novikov]],
Bitt Galina, Kropivnitzkaja Walentina, Schemjakin Michail, Bobrowskaja Olga, Kropivnitzkij Lew,Schwarzman  Michail, Borisov  Leonid, Kropiwnizkij Jewgenij, Sidur  Vadim, Bruskin Grischa, Kulakov  Michail, Sitnikov  Wasili, and many others.

By the 1980s, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s policies of [[Perestroika]] and [[Glasnost]] made it virtually impossible for the authorities to place restrictions on artists or their freedom of expression.  With the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], the new market economy enabled the development of a gallery system, which meant that artists no longer had to be employed by the state, and could create work according to their own tastes, as well as the tastes of their private patrons.  Consequently, after around 1986 the phenomenon of Nonconformist Art in the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

'''Suberin''', [[cutin]] and [[lignin]]s are complex, higher plant epidermis and periderm cell-wall macromolecules, forming a protective barrier. Suberin, a complex polyester [[biopolymer]], is lipophilic, and composed of long chain fatty acids called suberin acids, and glycerol. Suberins and lignins are considered covalently linked to lipids and carbohydrates, respectively, and lignin is covalently linked to suberin, and to a lesser extent, to cutin.&lt;ref&gt;{{PMID|17801473}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{PMID|26579510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernard&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bernards|first=M.A.|title=Demystifying suberin|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|date=March 2002|volume=80|issue=3|pages=227–240(14)|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/nrc/cjb/2002/00000080/00000003/art00001#expand/collapse|accessdate=13 September 2012|doi=10.1139/b02-017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suberin is a major constituent of [[cork (material)|cork]], and is named after the [[cork oak]], ''Quercus suber''. Its main function is as a barrier to movement of [[water]] and [[solutes]].

==Anatomy and physiology==
Suberin is highly [[hydrophobic]] and a somewhat 'rubbery' material. In [[root]]s suberin is deposited in the radial and transverse [[cell wall]]s of the endodermal [[cell (biology)|cells]]. This structure, known as the [[Casparian strip]] or Casparian band, functions to prevent water and nutrients taken up by the root from entering the [[Stele (biology)|stele]] through the [[apoplast]]. Instead, water must bypass the [[endodermis]] via the [[symplast]]. This allows the plant to select the solutes that pass further into the plant. It thus forms an important barrier to harmful solutes.&lt;ref name="Kolattukudy1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolattukudy|first1=P. E.|title=Biochemistry and function of cutin and suberin|journal=Canadian Journal of Botany|volume=62|issue=12|year=1984|pages=2918–2933|issn=0008-4026|doi=10.1139/b84-391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[mangrove]]s use suberin to minimize [[salt]] intake from their [[littoral]] habitat.

Suberin is found in the [[phellem]] layer of the [[periderm]] (or cork). This is outermost layer of the [[Bark (botany)|bark]]. The cells in this layer are dead and abundant in suberin, preventing water loss from the tissues below. Suberin can also be found in various other plant structures. For example, they are present in the [[lenticel]]s on the stems of many plants and the net structure in the rind of a [[netted melon]] is composed of suberised cells.

==Structure and biosynthesis==
Suberin consists of two domains, a [[aromatic|polyaromatic]] and a [[aliphatic|polyaliphatic]] domain.&lt;ref name="Kolattukudy1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolattukudy|first1=P. E.|title=Biopolyester Membranes of Plants: Cutin and Suberin|journal=Science|volume=208|issue=4447|year=1980|pages=990–1000|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.208.4447.990|pmid=17779010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polyaromatics are predominantly located within the primary cell wall, and the polyaliphatics are located between the [[primary cell wall]] and the [[cell membrane]]. The two domains are supposed to be cross-linked. The exact qualitative and quantitative composition of suberin [[monomer]]s varies in different species. Some common [[aliphatic]] monomers include α-hydroxyacids (mainly 18-hydroxyoctadec-9-enoic acid) and α,ω-diacids (mainly octadec-9-ene-1,18-dioic acid). The monomers of the polyaromatics are [[hydroxycinnamic acid]]s and derivatives, such as feruloyltyramine.

In addition to the aromatics and aliphatics components, [[glycerol]] has been reported a major suberin component in some [[species]]. The role of glycerol is proposed to interlink aliphatic monomers, and possibly also to link polyaliphatics to polyaromatics, during suberin [[polymer]] assembly. The [[polymerization]] step of aromatic monomers has been shown to involve a [[peroxidase]] reaction.

The [[biosynthesis]] of the aliphatic monomers shares the same upstream reactions with [[cutin]] biosynthesis, and the biosynthesis of aromatics shares the same upstream reactions with [[lignin]] biosynthesis.

[[Phlobaphen]] also occurs in the polyaromatic part of the suberin mixture.

'''''The Art of Biblical Narrative''''' is a 1981 book by [[Robert Alter]]. In it, Alter outlines a literary approach to the [[Hebrew Bible]]. He proposes that "the Bible in its final form constitutes an artistic document with a full texture of interconnected unity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trible|first1=Phyllis|author-link=Phyllis Trible|title=Rhetorical Criticism: Context, Method, and the Book of Jonah|date=1994|publisher=[[Fortress Press]]|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hIp0zV_tqaAC&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Art of Biblical Narrative'' has been very influential: it "revolutionized the way that scholars read the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiss|first1=Anthony|title=An Alter-ed Perspective on the Bible|url=http://forward.com/articles/146729/an-alter-ed-perspective-on-the-bible/|accessdate=4 September 2016|work=[[The Forward]]|date=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Weitzman suggests that "By the most conventional measures—number of books sold, favorable reviews, frequency of citation—it is hard to imagine a more successful academic book than Alter's ''The Art of Biblical Narrative''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2979/pft.2007.27.2.191| issn = 0272-9601| volume = 27| issue = 2| pages = 191–210| last = Weitzman| first = Steven| title = Before and After The Art of Biblical Narrative| journal = Prooftexts |date = 2007| jstor = 10.2979/pft.2007.27.2.191}} Quotation on p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turkish Space Systems, Integration and Test Centre''' ({{lang-tr|Uzay Sistemleri, Entegrasyon ve Test Merkezi}}) (USET) is a [[spacecraft]] production and testing facility owned by the [[Ministry of National Defence (Turkey)|Ministry of National Defence]] and operated by [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]] (TAI). It is located in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]].&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt; The facility's official inauguration took place on May 21, 2015 in presence of [[President of Turkey|President]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]].&lt;ref name="m2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="h2"/&gt;

Considered as a critical infrastructure, the centre was established within the framework of the [[Göktürk-1]] project, which started in 2009, for the indigenous realization of satellite assembly, as well as for [[qualification testing|qualification]] and [[acceptance testing]] from design to launch phase. It was the product of an agreement between the Turkish Ministry of National Defence and the multinational space services company [[Telespazio]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="tg"/&gt; Situated within TAI's grounds in the [[Kazan, Ankara|Kazan]] district of [[Ankara Province]], the budgeted cost of the facility is US$100 million.&lt;ref name="m1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tz1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bksv"/&gt;

USET is a technology centre, at which all satellites up to {{convert|5000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} mass can be assembled and tested in simulated space environmental conditions related to the orbit. Two satellites can be produced and tested at the simultaneously. The centre serves military and civilian institutions.&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iix"/&gt;

Development of the [[Turksat (satellite)|Türksat series]] [[communication satellite]]s, starting with [[Türksat 5A]], and Göktürk series [[earth observation satellite]]s, will be carried out by Turkish engineers at this site.&lt;ref name="ntv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="u"/&gt;

At the end of November 2014, it was announced that the construction of the facility was completed, and the centre was put into operation. The centre's Class 100,000 clean rooms cover an area of around {{convert|3800|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="tg"/&gt; It is capable of the assembly, integration and testing of several satellites of type [[Low Earth orbit]] (LEO) and [[Geosynchronous orbit]] (GEO) with a mass up to five tonnes simultaneously.&lt;ref name="tai2"/&gt; It has a direct connection to the airbase so that a transport by land becomes needless, offering advantages of security, economy and risk management.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

The centre has the following capabilities:
* [[Thermal vacuum chamber|thermal vacuum]] tests,
* [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]]/[[electromagnetic compatibility|EMC]] tests,
* [[Antenna measurement|compact antenna measurement range]] (CATR) tests,
* [[Photovoltaic systems|solar array]] deployment tests,
* [[vibration]] tests,
* [[mass properties]] measurement,
* [[Acoustics|acoustic]] tests, and
* [[Multi-layer insulation|MLI]] preparation.&lt;ref name="tg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tai2"/&gt;

The advanced integration and environmental tests of Göktürk-1 is the first project to be carried out in the centre. After completion, the satellite will be sent to the launch site by TUSAŞ.&lt;ref name="h1"/&gt;

[[File:VertiCrop.jpg|thumb|Lettuce grown in indoor vertical farming system]]

'''Vertical farming''' is the practice of producing food and medicine in vertically stacked layers, vertically inclined surfaces and/or integrated in other structures (such as in a skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container). The modern ideas of vertical farming use indoor farming techniques and [[controlled-environment agriculture]] (CEA) technology, where all environmental factors can be controlled. These facilities utilize artificial control of light, environmental control (humidity, temperature, gases...) and [[fertigation]]. Some vertical farms use techniques similar to [[greenhouse]]s, where natural [[sunlight]] can be augmented with artificial [[lighting]] and [[metal]] [[Mirror|reflectors]].&lt;ref name="Hix, John 1974"&gt;Hix, John. 1974.

Hydroponic systems can be lit by LEDs that mimic sunlight. Software can ensure that all the plants get the same amount of light, water and nutrients. Proper managements means that no herbicides or pesticides are required.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22129524-100-vertical-farms-sprouting-all-over-the-world/|title=Vertical farms sprouting all over the world|last=Marks|first=Paul|date=15 January 2014|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The term "vertical farming" was coined by Gilbert Ellis Bailey in 1915 in his book ''Vertical Farming''. His use of the term differs from the current meaning—he wrote about [[farming]] with a special interest in soil origin, its nutrient content and the view of plant life as "vertical" life forms, specifically relating to their underground root structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924000349328 |title=Vertical farming (1915) |publisher=E. I. duPont de Nemours Powder Co. |location=Wilmington, Del.  |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern usage of the term "vertical farming" usually refers to growing plants in layers, whether in a multistory skyscraper, used warehouse, or shipping container.

===Mixed-use skyscrapers===
Mixed-use skyscrapers were proposed and built by architect [[Ken Yeang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.architecture.org.au/news/enews/354-ken-yeang-and-bioclimatic-architecture|title=Ken Yeang and Bioclimatic Architecture|website=www.architecture.org.au|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeang proposes that instead of hermetically sealed mass-produced agriculture, plant life should be cultivated within open air, mixed-use skyscrapers for climate control and consumption. This version of vertical farming is based upon personal or community use rather than the wholesale production and distribution that aspires to feed an entire city.

===Despommier's skyscrapers===
Ecologist [[Dickson Despommier]] argues that vertical farming is legitimate for environmental reasons. He claims that the cultivation of plant life within skyscrapers will require less [[embodied energy]] and produce less pollution than some methods of producing plant life on natural landscapes. He moreover claims that natural landscapes are too toxic for natural agricultural production, despite the ecological and environmental costs of extracting materials to build skyscrapers for the simple purpose of agricultural production.{{citation needed|reason=the 2nd part of the sentence sounds like a reader's inserted opinion, not Despommier's|date=February 2016}}

Despommier's concept of the vertical farm emerged in 1999 at [[Columbia University]]. It promotes the mass cultivation of plant life for commercial purposes in skyscrapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/science/15farm.html |title=Country, the City Version: Farms in the Sky Gain New Interest  |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date= 2008-07-15|accessdate=2011-01-05 |first=Bina |last=Venkataraman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stackable shipping containers===
Several companies have developed stacking recycled [[Intermodal_container|shipping containers]] in urban settings. Brighterside Consulting created a complete off-grid container system. [[Freight Farms]] produces a "leafy green machine" that is a complete [[farm-to-table]] system outfitted with vertical hydroponics, [[LED]] lighting and intuitive climate controls built within a 12&amp;nbsp;m &amp;times; 2.4&amp;nbsp;m shipping container.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1t-PUIXUPgw|title=2015 Leafy Green Machine by Freight Farms|first=|last=Freight Farms|date=12 April 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Podponics built a vertical farm in Atlanta consisting of over 100 stacked "growpods".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=zWommg6JVfY|title=PodPonics Info Video 3d Cut}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar farm is under construction in Oman.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=r-Iymp-gdbo|title=PodPonics Oman Video Blog Part 1|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=PrLTuGKcvPA|title=Oman Video Blog Part 2: Ramadan}}&lt;/ref&gt; TerraFarms offer a proprietary&lt;ref name="localrootsfarms-how-we-farm-tech"&gt;{{cite web

Controlling light governs the growth cycle of the plant. E.g., infrared LEDs can mimic 5 minutes of sunset, stimulating some plants to begin flowering.&lt;ref name="arstechnica-science-2017-12-local-roots-farm-in-a-box"/&gt;

==Technology==
Lighting can be natural or via LEDs. As of 2018 commercial LEDs were about 28 per cent efficient, which keeps the cost of produce high and prevents vertical farms from competing in regions where cheap vegetables are abundant. However, lighting engineers at [[Philips]] have demonstrated LEDs with 68 per cent efficiency.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Energy costs can be reduced because full-spectrum white light is not required. Instead, red and blue or purple light can be generated with less electricity.

==History==
One of the earliest drawings of a tall building that cultivates food was published in ''[[Life Magazine]]'' in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[https://store.ctbuh.org/PDF_Previews/Journal/CTBUHJournal_2009-2.pdf Nakheel Harbor and Tower] &lt;/ref&gt; The reproduced drawings feature vertically stacked homesteads set amidst a farming landscape. This proposal can be seen in [[Rem Koolhaas]]'s ''Delirious New York''.  Koolhaas wrote that this 1909 theorem is 'The Skyscraper as Utopian device for the production of unlimited numbers of virgin sites on a metropolitan location'.&lt;ref name="Koolhaas2014"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=163oAwAAQBAJ}}|title=Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan|last=Koolhaas|first=Rem|date=1 July 2014|publisher=Monacelli Press|isbn=978-1-58093-410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydroponicum ===
Early architectural proposals that contributge to VF include [[Le Corbusier]]'s Immeubles-Villas (1922) and SITE's Highrise of Homes (1972).&lt;ref name="abc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruby|first1=Ilka|last2=Ruby|first2=Andreas|title=Groundscapes: el reencuentro con el suelo en la arquitectura contemporánea|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=mglNAAAAYAAJ}}|year=2006|publisher=G.

Images of the vertical farms at the School of Gardeners in Langenlois, Austria, and the glass tower at the Vienna International Horticulture Exhibition (1964) show that vertical farms existed.&lt;ref name="Hix, John 1974" /&gt; The technological precedents that make vertical farming possible can be traced back to horticultural history through the development of [[greenhouse]] and [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] technology. Early [[Hydroponicum|hydroponicums]] integrated hydroponic technology into building systems. These [[horticultural building system]]s evolved from greenhouse technology.  The British Interplanetary Society developed a [[hydroponicum]] for lunar conditions, while other building prototypes were developed during the early days of space exploration. The first Tower Hydroponic Units were developed in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Hydroponics problems|url=http://academy.academy-info.com/index.php?LMID=National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Armenia&amp;ID=11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811024138/http://academy.academy-info.com/index.php?LMID=National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Armenia&amp;ID=11 |archivedate=August 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian tower hydroponicums are the first built examples of a vertical farm, and are documented in Sholto Douglas' ''[[Hydroponics]]: The Bengal System,'' first published in 1951 with data from the then-[[East Pakistan]], today's [[Bangladesh]], and the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps-survival.com/PS/Hydroponics/Hydroponics_The_Bengal_System_1959.pdf|title=link|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ps-survival.com/PS/Hydroponics/Hydroponics_The_Bengal_System_1959.pdf Hydroponics The Bengal System]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sholto Douglas 1975"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=obVOSgAACAAJ}}|title=Hydroponics: The Bengal System|last1=Douglas|first1=James Sholto|date=1975|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195605662|edition=5th|location=New Dehli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later precursors that have been published, or built, are Ken Yeang's Bioclimatic Skyscraper (Menara Mesiniaga, built 1992); MVRDV's PigCity, 2000; MVRDV's Meta City/ Datatown (1998–2000); Pich-Aguilera's Garden Towers (2001).&lt;ref name="abc" /&gt;

Ken Yeang is perhaps the most widely known architect who has promoted the idea of the 'mixed-use' Bioclimatic Skyscraper which combines living units and food production.

=== Vertical farm ===
[[Dickson Despommier]] is a professor of [[environmental health]] sciences and [[microbiology]]. He reopened the topic of VF in 1999 with graduate students in a medical ecology class. He speculated that a 30-floor farm on one city block could provide food for 50,000 people including vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat, explaining that hydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; while the lower floors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plant waste.

Although many of Despommier's suggestions have been challenged from an environmental science and engineering point of view, Despommier successfully popularized his assertion that food production can be transformed. Critics claimed that the additional energy needed for artificial lighting, heating and other operations would outweigh the benefit of the building's close proximity to the areas of consumption.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21154137/|title=Could vertical farming be the future? Nelson, B. (2008).|last=Nelson|first=Bryn|date=2007-12-12|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/16/green-ivory-towers-farm-skyscrapers|title=Monbiot, G. (16 August 2010). Greens living in ivory towers now want to farm them too.|author=George Monbiot|date=2010-08-16|accessdate=2010-11-10|publisher=''The Guardian''|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despommier originally challenged his class to feed the entire population of [[Manhattan]] (about 2,000,000 people) using only {{convert|13|acre|ha|order=flip|0}} of [[rooftop gardens]]. The class calculated that rooftop gardening methods could feed only two percent of the population. Unsatisfied with the results, Despommier made an off-the-cuff suggestion of growing plants indoors, vertically. By 2001 the first outline of a vertical farm was introduced. In an interview Despommier described how vertical farms would function:

{{quote|Each floor will have its own watering and nutrient monitoring systems. There will be sensors for every single plant that tracks how much and what kinds of nutrients the plant has absorbed. You'll even have systems to monitor plant diseases by employing DNA chip technologies that detect the presence of plant pathogens by simply sampling the air and using snippets from various viral and bacterial infections. It's very easy to do.

Moreover, a gas [[chromatograph]] will tell us when to pick the plant by analyzing which [[Flavonoid|flavenoids]] the produce contains. These flavonoids are what gives the food the flavors you're so fond of, particularly for more aromatic produce like tomatoes and peppers. These are all right-off-the-shelf technologies. The ability to construct a vertical farm exists now. We don't have to make anything new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Arnie Cooper |date=May 19, 2009 |url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/science_environment/farming-in-high-rises-raises-hopes-1226 |title=Going up?

In 2011 the Plant in [[Chicago]] was building an [[anaerobic digestion#Power generation|anaerobic digester]] into the building. This will allow the farm to operate off the energy grid. Moreover, the anaerobic digester will be recycling waste from nearby businesses that would otherwise go into landfills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantchicago.com/about-the-plant/|title=About The Plant|publisher=The Plant|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204102733/http://www.plantchicago.com/about-the-plant/|archivedate=2011-12-04|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Association for Vertical Farming]] was founded in [[Munich]], Germany.

As of 2014, Vertical Fresh Farms was operating in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, specializing in [[salad greens]], [[herb]]s and sprouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vertical Fresh Farms LLC, Buffalo, NY {{!}} StateLog|url = http://www.statelog.com/vertical-fresh-farms-llc-buffalo-ny|website = www.statelog.com|accessdate = 2015-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March the world’s then largest vertical farm opened in Scranton, Pennsylvania, built by Green Spirit Farms (GSF). The firm is housed in a single story building covering 3.25 hectares, with racks stacked six high to house 17 million plants. The farm was to grow 14 lettuce crops per year, as well as spinach, kale, tomatoes, peppers, basil and strawberries. Water is scavenged from the farm's atmosphere with a [[dehumidifier]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2015 study utilized inexpensive [[metal]] [[Mirror|reflectors]] to supply sunlight to the plants, reducing energy costs.&lt;ref name="bowenpublishing.com" /&gt;

Kyoto-based Nuvege (pronounced “new veggie”) operates a windowless farm. Its LED lighting is tuned to service two types of chlorophyll, one preferring red light and the other blue. Nuvege produces 6 million lettuce heads a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The US [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] operates an 18-story project that produces [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] plants that make [[Protein|proteins]] useful in [[Vaccine|vaccines]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Problems==

===Economics===
Opponents question the potential profitability of vertical farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clive Clifton says: |url=http://e4capital.com/2009/08/24/vertical-farming/ |title=Vertical Farming: Too Far Outside the Box? &amp;#124; |publisher=E4capital.com |date=2009-08-24 |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its economic and environmental benefits rest partly on the concept of minimizing [[food miles]], the distance that food travels from farm to consumer.{{original research inline|date=September 2011}} However, a recent analysis suggests that transportation is only a minor contributor to the economic and environmental costs of supplying food to urban populations. The analysis concluded that "food miles are, at best, a marketing fad."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, P. (July 22, 2009). Local food no green panacea: professor. CBC News http://www.cbc.ca/consumer/story/2009/07/22/consumer-local-food.html&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the facility would have to lower costs or charge higher prices to justify remaining in a city.

Similarly, if power needs are met by fossil fuels, the environmental effect may be a net loss;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/17647627?story_id=17647627&amp;fsrc=rss | work=The Economist | title=Does it really stack up? | date=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; even building low-carbon capacity to power the farms may not make as much sense as simply leaving traditional farms in place, while burning less coal.

The initial building costs would exceed $100 million, for a 60 hectare vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/greenbus.htm |title=Starting a Commercial Greenhouse Business |publisher=Omafra.gov.on.ca |date=2003-07-28 |accessdate=2010-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051024230113/http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/greenbus.htm |archivedate=2005-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Office [[occupancy cost]]s can be high in major cities, with office space in cities such as [[Tokyo]], [[Moscow]], [[Mumbai]], [[Dubai]], [[Milan]], [[Zurich]], and [[Sao Paulo]] ranging from $1850 to $880 per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;Pocket World in Figures, [[The Economist]], 2011 ed. pg 64&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers of the TerraFarm system produced from second hand, 40&amp;nbsp;foot shipping containers claimed that their system "has achieved cost parity with traditional, outdoor farming".&lt;ref name="arstechnica-science-2017-12-local-roots-farm-in-a-box"&gt;{{cite web

===Energy use===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:B11architecture exteriors040.jpg|thumb|A [[greenhouse]] with its lights on at night, contributing to ''[[light pollution]]'']] --&gt;

During the growing season, the sun shines on a vertical surface at an extreme angle such that much less light is available to crops than when they are planted on flat land. Therefore, supplemental light would be required. Bruce Bugbee claimed that the power demands of vertical farming would be uncompetitive with traditional farms using only natural light.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roach |first=J. |date=June 30, 2009 |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/06/090630-farm-towers-locally-grown.html |title=High-Rise Farms: The Future of Food?|publisher=National Geographic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental writer [[George Monbiot]] calculated that the cost of providing enough supplementary light to grow the grain for a single loaf would be about $15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2010/08/16/towering-lunacy/ |title=George Monbiot – Towering Lunacy |publisher=Monbiot.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in the Economist argued that "even though crops growing in a glass skyscraper will get some natural sunlight during the day, it won't be enough" and "the cost of powering artificial lights will make indoor farming prohibitively expensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Economist |date=December 9, 2010 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17647627 |title=Vertical farming: Does it really stack up?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As "The Vertical Farm" proposes a controlled environment, heating and cooling costs will resemble those of any other tower. Plumbing and elevator systems are necessary to distribute nutrients and water. In the northern continental United States, fossil fuel heating cost can be over $200,000 per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/agriculture/crops/greenhouse/bng01s01.html |title=Crops &amp;#124; Greenhouse &amp;#124; Greenhouse Energy Calculations &amp;#124; Manitoba Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives &amp;#124; Province of Manitoba |publisher=Gov.mb.ca |accessdate=2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
Depending on the method of electricity generation used, greenhouse [[produce]] can create more greenhouse gases than field produce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719125741/http://www.lcafood.dk/Material/How%20to%20prepare.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; largely due to higher energy use per kilogram. Vertical farms require much greater energy per kilogram versus regular greenhouses, mainly through increased lighting. The amount of pollution produced is dependent on how the energy is generated.

Greenhouses commonly supplement [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] levels to 3–4 times the atmospheric rate. This increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases photosynthesis rates by 50%, contributing to higher yields.&lt;ref name="Blom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carbon Dioxide In Greenhouses|last=Blom|first=T.J.|author2=W.A. Straver |author3=F.J. Ingratta |author4=Shalin Khosla |author5= Wayne Brown |url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/00-077.htm|date=December 2002|accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some greenhouses burn fossil fuels purely for this purpose, as other CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sources, such as those from furnaces, contain pollutants such as [[sulphur dioxide]] and [[ethylene]] which significantly damage plants.&lt;ref name="Blom"/&gt;  This means a vertical farm requires a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; source, most likely from [[combustion]]. Also, necessary ventilation may allow CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to leak into the atmosphere.

Greenhouse growers commonly exploit [[photoperiodism]] in plants to control whether the plants are in a vegetative or reproductive stage. As part of this control, the lights stay on past sunset and before sunrise or periodically throughout the night. Single story greenhouses have attracted criticism over [[light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=61B_RV3EdIcC|page=163}}|title=Light pollution handbook – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |accessdate=2010-11-10|isbn=978-1-4020-2665-2|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroponic greenhouses regularly change the water, producing water containing fertilizers and pesticides that must be disposed of. The most common method of spreading the effluent over neighbouring farmland or [[wetlands]] would be more difficult for an urban vertical farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/greenhouse/nursery/environ/wmrecyc.html |title=Treating and Recycling Irrigation Runoff |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, Vertical Harvest was raising funds for an urban, small-scale vertical farm in [[Jackson Hole]], [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/vertical-harvest-of-jackson-hole-will-grow-organic-produce-even-in-the-winter/|title=Vertical Harvest of Jackson Hole Will Grow Organic Produce Even in the Winter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
Many of VF's potential benefits are obtained from scaling up hydroponic or [[aeroponic]] growing methods.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I |publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |accessdate= 2009-06-26 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090701091951/http://www.verticalfarm.com/essay_print.htm |archivedate= 2009-07-01 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study estimated that the value of four ecosystem services provided by existing vegetation in urban areas was on the order of $33 billion annually. The study's quantitative framework projected annual food production of 100–180 million tonnes, energy savings ranging from 14 to 15 billion kilowatt hours, nitrogen sequestration between 100,000 and 170,000 tonnes and stormwater runoff reductions between 45 and 57 billion cubic meters annually. Food production, nitrogen fixation, energy savings, pollination, climate regulation, soil formation and biological pest control could be worth as much as $80–160 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clinton|first=Nicholas|last2=Stuhlmacher|first2=Michelle|last3=Miles|first3=Albie|last4=Uludere Aragon|first4=Nazli|last5=Wagner|first5=Melissa|last6=Georgescu|first6=Matei|last7=Herwig|first7=Chris|last8=Gong|first8=Peng|date=2018-01-01|title=A Global Geospatial Ecosystem Services Estimate of Urban Agriculture|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017EF000536/abstract|journal=Earth's Future|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|pages=40–60|doi=10.1002/2017ef000536|issn=2328-4277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation for the future===
It is estimated that by the year 2050, the world's population will increase by 3 billion people and close to 80% will live in urban areas.&lt;ref name=vf&gt;{{cite web|website=The Vertical Farm Project |year=2009 |title=Agriculture for the 21st Century and Beyond |url=http://www.verticalfarm.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical farms have the potential to reduce or eliminate the need to create additional farmland.&lt;ref name=vf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frediani |first=K. L. |title=Feeding time at the Zoo. |journal=The Horticulturalist |date=April 2010 |pp=12–15 |publisher=Institute of Horticulture}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frediani |first=K. L. |date= October 2011|title=High rise food |journal=The Horticulturalist |pp=18–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased crop production===
Unlike traditional farming in non-tropical areas, indoor farming can produce crops year-round. All-season farming multiplies the productivity of the farmed surface by a factor of 4 to 6 depending on the crop. With crops such as strawberries, the factor may be as high as 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Despommier |first= D. |title= Vertical Farm Essay I|publisher= Vertical Farm |date= 2008 |url= http://www.verticalfarm.com/?page_id=36 |accessdate= 2009-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Vertical Farm Video |publisher= Discovery Channel |date= 2009-04-23 |url= http://watch.discoverychannel.ca/daily-planet/april-2009/daily-planet-april-23-2009/#clip164926 |accessdate= 2009-06-26 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090510091346/http://watch.discoverychannel.ca/daily-planet/april-2009/daily-planet-april-23-2009/#clip164926 |archive-date= 2009-05-10 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, as the crops would be consumed where they are grown, long-distance transport with its accompanying time delays, should reduce spoilage, infestation and energy needs. Globally some 30% of harvested crops are wasted due to spoilage and infestation, though this number is much lower in developed nations.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt;

Despommier suggests that once dwarf versions of crops (e.g. [[dwarf wheat]] which is smaller in size but richer in nutrients&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;{{cite web| title = Dwarf Wheat grown aboard the International Space Station | publisher = NASA| date = 9 February 2003| url = http://mix.msfc.nasa.gov/abstracts.php?p=2889| accessdate = 17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), year-round crops and "stacker" plant holders are accounted for, a 30-story building with a base of a building block ({{convert|5|acre|ha|0|order=flip}}) would yield a yearly crop analogous to that of {{convert|2400|acre|ha|order=flip|sigfig=1}} of traditional farming.&lt;ref name="sciam"/&gt;

===Weather disruption===
Crops grown in traditional outdoor farming depend on supportive weather, and suffer from undesirable temperatures rain, monsoon, hailstorm, tornadoe, flooding, wildfires and drought.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt; "Three recent floods (in 1993, 2007 and 2008) cost the United States billions of dollars in lost crops, with even more devastating losses in topsoil. Changes in rain patterns and temperature could diminish India's agricultural output by 30 percent by the end of the century."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/opinion/10pollan.html|title=Opinion {{!}} Big Food vs. Big Insurance|last=Pollan|first=Michael|date=2009-09-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VF productivity is mostly independent of weather, although earthquakes and tornadoes still pose threats.

=== Conservation ===
Up to 20 units of outdoor farmland per unit of VF could return to its natural state,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/opinion/24Despommier.html|title=Opinion {{!}} A Farm on Every Floor|last=Despommier|first=Dickson D.|date=2009-08-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-27|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainweb.org/pdf/11/ch_vertical_farming.pdf Vertical take off], ''Fresh Produce Journal'', 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; due to VR's increased productivity.

Vertical farming would thus reduce the amount of farmland, thus saving many natural resources.&lt;ref name="sciam"&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Despommier| first = Dickson| authorlink = Dickson Despommier| title = The Rise of Vertical Farms| journal = Scientific American| volume = 301| issue = 5| pages = 60–67| publisher = Scientific American Inc.| location = New york| date = November 2009| url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-rise-of-vertical-farms| issn = 0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deforestation and [[desertification]] caused by agricultural encroachment on natural [[biome]]s could be avoided. Producing food indoors reduces or eliminates conventional plowing, planting, and harvesting by farm machinery, protecting soil and reducing emissions.

===Resource scarcity===
The scarcity of fertilizer components like phosphorus&lt;ref name="phosphorus"&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100311092124.htm Expertanswer. "Scarcity of phosphorus threat to global food production". ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 17 March 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; poses a threat to industrial agriculture. The closed-cycle design of vertical farm systems minimizes the loss of nutrients, while traditional field agriculture loses nutrients to runoff and leeching.&lt;ref name="runoff"&gt;[https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR009i003p00658 Timmons, D. R., et al. “Nitrogen and Phosphorus Losses in Surface Runoff from Agricultural Land as Influenced by Placement of Broadcast Fertilizer.” Water Resources Research , June 1973, doi:https://doi.org/10.1029/WR009i003p00658.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass extinction===
Withdrawing human activity from large areas of the Earth's land surface may be necessary to address [[Holocene extinction event|anthropogenic mass extinction]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.

Traditional agriculture disrupts wild populations and may be [[Ethics of eating meat#Argument that plant consumption also kills animals|unethical]] given a viable alternative. One study showed that [[wood mouse]] populations dropped from 25 per hectare to 5 per hectare after harvest, estimating 10 animals killed per hectare each year with conventional farming.&lt;ref name="sldavis"&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human health===
Traditional farming is a hazardous occupation that often affects the health of farmers. Such risks include: exposure to infectious diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[schistosomes]], exposure to toxic pesticides and fungicides, confrontations with wildlife such as venomous snakes, and injuries that can occur when using large industrial farming equipment. VF reduces some of these risks.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt; The modern industrial food system makes unhealthy food cheap while fresh produce is more expensive, encouraging poor eating habits. These habits lead to health problems such as [[obesity]], [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]]. 

===Poverty and culture===
Food security is one of the primary factors leading to absolute poverty.  Constructing farms will allow continued growth of culturally significant food items without sacrificing sustainability or basic needs, which can be significant to the recovery of a society from poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/anthropology/21a-265-food-and-culture-spring-2011/|title=Food and Culture Spring 2011 course|work=ocw.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban growth===
Vertical farming, used in conjunction with other technologies and socioeconomic practices, could allow cities to expand while remaining substantially self-sufficient in food. This would allow large urban centers to grow without food constraints.&lt;ref name="verticalfarm1"/&gt;

===Energy sustainability===
Vertical farms could exploit [[methane digesters]] to generate energy.  Methane digesters could be built on site to transform the organic waste generated at the farm into [[biogas]] that is generally composed of 65% methane along with other gases. This biogas could then be burned to generate electricity for the greenhouse.&lt;ref&gt;Case Study&amp;nbsp;— Landfill Power Generation, H.

==Technologies and devices==
Vertical farming relies on the use of various physical methods to become effective. Combining these technologies and devices in an integrated whole is necessary to make Vertical Farming a reality. Various methods are proposed and under research. The most common technologies suggested are:

* [[Greenhouses]]
* The [[Folkewall]] and other vertical growing architectures&lt;ref name="Folkewalls"&gt;{{cite web|author=Folke Günther |url=http://www.holon.se/folke/projects/openliw/openlev_en.shtml |title=The folkewall, greywater purification AND vertical growing |publisher=Holon.se |date=2013-01-06 |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the world's first pilot production system was installed at Paignton Zoo Environmental Park in the United Kingdom. The project showcased vertical farming and provided a physical base to conduct research into sustainable urban food production. The produce is used to feed the zoo's animals while the project enables evaluation of the systems and provides an educational resource to advocate for change in unsustainable land use practices that impact upon global biodiversity and [[ecosystem services]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgci.org/files/Dublin2010/papers/Frediani-Kevin.pdf|title=Vertical plant production as a public exhibit at Paignton Zoo|publisher= Proceedings of the 4th World Botanic Garden Congress, Botanic Gardens Conservation International|date= June 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
