One dictionary definition is "an overwhelming feeling of reverence, admiration, fear, etc., produced by that which is grand, sublime, extremely powerful, or the like: in awe of God; in awe of great political figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awe zw228

|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/awe |work=Dictionary |publisher=[[Reference.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another dictionary definition is a "mixed emotion of reverence, respect, dread, and wonder inspired by authority, genius, great beauty, sublimity, or might: We felt awe when contemplating the works of Bach. The observers were in awe of the destructive power of the new weapon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awe |url=http://thefreedictionary.com/awe |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com|The Free Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, awe is directed at objects considered to be more powerful than the subject, such as the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the [[Grand Canyon]], the vastness of the cosmos, or [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0q9NMTC8z3IC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pleasure+james+a+russell&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxmtfp3pjXAhUBMJoKHTA2AuEQuwUIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Pleasure|first=James A.|last=Russell|date=30 October 2017|publisher=Psychology Press|accessdate=30 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fpd_NiHlU7QC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=lightning+strike+awe&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjey_bu4JjXAhWDA5oKHeC7D3gQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Preaching Christ from Ecclesiastes: Foundations for Expository Sermons|first=Sidney|last=Greidanus|date=3 May 2010|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|accessdate=30 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Awe is difficult to define, and the meaning of the word has changed over time. Related concepts are [[wonder (emotion)|wonder]], [[admiration]], [[Elevation (psychology)|elevation]], and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. In ''Awe: The Delights and Dangers of Our Eleventh Emotion'', [[Neuropsychology|neuropsychologist]] and positive psychology guru Pearsall presents a phenomenological study of awe. He defines awe as an "overwhelming and bewildering sense of connection with a startling universe that is usually far beyond the narrow band of our consciousness." Pearsall sees awe as the 11th emotion, beyond those now scientifically accepted (i.e., [[love]], [[fear]], [[sadness]], [[embarrassment]], [[curiosity]], [[pride]], [[enjoyment]], [[depression (mood)|despair]], [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], and [[anger]]).”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pearsall, Paul |title=Awe: The Delights and Dangers of Our Eleventh Emotion |publisher=Health Communications, Inc. |year=2007|isbn=0757305857}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most definitions allow for awe to be a positive or a negative experience, but when asked to describe events that elicit awe, most people only cite positive experiences.&lt;ref name="Shiota 2007 944–963"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shiota |first=Michelle |last2=Keltner |first2=Dacher |last3=Mossman |first3=Amanda |year=2007 |title=The nature of awe: Elicitors, appraisals, and effects on self-concept |url= |journal=Cognition and Emotion |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=944–963 |doi=10.1080/02699930600923668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Atlanta Lightning Strike edit1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|This [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] lightning strike might have inspired awe.]]
The term awe stems from the Old English word ''ege'', meaning “terror, dread, awe,” which may have arisen from the Greek word ''áchos'', meaning “pain.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awe etymology |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/awe |publisher=[[Dictionary.com|Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''awesome'' originated from the word ''awe'' in the late 16th century, to mean “filled with awe.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awesome |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/awesome |publisher=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''awful'' also originated from the word ''awe'', to replace the word Old English word ''egeful'' (“dreadful”).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Awful |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/awful |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Evolutionary theories===
'''Awe reinforces social hierarchies'''

Keltner and Haidt&lt;ref name="faculty.virginia.edu"/&gt; proposed an evolutionary explanation for awe. They suggested that the current emotion of awe originated from feelings of ''primordial awe'' – a hard-wired response that low-status individuals felt in the presence of more powerful, high-status individuals, which would have been adaptive by reinforcing social hierarchies. This primordial awe would have only occurred when the high-status person had characteristics of vastness (in size, fame, authority, or prestige) that required the low-status individual to engage in Piagetian [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|accommodation]] (changing one’s mental representation of the world to accommodate the new experience). Keltner and Haidt propose that this primordial awe later generalized to any stimulus that is both vast and that requires accommodation. These stimuli still include being in the presence of a more powerful other (prototypical primordial awe), but also spiritual experiences, grand vistas, natural forces/disasters, human-made works, music, or the experience of understanding a grand scientific theory. Keltner and Haidt propose that awe can have both positive and negative connotations, and that there are five additional features of awe that can color one’s experience of the emotion: [[threat]], [[beauty]], [[:wikt:-ability|ability]], [[virtue]], and the [[supernatural]].

'''Awe is a sexually-selected characteristic'''

Keltner and Haidt’s model has been critiqued by some researchers, including by psychologist Vladimir J. Konečni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Vladimir|last1=Konečni |year=2005 |title=The Aesthetic Trinity: Awe, Being Moved, Thrills. Bulletin of Psychology and the Arts |format=PDF |url=http://konecni.ucsd.edu/pdf/2005%20Aesthetic%20Trinity,%20Bulletin%20of%20P.%20and%20A.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konečni argued that people can only experience awe, especially aesthetic awe (of which, according to him, a "sublime stimulus-in-context" is the principal cause) when they are not in actual physical danger. Konečni postulated that the evolutionary origins of awe are from unexpected encounters with natural wonders, which would have been sexually selected for because [[reverence (attitude)|reverence]], intellectual sensitivity, emotional sensitivity, and elite membership would have been attractive characteristics in a mate, and these characteristics would also have given individuals greater access to awe-inspiring situations. Since high-status people are more likely to be safe from danger and to have access to awe-inspiring situations, Konečni argued that high-status people should feel awe more often than low-status people. However, this hypothesis has yet to be tested and verified.

'''Awe increases systematic processing'''

A third evolutionary theory is that awe serves to draw attention away from the self and toward the environment.&lt;ref name="Shiota 2007 944–963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shiota 2006 61–71"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shiota |first=Michelle |last2=Keltner |first2=Dacher |last3=John |first3=Oliver |year=2006 |title=Positive emotion dispositions differentially associated with Big Five personality and attachment style |url= |journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=61–71 |doi=10.1080/17439760500510833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Griskevicius 2010 190–206"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griskevicius |first=Vladus |last2=Shiota |first2=Michelle |last3=Neufeld |first3=Samantha |year=2010 |title=Influence of different positive emotions on persuasion processing: a functional evolutionary approach |url= |journal=Emotion |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=190–206 |doi=10.1037/a0018421 |pmid=20364895}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs as a way to build informational resources when in the presence of novel and complex stimuli that cannot be assimilated by current knowledge structures. In other words, awe functions to increase systematic, accommodative processing, and this would have been adaptive for survival. This hypothesis is the most recent and has received the most empirical support, as described in the section on [[#Social consequences of awe|social consequences of awe]].

===Non-evolutionary theories===

'''Sundararajan's awe'''

Humanistic/forensic psychologist Louis Sundararajan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Louise|last1=Sundararajan |year=2005 |title=Religious Awe: Potential Contributions of Negative Theology to Psychology, "Positive" or Otherwise |format=PDF |url=http://www.indigenouspsych.org/Members/Sundararajan,%20Louise/Religious%20Awe--Potential%20Contributions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; also critiqued Keltner and Haidt’s model by arguing that being in the presence of a more powerful other elicits admiration, but does not require mental accommodation because admiration merely reinforces existing social hierarchies. Sundararajan expanded upon Keltner and Haidt’s model by arguing that first, an individual must be confronted with perceived vastness. If an individual can [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|assimilate]] this perceived vastness into her or his existing mental categories, s/he will not experience awe. If an individual cannot assimilate the perceived vastness, then s/he will need to [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|accommodate]] to the new information (change her or his mental categories). If this is not accomplished, an individual will experience trauma, such as developing [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]. If an individual can accommodate, s/he will experience awe and wonder. By this model, the same vast experience could lead to increased rigidity (when assimilation succeeds), increased flexibility (when assimilation fails but accommodation succeeds), or psychopathology (when both assimilation and accommodation fail). Sundararajan did not speculate on the evolutionary origins of awe.

==Research==
Despite the meaningfulness that feelings of awe can bring, it has rarely been scientifically studied. As [[Richard Lazarus]] (1994) wrote in his book on emotions, “Given their [awe and wonder’s] importance and emotional power, it is remarkable that so little scientific attention has been paid to aesthetic experience as a source of emotion in our lives” (p.&amp;nbsp;136). Research on awe is in its infancy and has primarily focused on describing awe (e.g., physical displays of awe and who is likely to experience awe) and the social consequences of awe (e.g., helping behavior and susceptibility to persuasion by weak messages).

===Precipitants===
Shiota, Keltner, and Mossman (2007)&lt;ref name="Shiota 2007 944–963"/&gt; had participants write about a time they felt awe and found that nature and art/music were frequently cited as the eliciting stimulus. Although most definitions allow for awe to be positive or negative, participants only described positive precipitants to awe, and it is therefore possible that positive awe and awe+fear (i.e., horror) are distinctly different emotions.

===Emotional experience===
In the same set of experiments by Shiota, Keltner, and Mossman (2007),&lt;ref name="Shiota 2007 944–963"/&gt; the researchers had participants write about a time they recently experienced natural beauty (awe condition) or accomplishment (pride condition). When describing the experience of natural beauty, participants were more likely to report that they felt unaware of day-to-day concerns, felt the presence of something greater, didn't want the experience to end, felt connected with the world, and felt small or insignificant. 

It is not yet known whether awe is experienced differently in different cultures{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

===Physical displays===
Researchers have also attempted to observe the physical, non-verbal reactions to awe by asking participants to remember a time they felt awe and to express the emotion nonverbally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shiota |first=Michelle |last2=Campos |first2=Belinda |last3=Keltner |first3=Dacher |year=2003 |title=The Faces of Positive Emotion: Prototype Displays of Awe, Amusement, and Pride |url= |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1000 |issue=1 |pages=296–299 |doi=10.1196/annals.1280.029}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this method, researchers observed that awe is often displayed through raised inner eyebrows (78%), widened eyes (61%), and open, slightly drop-jawed mouths (80%). A substantial percent of people also display awe by slightly jutting forward their head (27%) and visibly inhaling (27%), but smiling is uncommon (10%). Cross-cultural research is needed to determine whether physical displays of awe differ by culture.

===Personality and awe===
Some individuals may be more prone to experiencing awe. Using self- and peer-reports, researchers&lt;ref name="Shiota 2006 61–71"/&gt; found that regularly experiencing awe was associated with openness to experience (self and peer-ratings) and extroversion (self-ratings). Later studies&lt;ref name="Shiota 2007 944–963"/&gt; also found that people who regularly experience awe ("awe-prone") have lower need for cognitive closure and are more likely to describe themselves in oceanic (e.g. "I am an inhabitant of the planet Earth"), individuated, and universal terms, as opposed to more specific terms (e.g. "I have blonde hair").

===Social consequences===
A more recent study found that experiencing awe increased perceptions of time and led to a greater willingness to donate time, but not to donate money.&lt;ref name="Rudd 2012 1130–1136"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudd |first=Melanie |last2=Vohs |first2=Kathleen |last3=Aaker |first3=Jennifer |year=2012 |title=Awe expands people's perception of time, alters decision making, and enhances well-being |url= |journal=Psychological Science |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=1130–1136 |doi=10.1177/0956797612438731 |pmid=22886132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greater willingness to donate time appeared to be driven by decreased impatience after experiencing awe. Experiencing awe also led participants to report greater momentary life satisfaction and stronger preferences for experiential versus material goods (e.g. prefer a massage to a watch).&lt;ref name="Rudd 2012 1130–1136"/&gt; Awe, unlike most other positive emotions, has been shown to increase [[Heuristic-systematic model of information processing|systematic processing]], rather than [[Heuristic-systematic model of information processing|heuristic processing]], leading participants who experience awe to become less susceptible to weak arguments.&lt;ref name="Griskevicius 2010 190–206"/&gt;

==Awe and atheism==
Awe has recently become a topic of interest in atheist groups, in response to statements from some religious individuals who say that atheists do not experience awe, or that experiencing awe makes one spiritual or religious, rather than an atheist. For example, see Oprah's comment that she would not consider swimmer [[Diana Nyad]] an atheist because Nyad experiences awe, as well as the response to this video by interfaith activist [[Chris Stedman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stedman |first=Chris |title=What Oprah gets wrong about atheism |publisher=CNN Belief Blog |url=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2013/10/16/what-oprah-gets-wrong-about-atheism/ |date=October 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awe is often tied to religion, but awe can also be secular. For more examples, see the writings on being an "aweist"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aweism |url=http://www.atheistnexus.org/profiles/blogs/aweism-1 |publisher=Atheist Nexus |date=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; by sociologist and atheist Phil Zuckerman, the book ''[[Religion for Atheists]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de Botton |first=Alain |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qf3eWWmWFsQC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Religion for Atheists |publisher=Penguin UK |isbn=9780141937601}}&lt;/ref&gt; by author [[Alain de Botton]], and the video on how secular institutions should inspire awe by performance philosopher [[Jason Silva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Silva |first=Jason |title=How can secular institutions inspire the same awe of religious ones? |url=http://itsabeautifulearth.com/2013/08/20/how-can-secular-institutions-inspire-the-same-awe-of-religious-ones/ |publisher=The S.P.A.C.E.

[[File:Sphere wireframe.svg|thumb|In [[Euclidean space]], a '''ball''' is the volume bounded by a sphere]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''ball''' is the space bounded by a [[sphere]]. It may be a '''closed ball''' (including the [[boundary points]] that constitute the sphere) or an '''open ball''' (excluding them).

These concepts are defined not only in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] but also for lower and higher dimensions, and for [[metric space]]s in general. A ''ball'' or '''hyperball''' in {{mvar|n}} dimensions is called an '''{{mvar|n}}-ball''' and is bounded by an [[N-sphere|'''({{math|''n'' − 1}})-sphere''']]. Thus, for example, a ball in the [[Euclidean plane]] is the same thing as a [[disk (mathematics)|disk]], the area bounded by a [[circle]]. In [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 3-space]], a ball is taken to be the [[volume]] bounded by a [[2-sphere|2-dimensional sphere]]. In a [[one-dimensional space]], a ball is a [[line segment]].

In other contexts, such as in [[Euclidean geometry]] and informal use, ''sphere'' is sometimes used to mean ''ball''.

==Balls in Euclidean space==
In Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space, an (open) {{mvar|n}}-ball of radius {{mvar|r}} and center {{mvar|x}} is the set of all points of distance less than {{mvar|r}} from {{mvar|x}}. A closed {{mvar|n}}-ball of radius {{mvar|r}} is the set of all points of distance less than or equal to {{mvar|r}} away from {{mvar|x}}.

In Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space, every ball is bounded by a [[hypersphere]].  The ball is a bounded [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] when {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}, is a '''[[Disk (mathematics)|disk]]''' bounded by a [[circle]] when {{math|1=''n'' = 2}}, and is bounded by a [[sphere]] when {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}.

=== Volume ===
{{main article|Volume of an n-ball|l1=Volume of an {{mvar|n}}-ball}}
The {{mvar|n}}-dimensional volume of a Euclidean ball of radius {{mvar|R}} in {{mvar|n}}-dimensional Euclidean space is:&lt;ref&gt;Equation 5.19.4, ''NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions.'' http://dlmf.nist.gov/,{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Release 1.0.6 of 2013-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_n(R) = \frac{\pi^\frac{n}{2}}{\Gamma\left(\frac{n}{2} + 1\right)}R^n,&lt;/math&gt;
where&amp;nbsp;{{math|Γ}} is [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[gamma function]] (which can be thought of as an extension of the [[factorial]] function to fractional arguments). Using explicit formulas for [[particular values of the gamma function]] at the integers and half integers gives formulas for the volume of a Euclidean ball that do not require an evaluation of the gamma function. These are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}V_{2k}(R) &amp;= \frac{\pi^k}{k!}R^{2k}\,,\\
V_{2k+1}(R) &amp;= \frac{2^{k+1}\pi^k}{(2k+1)!!}R^{2k+1} = \frac{2(k!)(4\pi)^k}{(2k+1)!}R^{2k+1}\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
In the formula for odd-dimensional volumes, the [[double factorial]] {{math|(2''k'' + 1)!!}} is defined for odd integers {{math|2''k'' + 1}} as {{math|1=(2''k'' + 1)!! = 1 · 3 · 5 · … · (2''k'' − 1) · (2''k'' + 1)}}.

==Balls in general metric spaces==
Let {{math|(''M'', ''d'')}} be a [[metric space]], namely a set {{mvar|M}} with a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] (distance function) {{mvar|d}}. The open (metric) '''ball of radius''' {{math|''r'' &gt; 0}} centered at a point {{mvar|p}} in {{mvar|M}}, usually denoted by {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'')}} or {{math|''B''(''p''; ''r'')}}, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;B_r(p) = \{ x \in M \mid d(x,p) &lt; r \},&lt;/math&gt;

The closed (metric) ball, which may be denoted by {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''[''p'']}} or {{math|''B''[''p''; ''r'']}}, is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;B_r[p] = \{ x \in M \mid d(x,p) \le r \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note in particular that a ball (open or closed) always includes {{mvar|p}} itself, since the definition requires {{math|''r'' &gt; 0}}.

The [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of the open ball {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'')}} is usually denoted {{math|{{overline|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'')}}}}. While it is always the case that {{math|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'') ⊆ {{overline|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'')}} ⊆ ''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''[''p'']}}, it is {{em|not}} always the case that {{math|{{overline|''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''(''p'')}} {{=}} ''B&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''[''p'']}}. For example, in a metric space {{mvar|X}} with the [[discrete metric]], one has {{math|{{overline|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''p'')}} {{=}} {p&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} and {{math|''B''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[''p''] {{=}} ''X''}}, for any {{math|''p'' ∈ ''X''}}.

A '''[[unit ball]]''' (open or closed) is a ball of radius 1.

A subset of a metric space is [[bounded set|bounded]] if it is contained in some ball. A set is [[totally bounded]] if, given any positive radius, it is covered by finitely many balls of that radius.

The open balls of a [[metric space]] can serve as a [[base (topology)|base]], giving this space a [[topological space|topology]], the open sets of which are all possible [[union (set theory)|union]]s of open balls. This topology on a metric space is called the '''topology induced by''' the metric {{mvar|d}}.

==Balls in normed vector spaces==
Any [[normed vector space]] {{mvar|V}} with norm &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|&lt;/math&gt; is also a metric space with the metric &lt;math&gt;d (x,y)= \|x-y\|.&lt;/math&gt;  In such spaces, an arbitrary ball &lt;math&gt;B_r(y)&lt;/math&gt; of points &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; around a point &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; with a distance of less than &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; may be viewed as a scaled (by &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;) and translated (by &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;) copy of a ''unit ball'' &lt;math&gt;B_1(0).&lt;/math&gt; Such "centered" balls with &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; are denoted with &lt;math&gt;B(r).&lt;/math&gt;

The Euclidean balls discussed earlier are an example of balls in a normed vector space.

==={{mvar|p}}-norm===
In a [[Cartesian space]] {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} with the [[p-norm|{{mvar|p}}-norm]] {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}}, that is

:&lt;math&gt;\left\| x \right\| _p = \left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \dotsb + |x_n|^p \right) ^{1/p},&lt;/math&gt;

an open ball around the origin with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is given by the set

:&lt;math&gt; B(r) = \left\{ x \in \R^n \,:\left\| x \right\| _p = \left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \dotsb + |x_n|^p \right) ^{1/p} &lt; r \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

For {{math|1=''n'' = 2}}, in a 2-dimensional plane &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^2&lt;/math&gt;, "balls" according to the {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}-norm (often called the ''[[Taxicab geometry|taxicab]]'' or ''Manhattan'' metric) are bounded by squares with their ''diagonals'' parallel to the coordinate axes; those according to the {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}}-norm, also called the [[Chebyshev distance|Chebyshev]] metric, have squares with their ''sides'' parallel to the coordinate axes as their boundaries. The {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}-norm, known as the Euclidean metric, generates the well known discs within circles, and for other values of {{mvar|p}}, the corresponding balls are areas bounded by [[Lamé curve]]s (hypoellipses or hyperellipses).

For {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}, the {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}- balls are within octahedra with axes-aligned ''body diagonals'', the {{math|''L''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;}}-balls are within cubes with axes-aligned ''edges'', and the boundaries of balls for {{mvar|L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;}} with {{math|''p'' &gt; 2}} are [[superegg|superellipsoids]]. Obviously, {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} generates the inner of usual spheres.

===General convex norm===
More generally, given any [[central symmetry|centrally symmetric]], [[bounded set|bounded]], [[open set|open]], and [[convex set|convex]] subset {{mvar|X}} of {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, one can define a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] on {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} where the balls are all translated and uniformly scaled copies of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|X}}. Note this theorem does not hold if "open" subset is replaced by "closed" subset, because the origin point qualifies but does not define a norm on&amp;nbsp;{{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

==Topological balls==

One may talk about balls in any [[topological space]] {{mvar|X}}, not necessarily induced by a metric. An (open or closed) {{mvar|n}}-dimensional '''topological ball''' of {{mvar|X}} is any subset of {{mvar|X}} which is [[homeomorphic]] to an (open or closed) Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-ball. Topological {{mvar|n}}-balls are important in [[combinatorial topology]], as the building blocks of [[cell complex]]es.

Any open topological {{mvar|n}}-ball is homeomorphic to the Cartesian space {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and to the open [[hypercube|unit {{mvar|n}}-cube]] (hypercube) {{math|(0, 1)&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ⊆ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Any closed topological {{mvar|n}}-ball is homeomorphic to the closed {{mvar|n}}-cube {{math|[0, 1]&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}.

An {{mvar|n}}-ball is homeomorphic to an {{mvar|m}}-ball if and only if {{math|1=''n'' = ''m''}}. The homeomorphisms between an open {{mvar|n}}-ball {{mvar|B}} and {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be classified in two classes, that can be identified with the two possible [[orientation (mathematics)|topological orientation]]s of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|B}}.

A topological {{mvar|n}}-ball need not be [[differentiable manifold|smooth]]; if it is smooth, it need not be [[diffeomorphic]] to a Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-ball.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9127">The '''bias blind spot''' is the [[cognitive bias]] of recognizing the impact of biases on the judgment of others, while failing to see the impact of biases on one's own judgment.&lt;ref name=Pronin2002&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0146167202286008|title=The Bias Blind Spot: Perceptions of Bias in Self Versus Others|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=28|issue=3|pages=369–381|year=2002|last1=Pronin|first1=E.|last2=Lin|first2=D. Y.|last3=Ross|first3=L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was created by Emily Pronin, a social psychologist from [[Princeton University]]'s [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]], with colleagues Daniel Lin and [[Lee Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110723153707/http://cbdr.cmu.edu/event.asp?eventID=15 Emily Pronin, Center for Behavioral Decision Research]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=June 2016}} The bias blind spot is named after the visual [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]. Most people appear to exhibit the bias blind spot. In a sample of more than 600 residents of the United States, more than 85% believed they were less biased than the average American. Only one participant believed that he or she was more biased than the average American. People do vary with regard to the extent to which they exhibit the bias blind spot. It appears to be a stable individual difference that is measurable (for a scale, see Scopelliti et al. 2015).&lt;ref name="Scopelliti2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bias Blind Spot: Structure, Measurement, and Consequences |journal=[[Management Science (journal)|Management Science]] |volume = 61|issue = 10|pages = 2468–2486|date = 2015|doi = 10.1287/mnsc.2014.2096|language = en|first = Irene|last = Scopelliti|first2 = Carey K.|last2 = Morewedge|first3 = Erin|last3 = McCormick|first4 = H. Lauren|last4 = Min|first5 = Sophie|last5 = Lebrecht|first6 = Karim S.|last6 = Kassam|url=http://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mnsc.2014.2096}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bias blind spot appears to be a true blind spot in that it is unrelated to actual [[Decision-making|decision making]] ability. Performance on indices of decision making competence are not related to individual differences in bias blind spot. In other words, everyone seems to think they are less biased than other people, regardless of their actual decision making ability.&lt;ref name="Scopelliti2015" /&gt;

==Causes==
Bias blind spots may be caused by a variety of other biases and self-deceptions.&lt;ref name=page&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Page|first1=Antony|title=Unconscious Bias and the Limits of Director Independence|journal=University of Illinois Law Review|date=2009|volume=2009|issue=1|pages=237–294|url=https://illinoislawreview.org/article/unconscious-bias-and-the-limits-of-director-independence/|issn=0276-9948|SSRN=1392625|access-date=2016-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625122910/https://illinoislawreview.org/article/unconscious-bias-and-the-limits-of-director-independence/|archive-date=2016-06-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-enhancement biases may play a role, in that people are motivated to view themselves in a positive light. Biases are generally seen as undesirable,&lt;ref name=Pronin2007&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001|pmid=17129749|title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37–43|year=2007|last1=Pronin|first1=Emily}}&lt;/ref&gt; so people tend to think of their own perceptions and judgments as being rational, accurate, and free of bias. The self-enhancement bias also applies when analyzing our own decisions, in that people are likely to think of themselves as better decision makers than others.&lt;ref name="page" /&gt;

People also tend to believe they are aware of "how" and "why" they make their decisions, and therefore conclude that bias did not play a role. Many of our decisions are formed from biases and cognitive shortcuts, which are unconscious processes. By definition, people are unaware of [[Unconscious cognition|unconscious processes]], and therefore cannot see their influence in the decision making process.&lt;ref name="page" /&gt;

When made aware of various biases acting on our perception, decisions, or judgments, research has shown that we are still unable to control them. This contributes to the bias blind spot in that even if one is told that they are biased, they are unable to alter their biased perception.&lt;ref name="page" /&gt;

==Role of introspection==
Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler have argued that this phenomenon is due to the [[introspection illusion]].&lt;ref name="gilovich"/&gt; In their experiments, subjects had to make judgments about themselves and about other subjects.&lt;ref name="blindspot"&gt;{{cite journal |date= 2007 |title=Valuing thoughts, ignoring behavior: The introspection illusion as a source of the bias blind spot |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]] |publisher=Elsevier |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=565–578 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.011|last1=Pronin |first1=Emily |last2=Kugler |first2=Matthew B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They displayed standard biases, for example rating themselves above the others on desirable qualities (demonstrating [[illusory superiority]]). The experimenters explained cognitive bias, and asked the subjects how it might have affected their judgment. The subjects rated themselves as less susceptible to bias than others in the experiment (confirming the bias blind spot). When they had to explain their judgments, they used different strategies for assessing their own and others' bias.

Pronin and Kugler's interpretation is that, when people decide whether someone else is biased, they use overt behaviour. On the other hand, when assessing whether they themselves are biased, people [[Introspection|look inward]], searching their own thoughts and feelings for biased motives.&lt;ref name="gilovich"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilovich |first=Thomas |author2=Nicholas Epley|author3=Karlene Hanko |title=The Self in Social Judgment |editor=Mark D. Alicke |editor2=David A. Dunning |editor3=Joachim I. Krueger |publisher=[[Psychology Press]] |location=New York |year=2005 |series=Studies in Self and Identity |page=77 |chapter=Shallow Thoughts About the Self: The Automatic Components of Self-Assessment |isbn=978-1-84169-418-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since biases operate [[unconsciously]], these [[introspection]]s are not informative, but people wrongly treat them as reliable indication that they themselves, unlike other people, are immune to bias.&lt;ref name="blindspot"/&gt;

Pronin and Kugler tried to give their subjects access to others' introspections. To do this, they made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they decided whether their answer to a previous question might have been affected by bias.&lt;ref name="blindspot"/&gt; Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers.

==Differences of perceptions==
People tend to attribute bias in an uneven way. When people reach different perceptions, they tend to label one another as biased while labelling themselves as accurate and unbiased. Pronin hypothesizes that this bias misattribution may be a source of conflict and misunderstanding between people. For example, in labeling another person as biased, one may also label their intentions cynically. But when examining one's own cognitions, people judge themselves based on their good intentions. It is likely that in this case, one may attribute another's bias to "intentional malice" rather than an unconscious process.&lt;ref name="Pronin2008"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1154199|pmid=18511681|title=How We See Ourselves and How We See Others|journal=Science|volume=320|issue=5880|pages=1177–1180|year=2008|last1=Pronin|first1=E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pronin also hypothesizes ways to use awareness of the bias blind spot to reduce conflict, and to think in a more "scientifically informed" way. Although we are unable to control bias on our own cognitions,&lt;ref name="page" /&gt; one may keep in mind that biases are acting on everyone. Pronin suggests that people might use this knowledge to separate other's intentions from their actions.&lt;ref name="Pronin2008" /&gt;

== Relation to actual commission of bias ==
Initial evidence suggests that the bias blind spot is not related to actual decision-making ability.&lt;ref name="Scopelliti2015" /&gt; Participants who scored better or poorer on various tasks associated with decision making competence were no more or less likely to be higher or lower in their susceptibility to bias blind spot. Bias blind spot does, however, appear to increase susceptibility to related biases. People who are high in bias blind spot are more likely to ignore the advice of other people, and are less likely to benefit from training geared to reduce their commission of other biases.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4073">'''Black United Front''' also known as '''The Black United Front of Nova Scotia''' or simply '''BUF''' was a [[Black Nationalism|Black nationalist]] organization primarily  based in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the United States.  Preceded by the [[Nova Scotia Association for the Advancement of Coloured People]] (NSAACP), the BUF organization was founded by Dr. [[William Pearly Oliver]] and [[Burnley "Rocky" Jones]] among others.  It was founded in 1965 and loosely based on the 10 point program of the [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ourroots.ca/page.aspx?id=3622336&amp;qryID=7d0c6d07-1aaa-4912-b003-0d1a2dfc095e&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, [[Stokely Carmichael]], popular for coining the phrase ''Black Power!'', visited [[Nova Scotia]] helping organize the BUF.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mail-archive.com/sixties-l@googlegroups.com/msg01230.html&lt;/ref&gt; The organization remained in operation until 1996.

The Black United Front did a lot to benefit the [[Black Nova Scotians|Black Nova Scotian]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofrights.com/ngo/nova_scotia.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711171942/http://www.historyofrights.com/ngo/nova_scotia.html |archivedate=2011-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization held 
discussions about employment, housing and educational opportunities. The group also formed its own [[Community policing|community police force]] to keep hard drugs out of Halifax communities, prevent [[police brutality]] in communities of colour, and built a park for young children called the ''Tot-Lot''. Additionally, they provided [[legal aid]] in the forms of free legal advice and discounted, even sometimes free legal service to the [[Black Canadians|Black community]]. The Black United Front reportedly "Shook up whites in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themarknews.com/articles/1530-malcolm-x-day-in-canada |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716065644/http://www.themarknews.com/articles/1530-malcolm-x-day-in-canada |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Members ==
*[[Burnley "Rocky" Jones]]
*[[Yvonne Atwell]] was once a member of the BUF, and for many years served as president of the Black United Front.
*[[Buddy Daye]]

==The Ten Point Program==
The Ten Point Program was as follows: &lt;/li&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackpanther.org/foundation.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ol start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We want freedom. We want to be able to control the destiny of Black and oppressed communities. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We want full employment for our people. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We want an end to the robbery by the capitalists, of our black and oppressed communities. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We want decent housing, fit for the shelter of human beings. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We want decent education for '''all''' people and an education that teaches us our true history and role in present society. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We want our community to be healthy and for them use to their advantage, the free health care in this nation. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We want an immediate end to police brutality and murder of Black people, other people of color, and all oppressed people in this nation. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We want an immediate end to all wars. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We want adequate rights for all Black and oppressed people held in federal, provincial, county, municipal prisons and jails.  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;We want land, bread, housing, education, clothing, justice and peace. &lt;/li&gt;

The '''Bonville–Courtenay feud''' of 1455 engendered a series of raids, sieges, and attacks between two major [[Devon]] families, the [[House of Courtenay#The English House of Courtenay|Courtenays]] and the [[Baron Bonville|Bonvilles]], in [[south west England]], in the mid-fifteenth century. One of many such aristocratic feuds of the time, it became entwined with national politics due to the political weight of the protagonists. The Courtenay [[Earl of Devon|earls of Devon]] were the traditional powerbrokers in the region, but by this time a local baronial family, the Bonvilles, had become more powerful and rivalled the Courtenays for royal patronage. Eventually this rivalry spilled over into physical violence, including social disorder, murder and siege.

The Bonville-Courtenay feud is often given as an example of the degree to which law and order and respect for the king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often considered it a cause of the later [[Wars of the Roses]]; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud is perhaps most well known for culminating in an armed encounter at [[Clyst Heath|Clyst]] (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near [[Exeter]], which resulted in loss of life.

The events at Clyst  resulted in government intervention in the politics of the west country. This was unusual, as the government did not have a good track-record of settling local disputes among the nobility. However, it is likely that this was done for reasons of higher politics; [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville|William Bonville]] was by 1455 a Yorkist, and [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] had been made [[Lord Protector]]. Although in the short term it resulted in [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Thomas de Courtenay, Earl of Devon]]'s incarceration, the Bonville–Courtenay feud did not come to an effective end until the protagonists were all killed in the early years of the civil wars.

The mid-fifteenth century suffered greatly from the private [[feud]]s of the [[nobility]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]] in general. Devonshire, whilst experiencing none of the pitched battles, was still ravaged by a private feud.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 252&lt;/ref&gt; This was between [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon]], whose family had been [[Earl of Devon|earls of that county]] since 1335&lt;ref&gt;Cokayne, G.E. &amp; Gibbs, V.,(ed.), ''The Complete Peerage of Great Britain and Ireland'', 16 vols, rev. (London, 1916), 323&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]]. Their feud became inextricably tied to the national political scene, but originated in regional Devon society. In 2003, [[historian]] Martin Cherry agreed that the south west was to a great degree lawless at this time. However, he suggested that the Bonville-Courtenay feud, whilst being the best-known, is not the sole example of political upheaval in the region, which was common throughout the century.&lt;ref&gt;Kleineke, H., 'Why the West was Wild: Law and Disorder in Fifteenth-Century Cornwall and Devon', in: Clark, L.S., (ed.), ''The Fifteenth Century III: Authority and Subversion'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, historian [[R. L. Storey]] suggested that the [[civil war]]s which racked England for much of the fifteenth century had their origins in the breakdown of both the king's ability to govern, and law and order in the localities, and gave the Courtenay-Bonville feud as one such example.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 165–76.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], had been incapacitated by mental illness in August 1453.&lt;ref name="Wagner2001"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubXnWRMt6uoC&amp;pg=PA113|title=Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2001|isbn=978-1-85109-358-8|pages=113–|author=John A. Wagner}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the recall to court of the recalcitrant [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], his closest adult relative and a potential claimant to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23503|title=Richard of York|website=www.oxforddnb.com|access-date=2017-03-18}} {{subscription required }}&lt;/ref&gt; York had been banished to his estates after a failed rebellion in 1452. The following year, with the king still incapacitated, York was appointed [[Lord Protector]] and First Councillor of the realm, for the duration of the king's illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12953|title=Henry VI|website=www.oxforddnb.com|publisher=}} Retrieved 2017-03-18{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used this position to move against his chief rival, the hitherto dominant [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]], who was imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1855|title=Edmund Beaufort|website=www.oxforddnb.com|access-date=2017-03-18}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Christmas of 1454, King Henry had recovered from his illness, removing the basis for York's authority.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry and a select council of nobles decided to hold a great council at [[Leicester]]. York and his closest allies, his brother-in-law [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury]] and Salisbury's son [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Richard, Earl of Warwick]], anticipated that charges might be brought against them at this assembly. They gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching Leicester, intercepting them at [[St Albans]]. Both militarily and politically it was a complete victory for York and the Nevilles. On 22 May 1455, at the [[First Battle of St Albans]] they captured the king and retook their places in government, while York's and the Nevilles' rivals, the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]], the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]] were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, A., ''The Wars of the Roses: Military Activity and English Society, 1452–97'', (London, 1981), 24&lt;/ref&gt; Among the royalists wounded were the [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] and Somerset's son the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Earl of Dorset]], the [[Thomas de Courtenay, 5th/13th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], and the king's half-brother [[Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford|Jasper Tudor, Earl of Pembroke]].&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 110.&lt;/ref&gt; York was appointed Protector of England, for the second time, by parliament a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale, 2010), 114&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor [[Ralph A. Griffiths]] places the fault for the feud between the Courtenays and Bonvilles firmly in the lap of King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], through whose "thoughtless liberality and government carelessness&amp;nbsp;... personal jealousies in the [[west country]] had been exacerbated."&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 577&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recently, Martin Cherry warned against seeing the feud as the same as the later civil wars writ small; they were, he says, "qualitatively" different, resulting in the ultimate disintegration of the earl's affinity, rather than symptomatic of his violence.&lt;ref&gt;Kleineke, H., 'Why the West was Wild: Law and Disorder in Fifteenth-Century Cornwall and Devon', in: Clark, L.S., (ed.), ''The Fifteenth Century III: Authority and Subversion'' (Woodbridge, 2003), 77&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] has pointed out that although there were many other regional feuds at this time (including the [[John Talbot, 1st Viscount Lisle#Aggressive acquisition|Lisle]]-[[Berkeley family|Berkeley]] dispute, also waged in the west country), they did not have the same causes, or were necessarily caused by weak government at all: for instance, whereas the Bonville–Courtenay feud had territorial domination at its root, others, such as the Berkeley–Lisle dispute, were begun over contested [[inheritance]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., ''The Wars of the Roses'' (Totton, 2012), 96&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry has also suggested that the main cause of the Bonville–Courtenay dispute was the desperation of the earl to "gain access to crown patronage for himself and his clients" – something he was gradually failing to do in the face of competition.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 123–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local politics===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Sir William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville, KG.png|thumb|Coat of Arms of Sir William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville]]
As noted, the feud between the Bonvilles and Courtenays was rooted in local Devonshire politics. The rivalry between them stemmed from the fact that they were major [[estate (land)|estate]] holders in the south west, and further, because both had claims to crown patronage. For example, William Bonville had fought in the [[Hundred Years' War]] for both Henry VI and his father, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], whilst Devon through his wife was the king's cousin.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1912"&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 253&lt;/ref&gt; Although the earl was both the greatest landowner and the highest ranking nobleman in the county, he had in recent years seen members of the lesser gentry and nobility (such as William Bonville) receive advancement in his stead.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 574&lt;/ref&gt; Bonville had also furthered his own advancement by successively marrying into the lower nobility (a daughter of the [[Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn|Lord Grey of Ruthin]]) and then to an aunt of the Earl of Devon himself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1981"/&gt; The main royal office in the area –  and therefore the main source of royal patronage –  was the stewardship of the highly profitable [[Duchy of Cornwall]]. Both men had held the office alternately over recent years. Tensions between the two have been traced back to 1437, when the stewardship was taken from Courtenay and granted to William Bonville. Courtenay did receive a royal grant of £100 ''per annum'' [[life annuity]] at this time. But, says Griffiths, this is unlikely to have made up for loss of the main royal office in the county.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 574–5&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly, within two years, severe attacks were being launched on Bonville's property, and by 1440, relations between the two were, Griffiths says, "at breaking point." This tension became apparent in open manifestations of military strength; manifestations worrying enough to government to lead to them both being summoned before council.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 575&lt;/ref&gt; In 1441 the stewardship was returned to the Earl of Devon, although Radford questions whether Bonville actually ever physically surrendered the office, as in November that year an [[arbitration]] took place between them to "end all [of their] differences."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1912"/&gt;

There followed a four-year period of peace; but this could simply be accounted for by the fact that Bonville spent that time in service in [[Gascony]], which, it has been suggested, may have been one of the conditions of the arbitration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; It was, though, only a temporary peace for the region as by 1449 the earl besieged Bonville (now promoted to the [[baronage]] in recognition of his success in France)&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 576&lt;/ref&gt; in his castle of [[Taunton Castle|Taunton]] for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 254&lt;/ref&gt; Courtenay supported [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]] in his 1452 rebellion at [[Dartford]], even joining him in the field against the king. This [[treason]] resulted in him forfeiting his royal offices in the south west, including not only the stewardship of the duchy – which was finally granted to Bonville for life – but [[Lydford Castle]], the [[Forest of Dartmoor]], and the [[River Exe|Water of Exe]].&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 255&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, as his ally the duke was eclipsed in government, Courtenay was eclipsed by Bonville in the south west. Courtenay had –  in imitation of his ally –  waged a local war against Bonville and Bonville's ally, the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]], between 1451–5. Raising an army of 5–6,000 men, he forced Wiltshire to desert his manor of Lackham, and then returned to the siege of Taunton. The siege was only lifted when the Duke of York arrived unannounced three days later, and took the castle into his own hands, forcing a peace upon the two parties.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

Bonville had, then, by April 1455, received much royal favour, including all the offices the earl had lost, as well as the constableship of [[Rougemont Castle|Exeter Castle]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 165&lt;/ref&gt; He was –  as one historian has called him –  "the King's lieutenant in the west." The Earl of Devon had already reacted against this hegemony during the Duke of York's first protectorate (1454–5) and joined the [[Curia regis|royal council]]. However, it appears that even the council itself did not trust him to keep the [[Queen's peace|King's peace]], as they placed him under a bond of £1,000 to do so. This he had disregarded,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1966"/&gt; and commenced another campaign against Bonville. This time, the Earl of Devon was accompanied by his sons, and, bringing a force of men into [[Exeter]] in April 1455, he attempted to ambush Bonville. This resulted in further government-imposed undertakings of good behaviour between the two parties. As the government was now headed by Courtenay's old ally, the Duke of York, it is likely that it was now that the earl decided to reject his alliance with York and give his support to the crown. He fought (and was wounded) at [[First Battle of St Albans|St Albans]] on 22 May that year, on the side of the king.&lt;ref&gt;Roskell, J.S., ''The Commons in the Parliament of 1422'' (Manchester, 1954), 155.&lt;/ref&gt; Bonville, meanwhile, through his wife, was related to the Harrington family of [[Hornby-with-Farleton|Hornby]], [[Lancashire]], who had close links to the [[House of Neville|Nevilles]] –  his father-in-law was [[Thomas Harrington (knight)|Thomas Harrington]], a [[feoffee]] and [[Bastard feudalism|retainer]] to the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]]. Bonville's new-found [[House of York|Yorkist]] sympathies seem to have driven the Earl of Devon to even greater violence in the county.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==The murder of Nicholas Radford==
[[File:Tower, Exeter castle (geograph 3468003).jpg|thumb|left|Tower at Exeter castle]]
From October 1455, Devon and his sons were committing acts of social disorder, seemingly intending to disrupt the administrative machinery of the county (of which Bonville, of course, was a part), for instance by preventing the local [[Justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] from holding quarterly sessions by force; they then proceeded to raise a small army at [[Tiverton, Devon|Tiverton]] under the leadership of Devon's eldest son, [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Thomas Courtenay]]. It was this force that was to be guilty of what [[R. L. Storey]] has called "the most notorious private crime of the century," due not only to the violence involved but the fact that it was "so obviously premeditated."&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 167&lt;/ref&gt; This force made its way to [[Upcott, Cheriton Fitzpaine|Upcott]] on 23 October 1455, the home of [[Nicholas Radford]], a close associate and legal advisor to Bonville, and a respected member of the community who had previously been [[Recorder (judge)|recorder]] of the city of Exeter and [[member of parliament]]. Storey has suggested that being an experienced lawyer, he was most probably targeted by Devon and his sons for the very reason that he had aided Bonville's escape from Devon's litigation in the past;&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 168&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 1455 he had [[enfeoffed]] Bonville (and others) for land valued at £400.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Courtenay's force attacked Radford's manor that night; they set fire to the wall and gates to draw him out. On their word, including Courtenay's solemn promise to do him no harm if he would speak with them, Radford let them in – although apparently he commented upon their large number. Whilst Radford and Devon's son drank wine, the latter's followers "ransacked"&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; Radford's house, stealing goods up to the value of 1,000 [[Mark (currency)|marks]], including all his horses and the sheets off his [[Patient|invalid]] wife's bed.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Storey, R. L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 169&lt;/ref&gt; On a pretext of meeting his father the earl, Courtenay persuaded Radford to accompany him when his force withdrew; however, he abandoned Radford on the road a short distance from the house, and six of Courtenay's men killed him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; Devon subsequently dispatched a force to the [[chapel]] where Radford's body was; they performed, says Storey, a "mock inquest, one of them acting as coroner and others, with assumed names, as jurors. They brought in a verdict of [[suicide]]."&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt; They then forced Radford's servants to convey his corpse as if he had been a [[Heresy|heretic]] to the graveyard, where it was deposited unceremoniously into an open grave; the stones laid ready to build his memorial were then dropped on the body, crushing it. By making recognition of the body impossible, this prevented an official [[inquest]] being held into Radford's death.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"/&gt;

==Following the murder==
The murder of Nicholas Radford, says R. L. Storey, was only "the curtain raiser" for further military activities. Devon proceeded to raise a force and occupy Exeter – "as if they were the city's lawful garrison" – until just before Christmas, seizing the [[Freedom of the City|keys of the city]];&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 257&lt;/ref&gt; various houses in the city belonging to Bonville and his supporters were ransacked, and members of the [[Exeter Cathedral|Cathedral]] were arrested and forced to buy their freedom. In one case, a man was bodily removed from the choir whilst celebrating [[Mass (Catholic Church)|Mass]]. Both Bonville and Courtenay had 'extensive relations' with the Cathedral, dating back to the 1430s, but the Courtenays had greatly contributed to its expansion in the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Attreed, L., 'Arbitration and the Growth of Urban Liberties in Late Medieval England', Journal of British Studies, 31 (1992), 227–8&lt;/ref&gt; Their actions in 1455 were probably inspired by the fact that Radford had entrusted much of his wealth to the safe-keeping of the church, and Devon saw an opportunity to enrich himself; possibly, says Storey, he was forced to take such action to be able to pay his men.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 170&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Cherry has pointed to the lack of references to any martial expenses on the earl's behalf in the extant accounts, as indicating that his campaign effectively paid for itself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"/&gt; During the same period, Devon, "in warlike fashion and like an insurrection"&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; also besieged [[Powderham Castle]], which belonged to his distant cousin and Bonville ally, Sir [[Philip Courtenay (died 1463)|Philip Courtenay]]; the latter resisted, and Bonville came to his assistance. Prior to doing this, however, he raided the Earl of Devon's house at [[Colcombe Castle]] and proceeded to ransack it. Bonville attempted to lift the siege at Powderham on 19 November, but was repulsed by Devon, and lost two men in the fight,&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 171&lt;/ref&gt; which may have involved up to a thousand men.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 258&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Devon continued his attempts to persuade the city of Exeter to raise a force on his behalf – which they refused to do – before leaving Exeter on 15 December,&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"/&gt; as Bonville approached, on his way to Powderham. The two forces met at Clyst, just south west of Exeter.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, G.H., 'The Fight at Clyst in 1455', ''The Devonshire Association'', 44 (1912), 260&lt;/ref&gt;

==The fight at Clyst==
[[File:MapBattleOfClystHeath1455.PNG|thumb|Map of the location of the Clyst engagement, 1455]]
Devon marched from Exeter to encounter Bonville at [[Clyst Heath]]; there are very few extant sources for the event, and only one chronicler provides any details, saying he "departed out of the city with his people into the field of Clyst, and there bickered and fought with the Lord Bonville and put them to flight, and so returned again that night into the city."&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 171–2&lt;/ref&gt; Many bones were discovered when the site was excavated in 1800, although some, Storey points out, must belong to those killed in the [[Prayer Book Rebellion#Clyst Heath massaacre | 1549 engagement on the same site]]. Although difficult to assess the extent to which the engagement can be described as a battle (one chronicler estimated the dead at twelve men)&lt;ref name="autogenerated10"&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Crown &amp; Political Society in Devon' (PhD thesis, University of Wales (Swansea), 1981), 307&lt;/ref&gt; it does appear to have been decisive in Devon's favour. The earl returned to Exeter, where the [[Mayor of Exeter|mayor]] had "tactfully" laid on a celebration.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"/&gt; Hannes Kleineke has described the mayor's decision to illuminate the city walls on the earl's return as "pragmatic",&lt;ref&gt;Kleineke, H., '"þe Kynges Cite"– Exeter in the Wars of the Roses', in Clarke, L. (ed.), ''Conflicts, Consequences and the Crown in the Later Middle Ages: The Fifteenth Century VII''  (Woodbridge, 2007), 156&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Cherry explains the mayor's behaviour as being due to the fact that the earl, "in his peculiar manner, [had behaved] punctiliously" to the mayor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; The earl subsequently sent a [[sortie (siege warfare)|sortie]] led by [[Thomas Carrew]]&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 172&lt;/ref&gt; to attack Bonville's [[manor]] at [[Old Shute House#Bonville|Shute]] where they faced no resistance and pillaged freely, stealing Bonville's cattle, furnishings, and food.&lt;ref&gt;Orme, N., 'Representation and Rebellion in the Later Middle Ages', in Kain, R. &amp; W. Ravenhill (eds.), ''Historical Atlas of South-West England'' (Exeter, 1999), 141, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The weeks preceding the battle had been accompanied by what has been called "exchange[s] of formal declarations of war disguised in the chivalric mode of challenges to a duel."&lt;ref name="autogenerated10" /&gt; Michael Hicks has suggested that, in spite of the earl's clear superiority in numbers, it was Bonville who "goaded the earl into a fair fight," and that "in the spirit of chivalry" the confrontation at Clyst was his fault.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, M.A., The Wars of the Roses, (Yale, 2010), 116&lt;/ref&gt; Cherry too has suggested that Bonville and Courtenay of Powderham deliberately attempted to recruit members of the earl's historical tenantry, further poisoning relations,&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M. 'The Courtenay Earls of Devon: The Formation and Disintegration of a Late Medieval Aristocratic Affinity', ''Southern History'', 1 (1979), 95&lt;/ref&gt; and also that, although doubtless the earl has deserved the 'universally bad press' he has received from modern historians, he was still "reluctant to go to war," and that he did so "only after all other methods of achieving his aims&amp;nbsp;... had failed."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Glourcester, 1981), 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response from government==

The leftmost tower dates from 1390–1450 as does the main high central block, which originally housed a full-height [[great hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Powderham Castle guide book, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
However decisive the Earl of Devon's victory had been, it had also drawn the attention of the government. This was still under the control of Bonville's allies, York, Salisbury, and Warwick, but had up until that point the Yorkists had failed to intervene in this local feud. The feud has been described as an example of local activities influencing parliament itself,&lt;ref&gt;Lander, J.R., 'Henry Vl and the Duke of York's Second Protectorate, 1455-6', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', 3 (1960), 59&lt;/ref&gt; and Griffiths said it was used as "a pretext for demanding York's appointment as protector."&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, R.A., ''The Reign of Henry VI'', (Berkeley 1981), 755&lt;/ref&gt; When parliament reassembled on 12 November it was presented with reports that Devon was leading an army of about 4,000 men and including 400 cavalry to London. The king was still incapacitated. Unable to manage the situation; the Duke of York used the immediate necessity for intervention as a mechanism for being formally appointed Protector. He did not immediately hasten to the south west to punish the Earl of Devon, though. The earl was merely dismissed from his role on the [[Justice of the peace|commission of the peace]] in early December.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 172–3&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the local gentry were ordered to be ready to assist York. The duke did not set out until news was received of the Clyst confrontation. One chronicler states that following his defeat, Bonville "fled, and came to Grenewiche to the kyng, and the kyng sent him agayne to the lord protectour;"&lt;ref&gt;Lander, J.R., 'Henry Vl and the Duke of York's Second Protectorate, 1455-6', ''Bulletin of the John Rylands Library'', 3 (1960), 64&lt;/ref&gt; although it is also possible that he was committed to the [[Fleet Prison]] for a short time.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Crown &amp; Political Society in Devon' (Ph.D thesis, University of Wales (Swansea) 1981), 303&lt;/ref&gt; When finally York left for the south west, he summoned the Earl of Devon to [[Shaftesbury]] where the earl was arrested and sent to the [[Tower of London]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The Earl of Devon remained imprisoned for only a few months. It is possible that an attempt was made to bring him to trial in February, but if so, it was probably – in Storey's words – "countermanded." This could have been, he suggests, indicative of York's "waning" position, as the protectorate was soon to come to an end:&lt;ref name="autogenerated11"/&gt; Cherry has said that the king's resumption of personal power in February 1456 must have come as "a considerable relief" to the earl.&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 138&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have taken the Yorkists' eclipse as a further opportunity to continue the feud, which provoked governmental admonishment in March, when his son [[John Courtenay, 15th Earl of Devon|John Courtenay]], with 500 armed men, again prevented the Exeter justices of the peace from sitting, and evicted them. [[Letters patent|Commissions]] of ''[[oyer and terminer]]'' were issued in August, being led by Bonville's ally the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 173–4&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bonville presented a long list of offences committed by Devon to the council (whilst mitigating his own involvement), the crown "was obviously unimpressed" by this, and eventually not only restored Devon to commission of the peace (12 September 1456) but also pardoned him and his sons for any involvement in the murder of Radford, eventually even appointing him to the lucrative office of keeper of the forest and park of [[Clarendon Park, Wiltshire|Clarendon]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt; The region subsequently remained quiet; Bonville was of advanced age and Devon was possibly unwell, as he died in [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] within eighteen months.&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 174&lt;/ref&gt; His will was executed by some of the most important men on the Queen's council.&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt;

The region took no active part in the ensuing civil wars until the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471, but both parties to the feud were killed in the civil wars over the next few years. The new [[Thomas Courtenay, 6th/14th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], who had killed Radford, was a thorough supporter of the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] regime. After the [[House of York|Yorkist]] victory at the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]] in June 1460, he took his troops northwards to [[Margaret of Anjou]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated12"/&gt; in [[York]], where, in April 1461, he was executed by the new king, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] after the [[Battle of Towton]]. Bonville's son and grandson had been killed with the [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Duke of York]] and the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]] at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] in December 1460, and Bonville himself, captured after the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] was summarily beheaded&lt;ref&gt;Storey, R.L., ''The End of the House of Lancaster'' (Guildford, 1966), 174–5&lt;/ref&gt; – probably, so the chroniclers tell us, after a mock trial directly instigated by the Earl of Devon.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, M., 'The Struggle for Power in Mid-Fifteenth Century Devonshire', in Griffiths, R.A. (ed.), ''Patronage, the Crown and the Provinces in Later Medieval England'' (Gloucester, 1981), 138–9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Certified wood''' and paper products come from responsibly managed forests – as defined by a particular standard. With third-party forest certification, an independent organization develops standards of good forest management, and independent auditors issue certificates to forest operations that comply with those standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore Forest Certification Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
'''Forest certification''' programs typically require that forest management practices conform to existing laws. Other basic requirements or characteristics of forest certification programs include:

Basic requirements of credible forest certification programs include:
* Protection of biodiversity, species at risk and wildlife habitat; sustainable harvest levels; protection of water quality; and prompt regeneration (e.g., replanting and reforestation).
* Third-party certification audits performed by accredited certification bodies.
* Publicly available certification audit summaries.
* Multi-stakeholder involvement in a standards development process.
* Complaints and appeals process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf National Association of State Foresters Policy Statement 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Today there are more than 50 certification programs worldwide &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturallywood.com/uploadedFiles/General/Sustainable_Forests/Third_Party_Forest_Certification.pdf Third-Party Forest Certification in British Columbia]&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the many types of forests and tenures around the world. The two largest international forest certification programs are the [[Forest Stewardship Council]] (FSC) and the [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification]] (PEFC).

The PEFC is the largest certification framework in terms of forest area, with approximately two-thirds of the total certified area. The FSC program is the fastest growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 115] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third-party forest certification was pioneered in the early 1990s by the FSC, a collaboration between [[Environmental organizations|environmental]] [[Non-governmental organizations|NGOs]], forest product companies and social interests. Competing systems quickly emerged throughout the world. Some commentators, including [[Jared Diamond]], have suggested that many competing standards were set up by logging companies specifically aiming to confuse consumers with less rigorously enforced but similarly named competing standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== United States and Canada ===

In the United States and Canada, there are a number of forest certification programs. Three of these programs are endorsed by the PEFC. They are the [[American Tree Farm System]] (ATFS), the [[Canadian Standards Association]]’s [[Sustainable Forest Management Standard]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ CSA International Forest Products Marking] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019030053/http://www.csa-international.org/product_areas/forest_products_marking/ |date=2011-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sustainable Forestry Initiative]] (SFI) Program. ATFS is applicable only in the United States; the Canadian Standards Association SFM Standard is applicable only in Canada. SFI is applicable to both the United States and Canada. The FSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsccanada.org/forestmanagementstd.htm Forest Stewardship Council Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fscus.org FSC United States]&lt;/ref&gt; program is applied throughout North America. SFI is the world’s largest regional forest certification program in terms of total certified forest area[1].

The [[National Association of State Foresters]] in the USA passed a resolution in 2008 that supports ''all'' of the forest certification systems used in the USA and recognized the value of their differences: “... the ATFS, FSC, and SFI systems include the fundamental elements of credibility and make positive contributions to forest sustainability.... No certification program can credibly claim to be ‘best’, and no certification program that promotes itself as the only certification option can maintain credibility. Forest ecosystems are complex and a simplistic ‘one size fits all’ approach to certification cannot address all sustainability needs.”.&lt;ref name="C3"&gt;[http://stateforesters.org/files/2008.Forest%20Certification.pdf Forest Certification as it Contributes to Sustainable Forestry]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Canadian Council of Forest Ministers]] issued a statement in 2008 on forest certification standards in Canada, which said: “In Canada, each jurisdiction’s forest laws, policies and administrative requirements comprise an {{sic|hide=y|over-|arching}} framework that fully characterizes what sustainable forest management (SFM) means in that jurisdiction, and what actions may take place on public and/or private forest land. Governments in Canada support third-party forest certification as a tool to demonstrate the rigor of Canada’s forest management laws, and to document the country’s world-class sustainable forest management record. The forest management standards of the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), the FSC and the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) are all used in Canada. Governments in Canada accept that these standards demonstrate, and promote the sustainability of forest management practices in Canada.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccfm.org/pdf/CCFM_Statement_FRandEN.pdf#page=2 Canadian Council of Forest Ministers Statement on Forest Certification Standards in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chain-of-custody certification==

Chain of Custody certification tracks the certified material through the production process – from the forest to the consumer, including all successive stages of processing, transformation, manufacturing and distribution. It also provides evidence that certified material in a certified product originates from certified forests.

The United Nations reports that between January 2009 and May 2010, the total number of PEFC and FSC chain-of-custody certificates issued worldwide increased by 88% for a total of 23,717 certificates (this does not include SFI certificates).&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 118] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future expansion==

Forest certification is a voluntary process. About 10% of the world’s forest under at least one certification program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 113] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers that choose to buy certified products are supporting land managers, land owners and forest product companies that have made a commitment to meeting the standards of forest certification.

Third-party forest certification is a useful tool for those seeking to purchase paper and wood products that come from forests that are well-managed and use materials that are legally harvested. Incorporating third-party certification into forest product buying practices can be a centerpiece for responsible wood and paper purchasing policies that include factors such as the protection of sensitive forest values, thoughtful material selection and efficient use of products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metafore.org/index.php?p=About+Certification&amp;s=153 Metafore]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009-2010 United Nations Market Review reported that companies that produced or traded in certified forest products often had a market advantage during the 2008-2009 recession because, in a buyers’ market, buyers could be more selective in choosing their sources of supply. The report cites four demand drivers for certification:&lt;ref&gt;[http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf UNECE/FAO 2009-2010 Forest Products Annual Market Review  page 114] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820151542/http://timber.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/publications/sp-25.pdf |date=2010-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Paper, publishing, printing and packaging – commitments to increase the use of responsible paper sources by large publishers such as Time Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeinc.com/community/sustainability.php Time Inc. Sustainability Report 2009-2010 page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; has probably been the most significant factor driving growth in forest and chain-of-custody certification.
* Green public procurement – governments such as the UK and the Netherlands have adopted green timber procurement policies, including recognition of FSC and PEFC endorsed programs. An example is the UK’s Central Point of Expertise on Timber (set up by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and operated by ProForest).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpet.org.uk/evidence-of-compliance/category-a-evidence/introduction Central Point of Expertise on Timber]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Green building – standards for green building incentivize and reward the use of certified wood products.
*Illegal logging – new legislation designed to minimize the risk of illegal wood entering supply chains such as the amended Lacey Act in the United States has created a strong incentive to demand independently certified wood that can address illegal logging concerns.

The World Resources Institute, in partnership with the Environmental Investigation Agency, released a fact sheet designed to answer some of the frequently asked questions about the Lacey Act, which was amended in 2008 to ban commerce in illegally sourced plants and their products—including timber, wood, and paper products. The fact sheet says forest certification is a very good approach for demonstrating due care by showing government and customers that a company has taken proactive steps to eliminate illegal wood or plant material from its supply chain. Certification does not relieve importers of the requirement to submit appropriate import declaration information to U.S. government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/stories/2009/12/fact-sheet-are-you-ready-lacey-act World Resources Institute fact sheet Are You Ready for the Lacey Act?]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van Dyck - Charity.jpg|right|thumb|220px|[[Allegory|Allegorical]] personification of ''Charity'' as a mother with three infants by [[Anthony van Dyck]] ]]

In [[Christian]] [[theology]], '''Charity''' ([[Latin]] '''''Caritas''''') is considered as one of the [[Seven virtues|seven virtues]] and is understood by [[Thomas Aquinas]] as "the friendship of man for God", which "unites us to [[God]]". He holds it as "the most excellent of the [[cardinal virtue|virtues]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3023.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: Charity, considered in itself (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q. 23)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Aquinas holds that "the habit of charity extends not only to the love of God, but also to the love of our neighbor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3025.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The object of charity (Secunda Secundae Partis, Q.25)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catechism of the Catholic Church defines "charity" as "the [[theological virtue]] by which we love God above all things for His own sake, and our neighbor as ourselves for the love of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#448/z|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|author=|date=|website=usccb.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caritas: the altruistic love==
The phrase ''Deus caritas est'' from {{bibleverse|1|John|4:8|4}}—or ''Θεὸς ἀγάπη ἐστίν'' (Theos agapē estin) in the original Greek&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblehub.com/interlinear/1_john/4.htm|title=1 John 4  Interlinear Bible|author=|date=|website=biblehub.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is translated in the King James Version as: "God is love", and in the [[Douay-Rheims]] bible as: "God is charity" ({{bibleverse|1|John|4:8|63}}). Thomas Aquinas does not simply equate charity with "[[Love (religious views)#Christian|love]]", which he holds as a passion, not a virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2026.htm|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The passions of the soul in particular: and first, of love (Prima Secundae Partis, Q. 26)|author=|date=|website=www.newadvent.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[King James Version]] uses both the words ''charity'' and ''love'' to translate the idea of ''caritas''/ἀγάπη (agapē): sometimes it uses one, then sometimes the other, for the same concept.  Most other English translations, both before and since, do not; instead, throughout they use the same more direct English word ''love''.  Love can have other meanings in English, but as used in the [[New Testament]] it almost always refers to the virtue of ''caritas''.

Many times when charity is mentioned in English-language bibles, it refers to "love of God", which is a spiritual love that is extended from God to man and then reflected by man, who is made in the image of God, back to God. God gives man the power to act as God acts (God is love), man then reflects God's power in his own human actions towards others. One example of this movement is "charity shall cover the multitude of sins" ({{bibleverse|1|Peter|4:8|KJV}}). "The practice of charity brings us to act toward ourselves and others out of love alone, precisely because each person has the dignity of a beloved child of God."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osv.com/Article/TabId/493/ArtMID/13569/ArticleID/10360/What-is-Virtue.aspx King, Will. "What is Virtue?", ''Our Sunday Visitor'', November 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a theological virtue==
[[File:William-Adolphe Bouguereau (1825-1905) - Charity (1878).jpg|thumb|upright|''Charity'' by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] ]]

Charity is held to be the ultimate perfection of the human spirit, because it is said to both glorify and reflect the nature of God. Confusion can arise from the multiple meanings of the English word "love".  As other theological virtues, Charity is divinely infused into the soul; it resides in the ''will''.&lt;ref name=sollier&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09397a.htm Sollier, Joseph. "Love (Theological Virtue)." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 21 Aug. 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Aquinas, charity is an absolute requirement for happiness, which he holds as man's last goal.

Charity has two parts: love of God and love of man, which includes both love of one's neighbor and one's self.&lt;ref name=sollier/&gt;

In [[1 Corinthians 13]], [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] places the greater emphasis on Charity (Love). "So faith, hope, love remain, these three; but the greatest of these is love." He describes it as:

{{quote|Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become ''as'' sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though I have ''the gift of'' prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed ''the poor'', and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.

Charity never faileth: but whether ''there be'' prophecies, they shall fail; whether ''there be'' tongues, they shall cease; whether ''there be'' knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away....And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these ''is'' charity.}}

The fruits of charity are joy, peace, and mercy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ccc.usccb.org/flipbooks/catechism/index.html#450/z|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church|author=|date=|website=usccb.org|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] issued the encyclical ''[[Deus caritas est]]'', in which he discussed "... the love which God lavishes upon us and which we in turn must share with others."&lt;ref&gt;[https://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20051225_deus-caritas-est.html Pope Benedict XVI, ''Deus caritas est'', December 25, 2005, Libreria Editrice Vaticana]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a member of the aspartyl proteases, HIV protease is highly substrate-selective and cleavage-specific.

==Chou’s distorted key theory==
Knowledge of the protein cleavage sites by HIV protease can provide very useful information for finding effective inhibitors against the culprit enzyme, as elaborated by [[Kuo-Chen Chou]].&lt;ref name="Chou01"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chou K.C. | title = Review: Prediction of human immunodeficiency virus protease cleavage sites in proteins | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 233 |  pages = 1–14 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8789141 | doi = 10.1006/abio.1996.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Fisher’s [[lock-and-key model]] proposed by [[Hermann Emil Fischer]] in 1884 and Koshland’s [[induced fit]] theory by [[Daniel E. Koshland, Jr.]] in 1958, given a peptide, the prerequisite condition for it to be cleaved by HIV-protease is a good fit and binding between the substrate and the enzyme’s active site.  However, such a peptide, after a modification on its scissile bond with some simple chemical procedure, will completely lose its cleavability but it can still tightly bind to the enzyme’s active site. According to [[Kuo-Chen Chou]], the molecule thus modified can be likened to a ‘‘distorted key”,&lt;ref name=Chou01/&gt; which can be inserted into a lock but can neither open the lock nor automatically get out from it. That is why a molecule modified from a cleavable peptide can spontaneously become a competitive inhibitor against the enzyme.

An illustration about Chou’s distorted key theory is given in Fig.3, where panel (a) shows an effective binding of a cleavable peptide to the active site of HIV protease, while panel (b) the peptide has become a non-cleavable one after its scissile bond is modified although it can still bind to the active site. Such a modified peptide, or ‘‘distorted key”, will automatically become an [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] candidate against HIV protease.

[[Image:K3 distorted key.jpg|thumb|right|400px| Figure 3. An illustration for the Chou’s distorted key theory, where panel (a) shows an effective binding of a cleavable peptide to the active site of HIV protease, while panel (b) the peptide has become a non-cleavable one after its scissile bond is modified although it can still bind to the active site. Such a modified peptide, or ‘‘distorted key”, will automatically become an inhibitor candidate against HIV protease.]]

Even for non-peptide inhibitors, the information derived from the cleavable peptides can also provide useful insights about the key binding groups and fitting conformation, among many other detailed requirements in [[Habitat|microenvironment]].

Many efforts have been made to predict the protein cleavage sites by HIV-protease (see, e.g.,

In [[media studies]], '''concision''' is a form of [[broadcast media]] [[censorship]] by limiting debate and discussion of important topics on the rationale of time allotment.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;[http://users.utu.fi/bredelli/C8.htm Finnish Views of CNN, Chapter 8: The Structural Constraint of "Concision" as it is Used in the Discourse Style of American Commercial Broadcasting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423095239/http://users.utu.fi/bredelli/C8.htm |date=2012-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media critics such as [[Noam Chomsky]] contend that this practice, especially on commercial broadcasts with [[advertising]], encourages broadcasters to exclude people and ideas that they judge cannot conform to the time limits of a particular program.  This leads to a limited number of "the usual suspects" who will say expected ideas that will not require extensive explanation such as mainstream political ones.


'''The beauty of concision, you know, saying a couple sentences between two commercials, the beauty of that is you can only repeat conventional thoughts. Suppose I go on Nightline, whatever it is, two minutes, and I say Gaddafi is a terrorist, Khomeini is a murderer etcetera etcetera…I don’t need any evidence, everyone just nods. On the other hand, suppose you’re saying something that isn’t just regurgitating conventional pieties, suppose you say something that’s the least bit unexpected or controversial, people will quite reasonably expect to know what you mean. If you said that you’d better have a reason, better have some evidence. You can’t give evidence if you’re stuck with concision. That’s the genius of this structural constraint.'''&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;[https://ohtarzie.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/greenwald-on-chomsky-and-staying-in-the-mainstream-without-compromise/  Greenwald on Chomsky and Staying In the Mainstream Without Compromise]{{cite web |url=https://ohtarzie.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/greenwald-on-chomsky-and-staying-in-the-mainstream-without-compromise/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, introducing controversial or unexpected statements that do not conform to those conventional ideas are discouraged as time inefficient because the person will be required to explain and support them in detail.  Since this can often take considerable time in itself and digress from the primary discussion topic of the broadcast, this is discouraged.  Alternatively, the explanation could be subject to extensive editing for time which could lead to an inadequate presentation of the subject's thoughts.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

==Illustration==

This media control idea is illustrated in the [[film documentary]], ''[[Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media]]'', where journalist [[Jeff Greenfield]] explains why a person like Chomsky may be excluded from being interviewed on air because he takes too long to warm up. The film then follows up with Chomsky himself explaining the concept while the film gives examples of controversial statements he has made in the past that would require extensive explanation in an interview.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

The 1999 feature film ''[[The Insider (film)|The Insider]]'' has a dramatization of the media concept where journalist [[Mike Wallace]] goes public on a news show about the censoring of a controversial story on ''[[60 Minutes]]''.  When Wallace sees his interview broadcast, he is furious that his testimony is limited to a curt statement that does not adequately explain his position and the only excuse from the producers he receives is that it had to be cut for time.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8300">In [[condensed matter physics]], a '''Cooper pair''' or '''BCS pair''' is a pair of electrons (or other [[fermion]]s) bound together at low temperatures in a certain manner first described in 1956 by American physicist [[Leon Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

In conventional [[Superconductivity|superconductors]], this attraction is due to the [[electron]]–[[phonon]] interaction. The Cooper pair state is responsible for superconductivity, as described in the [[BCS theory]] developed by [[John Bardeen]], [[Leon Cooper]], and [[John Schrieffer]] for which they shared the 1972 [[Nobel Prize]].&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics"&gt;

Although Cooper pairing is a quantum effect, the reason for the pairing can be seen from a simplified classical explanation.&lt;ref name="Hyperphysics"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electron in a metal normally behaves as a free particle. The electron is repelled from other electrons due to their negative [[charge (physics)|charge]], but it also attracts the positive [[ion]]s that make up the rigid lattice of the metal. This attraction distorts the ion lattice, moving the ions slightly toward the electron, increasing the positive charge density of the lattice in the vicinity. This positive charge can attract other electrons. At long distances, this attraction between electrons due to the displaced ions can overcome the electrons' repulsion due to their negative charge, and cause them to pair up. The rigorous quantum mechanical explanation shows that the effect is due to [[electron]]–[[phonon]] interactions, with the phonon being the collective motion of the positively-charged lattice.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy of the pairing interaction is quite weak, of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Electron volt|eV]], and thermal energy can easily break the pairs. So only at low temperatures, in metal and other substrates, are a significant number of the electrons in Cooper pairs.

The electrons in a pair are not necessarily close together; because the interaction is long range, paired electrons may still be many hundreds of [[nanometre|nanometers]] apart. This distance is usually greater than the average interelectron distance so that many Cooper pairs can occupy the same space.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Electrons have [[Spin-½|spin-{{frac|1|2}}]], so they are [[fermion]]s, but the total spin of a Cooper pair is integer (0 or 1) so it is a [[composite boson]]. This means the [[wave function]]s are symmetric under particle interchange.  Therefore, unlike electrons, multiple Cooper pairs are allowed to be in the same quantum state, which is responsible for the phenomena of superconductivity.

The BCS theory is also applicable to other fermion systems, such as [[helium-3]]. Indeed, Cooper pairing is responsible for the [[superfluidity]] of helium-3 at low temperatures. It has also been recently demonstrated that a Cooper pair can comprise two bosons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.optical-lattice.com/index.php?lattice-site=cooper-pairs Cooper Pairs of Bosons]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the pairing is supported by [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] in an optical lattice.

== Relationship to superconductivity ==
The tendency for all the Cooper pairs in a body to "[[Bose–Einstein condensation|condense]]" into the same [[Ground state|ground quantum state]] is responsible for the peculiar properties of superconductivity.

Cooper originally considered only the case of an isolated pair's formation in a metal. When one considers the more realistic state of many electronic pair formations, as is elucidated in the full BCS theory, one finds that the pairing opens a gap in the continuous spectrum of allowed energy states of the electrons, meaning that all excitations of the system must possess some minimum amount of energy. This ''gap to excitations'' leads to superconductivity, since small excitations such as scattering of electrons are forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;

The gap appears due to many-body effects between electrons feeling the attraction.

R. A. Ogg, Jr., was first to suggest that electrons might act as pairs coupled by lattice vibrations in the material.&lt;ref&gt;Ogg Jr, R.A., "Bose-Einstein Condensation of Trapped Electron Pairs. Phase
Separation and Superconductivity of Metal-Ammonia Solutions," ''Phys. Rev.'' 69, 243-244, (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Poole Jr, Charles P, "Encyclopedic dictionary of condensed matter physics", (Academic Press, 2004), p. 576&lt;/ref&gt; This was indicated by the [[isotope]] effect observed in superconductors. The isotope effect showed that materials with heavier ions (different [[isotope|nuclear isotopes]]) had lower superconducting transition temperatures. This can be explained by the theory of Cooper pairing: heavier ions are harder for the electrons to attract and move (how Cooper pairs are formed), which results in smaller binding energy for the pairs.

The theory of Cooper pairs is quite general and does not depend on the specific electron-phonon interaction.  Condensed matter theorists have proposed pairing mechanisms based on other attractive interactions such as electron–[[exciton]] interactions or electron–[[plasmon]] interactions. Currently, none of these other pairing interactions has been observed in any material.

It should be mentioned that Cooper pairing does not involve individual electrons pairing up to form "quasi-bosons". The paired states are energetically favored, and electrons go in and out of those states preferentially. This is a fine distinction that John Bardeen makes:

:''"The idea of paired electrons, though not fully accurate, captures the sense of it." &lt;ref&gt;J. Bardeen, "Electron-Phonon Interactions and Superconductivity", in Cooperative Phenomena, eds. H. Haken and M. Wagner (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, 1973), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;''

The mathematical description of the second-order coherence involved here is given by Yang.&lt;ref&gt;C. N. Yang, "Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order." ''Rev. Mod. Phys.'' 34, 694 (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cortex System''' is a generic RPG system based on the ''[[Sovereign Stone (role-playing game)|Sovereign Stone System]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}'', and was developed by [[Margaret Weis Productions, Ltd]] for the [[Serenity Role Playing Game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thed6generation.com/d6g_episode_18_serenity_rpg_reviewed_interview_with_designer |title=D6G Episode 18: Serenity RPG reviewed &amp; interview with designer |work=The D6 Generation |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=March 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was subsequently used for their licensed ''[[Battlestar Galactica Role Playing Game|Battlestar Galactica]]'' and [[Supernatural Role Playing Game|Supernatural]] RPGs, and brought out as a stand-alone system in the ''Cortex System Role Playing Game'' book&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/14/14750.phtml RPG.net review of Cortex Classic]&lt;/ref&gt; (also called the ''Cortex Classic System Role Playing Game'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/58488/Cortex-Classic-System-Role-Playing-Game Cortex Classic System RPG listing]&lt;/ref&gt;  Serenity, using the Cortex System, was the 2005 Origins Award Gamer's Choice Role Playing Game of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rpggeek.com/rpg/285/serenity-role-playing-game RPG Geek Serenity RPG page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that despite the similar name, the Cortex System is not the [[Cortex Plus]] system, also produced by Margaret Weis Productions.

==The basic system==

The system uses [[dice]] with 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 sides, described with the standard role-playing game [[Dice notation|notation]] of d2, d4, d6, d8, and so on, and the basic resolution system involves adding up the total on all your relevant dice and comparing it to a static target number.  The three parts of your [[dice pool]] are your relevant Attributes (Agility, Strength, Vitality, Alertness, Intelligence, and Willpower) which range from d4 to d12+d4, your relevant Skill (from a list of 22) which range from 0 to d12, and any relevant Assets (positive character traits) or Complications (negative traits).  Situational advantages can be represented either by changing the target difficulty number or increasing or reducing the number of faces on the dice rolled.

The ''Cortex System'' also uses [[plot point (role-playing games)|Plot Points]], which increase characters' survivability and give players greater control over events in the game. Players can spend Plot Points to gain extra dice when making a die roll, reduce the damage from an attack, or even make changes to the storyline. Some Assets also require the expenditure of Plot Points. At the end of a game session, excess Plot Points are converted to Advancement Points, which a player spends to improve his or her character's abilities.

==Character Creation==

The game uses a point-buy system with a default initial spread between attributes, skills, and traits (the collective name for advantages and complications) based on the intended power level of the game. This is similar to the siloed point buy and special abilities and character flaws used in a variety of other role-playing games, such as Merits and Flaws in [[White Wolf Publishing]]'s original ''[[World of Darkness]]'', Qualities and Drawbacks in Eden Unisystem, and Edges and Hindrances in [[Pinnacle Entertainment Group|Pinnacle Entertainment's]] ''[[Deadlands]]'' and ''[[Savage Worlds]]'' games (to which the Serenity system bears a strong resemblance).

==Published games using the Cortex System==

* [[Serenity (role-playing game)]] 
* [[Battlestar Galactica Role Playing Game]] 
* [[Demon Hunters Role Playing Game]]
* Cortex System Role Playing Game 
* [[Supernatural Role Playing Game]]

==Reception==

The initial reception to the Cortex System was good, with the Serenity Role Playing Game winning the 2005 [[Origins Award]] for Gamer's Choice: Best Roleplaying Game of the Year.&lt;ref name="2005 Origins"&gt;[http://gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe2000s/The2005OriginsAwards/tabid/3250/Default.aspx 2005 Origins Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227142121/http://gama.org/OriginsAwards/OriginsAwardsWinnersThe2000s/The2005OriginsAwards/tabid/3250/Default.aspx |date=2013-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Battlestar Galactica Role Playing Game]] gained praise from [[SF Weekly]] for the Plot Point mechanisms and the way they reproduced the all-or-nothing moments of the [[Battlestar Galactica]] series.&lt;ref name="SF Weekly"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070915061913/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/games/sfw16936.html SF Weekly review of Battlestar Galactica]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Journal of Transformative Works said that the system itself could be considered transformative given that the rules were meant to evolve through play sessions.&lt;ref name="JTW"&gt;[http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/191/162 Book Review: Supernatural role playing game, by Jamie Chambers] - the Journal of Transformative Works&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the [[Smallville Roleplaying Game]], RPGamer commented that "Smallville does something rare in a licensed game: not only does it deliver an experience that captures the feel of the original, but also comes up with a set of mechanics that create an entirely new dynamic for roleplaying." &lt;ref name="RPGamer Smallville"&gt;[http://www.rpgamer.com/savingthrow/reviews/rev-SV.html Review of Smallville by RPGamer]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criminal responsibility''' is the obligation in French law to answer for infractions committed and to suffer the [[punishment]] provided by the [[legislation]] that governs the infraction in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Gérard|last1=Cornu|first2=Association Henri Capitant|last2=dir.|title=Vocabulaire juridique|location=Paris|publisher=[[Presses Universitaires de France]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[democracy]] citizens have rights but also duties: with freedom comes responsibility.

Unlike civil [[legal liability|liability]], the obligation to answer for damage one has caused, either by repairing it or paying [[damages]] and interest for it, criminal responsibility implies [[legal recourse]] for the state against a disturbance of the peace. This includes three major factors:
*participation in a criminal offense
*forms of criminal responsibility
*exceptions to criminal responsibility.

== Participation ==

=== The author and the co-author ===
* '''The material author''' of the infraction is the person who physically performs the actions necessary to make up the criminal action. In the case of a [[murder]] this would be the person who struck the fatal blow. For crimes of [[omission (law)|omission]] the material author would be the person who didn't move when he had the possibility to rescue someone. Under the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' a [[collective responsibility]] was often envisaged. This concept disappeared in the codes, although jurisprudence sometimes makes use of a concept of collective guilt, but this is most apparent in [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] cases. (Article 450-1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-450-1|title=Code pénal – Article 450-1|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Indeed, in a conspiracy, each participant in the group is considered the principal author of the infraction.
* '''The co-author''' materially participates in events at the side of the principal author, and incurs the same prescribed penalties, even if the principal author is in the end finally declared non-responsible, as in a case of [[dementia]] for example. The co-author may have [[extenuating circumstances]] such as youth. [[Aggravation (law)|Aggravating circumstances]] are also possible, such as [[recidivism]]. Not to be confused with the accomplice, who would, for example, be the person who furnished the killer with a weapon.
* '''The moral''' author acts in the wings to have the crime committed, for example someone who pays to have a person killed or to have an object stolen, and is sometimes also called the intellectual author. French law doesn't really have this concept and such actions are addressed as conspiracies and sometimes described as [[complicity]] by [[provocation (legal)|provocation]] or by instruction.
* In the transition from the Napoleonic [[French Penal Code of 1810|penal code of 1810]] to the newer reformed criminal code, the [[law commission|reform commission]] considered including an autonomous criminal responsibility for intellectual authors but quickly abandoned the idea in the face of the difficulty of implementing such a modification of the criminal code while at the same time still preserving freedoms. However, in certain cases the moral authors may be prosecuted for the offense themselves, for instance for provocation to suicide or untruths. The untruths themselves are not criminal offences, nor is suicide. The "Perben 2" law of 2004 also created a specific infraction of instigating a  crime, and sanctions the moral author of certain crimes, even when the instigation was not successful and the crime was not committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2004/01/27/loi-perben-les-cinq-points-inquietants-pour-les-libertes-publiques_350647_3224.html|title=Loi Perben : les cinq points inquiétants pour les libertés publiques|trans-title=Perben Law: the five worrying points for public liberties|date=January 27, 2004|work=Le Monde Société|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempt ===
The penal code declares that the authorship of a crime includes not just the person who commits the incriminating act, but also he who in the cases provided by the law, only [[attempt]]s to commit it.

An attempt is constituted when a beginning of execution has manifested and only was suspended or failed to have an effect because of circumstances independent of the author's will (Article 121-5)

A person is an [[accomplice]] who knowingly offers aid or assistance to the preparation or commission of an infraction. A person is equally an accomplice a person who by gift, promise, threat order abuse of authority or of power provokes into an infraction or who gives instructions for committing it (Article 121-7)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-121-7|title=Article 121-7 of the penal code}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 121-4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-121-4|title=Article 121-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the penal code says that trying to commit a crime is punishable, but attempting to commit a [[misdemeanor]] is not, unless a law specifically so provides. Attempting to commit an infraction is never an offense. The author of an attempt is considered an author of the actual infraction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-121-6|title=Article 121-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the penal code, and incurs the same penalties as if his attempt had succeeded.

==== Material element ====

===== The beginning of execution =====
An attempt must manifest through the beginning of the commission of the infraction. The actor is no longer at the stage of preparatory actions, yet has not yet entirely found himself involved in the principal infraction. Jurisprudence defines the beginning of execution as the act or acts that "directly tend to the consommation of the infraction" (''tendant directement à la consommation de l'infraction'').

Example: arrêt Lacour, crim. 25 October 1962: Mr Lacour paid an individual to murder the adopted son of his mistress. The hired killer pretended to kidnap the adopted son, then collected his payment before reporting Lacour to the police. Lacour was prosecuted, notably, for [[attempted murder]].

He was acquitted however, on the theory that his actions did not tend either directly or immediately towards the death of the victim. In reality, his actions were not attempted murder; they amounted to attempted conspiracy to commit murder. No matter what, Lacour would never have been a murderer, just an accomplice. Without having acted immediately and directly to commit the crime, he did not have a punishable attempt under the law of [[intention (criminal law)|intent]] (although his actions could nonetheless be sanctioned under other criteria).

Attempted [[insurance fraud]] has given place to an important piece of jurisprudence: simply simulating a fire is merely a non-punishable act of preparation, because it does not result immediately and directly in disbursement of the policy amount. On the other hand, submitting a claim to the insurance company after making a false statement to the police would constitute the beginning of execution for the crime of fraud. A false declaration or statement, accompanied by fraudulent manoeuvers, or by staging or manipulating the evidence, have also been considered to amount to a beginning of execution.

===== Failure to voluntarily desist =====
An attempt is a failed crime and the failure of that crime was contrary to the will of its author. On the other hand, preparing then voluntarily desisting from the criminality before the crime is committed halts any prosecution.

This mechanism can be explained differently. The person who voluntarily renounces his criminal business has shown that he wasn't dangerous. The law encourages future wrongdoers to renounce their path and offers [[impunity]] as a reward. One can equally explain the mechanism by justifying its prevention of criminal attempts: the idea is to punish the person whose irrevokable criminal [[intention]] has not yet led him to carry out the crime in question. So the person who renounces his criminal intentions proves by doing so that they were not irrevocable, and therefore in law there was no attempted crime.

If the attempt failed for reasons beyond the intentions of its author, such as a missed shot, an unexpected passerby or the arrival of law enforcement, a stooge unexpectedly quitting, or sometimes the actions of the victim (a rapist fleeing because of victim's screams),&lt;ref&gt;Crim. 26 avril 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; the attempted crime is punishable.

The failure to voluntarily desist does not necessarily require the intervention of an outside force: Crim. 10 janvier 1996 held that an attempted rape which could not be completed due to the criminal's sexual dysfunction was nevertheless an attempted rape.

The problem may arise where the causes of the criminal stopping before he commits a crime was are mixed; for example, a moralizing friend dissuades an offender from committing a planned burglary.(Crim. 20 mars 1974). Circumstances in such cases have not forced him to desist but he hasn't independently or spontaneously opted not to commit the crime either.

The letter of the law, article 121-5&lt;ref name="cp 121-5" /&gt; of the penal code, specifies that an attempted crime has occurred when the criminal action did not succeed solely because of circumstances independent of the defendant's actions.

The problem of an offender who flees in fear, for example, perhaps because he heard a noise, must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Jurisprudence generally seems to lean towards impunity when the fear was spontaneous.

Voluntarily desisting must come before the action is taken in order to absolve the defendant of responsibility. Some specialized statutes reward active repentance after an offense is committed, the conspiracy statutes for example, but these remain the exception. Penal law does not as such take into account voluntarily desisting from further offenses after a crime has been committed, seeing this as remorse with no judicial value.

==== Moral element ====
The author of the attempted crime must have had the intent to carry it out. This element, which does not seem particularly remarkable at first glance, is nonetheless essential. This criminal intent justifies preventing attempted crime, regardless of any disturbances of the public order.

==== A special case of attempt: the impossible infraction ====
Impossible offenses are those which were not carried out, not because of clumsiness or a chance intervening event, but because of an objective impossibility to commit the offence.

Some impossibilities are legislated into criminality: for example, the old penal code defined a crime of aborting a woman believed to be pregnant. This can be compared to provisions that refer to real or supposed attributes of certain persons, especially in matters of discrimination (article 225-1)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codesetlois.fr/codepenal/article225-1|title=Article 225-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the penal code. It might seem impossible to be guilty of antisemitism towards a person who isn't Jewish, but this putative infraction is nonetheless outlawed.

Hypothetical impossible infractions unanticipated by legislators remain. Initially, 19th-century jurisprudence considered that if an offense was impossible it was also impossible to outlaw it. Since the offense had not been committed, the only possible grounds to prosecute it would be as an attempted crime.

The reasoning that leads to impunity relies on the very definition of an attempt: starting to execute the criminal action means performing the individual physical movements that lead directly and immediately to the criminal act. When the action is impossible there can exist no actions that tend to lead to it either directly or immediately. Therefore, no punishable attempted crime takes place; what does occur is a disturbance in the public peace.

This reasoning, which has legality going for it as well as a certain rationality, however, allowed offenders to escape prosecution who had nonetheless demonstrated their dangerousness and the irrevocability of their criminal determination. Faced with this reproach, jurisprudence took a middle path, seeking inspiration in doctrinal propositions which notably sought to distinguish between absolute and relative impossibility.

The former occurs when the object of the infraction does not exist, such as in the murder of a corpse, or when the means are intrinsically ineffective, such as poisoning with a non-toxic substance. Relative impossibility exists when the object of it exists but cannot for the moment be reached, or when the means used could have succeeded, a badly-aimed bullet for example. The doctrine also proposed a distinction between impossibility in fact (prosecutable) vs impossibility in law, where a critical element of the infraction is missing.

None of these criteria proved intellectually or judicially satisfactory. The Court of cassation, the French court of final appeal, eventually elected to systematically prosecute impossible infractions within its jurisdiction; see the ''Perdereau'' decision of 16 January 1986. In this case the crime was the attempted murder of a cadaver.

The Court of cassation underlined that the prior demise of the victim was a circumstance beyond the author's control, which could be analyzed as a failure to voluntarily desist, leading to the failure of the planned criminality. The court added that the violence done to the cadaver constituted a beginning to execute the murder. This interpretation does not correspond to the classic definition of beginning to execute; in no case can striking a cadaver lead directly or immediately or in the long term for that matter to the death of a human being.

It is a putative crime, which exists only in the mind of its author, but which is prosecuted because the blows that were struck were struck in the intention of committing the crime. The beginning of execution was not the primary element of this attempt; the attempted crime is used here more as a means to prove irrevokable intention.

Since this decision one may ask about the survival of classical solutions to imaginary infractions:
*is statutory rape carried out against an adult an attempted statutory rape?
*Planning an assassination that uses sorcery and spells, would that be attempted murder?
*Is theft of an object that one actually owns attempted theft

The doctrine excludes from proceedings the hypotheses about motive that they cannot attribute to any crime, contrary to the attempted commission of an impossible infraction it considered sufficient proof of intent to commit a crime. Still, a perceptible difference still separates a murderous attack that would have succeeded if the person had been alive from an allegedly sorcerous assassination, assuming that you don't believe in sorcerous assassination.

The danger is falling into mindless prosecution of simple thoughts and possibly of the desires or craving to do things the justice system would consider criminal, which would essentially amount to thought crime.

=== The accomplice ===
An accomplice furnishes help or assistance that facilitates the preparation or execution of a crime or other offence:"whoever by gift, promise, threat, order, or abuse of authority or power gives instructions to commit an infraction." &lt;!--''Qui par don, promesse, menace, ordre, abus d'autorité ou de pouvoir ou bien donne des instructions pour commettre une infraction.'' --&gt;

Complicity may be defined as a temporary, even momentary, understanding between individuals who are going to commit or try to commit one or more infractions. More simply, an accomplice participates in the action without himself needing to meet each element of the criteria that make up the infraction. As with the infraction itself, assessing the extent of complicity will depend in each case on legal, material and moral elements.

==== Material element ====
Legislators have narrowly and precisely defined the behaviors that can be charged as complicity:
* Help or assistance: Help with the preparation or commission of the offense. This can range from standing lookout to furnishing stamps for false [[documents]] to loaning a vehicle.
* Provocation or instigation: This behavior pushes the author of the offense to commit it, using a means foreseen by the legislation. Thus not all forms of provocation are punishable, only those carried out by:
** gift
** threat
** promise
** order
** [[abuse of authority]] or [[abuse of power|power]].
***Also, whatever method is used must be sufficiently suggestive, individual or direct. Simple advice or suggestion cannot be penalized. And the incitement must be followed by an effect; a murder committed two years later for completely different reasons cannot be criminalized.
* Instructions are information given to facilitate or allow commission of the offense, such as providing the floor plan of a bank building to a robber. For complicity to exist [[causality]] must be established.

Legislators have also provided for a number of cases where complicity is not punishable:

*passive assent
In principle, abstention is never punishable and this has been fairly consistent in case law. In some cases however the judge decided that inaction was punishable, especially where the person had a protective role towards the author, his parents for example, or people whose work this is, such as policemen or guards. Thus in 1989 a mother was found guilty of leaving a weapon available to her son, who used it to kill his father. This theory holds that an accomplice by abstention is punishable if he knew about the offense, and had the means to prevent it but refrained, so that the crime was committed.

*complicity after the fact
In principle help given after the primary act has been performed is not criminalized, but here too legislators have enacted exceptions, criminalizing certain behaviors such as concealing the fruit of a crime, or its author, for example. Case law holds that help after the fact constitutes complicity if it results from a prior agreement. (Although one might suppose that the help is actually constituted by the agreement itself; in effect, promising the offender assistance after the crime is what made up his mind to take action.) The Court of cassation seems to also endorse guilty findings when the offender is an habitual delinquent and the help encourages him to repeat his bad behavior.

==== Moral element ====
The material element cannot be the only criteria as this would engender a climate of suspicion harmful to society. So, therefore, a person can only become an accomplice willingly, and must be aware of the offender's plans and agree with them. Also, if the project described to the accomplice differs from the one that is carried out, the accomplice will only be held to account for the project of which he had knowledge. Therefore, if he loaned a firearm to intimidate and not to kill, he cannot be held responsible for the murder, although this requires also that the difference between the plan and the reality be noticeable. so if simple theft was intended and this became theft with breaking and entering this breaking and entering will be taken into account. Normally there can be no complicity in unintentional offenses but in certain cases, especially faults of imprudence, such as inciting someone to run a red light or to drive while drunk, complicity may be retained.

==== Legal element ====
Criminal law, unlike [[civil law (area)|civil law]], allows very little freedom of interpretation to the judge and the legislator must foresee that which légalement un acte de complicité et notamment la theory de l'emprunt de criminality
* The primary action must be a criminal offense: thus one cannot be prosecuted for having helped in the commission of an act which is not an infraction. The case of provocation to suicide mentioned above is an infraction in itself, although suicide itself is not.
*  In the old penal code the infraction must have had a certain severity (at least have been a misdemeanor) but under the new code it is possible to be an accomplice to a merely citable offense.
* The principal act must have been committed: an accomplice who organizes everything but whose principal author does not begin execution cannot be prosecuted. The infracrtion must at least have been attempted. If a fact may justify the infraction—legitimate defense for example—the infraction is erased and that of the accomplice as well. In cases of immunity, or theft between spouses, the accomplice cannot be prosecuted, unless the judge determines that the person presented as an accomplice is in fact a co-author, in which case he is still within reach of prosecution.

Procedurally the statute of limitations for an accomplice runs from the same day as for the principal author, and the withdrawal of a victim's complaint puts an end to prosecution of the accomplice as well. Amnesty for the infraction also benefits the accomplice.

Another question is whether it complicity in complicity is punishable. Article 121-7 specifies that a second-degree complicity is only legally punishable with respect to knowing or informed help or assistance, even through the intermediary of another accomplice in the case of fraud, but the [[Case law|jurisprudence]] is rather severe and generally finds complicity even in the third degree.

In addition, while it is necessary that the infraction be punishable for complicity to be punishable, the infraction need not necessarily be punished. A guilty verdict for the accomplice is not tied to the sanction of the principal author of the crime. Thus if the principal author is not prosecuted for reasons of dementia, the accomplice can still be prosecuted, and the same if the principal author has died or could not be arrested.

==== Sanction incurred ====

The principle in the old pernal code was that the accomplice and the author incurr the same penalties,

In the new code, the co-author does not necessarily face the same penally as the principal author. Also, he must have been able to commit the primary offense to be sentenced for it. For example, an individual cannot be charged with an offense that can only be committed by a member of law enforcement; he can at most be an accomplice.

Henceforth any personal circumstances that might play in the favor of a principal author no longer do the same for an accomplice, the same real circumstances of the act (break-in, provocation, carrying a weapon)that could be held for or against the principal author will do sa as well for the accomplice.

For example, in the case of a [[homicide]] committed by two persons, one of whom is the son of the victim, the latter, even if only an accomplice to the murder of his father, can receive as heavy a sentence as the principal author, since [[parricide]] constitutes a mixed aggravating circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opgie.com/cours/droit_penal_general/les_circonstances_aggravantes.htm Les circonstances aggravantes sur ''opgie.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persons responsible: the principle of responsibility for personal actions ==

=== Physical persons subject to criminal responsibility ===
* According to article 121-1&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-121-|title=1 Article 121-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the new penal code, "none are penally responsible for any but their own actions." (''Nul n'est responsable pénalement que de son propre fait.'') In the old code this rule existed only in case law. One exception exists, the actions committed by a person under the authority of another. In this precise case, the person with authority can be found guilty of the actions committed by the person under his authority. Such would be the head of a company when an employee causes an accident while making a delivery for the enterprise. He can escape this responsibility by proving a prior delegation of authority, in which case the holder of the authority will be responsible.

==== Minors ====
Normally the attributes of the person do not affect his criminal responsibility, except for the one case where the person is a minor. This distinction is based in part on a difference between the abilities of children and of adults to understand mistakes. Minors, therefore, benefit from dedicated courts, but procedures and penalties also differ.

===== History =====
Until 1912, there were no court procedures specifically geared to minors. It was just generally understood that if a sentence were to be imposed on a minor, he benefitted from the "excuse of youth", which generally reduced the penalty by half.

The law of 22 July 1912 transformed the system by putting juvenile courts into place, along with an absolute presumption of non-responsibility for minors 13 and under. Special penalties were also created in the law, such as supervised freedom, which allowed the minor to be placed in an institution and thus to be re-educated.

Then came the ordonnance du 2 février 1945 on delinquent childhood, which while reworked several times, remains in effect today. In this system it is the personality of the author more than the act itself which enters into account. The system is above all preventive and more geared to avoiding recidivism than to sanctioning a mistake.

==== Advent of the responsibility of minors ====
In France, a minor of 13 cannot be sentenced to a penalty, but is nonetheless responsible for his actions. Article 122-8 of the ''code pénal''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006417221&amp;dateTexte=20081006|title=Article 122 B}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides that "Minors capable of discernment are penally responsible for the crimes, misdemeanors or offences of which they have been found guilty. &lt;!--(''Les mineurs capables de discernement sont pénalement responsables des crimes, délits ou contraventions dont ils ont été reconnus coupables'') --&gt;

While poorly written, Article 122-8 is without possible appeal: a minor who has discernment is responsible for his actions. Still, the many measures that apply to him tend to sow doubt among legal practitioners and some works still speak of the non-responsibility of delinquent juveniles.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

=== Responsibility of leaders and deciders ===
To ensure that certain legal and regulatory provisions are complied with, legislators have over the 20th century accompanied them with penal sanctions.
Generally these have been obstructive offenses destined to prevent serious damage, for example in the case of hygiene and workplace security, of the environment, finance, union rights a collective framework: regulation of some economic activities, of paid work, of public open spaces.

For an infraction to be described as preventive it should not so much incriminate the damaging behavior as the omission of a behavior that is required by law.

How to impute a crime of omission to a person while respecting the principle of personal responsibility?

An offender will, logically, be a person that regulation had exhorted to act, only the person who has an obligation to act can be reproached with not acting.

Some legal obligations to act weigh individually on every citizen: assistance to persons in danger, refraining from homicides and wounding through carelessness.

Others have the specific trait of not being possible to be committed except in a social framework: regulation of certain economic activities, of salaried work, of public spaces.

The law addresses an injunction to leaders and decision-makers of the collective: whether corporate president, mayor of a municipality, chairman of the general council or manager of a business, the decision-maker must use his powers to monitor the respect of laws in place, either by obeying legal obligations or by monitoring the compliance of his subordinates.

If the moral element of the infraction no doubt belongs to the person who commits it, since the delegate has no autonomy, the perception of the material element is more problematic. If the decider had respected the law, he would have ordered the subordinate to act or not to act in a certain way; he would not have respected the restrictions of regulation but he would have had them respected by a subaltern. When they have not been respected the decision-maker appears not as a material author of the infraction but as a moral author, almost an accomplice. Often applied to infractions of omission, nonetheless, the distinction between a material author and one who simply had an offending desire is tenuous.

This is why one can reproach the director who was to respect and enforce the applicable rules of failing to do so. If the infraction was apparently committed by a third subordinate, the decider is indeed responsible for not having acted. This responsibility of the decider does not violate the principle of responsibility for personal actions. It also does not exonerate the subordinate of his own responsibility if the elements of an infraction can be imputed to him.

As well, the decider in principle must submit proof of his absence of fault, even if this proof would in practice be difficult to produce: the decider is assumed to know the rules that apply to his activity and is most often blamed for not respecting them or ensuring they are respected. Example: a mayor is personally guilty of favoritism because he set the agenda and presided over the meeting of the municipal council that violated legal restrictions (Crim. 19 novembre 2003).

When the decision-maker in fact is not the decision-maker in law, the Court of cassation adopts a solution similar to that of the civil jurisdictions in similar circumstances: the decision-makers are co-authors of the infraction, and each can be pursued as if he were the only decider (Crim. 12 septembre 2000).

The judicial administrator of a company, invested with the powers of the executive, also assumes his responsibility and qualities.

It has nonetheless appeared that in large hierarchies &lt;!--important (structures) --&gt; the decider is not in practice responsible for the entirety of the business' activities. Worse, the decider cannot materially meet all the obligations that weigh on him: the head of an enterprise should constantly pay heed that safety instructions are being followed by workers, the rules of accounting and billing by the accounting department, labor laws are followed by the personnel office, and the rules of sanitation by the maintenance and upkeep departments… it does not seem either just or opportune to impute to him an infraction when the power of decision lay with a third party.

This is the mechanism of delegation of power.

==== Delegation of power ====
The criminal responsibility of the decision-maker is tied to the powers he holds over the functioning of the enterprise: these are the powers which allow him to be reproached with not acting, or with allowing an infraction to be committed.

One cannot disassociate this responsibility from the qualities of the powers of the decision-maker. As a result, the delegation of power also carries with it onto this third party the attendant criminal responsibility. This logical solution was endorsed by the Cour de cassation from the very start of the 20th century (28 juin 1902).

Delegation of power is a consensual act between a delegating decision-maker and a delegatee subordinate; writing is useful only as proof. One can imagine subdelegations with the same conditions of dans les mêmes conditions of validity and effectiveness as the initial delegation. On the other hand, any co-delegation is ruled out: the delegate must enjoy an autonomy and power incompatible with the collective exercise of delegation.

La validity and effectiveness of the delegation of powers depend on several criteria brought out in the case law:

a. Delegation only exonerates of the responsibility in that capacity: in no case can a decider who personally took part in the consummation of an infraction avail himself of delegation. The decision-maker who personally takes part in the infraction is responsible for his personal actions and like any material author of the infraction he can be punished. Only the responsibility incurred by failing to fulfil the obligations specifically incumbent on his functions can benefit from delegation of powers.
Example : Crim. 17 septembre 2002, aggressive sales strategies, an element of fraud, remain imputable to the decision-maker despite the delegation of power, since he conceived and organized the strategies himself.

b. Delegation of powers is made necessary by the structure of the enterprise: only the decision-maker who cannot effectively assume his legal obligations can delegate his responsibilities to a third party. The mechanism of delegation of powers is not a means for the decision-maker to escape his criminal responsibility, but a mechanism to assure the effectiveness of legal limitations. It's when the scale or material organization of an enterprise do not allow a decision-maker to confront his obligations that delegation of power is authorized and even desirable. In the same spirit delegation cannot be general but must concern a precise sector of activity. This special character the delegation is strictly interpreted by judges.

Example: Crim. 14 octobre 2003, the delegation of power in hygiene and security to an administrator, president of the Committee of Hygiene Security and Work Conditions (CHSCT), the mandated committee in every workplace, does not transfer the responsibility for not consulting CHSCT: an interference has been committed by the company decision-maker. The Court of Cassation seems to distinguish "technical" delegation in matters of hygiene and security, concrete, and a delegation of judicial or administrative obligations tied to the functioning of the CHSCT.

c. The delegate is a member of the enterprise provided with the competence, authority, and necessary means: the decision-maker must designate one of his subordinates or possibly the head of a daughter organization in a group of companies who has the technical competence, authority and material means permitting him, in practice, to bring to a successful conclusion the mission assigned to him by the delegation.

These conditions are to avoid fictitious delegations. For a subordinate to assume the criminal responsibility attached to certain responsibilities, the decision-maker must have put him in a position to effectively ensure the respect of the law. The decider who proceeds to a judicial delegation without effectively transmitting his powers will remain responsible in that capacity for the delegated matter.

The finding of the existence and regularity of a delegation of powers assures stems from the sovereign power of lower-court judges, who often show themselves rather severe with deciders, distrusting fictive delegations: Crim 10 septembre 2002, for example, in a matter of asbestos which finds the general delegation of organization and supervision of construction site safety.

The effect of this responsibility in that capacity associated to the mechanism of the delegation of power is to give decision-makers a real duty to delegate their responsibilities as soon as they cannot assume them themselves, which ensures an maximum effectiveness of the regulation of their activity.

==== RPPM ====
To trigger the criminal responsibility of a corporation as author, the infraction must have been committed on behalf of the corporation by its agent or representative.

It's the mechanism for criminal responsibility by ricochet.

The corporation is not considered in criminal law as an autonomous person endowed with his or her power of decision and methods of action, but rather an abstract person incarnated by its representatives or agents.

RPPM is a mechanism that imputes to the corporation the offenses of one or more physical persons: the representative or the agent, in other words persons with the legal, statutory of conventional power to engage the corporation, and notably the delegate of a representative with the ability, authority and means  necessary to perform this mission.

An infraction committed by a stranger to the corporation, and sometimes by acts foreign to the scope of representation, or a crime which is not committed on behalf of the corporation (i.e. in its interest or in its name) cannot be imputed to it.

Imputation of an infraction to a corporation supposes the elements of the crime are present, and is more often done to physical people à une personne morale suppose la réunion de tous les éléments de l'infraction, le plus souvent sur la tête d'une personne physique identifiée, organe ou représentant de la personne morale.
Les juges ne peuvent en aucun cas établir l'existence des éléments de l'infraction directement dans le chef de la personne morale (Crim. 29 avril 2003).

A finding of non-responsibility for a representative or an agent in theory prevents the prosecution of corporations, even, it seems, in the case of a subjective cause of non-responsibility, a personal attributes of the agent such as demential, even though the solution is unclear in law.

A corporation constitutes an autonomous entity with a different judicial personality from that of its constituent parts. As, in theory, nothing allows applying to a person a subjective cause of non-responsibility applicable to a third party, il ne semble pas opportun de contrevenir à ce mécanisme dans l'hypothèse d'une personne morale, sauf à rompre l'égalité des justiciables devant la loi pénale.

The disappearance of the corporation naturally puts an end to prosecution, this even in the case of merger or acquisition. The principle of responsibility for personal actions runs counter to the acquiring entity or person of responsibility for infractions committed by the acquired business (Crim. 14 octobre 2003).

== Causes of criminal non-responsibility ==
If the author of an infraction has a cause for a finding of non-responsibility, he will not be condemned due to his absence of responsibility, even if the facts that constitute the infraction are established and guilt recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fxrd.blogspirit.com/archive/2008/02/15/les-faits-justificatifs.html|title=LES FAITS JUSTIFICATIFS|website=fxrd.blogspirit.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctrine, like jurisprudence, operates a distinction that does not appear in the penal code among the objective causes of not-responsible findings, or justifying facts, or the subjective causes of non-responsibility, or non-imputability.

=== Objective causes of non-responsibility (justifying facts) ===
Objective causes of penal non-responsibility, also called justifying facts, erase the punishable nature of the act.  The impunity of the principal actor extends thereafter to the accomplice as well as the corporation.

Justifying facts are of three types:
*authorisation of the law, or order from a legitimate authority (article 122-4&lt;ref name="codes-et-lois 122-4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-122-4|title=Code pénal – Article 122-4|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*legitimate defense (articles 122-5&lt;ref name="codes-et-lois 122-5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-122-5|title=Code pénal – Article 122-5|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; et 122-6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-122-6|title=Code pénal – Article 122-6|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; )
*state of necessity (article 122-7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-122-7|title=Code pénal – Article 122-7|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==== Authorisation of the law, order from a legitimate authority ====
The authorisation of law or regulation reveals a contradiction between a criminal law text and another law text, whether it contains civil, administrative or penal law. Authorisation of regulation can only justify regulatory contraventions  and not violations of criminal law, as much because of the hierarchy of norms as because of the separation of the executive, legislative and judicial powers.

The liberal principle would have us believe that interdiction is always the exception when it comes to liberty, so authorisation in law must always weigh heavier than the prohibitions of a different law of the same type (valeur=value).

The most recent applications of the justifying facts concern use of force by the police and by the ''gendarmerie,'' medical acts, which are not qualified as violent if they are the acts of physicians and have a therapeutic motive. Also article 73 of the Code of penal procedure, which allows any citizen to arrest the author of a crime or misdemeanor punishable by a sentence of imprisonment, and to restrain that person until police arrive.

On January 5, 2000, the [[Cour de cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]] indicated that the justifying facts defense of authorization  under law extends to involuntary infractions committed in the course of the execution of an act authorized by law, for example, clumsiness of a ''gendarme'' caused the death of the person he was lawfully pursuing.

This assumes, of course that the criteria to apply that authorization to the given situation were all in place, and that it was absolutely necessary for example for the ''gendarme'' to use his weapon, Crim. 18 February 2003.

This decision confirms that [[authorization|authorisation]] of law is not a subjective cause of non-responsibility; authorization does not make the moral element disappear, or else imprudence would remain punishable.

Authorisation under low can only cover exactly the facts detailed as authorized in the legislation. Also, the duty de cohabitation which mandates spouses to maintain sexual relations doesn't authorize one of them to impose sexual relations on the other. The right to arrest and restrain the author of a flagrant misdemeanor does not permit molesting, searching or questioning him before the polica arrive.

Nor does an administrative notice, or autorisation to perfourrm an activity justify a violation of criminal law. Apparently the administrative authorities do not have the power to allow a behavior to escape from the scope of criminal law.

The Cour de cassation has found that the duty to assist a person in danger described in article 223-6 of the ''Code pénal'' did not justify the assistance given a miscreant by a nurse, once the services provided to him went beyond strictly necessary assistance required by the endangerment of the miscreant (Crim. 17 septembre 2003).

À l'autorisation de la loi, il convient d'associer la coutume qui permet des atteintes légères à la personne humaine sans que leur auteur puisse être inquiété : ainsi, le droit de correction des parents sur leur enfant, la pratique de sports violents ou la possibilité de réaliser des piercings et ou des tatouages sans être poursuivi pour violences volontaires.

==== Legitimate defense ====
Legitimate defense is provided by article 122-5&lt;ref name="codes-et-lois 122-5" /&gt; of the penal code. This justifying fact benefits the person who, faced with an unjust and current attack against a person or a good, carries out a necessary, simultaneous and proportionate act in defense of that person or that good.

The elements of a legitimate defense are as follows:
* an unjust attack against oneself, others, or an asset. The unjust nature of the attack notably excludes legitimate violence like a policeman trying to protect the public order, or licit behaviours like confisating GMO corn.
* A concurrent attack, in other words, fighting back at the time of the attack. It is impossible to avail oneself of a legitimate defense argument for an act of  vengeance, for example where a victim fires at an aggressor who is already running away. On the other hand, a defense prepared in advance (setting traps, electric fences) is valid as long as the defensive measures do not execute until there is an actual attack.
* necessary retaliation: in other words, to counter the attack, commission of an illicit act is necessary; there is no legal alternative to the retaliation.
* a response proportionate to the attack: the value sacrificed must be less than the value protected; the reply must engender a lower social cost than if the attack had been carried out.

Jurisprudence has been able to clarify the conditions for laying a legitimate defense argument.

The actual and unjust character of the attack poses no serious application problem. When the attack is an action of a public authority, its injustice may be perceived in cases of manifest illegality (beatings and night raids).

The necessary and proportionate character of the response is itself subject to the assessment of lower-court juges, and in function of the entirety of the circumstances of fact. The [[Court of Cassation]] decisions of 6 December 1995 et 21 February 1996 reveal a victim seized by the collar found guilty for having responded with blows from sharp claws but recognized as a legitimate defense for shooting a bullet into heart of the aggressor.

In many affairs that take place at night, it can be seen that determining the necessary and proportionate character of the response does not depend on the reality of the aggression, but rather on its gravity as perceived by the author of the ''riposte''.

Rather than ponder the balance of interests that are really in play, the penal judge asks himself whether a reasonable person placed in the same situation would have reacted in the same way.

This subjective  approach, which can lead to a finding of an admissibility for a purely putative claim of legitimate defense, in reaction to an imaginary aggression, explains the refusal to justify as legitimate defense involuntary infractions. A prudent man can control his actions and responds in a proportionate manner to an aggression of which he is victim; he will not commit any imprudent or negligeant acts bringing about the wounding or death of his aggressor.

This approach also justifies denying the benefit of legitimate defense to one who does not know he is in a defensive position: for example, a person who joins a brawl for the pleasure of fighting and who by chance becomes part of a group of victims in a state of legitimate defense. Legitimate defense would protect someone who while committing an illicit act does not commit a fault, or who reveals his lack of social dangerousness.

==== Necessity ====
A state of necessity is a true justifying fact, which covers even involuntary infractions: ''Crim. 16 juillet 1986'' found a ''gendarme'' not criminally responsible for a bullet shot into the ground because he needed to intimidate someone, which wounded that person in a ricochet.

The determining criteria for the state of necessity to enter into play may be the balance between the protected interest and the sacrificed interest, as two arrests in the criminal chamber on May 11, 2004 . In this case (''appeal n° 03-80.254''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=French|title=cass. crim. 11 mai 2004, pourvoi n° 03-80.254|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000007065989|website=Légifrance|date=11 May 2004|accessdate=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the guilty verdict of trial court judges of  Sangachali-Duvanni on theft charges was overturned because the fraudulently-seized documents were to be used to defend of the accused in litigation with her employer. The upper court (Haute jurisdiction) effectively found that on the one hand the strictly necessary character of the documents to the defense of the prosecuted person was not researched by the lower-court judges, given that the theft of the documents was carried out only in the intention of "legitimately preserving proofs" in the context of a lawsuit. The appeals court confirmed the same day in another case (appeal  n° 03-85.521&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=French|title=Cour de Cassation, Chambre criminelle, du 11 mai 2004, 03-80.254, (cass. crim. 11 mai 2004 pourvoi n° 03-85.521)|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?oldAction=rechJuriJudi&amp;idTexte=JURITEXT000007071415&amp;fastReqId=39416319&amp;fastPos=1|website=Légifrance|date=11 May 2004|accessdate=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;) the acquittal of a person prosecuted on a charge of theft.

=== Subjective causes of non-responsibility (non-imputability) ===

==== Coercion ====
[[Duress|Coercion]] is the penal equivalent of ''force majeure''. It is an irresistible force. As in civil law, a debate exists concerning unforeseeability—is this a  condition for the implementation of the idea or is it a corollary of irresistibility, foreseeable events being by nature resistible? The criminal chamber has required that the constraint be unforeseeable and irresistible. The law, however, mentions only irresistibility.

Coercion can be physical or moral; the important criteria are its irresistible characture and its causal tie to the crime. Coercion is a cause of non-imputability, but it must have abolished the discernment of the victim to be taken into account.

This could take the form of a natural disaster of an illness of the actor: a driver who becomes unwell due to an illness he did not know he had, exonerates him of all criminal responsibility for the consequences of the accident he may have caused.

The classical example of a moral coercion is coercion which results from pressure or blackmail which has abolished the discernment of the victim. The Court of cassation has been able to find that the alleged pressure of the German authorities on the person of [[Maurice Papon]] did not abolish his free will and he, therefore, remained responsible for his complicity in crimes against humanity (Crim. 23 janvier 1997).

The coercion will not be taken into account if results from a fault or an imprudence of the person who acts. Thus, a person who knows himself subject to unwellness but who drives anyway, or who dozes off after starting a trip in an advanced state of fatigue, are responsible for homicide or involuntary wounding if they cause an accident.

==== Legal error ====
"Nemo censetur ignorare legem" (None should be ignorant of the law): the adage supplies a [[legal fiction]] (not a presumption or simple [[evidence (law)|proof]]) which is necessary to the functions of all judicial systems.

Law rests on its compulsory character and one cannot envisage a judicial system in which individuals could avail themshelves of their ignorance of the law to escape its application.

When the penal code was reformed the lawmakers attempted to satisfy the imperatives of clarity and accessibility and list possible infractions ''hors code'', outside the code, in the fifth book of the penal code. It appears that it was impossible to enumerate the entirety of the offenses extant and active in French law, but their numbers are estimated at 10,000.

This impossibility to know the exact contours of criminal law has led legislators to attenuate the fiction of knowledge of law by the introduction of error of law as a cause of non-responsibility. Article 122-3 of the penal code provides for the non-responsibility of a person who can prove having believed, by an error of law he could not avoid, that he could legitimately carry out the action in question. It is not so much a matter of proving one's ignorance of criminal law as it is of proving one's belief in the legality of the action in question.

The Court of Cassation has applied this cause of non-responsibility in a very restricted manner, finding for example that the error on the scope of a court decision caused by the legal counsel of the party is not necessarily an invincible defense, since the judge could be asked to interpret it ''(Crim. 11 octobre 1995)''. It has equally found that a company which had expanded its market after a (ministériel) indicated that it did not need an authorization had not committed an invincible error, because it could have consulted qualified jurists ''(Crim. 19 mars 1997)''.
It later formulated the principle that simple advice from a law professional does not constitute an error of law (Crim. 7 janvier 2004).

The court has accepted the non-responsibility of a head of an enterprise who merely applies a collective bargaining agreement signed under the aegis of a mediator designated by the government (Crim. 24 novembre 1998).

This cause of non-responsibility is used more widely by lower courts, generally censured by the Court of cassation, due to equity concerns. For example, the Paris Court of Appeals held that the mismatch between the case law of the  business and criminal chambers of the Court of cassation as to the legality of the documents photocopied by employees in order to produce them in justice had led the employee to an error of law preventing a guilty verdict for theft (''CA Paris, 9 novembre 2000, Crim.11 mai 2004'').

Beyond these three subjective causes of non-responsibility, immunities exist that stem from the personal qualities of the defendant, such as the application of Article 311-12 of the Code pénal, immunity of spouses, ascendant et descendant in matters of theft. Such immunities are personal causes of non-responsibility which do not apply to the accomplice or to the corporation; they are nonetheless not the same as a lack of moral elements and in this they approach the objective causes of non-responsibility.

==== Mental disturbance or dementia ====
Article 122-1 of the ''Code pénal'' says that a person "afflicted at the moment in question by a psychic or neuropsychic disturbance that abolishes his discernment or his control of his actions" will not be found criminally responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=French|title=Chapitre II: Des causes d'irresponsabilité ou d'atténuation de la responsabilité|publisher=Légifrance|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=1E70007035452E506E3984590E742BE1.tpdila14v_3?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006149818&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20150515|website=légifrance.gouv.fr|date=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the moment when the psychic or neuropsychic trouble declared itself, the person's charges could be dismissed by the  juge d'instruction, or receive an acquittal or not-guilty verdict in the trial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|language=French|title=L'irresponsabilité pénale des malades mentaux|trans-title=Lack of criminal responsibility in the mentally ill|url=http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc132/lc132_mono.html|website=senat.fr/|date=|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the person is considered a danger to society because of his mental disturbance, he can be committed to a mental institution. The prefect (préfet) decides what to do with the person in this case.&lt;ref name="sénat lc132"&gt;{{Cite web|language=French|title=L'irresponsabilité pénale des malades mentaux|url=http://www.senat.fr/lc/lc132/lc132_mono.html|website=senat.fr|accessdate=15 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminal responsibility of French politicians ==

=== Parliamentarians ===
In France, deputies and senators have parliamentary immunity which comes down to non-responsibility (fundamental immunity) and inviolability (immunity of procedure).

=== Local elected officials ===
Local elected officials in 1974 gained a jurisdictional privilege, notably prefects and magistrates. Instituted following the 5/7 dance hall fire and the subsequent  sentencing of then-mayor of [[Saint-Laurent-du-Pont]],  which made a powerful impression on the political class. This privilege allowed the investigation of crimes and misdemeanors of elected officials in another jurisdiction than their own, to avoid any partiality on the part of the judge, and was abolished with the reform of the penal code in 1993.

The implementation of decentralization has led to significant growth in 20-some years of the body of standards (more than 5,000 texts spread through 18 Codes) to which elected officials are subject, sometimes without having the means, especially in small municipalities, of applying them in practice. The areas of urban design, the environment, and the security of the financial markets are so many "infraction niches". Also, legislators have created unintentional misdemeanors, a straying from the principle that says "there is no crime of offence without the intention of committing it" (art. 121-3&lt;ref name="codes-et-lois 121-3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codes-et-lois.fr/code-penal/article-121-3|title=Code pénal – Article 121-3|website=www.codes-et-lois.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; of penal code). Finally, in the context of an economic crisis and of competition between towns to attract businesses, some mayors have been brought to make perilous judicial combinations (''montages'').

Mayors may have felt like the "scapegoats of proximity democracy," in the words of Senator [[Hubert Haenel]], forced to limit their initiatives. So legislation therefore attempted to better frame the phenomenon, notably with the ''Fauchon'' law of July 10, 2000, on unintended misdemeanors (…).&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Christine Steckel, « Plaidoyer pour une dépénalisation des fautes non intentionnelles des élus locaux », Revue juridique – Droit prospectif, 2002, n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 1, pp. 427–447&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy [[Étienne Mourrut]] introduced a law concerning the criminal liability of elected local officials in sports or cultural demonstrations.

{{Hinduism}}

'''Devarishi''' ([[Sanskrit]]: देवर्षि) means – 'the celestial sage'; it is one of the three categories of [[Rishi]]s, the other two being – ''[[Brahmarishi]]'' (ब्रह्मर्षि) and ''[[Rajarishi]]'' (राजर्षि).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=492|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.1.apte.2546753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rajarishis'' were those [[Kshatriya]] kings who gained the status of Rishi; the difference between a ''Rishi'' and a ''Brahmarishi'' was that of the degree of penance and accomplishment, and their life-span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rishis &amp; Rishikas|author=Shrikant Prasoon|publisher=Pustak Mahal|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=SSammk5xUUEC&amp;pg=PT64&amp;dq=devarishi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KKyGVOGKFYSIuASV7oK4Dg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=devarishi&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vayu Purana|Vāyu Purāņa]] (LXI.79-92) tells us that the root - ऋष, from which the word ऋषि (''[[Rishi]]'') is derived, is used in the sense of motion (Knowledge), hearing truth and austerity, and gives the marks of a ''Devarishi''. It states that seers living in the celestial regions should be known as the blessed ''Devarishis'', and also those who are distinguished by their knowledge of the past, present and future and strict adherence to truth; they are the revealers of ''[[Mantra]]'' and by virtue of their ''[[Siddhi]]s'' ('supernatural powers') have unrestricted access everywhere. The same text earlier states that:-

:देवर्षी धर्मपुत्रौ तु नरनारायणावुभौ |
:वालखिल्याः क्रतोः पुत्राः कर्दमः पुलहस्य तु ||
:पर्वतो नारदश्चैव कश्यपस्यात्मजावुभौ |

the two sons of Dharma, [[Nara-Narayana|Nara and Nārāyaņa]]; [[Prajapati|Kratu]]’s sons, collectively known as Vālakhilyas; Kardama, son of Pulaha; Parvata, [[Narada|Nārada]] and the two sons of [[Kasyapa|Kaśyapa]], Asita and Vatsara, are called ''Devarishis'' because they can exercise control even over the celestials. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandka|publisher=Gita Press|page=454,455|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Srimadbhagavadgita.html?id=NFWHMwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}
[[File:Down shifting on the Rogue.jpg|thumb|275x275px|An example of what a down shifting lifestyle may allow more time for.]]
The term down-shifting in the English language refers to the act of reducing the gear of a motor vehicle while driving a [[manual transmission]]. This title or term has now been re purposed and applied to describe a [[social behavior]] or [[Social Trends|trend]] in which individuals live simpler lives to escape from what critics call the [[rat race]].

The long-term effect of downshifting can include an escape from what has been described as [[economic materialism]], as well as reduce the "stress and psychological expense that may accompany [[economic materialism]]". This new social trend emphasizes finding an improved [[Work–life balance|balance between leisure and work]], while also focusing life goals on personal fulfillment, as well as building personal relationships instead of the all-consuming pursuit of economic success.

Down-shifting, as a concept, shares many characteristics with [[simple living]]. However, it is distinguished as an alternative form by its focus on moderate change and concentration on an individual comfort level and a gradual approach to living.&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"&gt;Tracey Smith, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, this new form of simple living began appearing in the [[mainstream media]], and has continually grown in popularity among populations living in [[Industrial society|industrial societies]], especially the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, p. 67;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Values and motives==
Down-shifters are people that adopt long-term [[voluntary simplicity]] in their lives. A few of the main practices of down-shifters include accepting less money for fewer hours worked, while placing an emphasis on consuming less in order to reduce their ecological footprint.  One of the main results of these practices is being able to enjoy more [[Leisure|leisure time]] in the company of others, especially loved ones.  

The primary motivations for downshifting are gaining leisure time, escaping from [[consumerism|work-and-spend cycle]], and removing the clutter of unnecessary possessions. The personal goals of downshifting are simple:  To reach a holistic self-understanding and satisfying meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;Levy 2005, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its personalized nature and emphasis on many minor changes, rather than complete lifestyle overhaul, it attracts downshifters or participants across the socioeconomic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Both of Hamilton's case studies in 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  An intrinsic consequence of downshifting is increased time for non-work-related activities, which, combined with the diverse demographics of downshifters, cultivates higher levels of [[civic engagement]] and [[Social relation|social interaction]].&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, p. 142"&gt;Nelson 2007, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope of participation is limitless, because all members of society &amp;mdash; adults, children, businesses, institutions, organizations, and governments &amp;mdash; are able to downshift.&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"/&gt;

In practice, down-shifting involves a variety of [[behavior change (public health)|behavioral and lifestyle changes]]. The majority of these down-shifts are voluntary choices. Natural life course events, such as the loss of a job, or birth of a child can prompt involuntary down-shifting. There is also a [[Time|temporal dimension]], because a down-shift could be either temporary or permanent.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"&gt;Schor 1998, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==

===Work and income===
The most common form of down-shifting is work (or income) down-shifting. Down-shifting is fundamentally based on dissatisfaction with the conditions and consequences of the workplace environment.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;  The philosophy of work-to-live replaces the social [[ideology]] of live-to-work. Reorienting economic priorities shifts the [[work–life balance]] away from the workplace.

Economically, work downshifts are defined in terms of reductions in either actual or potential [[income]], work hours, and spending levels.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  Following a path of earnings that is lower than the established market path is a downshift in potential earnings in favor of gaining other non-material benefits.

On an individual level, work downshifting is a voluntary reduction in annual income. Downshifters desire meaning in life outside of work and, therefore, will opt to decrease the amount of time spent at work or work hours.  Reducing the number of hours of work, consequently, lowers the amount earned.&lt;ref&gt;Schor 1998, pps. 66-69&lt;/ref&gt;  Simply not working [[overtime]] or taking a half-day a week for leisure time, are work downshifts.

Career downshifts are another way of downshifting economically and entail lowering previous aspirations of [[wealth]], a promotion or higher [[social status]].&lt;ref&gt;Juniu 2000, p. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;  Quitting a job to work locally in the community, from home or to start a business are examples of career downshifts.  Although more radical, these changes do not mean stopping work altogether.

Many reasons are cited by workers for this choice and usually center on a personal [[cost–benefit analysis]] of current working situations and the quality extracurricular activities. High stress, pressure from employers to increase productivity, and long [[Commuting|commutes]] can be factors that contribute to the costs of being employed.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  If the down-shifter wants more [[quality time|non-material benefits]] like leisure time, a healthy family life, or personal freedom, then, switching jobs could be a desirable option.

Work down-shifting may also be a key to considerable [[Health#Maintaining|health benefit]]s as well as a healthy [[retirement]]. People are retiring later in life than previous generations. We can see by looking at The Health and Retirement Study,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu|title=Welcome to the Health and Retirement Study|website=hrsonline.isr.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; done by the Health and Retirement Study Survey Research Center, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gustman|first=Alan|last2=Mitchell|first2=Olivia|last3=Steinmeier|first3=Thomas|date=1994-08|title=Retirement Research Using the Health and Retirement Survey|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3386/w4813|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;women can show the long term [[Health#Maintaining|health benefits]] of down-shifting their work lives by working part time hours over a long period of years. Men however prove to be more unhealthy if they work part time from [[middle age]] till [[Retirement age|retirement]]. Men that down-shift their work life to part time hours at the age of 60 to 65 however benefit from continuing to work a part time job through a semi retirement even over the age of 70. This is an example of how flexible working policies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Suzan|last2=Roper|first2=Ian|date=2009-09-02|title=Flexible Working Arrangements: From Work–Life to Gender Equity Policies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199234738.003.0018|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199234738.003.0018}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be a key to being healthy while in retirement. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDonough|first=Peggy|last2=Worts|first2=Diana|last3=Corna|first3=Laurie M.|last4=McMunn|first4=Anne|last5=Sacker|first5=Amanda|date=2017-12|title=Later-life employment trajectories and health|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2017.09.002|journal=Advances in Life Course Research|volume=34|pages=22–33|doi=10.1016/j.alcr.2017.09.002|issn=1040-2608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spending habits===
Another aspect of down-shifting is being a [[Ethical consumerism|conscious consumer]] or actively practicing alternative forms of consumption. Proponents of down-shifting point to [[consumerism]] as a primary source of stress and dissatisfaction because it creates a society of individualistic consumers who measure both social status and general happiness by an [[affluenza|unattainable quantity of material possessions]]. Instead of buying goods for personal satisfaction, consumption down-shifting, purchasing only the necessities, is a way to focus on quality of life rather than quantity.&lt;ref name="Nelson 2007, p. 142"/&gt;

This realignment of spending priorities promotes the functional utility of goods over their ability to convey status which is evident in downshifters being, in general, less [[brand]]-conscious.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson 2007, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; These consumption habits also facilitate the option of working and earning less because annual spending is proportionally lower. Reducing spending is less demanding than more extreme downshifts in other areas, like employment, as it requires only minor lifestyle changes.

===Policies that enable downshifting===
Unions, business, and governments could implement more [[Flextime|flexible working hours]], [[Part-time contract|part-time]] work, and other non-traditional work arrangements that enable people to work less, while still maintaining employment. Small business legislation, reduced filing requirements and reduced tax rates encourage small-scale individual [[entrepreneurship]] and therefore help individuals quit their jobs altogether and work for themselves on their own terms.&lt;ref name=GreenIllusions&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln and London|url=http://www.greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment consequences===
The catch-phrase of International Downshifting Week is "Slow Down and Green Up".&lt;ref name="Tracey Smith, 2008"/&gt;  Whether intentional or unintentional, generally, the choices and practices of down-shifters nurture environmental health because they reject the fast-paced lifestyle fueled by [[Fossil fuel|fossil fuels]] and adopt more sustainable lifestyles. The [[Manifest and latent functions and dysfunctions|latent function]] of consumption down-shifting is to reduce, to some degree, the [[carbon footprint]] of the individual down-shifter.  An example is to shift from a corporate suburban rat race lifestyle to a small eco friendly farming lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444327204577615972288993492 ''The Ultimate Growth Business; Many corporate refugees think green acres are the place to be. How do they make the transition?]'' October 12, 2012 ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Down-shifting geographically===
As a response the hectic pace of life and stresses in urban areas, downshifting geographically is a relocation to a smaller, rural, or more slow-paced community.&lt;ref name="Schor 1998, p. 68"/&gt;  This is a more drastic change, but because the access to the internet is widespread and possible, downshifting geographically does not bring total removal from mainstream culture.

==Sociopolitical implications==
Although downshifting is primarily motivated by personal desire and not by a conscious political stance, it does define societal [[overconsumption]] as the source of much personal discontent. By redefining life satisfaction in non-material terms, downshifters assume an alternative lifestyle but continue to coexist in a society and political system preoccupied with the economy. In general, downshifters are politically apathetic because mainstream politicians mobilize voters through the ''hip-pocket nerve'', proposing governmental solutions to periods of financial hardship and [[recession|economic recessions]]. This economic rhetoric is meaningless to downshifters who have forgone worrying about money.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Jan. 2003, pps. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Although consumers do hold the majority in the United States, the UK, and Australia, a significant minority, approximately 20 to 25 percent,&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Both 2003 Studies&lt;/ref&gt; of these countries' citizens identify themselves in some respect as downshifters. Downshifting is not an isolated or unusual choice.  Politics still centers around consumerism and unrestricted growth, but downshifting value, such as family priorities and workplace regulation, are appearing in political debates and campaigns.

Like downshifters, the [[The Cultural Creatives|Cultural Creatives]] is another social movement whose ideology and practices diverge from mainstream [[consumerism]] and according to Paul Ray, are followed by at least a quarter of U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Nov. 2003, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''In Praise of Slowness'', Carl Honoré relates followers of downshifting and [[simple living]] to the global [[Slow movement (culture)|Slow Movement]].

The emergence of a large and diverse class of downshifters challenges the economically bias ideas for improving society.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Nov. 2003, pps. 35-37&lt;/ref&gt;  Downshifting and similar, [[Post-materialism|post-materialist]] ideologies are rising in popularity, but as a result of their [[grassroots]] nature, and relatively inconspicuous, non-confrontational subcultures, they represent unorganized [[List of social movements|social movements]] without political aspirations or motivating grievances.

[[File:Garrote Execution - 1901.png|thumb|A 1901 execution at the old Bilibid Prison, [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]]]
A '''garrote''' or '''garrote vil''' (a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word; alternative spellings include '''garotte''' and similar variants&lt;ref name=COED&gt;''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary|Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 11th Ed: '''garrotte''' is normal British English spelling, with single r alternate. Article title is US English spelling variant.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[weapon]], most often a handheld [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]] of chain, rope, scarf, wire or fishing line used to [[Strangling|strangle]] a person.&lt;ref name=NEW&gt;Newquist, H.P. and Maloof, Rich, ''This Will Kill You: A Guide to the Ways in Which We Go'', New York: St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|978-0-312-54062-3}} (2009), pp. 133-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination weapon==
[[File:Fomfr garrote.jpg|thumb|From the torture museum of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]]]
A garrote can be made out of many different materials, including ropes, [[cable tie]]s, fishing lines, nylon, guitar strings, telephone cord or [[piano wire]].&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHI&gt;Whittaker, Wayne, ''Tough Guys'', Popular Mechanics, February 1943, Vol. 79 No. 2, pp. 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=STE&gt;Steele, David E., ''Silent Sentry Removal'', Black Belt Magazine, August 1986, Vol. 24 No. 8, pp. 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

A stick may be used to tighten the garrote; the Spanish word actually refers to the stick itself, so it is a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' where the eponymous component may actually be absent. In Spanish, the term may also refer to a rope and stick used to constrict a limb as a torture device.&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt;&lt;ref name=DRAE&gt;''[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=garrote#0_7 garrote]'', 7th sense, ''[[Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since World War II, the garrote has been regularly employed as a weapon by soldiers as a silent means of killing sentries and other enemy personnel.&lt;ref name=WHI/&gt;&lt;ref name=STE/&gt; Instruction in the use of purpose-built and improvised garrottes is included in the training of many elite military units and special forces.&lt;ref name=STE/&gt; A typical military garrote consists of two wooden handles attached to a length of flexible wire; the wire is looped over a sentry's head and pulled taut in one motion.&lt;ref name=WHI/&gt;&lt;ref name=STE/&gt; Soldiers of the [[French Foreign Legion]] have used a particular type of double-loop garrote (referred to as ''la loupe''), where a double coil of rope or cord is dropped around a victim's neck and then pulled taut. Even if the victim pulls on one of the coils, he only succeeds in tightening the other.&lt;ref name=STE/&gt;

The garrote was widely employed in 17th- and 18th-century India as an assassination device, particularly by the [[Thuggee]] cult.&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt; Practitioners used a yellow silk or cloth scarf called a [[rumāl]].&lt;ref name=NEW/&gt; The Indian version of the garrote frequently incorporates a knot at the center intended to aid in crushing the [[larynx]] while someone applies pressure to the victim's back, usually with a foot or knee.

==Execution device==
[[File:Pedro_Berruguete_Saint_Dominic_Presiding_over_an_Auto-da-fe_1495.jpg|thumb|In this 15th-century depiction of the burning of [[Albigensian]]s after an ''[[auto da fe]]'', the condemned had been garroted previously. It is one of the first depictions of a garrote. [[Pedro Berruguete]], ''[[Saint Dominic]] Presiding over an Auto-da-fe.'']]
The garrote ({{lang-la|laqueus}}) is known to have been used in the first century BC in Rome. It is referred to in accounts of the [[Catiline#Second Catilinian Conspiracy|Second Catilinian Conspiracy]], where conspirators including [[Publius Cornelius Lentulus Sura]] were strangled with a ''laqueus'' in the [[Mamertine Prison|Tullianum]], and the implement is shown in some early reliefs, e.g., ''Répertoire de Reliefs grecs et romains'', tome I, p.&amp;nbsp;341 (1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediterranees.net/civilisation/Rich/Articles/Supplices/Laqueus.html|title=Laqueus|publisher=Mediterranees.net|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in the [[Middle Ages]] in Spain and Portugal. It was employed during the ''[[Spanish colonization of the Americas|conquista]]'' of the Americas, notably in the execution of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] emperor [[Atahualpa]].

In the [[Ottoman Empire]], execution by strangulation was reserved for very high officials and members of the ruling family. Unlike the Spanish version, a bowstring was used instead of a tightening collar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AluFxq_GeLMC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=execution+by+the+bowstring|title=The Ottoman Empire: the classical ... - Google Books|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16|first=Halil|last=Inalcik|isbn=978-1-84212-442-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Peninsular War#Course of the war|Peninsular War]] of 1808–1814, French forces regularly used the garrote to execute Spanish ''guerrilleros'', priests, and other opponents of Napoleonic rule. Around 1810 the earliest known metallic garrote appeared in Spain, and on 28 April 1828, the garrote was declared the sole method of executing civilians in that country. In May 1897, the last public garroting in Spain was performed in [[Barcelona]]. After that, all executions were performed inside prisons. 

===Abolition===
The last civilian executions in Spain, both by garroting, were those of [[Pilar Prades]] in May 1959 and [[José María Jarabo]] in July 1959. Recent legislation had caused many crimes (such as robbery-murder) to fall under the jurisdiction of [[Military justice|military law]]; thus, prosecutors rarely requested civilian executions. Military executions were still performed in Spain until the 1970s. The garrotings of [[Heinz Chez]] (real name Georg Michael Welzel) and [[Salvador Puig Antich]] in March 1974, both convicted in the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist State]] of killing police officers, were the last state-sanctioned garrotings in Spain and in the world.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

With the 1973 Penal Code, [[prosecutor]]s once again started requesting execution in civilian cases. If the death penalty had not been abolished in 1978 after [[caudillo]] [[Francisco Franco]]'s death, it is most likely that civilian executions would have resumed.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The last man to be sentenced to death by garroting was [[José Luis Cerveto]] "el asesino de Pedralbes" in October 1977, for a double robbery–murder in May 1974.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Cerveto requested execution, but his sentence was [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]]. Another prisoner whose civilian death sentence was commuted was businessman Juan Ballot, for the [[contract killing]] of his wife in [[Navarre]] in November 1973.

In Spain, the death penalty was abolished after a new constitution was adopted in 1978. The writer [[Camilo José Cela]] obtained a garrote (which had probably been used for the execution of Puig Antich) from the ''[[General Council of the Judiciary|Consejo General del Poder Judicial]]'' to display at his foundation. The device was kept in storage in Barcelona. It was displayed in the room&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacioncela.com/asp/lasede/salas_pascualduarteI.asp|title=La Sede.

Exposiciones permanentes|publisher=Fundacioncela.com|date=|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Cela Foundation devoted to his novel ''[[The Family of Pascual Duarte|La familia de Pascual Duarte]]'' until Puig Antich's family asked for its removal.&lt;ref name=Voz&gt;[http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/ed_corunia/noticia.jsp?CAT=127&amp;TEXTO=5302415 El director de cine Manuel Huerga presenta el libro «Cómo se hizo: Salvador»]. ''[[La Voz de Galicia]]'', 21 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Andorra]] became the last country to officially abolish the death penalty by garrotting, though this method had not been employed there since the late 12th century.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Genchi Genbutsu'''''|現地現物}} means "Go and See” and it is a key principle of the [[Toyota Production System]]. It suggests that in order to truly understand a situation one needs to go to ''[[genba]]'' (現場) or, the "real place" - where work is done.

==Application==
[[Taiichi Ohno]], creator of the Toyota Production System is credited, perhaps apocryphally, with taking new graduates to the shopfloor and drawing a chalk circle on the floor. The graduate would be told to stand in the circle, observe and note what he saw. When Ohno returned he would check; if the graduate had not seen enough he would be asked to keep observing. Ohno was trying to imprint upon his future engineers that the only way to truly understand what happens on the shop floor was to go there. It was where value was added and waste could be observed. 

Genchi Genbutsu is therefore a key approach in problem solving. If the problem exists on the shop floor then it needs to be understood and solved at the shop floor. 

Genchi Genbutsu is also called [[Gemba]] attitude. Gemba is the Japanese term for "the place" in this case "the place where it actually happens". Since real value is created at the shop floor in manufacturing, this is where managers need to spend their time.

Genchi Genbutsu is sometimes referred to as "Getcha boots on" (and go out and see what is happening) due to its similar cadence and meaning. It has been compared to [[Tom Peters|Peters]] and [[Robert H. Waterman Jr|Waterman's]] idea of "[[Management By Wandering Around]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pmhut.com/management-by-wandering-around-mbwa | title = Management by Wandering Around | author= Noel W. Hinners |date = October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept quickly became so universal that new managers instinctively knew that they had to "walk around" to achieve high effectiveness levels. Whilst these ideas, with their associated lists of how-tos, are probably good ideas they may miss the essential nature of Genchi Genbutsu which is less to "visit" and more to "know" by being there. Toyota has high levels of management presence on the production line whose role is to "know" and to constantly improve.

== Implementation ==

"Gemba attitude" reflects the idea that whatever reports, measures and ideas are transmitted to management are only an abstraction of what is actually going on in the ''genba'' to create value. Metrics and reports will reflect the attitudes of the management questioner and the workplace responder as well as how the responder views the questioner. It also increases the chance that actual issues and unplanned events will be observed first hand and can be managed immediately; this includes issues that are not apparent to the ''genba'' workforce.

'''Hari-Bhari''' (Fertility) is 2000 [[Hindi]] film by [[Shyam Benegal]], starring [[Shabana Azmi]], [[Rajit Kapur]], [[Rajeshwari Sachdev]], [[Surekha Sikri]] and  [[Nandita Das]] in lead roles.

The film revolves around the story of five women, belonging to different generations, each looking emancipation and the right to run their lives their own way. The film's main theme is the issue of women's '[[Reproductive rights|fertility rights]]' empowerment.

The film won the 2000 [[National Film Award for Best Film on Family Welfare]].

==Plot==

The movie tells the story of a middle aged Muslim woman Gazala (Shabana Azmi), who is ill-treated by her husband and sent back to her parent's home, just because she is unable to give birth to a son.  Gazala does have a daughter Salma (Rajeshwari Sachdev). The plot revolves around Gazala's stay at her mother's home and the problems faced by the women of the house, being her mother and sisters-in-law. The film is a beautiful description of the problems faced by women in the name of fertility, or in a different sense the urge to have a male child, especially in rural India.[[Shyam Benegal]] provides a masterpiece, reflecting on the sorrowful plight of rural Indian women. The irony lies in the point where the movie begins with a scene which shows a bull being brought to impregnate a buffalo. Five different women, each with a different story depicting the harsh realities of a woman's life.

'''''Horne v. Flores''''', 557 U.S. 433 (2009), is a case in which the [[United States Supreme Court]] [[Remand (court procedure)#United States|remanded]] the case to determine whether [[Arizona|Arizona’s]] [[Education in the United States|general education]] funding budget supports [[Equal Educational Opportunities Act]] (EEOA)-compliant [[English as a foreign or second language|English Language Learner (ELL)]] programming.

==Background==
The case was brought in 1992 by English Language Learner (ELL) students against the [[Arizona#Education|state board of education and state superintendent]] on the grounds that the [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] Unified School District had failed to teach the students [[English language|English]], which was vital to their success.  The case is styled after the plaintiff, Miriam Flores, one of the parents involved in the case, and the defendant, [[Tom Horne|Thomas Horne]], the Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction. 

In 2000, after almost eight years of pretrial proceedings and settling of various claims, the federal district court in Arizona held that the state was violating the Equal Educational Opportunity Act because the amount of funding it allocated for the special needs of ELL students was arbitrary and not related to the actual funding needed to cover the costs of ELL instruction in the plaintiffs' school district.

==Opinion of the Court==
On June 25, 2009, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] overturned the decision of the state court, deciding in favor of Horne, and allowing the state to determine its own requirements with regards to ELL instruction. [[Justice Alito]] wrote the opinion for the 5-4 majority.  The opinion held that in evaluating the actions of the state attention should focus on student outcomes rather than on spending and inputs to schools.&lt;ref&gt;To support this, the majority opinion relied on the arguments in [[Eric Hanushek|Eric A. Hanushek]] and Alfred A. Lindseth (2009), ''Schoolhouses, courthouses, and statehouses:  Solving the funding-achievement puzzle in America's public schools'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dissent==
[[Justice Breyer]], joined by [[Justice Stevens]], [[Justice Souter]], and [[Justice Ginsburg]]. Justice Breyer argued that the lower courts did fairly consider every change in circumstances that the parties called to their attention, and that the majority opinion risks denying schoolchildren the English language instruction necessary to overcome language barriers that impede equal participation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-289.ZD.html&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''inexact differential equation''' is a [[differential equation]] of the form

: &lt;math&gt;M(x,y) \, dx+N(x,y) \, dy=0, \text{ where } \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} \ne \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}. &lt;/math&gt;

The solution to such equations came with the invention of the [[integrating factor]] by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1739.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eoht.info/page/History+of+differential+equations|title=History of differential equations – Hmolpedia|website=www.eoht.info|access-date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Solution method ==
In order to solve the equation, we need to transform it into an [[exact differential|exact differential equation]]. In order to do that, we need to find an [[integrating factor]] &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to multiply the equation by. We'll start with the equation itself.&lt;math&gt;M\,dx+N\,dy=0&lt;/math&gt;, so we get &lt;math&gt;\mu M\,dx+\mu N\,dy=0&lt;/math&gt;. We will require &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; to satisfy &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mu M}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial\mu N}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;. We get &lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial\mu}{\partial y}M+\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\mu=\frac{\partial\mu}{\partial x}N+\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}\mu&lt;/math&gt;. After simplifying we get &lt;math&gt;M\mu_y-N\mu_x+(M_y-N_x)\mu=0&lt;/math&gt;. Since this is a [[partial differential equation]], it is mostly extremely hard to solve, however in most cases we will get either &lt;math&gt;\mu (x,y) =\mu (x)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mu (x,y) =\mu (y)&lt;/math&gt;, in which case we only need to find &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; with a [[first-order linear differential equation]] or a [[separable differential equation]], and as such either &lt;math&gt;\mu(y)=e^{-\int{\frac{M_y-N_x}{M} \, dy}}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mu(x)=e^{\int{\frac{M_y-N_x} N \, dx}}&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15582">In [[feminist theory]], the principle of '''male-as-norm''' holds that "language referring to females, such as the suffix -ess (as in actress), the use of man to mean "human", and other such devices, strengthens the perceptions that the male category is the norm and that the corresponding female category is a derivation and thus less important. Sexist terms such as chairman, anchorman, etc., are cited as examples of how the English language mirrors social [[gender bias]]es.&lt;ref name=Danesi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danesi|first1=Marcel|title=Dictionary of Media and Communications|date=2009|publisher=M. E. Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|isbn=9788182744066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was first clearly expressed by 19th-century thinkers who began deconstructing the English language to expose the products and footings of patriarchy. The principle of male-as-norm and the relation between gendered grammar and the way in which its respective speakers conceptualize their world has received attention in varying fields from [[philosophy]] to [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], and has fueled debates over [[linguistic determinism]] and gender inequality. 
The underlying message of this principle is that women speak a less legitimate language that both sustains and is defined by the subordination of the female gender as secondary to the accepted male-biased normative language. By regarding women's language as deficient in relation to that of men it has been assumed that something is wrong with women's language. Subsequently research in the social sciences, particularly in discourse analysis, has maintained and qualified systemic male bias.&lt;ref name=MacDougall&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDougall|first1=D.|title=Gendered discourse and ASL-to-english interpreting: A poststructuralist approach to gendered discourse and the ASL-to-english interpretive process |journal=Journal of Interpretation |date=2012 |volume=19 |issue=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.unf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?&amp;article=1026&amp;context=joi |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In practice, grammatical gender exhibits a systematic structural bias that has made masculine forms the default for generic, non-gender-specific contexts. According to the male-as-norm principle the male linguistic bias works to exclude and ignore women, diminish the female experience, and rule that all that is not male is deviant and unfit to represent many social categories.&lt;ref name=Motschenbacker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Motschenbacker|first1=H|title=Language, gender and sexual identity : Poststructuralist perspectives|date=2010|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amersterdam, NLD|isbn=9789027218681|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==

=== Shift from sexual hierarchy to sexual binary (1800s) ===
In the eighteenth-century there was a radical reinterpretation of the female body in relation to the male. Prior to this change in thinking, men and women were qualified by their degree of metaphysical perfection whereas by the late eighteenth century there was a new model established on ideas of radical dimorphism and [[Sexual dimorphism|biological divergence]]. Biologists used developments in the study of anatomy and physiology to change the understanding of sexual difference into that of kind rather than degree. This metaphysical shift in the understanding of sex and gender, as well as the interplay of these redefined social categories, solidified many of the existing beliefs in the inherent disparities of men and women. This allowed scientists, policy makers, and others of cultural influence to promulgate a belief in the gender binary under a veil of positivism and scientific enlightenment.&lt;br /&gt;  
Since the eighteenth century, the dominant view of [[Sex differences in humans|sexual difference]] has been that of two stable, incommensurable, and opposite sexes on which the political, economic, and cultural lives of men and women are based and social order is sustained. Contrary to modern day, "the dominant discourse construed the male and female bodies as hierarchically, vertically, ordered versions of one sex" rather than as "horizontally ordered opposites, as incommensurable."&lt;ref name=Laqueur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laqueur|first1=Thomas|title=Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud|date=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780674543553}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it wasn't until the second half of the eighteenth century that the idea of two distinct sexes was established and, through the politics of the day, generated new ways of understanding people and social reality.
The recognition and discussion of this transition by protofeminists around the 19th century established the foundation upon which = feminists would later scrutinize gendered language, challenge the gender binary and its inherent prejudices, and develop the male as norm principle.

=== Mid-20th century ===

==== Simone De Beauvoir ====
In 1949, French existentialist [[Simone De Beauvoir]] described in her book ''[[The Second Sex]]'' two concepts that would later be developed in the fields of linguistics and psychology and become the basis for the male-as-norm principle in second-wave feminism.&lt;ref name=Bem&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bem|first1=S.|title=The lenses of gender: Transforming the debate on sexual inequality|date=1993|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300061635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beauvoir writes that man is regarded as "both the positive and the neutral," foreshadowing the study of [[markedness]], or the linguistic distinction between the "marked" and "unmarked" terms of an opposition. Specifically, "the notion that the typical contrast between opposites… is not symmetric." Rather, the contrast between oppositions is often asymmetric meaning "the positive, or unmarked, term can be neutralized in meaning to denote the scale as a whole rather than just the positive end; but the negative, or marked, term can denote just the negative end".&lt;ref name=Bem /&gt; Unaffixed masculine or singular forms are taken to be unmarked in contrast to affixed feminine or plural forms.

Beauvoir goes on to write that "there is an absolute human type, the masculine... Thus humanity is male,"&lt;ref name=Beauvoir&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beauvoir|first1=Simone de|title=The second sex|date=1953|publisher=Knopf|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the neutralizing of man to include woman is no longer her subject, rather the masculinizing of the whole human species to exclude woman–or at least to otherize her.&lt;ref name=Bem /&gt; Thus, introducing her second concept and foreshadowing the psychological concept of [[Prototype theory|prototypicality]] and the development of the prototype theory in the 1970s. "The prototype theory is a model of graded categorizations, where some members of a category are more central than others. A prototype helps to explain the meaning of a word by resembling to the clearest exemplar".&lt;ref name=Mustedanagic&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mustedanagic|first1=A.|title=Gender in english language and EFL textbooks (Independent thesis Basic Level (degree of Bachelor) |journal=Halmstad University Library |date=2010|doi= |url=http://hh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:346993 |accessdate=13 April 2015 |dead-url= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920113503/hh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:346993 |archive-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "All members of a category do not have equal status in the mind of the human perceiver; some members are instead perceived as more equal–or more prototypical–than other members… Like the prototypical member of any category, the male is taken to be the cognitive reference point, the standard, for the category of human being; and like the non-prototypical members of any category, the female is taken to be a variation on that prototype, a less representative example of the human species".&lt;ref name=Bem /&gt;

==== Luce Irigaray ====
Just as Simone de Beauvoir had done in recent decades, French feminist and literary scholar Luce Irigaray centered her ideas regarding the male as norm principle around the idea that women as a whole are otherized by systematic gender inequality, particularly through gendered language and how female experience and subjectivity are defined by variation from a male norm; through opposition in a phallocentric system where language is deliberately employed as a method of protecting the interests of the phallus and subliminally affirming his position as norm.
Irigaray affirms that the designation of woman as an inferior version of men, an aberrant variation from the male norm, is reflected throughout Western history and philosophy. Notably, Freud made similar sense of gender dynamics in his designation of women as 'little men'. In this tradition of inequality women are measured against a male standard, seen in comparison – as lack, complementary or the same. She asserts that any perception of difference between the two genders is an illusion. "Where women are not the same as men, they fail to exist altogether." 
&lt;ref name=Bacon&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Hannah|title=What's Right with the Trinity? : Conversations in Feminist Theology|date=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Group|location=Farnham, Surrey, GBR|isbn=9781409409298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dale Spender ====
[[Dale Spender]] is one of the most cited feminist scholars to work with the male-as-norm principle. She claims that "patriarchy is a frame of reference, a particular way of classifying and organizing the objects and events of the world" With language we classify and organize the world and through which we have the ability to manipulate reality. In this way, if our language is systematically flawed and/or rests on an understructure of invalid rules then we are misled and deceived at a fundamental perceptual level.
The rules by which we make meaning, ones intrinsically associated with language, had to be invented and defined. These linguistic rules establish our frame of reference, order, and the grounds from which we interpret and comprehend reality. Spender explains that  these rules become self-validating and self-perpetuating with the passing of time, regardless of the validity of the beliefs and/or interpretations on which they were founded.&lt;ref name=Spender&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spender|first1=Dale|title=Man Made Language|date=1998 |publisher=Pandora|location=London|isbn=0863584012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spender claims that  the semantic rule of male as norm may appear to be ineffectual in producing the purported significant social impact concluded by many feminists however this is in fact part of why the rule is so pervasive and superlatively harmful in the construction of our perceptions of gender. As long as this rule remains central to gendered languages users of these languages will continue to classify the world on the premise that males are the standard, normal being and that those who are not male will be considered deviant. Speakers will continue to divide humanity into two unfairly biased parts. "By arranging the objects and events of the world according to these rules we set up the rationale, and the vindication, for male supremacy."

==== Gerda Lerner ====
Over the course of feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]]'s career, Lerner focuses her studies on patriarchal power and the history of the subordination of women. By examining gender stratification in various societies throughout human history in accordance with language, Lerner provides an in-depth look into the historical and modern significance of the male as norm principle. She was one of the founders of the field of women's history and played a key role in the development of women's history curricula. In Lerner's book ''The Creation of Patriarchy'' (1986), she addresses how men have in history appropriated the major symbols of female power, constructed religions around "the counterfactual metaphor of male procreativity," and have "redefined female existence in a narrow and sexually dependent way." She explains that the metaphors for gender, created and promoted by men, have "expressed the male as norm and the female as deviant; the male as whole and powerful, the female as unfinished, mutilated, and lacking in autonomy." According to Lerner, men have constructed, explained, and defined the world in their own terms and have placed themselves at the center of discourse.  &lt;br /&gt; 
Lerner goes on to explain how men, by establishing male-centered language and discourse as the norm, have in turn demanded an androcentric perspective and necessitated the conceptualization of women as less than men and have distorted the definition of woman to the degree that their experiences, autonomy, and viewpoints have been lost to modern consideration. In turn, men have come to believe that their experiences, viewpoint, and ideas represent all of human experience and thought. She concludes that as long as men are unable to recognize the female perspective and as long as they believe they have the only legitimatize human experience they will be unable to accurately define and understand reality.&lt;ref name=Lerner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerner|first1=Gerda|title=The creation of partiarchy|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0195039963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern perspectives ==

=== Sue Wilkinson ===
In 1997 [[Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson|Sue Wilkinson]], a professor of Feminist and Health Studies from Loughborough University, wrote that there are distinct theoretical traditions in feminism that assert women's inferiority, two of which are rooted in the idea of male-as-norm. First, psychology has mismeasured women throughout its history by taking a male-as-norm perspective which categorizes females as deviant; or, in other words of Simone De Beauvoir, the science of psychology has systematically "otherized" women. Another way which Wilkinson sees women's inferiority asserted is through psychologists seeking a different perspective, the female perspective, by listening to women's voices and drawing on, and feeding back into, preconceived ideas regarding female moral and cognitive processes as they differ from those of males. Wilkinson writes that we should reconstruct the question of sex differences and that we need to dismantle maleness and femaleness as fundamental categories.&lt;ref name=Hepburn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hepburn|first1=Alexa|title=An introduction to critical social psychology|date=2003|publisher=SAGE|location=London; Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=9781446218884|url=http://site.ebrary.com/id/10080978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jeannine Hill Fletcher ===
In her book ''Motherhood as Metaphor: Engendering Interreligious Dialogue'', professor of theology Jeannine Hill Fletcher of Fordham University notes that scripture and Christians theological writings have presented theological anthropology from a male-as-norm perspective due to a history of predominantly male theologians and philosophers. She notes that this has had disastrous effects on the lives of women and the valuation of the female perspective and consequently the history of Christian theology has missed opportunities for opening new understandings of what it means to be human.&lt;ref name=Fletcher&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fletcher|first1=Jeannine H.|title=Motherhood as Metaphor: Engendering Interreligious Dialogue|date=2013|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780823251186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maslow's hierarchy of needs''' is a theory in [[psychology]] proposed by [[Abraham Maslow]] in his 1943 paper "A Theory of Human Motivation" in ''[[Psychological Review]]''.&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;{{cite journal|first=A.H.|last=Maslow|authorlink=Abraham Maslow|year=1943|title=A theory of human motivation |journal=Psychological Review|volume=50|issue=4|pages=370–96 |via=psychclassics.yorku.ca| url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Maslow/motivation.htm|doi=10.1037/h0054346}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maslow subsequently extended the idea to include his observations of humans' innate curiosity. His theories parallel many other theories of human [[developmental psychology]], some of which focus on describing the stages of growth in humans. He then decided to create a classification system which reflected the universal needs of society as its base and then proceeding to more acquired emotions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Motivation: Biological, Psychological, and Environmental|last=Deckers|first=Lambert|publisher=Routledge Press|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maslow's hierarchy of needs is used to study how humans partake in behavioral motivation intrinsically. Maslow used the terms "physiological," "safety," "belonging&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;love," "esteem," and "self-actualization" to describe the pattern through which human motivations generally move. This means that in order for motivation to occur at the next level, each level must be satisfied within the individual themselves. Furthermore, this theory is a key foundation in understanding how drive and motivation are correlated when discussing human behavior. Each of these individual levels contains a certain amount of internal sensation that must be met in order for an individual to complete their hierarchy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;The goal of Maslow's Theory is to attain the fifth level or stage: self-actualization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/857664345|title=Theoretical basis for nursing|last=M.,|first=Wills, Evelyn|isbn=9781451190311|oclc=857664345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maslow's theory was fully expressed in his 1954 book ''[[Motivation and Personality]].''&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"&gt;{{cite book|title=Motivation and personality|last=Maslow|first=A|publisher=Harper|year=1954|isbn=0-06-041987-3|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hierarchy remains a very popular framework in [[sociology]] research, management training&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kremer|first=William Kremer|title=Abraham Maslow and the pyramid that beguiled business|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23902918|accessdate=1 September 2013|newspaper=BBC news magazine|date=31 August 2013|author2=Hammond, Claudia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] psychology instruction. Maslow's classification hierarchy has been revised over time. The original hierarchy states that a lower level must be completely satisfied and fulfilled before moving onto a higher pursuit. However, today scholars prefer to think of these levels as continuously overlapping each other.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This means that the lower levels may take precedent back over the other levels at any point in time.

== Hierarchy ==
[[File:Dynamic hierarchy of needs - Maslow.svg|thumb|Alternative illustration as a dynamic hierarchy of needs with overlaps of different needs at the same time]]
Maslow's hierarchy of [[need]]s is often portrayed in the shape of a pyramid with the largest, most fundamental needs at the bottom and the need for [[self-actualization]] and transcendence at the top. In other words, The crux of the theory is that individuals’ most basic needs must be met before they become motivated to achieve higher level needs.&lt;ref name=honolulu/&gt;&lt;ref name=steere&gt;{{cite book |title= Becoming an effective classroom manager: A resource for teachers. |author= Steere, B. F. |publisher= SUNY Press |location=Albany, NY|year= 1988 |isbn= 0-88706-620-8 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=S2cwd56VvOMC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=Maslow's+hierarchy+of+needs&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Maslow's%20hierarchy%20of%20needs }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most fundamental and basic four layers of the pyramid contain what Maslow called "deficiency needs" or "d-needs": esteem, friendship and love, security, and physical needs. If these "deficiency needs" are not met – with the exception of the most fundamental (physiological) need – there may not be a physical indication, but the individual will feel anxious and tense. Maslow's theory suggests that the most basic level of needs must be met before the individual will strongly desire (or focus motivation upon) the secondary or higher level needs. Maslow also coined the term "[[metamotivation]]" to describe the motivation of people who go beyond the scope of the basic needs and strive for constant betterment.&lt;ref&gt;Goble, F. (1970). ''The third force: The psychology of Abraham Maslow.'' Richmond, CA: Maurice Bassett Publishing. pp. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The human brain is a complex system and has parallel processes running at the same time, thus many different motivations from various levels of Maslow's hierarchy can occur at the same time. Maslow spoke clearly about these levels and their satisfaction in terms such as "relative", "general", and "primarily". Instead of stating that the individual focuses on a certain need at any given time, Maslow stated that a certain need "dominates" the human organism.&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt; Thus Maslow acknowledged the likelihood that the different levels of motivation could occur at any time in the human mind, but he focused on identifying the basic types of motivation and the order in which they would tend to be met.

=== Physiological needs ===
Physiological need is a concept that was derived to explain and cultivate the foundation for motivation. This concept is the basic foundation of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This term was coined to represent a similar premise as drive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Physiological needs are considered the main physical requirements for human survival. This means that Physiological needs are universal human needs. Physiological needs are considered the first step in internal motivation according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This theory states that humans are compelled to fulfill these physiological needs first in order to pursue intrinsic satisfaction on a higher level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If these needs are not achieved, it leads to an increase in displeasure within an individual. In return, when individuals feel this increase in displeasure, the motivation to decrease these discrepancies increases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Physiological needs can be defined as both traits and a state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Physiological needs as traits allude to long-term, unchanging demands that are required of basic human life. Physiological needs as a state allude to the unpleasant decrease in pleasure and the increase for an incentive to fulfill a necessity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to pursue intrinsic motivation higher up Maslow's hierarchy, Physiological needs must be met first. This means that if a human is struggling to meet their physiological needs, then they are unlikely to intrinsically pursue safety, belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization. Physiological needs include:

* Food
* Water
* Sleep
* Shelter
* Sex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs |url=https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html |website=simply psychology |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Five Levels of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs |url=https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-maslows-hierarchy-of-needs-4136760 |website=verywell mind |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety needs ===

Once a person's physiological needs are relatively satisfied, their safety needs take precedence and dominate behavior. In the absence of physical safety – due to war, natural disaster, [[family violence]], [[childhood abuse]], etc. – people may (re-)experience [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] or [[transgenerational trauma]]. In the absence of economic safety – due to an economic crisis and lack of work opportunities – these safety needs manifest themselves in ways such as a preference for [[job security]], grievance procedures for protecting the individual from unilateral authority, savings accounts, insurance policies, disability accommodations, etc. This level is more likely to predominate in children as they generally have a greater need to feel safe. Safety and security needs are about keeping us safe from harm. These include shelter, job security, health, and safe environments. If a person does not feel safe in an environment, they will seek to find safety before they attempt to meet any higher level of survival, but the need for safety is not as important as basic physiological needs.

Safety and Security needs include:

* [[Personal security]]
* [[Emotional security]]
* [[Economic security|Financial security]]
* [[Health]] and [[well-being]]
* Safety needs against accidents/illness and their adverse impacts

=== Social belonging ===

After physiological and safety needs are fulfilled, the third level of human needs are seen to be interpersonal and involves feelings of [[belongingness]]. This need is especially strong in childhood and it can override the need for safety as witnessed in children who cling to abusive parents. Deficiencies within this level of Maslow's hierarchy – due to [[hospitalism]], [[neglect]], [[shunning]], [[ostracism]], etc. – can adversely affect the individual's ability to form and maintain emotionally significant relationships in general.

Social Belonging needs include:

* [[Friendships]]
* [[Intimacy]]
* [[Family]]

According to Maslow, humans need to feel a sense of belonging and acceptance among social groups, regardless whether [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft|these groups are large or small]]. For example, some large social groups may include clubs, co-workers, religious groups, professional organizations, sports teams, gangs, and online communities. Some examples of small social connections include family members, intimate partners, mentors, colleagues, and confidants. Humans need to love and be loved – both sexually and non-sexually – by others.&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt; Many people become susceptible to [[loneliness]], [[social anxiety]], and [[clinical depression]] in the absence of this love or belonging element. This need for belonging may overcome the physiological and security needs, depending on the strength of the peer pressure.

=== Esteem ===

Esteem needs are ego needs or status needs. People develop a concern with getting recognition, status, importance, and respect from others. Most humans have a need to feel respected; this includes the need to have [[self-esteem]] and self-respect. Esteem presents the typical human desire to be accepted and valued by others. People often engage in a profession or hobby to gain recognition. These activities give the person a sense of contribution or value. Low self-esteem or an [[inferiority complex]] may result from imbalances during this level in the hierarchy. People with low self-esteem often need respect from others; they may feel the need to seek fame or glory. However, fame or glory will not help the person to build their self-esteem until they accept who they are internally. Psychological imbalances such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] can distract the person from obtaining a higher level of self-esteem.

Most people have a need for stable self-respect and self-esteem. Maslow noted two versions of esteem needs: a "lower" version and a "higher" version. The "lower" version of esteem is the need for respect from others. This may include a need for status, recognition, fame, prestige, and attention. The "higher" version manifests itself as the need for self-respect. For example, the person may have a need for strength, competence&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;, mastery, [[self-confidence]], independence, and freedom. This "higher" version takes guidelines, the "hierarchies are interrelated rather than sharply separated".&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt; This means that esteem and the subsequent levels are not strictly separated; instead, the levels are closely related.

=== Self-actualization ===
{{Main|Self-actualization}}

"What a man can be, he must be."&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt;{{rp|91}} This quotation forms the basis of the perceived need for self-actualization. This level of need refers to what a person's full potential is and the realization of that potential. Maslow describes this level as the desire to accomplish everything that one can, to become the most that one can be.&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt;{{rp|92}} Individuals may perceive or focus on this need very specifically. For example, one individual may have a strong desire to become an ideal parent. In another, the desire may be expressed athletically. For others, it may be expressed in paintings, pictures, or inventions.&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt;{{rp|93}} As previously mentioned, Maslow believed that to understand this level of need, the person must not only achieve the previous needs but master them. Self-actualization can often be described as a value-based system when discussing its role in motivation. Since all levels of Maslow's hierarchy must have been met in order to acquire this level, seeking to fulfill this form of satisfaction can be defined as an explicit motive. An explicit motive can be defined as a reward-based system that is used to intrinsically pursue certain values or goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Individuals who are motivated to pursue this level are seeking and understanding how their sense of self-partakes within their human behavior. Self-actualization can include:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

*Mate Acquisition
*Parenting 
*Utilizing Abilities 
*Utilizing Talents 
*Pursuing a goal 
*Seeking Happiness

=== Transcendence ===
{{Main|Transcendence}}
In his later years, Abraham Maslow explored a further dimension of motivation, while criticizing his original vision of self-actualization.&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, Abraham H. (1996). Critique of self-actualization theory. In: E. Hoffman (Ed.), ''Future visions: The unpublished papers of Abraham Maslow.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, pp. 26–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, Abraham H. (1969). The farther reaches of human nature. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'' 1:1, pp. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maslow, Abraham H. (1971). ''The farther reaches of human nature.'' New York: The Viking Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koltko-Rivera, Mark E. (2006). Rediscovering the later version of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs: Self-transcendence and opportunities for theory, research, and unification, ''Review of General Psychology'' 10:4, pp. 302-317. [http://academic.udayton.edu/jackbauer/Readings%20595/Koltko-Rivera%2006%20trans%20self-act%20copy.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; By this later theory, one finds the fullest realization in giving oneself to something beyond oneself — for example, in altruism or spirituality. He equated this with the desire to reach the infinite.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia-Romeu, Albert. (2010). Self-transcendence as a measurable transpersonal construct. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psychology'', 421, p. 26-47 [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Albert_Garcia-Romeu/publication/271706485_Self-transcendence_as_a_measurable_transpersonal_construct/links/5501b17d0cf2d60c0e5fdfeb.pdf (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Transcendence refers to the very highest and most inclusive or holistic levels of human consciousness, behaving and relating, as ends rather than means, to oneself, to significant others, to human beings in general, to other species, to nature, and to the [[cosmos]]" (''Farther Reaches of Human Nature'', New York 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;269).

== Research ==

Recent research appears to validate the existence of universal human needs, although the hierarchy proposed by Maslow is called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Villarica|first= H.|date=August 17, 2011|title= Maslow 2.0: A new and improved recipe for happiness|website=theatlantic.com|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/life/archive/2011/08/maslow-20-a-new-and-improved-recipe-for-happiness/243486/#.TkvKIRv8USE.facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tay | first1 = L. | last2 = Diener | first2 = E. | year = 2011 | title = Needs and subjective well-being around the world | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 101 | issue = 2| pages = 354–365 | doi = 10.1037/a0023779 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[World War II]], the unmet needs of homeless and orphaned children presented difficulties that were often addressed with the help of [[attachment theory]], which was initially based on Maslow and others'  developmental psychology work by [[John Bowlby]].&lt;ref name="Bretherton"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bretherton, I. |title=The Origins of Attachment Theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth |year=1992 |journal=Developmental Psychology |pages=759–775 |volume=28 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally dealing primarily with [[maternal deprivation]] and concordant losses of essential and primal needs, attachment theory has since been extended to provide explanations of nearly all the human needs in Maslow's hierarchy, from sustenance and mating to group membership and justice.&lt;ref name="Bugental"&gt;{{cite journal|author= Bugental DB|year= 2000|title= Acquisition of the Algorithms of Social Life: A Domain-Based Approach|journal= Psychological Bulletin|volume= 126|pages= 178–219|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.126.2.187|pmid=10748640|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Unlike most scientific theories, Maslow's hierarchy of needs has widespread influence outside academia. As Uriel Abulof argues, "The continued resonance of Maslow's theory in popular imagination, however unscientific it may seem, is possibly the single most telling evidence of its significance: it explains human nature as something that most humans immediately recognize in themselves and others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Introduction: Why We Need Maslow in the Twenty-First Century|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0198-6|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=508|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0198-6|issn=0147-2011|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, academically, Maslow's theory is heavily contested.

=== Methodology ===
Maslow studied what he called the master race of people such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Jane Addams]], [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], and [[Frederick Douglass]] rather than [[mentally ill]] or [[neurosis|neurotic]] people, writing that "the study of crippled, stunted, immature, and unhealthy specimens can yield only a cripple psychology and a cripple philosophy."&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954" /&gt;{{rp|236}}
Maslow studied the healthiest 1% of the college student population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mittelman|first1=W.|year=1991|title=Maslow's study of self-actualization: A reinterpretation|url=|journal=Journal of Humanistic Psychology|volume=31|issue=1|pages=114–135|doi=10.1177/0022167891311010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ranking ===
==== Global ranking ====
In their extensive review of research based on Maslow's theory, Wahba and Bridwell found little evidence for the ranking of needs that Maslow described or for the existence of a definite hierarchy at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wahba | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Bridwell | first2 = L. G. | year = 1976 | title = Maslow reconsidered: A review of research on the need hierarchy theory | url = | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Performance | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 212–240 | doi = 10.1016/0030-5073(76)90038-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The order in which the hierarchy is arranged has been criticized as being ethnocentric by [[Geert Hofstede]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofstede | first1 = G. | year = 1984 | title = The cultural relativity of the quality of life concept | url = http://myweb.usf.edu/~jdorio/Articles/The%20cultural%20relativity%20of%20the%20quality%20of%20life%20concept.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 389–398 | doi = 10.5465/amr.1984.4279653 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141112000247/http://myweb.usf.edu/~jdorio/Articles/The%20cultural%20relativity%20of%20the%20quality%20of%20life%20concept.pdf | archivedate = 2014-11-12 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maslow's hierarchy of needs fails to illustrate and expand upon the difference between the social and intellectual needs of those raised in [[Individualism|individualistic]] societies and those raised in [[Collectivism|collectivist]] societies. The needs and drives of those in individualistic societies tend to be more self-centered than those in collectivist societies, focusing on improvement of the self, with self-actualization being the apex of self-improvement. In collectivist societies, the needs of acceptance and community will outweigh the needs for freedom and individuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cianci | first1 = R. | last2 = Gambrel | first2 = P. A. | year = 2003 | title = Maslow's hierarchy of needs: Does it apply in a collectivist culture | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Management and Entrepreneurship | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 143–161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ranking of sex ====
The position and value of sex on the pyramid has also been a source of criticism regarding Maslow's hierarchy. Maslow's hierarchy places sex in the physiological needs category along with food and breathing; it lists sex solely from an individualistic perspective. For example, sex is placed with other physiological needs which must be satisfied before a person considers "higher" levels of motivation. Some critics feel this placement of sex neglects the emotional, familial, and evolutionary implications of sex within the community, although others point out that this is true of all of the basic needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kenrick|first= D. |date=May 19, 2010|title= Rebuilding Maslow's pyramid on an evolutionary foundation. |website= psychologytoday.com/|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201005/rebuilding-maslow-s-pyramid-evolutionary-foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kenrick | first1 = D.

==== Changes to the hierarchy by circumstance ====

The higher-order (self-esteem and self-actualization) and lower-order (physiological, safety, and love) needs classification of Maslow's hierarchy of needs is not universal and may vary across cultures due to individual differences and availability of resources in the region or geopolitical entity/country.

In one study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = T. L. | last2 = West | first2 = W. B. | year = 1997 | title = The importance of human needs during peacetime, retrospective peacetime, and the Persian Gulf War | url = | journal = International Journal of Stress Management | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 47–62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of a thirteen item scale showed there were two particularly important levels of needs in the US during the peacetime of 1993 to 1994: survival (physiological and safety) and psychological (love, self-esteem, and self-actualization). In 1991, a retrospective peacetime measure was established and collected during the Persian Gulf War and US citizens were asked to recall the importance of needs from the previous year. Once again, only two levels of needs were identified; therefore, people have the ability and competence to recall and estimate the importance of needs. For citizens in the Middle East (Egypt and Saudi Arabia), three levels of needs regarding importance and satisfaction surfaced during the 1990 retrospective peacetime. These three levels were completely different from those of the US citizens.

Changes regarding the importance and satisfaction of needs from the retrospective peacetime to the wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US vs. the Middle East). For the US citizens, there was only one level of needs since all needs were considered equally important. With regards to satisfaction of needs during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological needs, safety needs, and psychological needs (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological needs and safety needs were separated into two independent needs while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the Middle East, the satisfaction of needs changed from three levels to two during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Ibrahim | first2 = A. H. | year = 1998 | title = Importance of human needs during retrospective peacetime and the Persian Gulf War: Mid-eastern employees | url = | journal = International Journal of Stress Management | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 25–37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tang | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Ibrahim | first2 = A. H. | last3 = West | first3 = W. B. | year = 2002 | title = Effects of war-related stress on the satisfaction of human needs: The United States and the Middle East | url = | journal = International Journal of Management Theory and Practices | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 35–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1981 study looked at how Maslow's hierarchy might vary across age groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goebel | first1 = B. L. | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. R. | year = 1981 | title = Age differences in motivation related to Maslow's need hierarchy | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 809–815 | doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.17.6.809 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey asked participants of varying ages to rate a set number of statements from most important to least important. The researchers found that children had higher physical need scores than the other groups, the love need emerged from childhood to young adulthood, the esteem need was highest among the adolescent group, young adults had the highest self-actualization level, and old age had the highest level of security, it was needed across all levels comparably. The authors argued that this suggested Maslow's hierarchy may be limited as a theory for developmental sequence since the sequence of the love need and the self-esteem need should be reversed according to age.

=== Definition of terms ===
==== Self-actualization ====
The term "self-actualization" may not universally convey Maslow's observations; this motivation refers to focusing on becoming the best person that one can possibly strive for in the service of both the self and others.&lt;ref name="Maslow, A. 1954"/&gt;{{Primary inline|date=April 2018}} Maslow's term of self-actualization might not properly portray the full extent of this level; quite often, when a person is at the level of self-actualization, much of what they accomplish in general may benefit others, or "the greater good".{{Original research inline|date=April 2018}}

=== Human or non-human needs ===
Abulof argues that  while Maslow stresses that "motivation theory must be anthropocentric rather than animalcentric," his theory erects a largely animalistic pyramid, crowned with a human edge: "Man's higher nature rests upon man's lower nature, needing it as a foundation and collapsing without this foundation… Our godlike qualities rest upon and need our animal qualities." Abulof notes that "all animals seek survival and safety, and many animals, especially mammals, also invest efforts to belong and gain esteem... The first four of Maslow's classical five rungs feature nothing exceptionally human."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=530|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when it comes to "self-actualization," Abulof argues, it is unclear how distinctively human is the actualizing "self." After all, the latter, according to Maslow, constitutes "an inner, more biological, more instinctoid core of human nature," thus "the search for one's own intrinsic, authentic values" checks the human freedom of choice: "A musician must make music," so freedom is limited to merely the choice of instrument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=532|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6350">[[File:Mexican Standoff.jpg|thumb|Three men pointing guns at one another in an apparent Mexican standoff]]

A '''Mexican standoff''' is a confrontation amongst three or more parties in which no strategy exists that allows any party to achieve victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Dealing with Dilemmas: Where Business Analytics Fall Short | author=Buytendijk, Frank | publisher=Wiley | year=2010 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_GFs9zomoSQC | isbn=978-0-470-76848-8 | page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Concise Dictionary of English Combined (idioms, Phrases, Proverbs, Similes) | author=V&amp;S Editorial Board | publisher=V&amp;S Publishers | year=2015 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W6E3DwAAQBAJ | page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, all participants need to maintain the strategic tension, which remains unresolved until some outside event makes it possible to resolve it.

The term ''Mexican standoff'' was originally used in the context of using firearms and today still commonly implies a situation in which the parties face some form of threat from the other parties. The Mexican standoff is a recurring [[trope (cinema)|trope in cinema]], in which several armed characters hold each other at gunpoint.

== Etymology ==
The expression came into use during the last decade of the 19th century; the ''[[Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary]]'' makes an unattributed claim that the term is of [[Australia|Australian]] origin.  Other sources{{which|date=June 2015}} claim the reference is to the [[Mexican–American War]] or post-war Mexican bandits in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="worddet" /&gt;

The earliest print cite to the phrase was 19 March 1876 in a short story about Mexico, an American being held up by a Mexican bandit, and the outcome:&lt;ref&gt;"Mexican, n. and adj.". OED Online. March 2018. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"Go-!" said he sternly then. "We will call it a stand-off, a Mexican stand-off, you lose your money, but you save your life!" | F. Harvey Smith | ''Sunday Mercury'', New York, 1876}}

== Popular use ==
In popular use, the term ''Mexican standoff'' is sometimes used in reference to confrontations in which neither opponent appears to have a measurable advantage. Historically, commentators have used the term to reference the [[Soviet Union]]&amp;nbsp;– [[United States]] nuclear confrontation during the [[Cold War]], specifically the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] of 1962. The key element that makes such situations ''Mexican standoffs'' is the equality of power exercised among the involved parties.&lt;ref name="worddet"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.word-detective.com/2011/03/mexican-standoff/|title=Mexican standoff|work=The Word Detective|accessdate=2013-03-21}}{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability of any particular party to advance its position safely is a condition common among all standoffs; in a "Mexican standoff," however, there is an additional disadvantage: no party has a safe way to ''withdraw'' from its position, thus making the standoff effectively permanent.

In financial circles, the Mexican standoff is typically used to denote a situation where one side wants something, a concession of some sort, and is offering nothing of value. When the other side sees no value in agreeing to any changes, they refuse to negotiate. Although both sides may benefit from the change, neither side can agree to adequate compensation for agreeing to the change, and nothing is accomplished.

A Mexican standoff where each party is pointing a gun at another is now considered a movie [[cliché]], stemming from its frequent use as a [[plot device]] in cinema. A famous example of the trope is in [[Sergio Leone]]'s 1966 Western ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', where the titular characters played by [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Lee Van Cleef]] and [[Eli Wallach]] face each other at gunpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SRNB0B5c0DAC&amp;pg=PT96 | title=Professional Storyboarding: Rules of Thumb | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | author=Jew, Anson | year=2013 | pages=83 | isbn=1-136-12677-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lbckmstrbbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160210-the-lasting-legacy-of-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly Buckmaster, Luke.

Director [[John Woo]], considered a major influence on the [[action genre]], is known for his highly chaotic action sequences, Mexican standoffs, and frequent use of [[slow motion]].&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pierce|first1=Nev|title=Calling The Shots: John Woo|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/callingtheshots/john_woo.shtml|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] (who has cited Woo as an influence) has featured Mexican standoff scenes in his films like ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' (restaurant sequence); ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (the tavern scene features multiple Mexican standoffs including meta-discussion); and the climactic scene of ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'', which depicts a standoff among four characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YSkQAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45 | title=Pulp Fiction: The Complete Story of Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece | publisher=Voyageur Press | author=Bailey, Jason | year=2013 | pages=45 | isbn=978-0-7603-4479-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mexican standoff also features prominently in the mission ''The Wrap Up'' in ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', in which a meeting between protagonist Michael De Santa and the FIB quickly devolves into an all out four-way battle among the FIB, IAA and Merryweather agents.

''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' also features a notable Mexican standoff between 6 men, which coincidentally takes place in Mexico. One of the participants also makes a humorous nod to the trope, realizing the situation and claiming ''“There must be a name for this.”''

A '''mirror punishment''' is a penal form of [[poetic justice]] which reflects the nature or means of the crime in the means of (often physical) punishment as a form of [[retributive justice]]—the practice of "repaying" a wrongdoer "in kind".

It can be an application of the ''lex talionis'' (“[[an eye for an eye]]”), but is not always [[proportional justice]], as a similar method may be used to produce a worse or milder effect than the crime it "retaliates".

The simplest method of mirror punishment is to enact the same action upon the criminal as the criminal perpetrated upon the victim. For example, thieves have the same amount of money taken from them as they stole; one who strikes another is struck in the same way; one who willfully causes another person's death is killed; and so on.

Often, however, a more esoteric method of mirror punishment is used, which implies punishing the part of the criminal's body used to commit the crime. Extreme examples include the amputation of the hands of a [[thief]], as still permitted by [[Sharia]] law, or during the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]]; or disabling the foot or leg of a runaway slave. 
[[File:Station 1 Handabschlagen Bamberger Kreuzweg.jpg|thumb]]

Other examples include the punishment of [[adultery|adulterous]] women by the insertion of irritating substances into their vaginas (in the past hot pokers were sometimes used). A less extreme example is putting soap into a child's mouth for using inappropriate language (referred to in English as "washing someone's mouth out with soap"). 	

Another method to accomplish "poetic justice" is to mirror the physical method of the crime, e.g., executing a murderer with his own weapon, burning [[arson]]ists alive, or in a more far-fetched example, boiling a counterfeiter alive (because [[bullion]] is boiled to be minted{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}).

==Popular culture==
W. S. Gilbert's comic opera ''[[The Mikado]]'' contains a song satirizing mirror punishment. For example:

:The billiard-sharp whom anyone catches 
:His doom’s extremely hard—
:He’s made to dwell 
:In a dungeon cell 
:On a spot that’s always barred.
:And there he plays extravagant matches 
:In fitless finger-stalls, 
:On a cloth untrue 
:With a twisted cue
:And elliptical billiard balls.

The refrain line "to let the punishment fit the crime" has sometimes been quoted in the course of British political debates, though the concept predates Gilbert.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Green, Edward. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3634126.stm "Ballads,songs and speeches",] ''BBC News'', 20 September 2004, accessed 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://keithwiley.com/mindRamblings/deathPenalty.shtml Keith Wiley webpage], referring to the Code of [[Hammurabi]]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, episode 80 of the television series ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', entitled "Let the Punishment Fit the Crime", features bits of several songs from ''The Mikado''.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of Magnum, P.I. episodes|Wikipedia List of Magnum, P.I. episodes]] and [http://www.tv.com/magnum-p.i./let-the-punishment-fit-the-crime/episode/16074/summary.html TV.com Magnum, P.I. Episode Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase and the Mikado's song also are featured in the ''[[Dad's Army]]'' episode, "A Soldier's Farewell." In ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' (1961), the camp director quotes the phrase before sentencing the twins to the isolation cabin together.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9253">'''Model-dependent realism''' is a view of scientific inquiry that focuses on the role of [[scientific model]]s of phenomena.&lt;ref name=Koonin/&gt; It claims reality should be interpreted based upon these models, and where several models overlap in describing a particular subject, multiple, equally valid, realities exist. It claims that it is meaningless to talk about the "true reality" of a model as we can never be ''absolutely'' certain of anything. The only meaningful thing is the [[explanatory power|usefulness of the model]].&lt;ref name=Hawking/&gt; The term "model-dependent realism" was coined by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Leonard Mlodinow]] in their 2010 book, ''[[The Grand Design (book)|The Grand Design]]''.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;

==Overview==
Model-dependent realism asserts that all we can know about "reality" consists of networks of ''world pictures'' that explain ''observations'' by connecting them by ''rules'' to concepts defined in ''models''. Will an ultimate [[theory of everything]] be found? Hawking/Mlodinow suggest it is unclear:
{{quote|In the history of science we have discovered a sequence of better and better theories or models, from Plato to the classical theory of Newton to modern quantum theories. It is natural to ask: Will this sequence eventually reach an end point, an ultimate theory of the universe, that will include all forces and predict every observation we can make, or will we continue forever finding better theories, but never one that cannot be improved upon? We do not yet have a definitive answer to this question...&lt;ref name=Sequence/&gt;|Stephen Hawking &amp; Leonard Mlodinow| The Grand Design, p. 8}}

A ''world picture'' consists of the combination of a set of observations accompanied by a conceptual model and by rules connecting the model concepts to the observations. Different world pictures that describe particular data equally well all have equal claims to be valid. There is no requirement that a world picture be unique, or even that the data selected include all available observations. The universe of all observations at present is covered by a ''network'' of overlapping world pictures and, where overlap occurs; multiple, equally valid, world pictures exist. At present, science requires multiple models to encompass existing observations:
{{quote|Like the overlapping maps in a Mercator projection, where the ranges of different versions overlap, they predict the same phenomena. But just as there is no flat map that is a good representation of the earth's entire surface, there is no single theory that is a good representation of observations in all situations&lt;ref name=Mercator/&gt;|Stephen Hawking &amp; Leonard Mlodinow| The Grand Design, p. 9}} Where several models are found for the same phenomena, no single model is preferable to the others within that domain of overlap.

==Model selection==
{{see also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
While not rejecting the idea of "reality-as-it-is-in-itself", model-dependent realism suggests that we cannot know "reality-as-it-is-in-itself", but only an approximation of it provided by the intermediary of models. The view of models in model-dependent realism also is related to the [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] approach to modern science, that a concept or theory should be evaluated by how effectively it explains and predicts phenomena, as opposed to how accurately it describes objective reality (a matter possibly impossible to establish). A model is a good model if it:&lt;ref name=Desiderata/&gt;
#Is elegant
#Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements
#Agrees with and explains all existing observations
#Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out.
"If the modifications needed to accommodate new observations become too baroque, it signals the need for a new model." &lt;ref name=Baroque/&gt; Of course, an assessment like that is subjective, as are the other criteria.&lt;ref name=Simplicity/&gt; According to Hawking and Mlodinow, even very successful models in use today do not satisfy all these criteria, which are aspirational in nature.&lt;ref name=Failure/&gt;

{{wiktionary pipe|mores#Etymology 1|mores}}

==Terminology==
The English word [[morality]] comes from the same Latin root "mōrēs", as does the English noun ''moral''. However, mores do not, as is commonly supposed, necessarily carry connotations of morality. Rather, morality can be seen as a subset of mores, held to be of central importance in view of their content, and often formalized in some kind of [[moral code]].

The Greek terms equivalent to Latin ''mores'' are ''[[ethos]]'' (ἔθος, ἦθος, 'character') or ''[[Law|nomos]]'' (νόμος, 'law'). As with the relation of ''mores'' to ''morality'', ''ethos'' is the basis of the term ''[[ethics]]'', ''nomos'' give the suffix ''-onomy'', as in [[:wikt:astronomy|astronomy]].

==Anthropology==
The meaning of all these terms extend to all customs of proper behavior in a given society, both religious and profane, from more trivial [[convention (norm)|conventional]] aspects of [[custom (law)|custom]], [[etiquette]] or [[politeness]]—"folkways" enforced by gentle social pressure, but going beyond mere "folkways" or conventions in including [[moral code]]s and notions of [[justice]]—down to strict [[taboo]]s, behavior that is unthinkable within the society in question, very commonly including [[incest]] and [[murder]], but also the commitment of outrages specific to the individual society such as [[blasphemy]]. Such religious or sacral customs may vary.

While [[cultural universals]] are by definition part of the ''mores'' of every society (hence also called "empty universals"), the customary norms specific to a given society are a defining aspect of the [[cultural identity]] of an [[ethnicity]] or a [[nation]]. Coping with the differences between two sets of cultural conventions is a question of [[intercultural competence]].

Differences in the ''mores'' of various nations are at the root of [[ethnic stereotype]], or in the case of reflection upon one's own ''mores'', autostereotypes.

The Convention covers health care, social security, tax, school, and employment authorities, the police and

'''Psychonautics''' (from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ψυχή}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|psychē}}'' ["soul", "spirit" or "mind"] and {{lang|grc|ναύτης}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|naútēs}}'' ["sailor" or "navigator"] – "a sailor of the soul"&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blom |first=Jan Dirk |title=A Dictionary of Hallucinations |page=434 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbF44AEMGdcC&amp;pg=PA434 |accessdate=2010-03-05 | isbn=978-1-4419-1222-0 | year=2009 | publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;) refers both to a methodology for describing and explaining the subjective effects of [[altered states of consciousness]], especially an important subgroup called holotropic states, including those induced by [[meditation]] or [[psychoactive drug|mind-altering substances]], and to a research [[paradigm]] in which the researcher voluntarily immerses themselves into an altered mental state in order to explore the accompanying experiences.&lt;ref name="addiction research"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/16066350801983707 |year=2008 |last1=Newcombe |first1=Russell |title=Ketamine Case Study: The Phenomenology of a Ketamine Experience |pages=209–215 |journal=Addiction Research &amp; Theory |volume=16 |issue=3 |url=http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/16066350801983707 |accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been applied diversely, to cover all activities by which [[Altered state of consciousness|altered state]]s are induced and utilized for [[spirituality|spiritual]] purposes or the exploration of the [[human condition]], including [[shamanism]], [[lama]]s of the [[Tibet]]an [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition,&lt;ref name="flores"&gt;As noted by {{cite book |last=Flores |first=Ralph |title=Buddhist scriptures as literature: sacred rhetoric and the uses of theory |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xq76kvMGAjoC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=psychonaut#v=onepage&amp;q=psychonauts&amp;f=false |accessdate=2010-03-05 |isbn=978-0-7914-7339-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sensory deprivation]],&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt; and archaic/modern drug users who use [[entheogen]]ic substances in order to gain deeper insights and spiritual experiences.&lt;ref name="toxicology"&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Riel |year=2007 |title=New Drugs of Abuse |journal=Clinical Toxicology |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=372–3 |doi=10.1080/15563650701284894 |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=7439632&amp;q=psychonaut&amp;uid=789091652 |accessdate=2010-03-05 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who uses altered states for such exploration is known as a '''psychonaut'''.

==Etymology and categorization==
The term ''psychonautics'' derives from the prior term ''psychonaut'', usually attributed to [[Germany|German]] author [[Ernst Jünger]] who used the term in describing [[Arthur Heffter]] in his 1970 essay on his own extensive drug experiences ''Annäherungen: Drogen und Rausch'' (literally: "Approaches: Drugs and Inebriation").&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jünger |title=Annaherungen: Drogen und Rausch |pages=430 |chapter=Psychonauten}} Cited in {{cite book |last=Taylor|title=The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature |page=1312 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9kgUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=psychonaut+%22Annaherungen:+Drogen+und+Rausch%22&amp;dq=psychonaut+%22Annaherungen:+Drogen+und+Rausch%22&amp;cd=2 |accessdate=2010-03-05 | year=2005 | publisher=Thoemmes Continuum|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Jünger draws many parallels between drug experience and physical exploration—for example, the danger of encountering hidden "reefs."

[[Peter J. Carroll]] made ''Psychonaut'' the title of a 1982 book on the experimental use of [[meditation]], [[ritual]] and [[drugs]] in the experimental exploration of consciousness and of [[psychic phenomena]], or "[[chaos magic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Peter J. |title=''Liber Null''. (1978) and ''Psychonaut''. (1982) (published in one volume in 1987) |isbn=0-87728-639-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term's first published use in a scholarly context is attributed to [[ethnobotany|ethnobotanist]] [[Jonathan Ott]], in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |title=Pharmanopo-Psychonautics: Human Intranasal, Sublingual, Intrarectal, Pulmonary and Oral Pharmacology of Bufotenine |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=273–282 |url=http://direct.bl.uk/bld/PlaceOrder.do?UIN=103562030&amp;ETOC=RN |accessdate=2010-03-05 |doi=10.1080/02791072.2001.10400574 |last1=Ott |first1=Jonathan |pmid=11718320}} Cited by {{cite book |last=Blom |first=Jan Dirk |title=A Dictionary of Hallucinations |page=434 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qbF44AEMGdcC&amp;pg=PA434 |accessdate=2010-03-05 | isbn=978-1-4419-1222-0 | year=2009 | publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition and usage===
Clinical psychiatrist Jan Dirk Blom describes psychonautics as denoting "the exploration of the psyche by means of techniques such as [[lucid dreaming]], [[brainwave entrainment]], [[sensory deprivation]], and the use of [[hallucinogenic]]s or [[entheogen]]s", and a psychonaut as one who "seeks to investigate their mind using intentionally induced altered states of consciousness" for spiritual, scientific, or research purposes.&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt;

Psychologist Dr. Elliot Cohen of Leeds Metropolitan University and the UK Institute of Psychosomanautics defines psychonautics as "the means to study and explore consciousness (including the unconscious) and altered states of consciousness; it rests on the realization that to study consciousness is to transform it." He associates it with a long tradition of historical cultures worldwide.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;UK Institute of Psychonautics and Somanautics [http://www.transpersonalacademy.co.uk/psychonautics.htm page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110073128/http://www.transpersonalacademy.co.uk/psychonautics.htm |date=10 November 2010 }} at his {{cite web |url=http://www.transpersonalacademy.co.uk |title=Academy for Transpersonal Studies |accessdate=10 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923100000/http://www.transpersonalacademy.co.uk/ |archive-date=23 September 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leeds Metropolitan University is currently the only university in the UK to offer a module in Psychonautics.

American Buddhist writer [[Robert Thurman]] depicts the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[yogi|master]] as a psychonaut, stating that "Tibetan lamas could be called psychonauts, since they journey across the frontiers of death into the in-between realm."&lt;ref name="flores"/&gt;

===Categorization===
The aims and methods of psychonautics, when state-altering substances are involved, is commonly distinguished from [[recreational drug use]] by research sources.&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt; Psychonautics as a means of exploration need not involve drugs, and may take place in a religious context with an established history. Cohen considers psychonautics closer in association to wisdom traditions and other transpersonal and integral movements.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

However, there is considerable overlap with [[drug culture|modern drug use]] and due to its modern close association with [[psychedelics]] and other drugs it is also studied in the context of [[drug abuse]] from a perspective of addiction,&lt;ref name="addiction research"/&gt; the drug abuse market and [[online]] psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/109493103322278790 |last1=Schifano |date = August 2003|first1=Fabrizio |last2=Leoni |first2=Mauro |last3=Martinotti |first3=Giovanni |last4=Rawaf |first4=Salman |last5=Rovetto |first5=Francesco |title=Importance of Cyberspace for the Assessment of the Drug Abuse Market: Preliminary Results from the Psychonaut 2002 Project |journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior |volume=6 |pages=405–410 |url=http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089%2F109493103322278790 |accessdate=2010-03-05 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies into existing and emerging drugs within [[toxicology]].&lt;ref name="toxicology"/&gt;

* [[Hallucinogens]], &lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt; [[oneirogen|oneirogens]], and especially [[psychedelic drug|psychedelics]] such as [[peyote]], [[psilocybin mushroom]]s, [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] and [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], but also [[dissociative]]s and ''atypical'' psychedelics such as [[ketamine]], [[dextromethorphan]], ''[[Tabernanthe iboga]]'', ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' and ''[[Salvia divinorum]]''
* [[Icaro]]s, which are the songs (i.e. something verbal that is ordinarily perceived as an auditory sensation) the [[Ayahuasca|Ayahuasceros]] sing to induce pictorial representations, rich tapestries of colors and patterns that are visually seen by the listener. (See: [[synesthesia]]) The ayahuasca ingredient, harmine, was once known as telepathine because of this group-facilitated activity of singing icaros and the shared perception it cultivates. A shaman who is one of the Ayahuascero people is expected to memorize as many icaros as they can. 
* Disruption of psychological and physiological processes required for usual mental states - [[sleep deprivation]], [[fasting]], [[isolation tank|sensory deprivation]],&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt; [[oxygen deprivation]]/[[smoke inhalation]], [[holotropic breathwork]]
* [[Ritual]], both as a means of inducing an altered state, and also for practical purposes of [[wikt:grounding|grounding]] and of obtaining suitable focus and intention
* [[Dream]]ing, in particular [[lucid dreaming]]&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt; in which the person retains a degree of volition and awareness, and [[dream journal]]s
* [[Hypnosis]]&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt;
* [[Meditation]]&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt;
* Meditative or [[trance]] inducing dance, like [[Sufi whirling]] can also be used to induce altered state of consciousness
* [[Prayer]]&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt;
* [[Biofeedback]] and other devices that change neural activity in the [[brain]] ([[brainwave entrainment]])&lt;ref name="dictionary of hallucinations"/&gt; by means of light, sound, or electrical impulses, including: [[mind machines]], [[dreamachine]]s, [[binaural beats]], and [[cranial electrotherapy stimulation]]

These may be used in combination; for example, traditions such as shamanism may combine ritual, fasting, and hallucinogenic substances.

'''Rape''' is a type of [[sexual assault]] usually involving [[sexual intercourse]] or other forms of [[sexual penetration]] carried out against a person without that person's [[consent]].

Widespread and systematic rape (e.g., [[war rape]]) and [[sexual slavery]] can occur during international conflict. These practices are [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crime]]s. Rape is also recognized as an element of the crime of [[genocide]] when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted ethnic group.

== Etymology ==

The term ''rape'' originates from the [[Latin language|Latin]] [[wikt:Special:Search/rapere|''rapere'']] (supine stem ''raptum''), "to snatch, to grab, to carry off".&lt;ref name = "cor"&gt;Corinne J. Saunders, ''Rape and Ravishment in the Literature of Medieval England'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2001, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Kei"&gt;Keith Burgess-Jackson, ''A Most Detestable Crime: New Philosophical Essays on Rape'', Oxford University Press, New York, 1999, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 14th century, the term has come to mean "to seize and take away by force".&lt;ref name="merriam-webster.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=Rape |publisher=''[[Merriam-Webster]]'' |date= |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rape%5B3%5D}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman law, the carrying off of a woman by force, with or without intercourse, constituted "raptus".&lt;ref name = "Kei"/&gt; In [[Medieval English]] law the same term could refer to either kidnapping or rape in the modern sense of "sexual violation".&lt;ref name = "cor"/&gt; The original meaning of "carry off by force" is still found in some phrases, such as "rape and pillage", or in titles, such as the stories of the [[The Rape of the Sabine Women|Rape of the Sabine Women]] and [[Europa (mythology)|The Rape of Europa]] or the poem ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', which is about the theft of a lock of hair.

== Definitions ==
=== General ===
{{Main|Types of rape|Laws regarding rape}}
{{See also|Rape by gender}}
Rape is defined in most jurisdictions as [[sexual intercourse]], or other forms of [[sexual penetration]], committed by a perpetrator against a victim without their [[consent]].&lt;ref name="Book04"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=ed. by Merril D. |title=Encyclopedia of rape |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. [u.a.] |isbn=978-0-313-32687-5 |pages=169–170 |edition= 1st publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of rape is inconsistent between governmental health organizations, law enforcement, health providers, and legal professions.&lt;ref name="Maier2008" /&gt; It has varied historically and culturally.&lt;ref name="Book04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maier2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Maier |first1=S. L. |title="I Have Heard Horrible Stories...": Rape Victim Advocates' Perceptions of the Revictimization of Rape Victims by the Police and Medical System |journal=Violence Against Women |volume=14 |issue=7 |year=2008 |pages=786–808 |issn=1077-8012 |doi=10.1177/1077801208320245|pmid=18559867 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, ''rape'' had no sexual connotation and is still used in other contexts in English. In [[Roman law]], it or ''raptus'' was classified as a form of ''crimen vis'', "crime of assault".&lt;ref&gt;[[Justinian]], ''Institutiones'' [http://www.constitution.org/sps/sps02_j1-4.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary on Roman Law'', pp. 667 (''raptus'') and 768 (''vis'') [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=iklePELtR6QC }}]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Raptus'' described the abduction of a woman against the will of the man under whose authority she lived, and sexual intercourse was not a necessary element. Other definitions of rape have changed over time.

Until 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) considered rape a crime solely committed by men against women. In 2012, they changed their definition from "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will" to "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or [[Oral sex|oral penetration]] by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The previous definition, which had remained unchanged since 1927, was considered outdated and narrow. The updated definition includes recognizing any gender of victim and perpetrator and that rape with an object can be as traumatic as penile/vaginal rape. The bureau further describes instances when the victim is unable to give consent because of mental or physical incapacity. It recognizes that a victim can be incapacitated by drugs and alcohol and unable to give valid consent. The definition does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level; it rather means that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |title=An Updated Definition of Rape (U.S. Dept of Justice, January 6, 2012) |publisher= |accessdate=30 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313021145/http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |archivedate=13 March 2012 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html|title=Federal Crime Statistics to Expand Rape Definition|journal=The New York Times|first=Charlie|last=Savage|date=14 April 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health organizations and agencies have also expanded rape beyond traditional definitions. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines rape as a form of [[sexual assault]],&lt;ref name="WHO2002"&gt;{{cite web |title=WORLD REPORT ON VIOLENCE AND HEALTH |publisher=World Health Organization |page=149 |date=2002 |access-date=5 December 2015 |editor1-last=Krug |editor1-first=Etienne G. |displayeditors=etal |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/42495/1/9241545615_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) includes rape in their definition of sexual assault; they term rape a form of [[sexual violence]]. The CDC lists other acts of coercive, non-consensual sexual activity that may or may not include rape, including [[drug-facilitated sexual assault]], acts in which a victim is made to penetrate a perpetrator or someone else, intoxication where the victim is unable to consent (due to incapacitation or being unconscious), non-physically forced penetration which occurs after a person is pressured verbally (by intimidation or misuse of authority to force to consent), or completed or attempted forced penetration of a victim via unwanted physical force (including using a weapon or threatening to use a weapon).&lt;ref name = cdcstats&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv_surveillance_definitionsl-2009-a.pdf |accessdate=6 June 2017 |date=2014 |publisher=National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |title=Sexual Violence Surveillance: Uniform Definitions and Recommended Data Elements, Version 2.0. |last1=Basile |first1=KC |last2=Smith |first2=SG |last3=Breiding |first3=MJ |last4=Black |first4=MC |last5=Mahendra |first5=RR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016&gt;{{cite book |last=Markovchick |first=Vincent |title=Emergency medicine secrets |publisher=Elsevier |location=Philadelphia, PA |year=2016 |isbn=9780323355162 |pages=516–520 |chapter=Sexual Assault}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries or jurisdictions differentiate between rape and sexual assault by defining rape as involving penile penetration of the vagina, or solely penetration involving the penis, while other types of non-consensual sexual activity are called sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalbfleisch |first1=Pamela J. |last2=Cody |first2=Michael J. |title=Gender Power and Communication in Human Relationships |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2012 |pages= |accessdate=April 30, 2013 |isbn=978-1-136-48050-8 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=LyMo1RUJwj0C |page=218}} |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plummer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ken Plummer |title=Modern Homosexualities: Fragments of Lesbian and Gay Experiences |publisher=[[Routledge]] |year=2002 |pages=187–191 |accessdate=August 24, 2013 |isbn=978-1-134-92242-0 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=OSO3q4XEfz4C |page=189}} |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland, for example, emphasizes penile penetration, requiring that the sexual assault must have been committed by use of a penis to qualify as rape.&lt;ref name="legislation.gov.uk, rape"&gt;{{cite news |title=Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009 |publisher=legislation.gov.uk/[[UK Statute Law Database]] |year=2009 |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2009/9/section/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News, rape"&gt;{{cite news |authors=Tom de Castella, Jon Kelly |title=Assange case: How is rape defined? |publisher=BBC News |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19333439}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] defines rape as "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person under circumstances which are coercive".&lt;ref name="Book04" /&gt; In other cases, the term ''rape'' has been phased out of legal use in favor of terms such as ''sexual assault'' or ''criminal sexual conduct''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msu.edu/~sdclub/resources/criminal%20code.doc |title=Criminal code |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scope ===

Victims of rape or sexual assault come from a wide range of [[gender]]s, ages, [[sexual orientation]]s, ethnicitities, geographical locations, cultures and degrees of impairment or disability. Incidences of rape are classified into a number of categories, and they may describe the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim and the context of the sexual assault. These include [[date rape]], [[gang rape]], [[marital rape]], [[incest|incestual rape]], [[child sexual abuse]], [[prison rape]], [[acquaintance rape]], [[war rape]] and [[statutory rape]]. Forced sexual activity can be committed over a long period of time with little to no physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soc.ucsb.edu/sexinfo/article/rape |title=UCSB's SexInfo |publisher=Soc.ucsb.edu |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosdahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosdahl |first=Caroline |title=Textbook of basic nursing |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Philadelphia |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-60547-772-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelly2011" /&gt;

=== Consent ===

Lack of consent is key to the definition of rape.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com" /&gt;  Consent is affirmative "informed approval, indicating a freely given agreement" to sexual activity.&lt;ref name="cdcstats" /&gt; It is not necessarily expressed verbally, and may instead be overtly implied from actions, but the absence of objection does not constitute consent.&lt;ref name="Gruber2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gruber |first=Aya |date=December 2016 |title=Consent Confusion |url=http://scholar.law.colorado.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1010&amp;context=articles |journal=Cardozo Law Review |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=415–458|access-date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of consent may result from either forcible compulsion by the perpetrator or an inability to consent on the part of the victim (such as people who are asleep, intoxicated or otherwise mentally compromised).&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/ior53/001/2011/en/ Rape and sexual violence: Human rights law and standards in the International Criminal Court] . Amnesty International 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexual intercourse with a person below the [[age of consent]], i.e., the age at which legal competence is established, is referred to as statutory rape.&lt;ref name="thefreedictionary.com" /&gt;

[[Duress]] is the situation when the person is threatened by force or violence, and may result in the absence of an objection to sexual activity. This can lead to the presumption of consent.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org" /&gt; Duress may be actual or threatened force or violence against the victim or someone close to the victim. Even [[blackmail]] may constitute duress. [[Abuse of power]] may constitute duress. For instance, in the Philippines, a man commits rape if he engages in sexual intercourse with a woman ''"By means of fraudulent machination or grave abuse of authority"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno8353.htm REPUBLIC ACT NO. 8353]. Philippine Law. Approved: September 30, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in its landmark 1998 judgment used a definition of rape which did not use the word 'consent': "a physical invasion of a sexual nature committed on a person ''under circumstances which are coercive''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unictr.org/Portals/0/English%5CAnnualReports%5Ca-54-315.pdf Fourth Annual Report of ICTR to the General Assembly (1999)] March 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Marital rape, or spousal rape, is non-consensual sex in which the perpetrator is the victim's spouse. It is a form of [[Sexual violence by intimate partners|partner rape]], [[domestic violence]], and sexual abuse. Once widely accepted or ignored by law, spousal rape is now denounced by international conventions and is increasingly criminalized. Still, in many countries, spousal rape either remains legal, or is illegal but widely tolerated and accepted as a husband's prerogative. In 2006, the UN Secretary-General's ''In-depth study on all forms of violence against women'' stated that (pg 113): "Marital rape may be prosecuted in at least 104 states. Of these, 32 have made marital rape a specific criminal offence, while the remaining 74 do not exempt marital rape from general rape provisions. Marital rape is not a prosecutable offense in at least 53 States. Four States criminalize marital rape only when the spouses are judicially separated. Four States are considering legislation that would allow marital rape to be prosecuted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/vaw/publications/English%20Study.pdf |title=VAW/for printer/1/14/0 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, several other states have outlawed marital rape (for example [[Thailand]] in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6225872.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &amp;#124; Thailand passes marital rape bill |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-06-21 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In the US, the criminalization of marital rape started in the mid-1970s and in 1993 North Carolina became the last state to make marital rape illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1957&amp;dat=19930702&amp;id=_xYxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UOEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6288,228462 |title=The Daily Gazette&amp;nbsp;— Google News Archive Search |publisher= |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries, it is not clear if marital rape may or may not be prosecuted under ordinary rape laws. In the absence of a spousal rape law, it may be possible to bring prosecution for acts of forced sexual intercourse inside marriage by prosecuting, through the use of other criminal offenses (such as assault based offenses), the acts of violence or criminal threat that were used to obtain submission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Search |url=http://www.aware.org.sg/rape/ |title=Rape &amp; Sexual Assault &amp;#124; AWARE Singapore |publisher=Aware.org.sg |accessdate=2014-02-12|date=2011-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consent may be complicated by law, language, context, culture and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Kulick2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kulick |first1=Don |title=No |journal=Language &amp; Communication |volume=23 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=139–151 |issn=0271-5309 |doi=10.1016/S0271-5309(02)00043-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that men consistently perceive women's actions as more sexual than they intend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | chapter-url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-rape/#MenRea|title=Mens rea|chapter=Feminist Perspectives on Rape|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, verbalized 'no' to sex may be interpreted as 'keep trying', or even 'yes' by offenders. Some may believe that when injuries are not visible, the woman must have consented. If a man solicits sex from another man, the pursuer may be regarded as virile.&lt;ref name="Kulick2003"/&gt;

== Motives ==
{{further|Causes of sexual violence}}
The WHO states that the principal factors that lead to the perpetration of sexual violence against women, including rape, are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=WHO | author-link = World Health Organization |title=Violence against women |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs239/en/ |website=who.int |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |date=23 November 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* beliefs in family honor and sexual purity;
* attitudes of [[male entitlement|male sexual entitlement]];
* weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.

== Effects ==
One metric used by the WHO to determine the severity of global rates of coercive, forced sexual activity was the question "Have you ever
been forced to have sexual intercourse against your will?" Asking this question produced higher positive response rates than being asked, whether they had ever been abused or raped.&lt;ref name="Krug2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Krug |title=Rapport mondial sur la violence et la santé |year=2002 |publisher=Organisation mondiale de la santé |location=Genève |isbn=978-92-4-154561-7 |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/full_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women may not identify their victimization as rape for many reasons such as feelings of shame, embarrassment, non-uniform legal definitions, reluctance to define the friend/partner as a rapist, or because they have internalized victim-blaming attitudes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The public perceives these behaviors as 'counterintuitive' and therefore, as evidence of a dishonest woman.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Dissociation can occur during the assault.&lt;ref name="Psych2013rev" /&gt;  Memories may be fragmented especially immediately afterwards. They may consolidate with time and sleep.&lt;ref name="Psych2013rev" /&gt;  A man or boy who is raped may be stimulated and even ejaculate during the experience of the rape.

Trauma symptoms may not show until years after the sexual assault occurred. Immediately following a rape, the survivor may react outwardly in a wide range of ways, from expressive to closed down; common emotions include distress, anxiety, shame, revulsion, helplessness, and guilt.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt; Denial is not uncommon.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;

In the weeks following the rape, the survivor may develop symptoms of [[post traumatic stress syndrome]] and may develop wide array of psychosomatic complaints.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoffman2016&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hoffman |first1=Barbara, et al. |title=Williams Gynecology |date=2016 |publisher=McGraw Hill Professional |isbn=9780071849098 |edition= 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|310}} PTSD symptoms include re-experiencing of the rape, avoiding things associated with the rape, numbness, and increased anxiety and [[startle response]].&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;  The likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is higher if the rapist confined or restrained the person, if the person being raped believed the rapist would kill them, the person who was raped was very young or very old, and if the rapist was someone they knew.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;  The likelihood of sustained severe symptoms is also higher if people around the survivor ignore (or are ignorant of) the rape or blame the rape survivor.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;

Most people recover from rape in three to four months, but many have persistent PTSD that may manifest in anxiety, depression, substance abuse, irritability, anger, flashbacks, or nightmares.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;  In addition, rape survivors may have long term [[generalised anxiety disorder]], may develop one or more [[specific phobia]]s, [[major depressive disorder]], and may experience difficulties with resuming their social life, and with sexual functioning.&lt;ref name=Psych2013rev/&gt;  People who have been raped are at higher risk of suicide.&lt;ref name=Male2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jina |first1=R |last2=Thomas |first2=LS |title=Health consequences of sexual violence against women. |journal=Best Practice &amp; Research.

Another effect of rape and sexual assault is the stress created in those who study rape or counsel the survivors. This is called [[vicarious traumatization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guidelines for the prevention and management of vicarious trauma among researchers of sexual and intimate partner violence |url=http://www.svri.org/sites/default/files/attachments/2016-06-02/SVRIVTguidelines.pdf |publisher=Sexual Violence Research Initiative |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence or absence of physical injury may be used to determine whether a rape has occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=G |title=The (in)significance of genital injury in rape and sexual assault. |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |date=August 2015 |volume=34 |pages=173–8 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2015.06.007 |pmid=26165680}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those who have experienced sexual assault yet have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=K.

While penetrative rape generally does not involve the use of a condom, in some cases a condom is used. This significantly reduces the likelihood of pregnancy and [[disease transmission]], both to the victim and to the rapist. Rationales for condom use include: avoiding contracting infections or diseases (particularly HIV), especially in cases of rape of [[sex worker]]s or in gang rape (to avoid contracting infections or diseases from fellow rapists); eliminating evidence, making prosecution more difficult (and giving a sense of invulnerability); giving the appearance of consent (in cases of acquaintance rape); and thrill from planning and the use of the condom as an added prop. Concern for the victim is generally not considered a factor.&lt;ref name="condom"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/22/nyregion/rapists-and-condoms-is-use-a-cavalier-act-or-a-way-to-avoid-disease-and-arrest.html |title=Rapists and Condoms; Is Use a Cavalier Act or a Way to Avoid Disease and Arrest? |first=Craig |last=Wolff |date=August 22, 1994 |newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Victim blaming, secondary victimization and other mistreatment ===
{{Main|Victim blaming|Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims}}
Society's treatment of victims has the potential to exacerbate their trauma.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; People who have been raped or sexually assaulted are sometimes blamed and considered responsible for the crime.&lt;ref name="Maier2008" /&gt; This refers to the [[just-world hypothesis|just world fallacy]] and [[Rape myth|rape myth acceptance]] that certain victim behaviors (such as being intoxicated, [[flirting]] or wearing sexually [[provocation (legal)|provocative]] clothing) may encourage rape.&lt;ref&gt;Pauwels, B.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Rape victims are blamed more when they resist the attack later in the rape encounter rather than earlier (Kopper, 1996), which seems to suggest the stereotype that these women are engaging in token resistance (Malamuth &amp; Brown, 1994; Muehlenhard &amp; Rogers, 1998) or leading the man on because they have gone along with the sexual experience thus far. Finally, rape victims are blamed more when they are raped by an acquaintance or a date rather than by a stranger (e.g., Bell, Kuriloff, &amp; Lottes, 1994; Bridges, 1991; Bridges &amp; McGr ail, 1989; Check &amp; Malamuth, 1983; Kanekar, Shaherwalla, Franco, Kunju, &amp; Pinto, 1991; L'Armand &amp; Pepitone, 1982; Tetreault &amp; Barnett, 1987), which seems to evoke the stereotype that victims really want to have sex because they know their attacker and perhaps even went out on a date with him. The underlying message of this research seems to be that when certain stereotypical elements of rape are in place, rape victims are prone to being blamed."&lt;ref name = bud2001/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For females, victim-blaming correlates with fear. Many rape victims blame themselves.

Thus, if rape occurs, it is considered to be at least partly the women’s fault and her virtue is called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R.

==== Honor killings and forced marriages ====

In many cultures, those who are raped have a high risk of suffering additional violence or threats of violence after the rape. This can be perpetrated by the rapist, friends, or relatives of the rapist. The intent can be to prevent the victim from reporting the rape.&amp;nbsp;Other reasons for threats against the those assaulted is to punish them for reporting it, or of forcing them to withdraw the complaint.&amp;nbsp;The relatives of the person who has been raped may wish to prevent "bringing shame" to the family and may also threaten them. This is especially the case in cultures where female virginity is highly valued and considered mandatory before marriage; in extreme cases, rape victims are killed in [[honor killings]].&lt;ref name="zeenews.india" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wisemuslimwomen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-17379721 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Morocco protest after raped Amina Filali kills herself |journal=BBC News |date=2012-03-15 |accessdate=2013-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[victims' rights]] include the right to have a victims advocate preside over every step of the medical/legal exam to ensure sensitivity towards victims, provide emotional support, and minimize the risk of re-traumatization. Victims are to be informed of this immediately by law enforcement or medical service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.victimlaw.org/victimlaw/pages/victimsRight.jsp |title=VictimLaw - Victims Right |website=www.victimlaw.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://victimsofcrime.org/help-for-crime-victims/get-help-bulletins-for-crime-victims/what-is-a-victim-advocate- |title=What is a Victim Advocate- |website=victimsofcrime.org|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergency department|Emergency room]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s of many hospitals employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced a rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence.&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=mci2017&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas K. |last=McInerny |date=2017 |title=Textbook of Pediatric Care - 2nd Edition |publisher=American Academy of Pediatrics |isbn=978-1-58110-966-5}}  [http://online.statref.com/Do STAT!Ref Online Electronic Medical Library]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Staff are also trained to explain the examinations in detail, the documentation and the rights associated with the requirement for [[informed consent]].

=== Non-genital injuries ===

====Physical assessment====
Many rapes do not result in serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=K. M. |title=Heterogeneity of Existing Research Relating to Sexual Violence, Sexual Assault and Rape Precludes Meta-analysis of Injury Data |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |year=2013 |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=447–459 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2013.02.002|pmid=23756514 |hdl=10147/296808 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[medical treatment|medical response]] to sexual assault is a complete assessment. This general assessment will prioritize the treatment of injuries by the [[emergency room]] staff. Medical personnel involved are trained to assess and treat those assaulted or follow protocols established to ensure privacy and best treatment practices. Informed consent is always required prior to treatment unless the person who was assaulted is unconscious, intoxicated or does not have the mental capacity to give consent.&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016/&gt;&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt; Priorities governing the physical exam are the treatment of serious life-threatening emergencies and then a general and complete assessment.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hockett |first1=Jericho M. |last2=Saucier |first2=Donald A. |title=A systematic literature review of "rape victims" versus "rape survivors": Implications for theory, research, and practice |journal=Aggression and Violent Behavior |volume=25 |year=2015 |pages=1–14 |issn=1359-1789 |doi=10.1016/j.avb.2015.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some physical injuries are readily apparent such as, [[human bites|bites]],&lt;ref name="NYJH" /&gt; broken teeth, [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]], [[bruising]], [[laceration]]s and scratches. In more [[violent]] cases, the victim may need to have gunshot wounds or [[stab wound]]s treated.&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016/&gt;  The loss of consciousness is relevant to the medical history.&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt;  If abrasions are found, [[immunization]] against [[tetanus]] is offered if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;

====Diagnostic testing====
After the general assessment and treatment of serious injuries, further evaluation may include the use of additional diagnostic testing such as [[x-rays]], [[computer-aided tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]] image studies and blood work. The presence of infection is determined by sampling of body fluids from the mouth, throat, vagina, [[perineum]], and [[anus]].&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt;

====Forensic sampling====
{{Main|Rape investigation}}
Victims have the right to refuse any evidence collection. Victims advocates ensure the victims' wishes are respected by hospital staff. After the physical injuries are addressed and treatment has begun, then [[Forensic science|forensic examination]] proceeds along with the gathering of evidence that can be used to identify and document the injuries.&lt;ref name=Markovchick2016/&gt; Such [[evidence]]-gathering is only done with the complete consent of the patient or the [[caregiver]]s of the patient. Photographs of the injuries may be requested by staff.&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt; At this point in the treatment, if a victims' advocate had not been requested earlier, experienced [[Counsel|social support staff]] are made available to the patient and family.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Barbara |title=Williams gynecology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-07-171672-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the patient or the caregivers, (typically parents) agree, the medical team utilizes standardized sampling and testing usually referred to a forensic evidence kit or "[[rape kit]]".&lt;ref name = mci2017/&gt; The patient is informed that submitting to the use of the rape kit does not [[obligation|obligate]] them to file [[criminal charges]] against the perpetrator. The patient is discouraged from bathing or showering for the purpose of obtaining samples from their hair.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; Evidence gathered within the past 72 hours is more likely to be valid.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt; The sooner that samples are obtained after the assault, the more likely that evidence is present in the sample and provide valid results. Once the injuries of the patient have been treated and she or he is stabilized, the sample gathering will begin. Staff will encourage the presence of a rape/sexual assault counselor to provide an advocate and reassurance.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

During the medical exam, evidence of bodily secretions is assessed. Dried semen that is on clothing and skin can be detected with a fluorescent lamp.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Semen fluoresces best at wavelengths of 420 and 450 nm, when viewed through orange goggles. A Wood lamp emits light at only 360-nm wavelength. Therefore specialized alternate light sources that emit wavelengths at 420 and 450 nm, such as a Bluemaxx, should be used. Although this type of lamp will improve the detection of dried semen, many other substances will fluoresce as well; thus, confirmation of semen cannot be made with this method.", McInerny (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;  Notes will be attached to those items on which semen has been found. These specimens are marked, placed in a paper bag,&lt;ref&gt;This practice discourages the growth of microorganisms which could alter analysis. Cybulska&lt;/ref&gt; and be marked for later analysis for the presence of seminal vesicle-specific antigen.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cybulska2013"/&gt;

Though technically, medical staff are not part of the legal system, only trained medical personnel can obtain evidence that is admissible during a trial. The procedures have been standardized. Evidence is collected, signed, and locked in a secure place to guarantee that legal evidence procedures are maintained. This is known as the [[chain of evidence]] and is a legal term that describes a carefully monitored procedure of evidence collection and preservation. Maintaining the Chain of evidence from the medical examination, testing and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] sampling from its origin of collection to court allows the results of the sampling to be admitted as evidence.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; The use of photography is often used for documentation.&lt;ref name="VAW2013" /&gt;&lt;!-- p 95 --&gt;

===After the examination===
Some physical effects of the rape are not immediately apparent. Follow up examinations also assess the patient for [[tension headaches]], [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], sleep pattern disturbances, gastrointestinal irritability, chronic pelvic pain, menstrual pain or irregularity, pelvic inflammatory disease, multiple yeast infections, sexual dysfunction, premenstrual distress, fibromyalgia, vaginal discharge, vaginal itching, burning during urination, and generalized vaginal pain.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt;

Women are typically offered [[contraceptive]] medications because about 5% of male-on-female rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis"&gt;{{cite book |author=Varcarolis, Elizabeth |year=2013 |title=Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing |location=St. Louis |publisher=Elsevier |pages=439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genital injuries ===

An internal pelvic exam is not recommended for sexually immature or prepubescent girls due to the probability that internal injuries do not exist in this age group. An internal exam may be recommended if significant bloody discharge is observed, though.&lt;ref name="mci2017" /&gt; A complete [[pelvic exam]] for rape ([[anal rape|anal]] or vaginal) is conducted. An [[dentistry|oral exam]] is done if there have been [[injurie]]s to the mouth, teeth, gums or [[pharynx]]. Though the patient may have no complaints about [[genital pain]] signs of trauma can still be assessed. Prior to the complete bodily and genital exam, the patient is asked to undress, standing on a white sheet that collects any [[debris]] that may be in the clothing. The clothing and sheet are properly bagged and labeled along with other samples that can be removed from the body or clothing of the patient. Samples of [[fiber]]s, mud, hair, leaves are gathered if present. Samples of [[body fluid|fluids]] are collected to determine the presence of the perpetrator's [[saliva]] and [[semen]] that may be present in the patients mouth, [[vagina]] or [[rectum]]. Sometimes the victim has [[Abrasion (medical)|scratched]] the perpetrator in defense and fingernail scrapings can be collected.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

Injuries to the genital areas can be swelling, lacerations, and bruising.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Health &amp; physical assessment in nursing|last=Donita|first=D'Amico|publisher=|others=Barbarito, Colleen|isbn=9780133876406|edition= 3rd|location=Boston|pages=664|oclc=894626609|date = 2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common genital injuries are [[Rectal pain|anal injury]], labial abrasions, hymenal bruising, tears of the posterior [[Frenulum of labia minora|fourchette]] and fossa.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; Bruises, tears, abrasions, inflammation and lacerations may be visible. If a foreign object was used during the assault, x-ray visualization will identify retained fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kr6ZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Forensic Gynaecology|last=Dalton|first=Maureen|date=2014-10-09|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107064294|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genital injuries are more prevalent in [[post-menopausal]] women and [[prepubescent]] girls. Internal injuries to the [[cervix]] and vagina can be visualized using [[colposcopy]]. Using colposcopy has increased the detection of internal trauma from six percent to fifty-three percent. Genital injuries to children who have been raped or sexually assaulted differ in that the abuse may be on-going or it happened in the past after the injuries heal. [[Scar]]ring is one sign of the sexual abuse of children.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

Several studies have explored the association between skin color and genital injury among rape victims. Many studies found a difference in rape-related injury based on race, with more injuries being reported for white females and males than for black females and males. This may be because the dark skin color of some victims obscures bruising. Examiners paying attention to victims with darker skin, especially the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette, and fossa navicularis, can help remedy this.&lt;ref&gt;Baker RB, Fargo JD, Shambley-Ebron D, Sommers MS. A source of healthcare disparity: Race, skin color, and injuries after rape among adolescents and young adults. Journal of Forensic Nursing, 2010; 6: 144-150&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infections ===

The presence of a sexually contracted infection can not be confirmed after rape because it cannot be detected until 72 hours afterwards.&lt;ref name = marc2015&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcdante |first=Karen |title=Nelson essentials of pediatrics |publisher=Elsevier/Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-4557-5980-4}}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--no page numbers--&gt;

The person who was raped may already have a sexually transmitted bacterial, viral and other infections and if diagnosed, it is treated.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;&lt;ref name=VAW2013/&gt;&lt;!-- p 111 --&gt; Prophylactic antibiotic treatment for [[vaginitis]], [[gonorrhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] may be done. Chlamydial and gonococcal infections in women are of particular concern due to the possibility of ascending infection. [[Immunization]] against [[Hepatitis B vaccination|hepatitis B]] is often considered.&lt;ref name = marc2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cybulska2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cybulska |first1=Beata |title=Immediate medical care after sexual assault |journal=Best Practice &amp; Research Clinical Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology |volume=27 |issue=1 |year=2013 |pages=141–149 |issn=1521-6934 |doi=10.1016/j.bpobgyn.2012.08.013|pmid=23200638 }}&lt;sup&gt;[subscription required]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  After prophylactic treatment is initiated, further testing is done to determine what other treatments may be necessary for other infections transmitted during the assault.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt; These are:

* Serum [[hepatitis B]] surface antigen assay
* Microscopic evaluation of [[vaginal discharge]] (saline wash and staining)
* [[Microbiological culture|Cultures]] for [[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]] and Chlamydia trachomatis from each penetrated location
* [[Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test|Serum Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test]]
* [[Complete blood count]] (CBC)
* [[Liver function tests]]
* [[Creatinine|Serum creatinine level]]&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;

Treatment may include the administration of [[zidovudine]]/[[lamivudine]], [[tenofovir]]/[[emtricitabine]], [[ritonavir]]/[[lopinavir]]. Information regarding other treatment options are available from the CDC.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;

The transmission of HIV is frequently a major concern of the patient.&lt;ref name=VAW2013/&gt;&lt;!-- p 111 --&gt; Prophylactic treatment for HIV is not necessarily administered. Routine treatment for HIV after rape or sexual assault is controversial due to the low risk of infection after one sexual assault. Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative anal sex is estimated to be 0.5 to 3.2 percent. Transmission of HIV after one exposure to penetrative vaginal intercourse is 0.05 to 0.15 percent. HIV can also be contracted through the oral route but is considered rare.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Antiretroviral Postexposure Prophylaxis After Sexual, Injection-Drug Use, or Other Nonoccupational Exposure to HIV in the United States |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=21 January 2005 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5402a1.htm |accessdate=2015-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other recommendations are that the patient be treated prophylactically for HIV if the perpetrator is found to be infected.&lt;ref name="NYJH"&gt;{{cite web |title=HIV Clinical Resource: HIV Prophylaxis for Victims of Sexual Assault |publisher=Office of the Medical Director, New York State Department of Health AIDS Institute in Collaboration with Johns Hopkins University Division of Infectious Disease |url=http://www.hivguidelines.org/clinical-guidelines/post-exposure-prophylaxis/hiv-prophylaxis-for-victims-of-sexual-assault/ |accessdate=2015-12-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130135/http://www.hivguidelines.org/clinical-guidelines/post-exposure-prophylaxis/hiv-prophylaxis-for-victims-of-sexual-assault/|archivedate=2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing at the time of the initial exam does not typically have forensic value if patients are sexually active and have an STI since it could have been acquired prior to the assault. Rape shield laws protect the person who was raped and who has positive test results. These laws prevent having such evidence used against someone who was raped. Someone who was raped may be concerned that a prior infection may suggest sexual promiscuity. There may, however, be situations in which testing has the legal purpose, as in cases where the threat of transmission or actual transmission of an STI was part of the crime. In nonsexually active patients, an initial, baseline negative test that is followed by a subsequent STI could be used as evidence, if the perpetrator also had an STI.&lt;ref name=VAW2013/&gt;&lt;!-- p 111 --&gt;

Treatment failure is possible due to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of pathogens.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baarda |first1=Benjamin I. |last2=Sikora |first2=Aleksandra E. |title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology |volume=6 |pages=1190 |year=2015 |issn=1664-302X |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190|pmid=26579097 |pmc=4620152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotional and psychiatric ===

Psychiatric and emotional consequences can be apparent immediately after rape and it may be necessary to treat these very early in the evaluation and treatment.&lt;ref name=VAW2013&gt;{{cite book |title=Violence Against Women |date=April 2013 |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice - Office of Violence Against Women |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ovw/241903.pdf |accessdate=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other treatable emotional and psychiatric disorders may not become evident after the rape. These can be [[Eating disorder|eating]] disorders, anxiety, fear, intrusive thoughts, fear of crowds, avoidance, anger, depression, humiliation, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) hyperarousal, sexual disorders,(including fear of engaging in sexual activity), mood disorders, suicidal ideation, borderline personality disorder, nightmares, fear of situations that remind the patient of the rape and fear of being alone,&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt; [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]], [[numbness]] and emotional distance.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012" /&gt; Victims are able to receive help by using a telephone hotline, [[counseling]], or shelters.&lt;ref name="Rosdahl" /&gt; Recovery from sexual assault is a complicated and controversial concept,&lt;ref name="Recovering from sexual assault" /&gt; but support groups, usually accessed by [[List of anti-sexual assault organizations in the United States|organizations]] are available to help in recovery. Professional counseling and on-going treatment by trained health care providers is often sought by the victim.&lt;ref name="Bud2015"&gt;{{cite book |last=Budrionis |first=Rita |title=The sexual abuse victim and sexual offender treatment planner, with DSM-5 updates |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-119-07481-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are clinicians who are specially trained in the treatment of those who have experienced rape and sexual assault/abuse. Treatment can be lengthy and be challenging for both the counselor and the patient. Several treatment options exist and vary by accessibility, cost, or whether or not insurance coverage exists for the treatment. Treatment also varies dependent upon the expertise of the counselor—some have more experience and or have specialized in the treatment of sexual trauma and rape. To be the most effective, a treatment plan should developed based upon the struggles of the patient and not necessarily based upon the traumatic experience. An effective treatment plan will take the following into consideration: current stressors, coping skills, physical health, interpersonal conflicts, self-esteem, family issues, involvement of the guardian, and the presence of mental health symptoms.
&lt;ref name="Bud2015" /&gt;

The degree of success for emotional and psychiatric treatments is often dependent upon the terminology used in the treatment, i.e. redefining the event and experience. Labels used like "rape victim" and "rape survivor" to describe the new identities of women who have been raped suggest that the event is the dominant and controlling influence on her life. These may have an effect on supportive personnel. The consequences of using these labels needs to be assessed.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt; Positive outcomes of emotional and psychiatric treatment for rape exist; these can be an improved self-concept, the recognition of growth, and implementing new coping styles.&lt;ref name="HockettSaucier2015" /&gt;

A perpetrator found guilty by the court is often required to receive treatment. There are many options for treatment, some more successful than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Saleh |first=Fabian |title=Sex offenders identification, risk assessment, treatment, and legal issues |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford New York |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-517704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological factors that motivated the convicted perpetrator are complex but treatment can still be effective. A counselor will typically evaluate disorders that are currently present in the offender. Investigating the developmental background of the offender can help explain the origins of the abusive behavior occurred in the first place. Emotional and psychological treatment has the purpose of identifying predictors of recidivism, or the potential that the offender will commit rape again. In some instances neurological abnormalities have been identified in the perpetrators, and in some cases they have themselves experienced past trauma. Adolescents and other children can be the perpetrators of rape, although this is uncommon. In this instance, appropriate counseling and evaluation are usually conducted.&lt;ref name="Kelly2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Gary |title=Sexuality today |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York, NY |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-07-353199-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD|post traumatic stress disorder]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name="Varcarolis" /&gt;

Most rape research and reports of rape are limited to male-female forms of rape. Research [[Rape of males|on male-on-male and female-on-male rape]] is rare. Fewer than one in ten male-male rapes are reported. As a group, males who have been raped by either gender often get little services and support, and legal systems are often ill-equipped to deal with this type of crime. Instances in which the perpetrator is female, are not clear and lead to the denial of women being sexual aggressors. This could obscure the dimensions of the problem. Research also suggests that men with sexually aggressive peers have a higher chance of reporting coercive or forced sexual intercourse outside gang circles than men without such sexually aggressive peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gwartney-Gibbs PA, Stockard J, Bohmer S |title=Learning courtship aggression: the influence of parents, peers and personal experiences- |journal=[[Family Relations (journal)|Family Relations]] |year=1983 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=276–282 |doi=10.2307/583540 |jstor=583540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conviction ===

== False accusation ==
{{Main|False accusation of rape}}

A false accusation of rape is the reporting of a rape where no rape has occurred. It is difficult to assess the true prevalence of false rape allegations, but it's generally agreed by scholars that rape accusations are false about 2% to 10% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;DiCanio, M. (1993). ''The encyclopedia of violence: origins, attitudes, consequences''. New York: Facts on File. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-2332-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf|title=Statistics about sexual violence|last=|first=|date=2015|website=National Sexual Violence Resource Center|access-date=January 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lisak2010/&gt; In most cases, a false accusation will not name a specific suspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiser |first1=Dana M |title=Confronting Myths About Sexual Assault: A Feminist Analysis of the False Report Literature False Reports |journal=Family Relations |date=February 2017 |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=46 – 60 |doi=10.1111/fare.12235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight percent of 2,643 sexual assault cases were classified as false reports by the police in one study. The researchers noted that much of these classifications were based on the personal judgments and [[bias]]es of the police investigators and were made in violation of official criteria for establishing a [[false allegation]]. Closer analysis of this category applying the Home Office counting rules for establishing a false allegation, which requires "strong evidential grounds" of a false allegation or a "clear and credible" retraction by the complainant, reduced the percentage of false reports to 3%. The researchers concluded that "one cannot take all police designations at face value" and that "[t]here is an over-estimation of the scale of false allegations by both police officers and prosecutors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hors293.pdf|title=A gap or a chasm?

Another large-scale study was conducted in Australia, with the 850 rapes reported to the Victoria police between 2000 and 2003 (Heenan &amp; Murray, 2006). Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, the researchers examined 812 cases and found 15.1% of complaints were withdrawn, 46.4% were marked "no further police action", and 2.1% of the total were "clearly" classified by police as false reports. The researchers noted that where the police found a case to be a false allegation but didn't want to pursue charges against the accuser, they marked it as "no further police action" instead. All of these complainants were then charged or threatened with charges for filing a false police report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/app/abstractdb/AbstractDBDetails.aspx?id=243182 |title=Abstracts Database&amp;nbsp;— National Criminal Justice Reference Service |publisher=Ncjrs.gov |accessdate=2010-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) analyzed every rape complaint made over a 17-month period and found that "the indication is that it is therefore extremely rare that a suspect deliberately makes a false allegation of rape or domestic violence purely out of malice.".&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/03/13/false-rape-allegations-ra_n_2865823.html |title='Damaging Myths' About False Rape Accusations Harming Real Victims |last=UK |first=The Huffington Post |date=2013-03-13 |website=HuffPost UK|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.webcitation.org/6ItPWbBjp?url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/research/perverting_course_of_justice_march_2013.pdf Charging perverting the course of justice and wasting police time in cases involving allegedly false rape and domestic violence allegations]" Archived from: http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/research/perverting_course_of_justice_march_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
FBI reports consistently put the number of "unfounded" rape accusations around 8%. The unfounded rate is higher for forcible rape than for any other Index crime. The average rate of unfounded reports for Index crimes is 2%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091229015318/http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/Cius_97/96CRIME/96crime2.pdf Crime Index Offenses Reported].

Attorney General's Sexual Assault Task Force Oregon, US January 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Gross of the Forensic Examiner described it as meaningless, saying a report could be marked as unfounded if there is no physical evidence or the alleged victim did not sustain any physical injuries.

Other studies have suggested that the rate of false allegations in America may be higher. A nine-year study by Eugene J. Kanin of [[Purdue University]] in a small metropolitan area in the Midwestern United States claimed that 41% of rape accusations were false.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kanin |first=E.J. |title=An alarming national trend: False rape allegations |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=23 |number=1 |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[David Lisak]], an associate professor of psychology and director of the Men's Sexual Trauma Research Project at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]] states that "Kanin's 1994 article on false allegations is a provocative opinion piece, but it is not a scientific study of the issue of false reporting of rape". He further states that Kanin's study has significantly poor systematic methodology and had no independent definition of a false report. Instead, Kanin classified reports that the police department classified as false also as false.&lt;ref name="VAW2"&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Violence Against Women |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/16/12/1318.full.pdf+html |volume=16 |issue=12 |title=False Allegations of Sexual Assault: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases |first=David |last=Lisak |first2=Lori |last2=Gardinier |last3=Nicksa |first3=Sarah C. |first4=Ashley M. |last4=Cote |year=2010 |doi=10.1177/1077801210387747 |pages=1318&amp;ndash;1334 |pmid=21164210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criterion for falsehood was simply a denial of a polygraph test of the accuser.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; A 1998 report by the [[National Institute of Justice]] found that DNA evidence excluded the primary suspect in 26% of rape cases and concluded that this "strongly suggests that postarrest and postconviction DNA exonerations are tied to some strong, underlying systemic problems that generate erroneous accusations and convictions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/dnaevid.pdf |last1=Connors |first1=Edward |last2=Lundregan |first2=Thomas |last3=Miller |first3=Neal |last4=McEwen |first4=Tom |title=Convicted by Juries, Exonerated by Science: Case Studies in the Use of DNA Evidence to Establish Innocence After Trial |publisher=National Institute of Justice |date=June 1996 |pages=xxviii–xxix}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study also noted that analyzed samples involved a specific subset of rape cases (e.g. those where "there is no consent defense").

A 2010 study by David Lisak, Lori Gardinier and other researchers published in the journal of [[Violence Against Women (journal)|''Violence against Women'']] found that out of 136 cases reported in a ten-year period, 5.9% were found likely to be false.&lt;ref name=Lisak2010&gt;{{Cite journal |title=False Allegations of Sexual Assault: An Analysis of Ten Years of Reported Cases |url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/16/12/1318 |journal=Violence Against Women |date=2010-12-01 |issn=1077-8012 |pmid=21164210 |pages=1318–1334 |volume=16 |issue=12 |doi=10.1177/1077801210387747 |language=en |first=David |last=Lisak |first2=Lori |last2=Gardinier |first3=Sarah C. |last3=Nicksa |first4=Ashley M. |last4=Cote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of rape}}

=== Definitions and evolution of laws ===
Virtually all societies have had a concept of the crime of rape. Although what constituted this crime has varied by historical period and culture, the definitions tended to focus around an act of forced vaginal intercourse perpetrated through physical violence or imminent threat of death or severe bodily injury, by a man, on a woman or a girl, not his wife. The [[actus reus]] of the crime, was, in most societies, the insertion of the penis into the vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=mdZktFIzfCgC}} |title=Development of Global Prohibition Regimes: Pillage and Rape in War - Tuba Inal |publisher= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=X_w83yCJCOQC}} |title=The Routledge History of Sex and the Body: 1500 to the Present |publisher= |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way sexuality was conceptualized in many societies rejected the very notion that a woman could force a man into sex&amp;nbsp;— women were often seen as passive while men were deemed to be assertive and aggressive. Sexual penetration of a male by another male fell under the legal domain of [[sodomy]].

[[Rape law]]s existed to protect [[virgin]]al daughters from rape. In these cases, a rape done to a woman was seen as an attack on the estate of her father because she was his property and a woman's virginity being taken before marriage lessened her value; if the woman was married, the rape was an attack on the husband because it violated his property.&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teela Sanders|title=Sex Offenses and Sex Offenders|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2012|page=82|accessdate=28 January 2017|isbn =978-0190213633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rb5LDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yllö"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Kersti Yllö, M.

From the classical antiquity of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] into the [[Colonialism|Colonial period]], rape along with arson, [[treason]] and murder was a [[capital offense]]. "Those committing rape were subject to a wide range of capital punishments that were seemingly brutal, frequently bloody, and at times spectacular." In the 12th century, kinsmen of the victim were given the option of executing the punishment themselves. "In England in the early fourteenth century, a victim of rape might be expected to gouge out the eyes and/or sever the offender's testicles herself."&lt;ref&gt;"The Medieval Blood Sanction and the Divine Beneficene of Pain: 1100–1450", Trisha Olson, ''Journal of Law and Religion'', 22 JLREL 63 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the harshness of these laws, actual punishments were usually far less severe: in late Medieval Europe, cases concerning rapes of marriageable women, wives, widows, or members of the lower class were rarely brought forward, and usually ended with only a small monetary fine or a marriage between the victim and the rapist.&lt;ref name="Eckman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eckman |first=Zoe |url=http://medievalists.net/files/11020201.pdf |title=An Oppressive Silence: The Evolution of the Raped Woman in Medieval France and England |journal=Historian: Journal of the Undergraduate History Department at New York University |volume=50 |year=2009 |pages=68–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In ancient Greece and Rome, both male-on-female and male-on-male concepts of rape existed. Roman laws allowed three distinct charges for the crime: ''stuprum'', unsanctioned sexual intercourse (which, in the early times, also included adultery); ''vis'', a physical assault for purpose of lust; and ''iniuria'', a general charge denoting any type of assault upon person. Aforementioned ''Lex Iulia'' specifically criminalized ''per vim stuprum'', unsanctioned sexual intercourse by force. The former two were public criminal charges which could be brought whenever the victim was a woman or a child of either gender, but only if the victim was a freeborn Roman citizen (''[[ingenui|ingenuus]]''), and carried potential sentence of death or exile.  ''Iniuria'' was a civil charge that demanded monetary compensation, and had a wider application (for example, it could have been brought in case of sexual assault on a slave by a person other than their owner.) [[Augustus]] Caesar enacted reforms for the crime of rape under the assault statute ''Lex Iulia de vi publica'', which bears his family name, ''Iulia''. It was under this statute rather than the adultery statute of ''Lex Iulia de adulteriis'' that Rome prosecuted this crime.&lt;ref&gt;James Fitzjames Stephen, ''A History of the Criminal Law of England'', p. 17 [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=jecTHASFYeUC }}]&lt;/ref&gt; Rape was made into a "public wrong" (''iniuria publica'') by the Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;George Mousourakis, ''The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law'' p. 30 [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=8qE1zFHyGXoC }}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brundage, James A., "Rape and Seduction in Medieval Canon Law", in ''Sexual Practices and the Medieval Church'', edited by Vern L.

In contrast to the modern understanding of the subject, Romans drew clear distinctions between "active" (penetrative) and "passive" (receptive) partners, and all these charges implied penetration by the assailant (which necessarily ruled out the possibility of female-on-male or female-on-female rape.) It is not clear which (if any) of these charges applied to assaults upon an adult male, though such an assault upon a citizen was definitely seen as a grave insult (within Roman culture, an adult male citizen could not possibly consent to the receptive role in a sexual intercourse without a severe loss of status.) The law known as [[Lex Scantinia]] covered at least some forms of male-on-male ''stuprum'', and [[Quintillian]] mentions a fine of 10,000 sesterces – about 10 years worth of a Roman legionnaire's pay – as a normal penalty for ''stuprum'' upon an ''ingenuus''. However, its text is lost and its exact provisions are no longer known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&amp;context=mjgl |title=Roman Rape: An Overview of Roman Rape Laws from the Republican Period to Justinian's Reign |author=Nghiem L. Nguyen |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emperor [[Justinian]] continued the use of the statute to prosecute rape during the sixth century in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Justinian]] [http://www.constitution.org/sps/sps02_j1-4.htm ''Institutiones'']&lt;/ref&gt; By [[late antiquity]], the general term ''raptus'' had referred to abduction, [[elopement]], robbery, or rape in its modern meaning. Confusion over the term led ecclesiastical commentators on the law to differentiate it into ''raptus seductionis'' (elopement without parental consent) and ''raptus violentiae'' (ravishment). Both of these forms of ''raptus'' had a civil penalty and possible excommunication for the family and village receiving the abducted woman, although ''raptus violentiae'' also incurred punishments of mutilation or death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Basil of Caesarea]], [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf208.ix.cclxxi.html ''Letters''] circa 374 AD&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a husband could not be charged with raping his wife until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://time.com/3975175/spousal-rape-case-history/ |title=When Spousal Rape First Became a Crime in the U.S. |last=Rothman |first=Lily |website=Time|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, in some states in the US, a white woman having consensual sex with a black man was considered rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Challenge of Defining Rape |date=11 October 2014 |last=Urbina |first=Ian |publisher=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/sunday-review/being-clear-about-rape.html?_r=0|access-date= 5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1930s, rape was considered a [[sex crime]] that was always committed by men and always done to women. From 1935–1965, a shift from labeling rapists as criminals to believing them to be mentally ill "sexual [[psychopaths]]" began making its way into popular opinion. Men caught for committing rape were no longer sentenced to prison but admitted to mental health hospitals where they would be given medication for their illness.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997&gt;Maschke, Karen J. ''The Legal Response to Violence against Women''. New York: Garland Pub., 1997. {{ISBN|9780815325192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because only men deemed insane were the ones considered to have committed rape, no one considered the everyday person to be capable of such violence.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;

Transitions in women's roles in society were also shifting, causing alarm and blame towards rape victims. Because women were becoming more involved in the public (i.e. searching for jobs rather than being a housewife), some people claimed that these women were "loose" and looking for trouble. Giving up the [[gender role]]s of mother and wife was seen as defiant against traditional values while immersing themselves within society created the excuse that women would "not [be] entitled to protection under the traditional guidelines for male-female relationships".&lt;ref name=Maschke1997/&gt;

Until the 19th century, many jurisdictions required [[ejaculation]] for the act to constitute the offense of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=mdZktFIzfCgC}} |title=Development of Global Prohibition Regimes: Pillage and Rape in War - Tuba Inal |publisher= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=X_w83yCJCOQC}} |title=The Routledge History of Sex and the Body: 1500 to the Present |publisher= |date=2013-03-14 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts other than vaginal intercourse did not constitute rape in [[common law]] countries and in many other societies. In many cultures, such acts were illegal, even if they were consensual and performed between married couples (see [[sodomy laws]]). In England, for example, the [[Buggery Act 1533]], which remained in force until 1828, provided for the death penalty for "[[buggery]]". Many countries criminalized "non-traditional" forms of sexual activity well into the modern era: notably, in the US state of [[Idaho]], sodomy between consensual partners was punishable by a term of five years to life in prison as late as 2003, and this law was only ruled to be inapplicable to married couples in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glapn.org/sodomylaws/sensibilities/idaho.htm |last=Painter |first=George |title=The History of Sodomy Laws in the United States - Idaho |website=Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives of the Pacific Northwest |accessdate=2015-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, in many countries, the definition of the actus reus has been extended to all forms of penetration of the vagina and anus (e.g. penetration with objects, fingers or other body parts) as well as insertion of the penis in the mouth.

In the United States, before and during the [[American Civil War]] when [[chattel slavery]] was widespread, the law focused primarily on rape as it pertained to black men raping white women. The penalty for such a crime in many jurisdictions was death or castration. The rape of a black woman, by any man, was considered legal.&lt;ref name=Maschke1997 /&gt; As early as the 19th century, American women were criticized if they "stray[ed] out of a [dependent] position...fought off [an] attacker...[or] behaved in too self reliant a manner..." in which case "the term rape no longer applied".&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton Arnold, Marybeth.

The reaction formations belong to [[Defence_mechanisms#Level_3:_Neurotic|Level III]] of neurotic [[Defence mechanisms|defense mechanisms]], which also include intellectualization, dissociation, displacement and repression.

== Theory ==
Reaction formation depends on the hypothesis that

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[t]he instincts and their derivatives may be arranged as pairs of opposites: life versus death, construction versus destruction, action versus passivity, dominance versus submission, and so forth. When one of the instincts produces anxiety by exerting pressure on the ego either directly or by way of the superego, the ego may try to sidetrack the offending impulse by concentrating upon its opposite. For example, if feelings of hate towards another person make one anxious, the ego can facilitate the flow of love to conceal the hostility."&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"&gt;Calvin S. Hall, ''A Primer of Freudian Psychology'' (New York, 1954)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Where reaction-formation takes place, it is usually assumed that the original, rejected impulse does not vanish, but persists, unconscious, in its original infantile form.&lt;ref name="RycroftC-Psychoanalysis-Dictionary"/&gt; Thus, where love is experienced as a reaction formation against hate, we cannot say that love is substituted for hate, because the original aggressive feelings still exist underneath the affectionate exterior that merely ''masks'' the hate to hide it from awareness.&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;

In a diagnostic setting, the existence of a reaction-formation rather than a 'simple' emotion would be suspected where ''[[exaggeration]]'', ''compulsiveness'' and ''inflexibility'' were observed. For example,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[r]eactive love [[The lady doth protest too much, methinks|protests too much]]; it is overdone, extravagant, showy, and affected. It is counterfeit, and [...] is usually easily detected. Another feature of a reaction formation is its compulsiveness. A person who is defending himself against anxiety cannot deviate from expressing the opposite of what he really feels. His love, for instance, is not flexible. It cannot adapt itself to changing circumstances as genuine emotions do; rather it must be constantly on display as if any failure to exhibit it would cause the contrary feeling to come to the surface.&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Reaction formation is sometimes described as one of the most difficult defenses for lay people to understand;&lt;ref name="defenses-psychpage"/&gt; this testifies not merely to its effectiveness as a disguise, but also to its ubiquity and flexibility as a defense that can be utilized in many forms. For example, &lt;blockquote&gt;"solicitude may be a reaction-formation against cruelty, cleanliness against coprophilia",&lt;ref name="RycroftC-Psychoanalysis-Dictionary"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; and it is not unknown for an analyst to explain a client's unconditional pacifism as a reaction formation against their sadism. In addition, &lt;blockquote&gt;"[h]igh ideals of virtue and goodness may be reaction formations against primitive object [[cathexis|cathexes]] rather than realistic values that are capable of being lived up to. Romantic notions of chastity and purity may mask crude sexual desires, altruism may hide selfishness, and piety may conceal sinfulness."&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Even more counter-intuitively, according to this model
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[a] [[phobia]] is an example of a reaction formation. The person wants what he fears. He is not afraid of the object; he is afraid of the wish for the object. The reactive fear prevents the dreaded wish from being fulfilled.&lt;ref name="HallCS-Freudian-Primer"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The concept of reaction formation has been used to explain responses to external threats as well as internal anxieties. In the phenomenon described as [[Stockholm Syndrome]], a hostage or kidnap victim 'falls in love' with the feared and hated person who has complete power over them. Similarly paradoxical reports exist of powerless and vulnerable inmates of Nazi camps creating 'favourites' among the guards and even collecting objects discarded by them. The mechanism of reaction formation is often characteristic of obsessional neuroses. When this mechanism is overused, especially during the formation of the ego, it can become a permanent character trait. This is often seen in those with obsessional character and obsessive personality disorders. This does not imply that its periodic usage is always obsessional, but that it can lead to obsessional behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2708">'''Recklessness''' (also called '''unchariness''') is disregard for or indifference to the dangers of a situation or for the consequences of one's actions, as in deciding to act without stopping to think beforehand. [[Aristotle]] considered such rashness as one end (excessive) of a continuum, with [[courage]] as the mean, [[cowardice]] as the deficit [[vice]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Recklessness has been linked to [[antisocial personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;D, Coon/J. O. Mitterer, ''Introduction to Psychology'' (2008) p. 488&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

"Reck" is a regard or reckoning, particularly of a situation. A reckless individual would engage in an activity without concern for its after-effects. It can in certain cases be seen as heroic—for example, the soldier fearlessly charging into battle, with no care for his own safety, has a revered status among some. However, recklessness is more commonly regarded as a vice—this same soldier may be a liability to his own side, or get himself killed for no benefit – and may be the product of a [[Mortido|death wish]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''A Laynan's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis'' (1976) p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

The driving-force behind recklessness may be a need to test fate - an attempt to bolster a sense of [[omnipotence]] or of special privileges.&lt;ref&gt;J. Halliday/P. Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (1974) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Or it may be due to a loss of the feeling of anxiety,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Cleese|J. Cleese]]/[[Robin Skynner|R. Skynner]], ''[[Families and how to survive them]]'' (1994) p. 35-6&lt;/ref&gt; to a [[denial]] of it,&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 480&lt;/ref&gt; or to an attempt to [[Reaction formation|overcompensate]] for it.&lt;ref&gt;Erik H. Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1973) p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly dare-devils may overcompensate for an inhibited aggressiveness, while [[Narcissism|narcissists]] may enjoy a feeling that nothing can happen to them,&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 518 and p. 510&lt;/ref&gt; similar to what Aristotle termed the [[mania]]c.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bravery==

Recklessness should not be confused with bravery. Although the two could sometimes be connected, the latter is usually applied to cases where a person displays a more reasonable reckoning of the inherent danger, rather than none at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1949">The '''SAGA System''' is a [[role-playing game]] system that uses "fate cards" to determine the effects of actions. The cards have numbers, suits, positive and negative states, and role-playing cues that guide the [[gamemaster]] in telling the story and administering the game. The system has been used in [[TSR, Inc.]]'s ''[[Dragonlance: Fifth Age]]'' game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | author=Staff | journal=[[Shadis]]
 | title=Review: Dragonlance: The Fifth Age
 |date=May 1996 | issue=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''[[Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game]]'', later published by TSR. [[Sue Weinlein Cook|Sue Cook]] was the brand manager for both of those game systems, and helped design the SAGA game rules.&lt;ref name="Dragon #259"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kenson| first = Stephen| authorlink = Steve Kenson| title = Profiles: Sue Cook| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #259| page = 112| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| location = [[Renton, Washington]]|date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SAGA, a player holds a hand of fate cards that represent his health and the range of actions he can take. The maximum number of cards he can hold is determined by the number of quests he has completed. This replaces the [[experience points]] system of many other role-playing games. The cards replace dice-rolling, as well. When a player attempts an action, he plays a card from his hand. If the suit on the card matches the action type (swords for strength-related actions, for example) it is considered "Trump." Playing a trump card means that the player can draw another card from the top of the Fate Deck and add the number on it to his total for attempting the action. When a character takes damage, the player must discard the number of points of damage to be taken from his hand. When a player has no more cards in his hand, the character is unconscious.

In [[Buddhism]], the '''Sakadāgāmin''' ([[Pali]]; Sanskrit: ''Sakṛdāgāmin''), "returning once"&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 660, entry for "Sakadāgāmin" (retrieved 26 Sep 2007 at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1:2653.pali).&lt;/ref&gt; or "once-returner," is a partially [[bodhi|enlightened person]], who has cut off the first three [[Fetter (Buddhism)|chain]]s with which the ordinary mind is bound, and significantly weakened the fourth and fifth. Sakadagaminship is the second stage of the [[four stages of enlightenment]].

The Sakadagamin will be reborn into the realm of the senses at most once more. If, however, he attains the next stage of enlightenment ([[Anagami]]ship) in this life, he will not come back to this world.

The three specific chains or fetters (Pali: {{IAST|saṃyojana}}) of which the Sakadagamin is free are:&lt;br&gt;
1. {{IAST|Sakkāya-diṭṭhi}} (Pali) - Belief in self&lt;br&gt;
2. Sīlabbata-parāmāsa (Pali) - Attachment to rites and rituals&lt;br&gt;
3. Vicikicchā (Pali) - Skeptical doubt&lt;br&gt;The Sakadagami also significantly weakened the chains of:&lt;br&gt;
4. Kāma-rāga (Pali) - [[Raga (Buddhism)|Sensuous craving]]&lt;br&gt;
5. Byāpāda (Pali) - Ill-will

Thus, the Sakadagamin is an intermediate stage between the [[Sotapanna]], who still has comparatively strong sensuous desire and ill-will, and the [[Anagami]], who is completely free from sensuous desire and ill-will. A Sakadagami's mind is very pure. Thoughts connected with greed, hatred and delusion do not arise often, and when they do, do not become obsessive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5570">'''Sex Industry Network''' (also known as '''SIN''') is a peer-based, not for profit organisation, funded by SA Health, a [[South Australia]] government organisation. Its aim is to maintain low rates of [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), [[Blood-borne disease|blood borne viruses]] (BBVs) and [[HIV]] among [[sex workers]] and their clients in South Australia.

SIN provides safer sex supplies such as [[condoms]] and [[Personal lubricant|lube]] and delivers outreach to brothels, parlours, private and street based sex workers.

==History==
SIN was formed out of the Prostitutes Association of South Australia (PASA), a group formed in 1986 by sex workers.&lt;ref name="SIN Jennings"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jennings|first1=S.|title=Sex Industry Network – best practice sex worker organisation|url=http://pag.aids2014.org/Abstracts.aspx?AID=2116|website=pag.aids2014.prog|publisher=20th International AIDS Conference|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time community groups from priority populations (sex workers, men who have sex with men and injecting drug users) were being funded to deliver HIV prevention information and education within communities as part of Australia’s partnership approach to HIV/AIDS. In 1987, PASA received a grant from the SA Health Commission to conduct a three-month HIV/AIDS education project with sex workers called the ‘Travelling Parlour Show’. Several sex workers received training to become ‘peer educators’ and joined with a nurse from the [[sexually transmitted infection]]s clinic and took their education and information sessions to the workplaces of sex workers across the metropolitan area of [[Adelaide]].

In 1989, PASA and the AIDS council of South Australia (ACSA) joined forces to develop an ongoing HIV/AIDS education project with the sex workers of South Australia.&lt;ref name="Scarlet Alliance SIN"&gt;{{cite web|title=June 2010 "The House of Ill Repute – 21 Years of SIN" Adelaide|url=http://www.scarletalliance.org.au/media/News_Item.2010-05-21.4545 |website=scarletalliance.org.au|publisher=Scarlet Alliance|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project has had several name changes including ‘the PASA project’ and ‘SWIPE’ but has been known as the SA Sex Industry Network or SIN since 1994.&lt;ref name="Same Memory, SA State Library"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Industry Page 5|url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=670|website=samememory.sa.gov.au|publisher=Government of South Australia State Library|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SIN was a founding member and continues to be an active member of [[Scarlet Alliance]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Prostitution Hope Ditmore"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hope Ditmore|first1=Melissa|title=Encyclopedia of Prostitution and Sex Work, Volume 2|date=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=0313329702|page=431|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-5WyPfynlwMC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=Prostitutes+Association+of+South+Australia+%2B+PASA#v=onepage&amp;q=Prostitutes%20Association%20of%20South%20Australia%20%2B%20PASA&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ACSA became insolvent and SIN was temporarily closed.&lt;ref name="Star Observer Ozturk"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ozturk|first1=Serkan|title=SA Govt Forces Closure of AIDS Council|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/news/sa-govt-forces-closure-of-aids-council/107340|accessdate=12 October 2014|publisher=Star Observer|date=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scarlet Alliance supported a group of volunteer sex workers in South Australia to keep limited services going while new arrangements were negotiated with the funding bodies. The SA health department agreed to fund  Scarlet Alliance to complete ACSA’s original contract.&lt;ref name=SWOP&gt;{{cite web|title=Sex Worker Organisations|url=http://www.swop.org.au/links|website=swop.org.au|publisher=SWOP Sex Workers Outreach Project|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political advocacy==
SIN has supported Labor MP [[Steph Key]]'s attempts to decriminalize prostitution in South Australia. In 2012, the decriminalisation bill was defeated by one vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://au.news.yahoo.com/sa/a/24846631/selling-sex-in-the-city-adelaides-illegal-prostitution-industry/ Selling sex in the city: Adelaide's illegal prostitution industry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011002615/https://au.news.yahoo.com/sa/a/24846631/selling-sex-in-the-city-adelaides-illegal-prostitution-industry/ |date=2014-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2017, an improved bill which had support of sex workers, the working women's centre and unions was introduced into the upper house. The decriminalisation of sex work bill &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.legislation.sa.gov.au/LZ/B/CURRENT/STATUTES%20AMENDMENT%20(DECRIMINALISATION%20OF%20SEX%20WORK)%20BILL%202015_HON%20MICHELLE%20LENSINK%20MLC.aspx/ Decriminalisation of Sex Work Bill (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;  passed the upper house 13 votes to 8. .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-06/sa-sex-work-decriminalisation-marathon-debate/8682738/ Sex work decriminalisation one step closer in South Australia after marathon debate]&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2017, the lower house was set to debate the bill, however time ran out, resulting in a further delay to any progress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12070">'''Shadow banning''' (also called '''stealth banning''', '''ghost banning''' or '''comment ghosting'''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;) is the act of [[Block (Internet)|blocking]] or partially blocking  a user or their content from an [[online community]] such that it will not be readily apparent to the user that they have been banned.

By making a user's contributions invisible or less prominent to other members of the service, the hope may be that in the absence of reactions to their comments, the problematic or otherwise out-of-favour user will become bored or frustrated and leave the site.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-04/st_thompson|title=Clive Thompson on the Taming of Comment Trolls|last=Thompson|first=Clive|date=29 March 2009|accessdate=6 July 2014|newspaper=Wired magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh2006" /&gt;

== Notable examples ==
In the mid-1980s, BBS forums including [[Citadel (software)|''Citadel'' BBS software]] had a "twit bit" for problematic users.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3q744/where-did-shadow-banning-come-from-trump-republicans-shadowbanned |title=Where Did the Concept of 'Shadow Banning' Come From? |date=2018-07-31 |work=Motherboard |access-date=2018-08-01 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/suspension-ban-or-hellban.html |title=Suspension, Ban or Hellban? |last=Atwood |first=Jeff |publisher=Coding Horror blog |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When enabled, the user would have limited access, and commonly still be able to read public discussions; however, any messages posted by that "twit" would not be shown to the other users of that group.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citadel.org/doku.php/documentation:system_administration_manual |title=Manual installation of Citadel using source code and the command line client - Citadel.org |website=www.citadel.org |language=en |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Pryor of [[Fog Creek Software]] described stealth banning for online forums in 2006, saying how such a system was in place in the project management system [[FogBugz]], "to solve the problem of how do you get the person to go away and leave you alone". As well as preventing problem users from engaging in [[flame war]]s, the system also discouraged [[spammer]]s, who if they returned to the site would be under the false impression that their spam was still in place.&lt;ref name="Walsh2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Walsh|title=Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKuYXO-LKrcC|date=12 January 2006 |publisher=Apress |isbn=978-1-4302-0114-4 |page=183 |quote=So one of the things we did in FogBugz to solve the problem of how do you get the person to go away and leave you alone is, well, you take their post and make it invisible to everyone else, but they still see it. They won’t know they’ve been deleted. There’s no one fanning their flame. You can’t get into a flame war if no one responds to your criticism. So they get silenced and eventually just go away.

'''Tickle torture''' is the use of [[tickling]] to abuse, dominate, harass, humiliate, or interrogate an individual. While laughter is popularly thought of as a pleasure response, in tickle torture, the one being tickled may laugh despite whether or not they find the experience pleasant. In a tickling situation, laughter can indicate a panic reflex rather than a pleasure response. Tickle torture may be a consensual activity or one that is forced, depending on the circumstances.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/06/03/science/anatomy-of-a-tickle-is-serious-business-at-the-research-lab.html|publisher=New York Times|title=Anatomy of a Tickle Is Serious Business at the Research Lab|author=Carol Yoon|date=June 3, 1997|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a consensual form, tickle torture may be part of a mutually fulfilling, physically-intimate act between partners. However, forced tickle torture can cause real physical and mental distress in a victim, which is why it has been used as an interrogation method or to simply show dominance over another person.

==In history==
''Chinese tickle torture'' is an ancient form of torture practiced by the Chinese, in particular the courts of the [[Han Dynasty]]. Chinese tickle torture was a punishment for nobility since it left no marks and a victim could recover relatively easily and quickly.&lt;ref name=AZ&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TE2KfBWPAt0C&amp;pg=PA183|page=183|title=A to Z of Punishment and Torture|author=Irene Thompson|isbn=978-1-84624-203-8|publisher=Book Guild Publishing|date=March 2008|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of tickle torture was used in ancient [[Rome]], where a person’s feet were dipped in a salt solution, and a [[goat]] was brought in to lick the solution off. This type of tickle torture would only start as tickling, eventually becoming extremely painful.&lt;ref name=AZ/&gt;

{{Tone|section|date=March 2009}}

[[Josef Kohout]], a man persecuted in the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp]] during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], witnessed [[Nazi]] prison guards perform tickle torture on a fellow inmate, followed by various other tortures which resulted in his death. This incident is described in [[Heinz Heger]]'s book ''The Men With The Pink Triangle'': "The first game that the SS sergeant and his men played was to tickle their victim with goose feathers, on the soles of his feet, between his legs, in the [[armpit]]s, and on other parts of his naked body. At first the prisoner forced himself to keep silent, while his eyes twitched in fear and torment from one SS man to the other. Then he could not restrain himself and finally he broke out in a high-pitched laughter that very soon turned into a cry of pain."&lt;ref&gt;Heger, Heinz. ''The Men With the Pink Triangle''. Boston: Alyson Publications, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' about European tortures describes a method of tickle torture in which a [[goat]] was compelled to lick the victim's feet because they had been dipped in salt water. Once the goat had licked the salt off, the victim's feet would be dipped in the salt water again and the process would repeat itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamey | first1 = Gavin | year = 2001 | title = Torture: European Instruments of Torture and Capital Punishment from the Middle Ages to Present | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 323 | issue = 7308| page = 346 | doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7308.346}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Japan]], those in positions of authority could administer punishments to those convicted of crimes that were beyond the criminal code. This was called shikei, which translates as ‘private punishment.’ One such torture was kusuguri-zeme: "merciless tickling."&lt;ref&gt;Schreiber, Mark.''  The Dark Side: Infamous Japanese Crimes and Criminals''. Japan: Kodansha International, 2001. Page 71&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Sibling Abuse]]'', Vernon Wiehe published his research findings regarding 150 adults who were abused by their siblings during childhood. Several reported tickling as a type of physical abuse they experienced, and based on these reports it was revealed that abusive tickling is capable of provoking extreme physiological reactions in the victim, such as [[vomiting]], incontinence (losing control of bladder), and [[Unconsciousness|losing consciousness]] due to inability to breathe.&lt;ref&gt;Wiehe, Vernon. Sibling Abuse: Hidden Physical, Emotional, and Sexual Trauma. New York: Lexington Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a small number of documented instances of tickle torture in the ''[[New York Times]]''. They happened in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and in these instances restrained victims were tickled upon the bare soles of their feet, apparently against their will and for the pleasure of their tormentors.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

There is currently no evidence that tickle torture was ever widespread or was practiced by governments. The very small amount of related documentation discovered thus far originates from [[England]] and the [[United States]].

A 1903 article described an immobilized [[Suicide|suicidal]] patient at the [[Hudson River State Hospital]] who was tied to a bed for his own safety. While he lay helpless, the patient's toes were tickled by one of the hospital attendants, Frank A. Sanders. "Sanders is said to have confessed that while intoxicated he amused himself by tickling the feet and ribs of Hayes and pulling his nose." Sanders also gave his restrained victim a black eye. Another hospital employee came upon Sanders while he was entertaining himself at his patient's expense, and the criminal was brought before a grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Treated Patient Brutally |work=New York Times |date=September 6, 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1887 article entitled "England in Old Times" states "Gone, too, are the parish stocks, in which offenders against public morality formerly sat imprisoned, with their legs held fast beneath a heavy wooden [[yoke]], while sundry small but fiendish boys improved the occasion by deliberately pulling off their shoes and tickling the soles of their defenseless feet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Ker |title=England in Old Times |work=New York Times |date=November 13, 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1872, the beating of a man's bare feet was described in an article entitled "Terrible Punishments: The Russian [[Knout]] and Turkish [[Bastinado]]: How the Punishments are Inflicted". The author, while explaining the intense pain caused by whipping, writes "I have heard men cry out in agony...but I never heard such heart-rending sounds as those from the poor bastinadoed wretch before me. Such is the bastinado. And of the intensiveness of the agony which its infliction produces, one has only to think of the congeries or plexus of delicate nerves which have their terminus in the feet. Even tickling the soles of the feet has often produced death; what then must be the excruciating pain when cruel violence is done to those most sensitive members?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=L.G.C. |title=Terrible Punishments: The Russian Knout and Turkish [[Bastinado]]: How the Punishments are Inflicted |work=New York Times |date=April 14, 1872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses and meanings==
The term ''tickle torture'' can apply to many different situations that do not include the aforementioned acts of either sexual gratification or malicious torture.

''Tickle torture'' can be an extended act of tickling where the recipient of the tickling would view it as a long time or tickling of an intense nature. This can be due to the length of time they are tickled, the intensity of the tickling or the areas that are being tickled. This can simply be a 30-second tickle applied to the victim's bare feet, which can seem like a much longer time if the victim's feet are very ticklish. While the palm of the [[hand]] is far more sensitive to touch, other commonly ticklish areas include the [[armpits]], sides of the [[torso]], [[neck]], [[knee]], [[midriff]], [[thigh]]s, [[navel]], and the [[ribs]]. Many people consider the [[sole (foot)|sole]]s of their feet the most ticklish, due to the many nerve endings located there: this explains why tickling one's feet against their will is the most common example of "tickle torture".&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harris, Christine R.|title=The mystery of ticklish laughter|journal=American Scientist|year=1999|accessdate=2008-11-09|volume=87|page=344|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/1999/4/the-mystery-of-ticklish-laughter|doi=10.1511/1999.4.344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Tickle torture" may also have other uses, including the act of tickling a person as a practical joke, or even an interrogation method. This may not be extreme tickling, but could include prolonged tickling upon a sensitive area until the victim has released the required information. In the former case, it could be used as a way of "pranking" a person, as the act of being tickled can produce many sounds and sensations that could be viewed as being embarrassing to the victim. In this way, the tickling can continue to the point where a certain reaction is revealed.

This method of "pranking" could also incorporate the use of physical restraint or restraint using materials. This would be done to leave a desired area of the body bare and vulnerable to the tickling, in a way that the victim would not be able to remove this area from the tickling, and would have to simply endure. This can also be seen as "punishment" or "payback" as the tickler could be using the tickling as retribution from a previous tickling experience or "prank".

{{Main|Tickling fetishism}}
In [[sexual fetishism]], tickle torture is an activity between consenting partners. A torture session usually begins with one partner allowing the other to tie them up in a position that exposes bare parts of the body, particularly those that are sensitive to tickling. Though many parts of the human body are deemed ticklish, tickle torture is commonly associated with the tickling of the bare feet or armpits.

The bondage methods of the tickling usually follows the same basic methods. The object of the bondage is to render the victim unable to remove themselves from the tickling, as well as rendering the ticklish areas of the victim vulnerable. The victim is usually bound in a sitting or lying position rather than a standing one as to expose the soles of the feet which are often among the areas upon which tickling is inflicted. The restraint of the arms above the head leaves the upper body and underarms susceptible to the tickling. This enables the torturer to use whatever they want, e.g. fingers, tongue, beard, feathers, brush, pine cones, salt sticks, electric toothbrush or a vacuum cleaner.

==In fiction==
In [[VeggieTales]]'s ''[[Esther... The Girl Who Became Queen]]'', King Xerxes disposes of criminals by banishing them to the Island of Perpetual Tickling, to which [[Death (personification)|Death]], wielding a scythe-sized feather, escorts them.  Thus, tickle torture serves here as a [[family-friendly]] depiction of capital punishment.

The TV series ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' had a recurring character named Don Turtelli whose main form of torture was to take a feather to the soles of the feet of his captives.

Tickle torture has become the subject of many fetish/sexual publications. These fictional writings can portray a fantasy of a desirable character, often a  celebrity, being restrained and interrogated. These stories are not always sexual, although they are mostly the object of sexual fantasies and dreams. Because of the fantasy element of the plot, the characters are often magical or the circumstances are completely imaginative.

In one of the light novels of the ''[[List of Naruto print media#Naruto_Secret_Chronicles_series|Naruto Secret Chronicle]]'' series, the shinobi Sai uses tickle torture on an ANBU member he was interrogating, as the man had been taught to withstand traditional torture. The action succeeded in them finding the location of their comrade, [[Sakura Haruno]].

'''Transmodernity''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] concept used by the Spanish philosopher and feminist [[Rosa María Rodríguez Magda]] in her 1989 essay ''La sonrisa de Saturno: Hacia una teoría transmoderna''. Her approach, based on [[Hegel]]ian logic, views [[modernity]], [[postmodernity]], and transmodernity as a [[dialectic]] triad in which transmodernity is critical of both [[modernism]] and [[postmodernism]], but incorporates elements of both.&lt;ref&gt;Tribe, John (2009). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3XAHXFpPYSIC&amp;pg=PA283 ''Philosophical Issues in Tourism''], p. 283. Channel View Publications. {{ISBN|1845412494}},&lt;/ref&gt;
Transmodernism, as first identified in the philosophical work of Rodriguez (2004), is an umbrella term that connotes the emerging socio-cultural, economic, political and philosophical shift way beyond postmodernity (Ateljevic, 2013:200) which is much more wide, deep and radical than what dominant economists and politicians call globalization (Ghisi, 2010)&lt;ref&gt;Ateljevic, I.

Other interpretations on this term have been elaborated in conjunction with the cultural movement of [[transmodernism]] founded by Argentinian-Mexican philosopher [[Enrique Dussel]]. The concept of transmodernity has also been used to re-work the notion of postmodernity, highlighting its structural relation to globalization and informatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mura |first=Andrea |year=2012 |title=The Symbolic Function of Transmodernity |journal=Language and Psychoanalysis |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=68–87 |url=https://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008211951/http://www.language-and-psychoanalysis.com/Mura%202012.pdf |archivedate=2015-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

WAN currently runs the [http://www.walkingartistsnetwork.org/step-by-step-seminar-series/ Step by Step] seminar series at the University of East London, bringing together artists and academics to discuss ideas around walking, and maintains an active email discussion community through [[JISCMail|JISCmail]].

In 2014 the Walking Artists Network collaborated with Airspace Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent, to produce [http://www.airspacegallery.org/index.php/projects/the_walking_encyclopaedia_incl._paths_of_variable_resistance The Walking Encyclopaedia] (2014) a gallery exhibition and online archive of walking practices that includes more than 150 walking practitioners and artworks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9404">A '''wallflower''' is someone with an [[Introversion|introverted]] personality type (or in more extreme cases, [[social anxiety]]) who will attend parties and social gatherings, but will usually distance themselves from the crowd and actively avoid being in the limelight.

The name itself derives from [[Wallflower|eponymous plant]]'s unusual growth pattern; against a wall as a stake or in cracks and gaps in stone walls. "Wallflowers" might literally stand against a wall and simply observe others at a social gathering, rather than mingle. This could be due to [[anxiety]], [[shyness]], lack of [[social skills]] or [[inferiority complex|self-esteem]].

Wallflower can also be used on a grander scale. When a company or organization chooses or is forced to remain on the sidelines of any activity, they can be referred to as a "wallflower".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/wallflower|title=the definition of wallflower|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Connection to Sociology ==

=== Structural function theory ===

[[Structural functionalism]] is a sociological theory that sees society as a number of complex parts that form a stable and functional whole. This leads to a strong and coherent family unit made of smaller parts, with the functioning family unit then going on to form the smaller parts of a wider community, society and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reference.com/world-view/example-structural-functionalism-83dd92e670a96efc#|title=What is an example of structural functionalism?|newspaper=Reference|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social conflict theory ===

[[Social conflict]] theory in [[sociology]] claims that society is in a state of perpetual conflict due to competition for limited resources. It holds that social order is maintained by domination and power, rather than consensus and conformity. According to conflict theory, those with wealth and power try to hold on to it by any means possible, chiefly by suppressing the poor and powerless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/conflict-theory.asp|title=Conflict Theory|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2013-07-10|newspaper=Investopedia|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbolic interaction theory ===
The most relevant sociological theory that the "wallflower" relates to, [[Symbolic interactionism|Symbolic Interaction]] describes specific gestures or [[Norm (social)|social norms]] that are symbolic in meaning. The theory consists of three core principles: meaning, language and thought. These core principles lead to conclusions about the creation of a person’s self and socialization into a larger community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.utwente.nl/cw/theorieenoverzicht/Theory%20Clusters/Interpersonal%20Communication%20and%20Relations/Symbolic_Interactionism/|title=Symbolic Interactionism|website=www.utwente.nl|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the "wallflower" will usually exhibit a ''lack of'' interaction with others, it becomes symbolic of their thoughts and feelings towards others. The most specific example would be in the [[body language]]. Many times people who are shy have little or no eye contact with others. You may see a man, woman, or child try to avoid eye contact with others while out walking around in public or even in private. For some this may be a condition that becomes consistent over time and become a normal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://readingbodylanguagenow.com/shyness/|title=Body language of shyness – Body language expert, reading body language, read body language of men and women|website=readingbodylanguagenow.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of parties or social gatherings, the "wallflower" will remain at a certain distance from the crowd or most of the people. When a shy person is around others you may see that they do what they can to stay away from the people that they do not know. Even with some friends you may or may not see the shy man or woman even near or in the Bell Bubble or within the intimate distance of friends. In a social setting you may not see a shy person in the center of the room without a friend or group of friends. Shy people tend to stay out of the possibility of even being the center of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://readingbodylanguagenow.com/shyness/|title=Body language of shyness – Body language expert, reading body language, read body language of men and women|website=readingbodylanguagenow.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social anxiety ===
[[Social anxiety disorder|Social anxiety]] the extreme fear of being scrutinized and judged by others in social or performance situations: Social anxiety disorder can wreak havoc on the lives of those who suffer from it. This disorder is ''not'' simply shyness that has been inappropriately medicated. Symptoms may be so extreme that they disrupt daily life. People with this disorder, also called ''[[Social Phobia|social phobia]]'', may have few or no social or romantic relationships, making them feel powerless, alone, or even ashamed.

Although they recognize that the fear is excessive and unreasonable, people with social anxiety disorder feel powerless against their anxiety. They are terrified they will humiliate or embarrass themselves.The anxiety can interfere significantly with daily routines, occupational performance, or social life, making it difficult to complete school, interview and get a job, and have friendships and romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/social-anxiety-disorder|title=Social Anxiety Disorder {{!}} Anxiety and Depression Association of America, ADAA|website=www.adaa.org|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a wallflower can be considered a less-intense form of social anxiety. A person with social anxiety may feel a sense of hesitation in large crowds, and may even have a sense of panic if forced to become the center of attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthcentral.com/anxiety/c/22705/98818/fear-crowds/|title=Fear of Crowds - Phobias - Anxiety|website=www.healthcentral.com|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fear may cause them to do something as minor as stand away from the center of a party, but it may also cause a major or minor anxiety attack.

People with social anxiety disorder do not believe that their anxiety is related to a medical or physical illness or disease. This type of anxiety occurs in most social situations, especially when the person feels on display or is the center of attention. Once a person avoids almost all social and public interactions we say the person has an extreme case of social anxiety disorder, more commonly called [[Avoidant personality disorder|Avoidant Personality Disorder]].  As you would expect, people with social anxiety disorder have an elevated rate of relationship difficulties and [[substance abuse]].

=== Panic and anxiety attacks ===
[[Panic attack|Anxiety attacks]] are a combination of physical and mental symptoms that are intense and overwhelming. The anxiety is, however, more than just regular nervousness. Symptoms of anxiety attacks and panic attacks mimic serious medical issues, such as:

* [[Myocardial infarction|Heart attacks]] and [[heart failure]].
* [[Brain tumor]]s.
* [[Multiple sclerosis]].
Despite their intensity, anxiety attacks are generally not life-threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/attacks/symptoms-and-signs|title=Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Attacks|website=www.calmclinic.com|access-date=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Renewable energy sources}}
A '''wave farm''' – or '''wave power farm''' or '''wave energy park''' – is a collection of machines in the same location and used for the [[generation]] of [[wave power]] [[electricity]]. Wave farms can be either offshore or nearshore, with the former the most promising for the production of large quantities of electricity for the grid. The first wave farm was constructed in Portugal, the Aguçadoura Wave Farm, consisting of three Pelamis machines. The world's largest is planned for Scotland.

==United Kingdom==

===Scotland===
Funding for a wave farm in [[Scotland]] was announced on February 20, 2007 by the [[Scottish Executive]], at a cost of over [[pound sterling|£]]4 million, as part of a £13 million funding packages for [[Renewable energy in Scotland#Wave power|marine power in Scotland]]. The farm will be the world's largest with a capacity of 3MW generated by four Pelamis machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/6377423.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Orkney to get 'biggest' wave farm | date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Renewable energy in Scotland]].

[[Ocean Power Technologies]] (OPT), based in [[Pennington, New Jersey]] is involved in the development of a wave farm off '''[[Cromarty Firth]]'''.  The PB150 [[PowerBuoy]] was successfully deployed at sea in 2011 by a team including Scotland-based Global Maritime Scotland Ltd, Port Services (Invergordon) Ltd and OPT, with the support of the Cromarty Firth Port Authority.

The £10 million Saltire prize challenge will be awarded to the first to be able to generate 100 GWh from wave power over a continuous two-year period by 2017 (about 5.7 MW average).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/28/orkney-green-energy-wave-power Orkney, leader in green energy, launches wave power competition]&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
Funding for a wave farm known as [[Wave hub]] off the north coast of [[Cornwall]], [[England]] was approved in June 2007. The [[Wave hub]] operates as an extension cable allowing developers to install and operate wave energy generating devices while keeping down connection costs. Four device operators have expressed an interest in using the site which will initially allow up to 20MW of wave energy capacity.

[[Ocean Power Technologies]] (OPT), based in [[Pennington, New Jersey]] is involved in [[Wave Hub]]. Located in [[Cornwall, England]], OPT aims to develop its [[PowerBuoy]] technology, an innovative renewable energy project, and expects to create the UK's first offshore facility for the demonstration and proving of arrays of [[wave energy]] generation devices.

A 2017 study estimates that commercial wave farms are not close to being feasible.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/uk-wave-energy-startups-have-failed-on-their-promises&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://strathcloud.sharefile.eu/app?/#/share/view/sfa07a0e490740cea&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
[[Wave power in the United States]] is under development in several locations off the east &amp; west coasts as well as Hawaii. It has moved beyond the research phase and major installations are planned to come on-line within the next few years. Its use to-date has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such, the power output is currently modest.

According to the president of trade association Ocean Renewable Energy Coalition, “The total potential off the coast of the United States is 252 million megawatt hours a year.”&lt;ref&gt;Wave Farms Show Energy Potential
   By Jason Margolis http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6410839.stm
&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the absence of current implementation of major projects, there has been significant investment on the part of public utility companies and federal funds for the implementation and economic viability of two new wave power energy centers as of September 30, 2008.

On December 18, 2007 the [[Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company]], the largest national utility company, announced a commercial agreement to purchase power generated by wave energy. This decision was made in part to be competitive in the public electrical energy market in the state of California under stringent [[renewable energy]] restrictions. Currently, California state law requires that publicly owned utilities are required to generate 20% of their electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and wave power by 2010. After the General Election on November 4, 2008 this law may be subject to change to an even more stringent law, which states that publicly owned utilities would be required to increase their proportion of electricity from renewable resources to 20% by 2010, 40% by 2020 and 50% by 2025.&lt;ref&gt;Proposition 7 Renewable Energy Generation State of California http://www.smartvoter.org/2008/11/04/ca/state/prop/7/&lt;/ref&gt;

Federally, under the Marine Renewable Energy Research and Development Act of 2007 the United States has committed $200 million in federal funds toward wave energy technology to be allocated from 2008 through 2012. The [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) is currently responsible for the allocation of $50 million per fiscal year for research, development, demonstration and commercial application of ocean energy.&lt;ref&gt;Wave Energy Bill Approved by U.S. House Science Committee http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2007/06/wave-energy-bill-approved-by-u-s-house-science-committee-48984.html
June 18, 2007
&lt;/ref&gt;   In 2008, the first year of federal allocation toward wave energy, there are a total of fourteen recipients. The most notable recipients of this year include Oregon State University and the University of Hawaii. Oregon State University in partnership with the University of Washington, will implement the development of the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center for wave and tidal energy. The second recipient, University of Hawaii will develop and implement the National Renewable Marine Energy Center in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;DOE announces first marine renewable energy grants

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Grays Harbor Ocean Energy Company]] of Seattle has applied to the [[Federal Energy Regulatory Commission]] for permits to harness energy from waves off the coastline of California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. The $28 billion project would be the largest renewable energy project in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28113042/|title=$28 billion in wave energy projects proposed|date=Dec 8, 2008|publisher=The Associated Press|accessdate=2008-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Ocean Power Technologies]] (O.P.T.), based in [[Pennington, New Jersey]] is involved in the following wave projects in the US:
* '''LEAP Autonomous [[PowerBuoy]], New Jersey''' - O.P.T. has successfully operated an autonomous PowerBuoy® off New Jersey, designed and manufactured by O.P.T. under the US Navy’s Littoral Expeditionary Autonomous PowerBuoy (LEAP) program for coastal security and maritime surveillance.
* '''Coos Bay, Oregon''' - O.P.T. is proposing to develop a utility-scale, commercial wave park in North America at [[Coos Bay, Oregon]]. The planned size of this park is up to 100 megawatts, and it will be the largest wave energy project in the world when it is completed
* '''Reedsport, Oregon''' - O.P.T. is developing a commercial wave park on the west coast of the United States located 2.5 miles offshore near [[Reedsport, Oregon]]. The first phase of this project is for ten PB150 [[PowerBuoy]]s, or 1.5 megawatts.&lt;ref name="Reeds03102012"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidferris/2012/10/03/in-wave-energy-oregon-races-to-catch-up-to-europe/?ss=business:energy] US catching up with Europe - Forbes October 3, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The Reedsport wave farm is now scheduled for installation spring 2013.&lt;ref name="Reeds04102012"&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2012/10/setback_arises_for_wave-power.html] Reedsport project delayed due to early onset of winter weather - OregonLive Oct 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oahu, Hawaii''' - From 2009 to 2011, O.P.T. ocean-tested its PowerBuoy at the US Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) at Kaneohe Bay. The [[Oahu]] [[PowerBuoy]] was launched under the Company's program with the US Navy for ocean testing and demonstration of PowerBuoys, including connection to the Oahu grid.
* '''Atlantic City, New Jersey''' - The prototype project, wherein the principles demonstrated with the PB40 prototype [[PowerBuoy]] deployed and tested off the coast of Atlantic City were integrated into the designs of the buoys for Hawaii, Spain, and PB150 PowerBuoys.

==Spain==
The [[Mutriku Breakwater Wave Plant]] is the world´s first breakwater wave plant with a multiple turbine arrangement. It is located in the Mutriku´s dike and has been producing electrical energy since July 2011. The plant has a capacity of 296&amp;nbsp;kW from 16 turbines and 16 OWCs.&lt;ref name="mutriku"&gt;http://www.eve.eus/EVE/media/EVE/pdf/Mutriku-2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the winter 2015, the plant supplied its first GWh to the grid. This up-and-running power plant is available as a test site where different researchers can test their WOC based generators.

==Portugal==

==Italy==
The company 40South Energy has its offshore test site in Castiglioncello, Italy, and plans to upgrade the site to a commercial Wave Energy Park by connecting it with an electrical cable to shore. In the meantime, the owners of an offshore aquaculture installation in Lavagna, Italy, are in the process of converting their concession from fish farming to fish farming plus electricity production. The technology used in this Wave Energy Park will come from 40South Energy.

==Russia==
In 2013, [[Ocean RusEnergy]] company, based in [[Yekaterinburg]], demonstrated a line of wave energy generators, ranging from 160W to 1MW(planned). Their modular design allows to assemble a wave power farm having a desired capacity. Unlike other wave power projects it targets small-scale and private electricity generation.&lt;ref name="offshore1"&gt;[http://www.offshorewind.biz/2013/04/22/russian-company-develops-mobile-wave-energy-generator/ Russian Company Develops Mobile Wave Energy Generator] offshorewind.biz&lt;/ref&gt;

The Winterbourne View hospital inquiry occurred at Winterbourne View, a private hospital at [[Hambrook]], [[South Gloucestershire]], England, owned and operated by Castlebeck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companiesintheuk.co.uk/ltd/caring-homes-healthcare-group |title=GA HC REIT II CH U.K. SENIOR HOUSING PORTFOLIO LIMITED, SW1H 0AD 21 PALMER STREET Financial Information |website=Companiesintheuk.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] investigation broadcast on television in 2011, exposed the [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[psychological abuse]] suffered by people with [[learning disabilities]] and [[challenging behaviour]] at the care home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=21:00 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011pwt6 |title=BBC One - Panorama, Undercover Care: The Abuse Exposed |website=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}

Local social services and the English national regulator ([[Care Quality Commission]]) had received various warnings but the mistreatment continued. One senior nurse, Terry Bryan, reported his concerns to the management at Winterbourne View and to CQC, but his complaint was not taken up.&lt;ref name="systematic"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-14181646 |title=Winterbourne View 'failed to protect people' - BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public funded hospital has been shut down as a result of the abuse that took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-13891855 |title=Winterbourne View 'abuse' hospital closes on Friday - BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abuse==
The undercover footage showed staff repeatedly assaulting and harshly restraining patients under chairs. Staff gave one patients cold punishment showers, left her outside in near zero temperatures, and later poured mouthwash into her eyes. They pulled patients' hair and forced medication into patients' mouths. Victims were shown screaming and shaking, and one patient was seen trying to jump out of a second floor window to escape the torment, and was then mocked by staff members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-20084254 | title=Winterbourne View: Abuse footage shocked nation | publisher=BBC | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One patient was repeatedly [[Eye poke|poked in the eyes]].&lt;ref name="reporter"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/panorama/hi/front_page/newsid_9501000/9501531.stm | title=Undercover reporter 'haunted' by abuse of patients | publisher=BBC | accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A clinical psychologist who reviewed the footage described the abuse as "torture".&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13548222 | title=Four arrests after patient abuse caught on film | publisher=BBC | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
On 21 June 2011, 86 people and organisations wrote to the Prime Minister, [[David Cameron]] about the revelations, "We are aware of the various actions currently being taken within and outside government – such as the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|DH]] review and CQC internal inquiry. We hope to make submissions to those both individually and collectively. However, on their own these will not be enough and a clear programme is needed to achieve change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ann McCallum |url=http://www.dimensions-uk.org/news-and-events/response-to-winterbourne-view-interim-report/ |title=Experts available for comment - Dimensions |website=Dimensions-uk.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prime minister responded saying he was “appalled” at the “catalogue of abuses” Panorama uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndti.org.uk/news/archive-news/news-stories-from-2011/prime-minister-responds-to-letter-demanding-action-after-winterbourne-view/ |title=Prime Minister Responds to Letter Demanding Action After Winterbourne View &amp;#124; NDTi |website=Ndti.org.uk |date=2015-03-12 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011 the Association of Supported Living issued a press statement, which was followed up in writing to every member of parliament in the United Kingdom, calling for community based supported living services to replace institutional services for people with learning disabilities.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' said "Without the investigation by the [[Panorama (TV series)|BBC's Panorama]], given huge coverage in the Mail, the abuse of patients at Winterbourne View might be continuing to this day. As it is, the secure hospital and two other care homes have been shut down, 11 guilty staff have been brought to justice – and a devastating report now exposes the serial failings of the local NHS, police and health watchdogs. For the past year, the [[Leveson Inquiry]] has focused relentlessly on the failings of the media. Never let it be forgotten how much this country owes, in the fight against cruelty and corruption, to its free Press."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mail Leader|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2185152/How-bring-integrity-City.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' said, "It is impossible to read the details of what went on at Winterbourne View, a care home for the severely disabled in Gloucestershire, without feeling repelled. In the wake of an exposé from the BBC's Panorama, 11 members of staff were convicted of almost 40 charges of neglect and ill treatment of those in their care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Telegraph Leader|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9459049/Reform-the-regulators.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Institute of Learning Disabilities Summary|url=http://www.bild.org.uk/news-and-whats-on/winterbourne-view/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningdisabilitycoalition.org.uk/ |title=Learning Disability Coalition |publisher=Learning Disability Coalition |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systemic failings==
The national regulator, the CQC did a nationwide check on facilities owned by the same company, Castlebeck Care  – as a result three more institutions have been closed. The CQC reported a "systemic failure to protect people or to investigate allegations of abuse" and said that Castlebeck Care had "misled" the health watchdog.&lt;ref name="systematic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111027090534/http://www.cqc.org.uk:80/media/regulator-announces-third-castlebeck-service-close ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The CQC also came under criticism for failing to respond to early warnings of abuse at the care home. It initially blamed Winterbourne managers who, the CQC said, "effectively misled us by not keeping us informed about incidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/content/cqc-report-winterbourne-view-confirms-its-owners-failed-protect-people-abuse |title=CQC report on Winterbourne View confirms its owners failed to protect people from abuse &amp;#124; Care Quality Commission |website=Cqc.org.uk |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it later emerged that managers had officially alerted the CQC to numerous allegations of staff abusing patients, dating back to February 2008, which were also reported to the police, but did not lead to any convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosted.southglos.gov.uk/wv/report.pdf |format=PDF |title=South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board |website=Hosted.southglos.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
The CQC also inspected 132 similar institutions and a [[Serious Case Review]] was commissioned – some of the roughly ten local and national enquiries were carried out to examine what went wrong, including one by NHS Southwest which was one of the first to be published and list many of the others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121127132959/http://www.southofengland.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Final-Report-for-publication-Report-of-the-NHS-Review-of-Commissioning-of-Care-and-Treatment-at-Winterbourne-View-30-July-2012.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Other Home Closed|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-15092330 | work=BBC News | date=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The head of the Care Quality Commission resigned ahead of a critical government report, a report in which Winterbourne View was cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cynthia Bower Resigns|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/feb/23/nhs-watchdog-cynthia-bower-resigns | location=London | newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|first=Denis|last=Campbell|date=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mencap]] published a report warning that similar abuse could be going on elsewhere and calling for the closure of all large institutions far from people's families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mencap Report|url=http://www.mencap.org.uk/outofsight|website=Mencap.org.uk|accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convictions==
Eleven people pleaded guilty to criminal offences of [[neglect]] or [[abuse]] as a result of evidence from Undercover Care and six of them were jailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleventh Guilty Plea|url=http://www.avonandsomerset.police.uk/LocalPages/NewsDetails.aspx?nsid=25947&amp;t=1&amp;lid=2|website=Thisisbristol.co.uk|accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-20092894 | title=Winterbourne View: Care workers jailed for abuse | publisher=BBC | accessdate=30 October 2012 | date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after the eleventh person pleaded guilty, the Serious Case Review was published, revealing hundreds of previous incidents at the hospital and missed warnings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120810012622/http://www.southglos.gov.uk:80/NR/exeres/DDE51D39-E8AC-4343-8DDA-7F08B03CBA10 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Serious Case Review|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Report-Winterbourne-View-identifies-sustained/story-16661739-detail/story.html|website=Thisisbritstol.co.uk|accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29699">'''Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks''' (ZIFs) are a class of [[metal-organic framework]]s that are topologically isomorphic with [[zeolite]]s. ZIFs are composed of [[tetrahedron|tetrahedrally-coordinated]] [[transition metal]] ions (e.g. [[iron|Fe]], [[cobalt|Co]], [[copper|Cu]], [[zinc|Zn]]) connected by [[imidazolate]] linkers. Since the metal-imidazole-metal angle is similar to the 145° Si-O-Si angle in zeolites, ZIFs have zeolite-like topologies.&lt;ref name="park"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Park|first=KS|title=Exceptional chemical and thermal stability of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks|journal=PNAS|year=2006|pages=10186–10191|doi=10.1073/pnas.0602439103|url=http://yaghi.chem.ucla.edu/pdfPublications/Park_Yaghi.pdf|volume=103|issue=27|bibcode = 2006PNAS..10310186P |display-authors=etal|pmc=1502432}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, 105 ZIF topologies have been reported in the literature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Phan, A.; Doonan, C.

== Synthesis ==

ZIFs are prepared by [[Solvothermal synthesis|solvothermal]] or [[Hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal]] techniques. Crystals slowly grow from a heated solution of a hydrated metal salt, an ImH ([[imidazole]] with acidic proton), a solvent, and base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Kyo Sung|last2=Ni|first2=Zheng|last3=Côté|first3=Adrien P.|last4=Choi|first4=Jae Yong|last5=Huang|first5=Rudan|last6=Uribe-Romo|first6=Fernando J.|last7=Chae|first7=Hee K.|last8=O’Keeffe|first8=Michael|last9=Yaghi|first9=Omar M.|display-authors=3|date=2006-07-05|title=Exceptional chemical and thermal stability of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/103/27/10186|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=103|issue=27|pages=10186–10191|doi=10.1073/pnas.0602439103|issn=0027-8424|pmc=1502432|pmid=16798880|bibcode=2006PNAS..10310186P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Functionalized ImH linkers allow for control of ZIF structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayashi|first=Hideki|last2=Côté|first2=Adrien P.|last3=Furukawa|first3=Hiroyasu|last4=O’Keeffe|first4=Michael|last5=Yaghi|first5=Omar M.|display-authors=3|date=2007-07-01|title=Zeolite A imidazolate frameworks|url=http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v6/n7/full/nmat1927.html|journal=Nature Materials|language=en|volume=6|issue=7|pages=501–506|doi=10.1038/nmat1927|issn=1476-1122|bibcode=2007NatMa...6..501H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is ideal for generating monocrystalline materials for [[X-ray crystallography|single-crystal X-ray diffraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Rahul|last2=Phan|first2=Anh|last3=Wang|first3=Bo|last4=Knobler|first4=Carolyn|last5=Furukawa|first5=Hiroyasu|last6=O'Keeffe|first6=Michael|last7=Yaghi|first7=Omar M.|display-authors=3|date=2008-02-15|title=High-Throughput Synthesis of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks and Application to CO2 Capture|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/319/5865/939|journal=Science|language=en|volume=319|issue=5865|pages=939–943|doi=10.1126/science.1152516|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18276887|bibcode=2008Sci...319..939B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Bo|last2=Côté|first2=Adrien P.|last3=Furukawa|first3=Hiroyasu|last4=O’Keeffe|first4=Michael|last5=Yaghi|first5=Omar M.|display-authors=3|date=2008-05-08|title=Colossal cages in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks as selective carbon dioxide reservoirs|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v453/n7192/full/nature06900.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=453|issue=7192|pages=207–211|doi=10.1038/nature06900|issn=0028-0836|bibcode=2008Natur.453..207W}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of solvents, bases, and conditions have been explored, with an eye towards improving crystal functionality, morphology, and dispersity. Prototypically, an amide solvent such as [[Dimethylformamide|N,N-dimethylformamide]] (DMF) is used.

==Applications of ZIFs==

=== Applications to carbon capture ===

ZIF’s exhibit some properties relevant to carbon capture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Venna|first=Surendar R.|last2=Carreon|first2=Moises A.|date=2010-01-13|title=Highly Permeable Zeolite Imidazolate Framework-8 Membranes for CO2/CH4 Separation|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja909263x|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=132|issue=1|pages=76–78|doi=10.1021/ja909263x|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; but commercial technology is based on amine solvents.&lt;ref name="Imperial College Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smit|first1=Bernard|last2=Reimer|first2=Jeffrey A.|last3=Oldenburg|first3=Curtis M.|last4=Bourg|first4=Ian C.|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration|date=2014|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=Hackensack, NJ|isbn=978-1-78326-328-8|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One method to separate carbon dioxide exploits differences in its permeability. Because of the tunability of the pores, zeolites have been used to separate carbon dioxide. The pore size ranges from 3-12 Angstroms. Because the size of a carbon dioxide molecule is approximately 5.4 Angstroms, zeolites with a pore size of 4-5 Angstroms can be a great fit for carbon capture. However, there are factors other than just pore size that need to be considered when determining how effective zeolites will be at carbon capture. The first is basicity, which can be created by doing an alkali metal cation exchange. The second is the Si/Al ratio which impacts the cation exchange capacity. To get a higher adsorption capacity, there must be a lower Si/Al ratio in order to increase the cation exchange capacity.

Zif’s 68, 69, 70, 78, 81, 82, 95, and 100 have been found to have very high uptake capacity, meaning that they can store a lot of carbon dioxide even if they don’t have extremely high affinities. Of those, 68, 69, and 70 show high affinities for carbon dioxide, evidenced by their adsorption isotherms, which show steep uptakes at low pressures. One liter of ZIF can hold 83 liters of {{co2}}. This could also be useful for [[Pressure swing adsorption|pressure-swing adsorption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phan|first=Anh|last2=Doonan|first2=Christian J.|last3=Uribe-Romo|first3=Fernando J.|last4=Knobler|first4=Carolyn B.|last5=O'Keeffe|first5=Michael|last6=Yaghi|first6=Omar M.|display-authors=3|date=2010-01-19|title=Synthesis, structure, and carbon dioxide capture properties of zeolitic imidazolate frameworks|journal=Accounts of Chemical Research|volume=43|issue=1|pages=58–67|doi=10.1021/ar900116g|issn=1520-4898|pmid=19877580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other separation applications ===
Much ZIF research focuses on the separation of hydrogen and carbon dioxide because a well-studied ZIF, ZIF-8, has a very high separation factor for hydrogen and carbon dioxide mixtures. It is also very good for the separation of hydrocarbon mixtures, like the following: 
* Ethane-propane = 80
* Ethylene- propylene = 10
* Ethylene- propane = 167
In addition to gas separations, ZIF’s have the potential to separate components of biofuels, specifically, water and ethanol. Of all of the ZIF’s that have been tested, ZIF-8 shows high selectivity. ZIF’s have also shown potential in separating other alcohols, like propanol and butanol, from water. Typically, water and ethanol (or other alcohols) are separated using distillation, however ZIF’s offer a potential lower-energy separation option.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Kang|last2=Nalaparaju|first2=Anjaiah|last3=Chen|first3=Yifei|last4=Jiang|first4=Jianwen|date=2014-04-23|title=Biofuel purification in zeolitic imidazolate frameworks: the significant role of functional groups|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2014/CP/c4cp00739e#!divAbstract|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|language=en|volume=16|issue=20|doi=10.1039/C4CP00739E|issn=1463-9084|bibcode=2014PCCP...16.9643Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Catalysis ===
ZIF’s also have great potential as heterogeneous catalysts; ZIF-8 has been shown to act as good catalysts for the transesterification of vegetable oils, the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction between benzoyl chloride and anisole, and for the formation of carbonates. ZIF-8 nanoparticles can also be used to enhance the performance in the [[Knoevenagel condensation]] reaction between benzaldehyde and malononitrile.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guan|first=Yebin|last2=Shi|first2=Juanjuan|last3=Xia|first3=Ming|last4=Zhanga|first4=Jun|last5=Pang|first5=Zhenfeng|last6=Marchetti|first6=Alessandro|last7=Wang|first7=Xiaohong|last8=Cai|first8=Jingsong|last9=Kong|first9=Xueqian|display-authors=3|date=2017-11-30|title= Monodispersed ZIF-8 particles with enhanced performance for CO2 adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis |journal=Applied Surface Science|language=en|volume=423|issue=|pages= 349-353 |doi=10.1016/j.apsusc.2017.06.183|issn=|bibcode=2017ApSS..423..349G}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZIF’s have also been shown to work well in oxidation and epoxidation reactions; ZIF-9 has been shown to catalyze the aerobic oxidation of tetralin and the oxidation of many other small molecules. It can also catalyze reactions to produce hydrogen at room temperature, specifically the dehydrogenation of dimethylamine borane and [[sodium|Na]][[borohydride|BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] hydrolysis.

=== Sensing and Electronic Devices ===
ZIF’s are also good candidates for chemical sensors because of their tunable adsorbance properties. ZIF-8 exhibits sensitivity when exposed to the vapor of ethanol and water mixtures, and this response is dependent on the concentration of ethanol in the mixture.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Binling|last2=Yang|first2=Zhuxian|last3=Zhu|first3=Yanqiu|last4=Xia|first4=Yongde|date=2014-09-23|title=Zeolitic imidazolate framework materials: recent progress in synthesis and applications|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/ta/c4ta02984d#!divAbstract|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry A|language=en|volume=2|issue=40|doi=10.1039/C4TA02984D|issn=2050-7496}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, ZIF’s are attractive materials for matrices for biosensors, like electrochemical biosensors, for in-vivo electrochemical measurements. They also have potential applications as luminescent probes for the detection of metal ions and small molecules. ZIF-8 luminescence is highly sensitive to Cu2+, and Cd2+ ions as well as acetone. ZIF nanoparticles can also sense fluorescently tagged single stranded pieces of DNA.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Drug Delivery ===
Because ZIF’s are porous, chemically stable, thermally stable, and tunable, they are potentially a platform for drug delivery and controlled drug release. ZIF-8 is very stable in water and aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions but decompose quickly in acidic solutions, indicating a pH sensitivity that could aid in the development of ZIF-based drug-release platforms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== ZIFS vs MOFs ===

While ZIFs are a subset of the MOF hybrids that combine organic and metal frameworks to create hybrid microporous and crystalline structures, they are much more restricted in their structure. Similar to MOFs, most ZIF properties are largely dependent on the properties of the metal clusters, ligands, and synthesis conditions in which they were created.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basnayake|first=Sajani A.|last2=Su|first2=Jie|last3=Zou|first3=Xiadong|last4=Balkus|first4=Kenneth J.|date=2015-02-04|title=Carbonate-Based Zeolitic Imidazolate Frame for Highly Selective CO2 Capture|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ic5027174|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|language=en|volume=54|issue=4|doi=10.1021/ic5027174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ZIF alterations up to this point have involved changing the linkers - bridging O2- anions and imizazolate-based ligands&lt;ref name="Imperial College Press"/&gt; - or combining two types of linkers to change bond angles or pore size due to limitations in synthesizing methods and production.&lt;ref name=methane&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nguyen|first=Nhung T.

Despite these similarities with MOFs, ZIFs have significant properties that distinguish these structures as uniquely to be applied to carbon capture processes. Because ZIFs tend to resemble the crystalline framework of zeolites, their thermal and chemical stability are higher than those of other MOFs, allowing them to work at a wider range in temperatures, making them suitable to chemical processes.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"/&gt;

Perhaps the most important difference is the ZIFs hydrophobic properties and water stability. A main issue with zeolites and MOFs, to a certain extent, was their adsorption of water along with CO2.[7] Water vapor is often found in carbon-rich exhaust gases, and MOFs would absorb the water, lowering the amount of CO2 required to reach saturation.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"/&gt; MOFs are also less stable in moist and oxygen rich environments due to metal-oxygen bonds performing hydrolysis. ZIFs, however, have nearly identical performances in dry and humid conditions, showing much higher CO2 selectivity over water, allowing the adsorbent to store more carbon before saturation is reached.&lt;ref name=methane/&gt;

=== ZIFs vs commercially available products ===

Even in comparison with other materials, the ZIFs most attractive quality is still its hydrophobic properties. When compared to ZIFs in dry conditions, activated carbon was nearly identical with its uptake capacity.&lt;ref name=methane/&gt; However, once the conditions were changed to wet, the activated carbon’s uptake was halved. When this saturation and regeneration tests were run at these conditions, ZIFs also showed minimal to no structural degradation, a good indication of the adsorbent’s re-usability.&lt;ref name=methane/&gt;

However, ZIFs tend to be expensive to synthesize. MOFs require synthesis methods with long reaction periods, high pressures, and high temperatures, which aren’t methods that are easy to scale-up.&lt;ref name="Basnayake"/&gt; ZIFs do tend to be more affordable than commercially available non-ZIF MOFs.

When combined with polymer-sorbent materials, research determined that hybrid polymer-ZIF sorbent membranes no longer following the upper bound of the Robeson plot, which is a plot of selectivity as a function of permeation for [[membrane gas separation]].&lt;ref name="Imperial College Press"/&gt;
