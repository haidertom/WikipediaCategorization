[[File:Reel-to-ReelTapeBigHub.agr.jpg|thumb|[[Magnetic tape]] was commonly used to create master copies.]]
'''Mastering''', a form of [[audio post production]], is the process of preparing and transferring recorded audio from a source containing the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|final mix]] to a [[data storage device]] (the master), the source from which all copies will be produced (via methods such as pressing, duplication or [[Replication (optical media)|replication]]). In recent years [[digital master]]s have become usual, although analog masters, such as audio tapes, are still being used by the manufacturing industry, notably by a few engineers who have chosen to specialize in analog mastering.

Mastering requires critical listening; however, software tools exist to facilitate the process. Results still depend upon the intent of the engineer, the accuracy of the speaker monitors, and the listening environment. [[Mastering engineer]]s may also need to apply corrective equalization and dynamic compression in order to optimise sound translation on all playback systems.&lt;ref name="mixmagazine" /&gt; It is standard practice to make a copy of a master recording, known as a safety copy, in case the master is lost, damaged or stolen.

==History==

===Pre-1940s===
In the earliest days of the recording industry, all phases of the recording and mastering process were entirely achieved by mechanical processes. Performers sang and/or played into a large acoustic horn and the master recording was created by the direct transfer of acoustic energy from the [[Diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] of the recording horn to the [[mastering lathe]], typically located in an adjoining room. The cutting head, driven by the energy transferred from the horn, inscribed a modulated groove into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc.&lt;ref name=Auld&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.recordingmag.com/resources/resourceDetail/109.html |title=Mastering Then and Now |author=Robert Auld |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; These masters were usually made from either a soft metal alloy or from [[wax]]; this gave rise to the colloquial term ''waxing'', referring to the cutting of a record.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_UDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=New Technique Aids LP Waxing |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=1950-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the introduction of the [[microphone]] and [[electronic amplifier]] in the mid-1920s, the mastering process became electro-mechanical, and electrically driven mastering lathes came into use for cutting master discs (the cylinder format by then having been superseded). Until the introduction of tape recording, master recordings were almost always cut [[Direct to disc recording|direct-to-disc]].&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt; Only a small minority of recordings were mastered using previously recorded material sourced from other discs.

===Emergence of magnetic tape===
In the late 1940s, the recording industry was revolutionized by the introduction of [[magnetic tape]]. Magnetic tape was invented for recording sound by [[Fritz Pfleumer]] in 1928 in Germany, based on the invention of [[magnetic wire recording]] by [[Valdemar Poulsen]] in 1898.  Not until the end of [[World War II]] could the technology be found outside Europe. The introduction of magnetic tape recording enabled master discs to be cut separately in time and space from the actual recording process.&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt;

Although tape and other technical advances dramatically improved audio quality of commercial recordings in the post-war years, the basic constraints of the electro-mechanical mastering process remained, and the inherent physical limitations of the main commercial recording media—the 78 rpm disc and later the 7-inch 45 rpm single and 33-1/3 rpm [[Gramophone record|LP record]]—meant that the audio quality, [[dynamic range]],{{efn|Dynamic range was limited by the fact that if the mastering level was set too high, the cutting head might be damaged during the cutting process or the stylus may jump out of the groove during playback.&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt;}} and running time{{efn|Running times were constrained by the diameter of the disc and the density with which grooves could be inscribed on the surface without cutting into each other.}} of master discs were still limited compared to later media such as the [[compact disc]].

===Electro-mechanical mastering process===
From the 1950s until the advent of digital recording in the late 1970s, the mastering process typically went through several stages. Once the studio recording on multi-track tape was complete, a final [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mix]] was prepared and dubbed down to the master tape, usually either a single-track [[Monaural|mono]] or two-track [[stereo]] tape. Prior to the cutting of the master disc, the master tape was often subjected to further electronic treatment by a specialist [[mastering engineer]]. 

After the advent of tape it was found that, especially for pop recordings, master recordings could be made so that the resulting record would sound better. This was done by making fine adjustments to the amplitude of sound at different frequency bands ([[Equalization (audio)|equalization]]) prior to the cutting of the master disc. Record mastering became a highly prized and skilled craft, and it was widely recognized that good mastering could make or break a commercial pop recording. As a result, the independent mastering studio was born. Early independent mastering engineers included [[Doug Sax]], [[Bob Ludwig]], [[Bob Katz]] and [[Bernie Grundman]] and Denny Purcell.&lt;ref name=Auld/&gt;

In large recording companies such as [[EMI]], the mastering process was usually controlled by specialist staff technicians who were conservative in their work practices. These big companies were often reluctant to make changes to their recording and production processes. For example, EMI was very slow in taking up innovations in [[multi-track recording]]{{efn|In [[multi-track recording]] each signal input is recorded to its own track on a multi-track recorder. This multi-track tape is mixed down to a mono or stereo master tape. A multi-track tape may be remixed many times, in different ways, by different engineers, giving the possibility of several masters (mono version, stereo version, LP version, AM radio version, single version, etc.).}} and they did not install 8-track recorders in their [[Abbey Road Studios]] until the late 1960s, more than a decade after the first commercial 8-track recorders were installed by American independent studios.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=George|authorlink1=George Martin|last2=Hornsby|first2=Jeremy|title=All you need is ears|year=1994|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-11482-6|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital technology===
[[File:Optimum-mix-levels-for-mast.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Optimum Digital Levels with respect to the Full Digital Scale (dBFSD)]]
In the 1990s, electro-mechanical processes were largely superseded by digital technology, with digital recordings stored on [[hard disk drive]]s or digital tape and mastered to [[CD]]. The [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) became common in many mastering facilities, allowing the off-line manipulation of recorded audio via a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI).  Although many digital processing tools are common during mastering, it is also very common to use analog media and processing equipment for the mastering stage. Just as in other areas of audio, the benefits and drawbacks of [[Comparison of analog and digital recording|digital technology compared to analog technology]] are still a matter for debate. However, in the field of audio mastering, the debate is usually over the use of digital versus analog signal processing rather than the use of digital technology for storage of audio.&lt;ref name="mixmagazine"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://mixonline.com/recording/mastering/audio_issues_modern_mastering |work=Mix Magazine |title=Issues in Modern Mastering |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070524113354/http://mixonline.com/recording/mastering/audio_issues_modern_mastering/ |archive-date=May 24, 2007 |date=May 1, 2006 |author=Blair Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital systems have higher performance and allow mixing to be performed at lower maximum levels. With peaks between -3 and -9 dBFS on a mix, the mastering engineer has enough [[Headroom (audio signal processing)|headroom]] to process and produce a final master.&lt;ref name="bob_katz"&gt;[http://www.digido.com/bob-katz/mixing-tips-and-tricks.html Bob Katz Mixing Tips] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827154625/http://www.digido.com/bob-katz/mixing-tips-and-tricks.html |date=August 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to allow enough headroom for the mastering engineer's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdmusicmastering.com/how-much-headroom-for-mastering.html How much headroom for mastering?] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20130119000648/http://cdmusicmastering.com/how-much-headroom-for-mastering.html |date=January 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reduction of headroom by the mix or mastering engineer has resulted in a [[loudness war]] in commercial recordings.&lt;ref name="Shelvock" /&gt;

== Process ==
[[File:Manleyvarimu.jpg|thumb|A common mastering processor for [[dynamic range compression]]]]
The source material, ideally at the original resolution, is processed using [[equalization (audio)|equalization]], [[Dynamic range compression|compression]], [[limiting]] and other processes. Additional operations, such as editing, specifying the gaps between tracks, adjusting level, fading in and out, [[Audio noise reduction|noise reduction]] and other signal restoration and enhancement processes can also be applied as part of the mastering stage.&lt;ref name="Shelvock"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Audio Mastering as Musical Practice|last = Shelvock|first = Matt|publisher = ETDR: University of Western Ontario|year = 2012|isbn = |location = Ontario, Canada|pages = 1–72|url = http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1709&amp;context=etd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source material is put in the proper order, commonly referred to as assembly (or 'track') sequencing. These operations prepare the music for either digital or analog, e.g. vinyl, replication.&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

If the material is destined for vinyl release, additional processing, such as dynamic range reduction or frequency dependent stereo–to–mono fold-down and equalization, may be applied to compensate for the limitations of that medium. Finally, for compact disc release, Start of Track, End of Track, and Indexes are defined for disc navigation. Subsequently, it is rendered either to a physical medium, such as a CD-R or DVD-R, or to computer files, such as a [[Disc Description Protocol]] (DDP) file set or an ISO file. The specific medium varies, depending on the intended release format of the final product. For [[digital audio]] releases, there is more than one possible master medium, chosen based on replication factory requirements or record label security concerns. Regardless of what delivery method is chosen, the replicator will transfer the audio to a [[Compact Disc manufacturing|glass master]] that will generate metal stampers for replication.

The process of audio mastering varies depending on the specific needs of the audio to be processed. Mastering engineers need to examine the types of input media, the expectations of the source producer or recipient, the limitations of the end medium and process the subject accordingly. General rules of thumb can rarely be applied.

Steps of the process typically include the following:
# Transferring the recorded audio tracks into the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).
# Sequence the separate songs or tracks  as they will appear on the final release.
# Adjust the length of the silence between songs.
# Process or "sweeten" audio to maximize the sound quality for the intended medium (e.g. applying specific EQ for vinyl).
# Transfer the audio to the final master format (CD-ROM, half-inch reel tape, PCM 1630 U-matic tape, etc.).

Examples of possible actions taken during mastering:&lt;ref name="Shelvock" /&gt;
# Editing minor flaws.
# Applying [[noise reduction]] to eliminate clicks, dropouts, hum and hiss.
# Adjusting stereo width.
# Adding ambience.
# Equalize audio across tracks for the purpose of optimized frequency distribution.
# Adjust volume.
# Dynamic range compression or expansion.
# [[Limiter|Peak limit]].
# [[Dither]].

&lt;!--These topics are covered more comprehensively and in more accessible terms in the second paragraph of this section. Perhaps better to incorporate any new contribution there than to dangle it here--&gt;To finish mastering a CD, track markers must be inserted, along with [[International Standard Recording Code]] (ISRC) and other information necessary to replicate a CD. Vinyl LP and cassettes have their own pre-duplication requirements for a finished master.

==Significance==
&lt;!--I'm not convinced of the significance of this bit but better to move it here for review than have it dangling at the end of the History section for no apparent reason--&gt;
Mastering has a special significance for house, techno and other styles of electronic dance music:
{{quote|...the product of mastering, regardless of the type of format, is re-actualised into a performance in the hands of the DJ. In this regard, the shift from vinyl records to digital formats in many DJ scenes and the appearance of new digital formats for DJs have encouraged new practices also among mastering engineers, whose targets are not only music listeners but, specifically, music performers as well.&lt;ref&gt;Nardi, Carlo (2014).

[[image:RA6cab.jpg|thumb|300px|RA-6 Reactor core, Pale blue light product of [[Cherenkov effect]].]]
The '''Bariloche Atomic Centre''' ({{lang-es|Centro Atómico Bariloche}}) is one of the research and development centres of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[National Atomic Energy Commission]]. As its name implies, it is located in the city of [[San Carlos de Bariloche]]. Bariloche Atomic Centre is responsible for research in [[physics]] and [[nuclear engineering]]. It also hosts the [[Balseiro Institute]], a collaboration between [[National University of Cuyo]] and the [[National Atomic Energy Commission]]. The Bariloche Atomic Centre opened in 1955 with its first director, [[José Antonio Balseiro]].

== Activity ==
The centre is devoted to basic and applied physics research as well as Nuclear and Mechanical Engineering.

Basic research is focused on deepening understanding of nuclear energy. Applied sciences have provided support for both state- and privately owned companies. The main areas of research include: materials, neutrons, thermodynamics and theoretical physics.

Nuclear Engineering at the Centre is aimed at further developing Argentina's atomic technology. Most of the research is done taking advantage of RA-6, a 1 [[Megawatt|MW]] experimental reactor. Experiments done with the RA-6 include irradiation and radioactive activation of several materials.

Some research groups also focus on refining reactor calculations and performance measurements and designing mechanical devices for those tasks.

Various companies have sprung out of the Bariloche Aromic Center, such as [[INVAP]] y ALTEC.

== Biography ==
Born on 2 December 1944 in [[Kolkata]], in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] to Bhabaranjan-Malancha couple, Bhattacharyya graduated in chemistry from the [[University of Calcutta]] and secured his master's degree in physical chemistry from the same university.&lt;ref name="Indian Fellow - Bhattacharya" /&gt; Subsequently, he joined the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata and pursued his doctoral studies to secure the degree under the guidance of Uma Shankar Nandi of the [[Indian Institute of Science]]. Moving to the US, he completed his post-doctoral studies at the laboratory of Jan Wolff of the [[National Institutes of Health]].

{{about|the conservation biology topic|other uses of "BAP"|BAP (disambiguation)}}

A '''biodiversity action plan''' ('''BAP''') is an internationally recognized program addressing [[threatened species]] and [[habitat]]s and is designed to protect and restore biological systems. The original impetus for these plans derives from the 1992 [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD). As of 2009, 191 countries have ratified the CBD, but only a fraction of these have developed substantive BAP documents.

The principal elements of a BAP typically include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Glowka |first=Lyle |author2=Françoise Burhenne-Guilmin |author3=Hugh Synge |author4=Jeffrey A. McNeely |author5=Lothar Gündling |title=Guide to the Convention on Biodiversity |year=1994 |publisher=IUCN |isbn=2-8317-0222-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a) preparing inventories of biological information for selected species or habitats; (b) assessing the [[conservation status]] of species within specified [[ecosystem]]s; (c) creation of targets for [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Restoration ecology|restoration]]; and (d) establishing budgets, timelines and institutional partnerships for implementing the BAP.

==Species plans==
[[File:Lightmatter snowleopard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Snow leopard]], Pakistan, an endangered species]]

A fundamental method of engagement to a BAP is thorough documentation regarding individual species, with emphasis upon the population distribution and [[Conservation biology|conservation]] status. This task, while fundamental, is highly daunting, since only an estimated ten percent of the world’s species are believed to have been characterized as of 2006,&lt;ref name="IUCN"&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 IUCN Red-list statistics (2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630000000/http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 |date=June 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of these unknowns being [[fungi]], [[invertebrate]] animals, micro-organisms and plants. For many bird, mammal and reptile species, information is often available in published literature; however, for fungi, invertebrate animals, micro-organisms and many plants, such information may require considerable local data collection. It is also useful to compile time trends of population estimates in order to understand the dynamics of population variability and vulnerability. In some parts of the world complete species inventories are not realistic; for example, in the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]], many species are completely undocumented and much of the region has never even been systematically explored by scientists.

A species plan component of a country’s BAP should ideally entail a thorough description of the range, habitat, behaviour, breeding and interaction with other species. Once a determination has been made of conservation status (e.g. [[rare species|rare]], endangered, threatened, vulnerable), a plan can then be created to conserve and restore the species population to target levels. Examples of programmatic protection elements are: habitat restoration; protection of habitat from [[urban development]]; establishment of property ownership; limitations on grazing or other agricultural encroachment into habitat; reduction of [[slash-and-burn]] agricultural practises; outlawing killing or collecting the species; restrictions on pesticide use; and control of other environmental pollution. The plan should also articulate which public and private agencies should implement the protection strategy and indicate budgets available to execute this strategy.

==Habitat plans==
Where a number of threatened species depend upon a specific habitat, it may be appropriate to prepare a habitat protection element of the Biodiversity Action Plan. Examples of such special habitats are: raised acidic bogs of Scotland; [[Waterberg Biosphere]] [[bushveld]] in South Africa; California’s coastal [[wetland]]s; and Sweden’s [[Stora Alvaret]] on the island of [[Öland]]. In this case also, careful inventories of species and also the geographic extent and quality of the habitat must be documented. Then, as with species plans, a program can be created to protect, enhance and/or restore habitat using similar strategies as discussed above under the species plans.

==Specific countries==
Some examples of individual countries which have produced substantive Biodiversity Action Plans follow. In every example the plans concentrate on plants and vertebrate animals, with very little attention to neglected groups such as fungi, invertebrate animals and micro-organisms, even though these are also part of biodiversity. Preparation of a country BAP may cost up to 100 million pounds sterling, with annual maintenance costs roughly ten percent of the initial cost. If plans took into account neglected groups, the cost would be higher. Obviously costs for countries with small geographical area or simplified ecosystems have a much lesser cost. For example, the St. Lucia BAP has been costed in the area of several million pounds sterling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2001| author=Government of St. Lucia| title=National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan of St. Lucia| url=http://www.slubiodiv.org/The_Project/Information/Printed_Materials/NBSAP/nbsap.html| accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061105113956/http://www.slubiodiv.org/The_Project/Information/Printed_Materials/NBSAP/nbsap.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Daintree Rainforest.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Daintree Rainforest]] in [[Queensland]], Australia]]
Australia has developed a detailed and rigorous Biodiversity Action Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2011| author=Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council| title=Australia's Biodiversity Conservation Strategy 2010-2030| url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/au/au-nbsap-v2-en.pdf| accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document estimates that the total number of indigenous species may be 560,000, many of which are endemic. A key element of the BAP is protection of the [[Great Barrier Reef]], which is actually in a much higher state of health than most of the world’s [[reef]]s, Australia having one of the highest percentages of treated [[wastewater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=September 2005| author=Commonwealth of Australia, Department of the Environment and Heritage| title=Great Barrier Reef Water Quality Protection Plan Annual Report 2004-2005| url=http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/publications/annual-report/04-05/index.html| accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060822025646/http://www.deh.gov.au/coasts/publications/annual-report/04-05/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however,serious ongoing concerns, particularly in regards to the ongoing negative impact on water quality from land use practices. Also, climate change impact is feared to be significant.

Considerable analysis has been conducted on the [[Sustainable forestry|sustainable]] yield of firewood production, a major threat to [[deforestation]] in most tropical countries. Biological inventory work; assessment of harvesting practices; and computer modeling of the dynamics of treefall, rot and harvest; have been carried out to adduce data on safe harvesting rates. Extensive research has also been conducted on the relation of brush clearance to [[biodiversity]] decline and impact on [[water table]]s;&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Glanznig, ''Native Vegetation Clearance, Habitat Loss and Biodiversity Decline: an overview of recent native vegetation clearance in Australia and its implications for biodiversity'', Biodiversity Series, Paper No. 6, Biodiversity Unit, June 1995&lt;/ref&gt; for example, these effects have been analyzed in the [[Toolibin Lake]] wetlands region.

===New Zealand===
{{See also|Biodiversity of New Zealand}}
New Zealand has ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity and as part of The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy and Biodiversity Action Plans are implemented on ten separate themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Dept. of Conservation; Ministry for the Environment| isbn = 978-0-478-21919-7| title = The New Zealand Biodiversity Strategy| location = [Wellington, N.Z.]| date = February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local government and some companies also have their own Biodiversity Action Plan.

===St. Lucia===
The [[St. Lucia]] BAP recognizes impacts of large numbers of tourists to the marine and coastal diversity of the [[Soufrière, Saint Lucia|Soufrière]] area of the country. The BAP specifically acknowledges that the [[carrying capacity]] for human use and [[water pollution]] discharge of sensitive reef areas was exceeded by the year 1990. The plan also addresses conservation of the historic island fishing industry. In 1992, several institutions in conjunction with native fishermen to produce a sustainable management plan for fishery resources, embodied in the Soufrière Marine Management Area.

The St. Lucia BAP features significant involvement from the [[University of the West Indies]]. Specific detailed attention is given to three species of threatened marine turtles, to a variety of vulnerable birds and a number of [[pelagic fish]]es and [[cetacean]]s. In terms of [[habitat conservation]] the plan focusses attention on the biologically productive [[mangrove]] swamps and notes that virtually all mangrove areas had already come under national protection by 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''St. Lucia National Marine Fisheries Act of 1984, Section 10'', (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanzania===
The Tanzania national BAP addresses issues related to sustainable use of [[Lake Manyara]], an extensive freshwater lake, whose usage by humans accelerated in the period 1950 to 1990. The designation of the [[Lake Manyara Biosphere Reserve]] under [[UNESCO]]'s [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]] in 1981 combines conservation of the lake and surrounding high value forests with sustainable use of the wetlands area and simple agriculture. This BAP has united principal lake users in establishing management targets. The biosphere reserve has induced sustainable management of the wetlands, including monitoring [[groundwater]] and the chemistry of the [[escarpment]] water source.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lake Manyara|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=URT+01|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Fowlsheughclifftonorthsea.JPG|thumb|[[Fowlsheugh]] cliffs, [[Scotland]], a protected [[seabird]] breeding habitat]]
The [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]] covers not only [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] species associated with lands within the UK, but also marine species and [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds, which spend a limited time in the UK or its offshore waters. The UK plan encompasses "391 Species Action Plans, 45 Habitat Action Plans and 162 Local Biodiversity Action Plans with targeted actions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan| url=http://www.ukbap.org.uk/| author=Joint Nature Conservation Committee, London| year=2006| accessdate=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan is noteworthy because of its extensive detail, clarity of endangerment mechanisms, specificity of actions, follow up monitoring program and its inclusion of migrating cetaceans and pelagic birds.

On August 28, 2007, the new Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) [launched in 1997] identified 1,149 species and 65 habitats in the UK that needed conservation and greater protection. The updated list included the [[hedgehog]], [[house sparrow]], [[grass snake]] and the [[garden tiger moth]], while [[otter]]s, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s and [[red squirrel]]s remained in need of habitat protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6965681.stm BBC NEWS, Hedgehogs join 'protection' list]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the European Commission adopted a new strategy to halt the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the EU by 2020, in line with the commitments made at the 10th meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) held in Nagoya, Japan in 2010. In 2012 the UK BAP was succeeded by the 'UK Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework'.

==== UK BAP website ====
To support the work of the UK BAP, the UK BAP website was created by JNCC in 2001. The website contained information on the BAP process, hosted all relevant documents, and provided news and relevant updates. In March 2011, as part of the UK government’s review of websites, the UK BAP site was ‘closed’, and the core content was migrated into the JNCC website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Biodiversity Action Plan| url=http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=5155| author=Joint Nature Conservation Committee, London| year=2012| accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Content from the original UK BAP website has been archived by the [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] as snapshots from various dates (for example, UK ''BAP'': copy March 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=UK Biodiversity Action Plan archive copy| url=http://www.ukbap.org.uk/default.aspx| author=National Archives, London| year=2011| accessdate=2012-10-28| deadurl=yes| archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110303145238/http://www.ukbap.org.uk/default.aspx| archivedate=March 3, 2011| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
Twenty-six years prior to the international biodiversity convention, the United States had launched a national program to protect threatened species in the form of the 1966 [[Endangered Species Act]]. The legislation created broad authority for analyzing and listing species of concern, and mandated that Species [[Endangered Species Recovery Plan|Recovery Plan]]s be created. Thus, while the USA is an unratified signer of the accord, arguably it has the longest track record and most comprehensive program of species protection of any country. There are about 7000 listed species (e.g. endangered or threatened), of which about half have approved Recovery Plans. While this number of species seems high compared to other countries, the value is rather indicative of the total number of species characterized, which is extremely large.

===Uzbekistan===
Five major divisions of habitat have been identified in [[Uzbekistan]]’s BAP: Wetlands (including reed habitat and man-made [[marsh]]); desert ecosystems (including sandy, stony and clay); [[steppes]]; [[riparian]] ecosystems; and mountain ecosystems. Over 27,000 species have been inventoried in the country, with a high rate of [[endemism]] for fishes and reptiles. Principal threats to biodiversity are related to human activities associated with overpopulation and generally related to agricultural intensification.&lt;ref&gt;''Biodiversity Conservation National Strategy and Action Plan of Republic of Uzbekistan'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Major geographic regions encompassed by the BAP include the [[Aral Sea]] Programme (threatened by long-term drainage and [[salination]], largely for cotton production), the Nuratau Biosphere Reserve, and the Western [[Tien Shan Mountains]] Programme (in conjunction with [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]).

==Criticism==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
Some developing countries criticize the emphasis of BAPs, because these plans inherently favour consideration of [[wildlife]] protection above food and industrial production, and in some cases may represent an obstacle to population growth. The plans are costly to produce, a fact which makes it difficult for many smaller countries and poorer countries to comply. In terms of the plans themselves, many countries have adopted pro-forma plans including little research and even less in the way of natural resource management. Almost universally, this has resulted in plans which emphasize plants and vertebrate animals, and which overlook fungi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Micheli Guide to Fungal Conservation| url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli.htm| author=International Society for Fungal Conservation| year=2012| accessdate=2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; invertebrate animals and micro-organisms. With regard to specific world regions, there is a notable lack of substantive participation by most of the Middle Eastern countries and much of Africa, the latter of which may be impeded by economic considerations of plan preparation. Some governments such as the [[European Union]] have diverted the purpose of a biodiversity action plan, and implemented the convention accord by a set of economic development policies with referencing certain ecosystems' protection.

==Biodiversity planning: a new way of thinking==
The definition of biodiversity under the Convention on Biological Diversity now recognises that biodiversity is a combination of ecosystem structure and function, as much as its components e.g. species, habitats and genetic resources. Article 2 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''in addressing the boundless complexity of biological diversity, it has become conventional to think in hierarchical terms, from the genetic material within individual cells, building up through individual organisms, populations, species and communities of species, to the biosphere overall...At the same time, in seeking to make management intervention as efficient as possible, it is essential to take an holistic view of biodiversity and address the interactions that species have with each other and their non-living environment, i.e. to work from an ecological perspective.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The World Summit on Sustainable Development endorsed the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity to ''“achieve by 2010 a significant reduction of the current rate of [[biodiversity loss]] at the global, regional and national level as a contribution to poverty alleviation and to the benefit of life on Earth”.'' To achieve this outcome, biodiversity management will depend on maintaining structure and function.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, R.F. (1990) Indicators for Monitoring Biodiversity: A Hierarchical Approach. Conservation Biology 4 (4) 355–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biodiversity is not singularly definable but may be understood via a series of management principles under BAPs, such as:

1. that biodiversity is conserved across all levels and scales – structure, function and composition are conserved at site, regional, state and national scales. 
2. that examples of all ecological communities are adequately managed for conservation.  
3. ecological communities are managed to support and enhance viable populations of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants and ecological functions.

Biodiversity and wildlife are not the same thing. The traditional focus on threatened species in BAPs is at odds with the principles of biodiversity management because, by the time species become threatened, the processes that maintain biodiversity are already compromised. Individual species are also regarded as generally poor indicators of biodiversity when it comes to actual planning.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenmayer, D. B., Manning, A. D., Smith, P. L., Possingham, Hugh P., Fischer, J., Oliver, I., McCarthy, M. A., (2002) The Focal-Species Approach and Landscape Restoration: A Conservation Biology 16(2) 338–345&lt;/ref&gt; A species approach to BAPs only serves to identify and at best, apply a patch to existing problems. Increasingly, biodiversity planners are looking through the lens of [[ecosystem services]]. Critics of biodiversity are often confusing the need to protect species (their intrinsic value) with the need to maintain ecosystem processes, which ultimately maintain human society and do not compromise economic development. Hence, a core principle of biodiversity management, that traditional BAPs overlook, is the need to incorporate cultural, social and economic values in the process.

Modern day BAPs use an analysis of [[ecosystem services]], key ecological process drivers, and use species as one of many indicators of change. They would seek to maintain structure and function by addressing habitat connectivity and resilience and may look at communities of species (threatened or otherwise) as one method of monitoring outcomes. Ultimately, species are the litmus test for biodiversity – viable populations of species can only be expected to exist in relatively intact habitats. However, the rationale behind BAPs is to "conserve and restore" biodiversity. One of the fastest developing areas of management is [http://www.bioenergywiki.net/index.php/Biodiversity_Offsets biodiversity offsets]. The principles are in keeping with ecological impact assessment, which in turn depends on good quality BAPs for evaluation. Contemporary principles of biodiversity management, such as those produced by the [http://www.forest-trends.org/biodiversityoffsetprogram/ Business Biodiversity Offsets Program]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://eianzecology.blogspot.com/2009/03/principles-in-biodiversity-offsets.html|title= Principles in Biodiversity Offsets}}&lt;/ref&gt; are now integral to any plans to manage biodiversity, including the development of BAPs.

'''Blasticidin S''' is an [[antibiotic]] that is produced by ''[[Streptomyces griseochromogenes]]''.  In biological research, specifically [[genetic engineering]], it is used to select transformed cells which have been engineered to carry a resistance gene for blasticidin.  In short, [[DNA]] of interest is fused to DNA encoding a resistance gene, and then is transformed into cells.  After allowing time for recovery and for cells to begin transcribing and translating their new DNA, blasticidin is added.  Now only the cells that have the new DNA can grow.

== History ==
In the 1950s, a drug screening program was designed in [[Japan]] to discover a new antibiotic that prevents [[Magnaporthe grisea|Blast Disease]] by the [[fungus]] ''[[Magnaporthe grisea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Natural Products Isolation: Separation Methods for Antimicrobials, Antivirals, and Enzyme Inhibitors. Wagman G. H., Elsevier R. C.; p. 191 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resistance genes ==
Three resistance genes have been cloned:

*  bls (an [[acetyltransferase]]), isolated from ''[[Streptoverticillium]] sp.'', which itself produces blasticidin in a natural example of biological warfare.
* bsr (a [[blasticidin-S deaminase]]), isolated from ''[[Bacillus cereus]]'' (other bsr genes are known as well, see listings in [[Genbank]]).
* BSD (another [[deaminase]]), isolated from ''[[Aspergillus terreus]]''.

bsr and BSD are the most commonly used resistance genes.  The proteins produced from these genes enable the cells carrying them to produce proteins in the presence of blasticidin.

== Mechanism of action ==
Blasticidin prevents the growth of both [[eukaryotic]] and [[prokaryotic]] cells.  It works by inhibiting termination step of translation and peptide bond formation (to lesser extent) by the [[ribosome]].  This means that cells can no longer produce new proteins through [[translation (genetics)|translation]] of [[mRNA]].

A capability may or may not be accompanied by an intention.&lt;ref&gt;"Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms", Joint Publication 1-02, DoD, 17 March 2009 {{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123014953/http://www.dtic.mil/doctrine/jel/new_pubs/jp1_02.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is used in the [[defense industry]] but also in [[private industry]] (e.g. [[Gap analysis]]).

A '''caruncle''' is defined as 'a small, fleshy excrescence that is a normal part of an animal's anatomy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexic.us/definition-of/caruncle|title=Definition of caruncle|author=Lexic.us|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this definition, caruncles in birds include [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]] (or [[dewlaps]]), [[Snood (anatomy)|snoods]], and earlobes. The term caruncle is derived from Latin 'caruncula', the diminutive of 'carō', flesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/caruncle|title=Caruncle|author=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Caruncles are carnosities, often of bright colors such as red, blue, yellow or white.  They can be present on the head, neck, throat, cheeks or around the eyes of some birds. They may be present as [[Comb (anatomy)|combs or crests]] and other structures near the beak, or, hanging from the throat or neck. Caruncles may be featherless, or, have small scattered feathers.  In some species, they may form pendulous structures of [[erectile tissue]], such as the "[[snood (anatomy)|snood]]" of the [[domestic turkey]].&lt;ref name="Sharpe"&gt;{{cite book | title=Catalogue of the birds in the British Museum | publisher=British Natural History Museum Department of Zoology | author=Sharpe, Richard Bowdler | year=1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Word"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wordreference.com/definition/caruncle | title=Caruncle definition | publisher=Word Reference Dictionary | accessdate=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bull"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Birds Of America | publisher=Dover Publications |author1=Audubon, John James |author2=Amadon, Dean |author3=Bull, John L. | year=1967|oclc=555150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caruncles are sometimes [[Secondary sex characteristic|secondary sexual characteristics]], having a more intense color or even a different color, developing as the male reaches sexual maturity.

==Function==
Caruncles are also ornamental elements used by males to attract females to breeding.&lt;ref name="Burke"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMMjW6AuzHAC&amp;pg=PA702&amp;dq=Caruncles+attract+females+breeding#v=onepage&amp;q=Caruncles%20attract%20females%20breeding&amp;f=false | title=The Complete Burke's Backyard: The Ultimate Book of Fact Sheets | author=Burke, Don | pages=702| isbn=9781740457392 | year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having large caruncles or colorful bright ones indicates high levels of testosterone, that they are well-fed birds able to elude other predators thus showing the good quality of their genes.&lt;ref name="Springer"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Are large wattles related to particular MHC genotypes in the male pheasant? | journal=Genetica| volume=138| issue=6| pages=657–665| doi=10.1007/s10709-010-9440-5 | pmid=20145977|year = 2010|last1 = Baratti|first1 = Mariella| last2=Ammannati| first2=Martina| last3=Magnelli| first3=Claudia| last4=Massolo| first4=Alessandro| last5=Dessì-Fulgheri| first5=Francesco}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed that these organs are also associated with genes which encode resistance to disease.&lt;ref name="Springer"/&gt; It is believed that for birds living in tropical regions, the caruncles also play a role in thermoregulation, making the blood cool faster when flowing through them.&lt;ref name="Sora"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v113n02/p0310-p0318.pdf | title=Thermoregulatory Role of the Unfeathered Head and Neck in Male Wild Turkeys | publisher=Sora.unm.edu | author=Buchholz, Richard | year=1996 | pages=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkeys==
 [[File:Goulds Turkey with Snood.jpg|thumb|[[Wild turkey#Gould.27s wild turkey .28M. g. mexicana.29 .28Gould.2C 1856.29|Gould's wild turkey]] with non-erected snood and wattle.]]  In [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]], the term usually refers to small, bulbous, fleshy protuberances found on the head, neck and throat, with larger structures particularly at the bottom of the throat.  The wattle is a flap of skin hanging under the chin connecting the throat and head and the snood is a highly erectile appendage emanating from the forehead.  Both sexes of turkey possess caruncles, although they are more pronounced in the male. Usually they are pale, but when the male becomes excited or during courtship, the caruncles, wattle and snood all engorge with blood, become bright red or blue, and enlarge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpwmagazine.com/archive/2005/nov/skillbuilder/|title=Know your turkey parts|author=Graves, R.A.|year=2005|accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''beard'' (a tuft of modified brush-like feathers) also becomes erect.

==Muscovy ducks==
In the context of [[Muscovy duck]]s, caruncles refer to the red fleshy mask that surrounds the head of adult birds, particularly prominent in adult drakes (males).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpbaa.com/Muscovy_Ducks.html |title=Muscovy Ducks |author=Heritage Poultry Breeders Association of America |year=2013 |accessdate=April 20, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19818">'''Coitus reservatus''' (''[[Sexual intercourse|coitus]]'', "sexual intercourse, union" + ''reservatus'', "reserved, saved"),&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's ''Compact Latin Dictionary'', Dell Publishing Co. Inc., 1963&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''sexual continence''', is a form of sexual intercourse in which the penetrative partner does not attempt to [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] within the receptive partner, but instead attempts to remain at the [[Human sexual response cycle#Plateau phase|plateau phase]] of intercourse for as long as possible avoiding the seminal emission.

[[Alice Stockham]] coined the term ''karezza'', derived from the Italian word "carezza" meaning "caress", to describe coitus reservatus, but the idea was already in practice at the [[Oneida Community]]. [[Alan Watts]] believed, in error, that karezza was a Persian word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |title=Nature, Man and Woman |page=172 |year=1970 |publisher=Random House Inc. Vintage Books Edition |lccn=58-8266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of karezza is loosely akin to [[maithuna]] in [[Tantra|Hindu Tantra]] and [[Sahaja]] in Hindu [[Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswami |first=Ananda K.|title=The Dance of Shiva |page=124 |publisher=The Noonday Press Inc. |year=1957 |location=New York City |lccn=56-12296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of ejaculation is a key aspect of [[Taoist sexual practices]] (known as "cai Yin pu Yang" and "cai Yang pu Yin").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM|title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia: T|last=Pauly|first=Ira B.|date=2013-05-23|website=|publisher=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523194332/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM|archive-date=2013-05-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice of Karezza and Tantric (sexual) continence ==

Stockham writes, "... Karezza signifies 'to express affection in both words and action,' and while it fittingly denotes the union that is the outcome of deepest human affection, love's consummation, it is used technically throughout this work to designate a controlled sexual union." So that in practice, according to Stockham, it is more than just self-control, but mutual control where the penetrative partner helps the receptive partner and vice versa. According to Stockham this is the key to overcoming many difficulties encountered in trying to control sexual expression on an individual basis.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=22}}
Stockham's contribution was to apply this same philosophy of [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]] to women as much as to men. A form of [[birth control]], the technique also prolongs sexual pleasure to the point of achieving mystical ecstasy, according to [[John William Lloyd|J. William Lloyd]], a practitioner of Karezza, whose own experience of [[cosmic consciousness]] appears in  ''Cosmic Consciousness'', a book written  by the Canadian psychiatrist [[Richard Maurice Bucke|Richard M. Bucke]], a friend of the American poet [[Walt Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;Bucke, Richard Maurice, M. D. ''Cosmic Consciousness'', p. 284, Citadel Press, 1961, {{ISBN|0-8065-0211-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this practice,  orgasm is separated from ejaculation, making possible enjoyment of the pleasure of sexual intercourse without experiencing seminal ejaculation, while still experiencing orgasm.

Some would have the principles of karezza applied to masturbation, whereby a person attempts to delay orgasm as long as possible to prolong pleasure in a process known as "orgasmic brinkmanship", "surfing", or "edging" but this is different from the heterosexual practice of "karezza".&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Marie Griffith ''Born Again Bodies'', p. 92, [[University of California Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-520-24240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin literature, this is known as ''coitus sine ejaculatione seminis''.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, J. William ''The Karezza Method'' Health Research, 1964, Mokelumne Hill, California&lt;/ref&gt;

One purpose of karezza is the maintenance, and indeed, intensification of desire and enjoyment of sexual pleasure within the context of  relationships. According to Stockham, it takes from two weeks to a month for the body to recover from ejaculation ... "Unless procreation is desired, let the final propagative orgasm be entirely avoided".{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=25}} Stockham advocated that the 'honeymoon period' of a relationship could be maintained in perpetuity by limiting the frequency of ejaculations or preferably avoiding them entirely.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=15}}

Kalman Andras Oszlar writes, "Inasmuch as sexual togetherness is not limited into the physical world and does not mean quick wasting of sexual energies, by this we give free way to higher dimensions in the relationship." Affected by this we may be gotten into the state of flow experience (abbreviated as flow) and in the course of this the couple charges up with energy, while – with focused attention (Dharana) – the couple is submerging in which they are having pleasure. This state of mind is connected with the achieved beneficial effects by tantric restraint and transformation. At first the definition of positive philosophy was defined by [[Mihály Csíkszentmihályi]] and since then it is referred beyond the professional line. According to the professor the flow-experience is an entirely focused and a motivationally intensified experience where in the course of this people can entirely focus and properly command their feelings for the best performance or learning.

===General===
There is a slight difference between karezza and coitus reservatus.  In coitus reservatus, unlike karezza, a woman can enjoy a prolonged orgasm while a man exercises self-control; similarly, in the context of two male sexual partners, the receptive partner can enjoy the stimulation of his prostate for a longer period of time than he would otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Rudolf Von Urban, M. D. ''Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness'', Dial Press, 1949  ISBN B001AA3TWA&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[coitus interruptus]], coitus reservatus is not a reliable form of preventing a [[sexually transmitted disease]], as the penis leaks [[pre-ejaculate]] prior to ejaculation, which may contain all of the same infectious viral particles and bacteria as the actual [[semen]]. Although studies have not found sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; the method is also unreliable for [[contraception]] because of the difficulty of controlling ejaculation beyond the point of no return in over-reaching the orgasm. Additionally, if it follows an earlier orgasm, it is possible for pre-ejaculate fluid to pick up sperm from a previous ejaculation, leading to pregnancy even when performed correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Withdrawal Method |work=Planned Parenthood |date=March 2004 | url =http://www.plannedparenthood.com/health-topics/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method-4218.htm |accessdate=2008-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on ''coitus reservatus''===
The [[Oneida Community]], founded in the 19th century by [[John Humphrey Noyes]], experimented with coitus reservatus which was then called '''male continence''' in a religiously [[Christian]] [[communalism|communalist]] environment. The experiment lasted for about a quarter of a century and then Noyes went on to create Oneida silverware and establish the Oneida Silver Co. that grew into [[Oneida Limited]].{{sfn |Ellis |1910 |p=553}}  Noyes identified three functions of the sexual organs: the urinary, the propagative and the amative. Noyes believed in the separation of the amative from the propagative, and he put amative sexual intercourse on the same footing with other ordinary forms of social interchange. Sexual intercourse as Noyes defines it is the insertion of the penis into the vagina; ejaculation is not a requirement for sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Noyes 1872"&gt;{{cite book |title=Male continence |website=Syracuse University Library - Department of Special Collections - Oneida Community Collection |authorlink=John Humphrey Noyes |first=John Humphrey |last=Noyes |archiveurl=https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:2577486$1i |archivedate=2017-11-03 |deadurl=no |year=1877 |orig-year=1872 |location=Oneida, NY |publisher=Office of the American Socialist |oclc=786280936 |url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/m/MaleContinence-51k/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English novelist [[Aldous Huxley]], in his last novel ''Island'' wrote that Maithuna, the Yoga of Love is... "the same as what [[Roman Catholicism]] means by ''coitus reservatus''."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous ''Island, Harper &amp; Row, 1962''&lt;/ref&gt; Getting to the point by discussing ''coitus reservatus'', Alan W. Watts in ''Nature, Man and Woman'' notes: "...I would like to see someone make a case for the idea that the [[Apostles]] really did hand down an inner tradition to the Church, and that through all these centuries the Church has managed to guard it from the public eye. If so, it has remained far more secret and [[esotericism|"esoteric"]] than in any of the other great spiritual traditions of the world, so much so that its existence is highly doubtful..."&lt;ref&gt;"Watts, Alan W. ''Nature, Man and Woman, Ch 7, Pantheon Books Inc. 1958''&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh writer [[Norman Lewis (author)|Norman Lewis]], in his celebrated account of life in [[Naples]] in 1944, claimed that [[Saint Roch|San Rocco]] was the [[patron saint]] of coitus reservatus:  "I recommended him to drink -- as the locals did -- [[Marsala wine|marsala]] with the yolk of eggs stirred into it, and to wear a medal of San Rocco, patron of coitus reservatus, which could be had in any religious-supplies shop".&lt;ref name="Lewis 2005 p. "&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Norman |title=Naples '44 : a World War II diary of occupied Italy |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |publication-place=New York |year=2005 |isbn=9781480433250 |oclc=854852494 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/naples-44-a-world-war-ii-diary-of-occupied-italy/oclc/854852494/viewport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coitus reservatus is said by some authors to be a part of the teachings of the Catholic Church regarding sexual intercourse and to be a permitted form of intercourse but was subject to the same arguments as coitus interruptus.&lt;ref name="Bullough 2001 p. "&gt;{{cite book |last=Bullough |first=Vern |title=Encyclopedia of birth control |publisher=ABC-CLIO |publication-place=Santa Barbara, Calif |year=2001 |isbn=9781576075333 |page= |oclc=50174689}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]], the Catholic Church condemned this practice, under the Latin term "amplexus reservatus" (reserved embrace).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Denzinger |first=Heinrich|title=Enchiridion Symbolorum |publisher=Ignatius Press |publication-place=San Francisco, Calif |year=2012 |isbn=9780898707465 |page=810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Havelock Ellis]] writes: "''Coitus Reservatus'', – in which intercourse is maintained even for very long periods, during which a woman may have orgasm several times while the penetrative partner succeeds in holding back orgasm, – so far from being injurious to a woman, is probably the form of coitus which gives her the maximum gratification and relief".{{sfn |Ellis |1910 |p=552}}

== Rosicrucians ==
The [[AMORC]] [[Rosicrucians]] declare openly that they do not engage in sexual practices of an occult nature. This has been so since their First Imperator [[H. Spencer Lewis]], Ph. D. made it public knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, H. Spencer ''Rosicrucian Manual'', p. 5, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Their rival organization [[Fraternitas Rosae Crucis]] led by Dr. [[R. Swinburne Clymer]] engages in sexual practices for the sake of race regeneration. Dr. Clymer is completely opposed to the practice of Karezza or ''coitus reservatus'' and advocates instead a form of sex intercourse in which the couple experiences the orgasm at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, R. Swinburne MD, ''The Mystery of Sex and Race Regeneration'', p. 223, The Philosophical Publishing Co., 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary of the [[FUDOSI]] instead heartily approves the practice of Karezza to establish harmony in the family as well as in the world by preventing the waste and misuse of sex energy.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Lanval, editor, ''Lumière et Liberté'', Organe Officiel de la Ligue Belge de Propagande Héliophile, Octobre-Novembre 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Arnold Krumm-Heller]] established the [[Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua]] (FRA), a Rosicrucian school in Germany with branches in South America, having the following formula of sexual conduct: "Immissio Membri Virile In Vaginae Sine Ejaculatio Seminis" (Introduce the penis in the vagina without ejaculating the semen). [[Samael Aun Weor]] experimented with that formula and developed the doctrine of ''[[The Perfect Matrimony]]''.

== "Dianism" in Sex Magick == 
{{main|Dianism}}
Inspired by [[Ida Craddock]]'s work Heavenly Bridegrooms, American occultist [[C.F.

== Controversy ==

[[Alice Bunker Stockham|Alice Stockham]] was taken to court and forced to give up teaching the practice of Karezza in the [[United States]]. Like many other sex reformers, Dr. Stockham was arrested by [[Anthony Comstock]].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Deveney ''Paschal B.

'''Community Greens''', sometimes referred to as ''backyard commons'', ''urban [[Common lands|common]]s'', or [[pocket neighborhood]]s, are shared open green spaces on the inside of city blocks, created either when residents merge backyard space or reclaim underutilized urban land such as vacant lots and [[Alley|alleyway]]s. These shared spaces are communally used and managed only by the residents whose homes abut them. They are not a public park, a private backyard, or a community garden; however, they can function as all three.

==Community Greens==
Community Greens is an organization concerned with the development of shared green spaces in residential neighborhoods in American cities. These green spaces are community greens.  The Community Greens movement believes that such an approach presents the best opportunity to add usable green space to American cities, by converting under utilized backyards and dysfunctional alleys into functional and beautiful shared green spaces that are owned, managed, and enjoyed by the people who live around them.

This has led communities in numerous American cities, including Boston, Sacramento, Baltimore, New York, and San Francisco, taking down their backyard fences, to create backyard commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/existinggreens.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618112110/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/existinggreens.htm |archivedate=2009-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community Greens are multi-functional spaces for gardening, recreation, and leisure which are designed to provide social, economic, and environmental benefits to urban residents. The creation of  backyard commons can lead to an increased interaction with neighbors throughout the planning and implementation process, which may result in a stronger overall sense of community. Other possible social benefits that are claimed include decreased crime, from having more eyes on the street, and safe places where children can play and adults relax. Community Greens, like other types of urban green spaces, can significantly improve the ecological functioning of urban habitats. Vegetation and permeable pavement can slow storm water runoff and increase groundwater, which in turn can reduce pollutant flowing into nearby bodies of water during a storm. Urban environments are often significantly warmer than outlying suburbs, mostly due to the prevalence of  heat retentive concrete surfaces. City trees can mitigate this effect through shading, etc..&lt;ref&gt;Rosenfeld, AH, and Romm, JJ. (Feb/Mar97 ) “Painting the town white-and green.”''MIT's Technology Review''. 100(2):52-59.&lt;/ref&gt; The taking down  of backyards fences transforms fragmented habitats to connected corridors for urban wildlife. Furthermore because city dwellers recognize value in green space, often simply from an aesthetic standpoint, and this may be reflected through increased property values.&lt;ref&gt;Been, V.

==The beginnings in Maryland==
* Community Greens was founded as an offshoot of Ashoka, by Ashoka founder [[Bill Drayton]] in 2001.
* Spearheaded a state wide legislature in [[Maryland]], which changed the City Charter which allows the city to lease and gate alleys to homeowners.
* Started the Alley Gating and Alley Greening pilot project in [[Baltimore]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Alley greening [http://archive.baltimorecity.gov/Government/AgenciesDepartments/Transportation/Divisions/AlleyGatingGreeningProgram.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local ordinance passed in the City of Baltimore in 2007.
* As of 2009, there are 3 completely gated and greened alleys in Baltimore and over 70 applications from interested neighborhoods.

===Baltimore: The pilot project===
In 2002, a group of residents from the [[Patterson Park]] neighborhood approached the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation (CDC) looking for a way to improve the dirty, crime-ridden alley that ran behind their homes. Simultaneously, Community Greens also approached the Patterson Park CDC looking for an alley they could use as a pilot project in Baltimore, and these two groups were put into contact. The Luzerne-Glover block was granted a temporary permit from the city to gate their alleyway, despite the fact that it was not yet legal to gate a right-of-way. Community Greens, the Patterson Park CDC, the Patterson Park Neighborhood Association and the Luzurne‐Glover block group turned to University of Maryland law professor Barbara Bezdek, who enlisted the help of her law students, who researched existing laws and current uses of Baltimore alleyways.

[[File:Luzerne and Chandlers Yard Before.jpg|thumb|alt=Luzerne alleyway before gating and greening|The Luzerne-Glover Block alley before gating and greening]]

Looking for a permanent solution, these groups aligned themselves with the Mayor's Department of Neighborhoods and took their case to Annapolis. Maryland Delegate [[Peter A. Hammen]] sponsored House Bill 1533 to amend the Baltimore City Charter, allowing the City to close alleyways and lease them to interested parties. The Luzerne-Glover group testified before the Environmental Committee of the state legislature and House Bill 1533 passed in 2004. Community Greens then worked with law firm [[Hogan &amp; Hartson]], in collaboration with Barbara Bezdek, to draft a city alley gating and leasing ordinance, which was then submitted to the City of Baltimore.

In April 2007, the [[Baltimore City Council]] under the leadership of newly elected Mayor [[Shelia Dixon]], passed the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance, enabling Baltimore residents to legally gate and green the alleys behind their homes, contingent on a requirement that 80% of the homeowners on the alley submit consent forms and 100% of property owners to approve projects that impede traffic flow. Projects requiring 100% consent include removal of existing concrete and installation of permeable pavement and large tree plantings; beautification and smaller greening projects that do not impede traffic only require 80% approval.

Interested communities need approval from several Baltimore City Departments, including Solid Waste, Transportation, Fire, and Police to ensure that proposed alley projects meet the necessary infrastructural conditions. Once initial approval is received, residents submit an application to the Department of Public Works, which includes the necessary consent forms from homeowners and a signed affidavit stating that attempts were made to obtain approval from all homeowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.baltimore.md.us/government/dpw/alleyGating.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525041536/http://www.ci.baltimore.md.us/government/dpw/alleyGating.php |archivedate=2009-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Luzerne Glover neighborhood now has their green alleyway, and is the first community in Baltimore to use the Gating and Greening Alleys ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/alleyreport_final_reduced.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090225084428/http://college.usc.edu/geography/ESPE/documents/alleyreport_final_reduced.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, seven Baltimore communities have successfully completed this process and have created eight useful Community Greens from the underutilized alleyways in their backyards.

==Other existing greens==

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090628111701/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/montgomerypark/Montgomery%20Park.htm Montgomery Park - Boston, Massachusetts]===
'''Montgomery Park''' is a third of an acre common space shared by 85 households in Boston's South End neighborhood. From the time the neighborhood was first developed in the 1860s through the 1970s, the park was separated from the residents' backyards by an alley and fence. In more recent years, residents began to connect the park to their individual yards by replacing the alley separating their private backyards from the park with a narrower brick walkway and tearing down backyard fences. Additionally, residents have moved garbage collection to the front street and convinced utility companies to bury service lines. Residents now enjoy greater access to the shared Community Green, and use it for gardening and recreation.

Ten residential buildings share five courtyards, accessible from a small alleyway. Homes have front and back patios in addition to the shared courtyards, and neighbors have the opportunity to enjoy this shared outdoor space and experience a heightened sense of community. The inward-facing position of these patios allows parents to keep a watchful eye on children playing in the courtyard.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619124249/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/chandlersyard/chandlersyard.htm Chandlers Yard - Baltimore, Maryland]===
Located in the Federal Hill neighborhood of downtown Baltimore and hidden behind eleven narrow rowhouses, '''Chandler's Yard''' is a tree-shaded courtyard that was carved out of the backyards of the surrounding homes by developer Bill Struever who wanted to make living on the block more attractive to potential buyers. Struever convinced some of the property owners in this block to give up part of their backyards for this shared courtyard and pay a small construction fee. The result is a beautiful shared space for these residents, who enjoy a heightened sense of security and increased property values.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090218163042/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/villagehomes/villagehomes.htm Village Homes - Davis, California]===
The '''Village Homes''' development is situated on a sixty-acre parcel in suburban Davis, California. While home lots are smaller than the average for Davis, clusters of eight homes share common green spaces accessible from private backyards. In addition to these courtyards, Village Homes residents share two large parks, two vineyards, and numerous small orchards and community gardens. Gardens are irrigated by naturally-flowing creeks, which also serve as natural filters that eliminate the need for an expensive storm-water sewer system. Residents enjoy environmental and aesthetic benefits from their shared spaces, and the increased sense of community is evident; Village Homes residents on average know 40 neighbors, compared to an average of 17 acquaintances reported in a nearby traditional suburban development.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090630004718/http://www.communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/jacksonheights/jacksonheights.htm Jackson Heights - Queens, New York]===
For nearly nine decades, the historic neighborhood of '''Jackson Heights''' in Queens has maintained its fourteen block-long shared interior courtyards, and is considered to be the first "garden apartments" constructed in the United States. These spaces have helped to sustain the blocks' distinctive appeal since their development in the early decades of the last century. Over the years, Jackson Heights residents fought to hold on to their gardens and green spaces in the midst of a city where high property values create an intense pressure to develop any available open space.  The preservation of these shared spaces has increased both community pride and residential property values; if these inner courtyards had been developed, Jackson Heights property values would have dropped by one-third. In 1993, Jackson Heights was officially declared a historic district by the NYC Landmark Preservation Commission, furthering sense of place for this community.

===[http://www.communitygreens.org/st-francis-square St. Francis Square - San Francisco, California]===
A cooperative apartment community, '''St. Francis Square''' consists of 299 apartments wrapped around three shared, open spaces. These community greens are full of gardens, basketball courts, playgrounds, and quiet places to relax.  St. Francis Square was established as a limited equity co-operative apartment, although it converted to market rate ownership in 2004.

===[https://web.archive.org/web/20090619124254/http://communitygreens.org/ExistingGreens/hopecommunity/hope.htm The Hope Community - Minneapolis, MN]===
Fifteen years ago, this community was situated in an area of Minneapolis plagued by urban flight and crime. Instrumental to the rehabilitation and renovation of this neighborhood is a local community development corporation, [http://www.hope-community.org/ Hope Community, Inc]. In the late 1980s, residents were selling their properties for one dollar because they had lost all value; this is when the Hope Community began purchasing houses in the hopes of developing affordable rental units clustered together on a single block. Today, nine rehabilitated houses abut community areas, a playground, and gardens. Property values are steadily increasing and the community itself is stabilizing. By following principles of Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) and creating defensible space, '''the Hope Community''' has created a sense of shared ownership and community in a troubled urban area.

==Green alleys==
Something similar has taken place in various cities in North America, involving the [[greening]] of [[back lane]]s or [[alley]]s. This includes [[Chicago]],&lt;ref name=chicago /&gt; [[Seattle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/docs/pmp/greenalleyhandbook_chicago.pdf "The Chicago Green Alley Handbook"] on the City of Seattle website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Los Angeles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpl.org/green-alleys "Green Alleys"] on the [[Trust for Public Land]] website&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington, D.C.]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ddot.dc.gov/publication/ddot-green-alley-project-fact-sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Montréal]], Canada, who have started to reclaim their alleys from garbage and crime by [[greening]] the service lanes, or back ways, that run behind some houses.&lt;ref name=dc&gt;[http://dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Projects+and+Planning/Environment/Green+Alley+Projects "Green Alley Projects"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104000808/http://dc.gov/DC/DDOT/Projects%2Band%2BPlanning/Environment/Green%2BAlley%2BProjects |date=January 4, 2014 }} on the District of Columbia Department of Transportation website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://integratedalleys.tumblr.com/about "About Us"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104095801/http://integratedalleys.tumblr.com/about |date=January 4, 2014 }} on the ''Integrated Alleys'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Chicago]]''', [[Illinois]] has about {{convert|1900|mi|km}} of alleyways.&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;[http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/provdrs/street/svcs/green_alleys.html "Service: Green Alleys"] on the City of Chicago website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Chicago Department of Transportation]] started converting conventional alleys which were paved with [[asphalt]] into so called Green Alleys. This program, called the Green Alley Program, is supposed to enable easier water runoff, as the alleyways in [[Chicago]] are not connected to the sewer system. With this program, the water will be able to seep through semi-permeable [[concrete]] or [[asphalt]] in which a colony of fungi and bacteria will establish itself. The bacteria will help breakup oils before the water is absorbed into the ground. The lighter color of the pavement will also reflect more light, making the area next to the alley cooler.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140103190427/http://www.screamtobegreen.com/2007/11/chicago-alleys-to-go-green/ "Chicago Alleys to Go Green"] on the ''Scream to be Green'' website&lt;/ref&gt; The greening of such alleys or laneways can also involve the planting of native plants to further absorb rain water and moderate temperature.

From a pure engineering perspective there is no difference between designing a regular sewage system and a condominial one. However, bureaucratically a condominial system includes the participation of the individuals and owners who will be served and can often result in lower costs due to shorter runs of piping.&lt;ref name="Caesb-DF" /&gt; This is achieved by local concentration of sewage from a single "housing block". Thus a number of dwellings are grouped into a "block" known as a condominium. The condominium may share no other aspects of ownership or relation except geographic proximity. In addition, individuals and owners may share a role in the maintenance of the sewers at the block level.&lt;ref name=TheHindu/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5262">The '''daily urban system (DUS)''' refers to the area around a city, in which daily commuting occurs. It is a means for defining an [[urban area|urban]] region by including the areas from which individuals commute. Daily Urban System is a concept first introduced by American geographer, Berry, and British geographer, Hall. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halás, Marián|first=and Zuskáčová, Veronika|date=April 23, 2017|title="Travelling to Services in the Daily Urban System of Olomouc."|url=http://apcz.umk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/BGSS/article/viewFile/bog-2013-0009/818|journal=Bulletin of Geography. Socio–economic Series.|volume=20|pages=23–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Orphan|date=June 2016}}

Daily urban system (DUS) mainly focusses on urban cities, where majority of the commuting flow take place. However, some case studies do look at the outskirts and suburban areas around specific urban cities that are being studied. The daily commuting includes both work and leisure, contributing to high density in the daily urban system. That results in slower the speed of transportation. The speed of transportation is about 16km/h at the central parts of urban cities, but speed may vary from place to place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denise Pumain|Pumain, Denise]]. "Scaling Laws and Urban Systems" (PDF). Santa Fe Institute. Retrieved April 23, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Urban sprawl]] is the possible outcome of an expansion of the daily urban system. Therefore, it includes multiple local governments, economies, and demographics. The researchers that study daily urban system (DUS) are basically focusing on the [[transportation planning]]. Some are interested in micro analysis of an urban area per se, some carry out macro analysis of a region that is made up of several urban cities. 

The difference between an agglomeration of an urban area and the daily urban system is that an agglomeration is a multivariate means of combining townships, counties, and other defined areas. It looks at shared economic relationships and other factors. Daily urban system, on the other hand, only attempts to show how far away people who commute into a city are living. It shows how much sprawl has occurred. That is, it shows how people are living unnecessarily far away from where they commute to everyday due to differences in conditions between the regions. 

== Literature Review ==

=== Olomouc ===
A study in Olomouc research on the traveling distance among locations such as schools, hospitals, retail stores, and culture and sports centers of the region, and the towns in the hinterland of Olomouc too. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The findings were different for the region and towns. The towns had shown improvement in traveling distance for commercial services, such as pharmacies and banking services. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There were groceries and retail shops moving to large commercial centers too, cutting down traveling distance, which people were able to shop at the malls without having to travel much.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the study found little changes region wise, especially in health care and education sectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Commute for schools and health care institutions had remained stable.  

===Randstad===
In this article, the researchers were looking at the daily urban systems within Randstad to determine if the megalopolis is considered a network city. Commute within Randstad remained loose despite the rising proportions of population commuting to work over a decade (1992 to 2002).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ritsema Van Eck, Snellen|first=Jan, Daniëlle|date=2006|title=Is the Randstad a City Network? Evidence From Commuting Patterns|url=https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/athena/course/11/11.951/oldstuff/albacete/Other_Documents/Europe%20Transport%20Conference/planning_for_sustainab/is_the_randstad_a_1428.pdf|journal=Association for European Transport|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many residents from the suburban areas were still commuting to work at the urban areas - large daily urban system - every day after ten years due to low job growth. Randstad was not considered as a network city because of its negative commuting balance, where large proportion of residents had to commute to large daily urban system for work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Paris ===
Paris's central urban population is 2,125,246.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It's agglomerated population is 9,644,507.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That's a big difference. Roughly 7 million people live outside of Paris proper, but are easily within the greater Parisian area. Paris's daily urban system has a population of 11,174,743.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That's 1.5 million people living outside of what can (at the most generous) be called Paris, and yet are commuting there every day. 10% of the city lives far enough away that they cannot really say they 'live outside of Paris,' but commute there daily.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pumain|first=Denise|title=Scaling Laws and Urban Systems|url=http://www.santafe.edu/media/workingpapers/04-02-002.pdf|publisher=[[Santa Fe Institute]]|accessdate=February 28, 2014|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''drainage basin''' is any area of land where [[precipitation]] collects and drains off into a common outlet, such as into a [[river]], [[bay]], or other [[body of water]]. The drainage basin includes all the [[surface water]] from [[surface runoff|rain runoff]], [[snowmelt]], and nearby streams that run downslope towards the shared outlet, as well as the [[groundwater]] underneath the earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/glossary/a_d/drainage_basin.html |title=drainage basin |work=The Physical Environment |publisher=University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040321033433/http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/glossary/a_d/drainage_basin.html|archivedate=March 21, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drainage basins connect into other drainage basins at lower elevations in a [[Strahler number|hierarchical pattern]], with smaller '''sub-drainage basins''', which in turn drain into another common outlet.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;{{cite web |author= |year= |url=http://www.wr.udel.edu/cb/whatwhycare.html |title=What is a watershed and why should I care? |publisher=university of delaware |accessdate=2008-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used interchangeably with ''drainage basin'' are '''catchment area''', '''catchment basin''', '''drainage area''', '''river basin''', and '''water basin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambert|first=David|authorlink=|title=The Field Guide to Geology|publisher=Checkmark Books|series=|year=1998| pages=130–13|doi=|isbn=0-8160-3823-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[North America]], the term '''''watershed''''' is commonly used to mean a drainage basin, though in other English-speaking countries, it is used only in its original sense, that of a [[drainage divide]].

In a closed drainage basin, or [[endorheic basin]], the water converges to a single point inside the basin, known as a [[sink (geography)|sink]], which may be a permanent lake, a [[dry lake]], or a point where surface water is [[Losing stream|lost underground]].&lt;ref name=virginia&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/stormwater_management/hu.shtml |title= Hydrologic Unit Geography |publisher= Virginia Department of Conservation &amp; Recreation |accessdate= 21 November 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20121214100316/http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/stormwater_management/hu.shtml |archivedate= 14 December 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The drainage basin acts as a [[funnel]] by collecting all the water within the area covered by the basin and channelling it to a single point. Each drainage basin is separated topographically from adjacent basins by a perimeter, the [[drainage divide]], making up a succession of higher geographical features (such as a [[ridge]], [[hill]] or [[mountain]]s) forming a barrier.

Drainage basins are similar but not identical to [[Hydrological code|hydrologic units]], which are drainage areas delineated so as to nest into a multi-level hierarchical [[drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage system]]. Hydrologic units are defined to allow multiple inlets, outlets, or sinks. In a strict sense, all drainage basins are hydrologic units but not all hydrologic units are drainage basins.&lt;ref name=virginia/&gt;

=== Map ===
[[File:Ocean drainage.png|frameless|center|upright=3.1|Major [[continental divide]]s, showing drainage into the major oceans and seas of the world.]]
&lt;center&gt;Drainage basins of the principal oceans and seas of the world. Grey areas are [[endorheic basin]]s that do not drain to the oceans.&lt;/center&gt;

=== Ocean basins ===
The following is a list of the major ocean basins:
* About 48.7% of the world's land drains to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} In [[North America]], surface water drains to the Atlantic via the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and [[Great Lakes]] basins, the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] of the United States, the [[Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]], and most of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Nearly all of [[South America]] east of the [[Andes]] also drains to the Atlantic, as does most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] and the greatest portion of western [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], as well as [[Western Sahara]] and part of [[Morocco]]. The two major [[Mediterranean sea (oceanography)|mediterranean seas]] of the world also flow to the Atlantic:
** The [[Caribbean Sea]] and [[Gulf of Mexico]] basin includes most of the U.S. interior between the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] and [[Rocky Mountains]], a small part of the Canadian provinces of [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]], eastern [[Central America]], the islands of the Caribbean and the Gulf, and a small part of northern South America.
** The [[Mediterranean Sea]] basin includes much of [[North Africa]], east-central [[Africa]] (through the [[Nile River]]), [[Southern Europe|Southern]], Central, and [[Eastern Europe]], [[Turkey]], and the coastal areas of [[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Syria]].
* The [[Arctic Ocean]] drains most of [[Western Canada|Western]] and [[Northern Canada]] east of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], northern [[Alaska]] and parts of [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Minnesota]], and [[Montana]] in the United States, the north shore of the [[Scandinavian peninsula]] in Europe, central and northern Russia, and parts of [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]] in [[Asia]], which totals to about 17% of the world's land.&lt;!-- Roughly (+/-0,7% error), computed. --~~~~ --&gt; 
* Just over 13% of the land in the world drains to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Its basin includes much of China, eastern and southeastern Russia, Japan, the [[Korean Peninsula]], most of Indochina, Indonesia and Malaysia, the Philippines, all of the [[Pacific Islands]], the northeast coast of [[Australia]], and Canada and the United States west of the Continental Divide (including most of Alaska), as well as western Central America and South America west of the Andes.
* The [[Indian Ocean]]'s drainage basin also comprises about 13% of Earth's land. It drains the eastern coast of Africa, the coasts of the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Indian subcontinent]], Burma, and most of Australia.
* The [[Southern Ocean]] drains [[Antarctica]]. Antarctica comprises approximately eight percent of the Earth's land.

=== Largest river basins ===
{{See also|List of drainage basins by area}}
The five largest river basins (by area), from largest to smallest, are the basins of the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] (7M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Congo River|Congo]] (4M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Nile River|Nile]] (3.4M km{{sup|2}}), the [[Río de la Plata]] (3.2M km{{sup|2}}), and the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] (3M km{{sup|2}}). The three rivers that drain the most water, from most to least, are the Amazon, [[Ganga River|Ganga]], and Congo rivers.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta Encyclopedia articles on [[Amazon River]], [[Congo River]], and [[Ganges]] Published by Microsoft in computers.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endorheic drainage basins ===
[[File:Uureg Nuur.jpg|thumb|[[Endorheic basin]] in [[Central Asia]]]]
{{Main article|Endorheic basin}}
[[Endorheic basin|Endorheic drainage basins]] are inland basins that do not drain to an ocean. Around 18% of all land drains to endorheic lakes or seas or sinks. The largest of these consists of much of the interior of [[Asia]], which drains into the [[Caspian Sea]], the [[Aral Sea]], and numerous smaller lakes. Other endorheic regions include the [[Great Basin]] in the United States, much of the [[Sahara Desert]], the drainage basin of the [[Okavango River]] ([[Kalahari Basin]]), highlands near the [[African Great Lakes]], the interiors of [[Australia]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], and parts in [[Mexico]] and the [[Andes]]. Some of these, such as the Great Basin, are not single drainage basins but collections of separate, adjacent closed basins.

In endorheic [[Bodies of water|bodies of standing water]] where evaporation is the primary means of water loss, the water is typically more saline than the oceans. An extreme example of this is the [[Dead Sea]].

== Importance of drainage basins ==

=== Geopolitical boundaries ===
Drainage basins have been historically important for determining territorial boundaries, particularly in regions where trade by water has been important. For example, the [[England|English]] crown gave the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] a monopoly on the [[fur trade]] in the entire [[Hudson Bay]] basin, an area called [[Rupert's Land]]. [[bioregionalism|Bioregional]] political organization today includes agreements of states (e.g., international [[treaty|treaties]] and, within the U.S.A., [[interstate compact]]s) or other political entities in a particular drainage basin to manage the body or bodies of water into which it drains. Examples of such interstate compacts are the [[Great Lakes Commission]] and the [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]].

=== Hydrology ===
[[File:Ohiorivermap.png|thumb|right|Drainage basin of the [[Ohio River]], part of the [[Mississippi River]] drainage basin]]

In [[hydrology]], the drainage basin is a logical unit of focus for studying the movement of water within the [[hydrological cycle]], because the majority of water that discharges from the basin outlet originated as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falling on the basin. A portion of the water that enters the [[groundwater]] system beneath the drainage basin may flow towards the outlet of another drainage basin because groundwater flow directions do not always match those of their overlying drainage network. Measurement of the discharge of water from a basin may be made by a [[stream gauge]] located at the basin's outlet.

Rain gauge data is used to measure total precipitation over a drainage basin, and there are different ways to interpret that data. If the gauges are many and evenly distributed over an area of uniform precipitation, using the [[arithmetic mean]] method will give good results. In the [[Thiessen polygon]] method, the drainage basin is divided into polygons with the rain gauge in the middle of each polygon assumed to be representative for the rainfall on the area of land included in its polygon. These polygons are made by drawing lines between gauges, then making perpendicular bisectors of those lines form the polygons. The [[isohyet]]al method involves contours of equal precipitation are drawn over the gauges on a map. Calculating the area between these curves and adding up the volume of water is time consuming.

[[Isochrone map]]s can be used to show the time taken for runoff water within a drainage basin to reach a lake, reservoir or outlet, assuming constant and uniform effective rainfall.&lt;ref name="hydrolearthsystsci bell 1998"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/2/265/1998/hess-2-265-1998.pdf | title=A grid-based distributed flood forecasting model for use with weather radar data: Part 1.

=== Geomorphology ===
Drainage basins are the principal hydrologic unit considered in [[fluvial]] [[geomorphology]]. A drainage basin is the source for water and [[sediment]] that moves from higher elevation through the river system to lower elevations as they reshape the channel forms.

=== Ecology ===
[[File:Mississippi River basin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Mississippi River]] drains the largest area of any [[United States|U.S.]] river, much of it [[agriculture|agricultural]] regions. Agricultural runoff and other water pollution that flows to the outlet is the cause of the [[dead zone (ecology)|hypoxic, or dead zone]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].]]

Drainage basins are important in [[ecology]]. As water flows over the ground and along rivers it can pick up nutrients, sediment, and [[water pollution|pollutants]]. With the water, they are transported towards the outlet of the basin, and can affect the ecological processes along the way as well as in the receiving water source.

Modern use of artificial fertilizers, containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, has affected the mouths of drainage basins. The minerals are carried by the drainage basin to the mouth, and may accumulate there, disturbing the natural mineral balance. This can cause [[eutrophication]] where plant growth is accelerated by the additional material.

=== Resource management ===
{{further information|Watershed management}}
Because drainage basins are coherent entities in a hydro-logical sense, it has become common to manage water resources on the basis of individual basins. In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]], governmental entities that perform this function are called "[[Watershed district (Minnesota)|watershed district]]s". In New Zealand, they are called catchment boards. Comparable community groups based in Ontario, Canada, are called [[Conservation authority (Canada)|conservation authorities]]. In North America, this function is referred to as "[[watershed management]]".
In [[Brazil]], the National Policy of Water Resources, regulated by Act n° 9.433 of 1997, establishes the drainage basin as the territorial division of Brazilian water management.

When a river basin crosses at least one political border, either a border within a nation or an international boundary, it is identified as a [[transboundary river]]. Management of such basins becomes the responsibility of the countries sharing it. [[Nile Basin Initiative]], [[OMVS]] for [[Senegal River]], [[Mekong River Commission]] are a few examples of arrangements involving management of shared river basins.

Management of shared drainage basins is also seen as a way to build lasting peaceful relationships among countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/inner-articles.php?id=310#.WA9Ia-V97GI|title=Articles|website=www.strategicforesight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catchment factors ==
The catchment is the most significant factor determining the amount or likelihood of [[flooding]].

Catchment factors are: [[topography]], shape, size, [[soil]] type, and [[land use]] (paved or [[roof]]ed areas). Catchment topography and shape determine the time taken for [[rain]] to reach the river, while catchment size, soil type, and development determine the amount of water to reach the river.

=== Topography ===
Generally, topography plays a big part in how fast runoff will reach a river. Rain that falls in steep [[mountain]]ous areas will reach the primary river in the drainage basin faster than flat or lightly sloping areas (e.g., &gt; 1% gradient).

=== Shape ===
Shape will contribute to the speed with which the runoff reaches a river. A long thin catchment will take longer to drain than a circular catchment.

=== Size ===
Size will help determine the amount of water reaching the river, as the larger the catchment the greater the potential for flooding. It is also determined on the basis of length and width of the drainage basin.

=== Soil type ===
Soil type will help determine how much water reaches the river. Certain soil types such as [[sand]]y soils are very free-draining, and rainfall on sandy soil is likely to be absorbed by the ground. However, soils containing [[clay]] can be almost impermeable and therefore rainfall on clay soils will run off and contribute to flood volumes. After prolonged rainfall even free-draining soils can become [[wikt:saturated|saturated]], meaning that any further rainfall will reach the river rather than being absorbed by the ground. If the surface is impermeable the precipitation will create surface run-off which will lead to higher risk of flooding; if the ground is permeable, the precipitation will infiltrate the soil.

=== Land use ===
Land use can contribute to the volume of water reaching the river, in a similar way to clay soils. For example, rainfall on roofs, [[sidewalk|pavements]], and [[road]]s will be collected by rivers with almost no absorption into the [[groundwater]].

'''Earthquake-resistant structures''' are [[structure]]s designed to protect buildings from  [[earthquake]]s. While no structure can be entirely immune to damage from earthquakes, the goal of [[Earthquake engineering|earthquake-resistant construction]] is to erect structures that fare better during seismic activity than their conventional counterparts.
According to [[building code]]s, earthquake-resistant structures are intended to withstand the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location.This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings for rare earthquakes while the loss of the functionality should be limited for more frequent ones.&lt;ref name=RecommendedLateralForce&gt;{{cite book|title= Recommended Lateral Force Requirements and Commentary|author=Seismology Committee|year=1999|publisher= Structural Engineers Association of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat earthquake destruction, the only method available to ancient architects was to build their landmark structures to last, often by making them excessively [[stiffness|stiff]] and [[strength of materials|strong]].

Currently, there are several design philosophies in earthquake engineering, making use of experimental results, computer simulations and observations from past earthquakes to offer the required performance for the seismic threat at the site of interest. These range from appropriately sizing the structure to be [[strength of materials|strong]] and [[ductility|ductile]] enough to survive the shaking with an acceptable damage, to equipping it with [[base isolation]] or using structural [[vibration control]] technologies to minimize any forces and deformations. While the former is the method typically applied in most earthquake-resistant structures, important facilities, landmarks and cultural heritage buildings use the more advanced (and expensive) techniques of isolation or control to survive strong shaking with minimal damage. Examples of such applications are the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] and the [[Acropolis Museum]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Trends and projects ==
Some of the new trends and/or projects in the field of earthquake engineering structures are presented.

===Building materials===
Based on studies in New Zealand, relating to [[Christchurch]] earthquakes, precast concrete designed and installed in accordance with modern codes performed well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.precastnz.org.nz/precast-concrete-and-seismic-issues/#damage Precast New Zealand Inc: Precast concrete and seismic issues]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute]], precast panel buildings had good durability during the earthquake in Armenia, compared to precast frame-panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eeri.org/1988/12/spitak/armenia_spitak_concrete/|title=Precast concrete panel building damage, comparing the performance of precast frame-panel (collapsed in foreground) and precast panel buildings (standing in background)|website=www.eeri.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthquake shelter===
One Japanese construction company has developed a six-foot cubical shelter, presented as an alternative to earthquake-proofing an entire building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4965895.html|title=Earthquake shelter with bed support and canopy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concurrent shake-table testing ===
Concurrent shake-table testing of two or more building models is a vivid, persuasive and effective way to validate [[earthquake engineering]] solutions experimentally.

Thus, two wooden houses built before adoption of the 1981 Japanese Building Code were moved to E-Defense&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allamericanpatriots.com/node/12697 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927091751/http://www.allamericanpatriots.com/node/12697 |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for testing (see both pictures aside). The left house was reinforced to enhance its seismic resistance, while the other one was not. These two models were set on E-Defense platform and tested simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kc652Zp5qWk&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=F297EF2ADDEAD86C&amp;index=182|title=Shaking Table Test on Conventional Wooden House (1)|last=neesit|date=17 November 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined vibration control solution===
[[File:Municipal Services Building-1.jpg|thumb|left|Close-up of abutment of [[w:en:Seismic retrofit|seismically retrofitted]] Municipal Services Building in [[Glendale, California]]]][[File:Municipal Services Building.jpg|thumb|[[w:en:Seismic retrofit|Seismically retrofitted]] Municipal Services Building in [[Glendale, California|Glendale]]]]Designed by architect Merrill W. Baird of Glendale, working in collaboration with [[Albert C. Martin, Sr.|A. C. Martin]] Architects of Los Angeles, the Municipal Services Building at 633 East Broadway, [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] was completed in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.glendale.ca.us/planning/MSB+EIR/AppendixB.pdf|title=Planning Division - City of Glendale, CA|website=www.ci.glendale.ca.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominently sited at the corner of East Broadway and Glendale Avenue, this civic building serves as a heraldic element of Glendale's civic center.

In October 2004 [[Architectural Resources Group]] (ARG) was contracted by [[Nabih Youssef]] &amp; Associates, Structural Engineers, to provide services regarding a historic resource assessment of the building due to a proposed seismic retrofit.

In 2008, the Municipal Services Building of the City of Glendale, California was [[w:en:seismic retrofit|seismically retrofitted]] using an innovative combined vibration control solution: the existing [[v:Elevated building foundation|elevated building foundation]] of the building was put on [[w:en:base isolation|high damping rubber bearings]].

===Steel plate walls system===
[[File:Pages from Kharrazi 0002.jpg|thumb|left|Coupled steel plate shear walls, [[Seattle]]]][[File:LA LiveTower05.jpg|thumb|The [[Ritz-Carlton]]/[[JW Marriott]] hotel building engaging the advanced steel plate shear walls system, [[Los Angeles]]]]A [[steel plate shear wall]] (SPSW) consists of steel infill plates bounded by a column-beam system. When such infill plates occupy each level within a framed bay of a structure, they constitute a SPSW system.&lt;ref&gt;Kharrazi, M.H.K., 2005, "Rational Method for Analysis and Design of Steel Plate Walls," Ph.D. Dissertation, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada,&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas most earthquake resistant construction methods are adapted from older systems, SPSW was invented entirely to withstand seismic activity.&lt;ref name=Reitherman&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|pages=356–357|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&amp;productid=154097877|archivedate=2012-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SPSW behavior is analogous to a vertical [[Plate (metal)|plate]] [[girder]] cantilevered from its base.  Similar to plate girders, the SPSW system optimizes component performance by taking advantage of the post-[[buckling]] behavior of the steel infill panels.

The Ritz-Carlton/JW Marriott hotel building, a part of the [[LA Live]] development in [[Los Angeles, California]], is the first building in Los Angeles that uses an advanced steel plate shear wall system to resist the lateral loads of strong earthquakes and winds.

On May 9, 2009, one unit (Unit 7) was restarted, after the [[seismic retrofit|seismic upgrades]]. The test run had to continue for 50 days. The plant had been completely shut down for almost 22 months following the earthquake.

===Seismic test of seven-story building===
A destructive earthquake struck a lone, wooden condominium in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.rpi.edu/update.do|title=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute News &amp; Events|date=12 October 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012030742/http://news.rpi.edu/update.do|archivedate=12 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment was webcast live on July 14, 2009 to yield insight on how to make wooden structures stronger and better able to withstand major earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/newsmedia/neeswood|title=Home - Standing Strong: 2009 NEESWood Capstone Test|website=www.nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Miki, Hyōgo|Miki]] shake at the Hyogo Earthquake Engineering Research Center is the capstone experiment of the four-year NEESWood project, which receives its primary support from the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]] Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) Program.

"NEESWood aims to develop a new seismic design philosophy that will provide the necessary mechanisms to safely increase the height of wood-frame structures in active seismic zones of the United States, as well as mitigate earthquake damage to low-rise wood-frame structures," said Rosowsky, Department of Civil Engineering at [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. This philosophy is based on the application of seismic damping systems for wooden buildings. The systems, which can be installed inside the walls of most wooden buildings, include strong metal [[:wikt:Frame|frame]], [[Timber framing|bracing]] and [[Tuned mass damper|damper]]s filled with [[viscous]] fluid.

===Superframe earthquake proof structure===
The proposed system is composed of core walls, hat beams incorporated into the top level,  outer columns and viscous dampers vertically installed between the tips of the hat beams and the outer columns. During an earthquake, the hat beams and outer columns act as outriggers and reduce the overturning moment in the core, and the installed dampers also reduce the moment and the lateral deflection of the structure. This innovative system can eliminate inner beams and inner columns on each floor, and thereby provide buildings  with  column-free  floor  space  even  in  highly  seismic  regions.&lt;ref&gt;"A Survey on concepts of design and executing of Superframe RC Earthquake proof Structures" (2016) by Kiarash Khodabakhshi {{ISBN|9783668208704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/wcee/article/0744.pdf | title=Seismic Design of a Super Frame | publisher=Kajima Corporation | accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="76611">'''Embodied cognition''' is the theory that many features of [[cognition]], whether human or otherwise, are shaped by aspects of the entire body of the organism. The features of cognition include high level mental constructs (such as [[concept]]s and [[Categorization|categories]]) and performance on various cognitive tasks (such as reasoning or judgment). The aspects of the body include the [[motor system]], the [[perceptual system]], bodily interactions with the environment ([[situated]]ness) and the assumptions about the world that are built into the structure of the organism.

The embodied mind thesis challenges other theories, such as [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], [[computationalism]], and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian dualism]].&lt;ref name=WilsonRA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Varela|Thompson|Rosch|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is closely related to the [[extended mind thesis]], [[situated cognition]] and [[enactivism]]. The modern version depends on insights drawn from recent research in [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[cognitive science]], [[Cognitive model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[robotics]], [[animal cognition]], [[plant cognition]] and [[neurobiology]].

==Embodiment thesis==
In [[philosophy]], embodied cognition holds that an agent's [[cognition]] is strongly influenced by aspects of an agent's body beyond the brain itself.&lt;ref name=WilsonRA&gt;
{{cite web |author1=Wilson, Robert A.  |author2=Foglia, Lucia |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N. Zalta |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/embodied-cognition/  |date=July 25, 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In their proposal for an [[Enactivism|enactive approach]] to cognition Varela ''et al.'' defined "embodied":&lt;ref name=VarelaF&gt;
{{cite book |title=The embodied mind: Cognitive science and human experience |publisher=MIT Press |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY4RoH2z5DoC&amp;pg=PA172 |isbn=978-0262720212 |edition=Paperback 1992 |author1=Eleanor Rosch |author2=Evan Thompson |author3=Francisco J. Varela }}
&lt;/ref&gt;
:"By using the term ''embodied'' we mean to highlight two points: first that cognition depends upon the kinds of experience that come from having a body with various sensorimotor capacities, and second, that these individual sensorimotor capacities are themselves embedded in a more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context."
:::—  Eleanor Rosch, Evan Thompson, Francisco J. Varela: ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience'' pages 172–173

The Varela enactive definition is broad enough to overlap the views of [[extended cognition]] and [[situated cognition]], and indeed, these ideas are not always carefully separated.

Some authors explain the dependence of cognition upon the body and its environmental interactions by saying cognition in real biological systems is not an end in itself but is constrained by the system's goals and capacities. However, they argue, such constraints do not mean cognition is set by adaptive behavior (or [[autopoiesis]]) alone, but cognition requires “''some'' kind of information processing...the transformation or communication of incoming information”, the acquiring of which involves "exploration and modification of the environment".&lt;ref name= Milkowski&gt;
{{cite book |title=Explaining the Computational Mind |author= Marcin Milkowski |page=4 |isbn=9780262018869 |year=2013 |publisher=MIT Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxH7eOEmlC4C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=%22transformation+or+communication+of+incoming+information%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BRvuVMa3D4urogSNo4CoBA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22transformation%20or%20communication%20of%20incoming%20information%22&amp;f=false}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
:"It would be a mistake, however, to suppose that cognition consists simply of building maximally accurate representations of input information...the gaining of knowledge is a stepping stone to achieving the more immediate goal of guiding behavior in response to the system's changing surroundings."
:::— Marcin Miłkowski: ''Explaining the Computational Mind'', p. 4

The separation of embodied cognition from [[extended cognition]] and [[situated cognition]] can be based upon the ''embodiment thesis'', a narrower view of embodiment than that of Varela ''et al.'' or that of Dawson:&lt;ref name=WilsonRA/&gt;
:'''''Embodiment thesis:''''' Many features of cognition are embodied in that they are deeply dependent upon characteristics of the physical body of an agent, such that the agent's beyond-the-brain body plays a significant causal role, or a physically constitutive role, in that agent's cognitive processing. 
:::—RA Wilson and L Foglia,  ''Embodied Cognition'' in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy

This thesis omits direct mention of some aspects of the "more encompassing biological, psychological and cultural context" included by Varela ''et al.'' The [[Extended mind thesis|''&lt;u&gt;Extended&lt;/u&gt;'' mind thesis]], in contrast with the &lt;u&gt;''Embodiment''&lt;/u&gt; thesis, limits cognitive processing neither to the brain nor even to the body, but extends it outward into the agent's world.&lt;ref name=WilsonRA/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChalmersD&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''&lt;u&gt;Situated&lt;/u&gt;'' cognition emphasizes that this extension is not just a matter of including resources outside the head, but stresses the role of probing and modifying interaction with the agent's world.&lt;ref name=ClarkA&gt;

== Philosophical background ==

In his ''[[Universal Natural History and Theory of Heaven]]'' (1755).&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], ''Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens'', p.367; translated by Stephen Palmquist in [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp2 Kant's Critical Religion] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000), p.320.&lt;/ref&gt; philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] advocated a view of the [[mind–body problem]] and the [[subject–object problem]] with parallels to the embodied view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Andrew Carpenter |title= Kant on the embodied cognition |url=http://journals.ut.ac.ir/pdf_28259_26f2aefa9b23b767d721f1e94459c224.html |journal= فلسفه |volume=36 |issue=1 |year=2008 |pages=59–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some difficulties with this interpretation of Kant include (i) the view that Kant holds the empirical, and specifically knowledge of the body, cannot support ''a priori'' transcendental claims,&lt;ref name=RoschE&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and (ii) the view that Kant holds that transcendental philosophy, although charged with the responsibility of explaining how we can have empirical knowledge, is not itself empirical.&lt;ref name= SvareH&gt;
{{cite book |title=Body and Practice in Kant |author= Helge Svare |chapter=Chapter 7: The body and the transcendental |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAsCcVhy-IIC&amp;pg=PA213 |pages= 213 ''ff'' |isbn=9781402041198 |year= 2006 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[George Santayana]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Martin Heidegger]] and others in the broadly [[Existentialism|existential]] tradition have proposed philosophies of mind influencing the development of the modern 'embodiment' thesis.&lt;ref&gt;Cowart, Monica 2004 Embodied Cognition
The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, {{ISSN|2161-0002}}, [http://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/], retrieved 27 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The embodiment movement in [[artificial intelligence]] has fueled the embodiment argument in philosophy and a revised view of [[ethology]]:&lt;ref name=Hendriks&gt;{{cite book |author= Horst Hendriks-Jansen |year=1996 |title=Catching Ourselves in the Act: Situated Activity, Interactive Emergence, Evolution, and Human Thought |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262082464 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3PzBEBFMFvAC&amp;pg=PA10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Species-typical activity patterns must be thought of as emergent phenomena in three different senses of the word. They have emerged...through natural selection, ....by a process of maturation and/or learning, ...and from interactions between the creature's low-level activities and its species-typical environment."
:::—Horst Hendriks-Jansen   ''Catching Ourselves in the Act'', p. 10

These developments have also given emotions a new status in [[philosophy of mind]] as an indispensable constituent, rather than a non-essential addition to rational intellectual thought.
In philosophy of mind, the idea that cognition is embodied is sympathetic with other views of cognition such as [[situated cognition]] or [[externalism]]. This is a radical move towards a total re-localization of mental processes out of the neural domain.&lt;ref&gt;Di Paolo, Ezequiel

==Connections with the sciences==

Embodied cognition is a topic of research in [[social psychology|social]] and [[cognitive psychology]], covering issues such as [[social interaction]] and [[decision-making]].&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borghi|first1=Anna M.|last2=Cimatti|first2=Felice|title=Embodied cognition and beyond: Acting and sensing the body|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=48|issue=3|year=2010|pages=763–773|issn=0028-3932|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.10.029|pmid=19913041}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Embodied cognition reflects the argument that the [[motor system]] influences our cognition, just as the mind influences bodily actions.  For example, when participants hold a pencil in their teeth engaging the muscles of a smile, they comprehend pleasant sentences faster than unpleasant ones, while holding a pencil between their nose and upper lip to engage the muscles of a frown has the reverse effect.&lt;ref name="Glenberg et al."&gt;{{cite book|author1=Diane Pecher|author2=Rolf A. Zwaan|title=Grounding Cognition: The Role of Perception and Action in Memory, Language, and Thinking|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RaxTkckBnh4C&amp;pg=PA115|date=10 January 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44247-3|pages=115–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Lakoff]] (a [[cognitive scientist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]]) and his collaborators (including [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]], [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]], and [[Rafael E. Núñez]]) have written a series of books promoting and expanding the thesis based on discoveries in [[cognitive science]], such as [[conceptual metaphor]] and [[image schema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Lakoff|Johnson|1980}}; {{Harvtxt|Lakoff|1987}}; {{Harvtxt|Lakoff|Turner|1989}}; {{Harvtxt|Lakoff|Johnson|1999}}; {{Harvnb|Lakoff|Nunez|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robotic]]s researchers such as [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Hans Moravec]] and [[Rolf Pfeifer]] have argued that true [[artificial intelligence]] can only be achieved by machines that have [[Sensory perception|sensory]] and [[motor skills]] and are connected to the world through a body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}, {{Harvnb|Brooks|1990}}, {{Harvnb|Pfeiffer|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insights of these robotics researchers have in turn inspired philosophers like [[Andy Clark]] and [[Horst Hendriks-Jansen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|1997}}, {{Harvnb|Hendriks-Jansen|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neurobiology|Neuroscientist]]s [[Gerald Edelman]], [[António Damásio]] and others have outlined the connection between the body, individual structures in the brain and aspects of the mind such as [[consciousness]], [[emotion]], [[self-awareness]] and [[Will (philosophy)|will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edelman|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Damasio|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biology]] has also inspired [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Humberto Maturana]], [[Francisco Varela]], [[Eleanor Rosch]] and [[Evan Thompson]] to develop a closely related version of the idea, which they call [[enactivism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Maturana|Varela|1987}}, {{Harvnb|Varela|Thompson|Rosch|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[motor theory of speech perception]] proposed by [[Alvin Liberman]] and colleagues at the [[Haskins Laboratories]] argues that the identification of words is embodied in perception of the bodily movements by which spoken words are made.&lt;ref name="Liberman67"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4170865|year=1967|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Cooper|first2=FS|last3=Shankweiler|first3=DP|last4=Studdert-Kennedy|first4=M|title=Perception of the speech code|volume=74|issue=6|pages=431–61|journal=Psychological Review|ref=harv|doi=10.1037/h0020279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=4075760|year=1985|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Mattingly|first2=IG|title=The motor theory of speech perception revised|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–36|journal=Cognition|ref=harv|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(85)90021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=2643163|year=1989|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Mattingly|first2=IG|title=A specialization for speech perception|volume=243|issue=4890|pages=489–94|journal=Science|ref=harv|doi=10.1126/science.2643163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liberman00"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10782105|year=2000|last1=Liberman|first1=AM|last2=Whalen|first2=DH|title=On the relation of speech to language|volume=4|issue=5|pages=187–196|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|ref=harv|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01471-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galantucci"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17048719|year=2006|last1=Galantucci|first1=B|last2=Fowler|first2=CA|last3=Turvey|first3=MT|title=The motor theory of speech perception reviewed|volume=13|issue=3|pages=361–77|pmc=2746041|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|ref=harv|doi=10.3758/bf03193857}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In related work at Haskins, Paul Mermelstein, [[Philip Rubin]], [[Louis M. Goldstein|Louis Goldstein]], and colleagues developed [[articulatory synthesis]] tools for computationally modeling the physiology and aeroacoustics of the [[vocal tract]], demonstrating how cognition and perception of speech can be shaped by biological constraints. This was extended into the audio-visual domain by the "talking heads" approach of Eric Vatikiotis-Bateson, Rubin, and other colleagues.

==Psychology==

===Visual search===
[[File:Bekkering &amp; Neggers Figure.png|thumb|250px|Graph of the visual search task results showing that participants made less object orientation errors when grasping than pointing.]]
One embodied cognition study shows that action [[intention]] can affect processing in [[visual search]], with more orientation errors for pointing than for grasping.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bekkering H, Neggers SF |title=Visual search is modulated by action intentions |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=370–4 |year=2002 |pmid=12137141 |doi= 10.1111/j.0956-7976.2002.00466.x|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Participants either pointed to or grasped target objects of 2 colors and 2 orientations (45° and 135°).  There were randomized numbers of distractors as well (0, 3, 6, or 9), which differed from the target in color, orientation, or both.  A tone sounded to inform participants which target orientation to find.  Participants kept their eyes on a fixation point until it turned from red to the target color.  The screen then lit up and the participants searched for the target, either pointing to it or grasping it (depending on the block).  There were 2 blocks for pointing and 2 for grasping, with the order counterbalanced.  Each block had 64 trials.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;

Results from the experiment show that accuracy decreases with an increase in the number of distractors.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  Overall, participants made more orientation errors than color errors.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  There was no main effect of [[accuracy]] between the pointing and grasping conditions, but participants made significantly fewer orientation errors in the grasping condition than in the pointing condition.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  Color errors were the same in both conditions.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  Because orientation is important in grasping an object, these results fit with the researchers' hypothesis that the plan to grasp an object will aid in orientation accuracy.&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;  This supports embodied cognition because action intention (planning to grasp an object) can affect visual processing of task-relevant information (orientation).&lt;ref name="Bekkering &amp; Neggers" /&gt;

===Distance perception===

Internal states can affect distance [[perception]], which relates to embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Balcetis E, Dunning D |title=Cognitive dissonance and the perception of natural environments |journal=Psychol Sci |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=917–21 |year=2007 |pmid=17894610 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.02000.x |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers randomly assigned college student participants to high-choice, low-choice, and control conditions. The high-choice condition signed a “freedom of choice” consent form indicating their decision to wear a [[Carmen Miranda]] costume and walk across a busy area of campus.  Low-choice participants signed an “experimenter choice” consent form, indicating the experimenter assigned the participant to wear the costume.  A control group walked across campus but did not wear a costume.  At the conclusion of the experiment, each participant completed a survey which asked them to estimate the distance they walked.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al"/&gt;

The high-choice participants perceived the distance walked as significantly shorter than participants in the low-choice and control groups, even though they walked the same distance.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  The manipulation caused high-choice participants to feel responsible for the choice to walk in the embarrassing costume.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  This created [[cognitive dissonance]], which refers to a discrepancy between [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  High-choice participants reconciled their thoughts and actions by perceiving the distance as shorter.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  These results show the ability of internal states to affect perception of physical distance moved, which illustrates the reciprocal relationship of the body and mind in embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;

===Perspective===
[[File:Tversky and Hard figure.png|thumb|250px|Graph depicting the percentage of responses by perspective for each photograph condition.]]  
Researchers have found that when making judgements about objects in photographs, people will take the [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] of a person in the picture instead of their own.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tversky|first1=Barbara|last2=Hard|first2=Bridgette Martin|title=Embodied and disembodied cognition: Spatial perspective-taking|journal=Cognition|volume=110|issue=1|year=2009|pages=124–129|issn=0010-0277|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2008.10.008|pmid=19056081}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They showed college undergraduate participants 1 of 3 photographs and asked where 1 object in the picture was compared to the other object.  For example, if the 2 objects were an apple and a banana, the participants would have to respond to a question about the location of the apple compared to the banana. The photographs either had no person, a person looking at the object, in this case the banana, or a person reaching for the banana. The photograph and question appeared in a larger set of questionnaires not related to the study.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;

Results show that participants who viewed photographs that included a person were significantly more likely to respond from another's perspective than those who saw photographs with no person.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  There were no differences in perspective of responses for the person looking versus reaching.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  Participants who saw the scene without a person were significantly more likely to respond from their own perspective.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  This means that the presence of a person in the photograph affected the perspective used even though the question focused solely on the two objects.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;  The researchers state that these results suggest ''disembodied'' cognition, in which the participants put themselves into the body of the person in the photograph.&lt;ref name="Tversky &amp; Hard" /&gt;

===Language comprehension===
{{See also|Embodied language processing}}
Some researchers [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|extend embodied cognition to include language]].&lt;ref name="Paradowski2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB |title=Storytelling in language teaching – re-evaluating the weight of kinaesthetic modality for brain-compatible pedagogy |journal=Storytelling: An Interdisciplinary Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=13–52 |year=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10407960/Storytelling_in_language_teaching_re-evaluating_the_weight_of_kinaesthetic_modality_for_brain-compatible_pedagogy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt; They describe language as a tool that aids in broadening our sense of body.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;  For instance, when asked to identify “this” object, participants most often choose an object near to them.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;  Conversely, when asked to identify “that” object, participants choose an object further away from them.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;  Language allows us to distinguish between distances in more complex ways than the simple perceptual difference between near and far objects.&lt;ref name="BorghiCimatti2010"/&gt;

[[File:Olmstead et al. figure.png|thumb|250px|The change in "relative phase shift" for different conditions in the study. Participants had a significantly larger change for "performable" sentences than "inanimate" sentences and swinging only.]]
The motor system is involved in [[language]] comprehension, in this case when sentences were performable by a human, there was a change in participants' overall movement of a [[pendulum]].&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al."&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olmstead AJ, Viswanathan N, Aicher KA, Fowler CA |title=Sentence comprehension affects the dynamics of bimanual coordination: implications for embodied cognition |journal=Q J Exp Psychol (Hove) |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=2409–17 |year=2009 |pmid=19396732 |doi=10.1080/17470210902846765 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers performed an experiment in which college undergraduate participants swung a pendulum while completing a "sentence judgement task."  Participants would swing the pendulum with both hands for 10 seconds before a prompt and then a sentence would appear on the screen until the participant responded.  In the control condition, participants swung the pendulum without performing the "sentence judgement task."  Each trial had half "plausible" and half "implausible" sentences.  The "plausible" sentences made sense semantically, while the "implausible" ones did not.  The "performable" sentences could be performed by a human, while the "inanimate" sentences could not.  Participants responded by saying "yes" to the "plausible" sentences.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;

Results show a significant "relative phase shift," or overall change in movement of the swinging pendulum, for the "performable" sentences.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  This change did not occur for "inanimate" sentences or the control condition.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  The researchers did not expect an overall phase shift, instead they expected a change in the variability of movement, or the "[[standard deviation]] of relative phase shift."&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  Although not entirely expected, these results support embodied cognition and show that the motor system is involved in the understanding of language.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;  The researchers suggest that the nature of this relationship needs to be further studied to determine the exact [[correlation]] this task has to bi-manual motor movements.&lt;ref name="Olmstead et al." /&gt;

Embodiment effects emerge in the way in which people of different sex and temperament perceive verbal material, such as common adjectives and abstract and neutral nouns. Trofimova, who first described this phenomenon in her experiments, called it "projection through capacities". This phenomenon emerges when people's lexical perception depends upon their capacities to handle the events; when their information processing registers mostly those aspects of objects or of a situation that they can properly react to and deal with according to their inherent capacities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=1999|title=How people of different age sex and temperament estimate the world.|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=85/2|pages=533–552|doi=10.2466/pr0.1999.85.2.533}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=2012|title=Understanding misunderstanding: a study of sex differences in meaning attribution.|journal= Psychological Research|volume=77 | issue = 6 |pages=748–760|DOI=10.1007/s00426-012-0462-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova|first1=IN|year=2014|title=Observer bias: an interaction of temperament traits with biases in the semantic perception of lexical material.|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9 | issue = 1 |pages=e85677.|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0085677|pmid=24475048|pmc=3903487}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example, in these studies males with stronger motor-physical endurance estimated abstractions describing people-, work/reality- and time-related concepts in more positive terms than males with a weaker endurance. Females with stronger social or physical endurance estimated social attractors in more positive terms than weaker females. Both male and female temperament groups with higher sociability showed a universal positive bias in their estimations of neutral words, especially for social and work/reality-related concepts, in comparison to participants with lower sociability. Capacities related to the tempo of activities also appeared to impact the perception of lexical material: men with faster motor-physical tempo estimated neutral, abstract time-related concepts significantly in more positive terms than men with slower tempo.

===Memory===

A study examining [[memory]] and embodied cognition illustrates that people remember more of the gist of a story when they physically act it out.&lt;ref name="Scott et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Christina L.|last2=Harris|first2=Richard Jackson|last3=Rothe|first3=Alicia R.|title=Embodied Cognition Through Improvisation Improves Memory for a Dramatic Monologue|journal=Discourse Processes|volume=31|issue=3|year=2001|pages=293–305|issn=0163-853X|doi=10.1207/S15326950dp31-3_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers divided female participants randomly into 5 groups, which were "Read Only," "Writing," "Collaborative Discussion," "Independent Discussion," and "[[Improvisation]]."  All participants received a [[monologue]] about teen addiction and were told to pay attention to details about the character and action in the monologue.  Participants were given 5 minutes to read the monologue twice, unaware of a future recall test.  In the "Read Only" condition participants filled out unrelated questionnaires after reading the monologue.  In the "Writing" condition participants responded to 5 questions about the story from the perspective of the character in the monologue.  They had 6 minutes to answer each question.  In the "Collaborative Discussion" condition participants responded from the character's perspective to the same questions as the "Writing" group, but in groups of 4 or 5 women.  They were also given 6 minutes per question and everyone participated in answering each question.  The "Independent Discussion" condition was the same as the "Collaborative Discussion," except 1 person answered each question.  In the "Improvisation" condition participants acted out 5 scenes from the monologue in groups of 5 women.  The researchers suggest that this condition involves embodied cognition and will produce better memory for the monologue.  Every participant played the main character and a supporting character once.  Participants were given short prompts from lines in the monologue, which were excluded from the memory test.  Participants had 2 minutes to choose characters and 4 minutes for improvisations.  The recall test was the monologue with 96 words or phrases missing.  Participants had to fill in the blanks as accurately as possible.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;

Researchers gave the recall test to a group who did not read the monologue.  They scored significantly lower than the other groups, which indicated that guessing was not easy.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  In coding the answers to the recall test, exact words were labeled "Verbatim", and correct content but varied wording was labeled "Gist".  The combination of "Verbatim" and "Gist" was called "Total Memory."  The "Improvisational" group had more "Gist" memories than any other group and had more "Total Memory" than both of the discussion groups.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  The results fit the researchers' hypothesis that the "Improvisational" group would remember more because they actively rehearsed the information from the monologue.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  Although other groups had also elaborately encoded the information, the "Improvisation" group remembered significantly more than the discussion groups and marginally more than the "Reading Only" and "Writing" groups.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  Simply experiencing the monologue in an active way aids in remembering the "Gist."&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;  There were no differences across groups for "Verbatim" memory, which they suggest could take longer than the limited time during the experiment to develop.&lt;ref name="Scott et al." /&gt;

===Learning===

Ideas stemming from embodied cognition research have been applied to the field of learning. It has been shown that bodily activity can be used to enhance learning in several studies.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Skulmowski |first1=Alexander |last2=Rey |first2=Günter Daniel |title=Embodied learning: introducing a taxonomy based on bodily engagement and task integration |journal=Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications |date=2018 |volume=3 |doi=10.1186/s41235-018-0092-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on embodied learning often utilizes educational technology in the form of virtual reality, mixed reality, or motion caputure to transform learning activities into immersive experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindgren |first1=Robb |last2=Johnson-Glenberg |first2=Mina |title=Emboldened by Embodiment |journal=Educational Researcher |date=November 2013 |volume=42 |issue=8 |pages=445–452 |doi=10.3102/0013189X13511661}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are theoretical approaches that define the level of embodiment of these learning platforms based on factors such as their capabilities for immersion and sensorimotor activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson-Glenberg |first1=Mina C. |last2=Birchfield |first2=David A. |last3=Tolentino |first3=Lisa |last4=Koziupa |first4=Tatyana |title=Collaborative embodied learning in mixed reality motion-capture environments: Two science studies. |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |date=2014 |volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=86–104 |doi=10.1037/a0034008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theoretical systems analyze embodied learning in terms of the degree of bodily engagement and whether the embodiment is integrated into a learning task.&lt;ref name="Skulmowski &amp; Rey" /&gt;

==Reasoning==
A series of experiments demonstrated the interrelation between motor experience and high-level reasoning. For example, although most individuals recruit visual processes when presented with spatial problems such as mental rotation tasks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hyun | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Luck | first2 = S. J. | year = 2007 | title = Visual working memory as the substrate for mental rotation | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 154–158 | doi=10.3758/bf03194043}}&lt;/ref&gt; motor experts favor motor processes to perform the same tasks, with higher overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D | year = 2012 | title = The role of motor processes in three-dimensional mental rotation: Shaping cognitive processing via sensorimotor experience | url = | journal = Learning and Individual Differences | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 354–359 | doi=10.1016/j.lindif.2012.02.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related study showed that motor experts use similar processes for the mental rotation of body parts and polygons, whereas non-experts treated these stimuli differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D | year = 2013a | title = Constraining movement alters the recruitment of motor processes in mental rotation | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 224 | issue = 3| pages = 447–454 | doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3324-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results were not due to underlying confounds, as demonstrated by a training study which showed mental rotation improvements after a one-year motor training, compared with controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D. | last2 = Clerc | first2 = J. | last3 = Mansy-Dannay | first3 = A. | last4 = Guerrien | first4 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Enhancing spatial ability through sport practice: Evidence for an effect of motor training on mental rotation performance | url = | journal = Journal of Individual Differences | volume = 33 | issue = 2| pages = 83–88 | doi=10.1027/1614-0001/a000075}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar patterns were also found in working memory tasks, with the ability to remember movements being greatly disrupted by a secondary verbal task in controls and by a motor task in motor experts, suggesting the involvement of different processes to store movements depending on motor experience, namely verbal for controls and motor for experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moreau | first1 = D | year = 2013b | title = Motor expertise modulates movement processing in working memory | url = | journal = Acta Psychologica | volume = 142 | issue = 3| pages = 356–361 | doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.01.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approach and avoidance===
[[File:Van Dantzig et al. table.png|thumb|250px|Table showing response times for the positive, negative, and neutral valence conditions in the approach and avoidance experiment. Participants were significantly faster for the "positive toward" condition regardless of the central word's valence.]]
In research focused on the approach and avoidance effect, people showed an approach effect for positive words.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dantzig|first1=Saskia van|last2=Zeelenberg|first2=René|last3=Pecher|first3=Diane|title=Unconstraining theories of embodied cognition|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=45|issue=2|year=2009|pages=345–351|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "positive toward condition," participants moved positive words toward the center of the screen and negative words away.  In the "negative toward condition," participants moved negative words toward the center and positive words away.  Participants were given feedback about their accuracy at the end of each of the 4 experimental blocks.  In the first experiment the word at the center of the screen had a positive [[valence (psychology)|valence]], while in the second experiment the central word had a negative valence.  In the third experiment, the center of the screen had an empty box.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;

As predicted, in the first experiment participants in the "positive toward condition" responded significantly faster than those in the "negative toward condition."&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  This fits the approach/avoidance effect in embodied cognition, which states that people are faster to approach positive things and avoid negative ones.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  In the second experiment, researchers expected participants in the "negative toward condition" to be faster, yet those in the "positive toward condition" responded significantly faster.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  Although effects were smaller in the third experiment, participants in the "positive toward condition" were still faster.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  Overall, people were faster in the "positive toward condition," regardless of the valence of the central word.  Despite mixed results regarding the researchers' expectations, they maintain that the motor system is important in processing higher level representations such as the action goal.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;  In this study, participants showed strong approach effects in the "positive toward condition," which supports embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="van Dantzig et al." /&gt;

As part of a larger study, researchers separated participants into 5 groups with different instructions.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Labroo|first1=Aparna A.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Jesper H.|title=Half the Thrill Is in the Chase: Twisted Inferences from Embodied Cognitions and Brand Evaluation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=37|issue=1|year=2010|pages=143–158|issn=0093-5301|doi=10.1086/649908}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the "approach" condition, participants were instructed to imagine physically moving the product toward them, but in the "avoid" condition, participants had to imagine moving the product away from them.  In the "control" condition, participants were instructed to simply observe the product.  The "correction" condition involved the same instructions as the approach condition, except participants were told that the body can affect judgment.  In the "approach information" condition, participants had to list 5 reasons why they would obtain the product.  After viewing a picture of an aversive product, participants rated on a scale of 1 to 7 how desirable the product was and how much they approached of or avoided the product.  They also provided how much they would pay for the product.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;

An approach/avoidance effect was found in relation to product evaluation.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;  Participants in the "approach" condition liked the aversive product significantly more and would pay more for it.  There were no differences between the "avoidance," "control," "correction," and "approach information" conditions.  Simulation of approach can affect liking and willingness to pay for a product, but the effect can be reversed if the person knows about this influence.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;  This supports embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Labroo &amp; Nielsen" /&gt;

===Self-regulation===

As part of a larger study, one experiment randomly assigned college undergraduates to 2 groups.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hung|first1=Iris W.|last2=Labroo|first2=Aparna A.|title=From Firm Muscles to Firm Willpower: Understanding the Role of Embodied Cognition in Self-Regulation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=37|issue=6|year=2011|pages=1046–1064|issn=0093-5301|doi=10.1086/657240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the "muscle-firming" condition participants grasped a pen in their hand, while in the "control" condition participants held the pen in their fingers.  The participants were then asked to fill out donations to [[Haiti]] for the [[Red Cross]] in sealed envelopes.  They were told to return the envelope regardless of whether they donated.  They also filled out questionnaires about their feelings about the Red Cross, their tendency to donate, their feelings about Haiti, what they thought the purpose of the study was, etc.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo" /&gt;

Significantly more participants in the "muscle-firming" condition than in the "control" condition donated money.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo" /&gt;  Condition did not affect the actual amount donated when participants chose to donate.  As the researchers predicted, the "muscle-firming" condition helped participants get over their physical aversion to viewing the devastation in Haiti and spend money.  Muscle-firming in this experiment may also be related to an increase in self-control, suggesting embodied cognition can play a role in self-regulation.&lt;ref name="Hung &amp; Labroo" /&gt;

Another set of studies was conducted by Shalev (2014), indicating that exposure to physical or conceptual thirst or dryness-related cues influence perceived energy and reduce self-regulation. In Study 1, participants primed with dryness-related concepts reported greater physical thirst and tiredness and lower subjective vitality. In Study 2, participants who were physically thirstywere less persistent in investing effort in an unsolvable anagram task. In Study 3, images of arid land influenced time preference regarding when to begin preparation to make a monetary investment. Finally, in Studies 4a and 4b, exposure to the names of dryness-related products influenced impressions of the vitality of a target person.&lt;ref name="Shalev"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shalev|first=I.|title=Implicit Energy Loss: Embodied Dryness Cues Influence Vitality and Depletion|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|year=2014|volume=24|pages=260–270|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2013.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some suggest that the embodied mind serves self-regulatory processes by combining movement and cognition to reach a goal.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Cole"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balcetis|first1=Emily|last2=Cole|first2=Shana|author-link1=Emily Balcetis|title=Body in Mind: The Role of Embodied Cognition in Self-Regulation|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=3|issue=5|year=2009|pages=759–774|issn=1751-9004|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00197.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the embodied mind has a facilitative effect.  Some judgments, such as the emotion of a face, are detected more quickly when a participant mimics the facial expression that is being evaluated.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  Individuals holding a pen in their mouths to freeze their facial muscles and make them unable to mimic the expression were less able to judge emotions.  Goal-relevant actions may be encouraged by embodied cognition, as evidenced by the automated approach and avoidance of certain environmental cues.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; et al" /&gt;  Embodied cognition is also influenced by the situation.  If one moves in a way previously associated with danger, the body may require a greater level of [[information processing]] than if the body moves in a way associated with a benign situation.&lt;ref name="Balcetis &amp; Cole"/&gt;

===Social psychology===
[[File:Embodied Rapport.png|thumb|500px|Results from the social embodied cognition study that illustrate the relationship between positive emotions, observed behavioral synchrony, and embodied rapport.]]
Some social psychologists examined embodied cognition and hypothesized that embodied cognition would be supported by embodied rapport.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vacharkulksemsuk T, Fredrickson BL |title=Strangers in sync: Achieving embodied rapport through shared movements |journal=J Exp Soc Psychol |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=399–402 |year=2012 |pmid=22389521 |pmc=3290409 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.07.015 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Embodied rapport would be demonstrated by pairs of same-sex strangers using Aron’s paradigm, which instructs participants to alternate asking certain questions and to progressively self-disclose.  The researchers predicted that participants would mimic each other’s movements, reflecting embodied cognition.  Half the participants completed a control task of reading and editing a scientific article, while half the participants completed a shortened version of Aron’s [[self-disclosure]] paradigm.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;

There is a significant correlation between self-disclosure and positive emotions towards the other participant.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;  Participants randomly assigned to the self-disclosure task displayed more [[behavioral synchrony]] (rated by independent judges watching the tapes of each condition on mute) and reported more positive emotions than the control group.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;  Since bodily movements influence the psychological experience of the task, the relationship between self-disclosure and positive feelings towards one's partner may be an example of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Vacharkulksemsuk &amp; et al" /&gt;

===Evolutionary view ===

Embodied cognition may also be defined from the perspective of [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaschak|first1=Michael P.|last2=Maner|first2=Jon K.|last3=Miller|first3=Saul|last4=Coyle|first4=Jacqueline M.|title=Embodied social cognition: Bodies, emotions, and blackberries|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=7|year=2009|pages=1255–1256|issn=0046-2772|doi=10.1002/ejsp.692}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Evolutionary psychologists view emotion as an important [[Homeostasis|self-regulatory]] aspect of embodied cognition, and [[Motivated reasoning|emotion as a motivator]] towards [[Goal setting|goal-relevant action]].&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al" /&gt; Emotion helps drive [[adaptive behavior]].  The evolutionary perspective cites language, both spoken and written, as types of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al" /&gt;  [[Diction|Pacing]] and [[non-verbal communication]] reflect embodied cognition in spoken language.  Technical aspects of written language, such as [[italics]], [[all caps]], and [[emoticons]] promote an [[Internal monologue|inner voice]] and thereby a sense of feeling rather than thinking about a written message.&lt;ref name="Kaschak et al"/&gt;

== Cognitive science and linguistics ==
[[George Lakoff]] and his collaborators have developed several lines of evidence that suggest that people use their understanding of familiar physical objects, actions and situations (such as containers, spaces, trajectories) to understand other more complex domains (such as mathematics, relationships or death). Lakoff argues that ''all'' cognition is based on knowledge that comes from the body and that other domains are mapped onto our embodied knowledge using a combination of [[conceptual metaphor]], [[image schema]] and [[prototype theory|prototypes]].

=== Conceptual metaphor ===
{{Main|Conceptual metaphor}}
Lakoff and [[Mark Johnson (philosopher)|Mark Johnson]]{{sfn|Lakoff|Johnson|1980}} showed that humans use metaphor ubiquitously and that metaphors operate at a conceptual level (i.e., they map one conceptual domain onto another), they involve an unlimited number of individual expressions and that the same metaphor is used conventionally throughout a culture.
Lakoff and his collaborators have collected thousands of examples of conceptual metaphors in many domains.{{sfn|Lakoff|Johnson|1980}}{{sfn|Lakoff|Turner|1989}}

For example, people will typically use language about journeys to discuss the history and status of a love affair, a metaphor Lakoff and Johnson call "LOVE IS A JOURNEY". It is used in such expression as: "we arrived at a crossroads," "we parted ways", "we hit the rocks" (as in a sea journey), "she's in the driver's seat", or, simply, "we're together". In cases like these, something complex (a love affair) is described in terms of something that can be done with a body (travel through space).

=== Image schema ===

=== Prototypes ===
{{Main|Prototype theory}}
Prototypes are "typical" members of a category, e.g. a robin is a prototypical bird, but a penguin is not. The role of prototypes in human cognition was first identified and studied by [[Eleanor Rosch]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was able to show that prototypical objects are more easily categorized than non-prototypical objects, and that people answered questions about a category as a whole by reasoning about a prototype. She also identified [[prototype theory#Basic level categories|basic level categories]]:&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; categories that have prototypes that are easily visualized (such as a chair) and are associated with basic physical motions (such as "sitting"). Prototypes of basic level categories are used to reason about more general categories.

Prototype theory has been used to explain human performance on many different cognitive tasks and in a large variety of domains. George Lakoff argues that prototype theory shows that the categories that people use are based on our experience of having a body and have no resemblance to logical [[class (philosophy)|classes]] or [[type-token distinction|types]]. For Lakoff, this shows that traditional [[objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|objectivist]] accounts of [[truth]] cannot be correct.&lt;ref&gt;''Lakoff, G. [[Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things|Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind]]. '' University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-46804-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic argument against embodiment in its strict form is based on abstract meaning. Whereas the meanings of the words ‘eye’ and ‘grasp’ can be explained, to a degree, by pointing to objects and actions, those of ‘beauty’ and ‘freedom’ cannot.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that some common sensorimotor knowledge is immanent in ''freeing'' actions or instantiations of ''beauty'', but it seems likely that additional semantic binding principles are behind such concepts. So might it be necessary, after all, to place abstract semantics in an amodal meaning system? A remarkable observation has recently been offered that may be of the essence in this context: abstract terms show an over-proportionally strong tendency to be semantically linked to knowledge about emotions.&lt;ref name="meteyard"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This additional embodied–semantic link accounts for advantages in processing speed for abstract emotional terms over otherwise matched control words.&lt;ref name="kousta" /&gt; In addition, abstract words strongly activate anterior cingulate cortex, a site known to be relevant for emotion processing&lt;ref name="vigliocco"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it appears that at least some abstract words are semantically grounded in emotion knowledge.

If abstract emotion words indeed receive their meaning through grounding in emotion it is of crucial relevance&lt;ref name="wittgenstein"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the link between an abstract emotion word and its abstract concept is via manifestation of the latter in prototypical actions. The child learns an abstract emotion word such as 'joy' because it shows JOY-expressing action schemas, which language-teaching adults use as criteria for correct application of the abstract emotion word&lt;ref name="vigliocco" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "wittgenstein" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bookWitt" /&gt; Thus, the manifestation of emotions in actions becomes the crucial link between word use and internal state, and hence between sign and meaning. Only after a stock of abstract emotion words has been grounded in emotion-expressing action can further emotion terms be learnt from context.

== Artificial intelligence and robotics ==

=== History of artificial intelligence ===

The experience of AI research provides another line of evidence supporting the embodied mind thesis. In the early history of [[artificial intelligence|AI]] successes in programming high-level reasoning tasks such as chess-playing led to an unfounded optimism that all AI problems would be relatively quickly solved. These programs simulated intelligence using logic and high-level abstract symbols (an approach called [[Good old-fashioned AI]]). This "disembodied" approach ran into serious difficulties in the 1970s and 80s, as researchers discovered that abstract, disembodied reasoning was highly inefficient and could not achieve human-levels of competence on many simple tasks.&lt;ref&gt;See {{slink|History of AI|The problems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding agencies (such as [[DARPA]]) withdrew funding because the field of AI had failed to achieve its stated objectives, leading to difficult period now known as the "[[AI winter]]". Many AI researchers began to doubt that high level symbolic reasoning could ever perform well enough to solve simple problems.

[[Rodney Brooks]] argued in the mid-80s that these symbolic approaches were failing because researchers did not appreciate the importance of sensorimotor skills to intelligence in general, and applied these principals to robotics (an approach he called "[[Nouvelle AI]]"). Another successful new direction was [[neural network]]s—programs based on the actual structures within human bodies that gave rise to intelligence and learning. In the 90s, [[Artificial intelligence#Statistical|statistical AI]] achieved high levels of success in industry without using any symbolic reasoning, but instead using probabilistic techniques to make "guesses" and improve them incrementally. This process is similar to the way human beings are able to make fast, intuitive choices without stopping to reason symbolically.

=== Moravec's paradox ===
{{Main|Moravec's paradox}}

Moravec's paradox is the discovery by [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] researchers that, contrary to traditional assumptions, high-level [[reasoning]] requires very little computation, but low-level [[Sensory-motor coupling|sensorimotor]] skills require enormous computational resources. The principle was articulated by [[Hans Moravec]] (whence the name) and others in the 1980s.
As [[Hans Moravec|Moravec]] writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Encoded in the large, highly evolved sensory and motor portions of the human brain is a billion years of experience about the nature of the world and how to survive in it. The deliberate process we call reasoning is, I believe, the thinnest veneer of human thought, effective only because it is supported by this much older and much powerful, though usually unconscious, sensorimotor knowledge. We are all prodigious olympians in perceptual and motor areas, so good that we make the difficult look easy. Abstract thought, though, is a new trick, perhaps less than 100 thousand years old. We have not yet mastered it. It is not all that intrinsically difficult; it just seems so when we do it.{{sfn|Moravec|1988|pp=15–16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Approach to artificial intelligence ===

==== Solving problems of perception and locomotion directly ====
{{See also|Nouvelle AI|Situated|Behavior based AI|Embodied cognitive science}}
Many [[artificial intelligence]] researchers have argued that a machine may need a human-like body to think and speak as well as a human being. As early as 1950, [[Alan Turing]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can
buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. That process could follow the normal teaching of a
child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc.  (Turing, 1950).{{sfn|Turing 1950}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Embodiment theory was brought into artificial intelligence most notably by [[Rodney Brooks]] who showed in the 1980s that [[robot]]s could be more effective if they 'thought' ([[automated planning|planned]] or [[Information processing|processed]]) and [[perception|perceived]] as little as possible.  The robot's intelligence is geared towards only handling the minimal amount of information necessary to make its [[behavior]] be appropriate and/or as desired by its creator.

Others have argued that without taking into account both the architecture of the human brain, and embodiment, it is unrealistic to replicate accurately the processes which take place during language acquisition, comprehension, production, or during non-linguistic actions.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2012"&gt;Paradowski, Michał B. 2012. [https://www.academia.edu/2400943/Developing_Embodied_Multisensory_Dialogue_Agents Developing embodied multisensory dialogue agents]. In: Rzepka, Rafał, Michał Ptaszyński &amp; Paweł Dybala (Eds.) Linguistic and Cognitive Approaches to Dialogue Agents. Birmingham: The Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour, 6–14.&lt;/ref&gt; There have thus been suggestions that while robots are far from isomorphic with humans, they could benefit from strengthened associative connections in the optimization of their processes and their reactivity and sensitivity to environmental stimuli, and in situated human-machine interaction, and that the concept of multisensory integration be extended to cover linguistic input and the complementary information combined from temporally coincident sensory impressions.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2012"/&gt;

The embodied approach to AI has been given several names by different schools of researchers, including: [[Nouvelle AI]] (Brooks' term), [[Situated]] AI, [[Behavior based AI]] and [[Embodied cognitive science]].

==Neuroscience==
{{Cleanup rewrite|comprehensive|2=section|date=December 2011}}

One source of inspiration for embodiment theory has been research in [[cognitive neuroscience]], such as the proposals of [[Gerald Edelman]] concerning how mathematical and computational models such as [[neuronal group selection]] and neural degeneracy result in emergent categorization.

Rohrer (2005) discusses how both our neural and developmental embodiment shape both our mental and linguistic categorizations. The degree of thought abstraction has been found to be associated with physical distance which then affects associated ideas and perception of risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liberman N, Trope Y |date=2008-11-21|title= The Psychology of Transcending the Here and Now|journal= Science|volume= 322|pages= 1201–1205| doi=10.1126/science.1161958|pmid=19023074|issue = 5905|pmc = 2643344|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embodied mind thesis is compatible with some views of cognition promoted in [[neuropsychology]], such as the theories of consciousness of [[Vilayanur S. Ramachandran]], [[Gerald Edelman]], and [[Antonio Damasio]].

The modeling work of cognitive neuroscientists such as [[Francisco Varela]] and [[Walter Jackson Freeman III|Walter Freeman]] seeks to explain embodied and situated cognition in terms of [[dynamical systems]] theory and [[neurophenomenology]], but rejects the idea that the brain uses representations to do so (a position also espoused by [[Gerhard Werner]]).

==Criticisms==

Research on embodied cognition is extremely broad, covering a wide range of concepts.  Methods to study embodied cognition vary from experiment to experiment based on the [[operational definition]] used by researchers.  There is much evidence for embodied cognition, although interpretation of results and their significance may be disputed.  Researchers continue to search for the best way to study and interpret embodied cognition.

===Infants as examples===

Some&lt;ref name=Longo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Longo|first=M. R.|title=What's embodied and how can we tell?|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=39|pages=1207–1209|doi=10.1002/ejsp.684|issue=7|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticize the notion that pre-verbal children provide an ideal channel for studying embodied cognition, especially embodied [[social cognition]].&lt;ref name="Daum et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daum|first1=Moritz M.|last2=Sommerville|first2=Jessica A.|last3=Prinz|first3=Wolfgang|title=Disentangling embodied and symbolic modes of social understanding|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=7|year=2009|pages=1214–1216|issn=0046-2772|doi=10.1002/ejsp.686}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It may be impossible to know when a pre-verbal infant is a "pure model" of embodied cognition, since infants experience dramatic changes in social behavior throughout development.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;  A 9-month old has reached a different developmental stage than a 2-month old.  Looking-time and reaching measures of embodied cognition may not represent embodied cognition since infants develop [[object permanence]] of objects they can see before they develop object permanence with objects they can touch.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;  True embodied cognition suggests that children would have to first physically engage with an object to understand object permanence.&lt;ref name=Longo /&gt;

The response to this critique is that infants are "ideal models" of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Daum et al"/&gt;  Infants are the best models because they utilize symbols less than adults do.&lt;ref name="Daum et al" /&gt;  Looking-time could likely be a better measure of embodied cognition than reaching because infants have not developed certain [[fine motor skills]] yet.&lt;ref name="Daum et al" /&gt;  Infants may first develop a passive mode of embodied cognition before they develop the active mode involving fine motor movements.&lt;ref name="Daum et al"/&gt;

===Overinterpretation?===

Some criticize the conclusions made by researchers about embodied cognition.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=F.|title=Embodied cognition|journal=Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences|year=2010|volume=9|pages=619–628|doi=10.1007/s11097-010-9175-x|issue=4|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pencil-in-teeth study is frequently cited as an example of these invalidly drawn conclusions.  The researchers believed that the quicker responses to positive sentences by participants engaging their smiling muscles represented embodied cognition.&lt;ref name="Glenberg et al." /&gt;  However, opponents argue that the effects of this exercise were primed or facilitated by the engagement of certain facial muscles.&lt;ref name=Adams /&gt;  Many cases of facilitative movements of the body may be incorrectly labeled as evidence of embodied cognition.&lt;ref name=Adams /&gt;

== Six views of embodied cognition ==

# '''"Cognition is situated'''. Cognitive activity takes place in the context of a real-world environment, and inherently involves perception and action." One example of this is moving around a room while, at the same time, trying to decide where the furniture should go.
# '''"Cognition is time-pressured'''. We are 'mind on the hoof' (Clark, 1997), and cognition must be understood in terms of how it functions under the pressure of real-time interaction with the environment." When you're under pressure to make a decision, the choice that is made emerges from the confluence of pressures that you're under.  In the absence of pressure, a decision may be made differently. 
# '''"We off-load cognitive work onto the environment'''. Because of limits on our information-processing abilities (e.g., limits on attention and working memory), we exploit the environment to reduce the cognitive workload. We make the environment hold or even manipulate information for us, and we harvest that information only on a need-to-know basis." This is seen when people have calendars, agendas, PDAs, or anything to help them with everyday functions. We write things down so we can use the information when we need it, instead of taking the time to memorize or encode it into our minds.
# '''"The environment is part of the cognitive system'''. The information flow between mind and world is so dense and continuous that, for scientists studying the nature of cognitive activity, the mind alone is not a meaningful unit of analysis." This statement means that the production of cognitive activity does not come from the mind alone, but rather is a mixture of the mind and the environmental situation that we are in. These interactions become part of our cognitive systems. Our thinking, decision-making, and future are all impacted by our environmental situations.
# '''"Cognition is for action'''. The function of the mind is to guide action and things such as perception and memory must be understood in terms of their contribution to situation-appropriate behavior." This claim has to do with the purpose of perception and cognition. For example, visual information is processed to extract identity, location, and affordances (ways that we might interact with objects).  A prominent anatomical distinction is drawn between the "what" (ventral) and "where" (dorsal) pathways in visual processing.  However, the commonly labeled "where" pathway is also the "how" pathway, at least partially dedicated to action.   
# '''"Off-line cognition is body-based'''. Even when decoupled from the environment, the activity of the mind is grounded in mechanisms that evolved for interaction with the environment – that is, mechanisms of sensory processing and motor control." This is shown with infants or toddlers best. Children utilize skills and abilities they were born with, such as sucking, grasping, and listening, to learn more about the environment. The skills are broken down into five main categories that combine sensory with motor skills, sensorimotor functions. The five main skills are:
## [[Mental image|Mental Imagery]]: Is visualizing something that is not currently present in your environment.  For example, imagining a future activity, or recalling how many windows are on the first floor of a house you once lived in (even though you did not count them explicitly while living there).  
## [[Working Memory]]: Short term memory
## [[Episodic memory|Episodic Memory]]: Long term memory of specific events.  
## [[Implicit memory|Implicit Memory]]: means by which we learn certain skills until they become automatic for us. An example of this would be an adult brushing his/her teeth, or an expert race car driver putting the car in drive.
## Reasoning and Problem-Solving: Having a mental model of something will increase problem-solving approaches.

===Criticism of the six claims===
Margaret Wilson adds: "Some authors go so far as to complain that the phrase 'situated cognition' implies, falsely, that there also exists cognition that is not situated (Greeno &amp; Moore, 1993, p. 50)."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002: 627).&lt;/ref&gt; Of her six claims, she notes in her abstract, "the first three and the fifth claim appear to be at least partially true, and their usefulness is best evaluated in terms of the range of their applicability. The fourth claim, I argue, is deeply problematic. The sixth claim has received the least attention, but it may in fact be the best documented and most powerful of the six claims."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson (2002: 625).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Facadism''', '''façadism''' (or '''façadomy'''&lt;ref name="Byard1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Spencer Byard|title=The Architecture of Additions: Design and Regulation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjnqyGeW_74C&amp;pg=PA105| date=1 January 1998| publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-73021-0|pages=105–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to an architectural and construction practice where the [[facade]] of a building was designed or constructed separately from the rest of a building. More often it refers to the practice where only the facade of a building is preserved with new buildings erected behind or around it.

There are aesthetic and historical reasons for preserving building facades. Facadism can be the response to the interiors of a building becoming unusable, such as being damaged by fire. In developing areas, however, the practice is sometimes used by [[Real estate developer|property developers]] seeking to redevelop a site as a compromise to [[preservationist]]s who wish to preserve buildings of historical or aesthetic interest. It can be regarded as a compromise between [[historic preservation]] and [[demolition]] and thus has been lauded as well as decried.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

There is sometimes a blurred line between [[renovation]], [[adaptive reuse]], [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstruction]] and facadism. Sometimes buildings are renovated to such an extent that they are "skinned", preserving only the exterior shell, and used for purposes other than those for which they were originally intended. While this is equivalent to facadism, the difference is typically the retention of roof and or floor structures, maintaining a credible link to the original building. In contrast, facadism generally involves retaining only one or two street facing walls for purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and decorative purposes.&lt;ref name="Richards2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Richards| title=Facadism| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLf5erNaEEsC&amp;pg=PR7-IA17| date=12 November 2012| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-134-88952-5| pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facadomy is a practice in [[postmodern architecture]] reaching its peak in the latter half of the 20th century. The setback or podium architecture technique gives an illusion of integrity to the original building by visually separating the old from the new, helping to mitigate farcical effects such as the floors and windows not lining up or a dramatic clash of styles.

Critics label the practice as architectural sham, claiming that it sometimes results in part of the building becoming a [[folly]].

Despite being highly controversial and denounced by many preservationists as vandalism, facadism is used as the demand for new development is overwhelming community desires for preservation. Facadism appears often in cities where there is a strong pressure for new development.

While the controversial practice of facadism is encouraged by governments in some cities (such as [[Toronto]], [[Sydney]] and [[Brisbane]]), it is actively discouraged in others (such as [[Paris]] and [[Melbourne]]).

Architectural [[podium]]s are often seen by some architects as a solution to this problem and these are allowed for as part of planning frameworks in urban heritage areas.

===International policies===
The practice of facadism conflicts with [[ICOMOS]] international charters. The [[Venice Charter]], article 7, states that: "A monument is inseparable from the history to which it bears witness and from the setting in which it occurs. The moving of all or part of a monument cannot be allowed except where the safeguarding of that monument demands it or where it is justified by national or international interest of paramount importance".

===By country===

====Australia====
In Australia, the [[Burra Charter]] has some policies which deal with facadism.

=====Melbourne=====
In the rapidly growing city of Melbourne, facadism has existed as early as the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The Old Commerce building at the [[University of Melbourne]] is a prominent example of a building which has been relocated and "stuck on" a newer building.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

With the introduction of heritage controls in the later twentieth century, several large buildings have been completely "skinned".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} These include the T&amp;G buildings on Collins Street and the Savoy Hotel on Spencer Street.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

However, implementation applied only to heritage registered buildings and it was relaxed in subsequent years,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} which allowed several poor examples of facadism to appear particularly with heritage buildings of only local significance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} For example, the heritage registered Carlton &amp; United Breweries site is a large site on [[Swanston Street, Melbourne]] which has contained hollow suspended facades for almost three decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} That led the [[Melbourne City Council]] to rethink the policy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the late 1990s, facadism was discouraged with the introduction of a 10-metre policy, which advocated for the retention of at least 10 metres of the front of a building.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} This helped to retain context and the integrity of important transitions and relationships such as entrances and complex roof structures.

The Olderfleet group of buildings (which includes the Rialto and Winfield) and the 1 Collins Street development are seen as well-executed examples of this preservation policy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=====Brisbane=====
In Brisbane, facadism is encouraged by the [[Brisbane City Council]].{{citation needed| date=November 2014}} An example is the [[Myer Centre, Brisbane|Myer Centre]] which features extensive facadism of several buildings including the Hotel Carlton (1885), New York Hotel (1860) and Newspaper House. Other buildings which are facaded include the final design includes the facade of the Queensland Country Life Building (1888).

====Canada====
In Canada, all jurisdictions at the federal, provincial, territorial and municipal level have adopted the [[Standards &amp; Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada]], which does not recommend, though not explicit, facadism as good conservation practice. In general, projects which have approached projects using facadism are considered to have lost their integrity and value. Nonetheless, the preservation of the [[McLaughlin Motor Car Showroom]] during the construction of the [[Burano (building)|Burano skyscraper in Toronto]] is a recent example of facadism.

'''Fisher's geometric model''' ('''FGM''') is an [[evolution]]ary model of the [[effect size]]s and effect on [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of spontaneous [[mutations]]&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Ronald|title=[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]|year=1930|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed by [[Ronald Fisher]] to explain the distribution of effects of mutations that could contribute to [[adaptation (biology)|adaptative]] evolution.&lt;ref name=brief-history&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orr|first=Allen|title=The genetic theory of adaptation: a brief history|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|year=2005|volume=6|pages=119–127|doi=10.1038/nrg1523|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v6/n2/full/nrg1523.html|pmid=15716908|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptualization==
Sometimes referred to as the Fisher-Orr model, Fisher's model addresses the problem of adaptation (and, to some extent, [[complexity]]), and continues to be a point of reference in contemporary research on the genetic and evolutionary consequences of [[pleiotropy]].&lt;ref name=Gunter&gt;{{citation |first1=Günter P. |last1=Wagner |first2=Jianzhi |last2=Zhang |title=The pleiotropic structure of the genotype–phenotype map: the evolvability of complex organisms |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |issue=12 |pages=204–213 |date=March 2011 |doi=10.1038/nrg2949 |url=http://www.umich.edu/~zhanglab/publications/2011/Wagner_2011_NRG_12_204.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model has two forms, a geometric formalism, and a [[microscope]] analogy.  A microscope which has many knobs to adjust the lenses to obtain a sharp image has little chance of obtaining an optimally functioning image by randomly turning the knobs. The chances of a clear image are not so bad if the number of knobs is low, but the chances will decrease dramatically if the number of adjustable [[parameter]]s (knobs) is larger than two or three. Fisher introduced a geometric metaphor, which eventually became known as Fisher's geometric model.&lt;ref name=Gunter/&gt;&lt;ref name=fisher/&gt;

In his model, Fisher argues that the functioning of the microscope is analogous to the fitness of an organism. The performance of the microscope depends on the state of various knobs that can be manipulated, corresponding to distances and orientations of various lenses, whereas the fitness of an organism depends on the state of various [[phenotype|phenotypic]] character such as body size and [[beak]] length and depth. The increase in the fitness of an organism by random changes is then analogous to the attempt to improve the performance of a microscope through randomly changing the positions of the knobs on the microscope.

The analogy between the microscope and an evolving organism can be formalized by representing the phenotype of an organism as a point in a [[Clustering high-dimensional data|high-dimensional data space]], where the dimensions of that space correspond to the [[trait (biological)|trait]]s of the organism. The more independent dimensions of variation the phenotype has, the more difficult is improvement resulting from random changes. If there are many different ways to change a phenotype it becomes very unlikely that a random change affects the right combination of traits in the right way to improve fitness. Fisher noted that the smaller the effect, the higher the chance that a change is beneficial. At one extreme, changes with infinitesimally small effect have a 50% chance of improving fitness. This argument led to the widely held position that evolution proceeds by small mutations.

Furthermore, Orr discovered that both the fixation probability of a beneficial mutation and the fitness gain that is conferred by the fixation of the beneficial mutation decrease with organismal complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Orr |first=H. A. |title=Adaptation and the cost of complexity |journal=Evolution |volume=54 |pages=13–20 |year=2000 |url=http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdffiles/adaptation_orr.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2000.tb00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the predicted rate of adaptation decreases quickly with the rise in organismal complexity, a theoretical finding known as the ‘cost of complexity’.

'''Friction sensitivity''' is an approximation of the amount of [[friction]] or rubbing a compound can withstand before prematurely exploding. For instance, [[nitroglycerin]] has an extremely high sensitivity to friction, meaning that very little rubbing against it could set off a violent explosion. There is no exact determining the amount of friction required to set off a compound, but is rather approximated by the amount of force applied and the amount of time before the compound explodes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11043">[[File:Frog's leg galvanoscope.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Frog's-leg galvanoscope]]
The '''frog galvanoscope''' was a sensitive electrical instrument used to detect [[voltage]]&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  It consists of skinned frog's leg with electrical connections to a nerve.  The instrument was invented by [[Luigi Galvani]] and improved by [[Carlo Matteucci]].

The frog galvanoscope, and other experiments with frogs played a part in the dispute between Galvani and [[Alessandro Volta]] over the nature of electricity.  The instrument is extremely sensitive and continued to be used well into the nineteenth century, even after [[electromechanical]] meters came into use.

==Terminology==
Synonyms for this device include '''galvanoscopic frog''', '''frog's leg galvanoscope''', '''frog galvanometer''', '''rheoscopic frog''', and '''frog electroscope'''.  The device is properly called a ''galvanoscope'' rather than ''galvanometer'' since the latter implies accurate measurement whereas a galvanoscope only gives an indication.&lt;ref name="Hackmann, p. 257"&gt;Hackmann, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;  In modern usage a [[galvanometer]] is a sensitive laboratory instrument for measuring current, not voltage.  Everyday current meters for use in the field are called [[ammeter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hackmann, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar distinction can be made between [[electroscope]]s, [[electrometer]]s, and [[voltmeter]]s for voltage measurements.

==History==
Frogs were a popular subject of experiment in the laboratories of early scientists.  They are small, easily handled, and there is a ready supply.  [[Marcello Malpighi]], for instance, used frogs in his study of lungs in the seventeenth century.  Frogs were particularly suitable for the study of muscle activity.  Especially in the legs, the muscle contractions are readily observed and the nerves are easily dissected out.  Another desirable feature for scientists was that these contractions continued after death for a considerable time.  Also in the seventeenth century, [[Leopoldo Caldani]] and [[Felice Fontana]] subjected frogs to electric shocks to test [[Albrecht von Haller]]'s [[Hallerian physiology|irritability theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luigi Galvani]], a lecturer at the [[University of Bologna]], was researching the [[nervous system]] of frogs from around 1780.  This research included the muscular response to [[opiate]]s and [[static electricity]], for which experiments the spinal cord and rear legs of a frog were dissected out together and the skin removed.  In 1781,&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; an observation was made while a frog was being so dissected.  An [[Electrostatic generator|electric machine]] discharged just at the moment one of Galvani's assistants touched the [[crural nerve]] of a dissected frog with a scalpel.  The frog's legs twitched as the discharge happened.&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvani found that he could make the prepared leg of a frog (see the [[#Construction|''Construction'']] section) twitch by connecting a metal circuit from a nerve to a muscle, thus inventing the first frog galvanoscope.&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvani published these results in 1791 in ''De viribus electricitatis''.&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative version of the story of the frog response at a distance has the frogs being prepared for a soup on the same table as a running electric machine.  Galvani's wife notices the frog twitch when an assistant accidentally touches a nerve and reports the phenomenon to her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkinson, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  This story originates with [[Jean-Louis Alibert]] and, according to Piccolino and Bresadola, was probably invented by him.&lt;ref&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, p. 5, citing [[Adolphe Ganot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Galvani, and his nephew [[Giovanni Aldini]], used the frog galvanoscope in their electrical experiments.  [[Carlo Matteucci]] improved the instrument and brought it to wider attention.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvani used the frog galvanoscope to investigate and promote the theory of ''animal electricity'', that is, that there was a [[vitalism|vital life force]] in living things that manifested itself as a new kind of electricity.  [[Alessandro Volta]] opposed this theory, believing that the electricity that Galvani and other proponents were witnessing was due to metal [[contact electrification]] in the circuit.  Volta's motivation in inventing the [[voltaic pile]] (the forerunner of the common [[zinc–carbon battery]]) was largely to enable him to construct a circuit entirely with non-biological material to show that the vital force was not necessary to produce the electrical effects seen in animal experiments.  Matteucci, in answer to Volta, and to show that metal contacts were not necessary, constructed a circuit entirely out of biological material, including a [[frog battery]].  Neither the animal electricity theory of Galvani nor the contact electrification theory of Volta forms part of modern electrical science.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Clarke &amp; Jacyna, p. 199|Clarke &amp; O'Malley, p. 186|Hellman, pp. 31–32|Bird (1848), pp. 344–345|Matteucci (1845), pp.284–285}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[Alan Hodgkin]] in the 1930s showed that there is indeed an [[ion]]ic current flowing in nerves.&lt;ref name=Picc75&gt;Piccolino &amp; Bresadola, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Matteucci used the frog galvanoscope to study the relationship of electricity to muscles, including in freshly amputated human limbs.  Matteucci concluded from his measurements that there was an electric current continually flowing from the interior, to the exterior of all muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;  Matteucci's idea was widely accepted by his contemporaries, but this is no longer believed and his results are now explained in terms of [[injury potential]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Jacyna, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
An entire frog's hind leg is removed from the frog's body with the [[sciatic nerve]] still attached, and possibly also a portion of the [[spinal cord]].  The leg is skinned, and two electrical connections are made.  These may be made to the nerve and the foot of the frog's leg by wrapping them with metal wire or foil,&lt;ref name="Hare, p. 4"&gt;Hare, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; but a more convenient instrument is Matteucci's arrangement shown in the image.  The leg is placed in a glass tube with just the nerve protruding.  Connection is made to two different points on the nerve.&lt;ref name=Bird345&gt;Bird, p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Matteucci, the instrument is most accurate if direct electrical contact with muscle is avoided.  That is, connections are made only to the nerve.  Matteucci also advises that the nerve should be well stripped and that contacts to it can be made with wet paper in order to avoid using sharp metal probes directly on the nerve.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; O'Malley, pp. 188–189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
When the frog's leg is connected to a circuit with an [[electric potential]], the muscles will contract and the leg will twitch briefly.  It will twitch again when the circuit is broken.&lt;ref name="Hare, p. 4"/&gt;  The instrument is capable of detecting extremely small [[voltage]]s, and could far surpass other instruments available in the first half of the nineteenth century, including the electromagnetic [[galvanometer]] and the [[gold-leaf electroscope]].  For this reason, it remained popular long after other instruments became available.  The galvanometer was made possible in 1820 by the discovery by [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] that electric currents would deflect a compass needle, and the gold-leaf electroscope was even earlier ([[Abraham Bennet]], 1786).&lt;ref&gt;Keithley, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet [[Golding Bird]] could still write in 1848 that "the irritable muscles of a frog's legs were no less than 56,000 times more delicate a test of electricity than the most sensitive condensing electrometer."&lt;ref&gt;Bird, p. 345 citing Wilkinson, 1845&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''condenser'' used by Bird here means a coil, so named by [[Johann Poggendorff]] by analogy with Volta's term for a [[Capacitor#Condenser|capacitor]].&lt;ref name="Hackmann, p. 257"/&gt;

The frog galvanoscope can be used to detect the direction of [[electric current]].  A frog's leg that has been somewhat desensitised is needed for this.  The sensitivity of the instrument is greatest with a freshly prepared leg and then falls off with time, so an older leg is best for this.  The response of the leg is greater to currents in one direction than the other and with a suitably desensitised leg it may only respond to currents in one direction.  For a current going into the leg from the nerve, the leg will twitch on making the circuit.  For a current passing out of the leg, it will twitch on breaking the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

The major drawback of the frog galvanoscope is that the frog leg frequently needs replacing.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke &amp; Jacyna, citing Matteucci&lt;/ref&gt;  The leg will continue to respond for up to 44 hours, but after that a fresh one must be prepared.&lt;ref name="Picc75"/&gt;

'''Gary Kenneth King''' (born September 29, 1954) is an American [[Attorney at law|lawyer]] who served as the 30th [[Attorney General of New Mexico]], serving from January 1, 2007 to January 1, 2015. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he won his party's nomination and lost the general election to become [[Governor of New Mexico]] in [[New Mexico gubernatorial election, 2014|2014]].

King is the son of [[Bruce King]], a three-time [[Governor of New Mexico]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/5843/gary-king|title=Gary King's Biography - Project Vote Smart|publisher=Votesmart.org|date=1954-09-29|accessdate=2014-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Alice M. King, former [[First Lady]] of New Mexico. He attended [[New Mexico State University]] and obtained a bachelor's degree in Chemistry in 1976. He received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from [[University of Colorado, Boulder]] in 1980. 

He then attended the [[University of New Mexico School of Law]], where he received his J.D. In 1984, King formed the law firm of King and Stanley in [[Moriarty, New Mexico]]; in 1990, he assumed the position of Corporate General Counsel and Senior Environmental Scientist with Advanced Sciences, Inc., an environmental consulting firm. In 1998, he became the Policy Advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management at the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE) in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Within a year, he became the Department’s Director of the Office of Worker and Community Transition. While at the DOE, he developed and implemented a program fostering cooperation between federal, state, local and Native American governments to enhance cleanup activities. He served for 12 years in the [[New Mexico House of Representatives]]. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Political career==
In 2004, King ran for [[New Mexico's 2nd congressional district]] seat, losing to incumbent Republican [[Steve Pearce (politician)|Steve Pearce]] by 60%-to-40%. In 2006, King was elected [[Attorney General of New Mexico]]. He was re-elected in 2010, winning against [[Curry County, New Mexico|Curry County]] District Attorney [[Matthew Chandler (District Attorney)|Matthew Chandler]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

On March 2, 2011, King on behalf of the Respondent, New Mexico, argued before the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Bullcoming v. New Mexico]]''. On July 10, 2012, King officially announced that he was seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of New Mexico. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==2014 Gubernatorial race==
{{main|New Mexico gubernatorial election, 2014}}
On June 3, 2014, King won the New Mexico Democratic Primary for Governor, defeating the following candidates; Allen Webber, Lawrence Rael, Howie Morales and Linda Lopez, which all of them immediately endorsed him after losing the primary election. King unsuccessfully ran against incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor [[Susana Martinez]] in the General election. He told fellow Democrats at a fundraiser that Martinez "does not have a Latino heart".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/nm-dem-says-gop-guv-martinez-does-not-have-latino-heart_804671.html "King on Martinez: 'no Latino heart'"], weeklystandard.com; accessed October 18, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
Though grazing rights have never been codified in [[United States]] law, the concept of such rights descends from the English concept of the commons, a piece of land over which people, often neighboring landowners, could exercise one of a number of traditional rights, including livestock grazing.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, K.R. 2002. Public Lands and Political Meaning: Ranchers, the Government, and the Property Between Them. Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 19th century, the traditional practice of grazing open rangeland in the United States was rarely disputed because of the sheer amount of unsettled open land. However, as the population of the western United States increased in the mid-to-late 19th century, range wars often erupted over the ranchers' perceived rights to graze their cattle as western rangelands deteriorated with overuse.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischner, T. L. 2009. Livestock grazing and wildlife conservation in the American West: historical, policy and conservation biology perspectives. Wild Rangelands: Conserving Wildlife While Maintaining Livestock in Semi-Arid Ecosystems (eds J. T. du Toit, R. Kock and J. C. Deutsch). Chidester, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, p. 235-265. pdoi: 10.1002/9781444317091.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the [[Taylor Grazing Act]] formally set out the federal government's powers and policy on grazing federal lands in the [[western United States]] by establishing the Division of Grazing and procedures for issuing permits to graze federal lands for a fixed period of time. The Division of Grazing was renamed the US Grazing Service in 1939 and then merged in 1946 with the General Land Office to become the [[Bureau of Land Management]], which along with the [[United States Forest Service]] oversees public lands grazing in 16 western states today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/grazing.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, grazing was never established as a legal right in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Donahue D. 2005. Western grazing: the capture of grass, ground, and government. Environmental Law 35:721-806.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Taylor Grazing Act authorized only the permitted use of lands designated as available for livestock grazing while specifying that grazing permits "convey no right, title, or interest" to such lands.&lt;ref&gt;United States Code of Federal Regulations 4130.2 (c) Retrieved from http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=65dfe1cec94944c989e83b4eb39cd3ba;rgn=div5;view=text;node=43%3A2.1.1.4.92;idno=43;cc=ecfr#PartTop&lt;/ref&gt; Although the regulations stipulated by the Taylor Grazing Act apply only to grazing on Bureau of Land Management lands, the Chief of the Forest Service is authorized to permit or suspend grazing on Forest Service administered property, and many Forest Service grazing regulations resemble those of the Taylor Grazing Act.&lt;ref&gt;United States Code of Federal Regulations 36 § 222.1-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dalmatia ==
In [[Dalmatia]], [[judgment]]s about grazing rights are a fundamental part of the [[jurisprudence]]. The oldest court verdict in Dalmatia in a court case about grazing rights dates from the 14th century. It is a [[usufruct]] of [[property]], which belongs to someone else, or it is a use of a property. Use of someone else's  property requires a [[contract]] (written or not) about the usufruct. The court may declare parts of the contract as unlawful.

If there is no contract, [[common law]] (also called [[case law]]) comes to apply. The decisions on who was allowed to judge on grazing rights cases were different in the [[Middle Ages]], which reasoned in [[tradition]] and in the natural resources in each area, such as water, meadows, lawns and others. Some [[peasant]]s wrote their own [[statute]], like [[Poljica republic]] in 1440. Also, some [[duke]]s wrote together with some peasants their own statute, like [[Law codex of Vinodol]] from 1288.&lt;ref&gt;Magyar Országos Levéltár&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7276">The '''Grit, not grass hypothesis''' is an evolutionary hypothesis that explains the evolution of high-crowned teeth, particularly in New World mammals. The hypothesis is that the ingestion of gritty [[soil]] is the primary driver of [[hypsodont]] tooth development, not the [[silica]]-rich composition of [[grass]], as was previously thought.&lt;ref name="jardine2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jardine|first1=Phillip E.|last2=Janis|first2=Christine M.|last3=Sahney|first3=Sarda|last4=Benton|first4=Michael J.|authorlink4 = Michael Benton|title=Grit not grass: Concordant patterns of early origin of hypsodonty in Great Plains ungulates and Glires|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=2012|volume=365-366|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditional Coevolution Hypothesis==
Since the morphology of the hypsodont tooth is suited to a more abrasive diet, hypsodonty was thought to have evolved concurrently with the spread of [[grasslands]]. During the [[Cretaceous]] Period (145-66 million years ago), the Great Plains were covered by a shallow [[Inland sea (geology)|inland sea]] called the [[Western Interior Seaway]] which began to recede during the [[Late Cretaceous]] to the [[Paleocene]] (65-55 million years ago), leaving behind thick marine deposits and a relatively flat terrain. During the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs (25 million years), the continental climate became favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined and grasslands became much more widespread. The grasslands provided a new [[Ecological niche|niche]] for mammals, including many [[ungulate]]s that switched from browsing diets to grazing diets. Grass contains silica-rich phytoliths (abrasive granules), which wear away dental tissue more quickly. So the spread of grasslands was linked to the development of high-crowned (hypsodont) teeth in grazers.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==Modern Evolutionary Hypothesis==
===Early Evidence===
In 2006 Strömberg examined the independent acquisition of high-crowned cheek teeth (hypsodonty) in several ungulate lineages (e.g., [[camelid]]s, [[equid]]s, rhinoceroses) from the early to middle Miocene of North America, which had been classically linked to the spread of grasslands She showed habitats dominated by [[C3 carbon fixation|C3 grasses]] (cool-season grasses) were established in the [[Central Great Plains]] by early late [[Arikareean]] (≥21.9 Million years ago), at least 4 million years prior to the emergence of hypsodonty in [[Equidae]].&lt;ref name="Stromberg2006"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Caroline A. E. Strömberg | year=2006 | title=Evolution of hypsodonty in equids: testing a hypothesis of adaptation | journal=Paleobiology | volume=32 | pages=236–258|url=http://depts.washington.edu/strmbrgl/StrombergLab_website/Publications_files/Stromberg_2006.pdf | doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2006)32[236:eohiet]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Mendoza and Palmqvist determined the relative importance of grass consumption and open habitat foraging in the development of hypsodont teeth using a dataset of 134 species of [[artiodactyl]]s and [[perissodactyl]]s. The results suggested that high-crowned teeth represent are adapted for a particular feeding environment, not diet preference. &lt;ref name="MendozaPalmqvist2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mendoza|first1=M.|last2=Palmqvist|first2=P.|title=Hypsodonty in ungulates: an adaptation for grass consumption or for foraging in open habitat?|journal=Journal of Zoology|date=February 2008|volume=274|issue=2|pages=134–142|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00365.x|url=http://webpersonal.uma.es/de/ppb/Hypsodonty%20in%20ungulates.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology===
Further, examination of mammalian teeth suggests that it is the open, gritty habitat and not the grass itself which is linked to diet changes.&lt;ref name="MendozaPalmqvist2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009"&gt;{{Citation | author=Billet, Blondel, and Muizon | title=Dental microwear analysis of notoungulates (Mammalia) from Salla (Late Oligocene, Bolivia) and discussion on their precocious hypsodonty| journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |year=2009|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of dental microwear patterns of hypsodont [[notoungulates]] from the Late Oligocene Salla Beds of Bolivia showed shearing movements are associated with a diet rich in tough plants, not necessarily grasses. That the relationship between high-crowned mammals and the source of tooth wear in the fossil record may not be straightforward, hence the spread of grasslands in South America, traditionally linked with the development of notoungulate hypsodonty, is in question.&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009" /&gt;

Observations of hypsodonty development in Cenozoic mammals is also supported by the evolution of hypsodonty in other groups. For example, [[hadrosaurs]], a group of herbivorous [[dinosaurs]], likely grazed on low-lying vegetation and microwear patterns show that their diet contained an abrasive material, such as grit or silica. Grasses had evolved by the Late Cretaceous, but were not particularly common, so this study concluded that grass probably did not play a major component in the hadrosaur's diet.&lt;ref name="AP0629"&gt;{{Citation  |title=Hadrosaur chowdown — grind, grind, grind |journal=Associated Press | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temporal Discontinuity===
Most importantly, evidence has shown, that the development of hypsodonty is out of sync with the flourishing of grasslands both in North America and South America, where grasslands spread 10 millions years earlier.&lt;ref name="jardine2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BilletBlondelMuizon2009"/&gt;

==Hypsodonty==
Hypsodonty is observed both in the fossil record and the modern world. It is a characteristic of large [[clades]] (equids) as well as subspecies level specialization. For example, the [[Sumatran rhinoceros]] and the [[Javan rhinoceros]] both have [[brachydont]], lophodont cheek teeth whereas the [[Indian rhinoceros]], has hypsodont dentition. A mammal may have exclusively hypsodont molars or have a mix of dentitions. Hypsodont dentition is characterized by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flynn|first1=John J.|last2=Wyss|first2=André R.|last3=Charrier|first3=Reynaldo|author-link3=Reynaldo Charrier|title=South America's Missing Mammals|journal=Scientific American|date=May 2007|volume=296|issue=5|pages=68–75|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0507-68|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v296/n5/full/scientificamerican0507-68.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kwan-Tufts"&gt;{{Cite web

'''Harry Underwood''' (1969) is a painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels. His pictures are painted with house paints and written upon with ordinary No. 2 pencils. His subjects are an eclectic mix of realism, surrealism, pop art and invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry has been labelled an [[outsider artist]], a pop artist, and a folk artist. However, unlike most folk artists, his paintings are carefully planned often taking months prior to their execution. One critic said of the detailed planning that goes into Harry's work that "what results is more a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of [[Edward Hopper]] meets [[Salvador Dali]] meets [[Andy Warhol]]."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parr-Moody |first1=Karen |title=Reveries of a Complicated Sign Painter |url=https://nashvillearts.com/2010/12/harry-underwood/ |website=Nashville Arts Magazine |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is popularly known by his first name "Harry", and distinctively signs his paintings with this moniker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nolan |first1=Joe |title=Harry Underwood at Estel Gallery |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/arts-culture/article/13017001/harry-underwood-at-estel-gallery |website=Nashville Scene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Harry Underwood was born in 1969 in Miami, FL. His father was a carpenter and his mother worked in a supermarket. His family was deeply religious and he attended the Church of God pentecostal church with them until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a teenager, Harry cleaned pools at motels and bussed tables at the Capri Italian Restaurant in Florida City, FL. He was uprooted by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in 1992 and spent time in Austin, TX and New Orleans, LA before settling in Nashville, TN where he found work in the construction industry. He began painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry's work is infused with romanticism and an undercurrent of nostalgia for a life not necessarily experienced, but wished for. Repeated images flesh out his work; bathing beauties, motel pools, vintage cars, commercial signs, palm trees, old bicycles, and dancing couples. There is a sense of mid-twentieth century Americana in his works which evokes nostalgia or longing for the vacation one never got to take, or the life one might have lived in the past, with touches of irony and commercialization that relate to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Harry Underwood |url=https://www.justfolk.com/product-category/outsider-art/underwood/ |website=Just Folk |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Harry first started painting in the early 2000s while working as a flooring installer and house painter in Nashville, TN. He discovered his color palette while going through half-used paint cans in the garage of a house at which he was working.

His first major solo show was titled "A Pictorial History of Wishful Thinking" and hosted by the Estel Gallery in Nashville, TN in 2007. Since then, his work has been exhibited at numerous leading galleries and institutions across the United States, United Kingdom, and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Harry Underwood |url=http://www.harryunderwood.com/about.html |website=HarryUnderwood.com |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Response to "Outsider Artist" Label ==

Though labeled an outsider artist, Harry avoids the term. When asked about it once by a University of North Carolina (Wilmington) researcher, he answered "I don’t think of that label as having anything to do with my vision or how I approach work each day. I don’t consider myself part of a movement. I wasn’t aware of artists like Darger or Edward Hopper until I was meeting people at my shows and they began telling me I reminded them of all that. Persistence is what making art is about. The world is designed to wreck your imagination. I don’t expect I’ll be tied to folk art forever. It wouldn’t be bad if I was. A friend recently called it “Americana,” and I kind of like that." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Louise Smith |first1=Emily |title=A Conversation with Harry Underwood |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/464134/pdf |website=John Hopkins University |publisher=University of North Carolina, Wilmington |accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pierre-Simon Laplace.jpg|thumb|250 px|[[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], one of the originators of the nebular hypothesis]]

The history of scientific thought about the [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System]] begins with the [[Copernican Revolution]].
The first recorded use of the term "Solar System" dates from 1704.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=etymoline|title=Solar|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=solar+system&amp;searchmode=none|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Webster's 9th New Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary view==
{{main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}
The most widely accepted theory of planetary formation, known as the [[nebular hypothesis]], maintains that 4.6 billion years ago, the Solar System formed from the gravitational collapse of a giant [[molecular cloud]] which was [[light year]]s across. Several [[star]]s, including the [[Sun]], formed within the collapsing cloud. The gas that formed the Solar System was slightly more massive than the Sun itself. Most of the mass collected in the centre, forming the Sun; the rest of the mass flattened into a [[protoplanetary disc]], out of which the [[planet]]s and other bodies in the Solar System formed.

There are, however, arguments against this hypothesis.

==Formation hypothesis==
French philosopher and mathematician [[René Descartes]] was the first to propose a model for the origin of the Solar System in his ''Le Monde'' (ou Traité de lumière) which he wrote in 1632 and 1633 and for which he delayed publication because of the Inquisition and it was published only after his death in 1664. In his view, the Universe was filled with vortices of swirling particles and the Sun and planets had condensed from a particularly large vortex that had somehow contracted, which explained the circular motion of the planets and was on the right track with condensation and contraction. However, this was before Newton's theory of gravity and we now know matter does not behave in this fashion.&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"&gt;Williams, I.O., Cremin, A.W. 1968. A survey of theories relating to the origin of the solar system. Qtly. Rev. RAS 9: 40–62. ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Artist's conception of a [[protoplanetary disc]]]]
The vortex model of 1944,&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; formulated by German physicist and philosopher Baron [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], which harkens back to the Cartesian model,  involved a pattern of turbulence-induced eddies in a Laplacian nebular disc. In it a suitable combination of clockwise rotation of each vortex and anti-clockwise rotation of the whole system can lead to individual elements moving around the central mass in Keplerian orbits so there would be little dissipation of energy due to the overall motion of the system but material would be colliding at high relative velocity in the inter-vortex boundaries and in these regions small roller-bearing eddies would coalesce to give annular condensations. It was much criticized as turbulence is a phenomenon associated with disorder and would not spontaneously produce the highly ordered structure required by the hypothesis. As well, it does not provide a solution to the angular momentum problem and does not explain lunar formation nor other very basic characteristics of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Woolfson|Woolfson, Michael Mark]], ''The Origin and Evolution of universe and the Solar System'', Taylor and Francis, 2000 ; completely considered that collision of the two suns produce the solar system and universe in the entire 100,00 years of the evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Weizsäcker model was modified&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; in 1948 by Dutch theoretical physicist Dirk Ter Haar, in that regular eddies were discarded and replaced by random turbulence which would lead to a very thick nebula where gravitational instability would not occur. He concluded the planets must have formed by accretion and explained the compositional difference (solid and liquid planets) as due to the temperature difference between the inner and outer regions, the former being hotter and the latter being cooler, so only refractories (non-volatiles) condensed in the inner region. A major difficulty is that in this supposition turbulent dissipation takes place in a time scale of only about a millennium which does not give enough time for planets to form.

The nebular hypothesis was first proposed in 1734 by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, Emanuel. 1734, (Principia) Latin: Opera Philosophica et Mineralia (English: Philosophical and Mineralogical Works), (Principia, Volume 1)&lt;/ref&gt;  and later elaborated and expanded upon by [[Immanuel Kant]] in 1755. A similar theory was independently formulated by [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1909| title= The Past History of the Earth as Inferred from the Mode of Formation of the Solar System| journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume=48 | pages=119 | author=See, T. J. J. |jstor=983817 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1749, [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] conceived the idea that the planets were formed when a comet collided with the Sun, sending matter out to form the planets. However, Laplace refuted this idea in 1796, showing that any planets formed in such a way would eventually crash into the Sun. Laplace felt that the near-circular orbits of the planets were a necessary consequence of their formation.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Today, comets are known to be far too small to have created the Solar System in this way.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Solar System: Its Origin and Evolution |author=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |quote=Physics Department, University of New York |journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=34 |pages=1–20 |date=1993 |bibcode=1993QJRAS..34....1W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1755, Immanuel Kant speculated that observed [[nebulae]] may in fact be regions of star and planet formation. In 1796, Laplace elaborated by arguing that the nebula collapsed into a star, and, as it did so, the remaining material gradually spun outward into a flat disc, which then formed the planets.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

===Alternative theories===
However plausible it may appear at first sight, the nebular hypothesis still faces the obstacle of [[angular momentum]]; if the Sun had indeed formed from the collapse of such a cloud, the planets should be rotating far more slowly. The Sun, though it contains almost 99.9 percent of the system's mass, contains just 1 percent of its angular momentum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Woolfson |first=Michael Mark |author-link=Michael Woolfson |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=313 |title=Rotation in the Solar System |issue=1524 |date=1984 |pages=5 |bibcode=1984RSPTA.313....5W |doi=10.1098/rsta.1984.0078 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the Sun should be spinning much more rapidly.

====Tidal theory====
Attempts to resolve the angular momentum problem led to the temporary abandonment of the nebular hypothesis in favour of a return to "two-body" theories.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; For several decades, many astronomers preferred the ''tidal'' or ''near-collision'' hypothesis put forward by [[James Jeans]] in 1917, in which the planets were considered to have been formed due to the approach of some other star to the Sun. This near-miss would have drawn large amounts of matter out of the Sun and the other star by their mutual [[tidal force]]s, which could have then condensed into planets.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; However, in 1929 astronomer [[Harold Jeffreys]] countered that such a near-collision was massively unlikely.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Objections to the hypothesis were also raised by the American astronomer [[Henry Norris Russell]], who showed that it ran into problems with [[angular momentum]] for the outer planets, with the planets struggling to avoid being reabsorbed by the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin Crowell|title=Conservation Laws|publisher=lightandmatter.com|date=1998–2006|chapter=5|url=http://www.lightandmatter.com/html_books/2cl/ch05/ch05.html|isbn=0-9704670-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Chamberlin-Moulton model====
Forest Moulton in 1900 had also shown that the nebular hypothesis was inconsistent with observations because of the angular momentum. Moulton and Chamberlin in 1904 originated the planetesimal hypothesis&lt;ref name="Sherrill, T.J 1999"&gt;Sherrill, T.J. 1999. A Career of Controversy: the Anomaly of T.J.J. See. J. Hist. Astrn. ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs/1999JHA.&lt;/ref&gt;(see [[Chamberlin–Moulton planetesimal hypothesis]]). Along with many astronomers of the day they came to believe the pictures of "spiral nebulas" from the Lick Observatory were direct evidence of forming solar systems. These turned out to be galaxies instead but the Shapley-Curtis debate about these was still 16 years in the future. One of the most fundamental issues in the history of astronomy was distinguishing between nebulas and galaxies.

Moulton and Chamberlin suggested that a star had passed close to the Sun early in its life to cause tidal bulges and that this, along with the internal process that leads to solar prominences,  resulted in the ejection of filaments of matter from both stars. While most of the material would have fallen back, part of it would remain in orbit. The filaments cooled into numerous, tiny, solid fragments, ‘planetesimals’, and a few larger protoplanets.  This model received favourable support for about 3 decades but passed out of favour by the late '30s and was discarded in the '40s by the realization it was incompatible with the angular momentum of Jupiter, but a part of it, planetesimal accretion, was retained.&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt;

====Lyttleton's scenario&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt;====
In 1937 and 1940, [[Raymond Arthur Lyttleton|Ray Lyttleton]] postulated that a companion star to the Sun collided with a passing star. Such a scenario was already suggested and rejected by Henry Russell in 1935. Lyttleton showed terrestrial planets were too small to condense on their own so suggested one very large proto-planet broke in two because of rotational instability, forming Jupiter and Saturn, with a connecting filament from which the other planets formed. A later model, from 1940 and 1941, involves a triple star system, a binary plus the Sun, in which the binary merges and later breaks up because of rotational instability and escapes from the system leaving a filament that formed between them to be captured by the Sun. Objections of Lyman Spitzer apply to this model also.

====Band-structure model====
In 1954, 1975, and 1978&lt;ref&gt;Alfvén, H. 1978. Band Structure of the Solar System. In Origin of the Solar System, S.F. Dermot, ed, pp. 41–48. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish astrophysicist Hannes  Alfvén included electromagnetic effects in equations of particle motions, and angular momentum distribution and compositional differences were explained. In 1954 he first proposed the band structure in which he distinguished an A-cloud, containing mostly helium, but with some solid- particle impurities ("meteor rain"), a B-cloud, with mostly hydrogen, a C-cloud, having mainly carbon, and a D-cloud, made mainly of silicon and iron. Impurities in the A-cloud form Mars and the Moon (later captured by Earth), in the B-cloud they condense into Mercury, Venus, and Earth, in the C-cloud they condense into the outer planets, and Pluto and Triton may have formed from the D-cloud.

====Interstellar cloud theory====
In 1943, the Soviet astronomer [[Otto Schmidt]] proposed that the Sun, in its present form, passed through a dense [[interstellar cloud]], emerging enveloped in a cloud of dust and gas, from which the planets eventually formed. This solved the angular momentum problem by assuming that the Sun's slow rotation was peculiar to it, and that the planets did not form at the same time as the Sun.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; Extensions of the model, together forming the Russian school, include Gurevich and Lebedinsky (in 1950), Safronov (in 1967,1969), Safronov and Vityazeff (in 1985), Safronov and Ruskol (in 1994), and Ruskol (in 1981), among others&lt;ref&gt;Williams, I.O., Cremin, A.W. 1968. A survey of theories relating to the origin of the solar system. Qtly. Rev. RAS 9: 40–62. ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this hypothesis was severely dented by [[Victor Safronov]] who showed that the amount of time required to form the planets from such a diffuse envelope would far exceed the Solar System's determined age.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

[[Raymond Arthur Lyttleton|Ray Lyttleton]] modified the theory by showing that a 3rd body was not necessary and proposing that a mechanism of line accretion described by Bondi and Hoyle in 1944 would enable cloud material to be captured by the star (Williams and Cremin, 1968, loc. cit.)

====Hoyle's hypothesis====
In this model&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; (from 1944) the companion went nova with ejected material captured by the Sun and planets forming from this material. In a version a year later it was a supernova.  In 1955 he proposed a similar system to Laplace, and with more mathematical detail in 1960. It differs from Laplace in that a magnetic torque occurs between the disk and the Sun, which comes into effect immediately or else more and more matter would be ejected resulting in a much too massive planetary system, one comparable to the Sun. The torque causes a magnetic coupling and acts to transfer angular momentum from the Sun to the disk. The magnetic field strength would have to be 1 gauss. The existence of torque depends on magnetic lines of force being frozen into the disk (a consequence of a well-known MHD (magnetohydrodynamic) theorem on frozen-in lines of force). As the solar condensation temperature when the disk was ejected could not be much more than 1000 degrees K., a number of refractories must be solid, probably as fine smoke particles, which would grow with condensation and accretion. These particles would be swept out with the disk only if their diameter at the Earth's orbit was less than 1 meter so as the disk moved outward a subsidiary disk consisting of only refractories remains behind where the terrestrial planets would form. The model is in good agreement with the mass and composition of the planets and angular momentum distribution provided the magnetic coupling is an acceptable idea, but not explained are twinning, the low mass of Mars and Mercury, and the planetoid belts. It was Alfvén who formulated the concept of frozen-in magnetic field lines.

====Kuiper's theory====
[[Gerard Kuiper]] (in 1944)&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; argued, like Ter Haar, that regular eddies would be impossible and postulated that large gravitational instabilities might occur in the solar nebula, forming condensations. In this, the solar nebula could be either co-genetic with the Sun or captured by it. Density distribution would determine what could form: either a planetary system or a stellar companion. The 2 types of planets were assumed to be due to the Roche limit. No explanation was offered for the Sun's slow rotation which Kuiper saw as a larger G-star problem.

====Whipple's theory====
In [[Fred Whipple]]'s 1948 scenario&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; a smoke cloud about 60,000 AU in diameter and with 1 [[solar mass]] ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) contracts and produces the Sun. It has a negligible angular momentum thus accounting for the Sun's similar property. This smoke cloud captures a smaller one with a large angular momentum. The collapse time for the large smoke and gas nebula is about 100 million years and the rate is slow at first, increasing in later stages. The planets would condense from small clouds developed in, or captured by, the 2nd cloud, the orbits would be nearly circular because accretion would reduce eccentricity due to the influence of the resisting medium, orbital orientations would be similar because the small cloud was originally small and the motions would be in a common direction. The protoplanets might have heated up to such high degrees that the more volatile compounds would have been lost and the orbital velocity decreases with increasing distance so that the terrestrial planets would have been more affected. The weaknesses of this scenario are that practically all the final regularities are introduced as a priori assumptions and most of the hypothesizing was not supported by quantitative calculations. For these reasons it did not gain wide acceptance.

====Urey's model====
American chemist [[Harold Urey]], who founded cosmochemistry, put forward a scenario&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; in 1951, 1952, 1956, and 1966 based largely on meteorites and using Chandrasekhar's stability equations and obtained density distribution in the gas and dust disk surrounding the primitive Sun. In order that volatile elements like mercury could be retained by the terrestrial planets he postulated a moderately thick gas and dust halo shielding the planets from the Sun. In order to form diamonds, pure carbon crystals, Moon-size objects, gas spheres that became gravitationally unstable, would have to form in the disk with the gas and dust dissipating at a later stage. Pressure fell as gas was lost and diamonds were converted to graphite, while the gas became illuminated by the Sun. Under these conditions considerable ionization would be present and the gas would be accelerated by magnetic fields, hence the angular momentum could be transferred from the Sun. He postulated that these lunar-size bodies were destroyed by collisions, with the gas dissipating, leaving behind solids collected at the core, with the resulting smaller fragments pushed far out into space and the larger fragments staying behind and accreting into planets. He suggested the Moon was just such a surviving core.

====Protoplanet theory====
In 1960, 1963, and 1978,&lt;ref&gt;McCrea, W. H.  1978.  The Formation of the Solar System: a Protoplanet Theory (Chp. 5). In: S.F. Dermot, Ed. Origin of the Solar System. John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William McCrea (astronomer)|W. H. McCrea]] proposed the ''protoplanet theory'', in which the Sun and planets individually coalesced from matter within the same cloud, with the smaller planets later captured by the Sun's larger gravity.&lt;ref name=history /&gt; It includes fission in a protoplanetary nebula and there is no solar nebula. Agglomerations of floccules (which are presumed to compose the supersonic turbulence assumed to occur in the interstellar material from which stars are born) formed the Sun and protoplanets, the latter splitting to form planets. The 2 portions can not remain gravitationally bound to each other,  are at a mass ratio of at least 8 to 1, and for inner planets they go into independent orbits while for outer planets one of the portions exits the Solar System. The inner protoplanets were Venus-Mercury and Earth-Mars. The moons of the greater planets were formed from "droplets" in the neck connecting the 2 portions of the dividing protoplanet and these droplets could account for some of the asteroids. Terrestrial planets would have no major moons which does not account for Luna.  It predicts certain observations such as the similar angular velocity of Mars and Earth with similar rotation periods and axial tilts. In this scheme there are 6 principal planets: 2 terrestrial, Venus and Earth, 2 major, Jupiter and Saturn, and 2 outer, Uranus and Neptune; and 3 lesser planets: Mercury, Mars, and Pluto.

This theory has a number of problems, such as explaining the fact that the planets all orbit the Sun in the same direction, which would appear highly unlikely if they were each individually captured.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;

====Cameron's hypothesis====
In American astronomer [[Alastair G. W. Cameron]]'s hypothesis (from 1962 and 1963),&lt;ref name="Williams, I.O. 1968"/&gt; the protosun has a mass of about 1–2 Suns with a diameter of around 100,000 AU is gravitationally unstable, collapses, and breaks up into smaller subunits. The magnetic field is of the order of 1/100,000 gauss. During the collapse the magnetic lines of force are twisted. The collapse is fast and is done by the dissociation of H molecules followed by the ionization of H and the double ionization of He. Angular momentum leads to rotational instability which produces a Laplacean disk.  At this stage radiation will remove excess energy and the disk will be quite cool in a relatively short period (about 1 mln. yrs.) and the condensation into what Whipple calls cometismals takes place. Aggregation of these produces giant planets which in turn produce disks during their formation from which evolve into lunar systems. The formation of terrestrial planets, comets, and asteroids involved disintegration, heating, melting, solidification, etc. He also formulated the Big Splat or Giant Impactor Hypothesis for the origin of the Moon.

====Capture theory====
The ''capture theory'', proposed by [[Michael Woolfson|Michael Mark Woolfson]] in 1964, posits that the Solar System formed from [[Tidal force|tidal]] interactions between the Sun and a low-density [[protostar]]. The Sun's gravity would have drawn material from the diffuse atmosphere of the protostar, which would then have collapsed to form the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The capture theory and planetary condensation |author1=J. R. Dormand |author2=Michael Mark Woolfson |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=151 |issue=3 |pages=307 |date=1971 |bibcode=1971MNRAS.151..307D |doi=10.1093/mnras/151.3.307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the capture theory predicts a different age for the Sun than for the planets,{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} whereas the similar ages of the Sun and the rest of the Solar System indicate that they formed at roughly the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Weidenschilling, S. J. |author2=Spaute, D. |author3=Davis, D. R. |author4=Marzari, F. |author5=Ohtsuki, K. |bibcode=1997Icar..128..429W |date=1997|title=Accretional Evolution of a Planetesimal Swarm|journal=Icarus | volume=128|issue=2 | pages=429–455 | doi=10.1006/icar.1997.5747}}&lt;!--I don't see where this paper supports this sentence (2008 April 17)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As captured planets would have initially eccentric orbits Dormand and Woolfson in 1974 and 1977 and Woolfson&lt;ref&gt;Woolfson, Michael Mark, "The Evolution of the solar system", in S. F. Dermot, Ed., ''Origin of the Solar System'', Wiley, New York (NY), 1978, pp.199–217&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the possibility of a collision.  A filament is thrown out by a passing proto-star which is captured by the Sun and planets form from it. In this there were 6 original planets, corresponding to 6 point-masses in the filament,  with planets A and B,  the 2 innermost, colliding, the former at twice the mass of Neptune, and ejecting out of the Solar System, and the latter at 1/3 the mass of Uranus, and splitting into Earth and Venus. Mars and the Moon are former moons of A. Mercury is either a fragment of B or an escaped moon of A. The collision also produced the asteroid belt and the comets.

T.J.J. See was an American astronomer and Navy Captain who at one time worked under Ellery Hale at the Lowell Observatory. He had a cult following largely because of his many (some 60) articles in ''Popular Astronomy'' but also in ''Astronomische Nachrichte'' (Astronomical News) (mostly in English). While at the USNO's Mare Island, Cal. station, he developed a model which he called capture theory, published in 1910, in his  "Researches on the Evolution of the Stellar Systems: v. 2. The capture theory of cosmical evolution, founded on dynamical principles and illustrated by phenomena observed in the spiral nebulae, the planetary system, the double and multiple stars and clusters and the star-clouds of the Milky Way",  which proposed that the planets formed in the outer Solar System and were captured by the Sun; the moons were formed in thus manner and were captured by the planets. This caused a feud with Forest Moulton, who co-developed the planetesimal hypothesis. A preview was presented in 1909 at a meeting of the ASP (Astronomical Society of the Pacific) at the Chabot Observatory in Oakland, Cal., and newspaper headlines blared "Prof. See's Paper Causes Sensation" (San Francisco Call) and "Scientists in Furore Over Nebulae" (San Francisco Examiner). Our current knowledge of dynamics makes capture most unlikely as it requires special conditions.&lt;ref name="Sherrill, T.J 1999"/&gt;

====Solar fission====
Swiss astronomer Louis Jacot (in 1951, 1962, 1981),&lt;ref&gt;Jacot, Louis. 1986. Heretical Cosmology (transl. of Science et bon sense, 1981). Exposition-Banner.&lt;/ref&gt; like Weisacker and Ter Haar, continued the Cartesian idea of vortices but proposed a hierarchy of vortices or vortices within vortices, i.e., a lunar system vortex, a Solar System vortex, and a galactic vortex.  He put forward the notion that planetary orbits are spirals, not circles or ellipses. Jacot also proposed the expansion of galaxies (stars move away from the hub),  and that moons move away from their planets.

He also maintained that planets were expelled, one at a time, from the Sun, specifically from an equatorial bulge caused by rotation, and that one of them shattered in this expulsion leaving the asteroid belt. The Kuiper Belt was unknown at the time, but presumably it, too, would be the result of the same kind of shattering. The moons, like the planets, originated as equatorial expulsions, but, of course,  from their parent planets, with some shattering, leaving the rings, and Earth is supposed to eventually expel another moon.

In this model there were 4 phases to the planets: no rotation and keeping the same side to the Sun "as Mercury does now" (we've known, of course, since 1965, that it doesn't),  very slow, accelerated, and finally, daily rotation.

He explained the differences between inner and outer planets and inner and outer moons through vortex behaviour. Mercury's eccentric orbit was explained by its recent expulsion from the Sun and Venus' slow rotation as its being in the "slow rotation phase", having been expelled second to last.

Bull. 17: 2–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MetaResearch ({{cite web |url=http://www.metaresearch.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527164707/http://metaresearch.org/ |archivedate=2008-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was first proposed in 1993 in the first edition of his book. In the revised version from 1999 and later, the original Solar System had 6 pairs of twin planets each fissioned off from the equatorial bulges of an overspinning Sun (outward centrifugal forces exceed the inward gravitational force) at different times so having different temperatures, sizes, and compositions, and having condensed thereafter with the nebular disk dissipating after some 100 million years, with 6 planets exploding. Four of these were helium dominated, fluid, and unstable (helium class planets). These were V (Bellatrix) (V standing for the 5th planet, the first 4 including Mercury and Mars), K (Krypton), T (transneptunian), and Planet X. In these cases, the smaller moons exploded because of tidal stresses leaving the 4 component belts of the 2 major planetoid zones.  Planet LHB-A, the explosion for which is postulated to have caused the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] (about 4 eons ago), was twinned with Jupiter, and LHB-B, the explosion for which is postulated to have caused another LHB, was twinned with Saturn. In planets LHB-A, Jupiter, LHB-B, and Saturn,  being gigantic, Jovian planets, the inner and smaller partner in each pair was subjected to enormous tidal stresses causing it to blow up. The explosions took place before they were able to fission off moons. As the 6 were fluid they left no trace. Solid planets fission off only one moon and Mercury was a moon of Venus but drifted away because of the Sun's gravitational influence. Mars was a moon of Bellatrix.
	
One major argument against exploding planets and moons is that there would not be an energy source powerful enough to cause such explosions. 
====Herndon's model====
In [[J. Marvin Herndon]]'s model,&lt;ref&gt;
Herndon, J. Marvin. 2013. New indivisible planetary science paradigm. ''Current Science'' 105: 450–461 (nuclearplanet.com).
&lt;/ref&gt;
inner (large-core) planets form by condensation and raining-out from within giant gaseous protoplanets at high pressures and high temperatures. Earth's complete condensation included a c. 300 Earth-mass gas/ice shell that compressed the rocky kernel to about 66% of Earth's present diameter (Jupiter equates to about 300 Earth masses, which equals c. 2000 trillion trillion kg; Earth is at about 6 trillion trillion kg). T Tauri (see [[T Tauri type stars]]) eruptions of the Sun stripped the gases away from the inner planets. Mercury was incompletely condensed and a portion of its gases were stripped away and transported to the region between Mars and Jupiter, where it fused with in-falling oxidized condensate from the outer reaches of the Solar System and formed the parent material for ordinary chondrite meteorites, the Main-Belt asteroids, and veneer for the inner planets, especially Mars.  The differences between the inner planets are primarily the consequence of different degrees of protoplanetary compression. There are two types of responses to decompression-driven planetary volume increases: cracks, which form to increase surface area, and folding, creating mountain ranges,  to accommodate changes in curvature.

This planetary formation theory represents an extension of the Whole-Earth Decompression Dynamics (WEDD) model,&lt;ref&gt;
For example: {{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
which includes natural nuclear-fission reactors in planetary cores; Herndon elaborates, expounds, and elucidates it in 11 articles in ''Current Science'' from 2005 to 2013 and in five books published from 2008 to 2012. He refers to his model as "indivisible" – meaning that the fundamental aspects of Earth are connected logically and causally, and can be deduced from its early formation as a Jupiter-like giant.

In 1944 the German chemist and physicist [[Arnold Eucken]] considered the thermodynamics of Earth condensing and raining-out within a giant protoplanet at pressures of 100–1000 atm. In the 1950s and early 1960s discussion of planetary formation at such pressures took place, but Cameron's 1963 low-pressure (c. 4–10 atm.) model largely supplanted the idea.

====Classification of the theories====
Jeans, in 1931,  divided the various models into 2 groups: those where the material for planet formation came from the Sun and those where it didn't and may be concurrent or consecutive.&lt;ref name="ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs"&gt;Williams, I.O., Cremin, A.W. 1968. A survey of theories relating to the origin of the solar system. Qtly. Rev. RAS 9: 40–62. [http://ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 	
	
William McCrea, in 1963, divided them into 2 groups also: those that relate the formation of the planets to the formation of the Sun and those where it is independent of the formation of the Sun, where the planets form after the Sun becomes a normal star.&lt;ref name="ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs"/&gt;

Ter Haar and Cameron&lt;ref&gt;Ter Haar, D. and Cameron, A.G.W. 1963. Historical Review of the Origin of the Solar System. In: Origin of the Solar System, Robert Jastrow and A. G. W. Cameron, eds., pp. 1–37. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished between those theories that consider a closed system, which is a development of the Sun and possibly a solar envelope, that starts with a protosun rather than the Sun itself, and state that Belot calls these theories monistic; and those that consider an open system, which is where there is an interaction between the Sun and some foreign body that is supposed to have been the first step in the developments leading to the planetary system, and state that Belot calls these theories dualistic.

Hervé Reeves' classification&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, H. 1978. Origin of the Solar System. In: The Origin of the Solar System, S.F. Dermott, ed., pp. 1–18. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;  also categorizes them as co-genetic with the Sun or not but also as formed from altered or unaltered stellar/interstellar material. He as well recognizes 4 groups:  1) models based on the solar nebula, originated by Swedenborg, Kant, and Laplace in the 1700s; 2) the ones proposing a cloud captured from interstellar space, major proponents being Alfvén and Gustaf Arrhenius (in 1978) and Alfvén and Arrhenius; 3) the binary hypotheses which propose that a sister star somehow disintegrated and a portion of its dissipating material was captured by the Sun, principal hypothesizer being Lyttleton in the '40s; 4) and the close-approach-filament ideas of Jeans, Jeffreys, and Woolfson and Dormand.

In Williams and Cremin&lt;ref name="ads.abs.harvard.edu/abs"/&gt; the categories are: (1) models that regard the origin and formation of the planets as being essentially related to the Sun, with the 2 formation processes taking place concurrently or consecutively, (2) models that regard formation of the planets as being independent of the formation process of the Sun, the planets forming after the Sun becomes a normal star; this has 2 subcategories: a) where the material for the formation of the planets is extracted either from the Sun or another star, b) where the material is acquired from interstellar space. They conclude that the best models are Hoyle's magnetic coupling and McCrea's floccules.

Woolfson&lt;ref&gt;Woolfson, Michael Mark, ''The Origin and Evolution of the Solar System'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; recognized 1) monistic, which included Laplace, Descartes, Kant, and Weisacker, and 2) dualistc, which included Leclerc (comte de Buffon), Chamberlin-Moulton, Jeans, Jeffreys, and Schmidt-Lyttleton.

===Reemergence of the nebular hypothesis===
[[File:HST betaPictoris comb.jpg|thumb|200 px|left|Beta Pictoris seen by the Hubble Space Telescope]]
In 1978, astronomer A. J. R. Prentice revived the Laplacian nebular model in his Modern Laplacian Theory by suggesting that the angular momentum problem could be resolved by drag created by dust grains in the original disc which slowed down the rotation in the centre.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Prentice, A.

The birth of the modern widely accepted theory of planetary formation—the Solar Nebular Disk Model (SNDM)—can be traced to the works of Soviet astronomer [[Victor Safronov]].&lt;ref name=NewScientist&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/solar-system/comets-asteroids/mg13117837.100|title=Birth of the planets: The Earth and its fellow planets may be survivors from a time when planets ricocheted around the Sun like ball bearings on a pinball table|publisher=New Scientist|author=Nigel Henbest|date=1991|accessdate=2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Evolution of the protoplanetary cloud and formation of the Earth and the planets'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Viktor Sergeevich | last=Safronov | title= Evolution of the Protoplanetary Cloud and Formation of the Earth and the Planets | isbn= 0-7065-1225-1 | date=1972 | publisher=Israel Program for Scientific Translations }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was translated to English in 1972, had a long-lasting effect on the way scientists thought about the formation of the planets.&lt;ref name=Safronov&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1989Metic..24..347W|title=Leonard Medal Citation for Victor Sergeevich Safronov|journal=Meteoritics|author=George W.

Safronov's ideas were further developed in the works of [[George Wetherill]], who discovered ''runaway accretion''.&lt;ref name=history/&gt; By the early 1980s, the nebular hypothesis in the form of SNDM had come back into favour, led by two major discoveries in astronomy. First, a number of apparently young stars, such as [[Beta Pictoris]], were found to be surrounded by discs of cool dust, much as was predicted by the nebular hypothesis. Second, the [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite]], launched in 1983, observed that many stars had an [[infrared excess|excess of infrared radiation]] that could be explained if they were orbited by discs of cooler material.

===Outstanding issues===
While the broad picture of the nebular hypothesis is widely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;e. g.

The refined nebular model was developed entirely on the basis of observations of the Solar System because it was the only one known until the mid-1990s. It was not confidently assumed to be widely applicable to other [[planetary systems]], although scientists were anxious to test the nebular model by finding of protoplanetary discs or even planets around other stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory|title=Planet Quest, Terrestrial Planet Finder|url=http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/tpf_signsOfLife.cfm|accessdate=2008-02-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208051041/http://planetquest.jpl.nasa.gov/TPF/tpf_signsOfLife.cfm|archivedate=2008-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of August 30, 2013, the discovery of 941 [[extrasolar planet]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean Schneider|url=http://exoplanet.eu|title= The extrasolar planets encyclopedia|work=Paris University|accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; has turned up many surprises, and the nebular model must be revised to account for these discovered planetary systems, or new models considered.

Among the extrasolar planets discovered to date are planets the size of Jupiter or larger but possessing very short orbital periods of only a few hours. Such planets would have to orbit very closely to their stars; so closely that their atmospheres would be gradually stripped away by solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Weaver, D. |author2=Villard, R. | url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2007/07/full/ | title=Hubble Probes Layer-cake Structure of Alien World's Atmosphere | work=University of Arizona, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory (Press Release) | date=2007-01-31 | accessdate=2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=Nature | last=Ballester | first=Gilda E. |author2=Sing, David K. |author3=Herbert, Floyd  | title=The signature of hot hydrogen in the atmosphere of the extrasolar planet HD 209458b | volume=445 | pages=511–4 | date=2007 | doi=10.1038/nature05525 | pmid=17268463 | issue=7127|bibcode = 2007Natur.445..511B }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consensus on how to explain these so-called [[hot Jupiters]], but one leading idea is that of [[planetary migration]], similar to the process which is thought to have moved Uranus and Neptune to their current, distant orbit.

The detailed features of the planets are another problem. The solar nebula hypothesis predicts that all planets will form exactly in the ecliptic plane. Instead, the orbits of the [[classical planets]] have various (but small) inclinations with respect to the ecliptic. Furthermore, for the gas giants it is predicted that their rotations and moon systems will also not be inclined with respect to the ecliptic plane. However, most gas giants have substantial axial tilts with respect to the ecliptic, with [[Uranus]] having a 98° tilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apl.ucl.ac.uk/iopw/uworkshop_060905.pdf|title=Uranus nears Equinox|author=Heidi B.

It is now believed these observations are explained by events which happened after the initial formation of the Solar System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nineplanets.org/origin.html|title=The Origin of the Solar System|work=Colorado University, Boulder|author=Frank Crary|date=1998|accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar evolution hypotheses==
Attempts to isolate the physical source of the Sun's energy, and thus determine when and how it might ultimately run out, began in the 19th century. At that time, the prevailing scientific view on the source of the Sun's heat was that it was generated by [[gravitational contraction]]. In the 1840s, astronomers J. R. Mayer and J. J. Waterson first proposed that the Sun's massive weight causes it to collapse in on itself, generating heat, an idea expounded upon in 1854 by both [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] and [[Lord Kelvin]], who further elaborated on the idea by suggesting that heat may also be produced by the impact of meteors onto the Sun's surface.&lt;ref name=david&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sun: A Biography|author=David Whitehouse|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-470-09296-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Sun only has enough [[gravitational potential energy]] to power its [[luminosity]] by this mechanism for about 30&amp;nbsp;million years—far less than the age of the Earth. (This collapse time is known as the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism|Kelvin–Helmholtz timescale]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Carl J. Hansen |author2=Steven D. Kawaler |author3=Virginia Trimble | title=Stellar interiors: physical principles, structure, and evolution | date=2004 | publisher=Springer | location=New York  | isbn=0-387-20089-4 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]]'s development of the [[theory of relativity]] in 1905 led to the understanding that nuclear reactions could create new elements from smaller precursors, with the loss of energy. In his treatise ''Stars and Atoms'', [[Arthur Eddington]] suggested that pressures and temperatures within stars were great enough for hydrogen nuclei to fuse into helium; a process which could produce the massive amounts of energy required to power the Sun.&lt;ref name=david/&gt; In 1935, Eddington went further and suggested that other elements might also form within stars.&lt;ref name=hoyle&gt;{{cite book|title=Fred Hoyle: A Life in Science|author=Simon Mitton|publisher=Aurum|date=2005|chapter=Origin of the Chemical Elements|pages=197–222|isbn=0-309-09313-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectral evidence collected after 1945 showed that the distribution of the commonest chemical elements, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, neon, iron etc., was fairly uniform across the galaxy. This suggested that these elements had a common origin.&lt;ref name=hoyle /&gt; A number of anomalies in the proportions hinted at an underlying mechanism for creation. Lead has a higher atomic weight than gold, but is far more common. Hydrogen and helium (elements 1 and 2) are virtually ubiquitous yet lithium and beryllium (elements 3 and 4) are extremely rare.&lt;ref name=hoyle /&gt;

===Red giants===
{{main|Red giant}}
While the unusual spectra of red giant stars had been known since the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=s process in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars|author1=Oscar Straniero |author2=Roberto Gallino |author3=Sergio Cristallo |journal=Nuclear Physics A|volume=777 |date= 17 October 2006|pages= 311–339|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2005.01.011|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037594740500028X|arxiv = astro-ph/0501405 |bibcode = 2006NuPhA.777..311S }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was [[George Gamow]] who, in the 1940s, first understood that they were stars of roughly solar mass that had run out of hydrogen in their cores and had resorted to burning the hydrogen in their outer shells.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} This allowed [[Martin Schwarzschild]] to draw the connection between red giants and the finite lifespans of stars. It is now understood that red giants are stars in the last stages of their life cycles.

[[Fred Hoyle]] noted that, even while the distribution of elements was fairly uniform, different stars had varying amounts of each element. To Hoyle, this indicated that they must have originated within the stars themselves. The abundance of elements peaked around the atomic number for iron, an element that could only have been formed under intense pressures and temperatures. Hoyle concluded that iron must have formed within giant stars.&lt;ref name=hoyle /&gt; From this, in 1945 and 1946, Hoyle constructed the final stages of a star's life cycle. As the star dies, it collapses under its own weight, leading to a stratified chain of fusion reactions: carbon-12 fuses with helium to form oxygen-16; oxygen-16 fuses with helium to produce neon-20, and so on up to iron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fred Hoyle, Red Giants and beyond|author=J. Faulkner|bibcode=2003Ap&amp;SS.285..339F|journal=Astrophysics and Space Science|volume=285|issue=2|pages= 339–339|date=2003|doi=10.1023/A:1025432324828}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was, however, no known method by which carbon-12 could be produced. Isotopes of beryllium produced via fusion were too unstable to form carbon, and for three helium atoms to form carbon-12 was so unlikely as to have been impossible over the age of the Universe. However, in 1952 the physicist [[Ed Salpeter]] showed that a short enough time existed between the formation and the decay of the beryllium isotope that another helium had a small chance to form carbon, but only if their combined mass/energy amounts were equal to that of carbon-12. Hoyle, employing the [[anthropic principle]], showed that it must be so, since he himself was made of carbon, and he existed. When the matter/energy level of carbon-12 was finally determined, it was found to be within a few percent of Hoyle's prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life, Bent Chains, and the Anthropic Principle|author=The Nuclear Physics Group|work=The University of Birmingham|url=http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm|accessdate=2008-04-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812061136/http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm |archivedate=2007-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White dwarfs===
{{main|White dwarf}}
The first white dwarf discovered was in the [[triple star system]] of [[40 Eridani]], which contains the relatively bright [[main sequence]] star [[40 Eridani A]], orbited at a distance by the closer [[binary star|binary system]] of the white dwarf [[40 Eridani B]] and the [[main sequence]] [[red dwarf]] [[40 Eridani C]]. The pair 40 Eridani B/C was discovered by [[William Herschel]] on January 31, 1783;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/106749 Catalogue of Double Stars], William Herschel, ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' '''75''' (1785), pp. 40–126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;, p.&amp;nbsp;73&lt;/sup&gt; it was again observed by [[Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve]] in 1825 and by [[Otto Wilhelm von Struve]] in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1926BAN.....3..128V The orbit and the masses of 40 Eridani BC], W. H. van den Bos, ''Bulletin of the Astronomical Institutes of the Netherlands'' '''3''', #98 (July 8, 1926), pp. 128–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974AJ.....79..819H Astrometric study of four visual binaries], W. D. Heintz, ''Astronomical Journal'' '''79''', #7 (July 1974), pp. 819–825.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1910, it was discovered by [[Henry Norris Russell]], [[Edward Charles Pickering]] and [[Williamina Paton Stevens Fleming|Williamina Fleming]] that despite being a dim star, 40 Eridani B was of [[stellar classification|spectral type]] A, or white.&lt;ref name="holberg"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005AAS...20720501H How Degenerate Stars Came to be Known as White Dwarfs], J. B. Holberg, ''Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society'' '''37''' (December 2005), p. 1503.&lt;/ref&gt;

White dwarfs were found to be extremely dense soon after their discovery. If a star is in a [[binary star|binary]] system, as is the case for Sirius B and 40 Eridani B, it is possible to estimate its mass from observations of the binary orbit. This was done for Sirius B by 1910,&lt;ref&gt;''Preliminary General Catalogue'', L. Boss, Washington, D.C.: Carnegie Institution, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; yielding a mass estimate of {{Solar mass|0.94|link=y}}.  (A more modern estimate is {{Solar mass|1.00}}.)&lt;ref name="apj_630"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/w2005ApJ...630L..69L The Age and Progenitor Mass of Sirius B], James Liebert, Patrick A. Young, David Arnett, J. B. Holberg, and Kurtis A. Williams, ''The Astrophysical Journal'' '''630''', #1 (September 2005), pp. L69–L72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since hotter bodies radiate more than colder ones, a star's surface brightness can be estimated from its [[effective temperature|effective surface temperature]], and hence from its [[spectrum]]. If the star's distance is known, its overall luminosity can also be estimated. Comparison of the two figures yields the star's radius. Reasoning of this sort led to the realization, puzzling to astronomers at the time, that Sirius B and 40 Eridani B must be very dense. For example, when [[Ernst Öpik]] estimated the density of a number of visual binary stars in 1916, he found that 40 Eridani B had a density of over 25,000 times the [[Sun]]'s, which was so high that he called it "impossible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1916ApJ....44..292O The Densities of Visual Binary Stars], E. Öpik, ''The Astrophysical Journal'' '''44''' (December 1916), pp. 292–302.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such densities are possible because white dwarf material is not composed of [[atom]]s bound by [[chemical bond]]s, but rather consists of a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of unbound [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[electron]]s. There is therefore no obstacle to placing nuclei closer to each other than [[atomic orbital|electron orbital]]s—the regions occupied by electrons bound to an atom—would normally allow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1924MNRAS..84..308E On the relation between the masses and luminosities of the stars], A. S. Eddington, ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''84''' (March 1924), pp. 308–332.&lt;/ref&gt; Eddington, however, wondered what would happen when this plasma cooled and the energy which kept the atoms ionized was no longer present.&lt;ref name="fowler"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1926MNRAS..87..114F On Dense Matter], R. H. Fowler, ''Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society'' '''87''' (1926), pp. 114–122.&lt;/ref&gt;  This paradox was resolved by [[R. H. Fowler]] in 1926 by an application of the newly devised [[quantum mechanics]]. Since electrons obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no two electrons can occupy the same [[quantum state|state]], and they must obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], also introduced in 1926 to determine the statistical distribution of particles which satisfy the Pauli exclusion principle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2990270 The Development of the Quantum Mechanical Electron Theory of Metals: 1900–28], Lillian H. Hoddeson and G. Baym, ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences'' '''371''', #1744 (June 10, 1980), pp. 8–23.&lt;/ref&gt;  At zero temperature, therefore, electrons could not all occupy the lowest-energy, or ''[[ground state|ground]]'', state; some of them had to occupy higher-energy states, forming a band of lowest-available energy states, the ''[[Fermi sea]]''. This state of the electrons, called ''[[degenerate matter|degenerate]]'', meant that a white dwarf could cool to zero temperature and still possess high energy.

===Planetary nebulae===
{{main|Planetary nebula}}
&lt;!---[[File:NGC7293 (2004).jpg|thumb|150px|left|NGC 7293, [[Helix Nebula]]]]---&gt;
Planetary nebulae are generally faint objects, and none are visible to the [[naked eye]]. The first planetary nebula discovered was the [[Dumbbell Nebula]] in the constellation of [[Vulpecula]], observed by [[Charles Messier]] in 1764 and listed as M27 in his [[Messier object|catalogue]] of nebulous objects. To early observers with low-resolution telescopes, M27 and subsequently discovered planetary nebulae somewhat resembled the gas giants, and [[William Herschel]], discoverer of [[Uranus]], eventually coined the term 'planetary nebula' for them, although, as we now know, they are very different from planets.

The central stars of planetary nebulae are very hot. Their [[luminosity]], though, is very low, implying that they must be very small. Only once a star has exhausted all its nuclear fuel can it collapse to such a small size, and so planetary nebulae came to be understood as a final stage of stellar evolution. Spectroscopic observations show that all planetary nebulae are expanding, and so the idea arose that planetary nebulae were caused by a star's outer layers being thrown into space at the end of its life.

==Lunar origins hypotheses==
{{main|Geology of the Moon#Formation}}
[[File:George Darwin sepia tone.jpg|thumb|George Darwin]]
Over the centuries, many scientific hypotheses have been advanced concerning the origin of [[Moon|Earth's Moon]]. One of the earliest was the so-called ''[[Geology of the Moon#Co-accretion hypothesis|binary accretion model]]'', which concluded that the Moon accreted from material in orbit around the Earth left over from its formation. Another, the ''[[Geology of the Moon#Fission hypothesis|fission model]]'', was developed by [[George Darwin]] (son of [[Charles Darwin]]), who noted that, as the Moon is gradually receding from the Earth at a rate of about 4&amp;nbsp;cm per year, so at one point in the distant past it must have been part of the Earth, but was flung outward by the momentum of Earth's then–much faster rotation. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that the Moon's density, while less than Earth's, is about equal to that of Earth's rocky [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], suggesting that, unlike the Earth, it lacks a dense iron core. A third hypothesis, known as the ''[[lunar capture|capture model]]'', suggested that the Moon was an independently orbiting body that had been snared into orbit by Earth's gravity.&lt;ref name=moon&gt;{{cite book|title=The Once and Future Moon|author=Paul D. Spudis|chapter=Whence the Moon?|pages=157–169|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|date=1996|isbn=0-522-84826-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Apollo'' missions===
However, these hypotheses were all refuted by the late 1960s and early 1970s ''[[Apollo program|Apollo]]'' lunar missions, which introduced a stream of new scientific evidence; specifically concerning the Moon's composition, its age, and its history. These lines of evidence contradict many predictions made by these earlier models.&lt;ref name=moon /&gt; The rocks brought back from the Moon showed a marked decrease in water relative to rocks elsewhere in the Solar System, and also evidence of an ocean of magma early in its history, indicating that its formation must have produced a great deal of energy. Also, oxygen [[isotope]]s in lunar rocks showed a marked similarity to those on Earth, suggesting that they formed at a similar location in the solar nebula. The capture model fails to explain the similarity in these isotopes (if the Moon had originated in another part of the Solar System, those isotopes would have been different), while the co-accretion model cannot adequately explain the loss of water (if the Moon formed in a similar fashion to the Earth, the amount of water trapped in its mineral structure would also be roughly similar). Conversely, the fission model, while it can account for the similarity in chemical composition and the lack of iron in the Moon, cannot adequately explain its high orbital inclination and, in particular, the large amount of angular momentum in the Earth–Moon system, more than any other planet–satellite pair in the Solar System.&lt;ref name=moon /&gt;

===Giant impact hypothesis===
{{main|Giant impact hypothesis}}
For many years after ''Apollo'', the binary accretion model was settled on as the best hypothesis for explaining the Moon's origins, even though it was known to be flawed. Then, at a conference in Kona, Hawaii in 1984, a compromise model was composed that accounted for all of the observed discrepancies. Originally formulated by two independent research groups in 1976, the ''giant impact'' model supposed that a massive planetary object, the size of Mars, had collided with Earth early in its history. The impact would have melted Earth's crust, and the other planet's heavy core would have sunk inward and merged with Earth's. The superheated vapour produced by the impact would have risen into orbit around the planet, coalescing into the Moon. This explained the lack of water (the vapour cloud was too hot for water to condense), the similarity in composition (since the Moon had formed from part of the Earth), the lower density (since the Moon had formed from the Earth's crust and mantle, rather than its core), and the Moon's unusual orbit (since an oblique strike would have imparted a massive amount of angular momentum to the Earth–Moon system).&lt;ref name=moon /&gt;

===Outstanding issues===
However, the giant impact model has been criticised for being too explanatory; it can be expanded to explain any future discoveries and as such, is unfalsifiable. Also, many claim that much of the material from the impactor would have ended up in the Moon, meaning that the isotope levels would be different, but they are not. Also, while some volatile compounds such as water are absent from the Moon's crust, many others, such as manganese, are not.&lt;ref name=moon/&gt;

===Other natural satellites===
While the co-accretion and capture models are not currently accepted as valid explanations for the existence of the Moon, they have been employed to explain the formation of other natural satellites in the Solar System. [[Jupiter]]'s [[Galilean satellites]] are believed to have formed via co-accretion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Formation of the Galilean Satellites: Conditions of Accretion|author1=Robin M. Canup |author2=William R. Ward |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1538-3881/124/6/3404/|date=2002|volume=124|issue=6|pages= 3404–3423|doi= 10.1086/344684|accessdate=2008-04-22|journal=The Astronomical Journal|bibcode=2002AJ....124.3404C}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Solar System's [[irregular satellites]], such as [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], are all believed to have been captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Capture of Irregular Satellites during Planetary Encounters|author1=David Nesvorný |author2=David Vokrouhlický |author3=Alessandro Morbidelli |url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1538-3881/133/5/1962|date=2007 |journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=133|issue=5|pages= 1962–1976|doi= 10.1086/512850|accessdate=2008-04-22|bibcode=2007AJ....133.1962N}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leigh Marine Laboratory''' is the marine research facility for the [[University of Auckland]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home Leigh Marine Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratory is situated in north eastern New Zealand, {{convert|100|km}} north of Auckland city. The facility is perched on the cliffs overlooking the Goat Island marine reserve that covers {{convert|5|km}} of coastline from Cape Rodney to Okakari Point. The laboratory provides the facilities to support a wide range of field based research, including overnight field trips for undergraduate students and for postgraduate students to live on campus. The laboratory has a fleet of small boats, including a {{convert|15|m}} long [[research vessel]], ''Hawere''.

==History==

Leigh Marine Laboratory was opened in 1964 in the small coastal community of [[Leigh, New Zealand|Leigh]]. The first director of the marine laboratory, [[Bill Ballantine (biologist)|Bill Ballantine]] was instrumental in the establishment of the adjacent [[Goat Island marine reserve]] in 1975, the first [[Marine reserves of New Zealand|marine protected area in New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine-reserves.org.nz/pages/ballintine.html Dr Bill Ballantine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724200559/http://www.marine-reserves.org.nz/pages/ballintine.html |date=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009 a major redevelopment of the Leigh Marine Laboratory began with  new facilities being opened in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/for/future-undergraduates/facilities-and-resources/fu-science-building-at-leigh-marine new facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; The new facilities included a new accommodation and workshop building, a three story research building and an interpretive educational centre for public visitors.

==Research==

A wide range of research activities are undertaken at the laboratory, including marine [[biogeography]], [[physiology]], [[ecology]], [[genetics]], [[Fisheries science|marine fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]]. The laboratory has nine academic staff on site, with seven support staff. Further academic staff from the main University of Auckland campus are also frequent users of the laboratory. Postgraduate research is a major feature of the Leigh Laboratory with more than 400 marine science theses produced from the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marine.auckland.ac.nz/uoa/home/about/our-research Postgraduate research]&lt;/ref&gt;

An important part of research at the Leigh Marine Laboratory is supporting the development of [[aquaculture in New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquaculture.govt.nz/ aquaculture in New Zealand]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a strong focus on the development of new aquaculture species, including [[spiny lobster]]s, [[sea cucumber]]s, [[New Zealand sea urchin|sea urchins]], and various fin fish species. In addition, research is undertaken on improving the production and sustainability of existing [[Aquaculture in New Zealand|important aquaculture species]], such as [[abalone]], [[New Zealand green-lipped mussel|mussels]] and [[Tiostrea chilensis|oysters]].

== Stevens's typology ==
=== Overview ===
Stevens proposed his typology in a 1946 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article titled "On the theory of scales of measurement".&lt;ref name="Stevens 1946"/&gt; In that article, Stevens claimed that all [[measurement]] in science was conducted using four different types of scales that he called "nominal," "ordinal," "interval," and "ratio," unifying both "[[Qualitative property|qualitative]]" (which are described by his "nominal" type) and "[[Quantitative property|quantitative]]" (to a different degree, all the rest of his scales). The concept of scale types later received the mathematical rigour that it lacked at its inception with the work of mathematical psychologists Theodore Alper (1985, 1987), Louis Narens (1981a, b), and [[R. Duncan Luce]] (1986, 1987, 2001). As Luce (1997, p.&amp;nbsp;395) wrote:
{{quote|S. S. Stevens (1946, 1951, 1975) claimed that what counted was having an interval or ratio scale. Subsequent research has given meaning to this assertion, but given his attempts to invoke scale type ideas it is doubtful if he understood it himself&amp;nbsp;... no measurement theorist I know accepts Stevens's broad definition of measurement&amp;nbsp;... in our view, the only sensible meaning for 'rule' is empirically testable laws about the attribute.}}

==== Comparison ====
To give a better overview the values in 'Mathematical Operators', 'Advanced operations' and 'Central tendency' are only the ones this level of measurement introduces. The complete list includes the values of previous levels. This is inverted for the 'Measure property'.

=== Nominal level ===
The nominal type differentiates between items or subjects based only on their names or (meta-)categories and other qualitative classifications they belong to; thus dichotomous data involves the [[Constructivist epistemology|construction of classifications]] as well as the classification of items. Discovery of an exception to a classification can be viewed as progress. Numbers may be used to represent the variables but the numbers do not have numerical value or relationship:  for example, a [[globally unique identifier]].

Examples of these classifications include gender, nationality, ethnicity, language, genre, style, biological species, and form.&lt;ref&gt;Nominal measures are based on sets and  depend on categories, a la Aristotle: {{cite web |url=http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/gmartin/geog476/Lecture/BeySt.htm |title=Beyond Stevens: A revised approach to measurement for geographic information |first=Nicholas |last=Chrisman |date=March 1995 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Invariably one came up against fundamental physical limits to the accuracy of measurement. ... The art of physical measurement seemed to be a matter of compromise, of choosing between reciprocally related uncertainties. ...  Multiplying together the conjugate pairs of uncertainty limits mentioned, however, I found that they formed invariant products of not one but two distinct kinds. ... The first group of limits were calculable ''a priori'' from a specification of the instrument. The second group could be calculated only ''a posteriori'' from a specification of what was ''done'' with the instrument. ... In the first case each unit [of information] would add one additional ''dimension'' (conceptual category), whereas in the second each unit would add one additional ''atomic fact''.", – pp. 1–4: MacKay, Donald M. (1969), ''Information, Mechanism, and Meaning'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-63-032-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a university one could also use hall of affiliation as an example. Other concrete examples are 
* in [[grammar]], the [[parts of speech]]: noun, verb, preposition, article, pronoun, etc.
* in politics, [[power projection]]: hard power, soft power, etc.
* in biology, the [[taxonomic rank]]s below domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya
* in [[software engineering]], type of [[Trap (computing)|faults]]: specification faults, design faults, and code faults

Nominal scales were often called qualitative scales, and measurements made on qualitative scales were called qualitative data. However, the rise of qualitative research has made this usage confusing. The numbers in nominal measurement are assigned as labels and have no specific numerical value or meaning. No form of arithmetic computation (+,&amp;nbsp;−,&amp;nbsp;×,&amp;nbsp;etc.) may be performed on nominal measures. The nominal level is the lowest measurement level  used from a statistical point of view.

====Mathematical operations====
[[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] and other operations that can be defined in terms of equality, such as [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] and [[set membership]], are the only [[non-trivial]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s that generically apply to objects of the nominal type.

====Central tendency====
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], i.e. the ''most common'' item, is allowed as the measure of [[central tendency]] for the nominal type. On the other hand, the [[median]], i.e. the ''middle-ranked'' item, makes no sense for the nominal type of data since ranking is meaningless for the nominal type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Manikandan|first1=S.|title=Measures of central tendency: Median and mode|journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics|date=2011|volume=2|issue=3|pages=214–5|doi=10.4103/0976-500X.83300|pmc=3157145|pmid=21897729}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinal scale===
{{anchor |Ordinal scale}}&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[IQ classification]] and other articles --&gt;
{{further|Ordinal data}}

The ordinal type allows for [[rank order]] (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) by which data can be sorted, but still does not allow for relative ''degree of difference'' between them. Examples include, on one hand, '''dichotomous''' data with dichotomous (or dichotomized) values such as 'sick' vs. 'healthy' when measuring health, 'guilty' vs. 'not-guilty' when making judgments in courts, 'wrong/false' vs. 'right/true' when measuring [[truth value]], and, on the other hand, '''non-dichotomous''' data consisting of a spectrum of values, such as 'completely agree', 'mostly agree', 'mostly disagree', 'completely disagree' when measuring [[opinion]].

; Central tendency
The [[median]], i.e. ''middle-ranked'', item is allowed as the measure of [[central tendency]]; however, the mean (or average) as the measure of [[central tendency]] is not allowed. The [[mode (statistics)|mode]] is allowed.

In 1946, Stevens observed that psychological measurement, such as measurement of opinions, usually operates on ordinal scales; thus means and standard deviations have no [[Validity (logic)|validity]], but they can be used to get ideas for how to improve [[operationalization]] of variables used in [[questionnaire]]s. Most psychological data collected by [[psychometric]] instruments and tests, measuring [[cognitive]] and other abilities, are ordinal, although some theoreticians have argued they can be treated as interval or ratio scales. However, there is little [[prima facie]] evidence to suggest that such attributes are anything more than ordinal (Cliff, 1996; Cliff &amp; Keats, 2003; Michell, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite book |title=Statistical Theories of Mental Test Scores |last1=Lord |first1=Frederic M. |last2=Novick |first2=Melvin R. |last3=Birnbaum |first3=Allan |year=1968 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading (MA) |lccn=68011394 |laysummary=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1162101 |laydate=24 June 2013 |page=21 |quote=Although, formally speaking, interval measurement can always be obtained by specification, such specification is theoretically meaningful only if it is implied by the theory and model relevant to the measurement procedure. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Parametric and Nonparametric Statistical Procedures |last=Sheskin |first=David J. |year=2007 |edition=Fourth |publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC |location=Boca Raton (FL) |isbn=978-1-58488-814-7 |page=3 |laysummary=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781584888147 |laydate=27 July 2010 |quote=Although in practice IQ and most other human characteristics measured by psychological tests (such as anxiety, introversion, self esteem, etc.) are treated as interval scales, many researchers would argue that they are more appropriately categorized as ordinal scales.

===Interval scale===
The interval type allows for the ''degree of difference'' between items, but not the ratio between them. Examples include ''temperature'' with the [[degree Celsius|Celsius scale]], which has two defined points (the freezing and boiling point of water at specific conditions) and then separated into 100 intervals, ''date'' when measured from an arbitrary epoch (such as AD), ''percentage'' such as a percentage return on a [[stock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Black | first = Ken | chapter = Introduction | title = Business Statistics: Contemporary Decision Making | publisher = Wiley | edition = 6th | date = 2010 | location = Hoboken, NJ | pages = 2–135 | isbn = 0-470-40901-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''location'' in Cartesian coordinates, and ''direction'' measured in degrees from true or magnetic north. Ratios are not meaningful since 20&amp;nbsp;°C cannot be said to be "twice as hot" as 10&amp;nbsp;°C, nor can multiplication/division be carried out between any two dates directly. However, ''ratios of differences'' can be expressed; for example, one difference can be twice another. Interval type variables are sometimes also called "scaled variables", but the formal mathematical term is an [[affine space]] (in this case an [[affine line]]).

====Central tendency and statistical dispersion====
The [[mode (statistics)|mode]], [[median]], and [[arithmetic mean]] are allowed to measure central tendency of interval variables, while measures of statistical dispersion include [[range (statistics)|range]] and [[standard deviation]]. Since one can only divide by ''differences'', one cannot define measures that require some ratios, such as &lt;!--- the studentized range or. --- Error: studentized range is a ratio of a difference (range) to a root-mean-square difference (standard DEVIATION from the mean ---&gt; the [[coefficient of variation]]. More subtly, while one can define [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] about the origin, only central moments are meaningful, since the choice of origin is arbitrary. One can define [[Standardized_moment|standardized moments]], since ratios of differences are meaningful, but one cannot define the coefficient of variation, since the mean is a moment about the origin, unlike the standard deviation, which is (the square root of) a central moment.

=== Ratio scale ===
The ratio type takes its name from the fact that measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (Michell, 1997, 1999). A ratio scale possesses a meaningful (unique and non-arbitrary) zero value.  Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Examples include [[mass]], [[length]], [[Time|duration]], [[plane angle]], [[energy]] and [[electric charge]]. In contrast to interval scales, ratios are now meaningful because having a non-arbitrary zero point makes it meaningful to say, for example, that one object has "twice the length."  Very informally, many ratio scales can be described as specifying "how much" of something (i.e. an amount or magnitude) or "how many" (a count). The [[Kelvin]] temperature scale is a ratio scale because it has a unique, non-arbitrary zero point called [[absolute zero]].  &lt;!-- The zero point of the Celsius scale is at 273.15 kelvins, so Celsius is not a ratio scale. --&gt;

; Central tendency and statistical dispersion
The [[geometric mean]] and the [[harmonic mean]] are allowed to measure the central tendency, in addition to the mode, median, and arithmetic mean. The [[studentized range]] and the [[coefficient of variation]] are allowed to measure statistical dispersion. All statistical measures are allowed because all necessary mathematical operations are defined for the ratio scale.

== Debate on Stevens's typology ==
While Stevens's typology is widely adopted, it is still being challenged by other theoreticians, particularly in the cases of the nominal and ordinal types (Michell, 1986).&lt;ref name = "Velleman and Wilkinson 1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Velleman |first1=Paul F. |last2=Wilkinson |first2=Leland |journal=The American Statistician | title=Nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio typologies are misleading |volume=47 | number=1 | year = 1993 |pages=65–72 |doi=10.2307/2684788 |publisher=American Statistical Association | jstor=2684788 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duncan (1986) objected to the use of the word ''measurement'' in relation to the nominal type, but Stevens (1975) said of his own definition of measurement that "the assignment can be any consistent rule. The only rule not allowed would be random assignment, for randomness amounts in effect to a nonrule". However, so-called nominal measurement involves arbitrary assignment, and the "permissible transformation" is any number for any other. This is one of the points made in Lord's (1953) satirical paper ''On the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lord |first1= Frederic M. |journal=American Psychologist |title = On the Statistical Treatment of Football Numbers |volume=8 |number=12 |date=December 1953  | pages=750–751 |doi=10.1037/h0063675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the mean as a measure of the central tendency for the ordinal type is still debatable among those who accept Stevens's typology. Many behavioural scientists use the mean for ordinal data, anyway. This is often justified on the basis that the ordinal type in behavioural science is in fact somewhere between the true ordinal and interval types; although the interval difference between two ordinal ranks is not constant, it is often of the same order of magnitude.

For example, applications of measurement models in educational contexts often indicate that total scores have a fairly linear relationship with measurements across the range of an assessment. Thus, some argue that so long as the unknown interval difference between ordinal scale ranks is not too variable, interval scale statistics such as means can meaningfully be used on ordinal scale variables. Statistical analysis software such as [[SPSS]] requires the user to select the appropriate measurement class for each variable. This ensures that subsequent user errors cannot inadvertently perform meaningless analyses (for example correlation analysis with a variable on a nominal level).

[[L. L. Thurstone]] made progress toward developing a justification for obtaining the interval type, based on the [[law of comparative judgment]]. A common application of the law is the [[analytic hierarchy process]]. Further progress was made by [[Georg Rasch]] (1960), who developed the probabilistic [[Rasch model]] that provides a theoretical basis and justification for obtaining interval-level measurements from counts of observations such as total scores on assessments.

===Other proposed typologies===
Typologies aside from Stevens's typology has been proposed. For instance, [[Frederick Mosteller|Mosteller]] and [[John Tukey|Tukey]] (1977), Nelder (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Nelder, J. A. (1990). The knowledge needed to computerise the analysis and interpretation of statistical information. In ''Expert systems and artificial intelligence: the need for information about data''. Library Association Report, London, March, 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; described continuous counts, continuous ratios, count ratios, and categorical modes of data. See also Chrisman (1998), van den Berg (1991).&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg, G. (1991). ''Choosing an analysis method''. Leiden: DSWO Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mosteller and Tukey's typology (1977) ====
Mosteller and Tukey&lt;ref name="Mosteller"/&gt; noted that the four levels are not exhaustive and proposed:
# Names
# Grades (ordered labels like beginner, intermediate, advanced)
# Ranks (orders with 1 being the smallest or largest, 2 the next smallest or largest, and so on)
# Counted fractions (bound by 0 and 1)
# Counts (non-negative integers)
# Amounts (non-negative real numbers)
# Balances (any real number)

For example, percentages (a variation on fractions in the Mosteller-Tukey framework) do not fit well into Stevens’s framework: No transformation is fully admissible.&lt;ref name = "Velleman and Wilkinson 1993" /&gt;

==== Chrisman's typology (1998) ====
Nicholas R. Chrisman &lt;ref name="Chrisman"/&gt; introduced an expanded list of levels of measurement to account for various measurements that do not necessarily fit with the traditional notions of levels of measurement. Measurements bound to a range and repeating (like degrees in a circle, clock time, etc.), graded membership categories, and other types of measurement do not fit to Stevens's original work, leading to the introduction of six new levels of measurement, for a total of ten:
# Nominal
# Gradation of membership
# Ordinal
# Interval
# Log-interval
# Extensive ratio
# Cyclical ratio
# Derived ratio
# Counts
# Absolute

While some claim that the extended levels of measurement are rarely used outside of academic geography,&lt;ref name = "Wolman 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Measurement and meaningfulness in conservation science |journal=Conservation Biology |year=2006 |last=Wolman |first=Abel G |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00531.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; graded membership is central to fuzzy set theory, while absolute measurements include probabilities and the plausibility and ignorance in Dempster-Shafer theory. Cyclical ratio measurements include angles and times. Counts appear to be ratio measurements, but the scale is not arbitrary and fractional counts are commonly meaningless. Log-interval measurements are commonly displayed in stock market graphics. All these types of measurements are commonly used outside academic geography, and do not fit well to Stevens' original work.

=== Scale types and Stevens's "operational theory of measurement" ===
The theory of scale types is the intellectual handmaiden to Stevens's "operational theory of measurement", which was to become definitive within psychology and the [[behavioral sciences]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} despite Michell's characterization as its being quite at odds with measurement in the natural sciences (Michell, 1999). Essentially, the operational theory of measurement was a reaction to the conclusions of a committee established in 1932 by the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] to investigate the possibility of genuine scientific measurement in the psychological and behavioral sciences. This committee, which became known as the ''Ferguson committee'', published a Final Report (Ferguson, et al., 1940, p.&amp;nbsp;245) in which Stevens's [[sone]] scale (Stevens &amp; Davis, 1938) was an object of criticism:

{{quote | …any law purporting to express a quantitative relation between sensation intensity and stimulus intensity is not merely false but is in fact meaningless unless and until a meaning can be given to the concept of addition as applied to sensation.}}

That is, if Stevens's ''[[sone]]'' scale genuinely measured the intensity of auditory sensations, then evidence for such sensations as being quantitative attributes needed to be produced. The evidence needed was the presence of ''additive structure'' – a concept comprehensively treated by the German mathematician [[Otto Hölder]] (Hölder, 1901). Given that the physicist and measurement theorist [[Norman Robert Campbell]] dominated the Ferguson committee's deliberations, the committee concluded that measurement in the social sciences was impossible due to the lack of [[concatenation (mathematics)|concatenation]] operations. This conclusion was later rendered false by the discovery of the [[theory of conjoint measurement]] by Debreu (1960) and independently by Luce &amp; Tukey (1964). However, Stevens's reaction was not to conduct experiments to test for the presence of additive structure in sensations, but instead to render the conclusions of the Ferguson committee null and void by proposing a new theory of measurement:

{{quote|Paraphrasing N. R. Campbell (Final Report, p.340), we may say that measurement, in the broadest sense, is defined as the assignment of numerals to objects and events according to rules (Stevens, 1946, p.677).}}

Stevens was greatly influenced by the ideas of another Harvard academic, the [[Nobel prize|Nobel laureate]] physicist [[Percy Bridgman]] (1927), whose doctrine of ''operationism'' Stevens used to define measurement. In Stevens's definition, for example, it is the use of a tape measure that defines length (the object of measurement) as being measurable (and so by implication quantitative). Critics of operationism object that it confuses the relations between two objects or events for properties of one of those of objects or events (Hardcastle, 1995; Michell, 1999; Moyer, 1981a,b; Rogers, 1989).

The Canadian measurement theorist [[William Rozeboom]] (1966) was an early and trenchant critic of Stevens's theory of scale types.

==== Same variable may be different scale type depending on context ====
Another issue is that the same variable may be a different scale type depending on how it is measured and on the goals of the analysis. For example, hair color is usually thought of as a nominal variable, since it has no apparent ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/nominal_ordinal_interval.htm|title=What is the difference between categorical, ordinal and interval variables?|work=Institute for Digital Research and Education|publisher=University of California, Los Angeles|access-date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to order colors (including hair colors) in various ways, including by hue; this is known as [[colorimetry]]. Hue is an interval level variable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7199">The '''low-rate picture transmission''' (LRPT) is a digital transmission system, intended to deliver images and data from an orbital [[weather satellite]] directly to end users via a [[VHF]] radio signal. It is used aboard polar-orbiting, near-Earth weather satellite programs such as [[MetOp]] and [[NPOESS]].

==Purpose==
LRPT provides three image channels at full sensor resolution (10-bit, 1&amp;nbsp;km/pixel, six lines/second) in addition to data from other sensors, such as [[atmospheric sounder]]s and [[GPS]] positioning information.

The system is an update and replacement of the existing analog system called [[automatic picture transmission]] (APT), which has been used since the 1960s aboard [[NOAA]]'s [[TIROS]] polar-orbiting satellites. The APT system provided only two image channels, which were at a reduced accuracy and resolution (8-bit, 4&amp;nbsp;km/pixel, two lines/second). Compared to the APT system, LRPT images are four times more accurate and contain twelve times the resolution. Further, the additional data from other sensors increases the applications of the satellites and the users who receive the signal.

==Design==
LRPT uses a [[packet (information technology)|packetized]] datastream transmitted at an approximately 62 [[kilobits per second]] (kbit/s) rate. Each sensor using the LRPT is considered an application and provided a percentage of the transmission bandwidth in the form of a virtual channel. For example, the [[advanced very-high-resolution radiometer]] (AVHRR) imaging sensor is provided approximately 40 kbit/s to transmit its three image channels, and the [[high-resolution infrared radiation sounder]] (HIRS) is provided approximately 2900 bit/s. The packetized application system provides the flexibility to transmit and receive new types of data in the future using the same hardware.

The datastream is processed using a [[Reed–Solomon]] error correction, then [[convolution]] encoded, [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaved]], and padded with unique synchronization words. The resulting binary stream is approximately 160 kbit/s.

It is transmitted as an 80 [[baud|kiloBaud]] [[quadrature phase-shift keying|quadrature phase-shift keyed]] (QPSK) signal on an RF carrier in the 137&amp;nbsp;MHz-band, with an [[equivalent isotropically radiated power]] level that varies between 3.2 [[dBW]] (2 [[watt]]s) and 8.0 dBW (6.3 watts).

To ensure the low-complexity ground stations that previously received the APT signal would be able to access the LRPT signal, a design study was included with the LRPT specification. Labeled ''Annex 1'', it shows the calculations which approximate the worst-case [[link budget]] for fixed, [[omnidirectional antenna]] reception will be 4.9&amp;nbsp;dB when the satellite is 13° above the horizon, and improve to 8.6&amp;nbsp;dB at 30° or higher elevations.

==Image data==
The AVHRR image data, in its raw form, consists of three images, each composed of six lines per second, at 2048 pixels per line, using 10-bits per pixel. This yields a raw datarate of 368,640 bit/s; approximately ten times greater than the allocated bandwidth. Therefore, the data is compressed using the JPEG extended DCT compression, adapted to a fixed compression ratio with continuous operation (no header or trailer), to fit the virtual channel size.

The imager data is gathered into image "strips" of 2048 pixels wide and 8 rows tall before being compressed. Each packet contains three of these image strips, one for each image channel. To reconstruct a 2048x2048 image requires 256 consecutive AVHRR image packets.

==Current status and future==
Although LRPT is on the European [[MetOp]]-A satellite launched on 19 October 2006, LRPT was permanently deactivated on that vehicle after causing interference with the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/Satellites/CurrentSatellites/Metop/MetopDesign/HIRS/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;).

{{quote|The initial investigations regarding the interference on MetOp-A HIRS have been completed, and the conclusion is that no scenario exists where LRPT on MetOp-A can be turned on without causing heavy interference on HIRS. Due to the operational importance of HIRS and the lack of an established LRPT user community, it is clear that LRPT will not be turned on again operationally on MetOp-A.|Announcement to NOAA from EUMETSAT on 5 February 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://noaasis.noaa.gov/NOAASIS/ml/specialbull.html NOAA special bulletins]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of the fundamental nature of this interference in relation to the [[MetOp]] design, plans to operate LRPT on Metop-B and Metop-C were cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/METOP/message/1780] EUMETSAT User Service, July 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NOAA-19]], launched on 6 February 2009 and still operating as of March 2018, is the last NOAA satellite to carry
the old analog [[automatic picture transmission]] (APT) system, which dates back to the 1960s.
At one point, NOAA indicated it would move to a system such as LRPT on future vehicles,
but after the [[NPOESS]] program was replaced with [[JPSS]] in February 2010, NOAA decided to eliminate Low Rate Data (LRD)
transmissions from [[JPSS]].&lt;ref&gt;http://satelliteconferences.noaa.gov/2013/docs/Tuesday,%20April%209,%202013/2.5a_POES%20to%20JPSS%20Transition.ppt, see slides 6 and 9&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July 2014, Russia launched the METEOR-M No. 2 weather satellite (also known as METEOR-M2) with LRPT on board.
Instructions for receiving LRPT images from this satellite are posted on the
Internet.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-receiving-meteor-m-n2-lrpt-weather-satellite-images-rtl-sdr/, slides 6 and 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIKE 11''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates flow and water level, [[water quality]] and [[sediment transport]] in rivers, [[flood plain]]s, irrigation canals, reservoirs and other inland water bodies. MIKE 11 is a 1-dimensional river model. It was developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]].

MIKE 11 has long been known as a software tool with advanced interface facilities. Since the beginning MIKE 11 was operated through an efficient interactive menu system with systematic layouts and sequencing of menus. It is within that framework where the latest ‘Classic’ version of MIKE 11 – version 3.20 was developed. 

The new generation of MIKE 11 combines the features and experiences from the MIKE 11 ‘Classic’ period, with the powerful Windows based user interface including graphical editing facilities and improved computational speed gained by the full utilization of 32-bit technology.

==Modules==
The computational core of MIKE 11 is a hydrodynamic simulation engine, and this is complemented by a wide range of additional modules and extensions covering almost all conceivable aspects of river modeling. 

'''HD module''': provides fully dynamic solution to the complete [[nonlinear]] [[1-D Saint Venant equation]]s, diffusive wave approximation and kinematic wave approximation, [[Muskingum method]] and [[Muskingum-Cunge method]] for simplified channel routing. It can automatically adapt to [[subcritical flow]] and [[supercritical flow]]. It has ability to simulate standard hydraulic structures such as [[weir]]s, [[culvert]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[pump]]s, [[energy loss]] and [[sluice gate]]s. 

'''GIS Extension''': an extension of [[ArcMap]] from [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] providing features for catchment/river delineation, cross-section and [[Digital Elevation Model]](DEM) data, pollution load estimates, flood visualisation/animation as 2D maps and results presentation/analysis using [[Temporal Analyst]].

'''RR module''': a rainfall runoff module, including the unit hydrograph method (UHM), a lumped conceptual continuous hydrological model and a monthly [[soil moisture]] accounting model. It includes an auto-calibration tool to estimate model parameter based on statistic data of comparison of simulated water levels/discharges and observations.

'''SO module''': a structure operation module. It simulates operational structures such as [[sluice gate]]s, [[weir]]s, [[culvert]]s, [[pump]]s, [[bridge]]s with operating strategies.

'''DB module''': a dam break module. It provides complete facilities for definition of dam geometry, breach development in time and space as well as failure mode.

'''AUTOCAL module''': an automatic calibration tool. It allows automisation of the calibration process for a wide range of parameters, including rainfall runoff parameters, Manning's number, head loss coefficients, water quality parameters etc.

'''AD module''': an advection dispersion module. It simulates transport and spreading of conservative pollutants and constituents as well as heat with linear decay.

'''ST/GST module''': a noncohesive sediment module. It simulates transport, erosion and deposition of non-cohesive and graded noncohesive sediments, including simulations of river morphology.

'''ACS module''': a cohesive sediment module. It has 3-layer bed description, including quasi-2D erosion.

'''MIKE ECO Lab module''': provides ecological modeling. It can simulate [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]]/[[Oxygen saturation|DO]], [[Ammonia]], [[Nitrate]], [[Eutrophication]], heavy metals and [[Wetland]]s. It includes standard templates that are well documented and have been used extensively in numerous applications worldwide. Based on predefined process templates, one can develop his/her own templates.

'''MIKE 11 Stratified module''': models vertical density differences such as salinity or temperature in two-layer or multi-layered stratified water bodies.

'''MIKE 11 Real Time module''': a simulation package and [[GIS]] front-end for setting up operational [[flood forecasting]] systems. It includes real-time updating and kalman filtering.

==Applications==
MIKE 11 has been used in hundreds of application around the world. Its main application areas are flood analysis and alleviation design, real-time flood forecasting, dam break analysis, optimisation of reservoir and canal gate/structure operations, ecological and water quality assessments in rivers and wetlands, sediment transport and river morphology studies, salinity intrusion in rivers and estuaries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13037">The '''marginal value theorem''' ('''MVT''') is an [[optimality model]] that usually describes the behavior of an optimally foraging individual in a system where resources (often food) are located in discrete patches separated by areas with no resources. Due to the resource-free space, animals must spend time traveling between patches. The MVT can also be applied to other situations in which organisms face [[diminishing returns]].

The MVT was first proposed by [[Eric Charnov]] in 1976. In his original formulation: "The predator should leave the patch it is presently in when the marginal capture rate in the patch drops to the average capture rate for the habitat."&lt;ref name="Charnov 1976"&gt;[[Eric Charnov|Charnov, E. L.]] 1976. Optimal foraging: the marginal value theorem. Theoretical Population Biology 9:129–136&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
All animals must forage for food in order to meet their energetic needs, but doing so is energetically costly. It is assumed that evolution by natural selection results in animals utilizing the most economic and efficient strategy to balance energy gain and consumption.  The Marginal Value Theorem is an optimality model that describes the strategy that maximizes gain per unit time in systems where resources, and thus rate of returns, decrease with time.&lt;ref name="Parker 1991"&gt;Parker, G.A. “Marginal Value Theorem with Exploitation Time Costs: Diet, Sperm Reserves, and Optimal Copula Duration in Dung Flies” (1992) The American Naturalist 139(6):1237–1256&lt;/ref&gt; The model weighs benefits and costs and is used to predict giving up time and giving up density. Giving up time (GUT) is the interval of time between when the animal last feeds and when it leaves the patch. Giving up density (GUD) is the food density within a patch when the animal will choose to move on to other food patches.

When an animal is foraging in a system where food sources are patchily distributed, the MVT can be used to predict how much time an individual will spend searching for a particular patch before moving on to a new one. In general, individuals will stay longer if (1) patches are farther apart or (2) current patches are poor in resources. Both situations increase the ratio of travel cost to foraging benefit.

[[File:Marginalvaluetheorem.jpg|thumb|right|400px|The optimal time spent in a patch is given by the tangent to the resource intake curve that departs from the expected transit time value. Any other line crossing the resource intake curve has a shallower slope and thus a sub-optimal resource intake rate.]]

==Modeling==
As animals forage in patchy systems, they balance resource intake, traveling time, and foraging time. Resource intake within a patch diminishes with time, as shown by the solid curve in the graph to the right. The curve follows this pattern because resource intake is initially very fast, but slows as the resource is depleted. Traveling time is shown by the distance from the leftmost vertical dotted line to the y-axis. Optimal foraging time is modeled by connecting this point on the x-axis tangentially to the resource intake curve. Doing so maximizes the ratio between resource intake and time spent foraging and traveling.

At the extremes of the loading curve, animals spend too much time traveling for a small payoff, or they search too long in a given patch for an ineffective load. The MVT identifies the best possible intermediate between these extremes.

===Assumptions===
# The individual is assumed to control when it leaves the patch in order to maximize the ratio between resource intake and time.
# The consumer depletes the amount of resources in the patch where he/she is foraging; therefore, the rate of intake of food in that patch decreases as a function of time.
# If there is variation in the quality of patches, the MVT assumes that different patches are distributed randomly throughout the landscape.

==Examples==

===Humans===
A common illustration of the MVT is apple picking in humans. When one first arrives at a new apple tree, the number of apples picked per minute is high, but it rapidly decreases as the lowest-hanging fruits are depleted. Strategies in which too few apples are picked from each tree or where each tree is exhausted are suboptimal because they result, respectively, in time lost travelling among trees or picking the hard to find last few apples from a tree. The optimal time spent picking apples in each tree is thus a compromise between these two strategies, which can be quantitatively found using the MVT.

===Optimal foraging in great tits===
[[Great tit]]s are a species of bird found throughout Europe, northern Africa, and Asia. They are known to forage in “patchy” environments, and research has shown that their behavior can be modeled by [[Optimal foraging theory|optimal foraging models]], including the MVT. In a 1977 study by R.A. Cowie,&lt;ref name="Cowie 1977"&gt;Cowie, R. J. (1977) “Optimal foraging in great tits (Parus Major)” Nature 268:137–139&lt;/ref&gt; birds were deprived of food and then allowed to forage through patches in two different environments (the environments differed only in distance between patches). As predicted, in both cases birds spent more time in one area when the patches were farther away or yielded more benefits, regardless of the environment. In a similar experiment by Naef-Daenzer (1999),&lt;ref name="ND1999"&gt;Naef-Daenzer, Beat (1999) “Patch time allocation and patch sampling by foraging great and blue tits” Animal Behavior 59:989–999&lt;/ref&gt; great tits were shown to have a foraging efficiency 30% better than random foraging would yield. This is because great tits were specifically spending more time in resource-rich areas, as predicted by the MVT. This data supports the use of the MVT in predicting the foraging behavior of great tits.

===Feeding in hairy armadillos and guinea pigs===
Experimental evidence has shown that [[screaming hairy armadillo]]s and [[guinea pig]]s qualitatively follow MVT when foraging.&lt;ref name="Cassini 1990"&gt;Cassini, Marcelo H., Alejandro Kacelnik, and Enrique T. Segura (1990) “The tale of the screaming hairy armadillo, the guinea pig, and the marginal value theorem” Animal Behavior 39(6):1030–1050&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers ran several parallel experiments: one for each animal under consistent patch quality, and one for guinea pigs with varying patch quality. While the qualitative foraging trend was shown to follow MVT in each case, the quantitative analysis indicated that each patch was exploited further than expected.

===Plant root growth===
The MVT can be used to model foraging in plants as well as animals. Plants have been shown to preferentially place their roots, which are their foraging organs, in areas of higher resource concentration. Recall that the MVT predicts that animals will forage for longer in patches with higher resource quality. Plants increase root biomass in layers/areas of soil that are rich in nutrients and resources, and decrease root growth into areas of poor-quality soil. Thus, plants grow roots into patches of soil according to their wealth of resources in a manner consistent with the MVT.&lt;ref name="mcknickle"&gt;McNickle, Gordon G. and James F. Calhill Jr. “Plant root growth and the marginal value theorem” (2009) Proceedings of the National Academ of Sciences of the United States of America 106(12):4747–4751&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, plant roots grow more quickly through low-quality patches of soil than through high-quality patches of soil, just as foraging animals are predicted to spend less time in low-quality areas than high-quality areas.

===Copulation time in dung flies===
The MVT can be applied to situations other than foraging in which animals experience diminished returns. Consider, for example, the mating copulation duration of the [[Scathophaga stercoraria|yellow dung fly]]. In the dung fly mating system, males gather on fresh cow droppings and wait for females to arrive in smaller groups to lay their eggs. Males must compete with each other for the chance to mate with arriving females—sometimes one male will kick another male off of a female and take over mating with the female mid-copulation. In this instance, the second male fertilizes about 80% of the eggs.&lt;ref name="Parker and Stuart"&gt;Parker, G. A. and R. A. Stuart (1976) “Animal Behavior as a Strategy Optimizer: Evolution of Resource Assessment Strategies and Optimal Emigration Thresholds” The American Naturalist 110(976):1055–1076&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, after a male has mated with a female he guards her so that no other males will have the opportunity to mate with her and displace his sperm before she lays her eggs. After the female lays her eggs, the male must take the time to search for another female before he is able to copulate again.

The question, then, is how long the dung fly should spend copulating with each female. On one hand, the longer a male dung fly copulates the more eggs he can fertilize. However, the benefits of extra copulation time diminish quickly, as the male loses the chance to find another female during long copulations. The MVT predicts that the optimal copulation time is just long enough to fertilize about 80% of the eggs; after this time, the rewards are much smaller and are not worth missing out on another mate.&lt;ref name="Parker and Stuart" /&gt; This predicted value for copulation time, 40 minutes, is very close to the average observed value, 36 minutes.

In dung flies, the observed values of copulation time and time searching for another mate vary with body weight. Heavier males have shorter search times and shorter copulation times. These shorter search times are likely due to increased cost of travel with increased body weight; shorter copulation times probably reflect that it is easier for heavier males to successfully take over females mid-copulation. Additionally, researchers have taken into account “patch quality,” i.e. the quality of females arriving on the various cowpats. Research also shows that males copulate for longer with the larger females who hold more eggs and have larger reproductive tract dimensions. Thus, males change their copulation time to maximize their fitness, but they are doing so in response to selection imposed by female morphology. Even with these variations, male dung flies do exhibit close-to-optimal copulation time relative to their body size, as predicted by the MVT.&lt;ref name ="Parker et al 1999"&gt;Parker, Geoffrey A., Leigh W. Simmons, Paula Stockley, Doreen M. McChristie, and Eric L. Charnov. (1999) “Optimal copula duration in yellow dung flies: effects of female size and egg content.” Animal Behavior 57:795–805&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many studies, such as the examples presented above, have shown good qualitative support for predictions generated by the Marginal Value Theorem. However, in some more quantitative studies, the predictions of the MVT haven’t been as successful, with the observed values substantially deviating from predictions. One proposed explanation for these deviations is that it is difficult to objectively measure payoff rates. For example, an animal in an unpredictable environment may need to spend extra time sampling, making it hard for researchers to determine foraging time.&lt;ref name="Nonacs"&gt;Nonacs, Peter. “State dependent behavior and the marginal value theorem.” (2001) Behavioral Ecology 12(1):71–83&lt;/ref&gt;
        
Beyond this imprecision, some researchers propose that there is something fundamental missing from the model. Namely, animals are probably doing more than just foraging, whether it be dealing with predation risks or searching for mating opportunities.&lt;ref name="Nonacs" /&gt; Natural selection is not the only force influencing the evolution of species. Sexual selection, for example, may alter foraging behaviors, making them less consistent with the MVT. These researchers point out that the marginal value theorem is a starting point, but complexity and nuances must be incorporated into models and tests for foraging and patch-use.

One other type of model that has been used in place of MVT in predicting foraging behavior is the state-dependent behavior model. Although state-dependent models have been viewed as a generalization of the MVT,&lt;ref name="Wajnberg et al 2000"&gt;Wajnberg Eric, Pierre Bernhard, Frederic Hamelin and Guy Boivin (2006). "Optimal patch time allocation for time-limited foragers." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 60, 1–10&lt;/ref&gt; they are unlikely to generate broadly applicable predictions like those from the MVT because they test predictions under a specific set of conditions. While the predictions of these models must be tested under precise conditions, they might offer valuable insights not available from broader models such as MVT.&lt;ref name="Nonacs" /&gt;

'''Mario Mieli''' (21 May 1952, [[Milan]] – 12 March 1983) was a leading figure in the Italian [[gay]] movement of the 1970s. He combined a radical theoretical perspective with a provocative public persona. His sometimes outrageous public behavior made him a controversial figure, but he was nonetheless respected as one of the movement's most important intellectuals. He’s best known among English speakers for ''Towards a Gay Communism'', a political pamphlet excerpted from his major theoretical work ''Homosexuality and Liberation: Elements of a Gay Critique''.

== Life ==
Mieli was born in [[Milan]] on May 21, 1952 into a large and prosperous family. He lived for the first sixteen years of his life on his family's estate near [[Como]]. He moved back to Milan with his family in 1968. Politically precocious, he threw himself into the student uprising of that year, beginning a long commitment to revolutionary causes.

In 1971 he moved to London as a student, where he took an active part in the London Gay Liberation Front. Though he spent intermittent time in London until 1975, in 1972 based himself in Milan where he studied at university. In April 1972, he, along with [[Massimo Consoli]] (1945–2007), Nicolino Tosoni (b. 1943), Angelo Pezzana (b. 1940) and the French writer [[Françoise d'Eaubonne]] (1920–2005) held the first homosexual demonstration in Italy at a Congress of Sexology in [[Sanremo|San Remo]]. They protested against psychiatric condemnation of homosexual conduct and the use of aversion therapy to "convert" homosexuals.

In 1972, Mieli helped found the collective Fronte Unitario Omosessuale Rivoluzionario Italiano (Italian revolutionary homosexual united front). Better known by its acronym F.U.O.R.I! (Come out!), it was Italy's first major gay-rights group. Started in Turin in 1971, F.U.O.R.I! appeared almost simultaneously in Rome, Padua, Venice and in Milan, where Mieli was an organizer. After the collective united with the Italian Radical Party, Mieli criticized the move as "counter-revolutionary," since he thought the gay movement should remain independent of political parties. He left the organization over political differences in 1974–75.

After 1974 Mieli continued his activism by organizing the Collettivi Omosessuali Milanesi (Homosexual collectives of Milan). In 1976 the group’s gay theatrical group, Nostra Signora dei Fiori, staged his play ''La Traviata Norma. Ovvero: Vaffanculo... ebbene sì!'' (the title’s numerous puns defy translation). This outrageous production was successfully staged in Milan, Florence, and Rome. An in-your-face spectacle, it deliberately presented behavior designed to flout conventional, heterosexual norms.

A controversial personality, Mieli sometimes made a spectacle of himself. Once in Rome he publicly ate his own excrement and that of a dog.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} While some may have found this behavior outrageous or frightening, others knew him as a gentle person who enjoyed [[cross-dressing]], capable of being very charming in private.

By 1976, Mieli had graduated and began revising for publication his doctoral thesis in Moral Philosophy. The revision was published as ''Elementi di critica omosessuale''. An English translation of the book was made by [[David Fernbach]] as ''Homosexuality and Liberation: Elements of a Gay Critique''. The translation’s last chapter – "Towards a Gay Communism"—was excerpted as a political pamphlet and became Mieli’s most widely known work among English speakers.

This major theoretical work is widely considered the most important text from the Italian gay community. With rich humor and a cosmopolitan gay sensibility, Mieli contends that homosexual liberation is an integral and indispensable part of a much wider emancipation. Mieli cites "educastration" at the core of a repressive set of norms intended to stifle the full expression of a natural human [[transsexuality]]. He combines [[Freud]]'s ideas on "polymorphous perversion" (see [[Polymorphous perverse]]) with [[Marxist economics]] to argue that human liberation is possible only through a revolution allowing uninhibited [[pansexuality]].

By 1981, Mieli became increasingly pessimistic about his cause. In 1983, he told friends about a forthcoming book titled ''Il risveglio dei Faraoni'' (''The Awakening of the Pharaohs''). It was to be an autobiographical novel, set in Egypt featuring a resurrected Jesus. However, in early March, he decided to stop publication of the book, writing in a letter to a friend that the book might inspire someone to "have his hide". In another letter dated March 11, he wrote, "My book will not be published by my free choice".

Mario Mieli killed himself the following day, on March 12, 1983. He died at age 30 from asphyxiation by inhaling gas in his Milan apartment.

It seems that Mieli's suicide stemmed from adverse reaction he expected from the book’s publication. Although a pirated edition was later published, his family brought legal action and had all copies destroyed. Only in 1994 was ''Il risveglio dei Faraoni'' published legally.

[[Image:peat sand filter.jpg|250px|thumb|Peat-sand filter in United States. The filter treats [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]] from a residential area.  Stormwater from streets is first routed to a small [[detention basin]] (rear of photo, behind berm), which removes coarse [[sediment]]. After filtration an under-drain piping system discharges the filtered water to an adjacent stream.]]

A '''media filter''' is a type of [[filter (water)|filter]] that uses a bed of [[sand]], peat, shredded tires, foam, crushed glass, geo-textile fabric, [[anthracite]], crushed [[granite]] or other material to filter [[water]] for drinking, [[swimming pool]]s, [[aquaculture]], [[irrigation]], [[stormwater]] management, oil &amp; gas operations, and other applications.

==Filter design==
One design brings the water in the top of a container through a "header" which distributes the water evenly. The filter "media" start with fine sand on the top and then graduatingly coarser sand in a number of layers followed by gravel on the bottom, in gradually larger sizes. The top sand physically removes particles from the water. The job of the subsequent layers is to support the finer layer above and provide efficient drainage.

As particles become trapped in the media, the differential pressure across the bed increases.  Periodically, a backwash may be initiated to remove the solids trapped in the bed.  During backwash, flow is directed in the opposite direction as normal flow.  In multi-media filters, the layers in the media re-stratify due to density differences prior to resuming normal filtration. 

=== Drinking water filtration systems ===
Municipal drinking water systems often use a [[rapid sand filter]] and/or a [[slow sand filter]] for [[water purification|purification]].

=== Media filtration for stormwater ===
[[File:Stormwater Filtration System.jpg|thumb|250px|Media filter system for [[urban runoff]]]]
Media filters are used to protect [[water quality]] in [[stream]]s, [[river]]s, and [[lake]]s. They can be effective at removing [[water pollution|pollutants]] in stormwater such as [[suspended solids]] and [[phosphorus]].  Sand is the most common filter material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wef.org Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdU-VXXV_H0C "Urban Runoff Quality Management."] WEF Manual of Practice No. 23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No. 87. 1998. {{ISBN|1-57278-039-8}}. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atlanta Regional Commission. Atlanta, GA.[http://www.georgiastormwater.com/vol2/3-2-4.pdf "Georgia Stormwater Management Manual."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728122455/http://www.georgiastormwater.com/vol2/3-2-4.pdf |date=2007-07-28 }} Section 3.2.4: "Sand Filters." August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In other filters, sometimes called "organic filters," [[wood chips]] or [[leaf mold]] may be used.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.,'' [http://www.georgiastormwater.com/vol2/3-3-3.pdf Section 3.3.3: "Organic Filter."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624103658/http://www.georgiastormwater.com/vol2/3-3-3.pdf |date=2007-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media filtration for sewage and wastewater ===

Media filters are also used for cleaning the effluent from [[septic tanks]] and primary settlement tanks.  The materials commonly used are [[sand]], [[peat]] and natural stone fibre.

=== Media filtration for the oil &amp; gas industry ===
The oil &amp; gas industry uses media filters for various purposes in both upstream and downstream operations.  [[Nut shell filter|Nut shell filters]] are commonly used as a tertiary oil removal step for produced water treatment.  Sand filters are often used to remove fine solids following biological treatment and clarification of refinery wastewater.  Multi-media filters are used for removing suspended solids from both [[produced water]] and refinery wastewater.   The materials commonly used in multi-media filters are gravel, sand, garnet, and anthracite.

The '''Mermaid Theatre''' was a theatre encompassing the site of [[Puddle Dock]] and [[Worshipful Company of Curriers|Curriers' Alley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/LONDON-COMPANYS/2000-08/0967625368 www.ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] in the [[City of London]], and the first built in the City since the time of [[Shakespeare]]. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.

==History==
The 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor [[Bernard Miles]] with his wife, [[Josephine Wilson]]. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the [[St. John's Wood]] area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' with [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Maggie Teyte]] and [[Thomas Hemsley]], conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McArthur |first=Edwin |date=1965 |title=Flagstad, A Personal Memoir |publisher=A. A. Knopf |location=New York |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, and his revenues from publicity spots for the [[Egg Marketing Board]]; he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the [[Jacobean era]], to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by [[Philip Rosseter]] with distant backing from [[Philip Henslowe|Henslowe]] and [[Edward Alleyn|Alleyn]], was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of ''[[Lock Up Your Daughters (musical)|Lock Up Your Daughters]]'' and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as ''[[Cowardy Custard]]'' (often cited{{who|date=October 2015}} as responsible for the revival of interest in [[Noël Coward]]'s works) and including an annual staging of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', with Miles reprising his role of [[Long John Silver]], which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 February 1991 |title=The life and stage of Josephine Wilson – One of the founders of the Molecule Club |first=Donald |last=Gould|work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12917556-900-forum-the-life-and-stage-of-josephine-wilson-one-of-the-founders-of-the-molecule-club/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1961 the poet and author [[Sylvia Plath]] read her poem "Tulips" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, [[Ted Hughes]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Other notable productions include the 1978 première of ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway?]]'', with [[Tom Conti]] and [[Rona Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/10250854/Rona-Anderson.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Obituary: Rona Anderson | date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] sometimes transferred Stratford productions to the Mermaid, including a residency during 1987 which saw the staging of seven plays.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn2.rsc.org.uk/sitefinity/press-resources/performance-history---june-2016.pdf?sfvrsn=8&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomba Holdings, a property company owned by Ugandan Asian businessman Abdul Shamji and his family, which claimed to have interests in the [[Garrick Theatre|Garrick]] and [[Duchess Theatre|Duchess]] theatres as well as [[Wembley Stadium]],&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre--reversal-of-fortune-a-21yearold-has-bold-new-plans-to-save-the-mermaid-theatre-charles-nevin-meets-the-man-with-a-mission-2316506.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Charles | last=Nevin | title=Reversal of fortune: A 21-year-old has bold new plans to save the Mermaid Theatre | date=30 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; bought the theatre in the mid-1980s in the hope of redeveloping the Puddle Dock site. Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the [[Johnson Matthey]] bank collapse.&lt;ref name="Offstage drama at the Mermaid"&gt;{{cite news |first= Charles|last= Neviin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/captain-moonlight-offstage-drama-at-the-mermaid-1466921.html |title= Captain Moonlight: Offstage drama at the Mermaid|publisher=The Independent|access-date= 11 April 2018 |location=London |date= 12 December 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthaboutlloyds.com/fraud/myth85.html |title=Not a Myth of Hindsight: 1085 |website=Truth About Lloyds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19891101&amp;id=jEVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1612,32433 |title=Prison for millionaire who lied |work=Glasgow Herald |date=1 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

[[Marc Sinden]] was appointed [[artistic director]] in 1993, opening the Bernard Miles Studio as a second performance area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Atwood |title=Sinden vows Mermaid will rival West End |work=The Stage |date=12 August 1993 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001180/19930812/034/0005|url-access=subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; but left the next year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/facethefacts 3 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Roy Marsden]] and Vanessa Ford took over the running of the theatre for a few months prior to its eventual closure and the termination of the Shamji family's ownership.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

After a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 [[Ken Livingstone]], the [[Mayor of London]], ordered the council to block the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mayor gives theatre a lifeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2939777.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, ''[[Friday Night is Music Night]]'' that showcased musicians such as the violinist [[Nigel Kennedy]] and singer [[Josh Groban]]. In 2006, music duo [[Pet Shop Boys]] played a mid-length set accompanied by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled [[Concrete (Pet Shop Boys album)|Concrete]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Loss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans==
In September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the [[Theatres Trust]] and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt; granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer £6 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/18/arts.artsnews | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Ward | title=Manchester theatre eyes Mermaid | date=2003-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners were concerned that the entire building might be demolished.&lt;ref name="Outrage"&gt;{{cite web |first= Lalayn |last= Baluch |date= 30 September 2008 |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/21927/campaigners-outraged-as-city-of-london|title=Outrage as Mermaid Theatre developer released from £6m donation deal |website= [[The Stage]] |accessdate= 11 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former chairman of the Save London's Theatres Campaign, John Levitt, called the decision “a tragedy” and “sheer meanness”.&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt;

In 2018 the Mermaid Theatre still exists as a conference centre called The Mermaid London.

'''Michigan Cyber Range''' was established by [[Merit Network]] in the summer of 2012 to teach [[cybersecurity]] certification courses and to provide cybersecurity-related services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.merit.edu/cyberrange/ |title= Michigan Cyber Range |publisher= Merit Network |accessdate= June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merit Network staffs and operates the Michigan Cyber Range in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]]. The Range's infrastructure contains [[Virtual private server|virtual servers]] placed on Merit's fiber-optic network. The Michigan Cyber Range currently has four physical locations in Michigan, on the campuses of [[Eastern Michigan University]] in [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]], [[Ferris State University]] in [[Big Rapids, Michigan|Big Rapids]], [[Northern Michigan University]] in [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]], and the [[110th Attack Wing]] facility in [[Battle Creek, Michigan|Battle Creek]]. Expansion plans could involve as many as 10 sites.

== History ==
The Michigan Cyber Range was a foundational piece of [[Michigan Governor]] [[Rick Snyder]]'s cyber initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.michigan.gov/cybersecurity |title= Michigan Cyber Initiative |publisher= State of Michigan |accessdate= June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was launched in October 2011 to improve cybersecurity efforts to protect families, communities, businesses and government. Merit Network's CEO and President Don Welch who, while a professor helped create the [[United States Military Academy]]'s cybersecurity program, worked with David Behen of the State and Brigadier General Mike Stone from the [[Michigan National Guard]] to create the vision for the Cyber Range and secure its start-up funding. Throughout 2012, public and private organizations pledged funds and the Michigan Cyber Range was created and staffed.

William J. "Joe" Adams joined Merit Network in June 2012 as executive director of research and the Michigan Cyber Range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first= Greg |last= Monroe |date= June 13, 2012 |url= https://www.merit.edu/merit-network-welcomes-new-executive-director-of-research-and-the-michigan-cyber-range/ |title= Merit Network Welcomes New Executive Director of Research and the Michigan Cyber Range |publisher= Merit Network |accessdate= June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams, a career [[Signal Corps]] officer in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], was formerly CIO of the [[National Defense University]].  Adams has also served as a professor and research scientist at West Point and network engineer for the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]].

Shortly after his hiring, Adams assembled a staff to create and maintain the Michigan Cyber Range's cybersecurity training environment, which is called Alphaville.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= John, II |last= Breeden |date= April 25, 2014 |url= http://gcn.com/articles/2014/04/25/alphaville-cybersecurity-training-facility.aspx |title= In Virtual Town of Alphaville, Students Prep for Cyber Sieges |work= GCN Magazine |accessdate= June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alphaville is a virtual environment that simulates the computer systems of a town hall, library, small company, police station, and power company.  Organizations and companies can practice the detection and mitigation of cybersecurity threats using the Alphaville environment.

On October 15, 2014, Consumers Energy and DTE Energy conducted an incident response exercise using the Michigan Cyber Range.  Representatives from the two power companies and the Michigan State Police worked closely with Cyber Range staff to create the exercise, called "Power Phoenix", which required participants to diagnose and mitigate a malware-compromised computer network and SCADA environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date= October 20, 2014 |url= http://www.marketwatch.com/story/michigan-cyber-range-hosts-cyber-exercise-for-consumers-and-dte-energy-2014-10-20 |title= Michigan Cyber Range Hosts Cyber Exercise for Consumers and DTE Energy |publisher= MarketWatch |accessdate= October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mile2.com/latest-news/michigan-cyber-range-to-debut-scada-security-training-component.html "Michigan Cyber Range to Debut SCADA Security Training Component," by Nikolay Tsvetkov, Mile2], retrieved April 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, [[Wayne County Community College District]] (WCCCD), in conjunction with the Michigan Cyber Range and Mile2, hosted a groundbreaking veteran's retraining program. The 13-week program prepared a group of military veterans for a career in cybersecurity.  17 students participated in the retraining program. The veterans were selected based on their experience and aptitude, in conjunction with Wayne County’s veterans affairs office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merit.edu/new-cybersecurity-retraining-program-for-veterans-debuts/ "New Cybersecurity Program for Veterans"], press release, Merit Network, February 12, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2016, the Michigan Cyber Range added new publicly-accessible hubs of the in Southeast Michigan.  Each location provides certification courses, cybersecurity training exercises and product hardening/testing through a direct connection to the Michigan Cyber Range.  Cyber Range Hubs opened inside the Velocity Center at Macomb-Oakland University&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macombdaily.com/article/MD/20160318/NEWS/160319653 "Michigan Cyber Range opens in Sterling Heights"], Sean Delaney, Macomb Daily, March 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; in Sterling Heights on March 18th and at Pinckney Community High School&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinckneyschools.org/index.php/home/more-pcs-info/pinckney-pride/1178-pinckney-cyber-training-institute-grand-opening "Pinckney CTI Grand Opening"], news article, Pinckney Community Schools, December 7, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; on December 7th.  

During the fall of 2016, Merit Network and Michigan Governor Rick Snyder launched the Governor's High School Cyber Challenge, a competition for high school students to test their skills in computer science, information technology and cybersecurity.  The final round of the challenge happened at the North American International Cyber Summit, hosted by Governor Snyder on October 17, 2016.  The three-person team from Clinton High School was crowned champions of the competition after defeating the 28 other teams in the inaugural event.  The Michigan Cyber Range provided the challenges and infrastructure for the annual cyber competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statescoop.com/michigan-aims-to-spur-economy-through-student-cyber-competition "Michigan aims to spur economy through student cyber competition"], Darlene Aderoju, State Scoop, August 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michigan Cyber Range has twice been named the North American Authorized Training Center (ATC) of the year by [[Mile2]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merit.edu/merit-named-mile2-training-center-of-the-year/ "Merit Named Mile2 Training Center of the Year," by Brian Warkoczeski, Merit, March 26, 2015], retrieved April 27, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, the Michigan Cyber Range doubled the participation in the Governor’s High School Cyber Challenge from 292 high school students to 584. This included successful elicitation of participation from Native American tribal areas in Michigan. Another milestone was the addition of Cyber Range hubs in Florida and Georgia. Continuing their commitment since 2015, the Cyber Range provides exercises, support and infrastructure to the US Cyber Challenge, a national cyber competition sponsored by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. Other milestones include the creation of virtual environments to facilitate cybersecurity involvement in kinetic training exercises, creation of an International Cyber Exercise (ICE) to promote collaboration and partnership between states’ [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] units and the countries participating in the [[State Partnership Program]] (SPP), and the successful launch of the Regional Cybersecurity Education Collaboration in partnership with the [[Michigan|State of Michigan]] and [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]. The ICE event in 2017 was run at the NAICS – 12 states and 10 countries participated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5681">{{Theosophy}}
The term '''Neo-Theosophy''' is a term, originally derogatory, used by the followers of [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]] to denominate the system of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] ideas expounded by [[Annie Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]] following the death of Madame Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely Theosophical by many Theosophists around the world. 

==Overview==
After Blavatsky died in 1891, [[William Quan Judge]] became involved in a dispute with [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Annie Besant]] over Judge allegedly forging letters from the Mahatmas. As a result, he ended his association with Olcott and Besant during 1895 and took most of the Society's American Section with him. He managed his new organization for about a year until his death in [[New York City]], whereupon [[Katherine Tingley]] became manager. The organization originating from the faction of Olcott and Besant is based in India and known as the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society - Adyar]], while the organization managed by Judge is known nowadays simply as the [[Theosophical Society Pasadena|Theosophical Society]], but often with the specification, "international headquarters, [[Pasadena, California]]."  The ''Theosophical Society - Adyar'' is the group denounced as ''Neo-Theosophy'' by those who are followers of William Q. Judge and the original teachings of Madame Blavatsky; they do not accept what they regard as the ''Neo-Theosophical'' teachings of Annie Besant, Henry Olcott, and [[C. W. Leadbeater]]. 

The term ''Neo-Theosophy'' was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912 in a book called ''Neo Theosophy Exposed'', the second part of an earlier book called ''The Theosophical Society and its Esoteric Bogeydom''.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Lewis, Jesper Aagaard Petersen, ''Controversial New Religions'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-19-515682-X}}  Page 292&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1924, Margaret Thomas published a book called ''Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy''. This book, now available online,&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/thomas/index.htm Theosophy vs. Neo-Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; presents a detailed critical comparison of Blavatskyian Theosophy and Neo-Theosophy.

[[G. R. S. Mead]] who was also highly critical of the clairvoyant researches of Besant and Leadbeater, remaining loyal to Blavatskyian Theosophy,&lt;ref&gt;by [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], Clare Goodrick-Clarke  ''G. R. S. Mead and the Gnostic Quest'' North Atlantic Books {{ISBN|1-55643-572-X}} Page 22&lt;/ref&gt; also used the term Neo-Theosophy to refer to Besant's movement.  For him "Theosophy" meant the wisdom element in the great world religions and philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Demetres P. Tryphonopoulos, ''The Celestial Tradition: A Study of Ezra Pound's the Cantos'' , Wilfrid Laurier University Press 1992 {{ISBN|0-88920-202-8}} Page 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the term Neo-Theosophical came to be used outside Theosophical circles to refer to groups formed by former Theosophists as well as groups whose central premises borrow heavily from Blavatskyian Theosophy. Robert S. Ellwood, in his 1973 book ''Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America'' referred to organizations that had been formed by former Theosophists as "devolutions of Theosophy" and included in his survey "Neo-Gnostic groups and Neo-Rosicrucian groups [...] the [[Anthroposophy]] of [[Rudolf Steiner]], [...] [[Alice Bailey]]'s groups, ([[Guy Ballard]]'s) [["I AM" Activity]] and [[Max Heindel]]'s [[Rosicrucian Fellowship|Rosicrucianism]].&lt;ref&gt; Robert S. Ellwood, Jr., "Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America", Prentice-Hall, 1973 {{ISBN|0-13-773317-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later book, ''Alternative Altars'' (1979) Professor Ellwood added;

{{quote|Alice Bailey (1880 - 1949), founder of the Arcane School and the Full Moon Meditation Groups, and Guy Ballard (1878 - 1930), of the "I AM" movement, are representative of those who have started activities based on new and special communications from Theosophical Masters.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Ellwood, Jr., Alternative Altars: Unconventional and Eastern Spirituality in America, University of Chicago Press, 1979 {{ISBN|0-226-20618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The author Daryl S. Paulson associates "neo-Theosophy" with Alice Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;Daryl S. Paulson, "The Near-Death Experience: An Integration of Cultural, Spiritual, and Physical Perspectives", ''Journal of Near-Death Studies'', Springer, Netherlands, ISSN 0891-4494 (Print) 1573-3661 (Online) Issue Volume 18, Number 1 / September, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Other neo-Theosophists include [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]]'s contemporary [[Peter Deunov]] and [[Samael Aun Weor]], who introduced theosophical teachings to Latin America.  [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] were also influencers of (and influenced by) the leading edge of the theosophical movement, which in turn influenced [[Anton LaVey]]'s [[LaVeyan Satanism|Satanism]], [[L. Ron Hubbard]]'s [[Scientology]], [[Wicca]], and the modern [[New Age]] and [[New Thought]] movements. (Alice Bailey introduced the term ''New Age'').&lt;ref&gt;See Neville Drury. "Why Does Aleister Crowley Still Matter?" Richard Metzger, ed. ''Book of Lies: The Disinformation Guide to Magick and the Occult.'' Disinformation Books, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of Neo-Theosophists today include  [[Benjamin Creme]] and Douglas Baker.

The '''New York State Agricultural Experiment Station''' ('''NYSAES''') at [[Geneva, New York|Geneva]], [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]], [[New York State]], is an [[agricultural experiment station]] operated by the [[Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences|New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]] at [[Cornell University]]. In August 2018, the station was rebranded as Cornell AgriTech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flynn |first=Erin |date=2018-08-01 |title=‘Cornell AgriTech’ reflects influence in food, ag innovation |url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2018/08/cornell-agritech-reflects-influence-food-ag-innovation |work=[[Cornell Chronicle]] |location=[[Ithaca, New York]] |access-date=2018-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Station is the sixth oldest institution of its kind in the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==History==
The New York State Agricultural Experiment Station was established by an Act of the [[New York State Legislature]] on June 26, 1880. More than 100 locations were considered, but a 125-acre parcel in Geneva was eventually chosen. In 1882, the State purchased the land, an [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] [[villa]], and all outbuildings from Nehemiah and Louisa Denton for $25,000. The villa was converted into the Station headquarters, now known as [[Parrott Hall]]. The new institution became operative on March 1, 1882. It would become known colloquially as the Geneva Experiment Station.

An 1883 Report of the Board of Control of the NYSAES to the New York State Assembly stated that there were immediate and dire threats State agricultural output caused by insect pests, bovine diseases, drought, soil nutrient exhaustion, and outward labor migration, and that an organization dedicated to staving off these threats was needed. &lt;ref name=2018FruitsExhibit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/collections/fruitsofny/ |title=Fruits of New York |last=Fitzgerald |first=Kristin |date=2018-09-06 |website=New York State Library Archived Exhibitions |publisher=New York State Library |access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, farmers wanted the station to serve as a model farm.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} However, the first director, E. Lewis Sturtevant, immediately established the policy that the station was to conduct [[agricultural science]] [[research]] and to establish experimental plots, both of which would have little resemblance to commercial [[agriculture]]. Nevertheless, the primary mission of the Station has always been to serve those who produce and consume New York's agricultural products.

In its early days, Station scientists, who were few in number, concentrated their efforts on [[dairy]], [[horticulture]], and evaluation of varieties of [[vegetable]]s and [[field crop]]s. In 1887, the program was broadened to include work on [[beef]] [[cattle]], [[swine]], and evaluation of [[fruit]] varieties. During this period, the station also began playing its continuing active role in the state's agricultural law enforcement program.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Still later, research activities were added in the fields of [[bacteriology]], [[dairy]] science, fruit [[horticulture]], [[chemistry]], [[plant pathology]], and [[insect]] and [[mite]] species.

At the beginning of the twentieth century, a fundamental philosophy was developed regarding activities of the station that is still, basically, in effect today. This philosophy stated that research done at the station should be conducted on principles underlying agricultural practices and, further, that agricultural research should be the full-time responsibility of the staff without it having to also play a teaching role. This was a marked departure from the role played by staff at other agricultural experiment stations throughout the country.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Originally an independent unit of the state, the Station became part of [[Cornell University]] in 1923. Research was expanded to include studies on [[canning]] crops, [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery plants]], and disease and insect [[pest (animal)|pest]]s of [[Rubus|rubes]]. At the end of [[World War II]], all [[animal]] research was moved to the [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] campus of Cornell University and the Geneva Station became a true horticultural research institute. Since then, it has been the center for research in New York on the production, protection, and utilization of fruit and vegetable crops, an industry that is today valued in excess of $2 billion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

The station has expanded from the original 125 acres, mansion and outbuildings to an 850-acre complex containing more than 20 major buildings. There are 700 acres are devoted to test plots, [[orchard]]s, and [[vineyard]]s, and 65,000 square feet of greenhouse space. &lt;ref name=2018FruitsExhibit /&gt; New York State funded a $6.7 million construction project to renovate the Food Science Laboratory in 2007, with work completed by 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000383.pdf p. 81 Retrieved 2007-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Plant Genetic Resources Unit, which collects and does research on seeds for food plants, is also located on the Geneva campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=19-10-00-00&lt;/ref&gt;

The station has two outlying substations: the Hudson Valley Laboratory in [[Highland, Ulster County, New York|Highland]], and the [http://lergp.cce.cornell.edu Cornell Lake Erie Research &amp; Extension Laboratory] in [[Portland, New York|Portland]].

==Research and Publications==
Although an experiment station with a strong emphasis on [[applied science|applied research]], the station also maintains a balance of [[basic research]] to serve as a foundation for future research applicable to New York agriculture. As of 2006, there were 350 employees working on approximately 230 different projects. Of those employees, 56 were professors.

Shortly after Station opened, Emmet S. Goff (1853–1902) became its first horticulturalist. His work on apple varieties, begun in 1883, produced a collection of research on apples and crabapples that was, at the time, the "most noteworthy collection of its kind", containing over 700 named varieties of apples and crabapples.&lt;ref name=2018FruitsExhibit /&gt; Apple breeding efforts at the Station have led to the development of the [[Cortland (apple)|Cortland]], [[Empire (apple)|Empire]], [[Jonagold]], Jonamac and [[Macoun apple|Macoun]] [[apple]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/96/1.18.96/fortune.html Experiment Station unveils state's Fortune] Cornell News Service 01-18-1996&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1900 to 1925, the Station published a series of seven monographs on hardy fruits that were well adapted to northern climes as part of their annual report. The publications began with the two-volume ''Apples of New York'', a 1905 report written by Station horticulturalist [[Spencer Ambrose Beach]]. The series was continued by [[Ulysses Prentiss Hedrick]], who released six volumes on grapes, plums, cherries, peaches, pears and small fruits over a period of eighteen years. The Station's series on the fruits of New York was, and remains today, a highly respected publication. A circular released July 1932 to commemorate  Station's fiftieth year noted the "exhaustive monographs on the hardy fruits" and stated that the texts were, by that time, "accepted universally as standard treatises on the subject." The Fruits of New York series was the highlight of a 2018 exhibition by the [[New York State Library]].&lt;ref name=2018FruitsExhibit /&gt; 

In 2006, the Station developed three new wine grapes: 'Noiret', 'Corot noir' and 'Valvin Muscat' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2006/07/cornell-releases-three-new-wine-grape-varieties |last=Ogrodnick |first=Joseph |title=Cornell releases three new grape varieties  |date=2006-10-21 |website=Cornell University |publisher=Cornell Chronicle |location=[[Ithaca, New York]] |access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell's School of Integrative Plant Science contains the only horticulture program offered in any Ivy League school.&lt;ref name=2018FruitsExhibit /&gt;

==Operations==
Prior to the early 2000s, most of the money for agricultural research at the Station was provided by state and federal governments.  The Station's 2007&amp;ndash;2008 total budget was approximately $25.1 million; $11.8 million funded through the [[State University of New York]] base budget, $6.4 million from Cornell general purpose funds, $5.5 million in grants and contracts, and $1.1 Federal appropriations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000383.pdf page 25 Retrieved 2007-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  As the station's research program has matured and expanded, the financial support base has been increasingly augmented by funds from foundations, industry, grower and food processor organizations, and by individuals.

“'''On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computing Science'''” is a 1988 paper by [[Edsger W. Dijkstra|E. W. Dijkstra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|1036|On the Cruelty of Really Teaching Computing Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argues that [[computer programming]] should be understood as a branch of [[mathematics]], and that the formal [[mathematical proof|provability]] of a [[computer program|program]] is a major criterion for correctness.

Despite the title, most of the article is on Dijkstra’s attempt to put [[computer science]] into a wider perspective within [[science]], teaching being addressed as a [[corollary]] at the end.
Specifically, Dijkstra made a “proposal for an introductory programming course for freshmen” that
consisted of [[Hoare logic]] as an uninterpreted [[formal system]].

== Debate over feasibility ==

Since the term "software engineering" was coined, [[formal verification]] has almost always been considered too resource-intensive to be feasible.  In complex applications, the difficulty of correctly specifying what the program should do in the first place is also a common source of error.  Other methods of [[software testing]] are generally employed to try to eliminate [[Software bug|bugs]] and many other factors are considered in the measurement of [[software quality]].

The notion that cost of production of hardware should be a constraint in programming was foreign to Dijkstra. He viewed the cost controls as artifacts that could become excuses and the controls of nature as nonexistent in [[digital electronics|digital system]]s, which above the level of circuits guarantee a second, constructed nature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Until the end of his life, Dijkstra maintained that the central challenges of computing hadn’t been met to his satisfaction, due to an insufficient emphasis on [[program correctness]] (though not obviating other requirements, such as [[maintainability]] and [[algorithmic efficiency|efficiency]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EWD|1304|The end of Computing Science?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pedagogical legacy ==

Computer science as taught today does not follow {{em | all}} of Dijkstra's advice.  The curricula generally emphasize techniques for managing complexity and preparing for future changes, following Dijkstra's earlier writings.  These include [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], [[programming by contract]], and [[Design pattern (computer science)|design patterns]].  Programming techniques to avoid bugs and conventional software testing methods are taught as basic requirements, and students are exposed to certain mathematical tools, but formal verification methods are not included in the curriculum except perhaps as an advanced topic.&lt;ref&gt;MIT Courses :

&lt;/ref&gt; So in some ways, Dijkstra's ideas have been adhered to; however, the ideas he felt most strongly about have not been.

Newly formed curricula in software engineering have adopted Dijkstra's recommendations.  The focus of these programs is the formal specification of software requirements and design in order to facilitate the formal validation of system correctness.  In Canada, they are often accredited engineering degrees with similar core competencies in physics-based engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.utep.edu/portals/870/parnas_seisnotcs.pdf ''Software Engineering Programs Are Not Computer Science Programs'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also greater emphasis on the social aspects of programming, such as learning how to program as part of a team, and how to write code that is easily re-used by other people, or "borrowing" code from other programs' source code, which was not considered immoral or illegal at the time. Some institutions focus more on pleasing the computing industry by teaching the most popular programming languages, or teaching the use of commonly available development tools, than they do on imparting the foundational concepts of computing science.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

'''Organic chocolate''' is [[chocolate]] which has been [[Organic certification|certified organic]]. As of 2016, it was a growing sector in the global chocolate industry. [[Organic food|Organic]] chocolate is a [[Conspicuous conservation|socially-desirable]] product for some consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-money-organic-chocolate-idUSKBN0LF2F820150211|title=Is organic chocolate worth the price?|author=Mitch Lipka|date=11 February 2015|work=Reuters|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.candyindustry.com/articles/85215-report---19-5-billion-in-chocolate-sales-and-20--growth-in-organic|title=Report: $19.5 billion in chocolate sales—and 20% growth in organic - 2012-05-30 - Candy Industry|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major brands, such as [[The Hershey Company]], have begun to produce organic chocolate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/dagoba-sold-to-hersheys.html|title=Dagoba Sold To Hershey's|work=TreeHugger|accessdate=15 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production Process ==
The Seattle based chocolate maker Theo Chocolate was one of the first companies that were "fair-trade certified" and produced Organic Chocolate. In 2006 Theo Chocolate began their production of organic chocolate, there were no solid guidelines for the manufacturing and they had to get the process and ingredients in the correct measurements. The main ingredient in chocolate, cocoa is going to be found close to the equator and the majority of it is grown in Western Africa. The organic cocoa, the main ingredient in organic chocolate, is sent to the chocolate factor where they arrive in burlap sacks. The cocoa beans are then thoroughly cleaned and foreign objects are removed until just the beans remain. The manufacturer makes sure to use all organic ingredients to ensure that the final product is truly organic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://emagazine.com/sweet-dreams/|title=Sweet Dreams|date=2007-10-26|work=Emagazine.com|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simultaneous communication''', '''SimCom''', or '''sign supported speech''' ('''SSS''') is a technique sometimes used by [[deaf]], hard-of-hearing or hearing [[sign language]] users in which both a spoken language and a manual variant of that language (such as [[English language|English]] and [[manually coded English]]) are used simultaneously. While the idea of communicating using two modes of language seems ideal in a hearing/deaf setting, in practice the two languages are rarely relayed perfectly. Often the native language of the user (usually spoken language for the hearing person and sign language for the deaf person) is the language that is strongest, while the non-native language degrades in clarity. In an educational environment this is particularly difficult for deaf children as a majority of teachers who teach the deaf are hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gupress.gallaudet.edu/excerpts/LAADCtwo3.html|title=Language Attitudes in the American Deaf Community|website=gupress.gallaudet.edu|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from surveys taken indicate that communication for students is indeed signing (about 2/3 of the population of students), and that the signing leans more toward English rather than ASL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newell|first=William|last2=Stinson|first2=Michael|last3=Castle|first3=Diane|last4=Mallery-Ruganis|first4=Dominique|last5=Holcomb|first5=Barbara Ray|date=2013-10-02|title=Simultaneous Communication: A Description by Deaf Professionals Working in an Educational Setting|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507083|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=391–414|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0023|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History/overview ==
[[Manual communication]], including simultaneous communication, has existed for a while in the United States, but gained traction in the 70's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=Madeline M.|date=2013-10-02|title=Simultaneous Communication: The State of the Art &amp; Proposals for Change|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507082|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=333–390|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0019|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of using signing with children has been a tumultuous one, with many swings between discouraging the use of signed languages and focusing on [[oralism]], to the current push of [[bilingualism]] in Deaf schools. Ultimately, the majority of schools pushed the signed language they used to focus on English, resulting in the birth of a language that combined spoken language (English) with a manual language. The historical use of SC in schools has been stormy, with professionals (both researchers and teachers alike) on either side of the debate on whether the language is useful or not.

== Studies/research ==

===Positive approaches===

According to a study done in 1984, it was found that compared with haphazard instruction involving no language approach whatsoever, Total Communication was proved to be beneficial when combined with the correct approach.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=Mark T.|last2=Calderon|first2=Rosemary|last3=Kusché|first3=Carol|date=1984-01-01|title=Early Intervention Using Simultaneous Communication with Deaf Infants: The Effect on Communication Development|jstor=1129972|journal=Child Development|volume=55|issue=2|pages=607–616|doi=10.2307/1129972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study entitled "Intelligibility of speech produced during simultaneous communication",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intelligibility of speech produced during simultaneous communication|first1=Robert L|last1=Whitehead|first2=Nicholas|last2=Schiavetti|first3=Douglas J|last3=MacKenzie|first4=Dale Evan|last4=Metz|date=1 May 2004|publisher=|journal=Journal of Communication Disorders|volume=37|issue=3|pages=241–253|doi=10.1016/j.jcomdis.2003.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12 [[Hearing loss|hearing impaired]] individuals were asked to audit the audio samples of 4 hearing sign language experts who had produced recordings of a Simultaneous Communication (SC) sample and a Speech Alone (SA) sample. The 12 hearing impaired individuals were asked to then determine which speech produced was clearer. After listening to both audio samples, hearing impaired listeners agreed that both SC and SA were intelligible, which is supported by previous research. Since the intelligibility of the speech was kept on par with English grammar, the study results indicate that SC is a positive tool to use with [[Hearing loss|Deaf]] and [[Hearing loss|Hard of Hearing]] children as a language model and for Deaf/Hard of Hearing adults to keep using.

Another study showed the difference between a control group, families who participated in an intervention program that offered services such as classes on Total Communication, private teachers for the child and a deaf adult who came to the families house, and another group of families who used TC, but did not have as much intervention as the control group. The results showed that intervention did work, and that it positively correlated with the communication skills show by the control group's children. The children showed advanced cognitive skills, including comprehension and expression, specifically related to time.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Negative approaches ===

A study done in 1990 titled "The Effectiveness of Three Means of Communication in the College Classroom"&amp;nbsp;by Dennis Cokely reviewed research done previously that supported the use of Total Communication (SimCom) in the classroom. However, the study pointed out several restrictive factors that several research tests had not approached. One of the tests administered only compared SimCom, the [[Rochester Method]] and speech reading with voice ([[lip reading]]), omitting the option of ASL as a means of communication. The 1990 study addressed this issue by comparing SimCom, Sign Alone and Interpretation to see which was the most effective. The results from the comparison showed that signing alone as a way for students to understand information given was the most effective and SimCom was the least effective. Overall, Sign Alone and Interpretation was most effective in all areas of the test, proving that SimCom was a struggle for teachers and students alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cokely|first=Dennis|date=2013-10-02|title=The Effectiveness of Three Means of Communication in the College Classroom|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/507084|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=69|issue=1|pages=415–442|doi=10.1353/sls.1990.0027|issn=1533-6263}}&lt;/ref&gt; When working with two separate modes of communication, the one that comes naturally for the user will be the more prominent mode. A study conducted in 1998 showed that signing and speaking at the same time results in a slower approach to instruction than if just one modality was used to express language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title="Constructing Simultaneous Communication: The Contributions of Natural Sign Language"|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%22Constructing_Simultaneous_Communication:_The_Contributions_of_Natural_Sign_Language%22&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of Total Communication ==
Listed below are the signed communications that are used within SimCom. Since SimCom can use any spoken language, mainly English, combined with any signed mode, all communication listed below are available for use. 
* [[American Sign Language]]
* [[Signing Exact English]]
* [[Cued speech]]
* [[Contact sign]] (Pidgin Sign)
* [[Total Communication]]
* [[Bimodal bilingualism]]

Technosignatures are analogous to the [[biosignatures]] that signal the presence of life, whether or not intelligent.&lt;ref name=tarter-2018 /&gt;  Some authors prefer to exclude radio transmissions from the definition,&lt;ref name=almar-2011&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2011.05.036|author=Almár, Iván|volume=69|date=2011|pages=899–904|title=SETI and astrobiology: The Rio Scale and the London Scale|journal=Acta Astronautica|issue=9–10|bibcode = 2011AcAau..69..899A }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such restrictive usage is not widespread.
[[Jill Tarter]] has proposed that the [[search for extraterrestrial intelligence]] (SETI) be renamed "the search for technosignatures".&lt;ref name="tarter-2018" /&gt;
Various types of technosignatures, such as [[radiation leakage]] from [[megascale engineering|megascale]] [[astroengineering]] installations such as [[Dyson sphere]]s, the light from an extraterrestrial [[ecumenopolis]], or [[Shkadov thrusters]] with the power to alter the orbits of stars around the [[Galactic Center]], may be detectable with [[hypertelescope]]s.  Some examples of technosignatures are described in [[Paul Davies]]'s 2010 book ''[[The Eerie Silence]]'', although the terms "technosignature" and "technomarker" do not appear in the book.

==Astroengineering projects==
A Dyson sphere, constructed by life forms dwelling in proximity to a [[Solar analog|Sun-like star]], would cause an increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the star system's emitted spectrum. Hence, [[Freeman Dyson]] selected the title "Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infrared Radiation" for his 1960 paper on the subject.&lt;ref name="search"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date= 1960|url=http://www.islandone.org/LEOBiblio/SETI1.HTM|title=Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation|author= Freemann J.

From 2005, [[Fermilab]] has conducted an ongoing survey for such spectra, analyzing data from the [[Infrared Astronomical Satellite]].&lt;ref name=carrigan&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| date=2006| accessdate=2006-03-02| first=Dick| last=Carrigan| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf &lt;!-- permalink to official source with abstract &amp; alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials --&gt; |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415115307/http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifying one of the many infra-red sources as a Dyson sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson sphere and natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere |title='&amp;#39;Dyson sphere'&amp;#39; at Scholarpedia |publisher=Scholarpedia.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab discovered 17 "ambiguous" candidates, of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".&lt;ref name="Carrigan 2012"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| date=2012| accessdate=2012-01-15| first=D.| last=Carrigan| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which remain unconfirmed.&lt;ref name=carrigan /&gt; In October 2012, astronomer [[Geoff Marcy]], one of the pioneers of the search for [[extrasolar planets]], was given a research grant to search data from the ''[[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler]]'' telescope, with the aim of detecting possible signs of Dyson spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanders |first=Robert |url=http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/10/05/grants-help-scientists-explore-border-between-science-science-fiction/ |title=Grants help scientists explore boundary between science &amp; science fiction |publisher=Newscenter.berkeley.edu |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shkadov thrusters, with the hypothetical ability to change the orbital paths of stars in order to avoid various dangers to life such as [[molecular cloud|cold molecular cloud]]s or [[impact event|cometary impact]]s, would also be detectable in a similar fashion to the [[transit method|transiting]] extrasolar planets searched by ''Kepler''. Unlike planets, though, the thrusters would appear to abruptly stop over the surface of a star rather than crossing it completely, revealing their technological origin.&lt;ref name=Villard2013&gt;{{Cite web | title = Alien 'Star Engine' Detectable in Exoplanet Data? | url = http://news.discovery.com/space/alien-life-exoplanets/planet-searches-might-stumble-across-an-alien-stellar-engine-130625.htm | date = 2013 | author = Villard, Ray | accessdate = 2013-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, evidence of targeted extrasolar [[asteroid mining]] may also reveal extraterrestrial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|arxiv=1103.5369|author1=Duncan Forgan|author2=Martin Elvis|title=Extrasolar Asteroid Mining as Forensic Evidence for Extraterrestrial Intelligence|date=2011|doi=10.1017/S1473550411000127|volume=10|issue=4|journal=International Journal of Astrobiology|pages=307–313|bibcode=2011IJAsB..10..307F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planetary analysis==

===Artificial heat and light===
Various astronomers, including [[Avi Loeb]] of the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] and [[Edwin Turner]] of [[Princeton University]] have proposed that artificial light from extraterrestrial planets, such as that originating from cities, industries, and transport networks, could be detected and signal the presence of an advanced civilization. Such approaches, though, make the assumption that the radiant energy generated by civilization would be relatively clustered and can therefore be detected easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Science_News/2011/11/03/SETI-search-urged-to-look-for-city-lights/UPI-89301320361336/#ixzz2HRkOcctY |title=SETI search urged to look for city lights |publisher=UPI.com |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Extrasolar Planets: Formation, Detection and Dynamics Rudolf Dvorak, page 14 John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Light and heat detected from planets must be distinguished from natural sources to conclusively prove the existence of intelligent life on a planet.&lt;ref name=almar-2011 /&gt; For example, NASA's 2012 ''Black Marble'' experiment showed that significant stable light and heat sources on Earth, such as chronic wildfires in arid [[Western Australia]], originate from uninhabited areas and are naturally occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NPP/news/aus-fires.html |title=Wildfires Light Up Western Australia |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2012-12-07 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmospheric analysis===
Atmospheric analysis of planetary atmospheres, as is already done on various Solar System bodies and in a rudimentary fashion on several [[hot Jupiter]] extrasolar planets, may reveal the presence of chemicals produced by technological civilizations.&lt;ref name=choi-2012 /&gt; For example, atmospheric emissions from industry on Earth, including [[nitrogen dioxide]] and [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s, are detectable from space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Observing_the_Earth/Satellite_sniffs_out_chemical_traces_of_atmospheric_pollution |title=Satellite sniffs out chemical traces of atmospheric pollution / Observing the Earth / Our Activities / ESA |publisher=Esa.int |date=2000-12-18 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artificial pollution may therefore be detectable on extrasolar planets. However, there remains a possibility of mis-detection; for example, the [[atmosphere of Titan]] has detectable signatures of complex chemicals that are similar to what on Earth are industrial pollutants, though obviously not the byproduct of civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/21470-saturn-moon-titan-haze-cassini.html |title=Haze on Saturn's Moon Titan Is Similar to Earth's Pollution |publisher=Space.com |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some SETI scientists have proposed searching for artificial atmospheres created by planetary engineering to produce habitable environments for colonisation by an ETI.&lt;ref name=choi-2012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.space.com/18624-alien-life-search-hairspray.html |title=Alien Hairspray May Help Us Find E.T. |publisher=Space.com |date=2012-11-26 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extraterrestrial artifacts and spacecraft==
{{see also|Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact#Extraterrestrial artifacts}}

=== Spacecraft ===
[[Interstellar spacecraft]] may be detectable from hundreds to thousands of [[light-year]]s away through various forms of radiation, such as the [[photon]]s emitted by an [[antimatter rocket]] or [[cyclotron radiation]] from the interaction of a magnetic sail with the [[interstellar medium]]. Such a signal would be easily distinguishable from a natural signal and could hence firmly establish the existence of extraterrestrial life were it to be detected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title=Detection of Extraterrestrial Civilizations via the Spectral Signature of Advanced Interstellar Spacecraft | publisher=Astronomical Society of the Pacific | author=Zubrin, Robert | editor=Shostak, Seth | booktitle=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series | date=1995 | conference=Progress in the Search for Extraterrestrial Life | pages=487–496 | bibcode=1995ASPC...74..487Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, smaller [[Bracewell probe]]s within the Solar System itself may also be detectable by means of optical or radio searches.&lt;ref name=freitas-1983&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=The Case for Interstellar Probes|volume=36|date=November 1983|pages=490–495|url=http://www.rfreitas.com/Astro/TheCaseForInterstellarProbes1983.htm|author=Freitas, Robert|bibcode = 1983JBIS...36..490F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tough-1998-2&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society|title=Small Smart Interstellar Probes|author=Tough, Allen|volume=51|pages=167–174|date=1998
|url=http://www.ieti.org/tough/articles/jbis51.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satellites ===
A less advanced technology, and one closer to humanity's current technological level, is the Clarke Exobelt proposed by Astrophysicist Hector Socas-Navarro of the [[Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dorminey |first1=Bruce |title=NASA's TESS Telescope May Spot Alien Geo-Satellites, Say Astronomers |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucedorminey/2018/02/24/nasas-tess-telescope-could-detect-belt-of-alien-geo-satellites-says-new-paper/#36256f8e4eb4 |website=Forbes |accessdate=12 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothetical belt would be formed by all the artificial [[satellite]]s occupying [[geostationary]]/[[geosynchronous]] orbits around an [[exoplanet]]. Simulations suggest that a very dense satellite belt (requiring only a moderately more-advanced civilization than ours) would be detectable with existing technology in the [[Light curve|light curves]] from [[Methods of detecting exoplanets#Transit photometry|transiting]] exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Possible Photometric Signatures of Moderately Advanced Civilizations: The Clarke Exobelt|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=855|issue=2|pages=110|arxiv=1802.07723|author=Hector Socas-Navarro|date=2018-02-21|doi=10.3847/1538-4357/aaae66|bibcode=2018ApJ...855..110S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific projects searching for technosignatures==
One of the first attempts to search for Dyson Spheres was made by Vyacheslav Slysh from the Space Research Institute in Moscow in 1985 using data from the [[IRAS|Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS)]].&lt;ref&gt;Alien megaprojects: The hunt has begun New Scientist 09 April 2013 by Stephen Battersby&lt;/ref&gt;

Another search for technosignatures, circa 2001, involved an analysis of data from the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] for traces of anti-matter, which, besides one "intriguing spectrum probably not related to SETI", came up empty.&lt;ref name="harris-2001" /&gt;

In 2005, [[Fermilab]] had an ongoing survey for such spectra by analyzing data from IRAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| title=Fermilab Dyson Sphere search program| date=2006| accessdate=2006-03-02| first=D.| last=Carrigan| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060306222359/http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/Infrared_Astronomy/Fermilab_search.htm| archivedate=2006-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shostak |first=Seth |date=Spring 2009 |journal=Engineering &amp; Science |title=When Will We Find the Extraterrestrials? |volume=72 |number=1 |pages=12–21 |issn=0013-7812 |url=http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf &lt;!-- permalink to official source with abstract &amp; alternate PDF link: http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechES:72.1.Extraterrestrials --&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415115307/http://archive.seti.org/pdfs/Shostak-spring2009-EnS.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying one of the many infra-red sources as a Dyson Sphere would require improved techniques for discriminating between a Dyson Sphere and natural sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Dyson_sphere ''Dyson sphere'' at Scholarpedia]&lt;/ref&gt; Fermilab discovered 17 potential "ambiguous" candidates of which four have been named "amusing but still questionable".&lt;ref name="Carrigan 2012"/&gt; Other searches also resulted in several candidates, which are, however, unconfirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dick Carrigan |url=http://home.fnal.gov/~carrigan/infrared_astronomy/Other_searches.htm |title=Dyson Sphere Searches |publisher=Home.fnal.gov |date=2010-12-16 |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 paper, Luc Arnold proposed a means of detecting planetary-sized artifacts from their distinctive transit light curve signature. He showed that such technosignature was within the reach of space missions aimed at detecting exoplanets by the [[transit method]], as were ''Corot'' or ''Kepler'' projects at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Luc F. A. Arnold, 2005, Transit Light-Curve Signatures of Artificial Objects http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/2005ApJ...627..534A&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of the detection remains applicable for the future exoplanets missions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tess.gsfc.nasa.gov Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite TESS.] NASA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CHEOPS CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite http://cheops.unibe.ch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sci.esa.int/plato/ PLATO PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars]. ESA.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a trio of astronomers led by Jason Wright started a two-year search for Dyson Spheres, aided by grants from the [[Templeton Foundation]].&lt;ref name="UT-2013" /&gt;

In 2013, Geoff Marcy received funding to use data from the [[Kepler Telescope]] to search for Dyson Spheres and interstellar communication using lasers,&lt;ref name="SMH-2013" /&gt; and [[Lucianne Walkowicz]] received funding to detect artificial signatures in stellar photometry.[https://web.archive.org/web/20131022101358/http://scienceblogs.com/catdynamics/2012/10/04/new-frontiers-in-astronomy-the-research-grant-winners/]

Starting in 2016, astronomer [[Jean-Luc Margot]] of [[UCLA]] has been searching for technosignatures with large radio telescopes.&lt;ref name="UT-2018" /&gt;

The '''Test of Economic Knowledge''' or '''TEK''' is a [[standardized test]] of [[economics]] nationally [[norm-referenced test|norm-referenced]] in the United States for use in middle schools and in lower-grade levels of high schools.  It is one of four grade-level specific standardized economics tests (i.e., [[Basic Economics Test]] (BET), [[Test of Economic Literacy]] (TEL) and [[Test of Understanding in College Economics]] (TUCE)) sponsored and published by the [[National Council on Economic Education]] (NCEE) .

The TEK was recently revised into its second edition in 2007 and will soon be available, along with an examiner’s manual, for teachers, school administrators and researchers through the NCEE.  The revision process took place at the [[National Center for Research in Economic Education]] (NCREE) and included a new set of norm-references that consisted of teacher and student participation from twenty-five U.S. states.  The TEK has two parallel forms, each composed of forty 4-option [[multiple-choice]] items with [[content validity]] based on the [[Voluntary National Content Standards in Economics]].

'''Theology Digest''' (1953–2010) summarized selected recent articles from over 400 [[List of theological journals|theological journals]]. Some were in the form of formal summaries, approved by the authors of the articles, while some were briefer abstracts for whose accuracy the editors assumed responsibility. 
 
The digest was published quarterly.  In each year, three issues contained the abstracts and summaries, and the fourth contained selected lectures from the series of [[Bellarmine Lectures]] and elsewhere. All issues contained a book survey as well, covering over 200 books per issue. 

The  Digest was founded by Cyril A. Vollert, S.J., and Gerald F. Van Ackeren, S.J.,  at the Jesuit divinity school, [[St. Mary's College, Kansas|St. Mary's College]] in Kansas in 1953, but those of other denominations became involved as well.  

Theology Digest was based at Saint Louis University from 1967 until 2010.

The '''UK Energy Research Centre''' ('''UKERC''') is the focal point for UK research on [[sustainable energy]], and is central to the [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils']] Energy Programme.&lt;ref name=ukerc-about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=About_us&amp;structure=Home|title=About us|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centre has its headquarters at the campus of [[Imperial College, London]], providing support to 70 researchers based in 11 universities and research institutions across the UK: UCL; Strathclyde; Leeds; Imperial College London; Exeter; Sussex; the University of East Anglia; the Plymouth Marine Laboratory; Cardiff; Oxford; Aberdeen.

The organisation takes an independent, whole-systems approach, drawing on technical and non-technical disciplines including engineering, economics and the physical, environmental and social sciences. The Centre helps to co-ordinate the overall UK [[energy research]] effort and acts as a bridge between the UK energy research community, the international research community, business and policymakers.&lt;ref name=ukerc-about /&gt;

==History==
UKERC was established in April 2004, following a recommendation from the 2002 Energy Review initiated by Sir David King, the UK Government's Chief Scientific Advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/about-us/history.html|title=History|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was set up to address key controversies in the energy field through comprehensive assessments of the current state of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 Global Oil Depletion: An assessment of the evidence for a near-term peak in global oil production] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012004031/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=283 |date=2009-10-12 }}, page i, August 2009, published October 08, 2009, UK Energy Research Centre, {{ISBN|1-903144-03-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first phase of the Centre ran from 2004 - 2009.

In March 2009, £18.5 million was allocated to support the second phase of work at the UK Energy Research Centre for 2009 – 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nerc.ac.uk/press/releases/2009/07-ukerp.asp £18 million to secure the future of UK energy research], July 2009, NERC&lt;/ref&gt; Under the second phase of funding, UKERC focused on five themes: Energy Demand, Energy Supply, Energy Systems, Energy and Environment, and Technology and Policy Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/tiki-index.php?page=Research|title=Programmes|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, the UK Energy Research Centre was awarded funding for a third phase of work, which would run from 2014 to 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/ukenergyresearchcentre/|title=RCUK commits £14 million to UK Energy Research Centre - EPSRC website|website=www.epsrc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current Activity==
UKERC's third phase combines a research programme focused on six core themes: future energy system pathways; resources and vectors; energy systems at multiple scales; energy, economy and societal preferences; decision making; technology, policy and assessment - with an HQ function aimed at engaging with the wider UK energy research community, policy makers and energy industry. 

The Centre acts as the bridge between the UK energy research community and the wider world; fulfilling the role of a national energy research laboratory by both informing and representing the energy research community and acting as a catalyst for UK-wide collaboration in order to address the key energy challenges ahead.

UKERC's interdisciplinary research studentships have enabled whole-systems interdisciplinary research across scientific, engineering and socio-economic boundaries.

Full details of all UKERC's activities and research output can be found at UKERC's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukerc.ac.uk|title=UKERC|website=www.ukerc.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research Atlas===
UKERC's Research Atlas is an information resource for current and past UK energy research and development activity. The online database has information on energy-related research capabilities in the UK and a series of energy roadmaps showing research problems to be overcome before new technologies can be made commercially viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukerc.rl.ac.uk/|title=UKERC Energy Data Centre|website=ukerc.rl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===National Energy Research Network (NERN)===
The National Energy Research Network (NERN) is open to all energy researchers and other sectors, including business, and provides updates on news, jobs, events, opportunities and developments across the energy field in the form of a weekly newsletter.

===Summer School===
UKERC runs an annual '''Summer School''', which runs for a week and combines seminars from internationally leading speakers with project work and professionally facilitated developmental activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1299">The '''University of Reading Atmospheric Observatory''' is an [[atmospheric observatory]] and [[weather station]] located on the [[Whiteknights Campus]] of the [[University of Reading]]. It forms part of the university's ''Department of Meteorology''.

The observatory has been a centre for atmospheric measurements and meteorological observations since 1970. Keeping of weather records was originally started by the University College of Reading (a precursor of the university) in 1901, with a near complete daily record from January 1908&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/home/atmospheric-observatory/|title=University of Reading|website=University of Reading|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The location of the site was moved, Originally sited on the London Road campus (nearer central Reading), it was moved to Whiteknights campus in January 1968, but took up its current location (still on Whiteknights campus) in January 1970.

'''Vermiform''' describes something shaped like a [[worm]]. The expression is often employed in [[biology]] and [[anatomy]] to describe more or less tubular or cylindrical, usually soft body parts or animals. The word root is [[Latin]], ''vermes''-worms and ''formes''-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glare|first=edited by P.G.W.|title=[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-864224-5|edition=Combined ed., repr. with corr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A well known example is the [[vermiform appendix]], a small, blind section of the gut in humans and a number of other [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name=SEAL09&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith H. F., Fisher R. E., Everett M. L., Thomas A. D., Bollinger, R. R., Parker W. | year = 2009 | title = Comparative anatomy and phylogenetic distribution of the mammalian cecal appendix | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 1984–1999 | doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01809.x | pmid=19678866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Soft-bodied organisms|soft-bodied]] animal [[phylum (biology)|phyla]] are typically described as vermiform. The more well known one are undoubtedly the [[Annelida|annelids]] (earthworm and relatives) and the [[Nematoda|roundworms]] (a very common, mainly parasitic group), but a number of less well known phyla answer to the same description. Examples range from the minute parasitic [[mesozoa]]ns to the larger bodied free-living phyla like [[Nemertea|ribbon worms]], [[Nemertea|peanut worms]] and [[Priapulida|priapulids]].
