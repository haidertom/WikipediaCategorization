'''88 Precepts''' is an essay or manifesto written by [[David Lane (white supremacist)|David Lane]], a member of the [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] organization [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]]. Written while Lane was serving a 190-year prison sentence, 88 Precepts is a treatise on [[natural law]], [[religion]], race and politics from the view point of David Lane including instructions for securing, protecting, preserving and establishing white [[Northwest Territorial Imperative|territorial imperatives]] in the [[Northwestern United States]] and [[Eastern Europe]], distributing [[propaganda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The 88 Precepts are commonly regarded as "tenets of white-separatist life" used by white supremacy groups and those who advocate [[white nationalism]] and [[White separatism|separatism]]. Lane was heavily critical of democracy, multiculturalism and [[racial integration]]. The 88 Precepts further elaborate on Lane's [[White genocide conspiracy theory]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Lane claimed that 14-88 was an integral part of his ''Pyramid Prophecy''&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=FIwwWSSL5JIC&amp;pg=PA381&lt;/ref&gt; and the fundamental doctrine in his religion of [[Wotansvolk|Wotanism]]. 1488 is a combination of 14 as in Lane's [[14 Words]] and [[88 (number)#In_white_nationalism|88]], a white nationalist/supremacist slogan for "Heil Hitler"&lt;ref&gt;1488 is a combination of two popular white supremacist numeric symbols. The first symbol is 14, which is shorthand for the "14 Words" slogan http://www.adl.org/combating-hate/hate-on-display/c/1488.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ars Electronica''' Linz GmbH is an [[Austria]]n cultural, educational and scientific institute active in the field of [[new media art]], founded in [[Linz]] in 1979. It is based at the [[Ars Electronica Center]], which houses the Museum of the Future, in the city of [[Linz]]. Ars Electronica’s activities focus on the interlinkages between art, technology and society. It runs an annual festival, and manages a multidisciplinary media arts [[R&amp;D]] facility known as the Futurelab. It also confers the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] awards.

==History==
[[File:Linz Ars electronica center rotblau DL.jpg|thumb|left|Night view of the Center]]
Ars Electronica began with its first festival in September 1979. Its founders were Hannes Leopoldseder, [[Hubert Bognermayr]], [[Herbert W. Franke]], and Ulrich Rützel. The festival was held biennially at first, and annually since 1986. The Prix Ars Electronica was inaugurated in 1987 and has been awarded every year since then. Ars Electronica Linz [[GmbH]] was incorporated as a limited company in 1995. The Ars Electronica Center, together with the Futurelab, opened in 1996, and was remodelled in 2009.

Funding is provided by the City of Linz, the Province of [[Upper Austria]] and the Republic of Austria, in addition to private partners. In 2014 the organization is headed by artistic director Gerfried Stocker and financial director Diethard Schwarzmair.&lt;ref name=website&gt;[http://www.aec.at/about/en/ Ars Electronica website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Ars Electronica festival is a gathering of artists, scientists and technologists, intended as "a setting for experimentation, evaluation and reinvention".&lt;ref name=website /&gt; The festival has always exerted a public presence in Linz, mounting large-scale open-air projects and holding  lectures, discussions and workshops in a wide range of public venues.&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|54}}

Each year the festival is devoted to a specific theme. The festival in 2014, from 4–8 September, had as its theme "C... What it Takes to Change", i.e. ways in which social change and innovation can be promoted. It attracted 579 participants and about 85,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/c/en/ Ars Electronica website, “Ars Electronica 2014”]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features at the 2014 festival===

====Device art====
[[File:Ars electronica center 2012 j.jpg|thumb|left|"Außer Kontrolle" (Out of Control), exhibit at the Center during Ars Electronica 2012]]
A form of [[concept art]], Device Art has been described as "...a rebellion of form, taking everyday objects and inverting them to tell you something different".&lt;ref&gt;Kerry Skyring, [http://www.dw.de/when-technology-takes-over-your-life-turn-your-machine-into-the-message/a-17932400 When technology takes over your life, turn your machine into the message], [[Deutsche Welle]], 19 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Among the examples exhibited at the 2014 festival were:
* "Otamatone" – a musical instrument shaped like a musical note.
* "Food Simulator", in which a pressure sensor in the user's mouth simulates the sensation of chewing food.
* "Lenticular Bicycle" - an old fashioned bicycle with a screen carousel mounted above the handlebars, known as "Sustainable Cinema No. 2" and created by Scott Hessels.
* A robot that performs street begging, made from recycled computer parts, with a voice and robotic hands.
* "Touchy", a "human camera", devised by the Hong Kong-based artist Eric Suiss.

====Space pixels ("spaxels")====
A display called "Smart atoms: spaxels version" was developed by Ars Electronica Futurelab and shown at the 2014 festival. The "space pixels"&lt;ref&gt;Horst Hörtner, Matthew Gardiner, Roland Haring, Christopher Lindinger, Florian Berger.

{{Main|Prix Ars Electronica}}
The Prix Ars Electronica is an annual award made in several categories, "honoring creativity and innovativeness in the use of digital media".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/prix/en Ars Electronica website, "Prix Ars Electronica"]&lt;/ref&gt; Award winners are selected by a five-person international expert jury, who may themselves propose candidates. The prize may be awarded to individuals or to teams or organizations, and may be awarded for a specific work of art or for another form of innovation.

The Prix was first awarded in 1987, and there have been several changes in the categories since then. In 2014 there were 2,703 entries from 77 countries. All entries remain on display in an online archive, the Prix Ars Electronica Showcase, containing over 55,000 items.

===Award categories===
Awards of the "Golden Nica" (worth 10,000 euros), "Awards of Distinction", and "Honorary Mentions" are made in the following categories:
* Computer animation / Film / VFX

{{Main|Ars Electronica Center}}
The Center, also known as the "Museum of the Future", is housed in a modern complex of buildings by the [[Danube]]. It acts as Ars Electronica’s permanent base and showcase. The majority of the space is used for public exhibitions and events, with an emphasis on interactivity and participation. Major themes are life sciences, environmental issues, and preparation for impending technological developments with likely impacts on society.

There is also provision for conferences, workshops, and R&amp;D. The Center was enhanced and expanded in 2009, coincident with Linz’s term as [[European Capital of Culture]]. It is the most-visited museum in Linz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/center/en/ Ars Electronica website, “Ars Electronica Center”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Futurelab==
The Futurelab, housed at the Ars Electronica Center, is a center of expertise for multidisciplinary research and development of new cyberarts technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/futurelab/en/aktuelles/about/ Ars Electronica website, "About Ars Electronica Futurelab"]&lt;/ref&gt; It is staffed by about 25 permanent team members, and offers residencies to established and emerging artists and researchers.

The Futurelab has produced infrastructure and content for the Center and Festival. More recently it has engaged in joint ventures with universities and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.at/futurelab/en/network/ Ars Electronica website, "Futurelab Network"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The winner of [the next idea] voestalpine Art and Technology Grant is entitled to a term as Artist/Scientist-in-Residence at the Futurelab.

==Comment==
Trent Nathaniel Grover has included an Appendix about Ars Electronica in his book "Dream of the Techno-Shaman" (2008).&lt;ref name=Grover&gt;Trent Nathaniel Grover (2008), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EOOulf5psXEC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Ars+Electronica%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NpdCVKipDYbP7gaY4oGQCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ars%20Electronica%22&amp;f=false Dream of the Techno-Shaman], Appendix A ("Ars Electronica: Towards the Integration of Art, Technology, and Society"), pp. 53-68, ProQuest&lt;/ref&gt; He describes the institute’s activities as “a unique platform for exploring, discussing, tracking, and analyzing the interrelation between art, technology, and society”.&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|53}} Such work, he argues, affirms the place of the human being at the center of techno-cultural processes, as “beneficiaries, victims, and, above all, creators and appliers of new technology”.&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|67}} Noting that the rapid pace of technological innovation has profound implications for culture and society, he presents the role of Ars Electronica as working to integrate developments in technology with art and society to the benefit of all, and contrasts this perspective with the [[Modernism|Modernist]] call for "art for art’s sake".&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|54}}

Grover concludes by hoping that Ars Electronica "will be able to maintain its ongoing quest for innovation and expansion so that we can all benefit from and further involve ourselves in the integration of art, technology, and society".&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|67–68}}

Grover (2008) has described the published work of Ars Electronica as "a compelling snapshot of codependent technological and artistic development with expansive and lasting social and cultural impact."&lt;ref name=Grover /&gt;{{rp|53}}

{{Hindu philosophy}} 
'''Avidyā''' is a [[Sanskrit]] word whose literal meaning is [[ignorance]], misconceptions, misunderstandings, incorrect knowledge, and it is the opposite of ''[[Vidya (Knowledge)|Vidya]]''.&lt;ref name=mmwp918/&gt; It is used extensively in [[Hindu]] texts, including the [[Upanishads]], and in other Indian religions such as [[Avidyā (Buddhism)|Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], particularly in the context of metaphysical reality.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt;&lt;ref name=ryanjones57/&gt;&lt;ref name="GombrichScherrer2008p209"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Francis Gombrich|author2=Cristina Anna Scherrer-Schaub|title=Buddhist Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7_Rea05eAMC|year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3248-0|pages=209–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avidyā, in all [[Dharma|Dharmic systems]], represents fundamental ignorance and misperception of the phenomenal world.&lt;ref name=ryanjones57/&gt; However, the Indian religions disagree on the details, for example with Hinduism considering a denial and misconceptions of [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (soul, self) as a form of Avidya, and Buddhism considering the denial and misconceptions of [[Anatta|An-atman]] (non-soul, non-self) as a form of Avidya.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sengaku Mayeda |title=A Thousand Teachings: The Upadesasahasri of Sankara |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Jc9RHYN3qsC |year=2006|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2771-4 |pages=76–78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Trainor | first =Kevin | year =2004 | title =Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide | publisher =Oxford University Press | isbn =978-0-19-517398-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PrloTKuAjwC|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and meaning ==
''Avidyā'' (अविद्या) is a Vedic Sanskrit word, and is a compound of "a" and "vidya", meaning "not vidya". The word ''vidya'' is derived from the Sanskrit root ''Vid'', which means "to know, to perceive, to see, to understand".&lt;ref name=mmwp918&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ''avidya'' means to "not know, not perceive, not understand". The ''Vid*''-related terms appears extensively in the [[Rigveda]] and other [[Vedas]].&lt;ref name=mmwp918/&gt; Avidya is usually rendered as "ignorance" in English translations of ancient Indian texts, sometimes as "spiritual ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Whicher |title=The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Qo9K9hPvQgC&amp;pg=PA110|year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-0-7914-3815-2 |page=110, see both translations on the same page by Ian Whicher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mariasusai Dhavamony |title=Phenomenology of Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALfSPvRO7DgC&amp;pg=PA297|date=1973 |publisher=Gregorian |isbn=978-88-7652-474-5|page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word avidyā is derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root *''weid''-, meaning "to see" or "to know". It is a [[cognate]] of Latin ''vidēre'' (which would turn to "video") and English "wit".

While Avidya found in Indian philosophies is translated as "ignorance", states Alex Wayman, this is a mistranslation because Avidya means more than ignorance. He suggests the term "unwisdom" to be a better rendition.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Meaning of Unwisdom (Avidya)| author= Alex Wayman|journal = Philosophy East and West| volume= 7| number= 1/2| year= 1957| pages= 21–25 | jstor= 1396830| doi=10.2307/1396830}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term includes not only ignorance out of darkness, but also obscuration, misconceptions, mistaking illusion to be reality or impermanent to be permanent or suffering to be bliss or non-self to be self (delusions).&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt; Incorrect knowledge is another form of Avidya, states Wayman.&lt;ref name=alexwayman21/&gt;

==Texts==
{{expand section|date=May 2016}}
Avidya in the earliest Vedic texts is ignorance, and in later Vedic texts evolves to include anything that is a "positive hindrance" to spiritual or nonspiritual knowledge.&lt;ref name=scharfstein376/&gt; In the Upanishads, the concept includes "lack of knowledge, inadequate knowledge and false knowledge".&lt;ref name=scharfstein376&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Ami Scharfstein |title=Comparative History of World Philosophy, A: From the Upanishads to Kant |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1xXJBZLn04IC |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press |isbn=978-1-4384-1887-2|pages=376–377 with footnotes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Advaita Vedanta==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2010}}
The effect of avidya is to suppress the real nature of things and present something else in its place. In effect it is not different from [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] (pronounced Māyā) or illusion. Avidya relates to the individual Self (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]''), while Maya is an adjunct of the cosmic Self (''[[Brahman]]''). In both cases it connotes the principle of differentiation of an experienced reality into the subject ('I') and an object, as is implicit in human thinking. Avidya stands for that delusion which breaks up the original unity (refer: [[nonduality]]) of what is real and presents it as subject and object and as doer and result of the deed. What keeps humanity captive in [[Samsara]] is this avidya. This ignorance,"the ignorance veiling our true self and the truth of the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mohrhoff|first=Ulrich|title=The Veil of Avidya|url=http://thisquantumworld.com/PDF/Avidya.pdf|publisher=Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education, Pondicherry, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not lack of [[erudition]]; it is ignorance about the nature of 'Being' (''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|Sat]]''). It is a limitation that is natural to human sensory or intellectual apparatus. This is responsible for all the misery of humanity. [[Advaita Vedanta]] holds that the eradication of it should be humanity's only goal and that will automatically mean realisation of the Self (''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'').

[[Adi Shankara]] says in his Introduction to his commentary on the [[Brahma Sutras]], "Owing to an absence of discrimination, there continues a natural human behaviour in the form of 'I am this' or 'This is mine'; this is avidya. It is a superimposition of the attributes of one thing on another. The ascertainment of the nature of the real entity by separating the superimposed thing from it is vidya (knowledge, illumination)". In Shankara's philosophy avidya cannot be categorized either as 'absolutely existent' or as 'absolutely non-existent'.

In mathematics, '''BF algebras''' are a class of algebraic structures arising out of a symmetric "Yin Yang" concept for Bipolar Fuzzy logic, the name was introduced by Andrzej Walendziak in 2007.  The name covers discrete versions, but a canonical example arises in the BF space [-1,0]x[0,1] of pairs of (false-ness, truth-ness).

==Definition==
A '''BF-algebra''' is a non-empty [[subset]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with a [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and a [[binary operation]] &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following:
# &lt;math&gt;x*x=0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;x*0=x&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;0*(x*y)=y*x&lt;/math&gt;

== Example ==
Let &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Set_(mathematics)|set]] of [[integer]]s and '&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;' be the binary operation '[[subtraction]]'. Then the [[algebra]]ic structure &lt;math&gt;(Z,-)&lt;/math&gt; obeys the following [[Property (philosophy)|properties]]:
# &lt;math&gt;x-x=0&lt;/math&gt; 
# &lt;math&gt;x-0=x&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;0-(x-y)=y-x&lt;/math&gt;

The '''bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohol fuels''' can be accomplished using the MixAlco process. Through bioconversion of [[biomass]] to a mixed [[alcohol fuel]], more energy from the biomass will end up as liquid fuels than in converting biomass to [[ethanol]] by [[yeast]] fermentation.

The process involves a biological/chemical method for converting any [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] material (e.g., urban wastes, such as [[municipal solid waste]], [[biodegradable waste]], and [[sewage treatment|sewage sludge]], agricultural residues such as [[corn stover]], sugarcane [[bagasse]], [[cotton gin]] trash, [[manure]]) into useful chemicals, such as [[carboxylic acids]] (e.g., [[Acetic acid|acetic]], [[Propionic acid|propionic]], [[butyric acid]]), [[ketones]] (e.g., acetone, [[methyl ethyl ketone]], [[diethyl ketone]]) and [[biofuels]], such as a mixture of primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, [[Propan-1-ol|propanol]], [[n-Butanol|''n''-butanol]]) and/or a mixture of secondary alcohols (e.g., [[isopropanol]], [[2-butanol]], 3-pentanol). Because of the many products that can be economically produced, this process is a true [[biorefinery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://soilcrop.tamu.edu/podcasts/seminars/MarkHoltzapple/9-5-07-640.wmv Advanced Biomass Refinery – Third-Generation 2007 (video)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701101942/http://soilcrop.tamu.edu//podcasts/seminars/MarkHoltzapple/9-5-07-640.wmv |date=1 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/Region6/6pd/pd-u-sw/wte_ftworth/cafo/holtzapple.pdf EPA Presentation on the process]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiche.confex.com/aiche/2005/techprogram/P14000.HTM Application]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:MixAlco Pilot Plant.JPG|right|thumbnail|500px|Pilot Plant ([[College Station, Texas|College Station]], [[Texas]])]]
The process uses a mixed culture of naturally occurring microorganisms found in natural habitats such as the [[rumen]] of cattle, [[termite]] guts, and marine and terrestrial swamps to [[anaerobic digestion|anaerobically digest]] biomass into a mixture of carboxylic acids produced during the [[acidogenesis|acidogenic]] and [[acetogenesis|acetogenic]] stages of [[anaerobic digestion]], however with the inhibition of the [[methanogenesis|methanogenic]] final stage. The more popular methods for production of ethanol and [[cellulosic ethanol]] use enzymes that must be isolated first to be added to the biomass and thus convert the starch or cellulose into simple sugars, followed then by yeast fermentation into ethanol. This process does not need the addition of such enzymes as these microorganisms make their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As the microoganisms anaerobically digest the biomass and convert it into a mixture of carboxylic acids, the [[pH]] must be controlled. This is done by the addition of a [[buffering agent]] (e.g., [[ammonium bicarbonate]], [[calcium carbonate]]), thus yielding a mixture of [[carboxylate]] salts. [[Methanogenesis]], being the natural final stage of anaerobic digestion, is inhibited by the presence of the [[ammonium]] ions or by the addition of an inhibitor (e.g., [[iodoform]]).  The resulting fermentation broth contains the produced carboxylate salts that must be dewatered. This is achieved efficiently by [[vapor-compression evaporation]]. Further chemical refining of the dewatered fermentation broth may then take place depending on the final chemical or biofuel product desired.

The condensed distilled water from the vapor-compression evaporation system is recycled back to the fermentation. On the other hand, if raw sewage or other waste water with high [[Biochemical oxygen demand|BOD]] in need of treatment is used as the water for the fermentation, the condensed distilled water from the evaporation can be recycled back to the city or to the original source of the high-BOD waste water. Thus, this process can also serve as a [[water treatment]] facility, while producing valuable chemicals or biofuels.

Because the system uses a mixed culture of microorganisms, besides not needing any enzyme addition, the fermentation requires no sterility or aseptic conditions, making this front step in the process more economical than in more popular methods for the production of cellulosic ethanol. These savings in the front end of the process, where volumes are large, allows flexibility for further chemical transformations after dewatering, where volumes are small.

==Carboxylic acids==
{{Details|Carboxylic acid}}
[[Carboxylic acids]] can be regenerated from the carboxylate salts using a process known as "acid springing". This process makes use of a high-molecular-weight [[tertiary amine]] (e.g., trioctylamine), which is switched with the [[cation]] (e.g., ammonium or calcium). The resulting amine carboxylate can then be thermally decomposed into the amine itself, which is recycled, and the corresponding [[carboxylic acid]]. In this way, theoretically, no chemicals are consumed or wastes produced during this step.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, S.A. 2000. Conversion of carboxylate salts to carboxylic acids via reactive distillation. M.S. Thesis&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ketones==
{{Details|Ketone}}
There are two methods for making ketones. The first one consists on thermally converting calcium carboxylate salts into the corresponding ketones. This was a common method for making acetone from [[calcium acetate]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, H. 2002. Pyrolytic decomposition of carboxylate salts. M.S. thesis&lt;/ref&gt; The other method for making ketones consists on converting the vaporized carboxylic acids on a [[catalyst|catalytic bed]] of [[zirconium oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, D. 2002. Ketonization of acetic acid. B.S. student report.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohols==
{{Details|Alcohol}}

===Primary alcohols===

The undigested residue from the fermentation may be used in [[gasification]] to make [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). This H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can then be used to [[hydrogenolysis|hydrogenolyze]] the [[esters]] over a catalyst (e.g., copper chromite),&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, M.W., Harris, N., Turner, K. 1982. Process for Hydrogenolysis of Carboxylic Acid Esters WO 82/03854, Nov. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; which are produced by esterifying either the ammonium carboxylate salts (e.g., [[ammonium acetate]], propionate, butyrate) or the carboxylic acids (e.g., acetic, propionic, butyric acid) with a high-molecular-weight alcohol (e.g., [[hexanol]], [[heptanol (disambiguation)|heptanol]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1951/73/i11/f-pdf/f_ja01155a075.pdf?sessid=6006l3 Preparation of esters by reaction of ammonium salts with alcohols.]&lt;/ref&gt; From the hydrogenolysis, the final products are the high-molecular-weight alcohol, which is recycled back to the [[esterification]], and the corresponding primary alcohols (e.g., ethanol, propanol, butanol).

===Secondary alcohols===

The secondary alcohols (e.g., isopropanol, 2-butanol, 3-pentanol) are obtained by [[hydrogenation|hydrogenating]] over a catalyst (e.g., Raney nickel) the corresponding ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone).&lt;ref&gt;Aldrett-Lee, S. 2000. Catalytic hydrogenation of liquid ketones with emphasis on gas–liquid mass transfer. PhD dissertation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drop-in biofuels==
The primary or secondary alcohols obtained as described above may undergo conversion to drop-in [[biofuels]], fuels which are compatible with current fossil fuel infrastructure such as [[biogasoline]], [[green diesel]] and bio-jet fuel.  Such is done by subjecting the alcohols to dehydration followed by oligomerization using zeolite catalysts in a manner similar to the [[methanex]] process, which used to produce gasoline from [[methanol]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/energy/7D.pdf |title=Production of gasoline from methanol. |access-date=27 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201041305/http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/energy/7D.pdf |archive-date=1 December 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acetic acid versus ethanol==

Cellulosic-ethanol manufacturing plants are bound to be net exporters of electricity because a large portion of the [[lignocellulosic biomass]], namely [[lignin]], remains undigested and it must be burned, thus producing electricity for the plant and excess electricity for the grid.  As the market grows and this technology becomes more widespread, coupling the liquid fuel and the [[electricity market]]s will become more and more difficult.{{fact|date=October 2014}}

Acetic acid, unlike ethanol, is biologically produced from simple sugars without the production of [[carbon dioxide]]:

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;center&gt;(Biological production of ethanol)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH &lt;center&gt;(Biological production of [[acetic acid]])&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Because of this, on a mass basis, the yields will be higher than in ethanol fermentation. If then, the undigested residue (mostly lignin) is used to produce hydrogen by gasification, it is ensured that more energy from the biomass will end up as liquid fuels rather than excess heat/electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/841137-u4bFGI/841137.PDF Eggeman, T., Verser, D., and Weber, E. (2005), An Indirect Route for Ethanol Production US Department of Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
  3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;center&gt;(Hydrogenation of acetic acid)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center; margin: 1em 10%; border: 1px solid"&gt;
C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (from [[cellulose]]) &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (from lignin)  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; → &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH &amp;nbsp; + &amp;nbsp; 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;center&gt;(Overall reaction)&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A more comprehensive description of the economics of each of the fuels is given on the pages [[alcohol fuel]] and [[ethanol fuel]], more information about the economics of various systems can be found on the central page [[biofuel]].

==Stage of development==
The system has been in development since 1991, moving from the laboratory scale (10 g/day) to the pilot scale (200&amp;nbsp;lb/day) in 2001. A small demonstration-scale plant (5 ton/day) has been constructed and is under operation and a 220 ton/day demonstration plant is expected in 2012.

In [[mathematics]], a '''Clifford–Klein form''' is a [[double coset]] space

:&amp;Gamma;\''G''/''H'',

where ''G'' is a [[Semisimple Lie group|reductive]] [[Lie group]], ''H'' a closed subgroup of ''G'', and Γ a [[discrete subgroup]] of G that acts [[properly discontinuously]] on the [[homogeneous space]] ''G''/''H''.  A suitable discrete subgroup Γ may or may not exist, for a given ''G'' and ''H''. If Γ exists, there is the question of whether Γ\''G''/''H'' can be taken to be a [[compact space]], called a '''compact Clifford–Klein form'''.

When ''H'' is  itself compact, classical results show that a compact Clifford–Klein form exists. Otherwise it may not, and there are a number of negative results.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16147">'''Collective self-esteem''' is a concept originating in the field of psychology that describes the aspect of an individual’s [[self-image]] that stems from how the individual interacts with others and the groups that the individual is a part of.  The idea originated during the research of [[Jennifer Crocker]], during which she was trying to learn about the connection between a person’s [[self-esteem]] and their attitude towards or about the group that the person is part of.

Collective self-esteem is talked about subjectively as a concept as well as measured objectively with various scales and assessments.  The data from such research is used practically to give importance and weight to the idea that most individuals benefit from being in a group setting for at least sometime as well as being able to identify with being a part of a group.

==History==

Jennifer Crocker and Riia Luhtanen were the first to study collective self-esteem.  They believed there was a relationship between people’s self-esteem and how they felt about groups they were a part of.  Crocker hypothesized that people who were high in the trait of collective self-esteem would be more likely to “react to threats to collective self-esteem by derogating [[Ingroups and outgroups|out-groups]] and enhancing the [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]].”&lt;ref name ="Crocker" /&gt;
	The idea of collective self-esteem rose out of [[social identity theory]] (Tajfel &amp; Turner).&lt;ref name ="Crocker" /&gt; Social identity theory focused on an individual’s personal beliefs about themselves and beliefs that stemmed from the groups they were part of.  Collective self-esteem described a more group-oriented idea of self-esteem.  It focused more on how groups, when they are threatened or perceive to be threatened will increase bias in favor of the in-group and increase prejudice toward the out-group.&lt;ref name ="Crocker" /&gt; Crocker published a paper titled “Collective self-esteem and in-group bias.”  It was published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.  
	Crocker developed a scale that consisted of four categories to measure collective self-esteem.&lt;ref name ="Crocker" /&gt;    

1) Private collective self-esteem.  Positive evaluation of one’s group

2) Membership esteem.  How one sees him/herself in a group.  Is he/she a good member?  

3) Public collective self-esteem.  How the group one belongs to is evaluated by others.   

4) Importance to identity.  How important membership in a group is to self-concept. 

	The study concluded that prejudice and discrimination toward out-groups were not so much motivated by personal self-esteem needs but rather they were attempts to increase or enhance collective self-esteem.&lt;ref name ="Crocker" /&gt;

==Research==

===Collective Self-Esteem Scale ===
The Collective Self-Esteem Scale (CSES) was developed by Luhtanen and Crocker as a measure to assess individuals’ social identity based on their membership in ascribed groups such as race, ethnicity, gender, and the like.&lt;ref name="Luhtanen" /&gt; The CSES has been one of the most widely used instruments in the field of psychology to assess collective group identity among racial and ethnic populations. In the initial CSES development study, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) techniques were used to examine the underlying factor structure of the proposed four-factor CSES. The preliminary prototype of the CSES consisted of 43 items. To shorten the instrument, Crocker and Luhtanen selected the 4 items with the highest factor loadings from each subscale to represent the final 16-item CSES. The actual scale is a list of statements that pertain to the person’s membership in a group or category and each is rated on a 7-point scale. The scoring is done through four subscales that are categorized as follows: 
1) Items 1, 5, 9, and 13 = Membership self-esteem. 
2) Items 2, 6, 10, and 14 = Private collective self-esteem. 
3) Items 3, 7, 11, and 15 = Public collective self-esteem. 
4) Items 4, 8, 12, and 16 = Importance to identity. 
First, reverse-score answers to items 2,4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, and 15, such that (1=7), (2=6), (3=5), (4=4), (5=3), (6=2), (7=1). Then sum the answers to the four items for each respective subscale score, and divide each by 4. 
Because the subscales measure distinct construct, it is strongly recommended against creating an overall or composite score for collective self-esteem.

===Race===
In the context of cross-cultural research using the CSES, Crocker Luhtanen, Blaine, and Broadnax explored the nature of collective self-esteem in Asian, Black, and White college students. Crocker et al. found that collective self-esteem was a significant predictor of psychological adjustment and that among the Black students in their sample, the correlation between public and private collective self-esteem was essentially zero. Based on this later finding, Crocker et al. surmised that Black college students might separate how they privately feel about their group from how they believe others may evaluate them.&lt;ref name="Branscombe" /&gt; This separation between public and private evaluations may represent an important survival strategy for Black Americans because of the prejudice and discrimination they face in the United States. The literature has suggested that Black Americans may generally feel good about their own racial group&lt;ref name="Verkuyten" /&gt; but still believe that external perceptions of their racial group may be negative or derogatory.&lt;ref name="Utsey" /&gt; This phenomenon might indicate a CSES factor structure for Black Americans that is different from that of other racial or ethnic groups in the United States.

===In-group and out-group bias===
Cremer et al. began a study expecting that people high in CSE engaged in indirect enhancement of the in-group. This finding suggests that predictions made by Social Identity Theory are more applicable to individuals with a high level of CSE. In this study, Cremer et al. found that participants identified more with the in-group than with the out-group. Participants high in CSE evaluated in-group members as fairer and more competent than participants low in CSE.&lt;ref name="Oosterwegel" /&gt; Cremer et al. also found that women expressed a higher level of CSE than men. These findings provide additional evidence that individuals high in CSE are more likely to engage in in-group distorting evaluations when there is a possible threat to their CSE.&lt;ref name="Cremer" /&gt; Applying the CSE scale in situations of a potential threat to the in-group (i.e., success or failure feedback), Crocker and Luhtanen found that, in contrast to people low in CSE, people high in CSE showed in-group favoritism, thereby indirectly enhancing the in-group. Individuals high in CSE will evaluate in-group members more positively than those low in CSE. The results concerning the in-group and outgroup evaluations seem to suggest that people with high CSE can be considered more confident about their esteemed social identity, making them search for more opportunities to enhance the collective self. As a result, those people will feel a greater need to evaluate their in-group members more positively (i.e., in-group favoritism) than people low in CSE. On the other hand, people low in CSE do not feel very confident about their social identity and, in order to avoid failure, they will consider out-group derogation as a more useful strategy to protect their social identity.

==Real-World Application==

Collective Self-Esteem can be seen in real-world applications through the use of [[Basking in reflected glory|BIRGing]] and CORFing.  Both different concepts but both effect and incorporate collective self-esteem into our everyday lives.

BIRGing (Basking In Reflected Glory) is when a person uses the association of another person’s success to boost his or her self-esteem or self-glory.  The act of BIRGing is often used to offset any threats made to a persons or a group’s self-esteem.  Sometimes, this act is actually made unknowingly and unintentional.  An example of BIRGing can be seen when your favorite sports team, say the University of Kansas men’s basketball team, has just won the national title.  You will notice when walking around campus or reading the local newspaper, you will be more likely to hear or read “We won!” or “We are the champs!” instead of "KU won!"

CORFing (Cutting Off Reflected Failure) can be seen in this same example, except when the team suffers a loss, the fans will change “we” to “they”.  For example, “They did not show enough heart” or “They really got outplayed today”. 

When someone uses BIRGing or CORFing, his or her collective self-esteem will be altered in either a positive or negative way and one must not only be careful on the frequency they are using these techniques, but also that these are often used unintentionally and can be taken out of context in many situations.  In an article titled “BIRGing and CORFing: From the Hardcourt to the Boardroom” by Kevin Meyer, the author provides an example of BIRGing and CORFing being used in the workplace for job security.  This can be seen when an employee aligns them self only with good projects or products and distances them self from poor outcomes and products. Employees must be careful when using these techniques often, because their coworkers may start to believe that that individual is only doing certain things to benefit him or herself and as Meyer states “throwing us under the bus” when hard times arise.&lt;ref name="Meyer" /&gt;  Meyer also states “An effective leader must be willing to weather the storm, sharing in the collective successes but also standing up for their team when things don’t go to plan. For most, BIRG and CORF can be more difficult to accomplish in the workplace as our affiliation with a particular team or project is often more obvious”.&lt;ref name="Meyer" /&gt;

===Social Identity Theory===
One related topic to collective self-esteem is [[social identity theory]].  This theory is when an individual’s [[self-concept]] is formed by a particular social group. When individuals categorize themselves in these social groups they create this self-concept and self-esteem.  [[Prototype]]s and [[stereotype]]s are involved in the social identity theory. This theory can predict inter-group relations and behaviors. [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner]] created this theory to explain inter-group behavior. Tajfel and Turner felt that people innately categorize themselves into in-groups(8). Social identity theory correlates with collective self-esteem because an individual bases their self-esteem or self-concept off of group membership. Social identity theory is also related to [[self-categorization theory]].  Both collective self-esteem and social identity theory use groups to identify themselves and acquire self-esteem.

===In-group bias===
Another related topic is in-group bias, also known as [[in-group favoritism]]. This is simply when an individual has a preference for their own in-group. In-group is superiority is stressed. There is believed superiority over the out-group. A bias is formed for the in-group and the out-group is excluded. In-group bias is also related to [[group conflict]]. Tajfel and Turner in, An Integrative Theory of Inter-group Conflict discuss this.&lt;ref name="Tajfel" /&gt; Individuals who have in-group bias tend to reject negative information about the in-group and only accept and stress positive information. People who have in-group bias are more likely to have positive collective self-esteem. This could also result in increased collective self-esteem as well. Social identity theory is a major theoretical approach for the phenomenon of in-group bias. To go along with in-group bias is out-group bias, also known as [[out-group homogeneity]]. This is when people in the in-group view themselves as more diverse than the out-group, saying that they are more alike than them. There has been research done regarding this phenomenon with race.  Dickter and Bartholow did a study on, in-group and out-group attention biases revealed by event related brain potentials.&lt;ref name="Dickter" /&gt;  When looking at faces of other races (out-group) the brain interpreted them as similar and could not identify them, whereas facial recognition with same race (in-group) was easier for the brain and these faces appeared to be more diverse.&lt;ref name="Dickter" /&gt; Other examples of this are with sorority and fraternities, as well as gender. Both in-group and out-group bias are used to protect the collective self-esteem. Jane Elliot at a school in Iowa did a famous experiment done with in-group out-group bias. Dividing children into groups based on their eye color observed the prejudice that can occur with in-group, out-group bias. The in-group in this situation was blue-eyed children who proceeded to criticize children who were in the out-group, or did not have blue eyes. The roles were reversed but had the same results.&lt;ref name="Whitbourne" /&gt;

'''Cultural bias''' is the phenomenon of interpreting and judging phenomena by standards inherent to one's own culture. The phenomenon is sometimes considered a problem central to social and human sciences, such as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[sociology]]. Some practitioners of the aforementioned fields have attempted to develop methods and theories to compensate for or eliminate cultural bias.

Cultural bias occurs when people of a culture make assumptions about conventions, including conventions of language, notation, proof and evidence. They are then accused of mistaking these assumptions for laws of logic or nature. Numerous such biases exist, concerning cultural norms for color, mate selection, concepts of justice, [[linguistics|linguistic]] and logical validity, the acceptability of evidence, and taboos.

==Cultural bias by discipline==
=== Psychology ===
Cultural bias has no a priori definition. Instead, its presence is inferred from differential performance of socioracial (e.g., [[Black people|Blacks]], [[Whites]]), ethnic (e.g., [[Latino]]s/Latinas, [[English people|Anglos]]), or national groups (e.g., U.S. [[Americans]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]]) on measures of psychological constructs such as cognitive abilities, knowledge or skills (CAKS), or symptoms of psychopathology (e.g., depression). Historically, the term grew out of efforts to explain between‐group score differences on CAKS tests primarily of [[African American]] and Latino/Latina American test takers relative to their [[White American]] counterparts and concerns that test scores should not be interpreted in the same manner across these groups. Although the concept of cultural bias in testing and assessment also pertains to score differences and potential misdiagnoses with respect to a broader range of psychological concepts, particularly in applied psychology and other social and behavioral sciences, this aspect of cultural bias has received less attention in the relevant literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0244|title=Cultural Bias in Psychological Testing|last=Helms|first=Janet|editor1-last=Weiner|editor1-first=I. B.|editor2-last=Craighead|editor2-first=W. E.|date=January 30, 2010|encyclopedia=The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology|publisher=Wiley Online Library, American Cancer Society|accessdate=April 19, 2018|doi=10.1002/9780470479216.corpsy0244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural bias in [[psychological testing]] refers to the standardized psychological tests that are conducted to determine the level of intelligence among the test-takers. Limitations of such verbal or non-verbal intelligence tests have been observed since their introduction. However, the limitations they put forth, due to their particular culture-friendliness, has been realized much later. Many tests have been objected to, as they produced poor results for the ethnic or racial minorities (students), as compared to the racial majorities. The problem lies not with the test-taker, but with the test itself. As discussed above, the learning environment, the questions posed or situations given in the test may be familiar and strange at the same time to students from different backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psychologenie.com/understanding-cultural-bias-with-examples.|title=Understanding the Phenomena of Cultural Bias With Examples|last=PsycholoGenie|first=|date=|website=psychologenie.com|access-date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Cultural bias in economic exchange is often overlooked. A study done at the [[Northwestern University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Guiso |first=Luigi |last2=Sapienza |first2=Paola |date=October 2008 |title=Cultural Bias in Economic Exchange? |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/sapienza/htm/cultural_biases.pdf |journal=Forthcoming: Quarterly Journal of Economics |access-date=April 22, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the cultural perception that two countries have of each other plays a large factor in the economic activity between them. This study suggests that low bilaterial trust between two countries will result in less trade, less [[portfolio investment]], and less [[direct investment]]. This effect is amplified for goods, as they are more trust intensive.

===Anthropology===
The concept of [[culture theory]] in anthropology explains that cultural bias is a critical piece of human group formation.

===Sociology===
It is thought that societies with conflicting beliefs will more likely have cultural bias as it is dependent on the group's standing in society, where the [[social construction]]s affect how a problem is produced. One example of cultural bias within the context of sociology can be seen in a study done at the [[University of California]] by Jane R. Mercer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mercer|first1=Jane R. |title=Test "validity", "bias", and "fairness": An analysis from the perspective of the sociology of knowledge|journal=Interchange|date=March 1978|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–16|doi=10.1007/BF01807733|url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01807733.pdf|accessdate=April 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of how test "validity", "bias", and "fairness" in different cultural belief systems affect one's future in a [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] society. A definition of the cultural bias was given as "the extent that the test contains cultural content that is generally peculiar to the members of one group but not to the members of another group", which leads to a belief that "the internal structure of the test will differ for different cultural groups". In addition, the different types of errors made on culture-biased tests are dependent on different cultural groups. This idea progressed to the conclusion that a non-cultural-test will represent the ability of a population as intended and will not reflect the abilities of a group that is not represented.

===History===
Cultural bias may also arise in historical scholarship, when the standards, assumptions and conventions of the historian's own era are [[anachronism|anachronistically]] used to report and assess events of the past. This tendency is sometimes known as [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentism]], and is regarded by many historians as a fault to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David H. |last=Fischer |authorlink=David Hackett Fischer |title=Historians' Fallacies: toward a logic of historical thought |location=New York |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |year=1970 |isbn=0061315451 |pages=137–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Marwick]] has argued that "a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know" is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that "anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Arthur |last=Marwick |authorlink=Arthur Marwick |title=The New Nature of History: knowledge, evidence, language |place=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave |year=2001 |isbn=0-333-96447-0 |page=63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Darwin by Julia Margaret Cameron 2.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1868]]

'''Darwinism''' is a [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[Biology|biological]] [[evolution]] developed by the English naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882) and others, stating that all [[species]] of organisms arise and develop through the [[natural selection]] of small, inherited variations that increase the individual's ability to compete, survive, and [[reproduction|reproduce]]. Also called '''Darwinian theory''', it originally included the broad concepts of [[transmutation of species]] or of evolution which gained general scientific acceptance after Darwin published ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, including concepts which predated Darwin's theories. It subsequently referred to the specific concepts of natural selection, the [[Weismann barrier]], or the [[central dogma of molecular biology]].&lt;ref name="antidarwinian"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/anti-darwin.html |title=So You Want to be an Anti-Darwinian: Varieties of Opposition to Darwinism |last=Wilkins |first=John |date=21 December 1998 |website=[[TalkOrigins Archive]] |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the term usually refers strictly to biological evolution, [[creationism|creationists]] have appropriated it to refer to the [[abiogenesis|origin of life]], and it has even been applied to concepts of [[Physical cosmology|cosmic evolution]], both of which have no connection to Darwin's work. It is therefore considered the belief and acceptance of Darwin's and of his predecessors' work—in place of other theories, including [[Teleological argument|divine design]] and [[Panspermia|extraterrestrial origins]].&lt;ref name="EOflunks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expelledexposed.drupalgardens.com/contest/on-what-evolution-explains |title=…on what evolution explains |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Expelled Exposed |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |location=Oakland, CA |accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GalacticDarwinism"&gt;{{cite press release |last1=Le Fèvre |first1=Olivier |last2=Marinoni |first2=Christian |date=6 December 2006 |title=Do Galaxies Follow Darwinian Evolution? |url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0645/ |location=Marseille, France |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]] |id=eso0645 |accessdate=2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] coined the term ''Darwinism'' in April 1860.&lt;ref name="westminster"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huxley |first=T.H. |authorlink=Thomas Henry Huxley |date=April 1860 |title=ART.

Many of the proponents of Darwinism at that time, including Huxley, had reservations about the significance of natural selection, and Darwin himself gave credence to what was later called [[Lamarckism]]. The strict [[neo-Darwinism]] of German evolutionary biologist [[August Weismann]] gained few supporters in the late 19th century. During the approximate period of the 1880s to about 1920, sometimes called "[[the eclipse of Darwinism]]", scientists proposed various [[Alternatives to Darwinism|alternative evolutionary mechanisms]] which eventually proved untenable.  The development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] in the early 20th century, incorporating natural selection with [[population genetics]] and [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]], revived Darwinism in an updated form.&lt;ref name="b222"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=179, 222–225, 338–339, 347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term ''Darwinism'' has remained in use amongst the public when referring to modern evolutionary theory, it has increasingly been argued by science writers such as [[Olivia Judson]] and [[Eugenie Scott]] that it is an inappropriate term for modern evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="Scott Branch 09"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scott |first1=Eugenie C. |authorlink1=Eugenie Scott |last2=Branch |first2=Glenn |authorlink2=Glenn Branch |date=16 January 2009 |title=Don't Call it 'Darwinism' |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |location=New York |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=90–94 |doi=10.1007/s12052-008-0111-2 |issn=1936-6426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Judson |first=Olivia |authorlink=Olivia Judson |date=15 July 2008 |title=Let's Get Rid of Darwinism |url=http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/lets-get-rid-of-darwinism/ |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Darwin was unfamiliar with the work of the [[Moravia]]n scientist and [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[friar]] [[Gregor Mendel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sclater|first=Andrew|date=June 2006|title=The extent of Charles Darwin's knowledge of Mendel|journal=[[Journal of Biosciences]]|location=Bangalore, India|publisher=[[Indian Academy of Sciences]] / Springer India|volume=31|issue=2|pages=191–193|doi=10.1007/BF02703910|issn=0250-5991|pmid=16809850}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2009-01-03--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result had only a vague and inaccurate understanding of [[heredity]]. He naturally had no inkling of later theoretical  developments and, like Mendel himself, knew nothing of [[genetic drift]], for example.&lt;ref name="GeneticDrift"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/genetic-drift.html |title=Random Genetic Drift |last=Moran |first=Laurence |date=22 January 1993 |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/darwinism.html |title=What is Darwinism? |last=Hanes |first=Joel |website=TalkOrigins Archive |publisher=The TalkOrigins Foundation, Inc. |location=Houston, TX |accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, creationists often use the term "Darwinism" as a [[pejorative]] term in reference to beliefs such as [[Metaphysical naturalism|scientific materialism]], but in the United Kingdom the term has no negative connotations, being freely used as a shorthand for the body of theory dealing with evolution, and in particular, with evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref name="Scott Branch 09" /&gt;

==Conceptions of Darwinism==
[[File:Editorial cartoon depicting Charles Darwin as an ape (1871).jpg|thumb|As [[evolution]] became widely accepted in the 1870s, [[Caricatures of Charles Darwin and his evolutionary theory in 19th-century England|caricatures of Charles Darwin]] with the body of an ape or monkey symbolised evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=376–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

While the term ''Darwinism'' had been used previously to refer to the work of [[Erasmus Darwin]] in the late 18th century, the term as understood today was introduced when Charles Darwin's 1859 book ''On the Origin of Species'' was reviewed by Thomas Henry Huxley in the April 1860 issue of the ''[[Westminster Review]]''.&lt;ref name="urlThe Huxley File § 4 Darwins Bulldog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/guide4.html |title=Darwin's Bulldog |last1=Blinderman |first1=Charles |last2=Joyce |first2=David |website=The Huxley File |publisher=[[Clark University]] |location=Worcester, MA |accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having hailed the book as "a veritable [[Joseph Whitworth#Whitworth rifle|Whitworth gun]] in the armoury of liberalism" promoting [[naturalism (philosophy)|scientific naturalism]] over [[theology]], and praising the usefulness of Darwin's ideas while expressing professional reservations about Darwin's [[gradualism]] and doubting if it could be proved that natural selection could form new species,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|2002|pp=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley compared Darwin's achievement to that of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in explaining planetary motion:
{{quotation|What if the orbit of Darwinism should be a little too circular? What if species should offer residual phenomena, here and there, not explicable by natural selection? Twenty years hence naturalists may be in a position to say whether this is, or is not, the case; but in either event they will owe the author of "The Origin of Species" an immense debt of gratitude.... And viewed as a whole, we do not believe that, since the publication of Von Baer's "Researches on Development," thirty years ago, any work has appeared calculated to exert so large an influence, not only on the future of Biology, but in extending the domination of Science over regions of thought into which she has, as yet, hardly penetrated.&lt;ref name="westminster" /&gt;}}

These are the basic tenets of evolution by natural selection as defined by Darwin:

# More individuals are produced each generation that can survive.
# Phenotypic variation exists among individuals and the variation is heritable.
# Those individuals with heritable traits better suited to the environment will survive.
# When reproductive isolation occurs new species will form.

Another important evolutionary theorist of the same period was the Russian geographer and prominent anarchist [[Peter Kropotkin]] who, in his book ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'' (1902), advocated a conception of Darwinism counter to that of Huxley. His conception was centred around what he saw as the widespread use of co-operation as a survival mechanism in human societies and animals. He used biological and [[Sociology|sociological]] arguments in an attempt to show that the main factor in facilitating evolution is cooperation between individuals in free-associated societies and groups. This was in order to counteract the conception of fierce [[Competition (biology)|competition]] as the core of evolution, which provided a [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for the dominant political, economic and social theories of the time; and the prevalent interpretations of Darwinism, such as those by Huxley, who is targeted as an opponent by Kropotkin. Kropotkin's conception of Darwinism could be summed up by the following quote:

{{quotation|In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood, of course, in its wide Darwinian sense—not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress. The mutual protection which is obtained in this case, the possibility of attaining old age and of accumulating experience, the higher intellectual development, and the further growth of sociable habits, secure the maintenance of the species, its extension, and its further progressive evolution. The unsociable species, on the contrary, are doomed to decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kropotkin|1902|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Peter Kropotkin|Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution (1902), Conclusion}}

==19th-century usage==
"Darwinism" soon came to stand for an entire range of evolutionary (and often revolutionary) philosophies about both biology and society. One of the more prominent approaches, summed in the 1864 phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]" by Herbert Spencer, later became emblematic of Darwinism even though Spencer's own understanding of evolution (as expressed in 1857) was more similar to that of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] than to that of Darwin, and predated the [[publication of Darwin's theory]] in 1859. What is now called "[[Social Darwinism]]" was, in its day, synonymous with "Darwinism"—the application of Darwinian principles of "struggle" to society, usually in support of anti-[[philanthropy|philanthropic]] political agenda. Another interpretation, one notably favoured by Darwin's half-cousin [[Francis Galton]], was that "Darwinism" implied that because natural selection was apparently no longer working on "civilized" people, it was possible for "inferior" strains of people (who would normally be filtered out of the [[gene pool]]) to overwhelm the "superior" strains, and voluntary corrective measures would be desirable—the foundation of [[eugenics]].

{{anchor|Darwinismus}}
In Darwin's day there was no rigid definition of the term "Darwinism", and it was used by opponents and proponents of Darwin's biological theory alike to mean whatever they wanted it to in a larger context. The ideas had international influence, and [[Ernst Haeckel]] developed what was known as ''Darwinismus'' in Germany, although, like Spencer's "evolution", Haeckel's "Darwinism" had only a rough resemblance to the theory of Charles Darwin, and was not centered on natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt S. (2009). ''Haeckel: A German Darwinian?'' Comptes Rendus Biologies: 332: 110-118.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] went on a lecture tour across the United States, starting in New York and going via Boston, Washington, Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska to California, lecturing on what he called "Darwinism" without any problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Evolution and Wonder: Understanding Charles Darwin |url=http://www.onbeing.org/program/evolution-and-wonder-understanding-charles-darwin/transcript/899#main_content |accessdate=2015-11-16 |series=[[On Being|Speaking of Faith with Krista Tippett]] |first1=Krista (host) |last1=Tippett |authorlink1=Krista Tippett |first2=James |last2=Moore |authorlink2=James Moore (biographer) |network=[[NPR]] |type=Transcript |airdate=5 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Darwinism (book)|Darwinism]]'' (1889), Wallace had used the term ''pure-Darwinism'' which proposed a "greater efficacy" for [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Alfred Russel. (1889). [https://archive.org/stream/darwinismexposit00walluoft#page/n11/mode/2up ''Darwinism: An Exposition of the Theory of Natural Selection, with Some of Its Applications''].

OUP USA. p. 203. {{ISBN|978-0195112290}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Romanes]] dubbed this view as "Wallaceism", noting that in contrast to Darwin, this position was advocating a "pure theory of natural selection to the exclusion of any supplementary theory."&lt;ref&gt;Romanes, John George. (1906). [https://archive.org/stream/darwinafterdarwi02romabost#page/12/mode/2up "Darwin and After Darwin: An Exposition of the Darwinian Theory and a Discussion of Post-Darwinian Questions"].

Harvard University Press. p. 274. {{ISBN|978-0674729698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking influence from Darwin, Romanes was a proponent of both natural selection and the [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]]. The latter was denied by Wallace who was a strict selectionist.&lt;ref&gt;Bolles, R. C; Beecher, M. D. (1987). ''Evolution and Learning''. Psychology Press. p. 45. {{ISBN|978-0898595420}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanes' definition of Darwinism conformed directly with Darwin's views and was contrasted with Wallace's definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Elsdon-Baker, F. (2008). ''Spirited dispute: the secret split between Wallace and Romanes''. Endeavour 32(2): 75-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The term ''Darwinism'' is often used in the United States by promoters of [[creationism]], notably by leading members of the [[intelligent design movement]], as an epithet to attack evolution as though it were an ideology (an "ism") of [[philosophical naturalism]], or [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="genie"&gt;[[#Petto &amp; Godfrey 2007|Scott 2007]], "Creation Science Lite: 'Intelligent Design' as the New Anti-Evolutionism," p. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100603214827/http://biology.ucf.edu/~clp/Courses/seminar/papers/07-Scott-scientists_confront-cs_lite.pdf 72]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] law professor and author [[Phillip E. Johnson]] makes this accusation of atheism with reference to [[Charles Hodge#Darwinism|Charles Hodge]]'s book ''What Is Darwinism?'' (1874).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arn.org/docs/johnson/wid.htm |title=What is Darwinism? |last=Johnson |first=Phillip E. |authorlink=Phillip E. Johnson |date=31 August 1996 |website=[[Access Research Network]] |location=Colorado Springs, CO |accessdate=2007-01-04}} "This paper was originally delivered as a lecture at a symposium at Hillsdale College, in November 1992. Papers from the Symposium were published in the collection ''Man and Creation: Perspectives on Science and Theology'' (Bauman ed. 1993), by Hillsdale College Press, Hillsdale MI 49242."&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike Johnson, Hodge confined the term to exclude those like American botanist [[Asa Gray]] who combined Christian faith with support for Darwin's natural selection theory, before answering the question posed in the book's title by concluding: "It is Atheism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theropps.com/papers/Winter1997/CharlesHodge.htm |title=Charles Hodge and His Objection to Darwinism: The Exclusion of Intelligent Design |last=Ropp |first=Matthew |website=theRopps.com |location=Chesterbrook, PA |accessdate=2007-01-04}} Paper for CH506: American Church History, Dr. Nathan Feldmeth, Winter Quarter 1997, "written while a student in the School of World Mission at [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], Pasadena, California."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodge|1874}}&lt;/ref&gt; Creationists use the term ''Darwinism'', often pejoratively, to imply that the theory has been held as true only by Darwin and a core group of his followers, whom they cast as [[dogma]]tic and inflexible in their belief.&lt;ref name=morrissullivan&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Morris |date=Spring 2005 |title=From the Beagle to the School Board: God Goes Back to School |url=http://www.impactpress.com/articles/spring05/sullivanspring05.html |journal=[[Impact Press]] |location=Orlando, FL |publisher=Loudmouth Productions |issue=56 |accessdate=2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 documentary film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'', which promotes [[intelligent design]] (ID), American writer and actor [[Ben Stein]] refers to scientists as Darwinists. Reviewing the film for ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[John Rennie (editor)|John Rennie]] says "The term is a curious throwback, because in modern biology almost no one relies solely on Darwin's original ideas... Yet the choice of terminology isn't random: Ben Stein wants you to stop thinking of evolution as an actual science supported by verifiable facts and logical arguments and to start thinking of it as a dogmatic, atheistic ideology akin to [[Marxism]]." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rennie |first=John  |authorlink=John Rennie (editor) |date=9 April 2008 |title=Ben Stein's ''Expelled'': No Integrity Displayed |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ben-steins-expelled-review-john-rennie/ |journal=[[Scientific American]] |location=Stuttgart |publisher=[[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group]] |issn=0036-8733 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''Darwinism'' is also used neutrally within the scientific community to distinguish the modern evolutionary synthesis, sometimes called "neo-Darwinism", from those first proposed by Darwin. ''Darwinism'' also is used neutrally by historians to differentiate his theory from other evolutionary theories current around the same period. For example, ''Darwinism'' may be used to refer to Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection, in comparison to more recent mechanisms such as genetic drift and [[gene flow]]. It may also refer specifically to the role of Charles Darwin as opposed to others in the [[history of evolutionary thought]]—particularly contrasting Darwin's results with those of earlier theories such as Lamarckism or later ones such as the modern evolutionary synthesis.

In political discussions in the United States, the term is mostly used by its enemies. "It's a rhetorical device to make evolution seem like a kind of faith, like '[[Maoism]],'" says [[Harvard University]] biologist [[E. O. Wilson]]. He adds, "Scientists don't call it 'Darwinism'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adler |first=Jerry |date=28 November 2005 |title=Charles Darwin: Evolution of a Scientist |url=http://www.newsweek.com/evolution-scientist-113733 |work=[[Newsweek]] |location=New York |publisher=Newsweek LLC |volume=146 |issue=22 |pages=50–58 |issn=0028-9604 |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom the term often retains its positive sense as a reference to natural selection, and for example British [[Ethology|ethologist]] and evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] wrote in his collection of essays ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'', published in 2003,  that as a scientist he is a Darwinist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Science-Religion/2003/12/Religion-For-Dummies.aspx |title=Religion: For Dummies |last=Sheahen |first=Laura |website=[[Beliefnet]] |publisher=BN Media, LLC |location=Norfolk, VA |accessdate=2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1995 book ''[[Darwinian Fairytales]]'', Australian philosopher [[David Stove]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stove|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the term "Darwinism" in a different sense than the above examples. Describing himself as non-religious and as accepting the concept of natural selection as a well-established fact, Stove nonetheless attacked what he described as flawed concepts proposed by some "Ultra-Darwinists." Stove alleged that by using weak or false ''[[ad hoc]]'' reasoning, these Ultra-Darwinists used evolutionary concepts to offer explanations that were not valid (e.g., Stove suggested that [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] explanation of [[altruism]] as an evolutionary feature was presented in such a way that the argument was effectively immune to any criticism). Philosopher [[Simon Blackburn]] wrote a rejoinder to Stove,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blackburn |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Blackburn |date=October 1996 |title=I Rather Think I Am a Darwinian |journal=[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]] |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] on behalf of [[Royal Institute of Philosophy]] |volume=71 |number=278 |pages=605–616 |issn=0031-8191 |jstor=3751128 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100053523}}&lt;/ref&gt; though a subsequent essay by Stove's protegee [[James Franklin (philosopher)|James Franklin]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Franklin |first=James |authorlink=James Franklin (philosopher) |date=January 1997 |title=Stove's Anti-Darwinism |url=http://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/stovesantidarwinism.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Philosophy |location=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press on behalf of Royal Institute of Philosophy |volume=72 |number=279 |pages=133–136 |issn=0031-8191 |jstor=3751309 |doi=10.1017/s0031819100056692}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that Blackburn's response actually "confirms Stove's central thesis that Darwinism can 'explain' anything."

In [[dimensional analysis]], a '''dimensionless quantity''' is a [[quantity]] to which no [[dimensional analysis|physical dimension]] is assigned. It is also known as a '''bare number''' or '''pure number''' or a '''quantity of dimension one'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/sites/JCGM/VIM/JCGM_200e_FILES/MAIN_JCGM_200e/01_e.html#L_1_8|title='''1.8''' (1.6) '''quantity of dimension one''' dimensionless quantity|work=International vocabulary of metrology — Basic and general concepts and associated terms (VIM)|publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]|year=2008|accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the corresponding unit of measurement in the [[International System of Units|SI]] is '''one''' (or '''1''') unit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf|title=The International System of Units (SI)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[International_Bureau_of_Weights_and_Measures|Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohr|first=Peter J.|last2=Phillips|first2=William D.|date=2015-06-01|title=Dimensionless units in the SI|url=https://www.nist.gov/publications/dimensionless-units-si|journal=Metrologia|language=en|volume=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not explicitly shown. Dimensionless quantities are widely used in many fields, such as [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], and [[economics]]. Examples of quantities to which dimensions are regularly assigned are [[length]], [[time]], and [[speed]], which are measured in dimensional units, such as [[metre]], [[second]] and [[metre per second]]. This is considered to aid intuitive understanding. However, especially in mathematical physics, it is often more convenient to drop the assignment of explicit dimensions and express the quantities without dimensions, e.g., addressing the speed of light simply by the dimensionless number {{math|1}}.

== History ==
{{See also|Dimensional analysis#History}}
Quantities having dimension 1, ''dimensionless quantities'', regularly occur in sciences, and are formally treated within the field of [[dimensional analysis]]. In the nineteenth century, French mathematician [[Joseph Fourier]] and Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] led significant developments in the modern concepts of [[dimension]] and [[Unit (measurement)|unit]].  Later work by British physicists [[Osborne Reynolds]] and [[Lord Rayleigh]] contributed to the understanding of dimensionless numbers in physics.  Building on Rayleigh's method of dimensional analysis, [[Edgar Buckingham]] proved the [[Buckingham π theorem|{{pi}} theorem]] (independent of French mathematician [[Joseph Bertrand]]'s previous work) to formalize the nature of these quantities.  

Numerous dimensionless numbers, mostly ratios, were coined in the early 1900s,  particularly in the areas of [[fluid mechanics]] and [[heat transfer]]. Measuring ''ratios'' in the (derived) unit ''dB'' ([[decibel]]) finds widespread use nowadays.  

In the early 2000s, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] discussed naming the unit of 1 as the "[[Uno (unit)|uno]]", but the idea of just introducing a new SI-name for 1 was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU15.pdf |title=BIPM Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), 15th Meeting |date=17–18 April 2003 |accessdate=2010-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130201238/http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU15.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |title=BIPM Consultative Committee for Units (CCU), 16th Meeting |accessdate=2010-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130200835/http://www.bipm.fr/utils/common/pdf/CCU16.pdf |archivedate=2006-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dybkaer, René |title=An ontology on property for physical, chemical, and biological systems |journal=APMIS Suppl. |issue=117 |pages=1–210 |year=2004 |pmid=15588029 |url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2005/2703/bw1_dybkaer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pure numbers ==
All '''[[number|pure numbers]]''' are dimensionless quantities, for example [[1 (number)|1]], [[imaginary unit|{{mvar|i}}]], [[pi|{{pi}}]], [[Euler's number|{{mvar|e}}]], and [[Golden ratio|{{mvar|φ}}]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ym5u5IlYWcg|title=Pure Numbers and Significant Digits|first=|last=Khan Academy|date=21 April 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units of number such as the [[dozen]], [[Gross (unit)|gross]], [[googol]], and [[Avogadro's number]] may also be considered dimensionless.

== Ratios, proportions, and angles ==
Dimensionless quantities are often obtained as [[ratio]]s of [[quantity|quantities]] that are not dimensionless, but whose dimensions cancel out in the mathematical operation.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/6.055/old/S2008/notes/apr02a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include calculating [[slope]]s or [[Conversion of units|unit conversion factors]]. A more complex example of such a ratio is [[engineering strain]], a measure of physical deformation defined as a change in length divided by the initial length. Since both quantities have the dimension ''length'', their ratio is dimensionless. Another set of examples is [[mass fraction (chemistry)|mass fraction]]s or [[mole fraction]]s often written using [[parts-per notation]] such as ppm (=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;), ppb (=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;), and ppt (=&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;), or more confusingly as ratios of two identical units ([[kilogram|kg]]/kg or [[mole (unit)|mol]]/mol). For example, [[alcohol by volume]], which characterizes the concentration of [[ethanol]] in an [[alcoholic beverage]], could be written as mL / 100 mL.

Other common proportions are percentages [[%]]&amp;nbsp;(=&amp;nbsp;0.01), &amp;nbsp;[[per mil|‰]]&amp;nbsp;(=&amp;nbsp;0.001) and angle units such as [[radians]], [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (°=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|{{pi}}|180}}) and  [[gradian|grads]](=&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|{{pi}}|200}}). In [[statistics]] the [[coefficient of variation]] is the ratio of the [[standard deviation]] to the [[average|mean]] and is used to measure the [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] in the [[statistical data|data]].

== Buckingham {{pi}} theorem ==
{{main|Buckingham π theorem}}
The Buckingham {{pi}} theorem indicates that validity of the laws of physics does not depend on a specific unit system. A statement of this theorem is that any physical law can be expressed as an [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] involving only dimensionless combinations (ratios or products) of the variables linked by the law (e. g., pressure and volume are linked by [[Boyle's Law]] – they are inversely proportional). If the dimensionless combinations' values changed with the systems of units, then the equation would not be an identity, and Buckingham's theorem would not hold.

Another consequence of the theorem is that the [[Function (mathematics)|functional]] dependence between a certain number (say, ''n'') of [[variable (mathematics)|variables]] can be reduced by the number (say, ''k'') of [[independent variable|independent]] [[dimension]]s occurring in those variables to give a set of ''p'' = ''n'' − ''k'' independent, dimensionless [[quantity|quantities]]. For the purposes of the experimenter, different systems that share the same description by dimensionless [[quantity]] are equivalent.

=== Example ===
To demonstrate the application of the {{pi}} theorem, consider the [[electric power|power]] consumption of a [[stirrer]] with a given shape.
The power, ''P'', in dimensions [M · L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;], is a function of the [[density]], ''ρ'' [M/L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;], and the [[viscosity]] of the fluid to be stirred, ''μ'' [M/(L · T)], as well as the size of the stirrer given by its [[diameter]], ''D'' [L], and the [[Angular velocity|angular speed]] of the stirrer, ''n'' [1/T]. Therefore, we have a total of ''n'' = 5 variables representing our example.  Those ''n'' = 5 variables are built up from ''k'' = 3 fundamental dimensions, the length: L ([[SI]] units: [[meters|m]]), time: T ([[second|s]]), and mass: M ([[kilograms|kg]]).

According to the {{pi}}-theorem, the ''n'' = 5 variables can be reduced by the ''k'' = 3 dimensions to form ''p'' = ''n'' − ''k'' = 5 − 3 = 2 independent dimensionless numbers. These quantities are &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Re} = {\frac{\rho n D^2}{\mu}}&lt;/math&gt;, commonly named the [[Reynolds number]] which describes the fluid flow regime, and &lt;math&gt;N_\mathrm{p} = \frac{P}{\rho n^3 D^5}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[power number]], which is the dimensionless description of the stirrer.

== Dimensionless physical constants ==
{{main|Dimensionless physical constant}}
Certain universal dimensioned physical constants, such as the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, the [[universal gravitational constant]], [[Planck's constant]], [[Coulomb's constant]], and [[Boltzmann's constant]] can be normalized to 1 if appropriate units for [[time]], [[length]], [[mass]], [[electric charge|charge]], and [[temperature]] are chosen. The resulting [[system of units]] is known as the [[natural units]], specifically regarding these five constants, [[Planck units]]. However, not all [[physical constant]]s can be normalized in this fashion. For example, the values of the following constants are independent of the system of units, cannot be defined, and can only be determined experimentally:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html |title=How Many Fundamental Constants Are There? |last1=Baez |first1=John |date=April 22, 2011 |website= |publisher= |access-date=October 7, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''α'' ≈ 1/137, the [[fine structure constant]], which characterizes the magnitude of the [[electromagnetic interaction]] between electrons.
* ''β'' (or ''μ'') ≈ 1836, the [[proton-to-electron mass ratio]]. This ratio is the [[rest mass]] of the [[proton]] divided by that of the [[electron]]. An analogous ratio can be defined for any [[elementary particle]];
* ''α''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 1, a coupling constant characterizing the [[strong force|strong nuclear force]];
* ''α''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 1.75 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−45&lt;/sup&gt;, the [[gravitational coupling constant]] which is the square of the ratio of the mass of the electron to the [[Planck mass]], which characterizes the magnitude of the [[gravitation|gravitational interaction]] between electrons.  It is because, fundamentally, this number is so small that it is meaningful to say "Gravity is an extremely weak fundamental force in comparison to either the electromagnetic force or the strong nuclear force."

== Other quantities produced by nondimensionalization ==
{{Main|List of dimensionless quantities}}

Physics often uses dimensionless [[quantity|quantities]] to simplify the characterization of systems with multiple interacting physical phenomena.  These may be found by applying the [[Buckingham π theorem|Buckingham {{pi}} theorem]] or otherwise may emerge from making [[partial differential equations]] unitless by the process of [[nondimensionalization]]. Engineering, economics, and other fields often extend these ideas in [[design]] and analysis of the relevant systems.

=== Physics and engineering ===
* [[Fresnel number]] – wavenumber over distance
* [[Mach number]] – ratio of the speed of an object or flow relative to the speed of sound in the fluid.
{{further|Dimensionless numbers in fluid mechanics}}
* [[Beta (plasma physics)]] – ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, used in magnetospheric physics as well as fusion plasma physics.
* [[Damköhler numbers]] (Da) – used in chemical engineering to relate the chemical reaction timescale (reaction rate) to the transport phenomena rate occurring in a system.
* [[Thiele modulus]] – describes the relationship between diffusion and reaction rate in porous catalyst pellets with no mass transfer limitations.
* [[Numerical aperture]] – characterizes the range of angles over which the system can accept or emit light.
* [[Sherwood number]] – (also called the mass transfer Nusselt number) is a dimensionless number used in mass-transfer operation. It represents the ratio of the convective mass transfer to the rate of diffusive mass transport.
* [[Schmidt number]] – defined as the ratio of momentum diffusivity (kinematic viscosity) and mass diffusivity, and is used to characterize fluid flows in which there are simultaneous momentum and mass diffusion convection processes.
* [[Reynolds number]] is commonly used in fluid mechanics to characterize flow, incorporating both properties of the fluid and the flow. It is interpreted as the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces and can indicate flow regime as well as correlate to frictional heating in application to flow in pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipp.mpg.de/~dpc/nrl/ |title=NRL Plasma Formulary: Dimensionless Numbers of Fluid Mechanics |last1=Huba |first1=J. D. |date=2007 |website= |publisher=Naval Research Laboratory |access-date=October 7, 2015 |quote=p. 23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemistry ===
* [[Relative density]] – density relative to [[water]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8049">'''Ecologically sustainable development''' is the environmental component of [[sustainable development]]. It can be achieved partially through the use of the [[precautionary principle]]; if there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to prevent [[environmental degradation]].
Also important is the principle of [[intergenerational equity]]; the present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the benefit of future generations. In order for this movement to flourish, environmental factors should be more heavily weighed in the valuation of assets and services to provide more incentive for the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity.

==Political considerations==
Effective political support is necessary for ecologically sustainable development. The mobilization of governments can be translated into action plans that are crucial to [[Sustainable development#Politics|sustainable development]]. Development efforts can be influenced by patterns of family arrangements, work attitudes, [[Morality|social morality]]—particularly interpersonal responsibilities, hierarchy of authority, quality of scientific education and implementation, and degree of domestic stability—especially, freedom from [[social conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel.

Canada has taken an evidence based approach to sustainability development by using Environmental [[Sustainability measurement|Sustainability Indicators]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ec.gc.ca/indicateurs-indicators/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=47F48106-1 |title=Environmental Sustainability Indicators |author=Government of Canada|accessdate=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as guiding tool for policy development. At the municipal level, many cities also use evidence based indicators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.surrey.ca/community/3568.aspx |title=Sustainability Charter|author=City of Surrey|accessdate=7 May 2016}}

==Forums for ecologically sustainable development==
The World Conservation Strategy was published in 1980, becoming one of the most encouraging developments that uses a goal-oriented programme for political change concerning ecological sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert P.|title=How to Save the World: Strategy for World Conservation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwghAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP1|year=1980|publisher=Barnes and Noble Books|isbn=978-0-389-20011-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The publication marked a fundamental policy shift for the global [[conservation movement]]. The traditional focus became cure rather than [[Prevention Science|Prevention]], confirming the growing trend on the assimilation of preservation and development aims that are key to an ecologically sustainable society. Specifically, the concentration on [[wildlife conservation]] drifted into a concern for wider strains degrading the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCormick|first=John|title=The Origins of the World Conservation Strategy|journal=Environmental Review|year=1986|volume=10|issue=3|pages=177–187|jstor=3984544}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It promotes the principles of sustainable development and addresses the environmental concerns introduced by [[economic development]] decisions with a format that targets a wide audience. There are three chief conservation objectives:
#Maintaining essential [[biogeochemical cycle]]s and life-support systems
#Preserving [[genetic diversity]]
#Establishing a sustainable use of [[species]] and [[ecosystem]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|title=Ecologically Sustainable Development: Integrating Economics, Ecology, and Law|journal=Willamette Law Review|year=1995|volume=31|issue=2|pages=261–306|url=https://litigation-essentials.lexisnexis.com/webcd/app?action=DocumentDisplay&amp;crawlid=1&amp;doctype=cite&amp;docid=31+Willamette+L.+Rev.+261&amp;srctype=smi&amp;srcid=3B15&amp;key=118207f62b4908b2ee0eb7a21f829a93|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other efforts such as the World Campaign for the Biosphere present environmental obstacles constantly before governmental and scientific authorities. Nicholas Polunin, former president of the Foundation for Environmental Conservation, believed the starting point for the World Campaign effort occurred in 1966 at an [[UNESCO]] conference in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polunin|first=Nicholas|title=Our Global Environment and the World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=Environmental Conservation|year=1982|volume=9|issue=02|pages=115|doi=10.1017/S0376892900020002}}&lt;!--|accessdate=4 April 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The conference examined conditions that hinder ecologically sustainable development such as rapid [[population growth]], proliferation of [[nuclear weapon]]s, and depletion of [[natural resource]]s. Similarly, the [[The Global 2000 Report to the President|Global 2000 Report to the President]], presents environmental prospective conditions that are likely to worsen if public policies, institutions, and rates of technologic advancement do not change. Findings of this type prompted [[environmentalist]]s and the Foundation for Environmental Conservation to initiate the World Campaign project and have included the following suggestions:
:*Publication and broadcast of [[environmental issue]]s
:*Use of traditional [[Media (communication)|communication mediums]] such as posters and automobile stickers
:*Distribution of increasing basic and applied environmental research results
:*Information about [[family planning]] and the necessity to control population growth
:*Designating more area as [[national park]]s or [[wilderness area]]s, including the ocean
:*Organization of local, state, national, and international conferences to discuss environmental issues
:*Encouraging sustainable uses of our natural resources
:*Establishment of [[common law]]s for the Earth and mankind
:*Obtaining support form [[nongovernmental organization]]s and [[institution]]s for the World Campaign
:*Attaining recognition such as "Guardians of the Biosphere Awards," for persons and/or groups that demonstrate actions to preserve the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barman|first=Charles R.|title=The World Campaign for the Biosphere|journal=The American Biology Teacher|volume=46|issue=5|pages=269–271|doi=10.2307/4447840|jstor=4447840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy-efficient landscaping''' is a type of [[Landscape architecture|landscaping]] designed for the purpose of [[energy conservation|conserving energy]]. There is a distinction between the embedded energy of materials and constructing the landscape, and the energy consumed by the maintenance and operations of a landscape.

Design techniques include:
* Planting [[trees]] for the purpose of providing [[shade (shadow)|shade]], which reduces cooling costs.
* Planting or building [[windbreak]]s to slow winds near buildings, which reduces heat loss.
* Wall sheltering, where [[shrubbery]] or vines are used to create a windbreak directly against a wall.
* [[Earth sheltering]] and positioning buildings to take advantage of natural landforms as windbreaks.
* [[Green roof]]s that cool buildings with extra [[thermal mass]] and [[evapotranspiration]].
* Reducing the [[heat island effect]] with pervious paving, high [[albedo]] paving, shade, and minimizing paved areas.
* Site lighting with full cut off fixtures, light level sensors, and high efficiency fixtures

Energy-efficient landscaping techniques include using local materials, on-site composting and chipping to reduce [[greenwaste]] [[hauling]], [[hand tool]]s instead of gasoline-powered, and also may involve using [[drought-resistant]] plantings in [[arid]] areas, [[buy local|buying stock from local growers]] to avoid energy in [[transportation]], and similar techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3386">In algebra, a '''generic matrix ring''' is a sort of a universal [[matrix ring]].

== Definition ==
We denote by &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; a generic matrix ring of size ''n'' with variables &lt;math&gt;X_1, \dots X_m&lt;/math&gt;. It is characterized by the universal property: given a commutative ring ''R'' and ''n''-by-''n'' matrices &lt;math&gt;A_1, \dots, A_m&lt;/math&gt; over ''R'', any mapping &lt;math&gt;X_i \mapsto A_i&lt;/math&gt; extends to the [[ring homomorphism]] (called evaluation) &lt;math&gt;F_n \to M_n(R)&lt;/math&gt;.

Explicitly, given a field ''k'', it is the subalgebra &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; of the matrix ring &lt;math&gt;M_n(k[(X_l)_{ij}|1 \le l \le m, 1 \le i, j \le n])&lt;/math&gt; generated by ''n''-by-''n'' matrices &lt;math&gt;X_1, \dots, X_m&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(X_l)_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are matrix entries and commute by definition. For example, if ''m'' = 1, then &lt;math&gt;F_1&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial ring in one variable.

For example, a [[central polynomial]] is an element of the ring &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; that will map to a central element under an evaluation. (In fact, it is in the [[invariant ring]] &lt;math&gt;k[(X_l)_{ij}]^{\operatorname{GL}_n(k)}&lt;/math&gt; since it is central and invariant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Artin|1999|loc=Proposition V.15.2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

By definition, &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; is a quotient of the [[free ring]] &lt;math&gt;k\langle t_1, \dots, t_m \rangle&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;t_i \mapsto X_i&lt;/math&gt; by the ideal consisting of all ''p'' that vanish identically on any ''n''-by-''n'' matrices over ''k''.

== Geometric perspective ==
The universal property means that any ring homomorphism from &lt;math&gt;k\langle t_1, \dots, t_m \rangle&lt;/math&gt; to a matrix ring factors through &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt;. This has a following geometric meaning. In algebraic geometry, the polynomial ring &lt;math&gt;k[t, \dots, t_m]&lt;/math&gt; is the coordinate ring of the affine space &lt;math&gt;k^m&lt;/math&gt; and to give a point of &lt;math&gt;k^m&lt;/math&gt; is to give a ring homomorphism (evaluation) &lt;math&gt;k[t, \dots, t_m] \to k&lt;/math&gt; (either by the [[Hilbert nullstellensatz]] or by the [[scheme theory]]). The free ring &lt;math&gt;k\langle t_1, \dots, t_m \rangle&lt;/math&gt; plays the role of the coordinate ring of the affine space in the [[noncommutative algebraic geometry]] (i.e., we don't demand free variables to commute) and thus a generic matrix ring of size ''n'' is the coordinate ring of a noncommutative affine variety whose points are the Spec's of matrix rings of size ''n'' (see below for a more concrete discussion.)

=== The maximal spectrum of a generic matrix ring ===
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}

For simplicity, assume ''k'' is algebraically closed. Let ''A'' be an algebra over ''k'' and let &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}_n(A)&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of all maximal ideals &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; in ''A'' such that &lt;math&gt;A/\mathfrak{m} \approx M_n(k)&lt;/math&gt;. If ''A'' is commutative, then &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}_1(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[maximal spectrum]] of ''A'' and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}_n(A)&lt;/math&gt; is empty for any &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:171879main LimbFlareJan12 lg.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Sun]] and [[Earth]] form an ongoing example of a heating process.  Some of the Sun's [[thermal radiation]] strikes and heats the Earth.  Compared to the Sun, Earth has a much lower temperature and so sends far less thermal radiation back to the Sun.  The heat of this process can be quantified by the net amount, and direction (Sun to Earth), of energy it transferred in a given period of time.]]

In [[thermodynamics]], '''heat''' is [[energy]] transferred from one system to another as a result of thermal interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Reif (1965):
"[in the special case of purely thermal interaction between two system:] The mean energy transferred from one system to the other as a result of purely thermal interaction is called 'heat'" (p. 67).
the quantity Q [...] is simply a measure of the mean energy change ''not'' due to the change of external parameters. [...] splits the total mean energy change into a part W due to mechanical interaction and a part Q due to thermal interaction  [...] by virtue of [the definition ΔE=W+Q], both heat and work have the dimensions of energy"
(p. 73).
C.f.: "heat is thermal energy in transfer" Stephen J. Blundell, Katherine M. Blundell, ''Concepts in Thermal Physics'' (2009),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=YE9uBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA13  p. 13].&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of heat transferred in any process can be defined as the total amount of transferred energy excluding any macroscopic [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] that was done and any transfer of part of the object itself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Pippard|Pippard, A.B.]] (1957/1966), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lev Landau|Landau, L.]], [[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz, E.M.]] (1958/1969), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; When two systems with different [[temperature|temperatures]] are put in contact, heat flows spontaneously from the hotter to the colder system. Transfer of energy as heat can occur through direct contact, through a barrier that is impermeable to matter (as in [[thermal conduction|conduction]]), by [[thermal radiation|radiation]] between separated bodies, by way of an intermediate fluid (as in [[Convective heat transfer|convective circulation]]), or by a combination of these.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guggenheim, E.A. (1949/1967)|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Planck. M. (1914)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar 1961"/&gt;  By contrast to [[work (thermodynamics)|work]], heat involves the [[stochastic]] (random) motion of particles (such as atoms or molecules) that is [[Equipartition theorem|equally distributed among all degrees of freedom]], while work is  confined to one or more specific [[degrees of freedom]] such as those of the [[center of mass]]. 

Like thermodynamic  [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], heat is a property of a process, not a property of a system. Energy exchanged as heat (a [[process function]]) changes the [[internal energy]] (a [[state function]]) of each system by equal and opposite amounts.   This is to be distinguished from the common conception of heat as a property of high-temperature systems.   

Although heat flows from a hotter body to a cooler one, it is possible to construct a [[heat pump]] or refrigeration system that does work to increase the difference in temperature between two systems.  In contrast, a [[heat engine]] reduces an existing temperature difference to do work on another system.

As a form of energy,  the [[SI unit]] of heat is the [[joule]] (J). The conventional symbol used to represent the amount of heat exchanged in a thermodynamic process is {{mvar|Q}}. 
Heat is measured by its effect on the states of interacting bodies, for example, by the amount of ice melted or a change in [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871), Chapter III.&lt;/ref&gt;  The quantification of heat via the temperature change of a body is called [[calorimetry]].

==Notation and units==
As a form of energy, heat has the unit [[joule]] (J) in the [[International System of Units]] (SI). However, in many applied fields in engineering the [[British thermal unit]] (BTU) and the [[calorie]] are often used. The standard unit for the rate of heat transferred is the [[watt]] (W), defined as one joule per second.

Use of the symbol {{mvar|Q}} for the total amount of energy transferred as heat is due to [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1850:
:"Let the amount of heat which must be imparted during the transition of the gas in a definite manner from any given state to another, in which its volume is ''v'' and its temperature ''t'', be called Q"&lt;ref name=Clausius1850&gt;'' Die Wärmemenge, welche dem Gase mitgetheilt werden muss, während es aus irgend einem früheren Zustande auf einem bestimmten Wege in den Zustand übergeführt wird, in welchem sein Volumen = ''v'' und seine Temperatur = ''t'' ist, möge ''Q'' heissen''
R. Clausius, [https://archive.org/stream/ueberdiebewegen00claugoog#page/n17/mode/2up ''Ueber die bewegende Kraft der Wärme und die Gesetze, welche sich daraus für die Wärmelehre selbst ableiten lassen''], communication to the Academy of Berlin, February 1850, published in Pogendorff's Annalen vol. 79, March/April 1850, first translated in Philosophical Magazine vol. 2, July 1851, as "First Memoir" in: ''The Mechanical Theory of Heat, with its Applications to the Steam-Engine and to the Physical Properties of Bodies'', trans. John Tyndall, London, 1867, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8LIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA25 p. 25].&lt;/ref&gt;

Heat released by a system into its surroundings is by convention a negative quantity ({{mvar|Q}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;0); when a system absorbs heat from its surroundings, it is positive ({{mvar|Q}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0). Heat transfer rate, or heat flow per unit time, is denoted by &lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}&lt;/math&gt;. This should not be confused with a time derivative of a [[Functions of state|function of state]] (which can also be written with the dot notation) since heat is not a function of state.&lt;ref name="Baierlein1999"&gt;Baierlein, R. (1999), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Heat flux]] is defined as rate of heat transfer per unit cross-sectional area (units watts per square metre).

==Classical thermodynamics==

===Heat and entropy===
{{main|Entropy}}
[[File:Clausius-1.jpg|thumb|120px|Rudolf Clausius]]
In 1856,  [[Rudolf Clausius]], referring to closed systems, in which transfers of matter do not occur, defined the ''second fundamental theorem'' (the [[second law of thermodynamics]]) in the mechanical [[theory of heat]] ([[thermodynamics]]): "if two transformations which, without necessitating any other permanent change, can mutually replace one another, be called equivalent, then the generations of the quantity of heat ''Q'' from [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] at the temperature ''T'', has the ''equivalence-value'':"&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius, R.]] (1854).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rudolf Clausius|Clausius, R.]] (1865), pp. 125–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; {} \frac {Q}{T}.&lt;/math&gt;

In 1865, he came to define the [[entropy]] symbolized by ''S'', such that, due to the supply of the amount of heat ''Q'' at temperature ''T'' the entropy of the system is increased by

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S = \frac {Q}{T}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(1)&lt;/math&gt;

In a transfer of energy as heat without work being done, there are changes of entropy in both the surroundings which lose heat and the system which gains it. The increase, {{math|Δ''S''}}, of entropy in the system may be considered to consist of two parts, an increment, {{math|Δ''S''′}} that matches, or 'compensates', the change, {{math|−Δ''S''′}}, of entropy in the surroundings, and a further increment, {{math|Δ''S''′′}} that may be considered to be 'generated' or 'produced' in the system, and is said therefore to be 'uncompensated'. Thus

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S = \Delta S^\prime+\Delta S^{\prime\prime} .&lt;/math&gt;

This may also be written

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S_{\mathrm{system}} = \Delta S_{\mathrm{compensated}}+\Delta S_{\mathrm{uncompensated}}\,\,\,\,\text{with}\,\,\,\,\Delta S_{\mathrm{compensated}}=-\Delta S_{\mathrm{surroundings}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The total change of entropy in the system and surroundings is thus

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S_{\mathrm{overall}} = \Delta S^\prime+\Delta S^{\prime\prime}-\Delta S^\prime=\Delta S^{\prime\prime} .&lt;/math&gt;

This may also be written

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S_{\mathrm{overall}} = \Delta S_{\mathrm{compensated}}+\Delta S_{\mathrm{uncompensated}}+\Delta S_{\mathrm{surroundings}}=\Delta S_{\mathrm{uncompensated}} .&lt;/math&gt;

It is then said that an amount of entropy {{math|Δ''S''′}} has been transferred from the surroundings to the system. Because entropy is not a conserved quantity, this is an exception to the general way of speaking, in which an amount transferred is of a conserved quantity.

From the second law of thermodynamics follows that in a spontaneous transfer of heat, in which the temperature of the system is different from that of the surroundings:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta S_{\mathrm{overall}}&gt;0 .&lt;/math&gt;

For purposes of mathematical analysis of transfers, one thinks of fictive processes that are called ''reversible'', with the temperature {{math|''T''}} of the system being hardly less than that of the surroundings, and the transfer taking place at an imperceptibly slow rate.

Following the definition above in formula (1), for such a fictive reversible process, a quantity of transferred heat {{math|δ''Q''}} (an [[inexact differential]]) is analyzed as a quantity {{math|''T'' d''S''}}, with {{math|d''S''}} (an [[exact differential]]):

:&lt;math&gt; T\,\mathrm{d}S=\delta Q .&lt;/math&gt;

This equality is only valid for a fictive transfer in which there is no production of entropy, that is to say, in which there is no uncompensated entropy.

If, in contrast, the process is natural, and can really occur, with irreversibility, then there is [[entropy production]], with {{math|d''S''&lt;sub&gt;uncompensated&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0}}. The quantity {{math|''T'' d''S''&lt;sub&gt;uncompensated&lt;/sub&gt;}} was termed by Clausius the "uncompensated heat", though that does not accord with present-day terminology. Then one has

:&lt;math&gt; T\,\mathrm{d}S=\delta Q+T\,\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm{uncompensated}} &gt; \delta Q .&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to the statement

:&lt;math&gt; T\,\mathrm{d}S \geq \delta Q \quad{\rm{(second\,\,law)}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
which is the [[second law of thermodynamics]] for closed systems.

In non-equilibrium thermodynamics that approximates by assuming the hypothesis of local thermodynamic equilibrium, there is a special notation for this. The transfer of energy as heat is assumed to take place across an infinitesimal temperature difference, so that the system element and its surroundings have near enough the same temperature {{math|''T''}}. Then one writes

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}S =\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm e}+\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm i}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

where by definition

:&lt;math&gt; \delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm e}\,\,\,\,\,\text{and}\,\,\,\,\,\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm i}\equiv\mathrm{d}S_{\mathrm {uncompensated}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The second law for a natural process asserts that
:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm d S_{\mathrm i}&gt;0 .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, S.R., [[Peter Mazur|Mazur, P.]] (1962), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D, [[Ilya Prigogine|Prigogine, I.]] (1998), p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondepudi, D. (2008), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lebon, g., Jou, D., Casas-Vásquez, J. (2008), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heat and enthalpy===
{{see|Internal energy|Enthalpy}}

For a [[closed system]] (a system from which no matter can enter or exit), one version of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] states that the change in [[internal energy]] {{math|Δ''U''}} of the system is equal to the amount of heat {{math|''Q''}} supplied to the system minus the amount of [[work (thermodynamics)|work]] {{math|''W''}} done by system on its surroundings. The foregoing sign convention for work is used in the present article, but an alternate sign convention, followed by IUPAC, for work, is to consider the work performed on the system by its surroundings as positive. This is the convention adopted by many modern textbooks of physical chemistry, such as those by [[Peter Atkins]] and Ira Levine, but many textbooks on physics define work as work done by the system.

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U = Q - W \, . &lt;/math&gt;

This formula can be re-written so as to express a definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat, based purely on the concept of adiabatic work, if it is supposed that {{math|Δ''U''}} is defined and measured solely by processes of adiabatic work:

:&lt;math&gt; Q = \Delta U + W.&lt;/math&gt;

The work done by the system includes boundary work (when the system increases its volume against an external force, such as that exerted by a piston) and other work (e.g. shaft work performed by a compressor fan), which is called isochoric work:

:&lt;math&gt; Q = \Delta U + W_\text{boundary} + W_\text{isochoric}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this Section we will neglect the "other-" or isochoric work contribution.

The internal energy, {{math|''U''}}, is a [[state function]]. In cyclical processes, such as the operation of a heat engine, state functions of the working substance return to their initial values upon completion of a cycle.

The differential, or infinitesimal increment, for the internal energy in an infinitesimal process is an [[exact differential]] {{math|d''U''}}. The symbol for [[exact differential]]s is the lowercase letter {{math|d}}.

In contrast, neither of the infinitesimal increments {{math|δ''Q''}} nor {{math|δ''W''}} in an infinitesimal process represents the state of the system. Thus, infinitesimal increments of heat and work are inexact differentials. The lowercase Greek letter delta, {{math|δ}}, is the symbol for [[inexact differential]]s. The integral of any inexact differential over the time it takes for a system to leave and return to the same thermodynamic state does not necessarily equal zero.

As recounted below, in the section headed [[#Entropy|Entropy]], the second law of thermodynamics observes that if heat is supplied to a system in which no irreversible processes take place and which has a well-defined temperature {{math|''T''}}, the increment of heat {{math|δ''Q''}} and the temperature {{math|''T''}} form the [[exact differential]]

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}S =\frac{\delta Q}{T},&lt;/math&gt;

and that {{math|''S''}}, the entropy of the working body, is a function of state. Likewise, with a well-defined pressure, {{math|''P''}}, behind the moving boundary, the work differential, {{math|δ''W''}}, and the pressure, {{math|''P''}}, combine to form the exact differential

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}V =\frac{\delta W}{P},&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|''V''}} the volume of the system, which is a state variable. In general, for homogeneous systems,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\mathrm{d}S - P\mathrm{d}V.&lt;/math&gt;

Associated with this differential equation is that the internal energy may be considered to be a function {{math|''U'' (''S'',''V'')}} of its [[Thermodynamic potential|natural variables]] {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''V''}}. The internal energy representation of the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] is written
:&lt;math&gt;U=U(S,V).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]], (1985), Section 2-3, pp. 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins 1983 101"&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1983), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

If {{math|''V''}} is constant

:&lt;math&gt;T\mathrm{d}S=\mathrm{d}U\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(V\,\, \text{constant)}&lt;/math&gt;

and if {{math|''P''}} is constant

:&lt;math&gt;T\mathrm{d}S=\mathrm{d}H\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(P\,\, \text{constant)}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{math|''H''}} the enthalpy defined by

:&lt;math&gt;H=U+PV.&lt;/math&gt;

The enthalpy may be considered to be a function {{math|''H'' (''S'',''P'')}} of its natural variables {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''P''}}. The enthalpy representation of the fundamental thermodynamic relation is written
:&lt;math&gt;H=H(S,P).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Adkins 1983 101"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Callen 147"&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1985), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The internal energy representation and the enthalpy representation are [[Legendre transformation|partial Legendre transforms]] of one another. They contain the same physical information, written in different ways. Like the internal energy, the enthalpy stated as a function of its natural variables is a thermodynamic potential and contains all thermodynamic information about a body.&lt;ref name="Callen 147"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1983), pp. 100–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a quantity {{math|''Q''}} of heat is added to a body while it does expansion work {{math|''W''}} on its surroundings, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H=\Delta U + \Delta(PV)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If this is constrained to happen at constant pressure with {{math|Δ''P'' {{=}} 0}}, the expansion work {{math|''W''}} done by the body is given by {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''P'' Δ''V''}}; recalling the first law of thermodynamics, one has

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta U=Q - W=Q - P\, \Delta V \text{   and   }\Delta (PV) = P\, \Delta V \,.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently, by substitution one has

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H=Q - P\, \Delta V + P\, \Delta V&lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt;=Q\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text{at constant pressure.}&lt;/math&gt;

In this scenario, the increase in enthalpy is equal to the quantity of heat added to the system. Since many processes do take place at constant pressure, or approximately at atmospheric pressure, the enthalpy is therefore sometimes given the misleading name of 'heat content'.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes also called the heat function.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the natural variables {{math|''S'' and ''P''}} of the state function {{math|''H''}}, this process of change of state from state 1 to state 2 can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H=\int_{S_1}^{S_2} \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right)_P \mathrm dS +\int_{P_1}^{P_2} \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial P}\right)_S \mathrm dP&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;=\int_{S_1}^{S_2} \left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right)_P \mathrm dS\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text{at constant pressure.}&lt;/math&gt;

It is known that the temperature {{math|''T''(''S'', ''P'')}} is identically stated by

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial S}\right)_P \equiv T(S,P)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Consequently,

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta H=\int_{S_1}^{S_2} T(S,P) \mathrm dS\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\, \text{at constant pressure.}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the integral specifies a quantity of heat transferred at constant pressure.

==History==
{{main|History of thermodynamics}}

As a common noun, English ''heat'' or ''warmth'' (just as French ''chaleur'', German ''Wärme'', Latin ''calor'', Greek θάλπος, etc.) refers to (the human [[thermoception|perception of]]) either [[thermal energy]] or [[temperature]]. Speculation on thermal energy or "heat" as a separate form of matter has a long history, see [[caloric theory]], [[phlogiston]] and [[fire (classical element)]].

The modern understanding of thermal energy originates with   [[Benjamin Thompson|Thompson]]'s 1798 [[mechanical theory of heat]] (''[[An Experimental Enquiry Concerning the Source of the Heat which is Excited by Friction]]''), postulating a [[mechanical equivalent of heat]].
A collaboration between [[Nicolas Clément]] and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] (''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'')  in the 1820s had some related thinking near the same lines.&lt;ref&gt;Lervig, P. Sadi Carnot and the steam engine:Nicolas Clément's lectures on industrial chemistry, 1823-28. Br. J Hist. Sci. 18::147, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845, Joule published a paper entitled ''The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat'', in which he specified a numerical value for the amount of mechanical work required to "produce a unit of heat".
The theory of classical thermodynamics matured in the 1850s to 1860s. [[John Tyndall]]'s ''Heat Considered as Mode of Motion'' (1863) was instrumental in popularising the idea of heat as motion to the English-speaking public.
The theory was developed in academic publications in French, English and German. From an early time, the French technical term ''chaleur'' used by Carnot was taken as equivalent to the English ''heat'' and German ''Wärme'' (lit. "warmth", the equivalent of ''heat'' would be German ''Hitze'').

The process function {{mvar|Q}}  was  introduced by [[Rudolf Clausius]] in 1850. 
Clausius described it with the German compound ''Wärmemenge'', translated as "amount of heat".&lt;ref name=Clausius1850/&gt;

[[James Clerk Maxwell]] in his 1871  ''Theory of Heat'' outlines four stipulations for the definition of heat:
* It is ''something which may be transferred from one body to another'', according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]].
* It is a ''measurable quantity'', and so can be treated mathematically.
* It ''cannot be treated as a material substance'', because it may be transformed into something that is not a material substance, e.g., [[mechanical work]].
* Heat is ''one of the forms of energy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[process function]] {{mvar|Q}} is referred to as ''Wärmemenge'' by Clausius, or as "amount of heat" in translation.
Use of "heat" as an abbreviated of the specific concept of "amount of heat being transferred"  led to some terminological confusion by the early 20th century. The generic meaning of "heat", even in classical thermodynamics, is just "thermal energy".&lt;ref&gt;"in a gas, heat is nothing else than the kinetic or mechanical energy of motion of the gas molecules". B.L. Loeb, ''The Kinetic Theory of Gases'' (1927), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the 1920s, it has been recommended practice to use [[enthalpy]] to refer to the "heat content at constant volume", and to [[thermal energy]] when "heat" in the general sense is intended, while "heat" is reserved for the very specific context of the transfer of thermal energy between two systems.
[[Leonard Benedict Loeb]] in his ''Kinetic Theory of Gases'' (1927) makes a point of using "quanitity of heat" 
or "heat&amp;ndash;quantity" when referring to {{mvar|Q}}:&lt;ref&gt;From this terminological choice may derive a tradition to the effect that the letter ''Q'' represents "quantity", but there is no indication that Clausius had this in mind when he selected the letter in what seemed to be an ''ad hoc'' calculation in 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;
:After the perfection of thermometry [...] the next great advance made in the field of heat was the definition of a term which is called the quantity of heat.  [... after the abandonment of [[caloric theory]],] It still remains to interpret this very definite concept, the quantity of heat, in terms of a theory ascribing all heat to the kinetics of gas molecules. 
&lt;ref&gt;B.L. Loeb, ''The Kinetic Theory of Gases'' (1927), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=KNh0PFk7CnwC&amp;pg=PA426 p. 426].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carathéodory (1909)===
A frequent definition of heat is based on the work of [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]] (1909), referring to processes in a closed system.&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Münster, A. (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pippard, A.B. (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R., Guggenheim, E.A. (1939).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchdahl, H.A. (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[internal energy]] {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of a body in an arbitrary state {{math|''X''}} can be determined by amounts of work adiabatically performed by the body on its surroundings when it starts from a reference state {{math|''O''}}. Such work is assessed through quantities defined in the surroundings of the body. It is supposed that such work can be assessed accurately, without error due to friction in the surroundings; friction in the body is not excluded by this definition. The adiabatic performance of work is defined in terms of adiabatic walls, which allow transfer of energy as work, but no other transfer, of energy or matter. In particular they do not allow the passage of energy as heat. According to this definition, work performed adiabatically is in general accompanied by friction within the thermodynamic system or body. On the other hand, according to Carathéodory (1909), there also exist non-adiabatic, ''diathermal'' walls, which are postulated to be permeable only to heat.

For the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat, it is customarily envisaged that an arbitrary state of interest {{math|''Y''}} is reached from state {{math|''O''}} by a process with two components, one adiabatic and the other not adiabatic. For convenience one may say that the adiabatic component was the sum of work done by the body through volume change through movement of the walls while the non-adiabatic wall was temporarily rendered adiabatic, and of isochoric adiabatic work. Then the non-adiabatic component is a process of energy transfer through the wall that passes only heat, newly made accessible for the purpose of this transfer, from the surroundings to the body. The change in internal energy to reach the state {{math|''Y''}} from the state {{math|''O''}} is the difference of the two amounts of energy transferred.

Although Carathéodory himself did not state such a definition, following his work it is customary in theoretical studies to define heat, {{math|''Q''}}, to the body from its surroundings, in the combined process of change to state {{math|''Y''}} from the state {{math|''O''}}, as the change in internal energy, {{math|Δ''U&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, minus the amount of work, {{math|''W''}}, done by the body on its surrounds by the adiabatic process, so that {{math|''Q'' {{=}} Δ''U&lt;sub&gt;Y&lt;/sub&gt;'' − ''W''}}.

In this definition, for the sake of conceptual rigour, the quantity of energy transferred as heat is not specified directly in terms of the non-adiabatic process. It is defined through knowledge of precisely two variables, the change of internal energy and the amount of adiabatic work done, for the combined process of change from the reference state {{math|''O''}} to the arbitrary state {{math|''Y''}}. It is important that this does not explicitly involve the amount of energy transferred in the non-adiabatic component of the combined process. It is assumed here that the amount of energy required to pass from state {{math|''O''}} to state {{math|''Y''}}, the change of internal energy, is known, independently of the combined process, by a determination through a purely adiabatic process, like that for the determination of the internal energy of state {{math|''X''}} above. The rigour that is prized in this definition is that there is one and only one kind of energy transfer admitted as fundamental: energy transferred as work. Energy transfer as heat is considered as a derived quantity. The uniqueness of work in this scheme is considered to guarantee rigor and purity of conception. The conceptual purity of this definition, based on the concept of energy transferred as work as an ideal notion, relies on the idea that some frictionless and otherwise non-dissipative processes of energy transfer can be realized in physical actuality. The second law of thermodynamics, on the other hand, assures us that such processes are not found in nature.

Before the rigorous mathematical definition of heat based on Carathéodory's 1909 paper, 
historically, heat, temperature, and thermal equilibrium were presented in thermodynamics textbooks as jointly [[primitive notion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Carathéodory introduced his 1909 paper thus: "The proposition that the discipline of thermodynamics can be justified without recourse to any hypothesis that cannot be verified experimentally must be regarded as one of the most noteworthy results of the research in thermodynamics that was accomplished during the last century." Referring to the "point of view adopted by most authors who were active in the last fifty years", Carathéodory wrote: "There exists a physical quantity called heat that is not identical with the mechanical quantities (mass, force, pressure, etc.) and whose variations can be determined by calorimetric measurements." [[James Serrin]] introduces an account of the theory of thermodynamics thus: "In the following section, we shall use the classical notions of ''heat'', ''work'', and ''hotness'' as primitive elements, ... That heat is an appropriate and natural primitive for thermodynamics was already accepted by Carnot. Its continued validity as a primitive element of thermodynamical structure is due to the fact that it synthesizes an essential physical concept, as well as to its successful use in recent work to unify different constitutive theories."&lt;ref&gt;Serrin, J. (1986), p. 5 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen, D.R. (1984), pp. 43–45.&lt;/ref&gt; This traditional kind of presentation of the basis of thermodynamics includes ideas that may be summarized by the statement that heat transfer is purely due to spatial non-uniformity of temperature, and is by conduction and radiation, from hotter to colder bodies. It is sometimes proposed that this traditional kind of presentation necessarily rests on "circular reasoning"; against this proposal, there stands the rigorously logical mathematical development of the theory presented by Truesdell and Bharatha (1977).&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell, C.]], Bharatha, S. (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternative approach to the definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat differs in logical structure from that of Carathéodory, recounted just above.

This alternative approach admits calorimetry as a primary or direct way to measure quantity of energy transferred as heat. It relies on temperature as one of its primitive concepts, and used in calorimetry.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871), p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; It is presupposed that enough processes exist physically to allow measurement of differences in internal energies. Such processes are not restricted to adiabatic transfers of energy as work. They include calorimetry, which is the commonest practical way of finding internal energy differences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Atkins|Atkins, P.]], de Paula, J. (1978/2010), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; The needed temperature can be either empirical or absolute thermodynamic.

In contrast, the Carathéodory way recounted just above does not use calorimetry or temperature in its primary definition of quantity of energy transferred as heat. The Carathéodory way regards calorimetry only as a secondary or indirect way of measuring quantity of energy transferred as heat. As recounted in more detail just above, the Carathéodory way regards quantity of energy transferred as heat in a process as primarily or directly defined as a residual quantity. It is calculated from the difference of the internal energies of the initial and final states of the system, and from the actual work done by the system during the process. That internal energy difference is supposed to have been measured in advance through processes of purely adiabatic transfer of energy as work, processes that take the system between the initial and final states. By the Carathéodory way it is presupposed as known from experiment that there actually physically exist enough such adiabatic processes, so that there need be no recourse to calorimetry for measurement of quantity of energy transferred as heat. This presupposition is essential but is explicitly labeled neither as a law of thermodynamics nor as an axiom of the Carathéodory way. In fact, the actual physical existence of such adiabatic processes is indeed mostly supposition, and those supposed processes have in most cases not been actually verified empirically to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Pippard|Pippard, A.B.]] (1957/1966), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat transfer==
{{main|Heat transfer}}
===Heat transfer between two bodies===
Referring to conduction, [[J.R. Partington|Partington]] writes: "If a hot body is brought in conducting contact with a cold body, the temperature of the hot body falls and that of the cold body rises, and it is said that a ''quantity of heat'' has passed from the hot body to the cold body."&lt;ref&gt;[[J.R. Partington|Partington, J.R.]] (1949), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Referring to radiation, [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] writes: "In Radiation, the hotter body loses heat, and the colder body receives heat by means of a process occurring in some intervening medium which does not itself thereby become hot."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell writes that convection as such "is not a purely thermal phenomenon".&lt;ref&gt;[[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell, J.C.]] (1871), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In thermodynamics, convection in general is regarded as transport of [[internal energy]]. If, however, the convection is enclosed and circulatory, then it may be regarded as an intermediary that transfers energy as heat between source and destination bodies, because it transfers only energy and not matter from the source to the destination body.&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar 1961"&gt;[[Subrahamanyan Chandrasekhar|Chandrasekhar, S.]] (1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with the first law for closed systems, energy transferred solely as heat leaves one body and enters another, changing the internal energies of each. Transfer, between bodies, of energy as work is a complementary way of changing internal energies. Though it is not logically rigorous from the viewpoint of strict physical concepts, a common form of words that expresses this is to say that heat and work are interconvertible.

Cyclically operating engines, that use only heat and work transfers, have two thermal reservoirs, a hot and a cold one. They may be classified by the range of operating temperatures of the working body, relative to those reservoirs. In a heat engine, the  working body is at all times colder than the hot reservoir and hotter than the cold reservoir. In a sense, it uses heat transfer to produce work. In a heat pump, the working body, at stages of the cycle, goes both hotter than the hot reservoir, and colder than the cold reservoir. In a sense, it uses work to produce heat transfer.

===Heat engine===
In classical thermodynamics, a commonly considered model is the [[heat engine]]. It consists of four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state, and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often. Work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged as reversible, and thus only one work reservoir is needed. But two thermal reservoirs are needed, because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible. A single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from the hot reservoir and sent to the two other reservoirs, the work reservoir and the cold reservoir. The hot reservoir always and only supplies energy and the cold reservoir always and only receives energy. The second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by the cold reservoir. Heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the difference between initial and final temperature is greater.

===Heat pump or refrigerator===
Another commonly considered model is the [[heat pump]] or refrigerator. Again there are four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A single cycle starts with the working body colder than the cold reservoir, and then energy is taken in as heat by the working body from the cold reservoir. Then the work reservoir does work on the working body, adding more to its internal energy, making it hotter than the hot reservoir. The hot working body passes heat to the hot reservoir, but still remains hotter than the cold reservoir. Then, by allowing it to expand without doing work on another body and without passing heat to another body, the working body is made colder than the cold reservoir. It can now accept heat transfer from the cold reservoir to start another cycle.

The device has transported energy from a colder to a hotter reservoir, but this is not regarded as by an inanimate agency; rather, it is regarded as by the harnessing of work . This is because work is supplied from the work reservoir, not just by a simple thermodynamic process, but by a cycle of [[thermodynamic operation]]s and processes, which may be regarded as directed by an animate or harnessing agency. Accordingly, the cycle is still in accord with the second law of thermodynamics. The efficiency of a heat pump is best when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is least.

Functionally, such engines are used in two ways, distinguishing a target reservoir and a resource or surrounding reservoir. A heat pump transfers heat, to the hot reservoir as the target, from the resource or surrounding reservoir. A refrigerator transfers heat, from the cold reservoir as the target, to the resource or surrounding reservoir. The target reservoir may be regarded as leaking: when the target leaks hotness to the surroundings, heat pumping is used; when the target leaks coldness to the surroundings, refrigeration is used. The engines harness work to overcome the leaks.

===Macroscopic view===
{{rewrite section|date=May 2016}}
According to [[Planck]], there are three main conceptual approaches to heat.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1897/1903), p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt; One is the microscopic or kinetic theory approach. The other two are macroscopic approaches. One is the approach through the law of conservation of energy taken as prior to thermodynamics, with a mechanical analysis of processes, for example in the work of Helmholtz. This mechanical view is taken in this article as currently customary for thermodynamic theory. The other macroscopic approach is the thermodynamic one, which admits heat as a primitive concept, which contributes, by scientific induction&lt;ref&gt;[[Jaakko Hintikka|Hintikka, J.]] (1988), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; to knowledge of the law of conservation of energy. This view is widely taken as the practical one, quantity of heat being measured by calorimetry.

Bailyn also distinguishes the two macroscopic approaches as the mechanical and the thermodynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 65, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; The thermodynamic view was taken by the founders of thermodynamics in the nineteenth century. It regards quantity of energy transferred as heat as a primitive concept coherent with a primitive concept of temperature, measured primarily by calorimetry. A calorimeter is a body in the surroundings of the system, with its own temperature and internal energy; when it is connected to the system by a path for heat transfer, changes in it measure heat transfer. The mechanical view was pioneered by Helmholtz and developed and used in the twentieth century, largely through the influence of [[Max Born]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]](1949), Lecture {{math|''V''}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It regards quantity of heat transferred as heat as a derived concept, defined for closed systems as quantity of heat transferred by mechanisms other than work transfer, the latter being regarded as primitive for thermodynamics, defined by macroscopic mechanics. According to Born, the transfer of internal energy between open systems that accompanies transfer of matter "cannot be reduced to mechanics".&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that there is no well-founded definition of quantities of energy transferred as heat or as work associated with transfer of matter.

Nevertheless, for the thermodynamical description of non-equilibrium processes, it is desired to consider the effect of a temperature gradient established by the surroundings across the system of interest when there is no physical barrier or wall between system and surroundings, that is to say, when they are open with respect to one another. The impossibility of a mechanical definition in terms of work for this circumstance does not alter the physical fact that a temperature gradient causes a diffusive flux of internal energy, a process that, in the thermodynamic view, might be proposed as a candidate concept for transfer of energy as heat.

In this circumstance, it may be expected that there may also be active other drivers of diffusive flux of internal energy, such as gradient of chemical potential which drives transfer of matter, and gradient of electric potential which drives electric current and iontophoresis; such effects usually interact with diffusive flux of internal energy driven by temperature gradient, and such interactions are known as cross-effects.&lt;ref&gt;De Groot, S.R., Mazur, P. (1962), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

If cross-effects that result in diffusive transfer of internal energy were also labeled as heat transfers, they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down a temperature gradient, never up one. They would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer is of one and the same kind, a principle founded on the idea of heat conduction between closed systems. One might to try to think narrowly of heat flux driven purely by temperature gradient as a conceptual component of diffusive internal energy flux, in the thermodynamic view, the concept resting specifically on careful calculations based on detailed knowledge of the processes and being indirectly assessed. In these circumstances, if perchance it happens that no transfer of matter is actualized, and there are no cross-effects, then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept coincide, as if one were dealing with closed systems. But when there is transfer of matter, the exact laws by which temperature gradient drives diffusive flux of internal energy, rather than being exactly knowable, mostly need to be assumed, and in many cases are practically unverifiable. Consequently, when there is transfer of matter, the calculation of the pure 'heat flux' component of the diffusive flux of internal energy rests on practically unverifiable assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K.G. (1951), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=quotations&gt;Denbigh states in a footnote that he is indebted to correspondence with [[Edward A. Guggenheim|Professor E.A. Guggenheim]] and with Professor N.K. Adam. From this, Denbigh concludes "It seems, however, that when a system is able to exchange both heat and matter with its environment, it is impossible to make an unambiguous distinction between energy transported as heat and by the migration of matter, without already assuming the existence of the 'heat of transport'." Denbigh K.G. (1951), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitts, D.D. (1962), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reason to think of heat as a specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely to closed systems, and applicable only in a very restricted way to open systems.

In many writings in this context, the term "heat flux" is used when what is meant is therefore more accurately called diffusive flux of internal energy; such usage of the term "heat flux" is a residue of older and now obsolete language usage that allowed that a body may have a "heat content".&lt;ref&gt;Gyarmati, I. (1970), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microscopic view===
In the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]], heat is explained in terms of the microscopic motions and interactions of constituent particles, such as electrons, atoms, and molecules.&lt;ref name="Kittel &amp; Kroemer"&gt;Kittel, C. Kroemer, H. (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate meaning of the kinetic energy of the constituent particles is not as heat. It is as a component of internal energy. 
In microscopic terms, heat is a transfer quantity, and is described by a transport theory, not as steadily localized kinetic energy of particles. Heat transfer arises from temperature gradients or differences, through the diffuse exchange of microscopic kinetic and potential particle energy, by particle collisions and other interactions. An early and vague expression of this was made by [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, F. (1620).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Partington, J.R. (1949), page 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Precise and detailed versions of it were developed in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Partington, J.R. (1949), pages 132–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[statistical mechanics]], for a closed system (no transfer of matter), heat is the energy transfer associated with a disordered, microscopic action on the system, associated with jumps in occupation numbers of the energy levels of the system, without change in the values of the energy levels themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Reif (1965), pp.67-68&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible for macroscopic thermodynamic work to alter the occupation numbers without change in the values of the system energy levels themselves, but what distinguishes transfer as heat is that the transfer is entirely due to disordered, microscopic action, including radiative transfer. A [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)#Microscopic definitions of thermodynamic concepts|mathematical definition]] can be formulated for small increments of quasi-static adiabatic work in terms of the statistical distribution of an ensemble of microstates.

===Calorimetry===
{{main|Calorimetry}}
Quantity of heat transferred can be measured by calorimetry, or determined through calculations based on other quantities.

Calorimetry is the empirical basis of the idea of quantity of heat transferred in a process. The transferred heat is measured by changes in a body of known properties, for example, temperature rise, change in volume or length, or phase change, such as melting of ice.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell J.C. (1872), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Planck (1927), Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A calculation of quantity of heat transferred can rely on a hypothetical quantity of energy transferred as [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] work and on the [[first law of thermodynamics]]. Such calculation is the primary approach of many theoretical studies of quantity of heat transferred.&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"&gt;[[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory, C.]] (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryan 47"&gt;Bryan, G.H. (1907), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1985), Section 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Engineering===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A red-hot iron rod from which [[heat transfer]] to the surrounding environment will be primarily through [[Thermal radiation|radiation]].]]
The discipline of [[heat transfer]], typically considered an aspect of [[mechanical engineering]] and [[chemical engineering]], deals with specific applied methods by which thermal energy in a system is generated, or converted, or transferred to another system. Although the definition of heat implicitly means the transfer of energy, the term ''heat transfer'' encompasses this traditional usage in many engineering disciplines and laymen language.

''Heat transfer'' is generally described as including the mechanisms of [[heat conduction]], [[heat convection]], [[thermal radiation]], but may include [[mass transfer]] and heat in processes of [[phase changes]].

Convection may be described as the combined effects of conduction and fluid flow. From the thermodynamic point of view, heat flows into a fluid by diffusion to increase its energy, the fluid then transfers ([[advection|advects]]) this increased internal energy (not heat) from one location to another, and this is then followed by a second thermal interaction which transfers heat to a second body or system, again by diffusion. This entire process is often regarded as an additional mechanism of heat transfer, although technically, "heat transfer" and thus heating and cooling occurs only on either end of such a conductive flow, but not as a result of flow. Thus, conduction can be said to "transfer" heat only as a net result of the process, but may not do so at every time within the complicated convective process.

==Latent and sensible heat==
[[File:Black Joseph.jpg|thumb|120px|Joseph Black]]
In an 1847 lecture entitled ''On Matter, Living Force, and Heat'', [[James Prescott Joule]] characterized the terms [[latent heat]] and [[sensible heat]] as components of heat each affecting distinct physical phenomena, namely the potential and kinetic energy of particles, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Prescott Joule|Joule J.P.]] (1884).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=quotations&gt;"Heat must therefore consist of either living force or of attraction through space. In the former case we can conceive the constituent particles of heated bodies to be, either in whole or in part, in a state of motion. In the latter we may suppose the particles to be removed by the process of heating, so as to exert attraction through greater space. I am inclined to believe that both of these hypotheses will be found to hold good,—that in some instances, particularly in the case of sensible heat, or such as is indicated by the thermometer, heat will be found to consist in the living force of the particles of the bodies in which it is induced; whilst in others, particularly in the case of latent heat, the phenomena are produced by the separation of particle from particle, so as to cause them to attract one another through a greater space." [[James Prescott Joule|Joule, J.P.]] (1884).&lt;/ref&gt; 
He described latent energy as the energy possessed via a distancing of particles where attraction was over a greater distance, i.e. a form of [[potential energy]], and the sensible heat as an energy involving the motion of particles, i.e. [[kinetic energy]].

Latent heat is the heat released or absorbed by a [[chemical substance]] or a [[thermodynamic system]] during a change of [[state of matter|state]] that occurs without a change in temperature. Such a process may be a [[phase transition]], such as the melting of ice or the boiling of water.&lt;ref name="Perrot" &gt;Perrot, P. (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J.O.E. (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Heat capacity==
''Heat capacity'' is a [[measurement|measurable]] [[physical quantity]] equal to the ratio of the heat added to an object to the resulting [[temperature]] change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Halliday|first1=David|last2=Resnick|first2=Robert|title=Fundamentals of Physics|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|page=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''molar heat capacity'' is the heat capacity per unit amount (SI unit: [[Mole (unit)|mole]]) of a pure substance, and the ''specific heat capacity'', often called simply ''specific heat'', is the heat capacity per unit mass of a material. Heat capacity is a physical property of a substance, which means that it depends on the state and properties of the substance under consideration.

The specific heats of monatomic gases, such as helium, are nearly constant with temperature. Diatomic gases such as hydrogen display some temperature dependence, and triatomic gases (e.g., carbon dioxide) still more.

Before the development of the laws of thermodynamics, heat was measured by changes in the states of the participating bodies.

Some general rules, with important exceptions, can be stated as follows.

In general, most bodies expand on heating. In this circumstance, heating a body at a constant volume increases the pressure it exerts on its constraining walls, while heating at a constant pressure increases its volume.

Beyond this, most substances have three ordinarily recognized [[states of matter]], solid, liquid, and gas. Some can also exist in a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Many have further, more finely differentiated, states of matter, such as for example, [[glass]], and [[liquid crystal]]. In many cases, at fixed temperature and pressure, a substance can exist in several distinct states of matter in what might be viewed as the same 'body'. For example, ice may float in a glass of water. Then the ice and the water are said to constitute two [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s within the 'body'. Definite [[Phase rule|rules]] are known, telling how distinct phases may coexist in a 'body'. Mostly, at a fixed pressure, there is a definite temperature at which heating causes a solid to melt or evaporate, and a definite temperature at which heating causes a liquid to evaporate. In such cases, cooling has the reverse effects.

All of these, the commonest cases, fit with a rule that heating can be measured by changes of state of a body. Such cases supply what are called [[Thermometer|''thermometric bodies'']], that allow the definition of empirical temperatures. Before 1848, all temperatures were defined in this way. There was thus a tight link, apparently logically determined, between heat and temperature, though they were recognized as conceptually thoroughly distinct, especially by [[Joseph Black]] in the later eighteenth century.

There are important exceptions. They break the obviously apparent link between heat and temperature. They make it clear that empirical definitions of temperature are contingent on the peculiar properties of particular thermometric substances, and are thus precluded from the title 'absolute'. For example, [[Properties of water#Physics and chemistry|water contracts]] on being heated near 277&amp;nbsp;K. It cannot be used as a thermometric substance near that temperature. Also, over a certain temperature range, ice contracts on heating. Moreover, many substances can exist in metastable states, such as with negative pressure, that survive only transiently and in very special conditions. Such facts, sometimes called 'anomalous', are some of the reasons for the thermodynamic definition of absolute temperature.

In the early days of measurement of high temperatures, another factor was important, and used by [[Josiah Wedgwood]] in his [[Pyrometer#History|pyrometer]]. The temperature reached in a process was estimated by the shrinkage of a sample of clay. The higher the temperature, the more the shrinkage. This was the only available more or less reliable method of measurement of temperatures above 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. But such shrinkage is irreversible. The clay does not expand again on cooling. That is why it could be used for the measurement. But only once. It is not a thermometric material in the usual sense of the word.

Nevertheless, the [[Temperature#Thermodynamic approach to temperature|thermodynamic definition]] of absolute temperature does make essential use of the concept of heat, with proper circumspection.

=="Hotness"==
According to Denbigh (1981), the property of hotness is a concern of thermodynamics that should be defined without reference to the concept of heat. Consideration of hotness leads to the concept of empirical temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Denbigh, K. (1981), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; All physical systems are capable of heating or cooling others.&lt;ref&gt;Baierlein, R. (1999), p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt; With reference to hotness, the comparative terms hotter and colder are defined by the rule that heat flows from the hotter body to the colder.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983), p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pippard, A.B. (1957/1966), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

If a physical system is inhomogeneous or very rapidly or irregularly changing, for example by turbulence, it may be impossible to characterize it by a temperature, but still there can be transfer of energy as heat between it and another system. If a system has a physical state that is regular enough, and persists long enough to allow it to reach thermal equilibrium with a specified thermometer, then it has a temperature according to that thermometer. An empirical thermometer registers degree of hotness for such a system. Such a temperature is called empirical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mach|Mach, E.]] (1900), section 5, pp. 48–49, section 22, pages 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell, C.]] (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Serrin|Serrin, J.]] (1986), especially p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Truesdell writes about classical thermodynamics: "At each time, the body is assigned a real number called the ''temperature''. This number is a measure of how hot the body is."&lt;ref&gt;[[Clifford Truesdell|Truesdell, C.]] (1969), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical systems that are too turbulent to have temperatures may still differ in hotness. A physical system that passes heat to another physical system is said to be the hotter of the two. More is required for the system to have a thermodynamic temperature. Its behavior must be so regular that its empirical temperature is the same for all suitably calibrated and scaled thermometers, and then its hotness is said to lie on the one-dimensional hotness manifold. This is part of the reason why heat is defined following Carathéodory and Born, solely as occurring other than by work or transfer of matter; temperature is advisedly and deliberately not mentioned in this now widely accepted definition.

This is also the reason that the [[zeroth law of thermodynamics]] is stated explicitly. If three physical systems, ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are each not in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, it is possible that, with suitable physical connections being made between them, ''A'' can heat ''B'' and ''B'' can heat ''C'' and ''C'' can heat ''A''. In non-equilibrium situations, cycles of flow are possible. It is the special and uniquely distinguishing characteristic of internal thermodynamic equilibrium that this possibility is not open to thermodynamic systems (as distinguished amongst physical systems) which are in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium; this is the reason why the zeroth law of thermodynamics needs explicit statement. That is to say, the relation 'is not colder than' between general non-equilibrium physical systems is not transitive, whereas, in contrast, the relation 'has no lower a temperature than' between thermodynamic systems in their own states of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is transitive. It follows from this that the relation 'is in thermal equilibrium with' is transitive, which is one way of stating the zeroth law.

Just as temperature may be undefined for a sufficiently inhomogeneous system, so also may entropy be undefined for a system not in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. For example, 'the temperature of the solar system' is not a defined quantity. Likewise, 'the entropy of the solar system' is not defined in classical thermodynamics. It has not been possible to define non-equilibrium entropy, as a simple number for a whole system, in a clearly satisfactory way.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (2003), page 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Ideonella sakaiensis}}
In 2016 [[Ideonella sakaiensis|''I. sakaiensis'']] was shown to degrade [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], a [[polymer]] widely used in food containers, bottles and synthetic fibers. Adhered to a low-grade PET film, the bacteria used two novel [[enzyme]]s to decompose the plastic into two environmentally benign substances, which served as their main food source.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-species-of-bacteria-eats-plastic-1457636401|title=New Species of Bacteria Eats Plastic|last=Long|first=Kat|date=March 10, 2016|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|issn=0099-9660|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A colony of ''I. sakaiensis'' could completely degrade a low-grade plastic water bottle in six weeks. Higher-grade PET products would require heating and cooling to weaken it before bacteria could start eating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The bacteria could also be used to reduce industrial waste during plastics manufacturing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In topology, a branch of mathematics, given a topological monoid ''X'' up to homotopy (in a nice way), an '''infinite loop space machine''' produces a [[group completion]] of ''X'' together with [[infinite loop space]] structure. For example, one can take ''X'' to be the [[classifying space]] of a [[symmetric monoidal category]] ''S''; that is, &lt;math&gt;X = BS&lt;/math&gt;. Then the machine produces the group completion &lt;math&gt;BS \to K(S)&lt;/math&gt;. The space &lt;math&gt;K(S)&lt;/math&gt; may be described by the [[K-theory spectrum]] of ''S''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6148">The '''Interception Modernisation Programme''' (IMP) is a [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]] initiative to extend the government's capabilities for [[lawful interception]] and storage of [[communications data]]. It has been widely reported that the IMP's eventual goal is to store details of all UK communications data in a central database.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/07/detica_interception_modernisation/ Spy chiefs plot £12bn IT spree for comms überdatabase]&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal is similar to the NSA Call Database ([[MAINWAY]]) established by [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]]'s American counterpart NSA and the [[Titan traffic database]] established by the Swedish [[National Defence Radio Establishment]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 2008 plans were being made to collect data on all [[Telephone call|phone calls]], [[email]]s, [[Chat room|chatroom discussions]] and [[World Wide Web|web-browsing]] habits as part of the IMP, thought likely to require the insertion of 'thousands' of [[black box]] probes into the country’s computer and telephone networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=There’s no hiding place as spy HQ plans to see all |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4882622.ece |work=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=October 5, 2008 |accessdate=2009-02-08  | location=London | first=David | last=Leppard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposals were expected to be included in the [[Communications Data Bill 2008]]. The "giant database" would include telephone numbers dialed, the websites visited and addresses to which e-mails are sent "but not the content of e-mails or telephone conversations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Concern over giant database idea  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7671046.stm |quote=The government's terror watchdog has expressed concern about proposals for a giant database to store details of all phone calls, e-mails and internet use. |work=[[BBC]] |date=October 15, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Huhne]], the [[Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokesman|Liberal Democrat Home affairs spokesman]] said: "The government's [[Orwellian]] plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Giant database plan 'Orwellian'  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7671046.stm |quote=Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said: "The government's Orwellian plans for a vast database of our private communications are deeply worrying."

The [[Home Office]] denied reports that a prototype of the IMP had already been built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/home-office-denies-prototype-intercept-database-4010012526/ Home Office denies prototype intercept database]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports in April 2009 suggest that the government has changed its public stance to one of using legal measures to compel communications providers to store the data themselves, and making it available for government to access, with then [[Home Secretary]] [[Jacqui Smith]] stating that "there are absolutely no plans for a single central store."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/news/legal-and-constitutional/home-office-rules-out-telephone-surveillance-database-$1291053.htm|title=Home Office rules out telephone surveillance database|publisher=politics.co.uk|author=Ian Dunt|date=27 Apr 2009|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new plans are thought to involve spending £2bn on paying [[Internet service provider|ISP]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s to install [[deep packet inspection]] equipment within their own networks, and obliging them to perform the cross-correlation and profiling of their users' behaviour themselves,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/27/imp_consultation/ UK.gov to spend £2bn on ISP tracking]&lt;/ref&gt; in effect achieving the original goals of the IMP by different means.

A detailed analysis was published by the Policy Engagement Network of the [[London School of Economics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/informationSystems/research/policyEngagement/IMP_Briefing.pdf LSE IMP Briefing]&lt;/ref&gt; on 16 June 2009.  The All Party Privacy Group held a hearing on IMP in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 1 July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://privacyappg.org.uk/Documents/imp_enquiry_agenda.pdf APPG IMP Hearing Agenda 1 July 2009]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK's new coalition government has apparently revived the IMP&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2010/10/programme-intercept-government A u-turn on reversing the surveillance state]&lt;/ref&gt; in their recent Strategic Defence and Security Review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Media-Room/News-Stories/2010/Strategic-Defence-and-Security-Review/ Strategic Defence and Security Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611153343/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/Media-Room/News-Stories/2010/Strategic-Defence-and-Security-Review/ |date=2011-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new version of the IMP is known as the [[Communications Capabilities Development Programme]].&lt;ref name=mitchell-2012-02-20&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/security/372985/anger-over-mass-web-surveillance-plans|title=Anger over mass web surveillance plans|author=Stewart Mitchell|publisher=PC Pro|date=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mechanical engineering, a '''kinematic chain''' is an assembly of [[Rigid body|rigid bodies]] connected by [[Joint (mechanics)|joints]] to provide constrained (or desired) motion that is the [[mathematical model]] for a [[mechanical system]].&lt;ref name=Reuleaux1876&gt;[[Franz Reuleaux|Reuleaux, F.]], 1876 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WUZVAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kinematics+of+machinery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qpn4Tse-E9SasgLcsZytDw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kinematics%20of%20machinery&amp;f=false ''The Kinematics of Machinery,''] (trans. and annotated by A. B. W. Kennedy), reprinted by Dover, New York (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the familiar use of the word [[chain]], the rigid bodies, or links, are constrained by their connections to other links.  An example is the simple open chain formed by links connected in series, like the usual chain, which is the [[kinematic]] model for a typical robot [[manipulator (device)|manipulator]].&lt;ref name="McCarthy2010"&gt;J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jv9mQyjRIw4C&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=geometric+design+of+linkages&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j6TS1043qE&amp;sig=R5ycw5DximWrQOEVshfiytflD6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0Zj4TuiCFvCGsgKyvO3FAQ&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=geometric%20design%20of%20linkages&amp;f=false ''Geometric Design of Linkages,''] Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical models of the connections, or joints, between two links are termed [[kinematic pair]]s.  Kinematic pairs model the hinged and sliding joints fundamental to [[robotics]], often called ''lower pairs'' and the surface contact joints critical to [[cam]]s and [[gear]]ing, called ''higher pairs.''  These joints are generally modeled as [[holonomic constraints]].  A [[kinematic diagram]] is a schematic of the mechanical system that shows the kinematic chain.

The modern use of kinematic chains includes compliance that arises from flexure joints in precision mechanisms, link compliance in [[compliant mechanism]]s and [[micro-electro-mechanical systems]], and cable compliance in cable robotic and [[tensegrity]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Larry L. Howell, 2001, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Compliant_mechanisms.html?id=tiiSOuhsIfgC Compliant mechanisms], John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Slocum, 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uG7aqgal65YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Precision Machine Design], SME&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobility formula ==
The [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], or ''mobility,'' of a kinematic chain is the number of parameters that define the configuration of the chain.&lt;ref name="McCarthy2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Uicker2003&gt;J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, '''Theory of Machines and Mechanisms,''' Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
A system of ''n'' rigid bodies moving in space has ''6n'' degrees of freedom measured relative to a fixed frame.   This frame is included in the count of bodies, so that mobility does not depend on link that forms the fixed frame.  This means the degree-of-freedom of this system is ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6(''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1), where ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is the number of moving bodies plus the fixed body.

Joints that connect bodies impose constraints.   Specifically, hinges and sliders each impose five constraints and therefore remove five degrees of freedom.  It is convenient to define the number of constraints ''c'' that a joint imposes in terms of the joint's freedom ''f'', where ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f''.  In the case of a hinge or slider, which are one degree of freedom joints, have ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and therefore ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5.

The result is that the mobility of a kinematic chain formed from ''n'' moving links and ''j'' joints each with freedom  ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''j,''  is given by

: &lt;math&gt; M = 6n - \sum_{i=1}^j (6 - f_i) =  6(N-1 - j) + \sum_{i=1}^j  f_i &lt;/math&gt;

Recall that ''N'' includes the fixed link.

==Analysis of kinematic chains==
The constraint equations of a kinematic chain couple the range of movement allowed at each joint to the dimensions of the links in the chain, and form [[algebraic equations]] that are solved to determine the configuration of the chain associated with specific values of input parameters, called [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]].

The constraint equations for a kinematic chain are obtained using [[rigid transformation]]s [Z] to characterize the relative movement allowed at each joint and separate rigid transformations [X] to define the dimensions of each link.   In the case of a serial open chain, the result is a sequence of rigid transformations alternating joint and link transformations from the base of the chain to its end link, which is equated to the specified position for the end link.   A chain of ''n'' links connected in series has the kinematic equations,

: &lt;math&gt;[T] = [Z_1][X_1][Z_2][X_2]\cdots[X_{n-1}][Z_n],\!&lt;/math&gt;

where [''T''] is the transformation locating the end-link—notice that the chain includes a "zeroth" link consisting of the ground frame to which it is attached. These equations are called the [[forward kinematics]] equations of the serial chain.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. McCarthy, 1990, ''Introduction to Theoretical Kinematics,'' MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinematic chains of a wide range of complexity are analyzed by equating the kinematics equations of serial chains that form loops within the kinematic chain.  These equations are often called ''loop equations''.

The complexity (in terms of calculating the [[forward kinematics|forward]] and [[inverse kinematics]]) of the chain is determined by the following factors:
* Its [[topology]]: a serial chain, a [[parallel manipulator]], a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] structure, or a [[graph theory|graph]].
* Its [[Euclidean geometry|geometrical]] form: how are neighbouring [[kinematic pair|joints]] spatially connected to each other?

'''Explanation'''

Two or more rigid bodies in space are collectively called a rigid body system. We can hinder the motion of these independent rigid bodies with kinematic constraints. Kinematic constraints are constraints between rigid bodies that result in the decrease of the degrees of freedom of rigid body system.&lt;ref name="Uicker2003"/&gt;

==Synthesis of kinematic chains==
The constraint equations of a kinematic chain can be used in reverse to determine the dimensions of the links from a specification of the desired movement of the system.  This is termed ''kinematic synthesis.''&lt;ref name="Hartenberg1964"&gt;R. S. Hartenberg and J. Denavit, 1964, ''Kinematic Synthesis of Linkages,'' McGraw-Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most developed formulation of kinematic synthesis is for [[four-bar linkage]]s, which is known as [[Burmester theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Suh, C. H., and Radcliffe, C. W., '''Kinematics and Mechanism Design,''' John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandor,G.N.,andErdman,A.G.,1984,AdvancedMechanismDesign:AnalysisandSynthesis, Vol. 2. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, K. H., '''Kinematic Geometry of Mechanisms,''' Oxford Engineering Science Series, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ferdinand Freudenstein]] is often called the father of modern kinematics for his contributions to the kinematic synthesis of [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkages]] beginning in the 1950s.  His use of the newly developed computer to solve ''Freudenstein's equation'' became the prototype of [[computer-aided design]] systems.&lt;ref name="Hartenberg1964"/&gt;

This work has been generalized to the synthesis of spherical and spatial mechanisms.&lt;ref name="McCarthy2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1415">In mathematics, a '''Kline sphere characterization,''' named after [[John Robert Kline]], is a [[topology|topological]] characterization of a two-dimensional [[sphere]] in terms of what sort of subset separates it.  Its proof was one of the first notable accomplishments of [[R. H. Bing]];  Bing gave an alternate proof using [[brick partitioning]] in his paper ''Complementary domains of continuous curves'' &lt;ref name="cdcc"&gt;Bing, R.H., Complementary domains of continuous curves, ''Fund. Math.'' '''36''' (1949), [http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm36/fm36131.pdf 303-318].&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Curve|simple closed curve]] in a two-dimensional sphere (for instance, its equator) [[Connected space|separates]] the sphere into two pieces upon removal.  If one removes a pair of points from a sphere, however, the remainder is [[Connected space|connected]].  Kline's sphere characterization states that the converse is true:  If a nondegenerate [[Locally connected space|locally connected]] [[metric space|metric]] [[continuum (topology)|continuum]] is separated by any simple closed curve but by no pair of points, then it is a two-dimensional sphere.

The '''Manú Learning Centre''' ('''MLC''') is located within the [[Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]], a 643 hectare private [[nature reserve]], encompassed within the cultural zone of the [[Manú National Park|Manú Biosphere Reserve]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]] and one of the largest protected areas in [[Peru]]. It is home to a variety of [[tropical rainforest|rainforest types]] including lowland Andean, pre-montane, bamboo and high terrace forests. This geographical complexity creates habitats for a diversity of [[Rainforest#Flora and fauna|flora and fauna]].  The MLC is operated by the [[#CREES|CREES]] group, a non-profit and business collaboration working towards sustainability for the Manú Region.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/pdf/Manu.pdf | title = Manu National Park | accessdate = 2009-03-19 | last = UNEP | first = | date = 2008-09-20 | format = PDF | publisher = http://www.unep-wcmc.org | pages = 1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLC serves local schools and communities as well as international researchers and [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.  It has hosted workshops for the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]], and on behalf of the Manú National Park Guards, as well as research projects from the [[University of Oxford]], [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]], and [[Glasgow University]] in addition to the [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]].  The MLC has also worked alongside schools from the UK including [[Southbank International School]] and [[Tonbridge School]].

==History==
The MLC was built in 2004 on an abandoned [[hacienda]], the first to be developed in the region.  The initial concept was to demonstrate that it was possible to use novel land use techniques to rehabilitate large areas of degraded land and to empower and educate local communities throughout this process.  There is a large body of work that had been completed at the MLC incorporating aspects of [[biology]], [[geography]], [[zoology]], [[anthropology]], [[tropical agriculture]], [[politics]], and [[art]]. Specific projects have focused on [[reforestation]], mammal behaviour patterns, [[ecological footprint|human impact studies]], environmental management, monitoring of the [[blue headed macaw]] ([[CITES|CITES Red listed]]), [[Agricultural soil science#Soil Preservation|soil &amp; agricultural sustainability]], [[forest dynamics]], carbon offsetting, and the legitimacy of local power structures to name a handful.

==CREES==
CREES (Conservation, Research &amp; Education towards Environmental Sustainability) was established in 2003 prior to the construction of the MLC and the creation of Fundo Mascoitania. It is the only organisation to be in operation within the Manú region of Peru who regularly consults with local populations about their development priorities and leads the consequential local development projects.

==Access==
[[Image:Alto Madre from MLC.jpg|thumb|300px|The Alto Madre de Dios River from the Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]]The MLC is accessible from [[Cusco]] by road until Atalaya and then by [[Launch(boat)|lancha]] until the port at the MLC.  During the [[dry season]] boats may not be able to navigate the river from Atalaya in which case transport is needed up until the Aguanos settlement on the opposite side of the [[Madre de Dios River|Alto Madre de Dios River]].  Crossing is then possible by raft or by lancha.

==Biodiversity and wildlife==
[[Image:Tropical Tree frog MLC.JPG|thumb|300px|Frog found in Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]]

'''[[Clay lick#Clay licks|Macaw Collpa]]'''

The MLC reserve attracts an array of parrots and macaws thanks to the spectacular clay mineral lick, or [[Clay lick#Clay licks|Collpa]] carved out by the Alto Madre de Dios river. This collpa is the only one of its type in the zone, and is visited daily by hundreds of colourful and noisy parrots and macaws, the most notable of these being the Blue Headed Macaw. These in turn draw raptors such as the ornate hawk eagle and crested eagle.

'''Mammal Collpa'''

The MLC boasts two large mammal collpas which attracts smaller mammals as well as large groups of white-lipped peccary and their natural Jaguar predators.

'''Wildlife Monitoring Array'''

The MLC's wildlife monitoring array was established in 2005. The array comprises a 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; monitoring grid mapped using GPS.  It provides a quantified area in which researchers can complete research on plants, animals and birds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12207">The '''myth of superabundance''' is the belief that [[earth]] has more than sufficient [[natural resources]] to satisfy humanity's needs, and that no matter how much of these resources humanity uses, the planet will continuously replenish the supply.  Although the idea had existed previously among [[conservation movement|conservationist]]s in the 19th century, it was not given a name until [[Stewart Udall]]'s 1964 book ''The Quiet Crisis''.

Udall describes the myth as the belief that there was "so much land, so much water, so much timber, so many birds and beasts"&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|22}} that man did not envision a time where the planet would not replenish what had been sowed. The myth of superabundance began to circulate during [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s presidency at the beginning of the nineteenth century and persuaded many Americans to exploit natural resources as they pleased with no thought of long-term consequences.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; According to historian of the North American west [[George Colpitts]], "No theme became as integral to western promotion as natural abundance."&lt;ref name=Colpitts/&gt;{{rp|104}} Especially with respect to the west after 1890, promotional literature encouraged migration by invoking the idea that God had provided an abundant environment there such that no man or family would fail if they sought to farm or otherwise live off the land out west.&lt;ref name=Colpitts/&gt; Since at that time environmental science and the study of ecology barely allowed for the possibility of animal [[extinction]] and did not provide tools for measuring biomass or the limits of natural resources, many speculators, settlers, and other parties participated in unsustainable practices that led to various extinctions, the [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon, and other [[environmental catastrophe]]s.

== Early manifestations ==
In 1784, [[John Filson]] wrote ''The Discovery, Settlement And present State of [[Kentucky|Kentucke]]'',&lt;ref name=Filson/&gt; which included the chapter "The Adventures of Colonel [[Daniel Boone|Daniel Boon]]".  This work represents one of the earliest instance of the myth of superabundance, acting as something of a promotional ad enticing settlers to Kentucky based on the abundance of resources to be found there.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;

== Warning signs ==
Udall describes many large-scale impacts on natural resources, terming them "The Big Raid on resources".&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|54}} The first was the need for [[logging|lumber]] in a growing nation for [[fuel]], [[housing]] and [[paper]]. Udall states that it was with this first big raid on the earth’s natural resources that the myth of superabundance began to show its fallacy. It was only towards the end of the nineteenth century that people were awakened to the empty hillsides and the vastness of blackened woods from the [[lumber industry]]. [[Petroleum]] followed, as it was widely believed that oil was constantly made inside the earth, and so, like everything else, was inexhaustible. Then came [[seal hunting]], and by 1866 the seal population that originally numbered approximately five million was drastically cut in half.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; Many of the seals were shot in the water and never recovered, allowing for enormous waste. The [[Fur Seal Treaty]] which came about in 1911 saved the seals from becoming the first major marine species to become extinct thanks to the myth of superabundance.

The [[passenger pigeon]] was the largest wildlife species known to humanity in the early nineteenth century, when the bird's population was estimated at about five billion.  By the early 20th century, due to [[overhunting]] and habitat destruction brought about by the timber industry, the species had become extinct, the last passenger pigeon having died in the Cincinnati Zoo.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; The passenger pigeon became extinct in under a century and was just one of the many victims of the myth of superabundance.{{synthesis inline|date=November 2016}}

Likewise, the [[American bison|American buffalo]] was threatened by the myth of superabundance. They were considered to be the largest and most valuable resource because just about every piece of them was usable. The big kill of the buffalo began at the end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when armies wanted the animals killed in order to starve out the [[Plains Indians]]. Railroad men wanted them killed in order to supply heavier and profitable loads of hides. Buffalo were killed for their tongues and hides, and some hunters simply wanted them as trophies. Pleas of protection for the buffalo were ignored, nearly wiping out the species.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;

The [[Great Leap Forward]] in [[China]] in 1958 corresponded closely with the myth of superabundance;{{synthesis inline|date=November 2016}} economic planners reduced the acreage space for planting wheat and grains, trying to force farmers and agricultural labourers into accepting new forms of [[industry]]. As a result, production of wheat and grain was slowed dangerously, and floods in [[Southern China|the South]] and droughts in the North struck in 1959, leading China into the record-breaking [[Great Chinese Famine]].&lt;ref name=Mokyr/&gt;

== The myth exposed ==
[[George Perkins Marsh]], who wrote ''[[Man and Nature]]'' in 1864, rejected the idea that any resource could be exploited without any concerns for the future. Perkins was a witness to natural destruction; he saw that mistakes of the past were destroying the present prosperity. He believed that nature should be second nature to all and should not be used as an exploitation for economics and politics. He was, after all, "forest born".&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|72}} Man's role as a catalyst of change in the natural world intrigued him. He believed that progress was entirely possible and necessary, if only men used wisdom in the management of resources. He deflated, but did not destroy the myth of superabundance. He began the spin into doubt,&lt;ref name=Marsh/&gt; which made way for [[John Muir]] in 1874. Muir, who had grown up surrounded by wilderness, believed that wildlife and nature could provide people with heightened sense abilities and experiences of awe that could be found nowhere else.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; Entering into civilization with a desire to see preservation of some of what he believed to be America’s most beautiful nature, he built upon steps that had been taken by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], a young landscape architect who designed [[Central Park]] in [[New York City]]. Olmsted had persuaded [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass a bill preserving much of [[Yosemite Valley]], which [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] had then approved in 1864. In 1872 [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] signed the Yellowstone Park bill, saving over two million acres of wildlife.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;

== Early successes ==
Muir saw [[overgrazing]] destruction in Yosemite, in parts of it that were not under protection. It was a result of nearby [[Sheep husbandry|sheepmen]] and their herds.&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;Overgrazing would later spark a feud of conflicting beliefs between Muir and Glifford Pinchot, the Department of Agriculture’s Chief Forester, who were actually friends. They clashed over sheep-grazing practices, because Pinchot believed that controlled grazing was useful in the forest preserves, but Muir believed that it was a bad practice to use at all. Pinchot is known to have later rescinded his argument, saying that Muir was indeed, right.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, Muir wrote an article "God’s First Temples – How Shall We Preserve Our Forests", which he published in the newspaper, pleading for help with protection of the forests. At first he failed against the overriding ideal of the myth of superabundance, but he did inspire bills in the 1880s that sought to enlarge Yosemite’s reservation. Muir formed the [[Sierra Club]], a group of mountaineers and conservationists like him who had responded to his many articles. The Sierra Club’s first big fight came as a counter-attack on lumbermen and [[Cowboy|stockmen]] who wanted to monopolize some of Yosemite County. Yosemite Valley, which was still owned by the state, was mismanaged and natural reserves like the meadows and Mirror Lake, which was dammed for irrigation, were still being destroyed even under supposed protection.  In 1895, Muir and the Sierra Club began a battle that would span over ten years, fighting for natural management of Yosemite Valley. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] met with Muir in 1903 and was instantly fascinated with Muir’s passion for the wilderness. Roosevelt approved Muir’s argument for Yosemite Valley, and so the Sierra Club took their decade long campaign to Sacramento, where they finally won against California legislature in 1905. With Roosevelt on Muir’s side, Yosemite Valley finally became part of the Yosemite National Park and was allowed natural management.

== Moving backwards ==
Udall asserts that the myth of superabundance, once exposed, was replaced in the 20th century by the ''myth of scientific supremacy'': the belief that science can eventually find a solution to any problem.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|178}}  This leads to behaviors which, while recognizing that resources are not infinite, still fail to properly preserve those resources, putting the problem off to future generations to solve through science.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt; "Present the repair bill to the next generation" is their silent motto.&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|178}} George Perkins Marsh had said that conservation's greatest enemies were "greed and shortsightedness".&lt;ref name=Udall/&gt;{{rp|178}} Men reach a power trip thinking they can manipulate nature the way that they want.

== Next steps ==
In order for man to live harmoniously with nature, as Muir and Perkins and many others have fought for, Patsy Hallen in the article, "The Art of Impurity" says that an ethics development must occur in which respect for nature and our radical dependency on it can take place. Humans see themselves as superior to nature, and yet we are in a constant state of continuity with it. Hallen argues that humanity cannot afford such an irrational state of mind and ecological denial if it expects to prosper in the future.&lt;ref name=Hallen/&gt;

{{Update|date=September 2014}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}
On April 10, 2007, the [[National Football League]] introduced a new '''conduct policy''' to help control off-field behavior by its players and preserve the league's public image.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"&gt;[[Associated Press]]. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-04-10-new-conduct-policy_N.htm?csp=34 Goodell strengthens NFL player conduct policy] ''USA Today'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy, introduced by NFL commissioner [[Roger Goodell]], implements a tougher, new personal-conduct policy, and under conditions of the previous policy handed down two of the harshest suspensions in NFL history for off-field misdeeds.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"&gt;Bell, Jarrett. [https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2007-04-10-pacman-henry-suspensions_N.htm Conduct unbecoming: NFL sets new standard with suspensions] ''USA Today'', April 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Each player that has been suspended must reapply for reinstatement.&lt;ref name="CB Jones suspended"&gt;[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=playerconduct&amp;prov=st&amp;type=lgns CB Jones suspended for 2007 season, WR Henry banned eight games] ''Yahoo Sports Ticker'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy only applies to the player's personal lives and image in the public spotlight. The NFL conducts separate investigations for drug and alcohol abuse and performance enhancement.

As of December 2011, seven players have been suspended for an extended period by the NFL due to conduct off the field.

| style="text-align: left;" | "It is important that the NFL be represented consistently by outstanding people as well as great football players, coaches, and staff. We hold ourselves to higher standards of responsible conduct because of what it means to be part of the National Football League. We have long had policies and programs designed to encourage responsible behavior, and this policy is a further step in ensuring that everyone who is part of the NFL meets that standard. We will continue to review the policy and modify it as warranted."

On September 1, 2006, just days prior to the start of the [[2006 NFL season]], [[Roger Goodell]] assumed the office of Commissioner of the National Football League. Goodell was met with expectations of enforcing the National Football League's image to the media. In the months leading up to Goodell's ascension, nine players from the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] had been arrested.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"&gt;Wilner, Barry. (Associated Press) [http://www.boston.com/sports/football/articles/2007/04/10/goodell_gets_tough_protects_nfl_brand/?rss_id=Boston.com+%2F+Sports+%2F+Football+%2F+New+England+Patriots Goodell gets tough, protects NFL brand] ''Boston Globe'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodell and the [[National Football League Players Association]] decided that teams will be responsible for the conduct of their employees, and will be subject to discipline for any transgressions.

Goodell had consulted with [[Gene Upshaw]], former executive director of the NFLPA, and also created a six-man player advisory committee to discuss conduct, discipline and other topics.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"/&gt;

The first (players) to feel the teeth of the new policy were [[Tennessee Titans]] [[cornerback]] [[Pacman Jones|Adam "Pacman" Jones]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]] [[wide receiver]] [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]], college teammates at [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]] whose first two years in the NFL were marred by arrests.&lt;ref name="CB Jones suspended"/&gt; The third player suspended was [[Chicago Bears]] [[defensive tackle]] [[Tank Johnson]]. On August 24, 2007, [[Atlanta Falcons]] starting [[quarterback]] [[Michael Vick]] filed a [[plea agreement]] and pleaded guilty in his involvement in illegal dog fighting and [[euthanasia|euthanization]], and was suspended indefinitely without pay; his reinstatement occurred in time for him to play in the 2009-2010 season.

==Suspended players==

===Adam "Pacman" Jones===
{{details|Adam Jones (American football)#Las Vegas shooting case and suspension}}
Tennessee Titans cornerback Adam "Pacman" Jones, facing felony charges in two states, was suspended for the entire 2007 season and given specific conditions to meet before he is reinstated, and he can be reinstated after the Titans' eleventh game.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt; There were 10 occasions in which Jones was interviewed by police, the most recent during the [[2007 NBA All-Star Game|NBA All-Star weekend]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Police there recommended felony and misdemeanor charges against Jones after a fight and shooting at, what Jones refers to as a "strip club", left one man paralyzed.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Jones later appealed his suspension,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/10119161 NFL Suspends Pacman Jones, Bengals' Henry] ''NFL.com'', April 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; saying he was "just being rebellious", but withdrew the request just weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/football/nfl/06/12/bc.fbn.pacmansuspension.ap/index.html Pacman Jones drops appeal], ''Sports Illustrated'', June 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 20, 2007, the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department]] and [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] District Attorney's office announced that Jones will face two felony charges stemming from the strip club melee that occurred on February 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2910497 Pacman faces felony charges in shooting that paralyzed man] ''ESPN.com'', June 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While the charges have since been dropped, Jones still faces civil actions, and his reinstatement was not to be considered until after the [[2008 Pro Bowl]]. On June 2, 2008, NFL Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] cleared Jones to participate in preseason workouts for the [[Dallas Cowboys]], who had traded for him during his suspension, and also said that a decision on Jones' reinstatement for the regular season would be made by September 1, six days before the Cowboys' first 2008 regular-season game. The league announced at that time that Jones' full reinstatement would depend on "demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=nfl&amp;id=3422983 |title='Pacman' can join Cowboys for workouts |author=Associated Press |work=ESPN.com |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 26 Jones found himself fully reinstated, only to be suspended indefinitely on October 14 after an altercation with his bodyguard in a Dallas hotel.

===Chris Henry===
{{details|topic=Chris Henry's legal troubles|Chris Henry (wide receiver)}}
Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry, arrested five times in three states between December 2005 and April 2008,&lt;ref name="Bengals cut Henry"&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3327235 Bengals cut Henry, say they'll no longer tolerate his conduct] ''ESPN.com'', April 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; was suspended for the first eight games of the 2007 season.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt; He also had to comply with several conditions before returning.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt; Henry was arrested four times in a 14-month span, and received a two-game league suspension last year.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; He was one of nine Bengals arrested in nine months.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Henry was required to not get into further trouble with the law and had to cooperate fully with required counseling, education and treatment assigned to him under league programs.&lt;ref name="CB Jones suspended"/&gt;

Henry returned for the second half of the 2007 season but played a minor role on an 7-9 Bengals team. In April 2008, the Bengals released Henry after he was charged with misdemeanor and criminal damaging. He was accused of punching an 18-year-old male in the face and breaking a window in the individual's car. A warrant for Henry's arrest was issued and he surrendered the following day, a police spokesman said.&lt;ref name="Bengals cut Henry"/&gt; In August 2008, the Bengals re-signed Henry. On December 17, 2009, Henry died from injuries sustained from an accident stemming from a [[domestic dispute]] between him and his fiancee.

===Tank Johnson===
{{details|topic=Terry Johnson's legal troubles|Tank Johnson}}
On April 30, Terry "Tank" Johnson pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge as part of an arrangement with prosecutors that will keep him from serving additional jail time. He was sentenced to 45 days in jail, which was served concurrently with a four-month sentence he was already serving in the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Jail for violating his probation; to donate $2,500 to the [[Gurnee, Illinois]] Police Department and $2,500 to the Gurnee Exchange Club's [[child abuse]] prevention program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs2chicago.com/local/local_story_120134804.html Tank Johnson Pleads Guilty, Avoids More Jail Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513214729/http://cbs2chicago.com/local/local_story_120134804.html |date=May 13, 2007 }} CBS2 Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Tank-mug.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson's 2007 [[mugshot]] after his arrest.]] --&gt;
Johnson's release from jail on May 13 ended his legal problems from the December 2006 weapons incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_131133238.html Bears' Tank Johnson To Be Released Sunday] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927231943/http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_131133238.html |date=September 27, 2007 }} CBS2 Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The league ultimately suspended Johnson for half of the regular season on June 4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagobears.com/news/NewsStory.asp?story_id=3492 NFL announces Tank Johnson suspension] ''ChicagoBears.com'' June 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he will have the opportunity to reduce the sentence to six games if he complies with Commissioner Goodell's guidelines of behavior, which include going to counseling.

On June 22, Johnson was pulled over [[speeding]] in [[Arizona]]. According to the police, he was stopped by the police after traveling at forty miles per hour in a twenty-five-mile per hour zone. He was later suspected of drinking, but was released without being booked or charged.

On June 25, 2007, Johnson was released from his contract by the Chicago Bears as a result of the June 22 incident. Bears [[General manager]] [[Jerry Angelo]] stated that he had "no room for error left." The results of Johnson's blood tests were still pending when the Bears made their decision.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AnMbdkdrIUiC5zLiX_yS6dJDubYF?slug=ap-tankjohnson-trafficstop&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns Tank Johnson stopped by police in Phoenix suburb] ''[[Yahoo!]] Sports'', June 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2916083 Bears waive suspended Tank Johnson] ''ESPN.com'', June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, it was announced that Johnson was under the [[blood alcohol content|legal limit]] and will not be charged with [[driving under the influence]].

On September 18, 2007, Johnson agreed to terms of a two-year contract with the [[Dallas Cowboys]], but was unable to contact the team until week 9 of the [[2007 NFL season]].

===Michael Vick===
{{details|topic=Michael Vick's involvement in dog fighting|Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation}}

Beginning on April 25, 2007, a large house and surrounding {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property Michael Vick owned in rural [[Surry County, Virginia]] where his 26-year-old cousin Davon T. Boddie had been residing became part of a continuing police investigation for possible operation of an illegal [[dog fighting]] ring. The action came after police executed a [[search warrant]] following two narcotics arrests of Boddie within a week in the [[Virginia Peninsula]] cities of Newport News and [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] (each about {{convert|20|mi|km}} away from the Surry County property) earlier in April. Boddie had given the address of Vick's property in Surry County as his home address when arrested. Earlier, in February 2007, Boddie was convicted in the [[Norfolk, Virginia|City of Norfolk]] of disorderly conduct. At that time, he was carrying a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] driver's license giving his address as a house in [[Duluth, Georgia]] which was once owned by Vick.&lt;ref name="Involvement"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Greg Moore |title=If Vick Is Involved, How Many Others Are With Him? |publisher=BlackAthlete Sports Network |date=May 30, 2007 |url=http://www.blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Football_7/If_Vick_Is_Involved_How_Many_Others_Are_With_Him.shtml |accessdate=July 7, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603140222/http://blackathlete.net/artman2/publish/Football_7/If_Vick_Is_Involved_How_Many_Others_Are_With_Him.shtml |archivedate=June 3, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[ESPN]], during the April 25 narcotics-related search of Vick's home and property at 1915 Moonlight Drive in the southeastern portion of Surry County, police discovered a large number of animals, and evidence which they felt indicated dog fighting.&lt;ref name="Progressing"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Associated Press |title=Prosecutor says dog fighting investigation at Vick's property 'moving forward' |publisher=ESPN |date=May 25, 2007 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2883048 |accessdate=May 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They called animal-control officers, who saw what they said was evidence that dogfights had taken place there. Police obtained another search warrant,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Bill Geroux |title=Dogfighting: The Vick case |publisher=inRich |date=July 3, 2007 |url=http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-03-0114.html |accessdate=July 5, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003537/http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-03-0114.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with the help of animal control officials from several localities, removed 66 dogs, 55 of them [[pit bull]]s, and seized equipment and some physical evidence that could be associated with dog fighting.&lt;ref name="Progressing"/&gt; [[WAVY-TV]] reported that detectives also seized guns, illegal ammunition magazines, suspected marijuana and paperwork on dog fighting.&lt;ref name="No Knowledge"&gt;{{Cite web|title=UPDATE - Vick claims no knowledge of situation on his property |publisher=WAVY-TV |date=March 28, 2007 |url=http://www.wavy.com/Global/story.asp?S=6428206 |accessdate=July 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vick, along with three others, was indicted by a federal grand jury on July 17, 2007 for "conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in animal fighting venture".&lt;ref name="indictmentespn"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2940065|title=Falcons' Vick indicted by grand jury in dogfighting probe|date=July 17, 2007|accessdate=July 7, 2007|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/17/sportsline/main3067633.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Michael Vick Indicted By Grand Jury | date=July 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 18-page federal indictment&lt;ref name="Federal Indictment"&gt;{{Cite web|author=The Smoking Gun |title=Sources: Vick and three others indicted in feds dogfighting investigation |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=July 17, 2007 |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0717072vick1.html |accessdate=July 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; outlines an extensive operation which included not only unlawful fighting, but violence against dogs which did not perform well including executions by electrocution, hanging, and shooting, as well as involving tens of thousands of dollars in [[gambling]] activity. The four face $350,000 in fines and six years in prison if convicted of the federal charges. The operation was based at Vick's {{convert|15|acre|m2|adj=on}} property near [[Smithfield, Virginia]], valued at over $700,000, which could conceivably be forfeited to the government, as the indictment also puts them on notice that the government intends to take possession of property used in the illegal operations and any proceeds.

In late April 2007, Vick denied his involvement and told ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' "I'm never at the house...I left the house with my family...They just haven't been doing the right thing... It's unfortunate I have to take the heat behind it. If I'm not there, I don't know what's going on."&lt;ref name="No Knowledge"/&gt;

Vick appeared in court on July 26, 2007 and pleaded [[innocence|not guilty]], the same date that the Atlanta Falcons began [[NFL Training Camp|training camp]].&lt;ref name="Vick indicted"&gt;Weir, Tom.

Vick was suspended without pay "indefinitely" by the National Football League on August 24.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.aol.com/sports/story/_a/nfl-suspends-michael-vick-indefinitely/20070824131409990001?ncid=NWS00010000000001 NFL suspends Vick indefinitely] ''AOL.com'', August 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 13, 2009, Vick signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was placed on the exempt/commissioner's permission list on September 5, 2009. On September 15, 2009, Vick was activated to the 53-man roster.

===Ben Roethlisberger===
{{details|Ben Roethlisberger#Milledgeville, Georgia}}
On July 17, 2009, a civil suit was filed in Washoe County, Nevada District Court accusing [[Ben Roethlisberger]] of sexually assaulting Andrea McNulty, 31, in June 2008 in his hotel room while he was in Lake Tahoe for a celebrity golf tournament. No charges were filed in the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger’s civil sexual assault lawsuit settled|url=https://nypost.com/2012/01/21/steelers-qb-ben-roethlisbergers-civil-sexual-assault-lawsuit-settled/|website=Ny Post|publisher=New York Post|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 5, 2010, it was revealed that a woman from [[Milledgeville, Georgia]] had accused Roethlisberger of sexual assault. While Roethlisberger was once again not charged with a crime following the events at the nightclub,&lt;ref name=DAtranscript&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalsportsreview.com/sports/us/d-wil/2010/04/12/da-fred-bright-transcript-plus-the-post-statement-interview/|title=D.A.

This was the first time in league history a player has been suspended under the personal conduct policy without being charged with a crime.  Roethlisberger and Ezekiel Elliott are the only two players to have been suspended under this policy without being charged with a crime.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

===Ray Rice===
On February 15, 2014, [[Ray Rice]] and his fiancée Janay Palmer were arrested and charged with assault after a physical altercation at [[Revel Atlantic City|Revel Casino]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]].

On June 18, 2013, [[Aaron Hernandez]]'s house in [[North Attleboro, Massachusetts|North Attleboro]] was searched by police for several hours in connection with an investigation into the shooting death of a friend, Odin Lloyd.

On April 15, 2015, Hernandez was found guilty of first-degree murder, as well as five weapon charges, automatically being sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.

While on trial for Lloyd's murder, Hernandez was indicted for the 2012 double homicide of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado; he was acquitted of the double homicide after a 2017 trial. Five days after the acquittal, Hernandez was found dead in his cell by hanging, which was ruled a suicide. Due to the fact that his death occurred while the murder conviction was under appeal, the conviction was vacated.·§

On Wednesday September 17, 2014 [[Jonathan Dwyer]] was arrested because of two incidents at Dwyer's home in southeast Phoenix on July 21 at 8 a.m. and July 22 at 4 p.m., according to the Phoenix Police Department.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11544985/jonathan-dwyer-arizona-cardinals-arrested-two-counts-suspicion-aggravated-assault&lt;/ref&gt; The incidents concerned attacks against his wife and 18-month-old child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arizona Cardinals player formally charged in domestic violence case|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/29/justice/jonathan-dwyer-indictment/|website=CNN Justice|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwyer was booked into Maricopa County Jail on one count of aggravated assault causing a fracture, one count of aggravated assault involving a minor, two counts of criminal damage, one count of preventing the use of a phone in an emergency, and assault. He was freed the next morning on a $25,000 cash bond and ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device. He was also banned from any contact with the alleged victims, travels outside of Arizona and any involvement with weapons, drugs or alcohol.

Dwyer admitted to the incidents during interviews with detectives but denied physically assaulting his wife and baby son.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/17/us/nfl-jonathan-dwyer-alleged-domestic-violence/&lt;/ref&gt; According to police, a search warrant was executed at his home.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11547511/police-report-says-jonathan-dwyer-arizona-cardinals-head-butted-punched-wife-struck-young-son-shoe&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martavis Bryant===
Before the start of the [[2015 NFL season]], [[Martavis Bryant]] was suspended for four games in August for violating the league's substance abuse policy. He would return and play the rest of the season with the [[2015 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Steelers]]. During the suspension, he spent time in rehab in [[Houston, TX|Houston]]. Bryant was charged with violating the substance abuse policy again, and suspended, this time for the entire [[2016 NFL season]].

===Ezekiel Elliott===
On August 11, 2017, the NFL suspended [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[running back]] [[Ezekiel Elliott]] for the first six games of the 2017 season, despite the lead NFL investigator in the case reportedly recommending no suspension. His suspension stems from various off the field incidents including being accused of [[domestic violence]] in 2016 by his ex-girlfriend who claimed on five different occasions he assaulted her. Despite never being charged, the NFL launched a year long investigation into the allegations. In March 2017, Elliott was captured on video pulling down woman's shirt exposing her breasts while watching a [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade in Dallas. Four months later in July 2017 he was allegedly involved in an altercation at a nightclub during which a DJ’s nose was broken. Dallas police eventually suspended the investigation after they were unable to locate the victim. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20302469/ezekiel-elliott-dallas-cowboys-suspended-six-games|title=Cowboys' Ezekiel Elliott suspended six games for conduct|last=Archer|first=Todd|publisher=''ESPN.com''|date=11 August 2017|accessdate=11 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFL Domestic Violence Policy==
A Domestic Violence Policy has been put into effect after the Ray Rice domestic violence incident on August 28, 2014. Commissioner Roger Goodell has lengthen bans to six games for the first domestic violence incident and a lifetime ban for a second incident. This is after the NFL suspended Ray Rice for two games and receiving large amounts of criticism during the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Almasy|first1=Steve|last2=Nichols|first2=Rachel|title=NFL toughens domestic violence policy with six-game bans|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/28/us/nfl-domestic-violence/|website=CNN.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL has a history of inconsistently punishing domestic violence amongst its players. A majority of domestic violence violations are punished with about a 1.5 game suspension. The NFL rather has a consistent policy for punishing drug violations with performance-enhancing drugs and substance abuses averaging about 4 games suspension for the first offense and about 8 games suspension of performance-enhancing drugs and a 16 games suspension for substance abuse for a second offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCann|first1=Allison|title=The NFL’s Uneven History Of Punishing Domestic Violence|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nfl-domestic-violence-policy-suspensions/|website=fivethirtyeight.com|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NFL has released a new Personal Conduct Policy on December 10, 2014. It is an updated version of the 2007 Personal Conduct Policy. It has added more infractions to the 2007 policy, which include violence against others and domestic violence. The disciplinary process is more detailed in terms of its investigative progress and consequences for infractions than its 2007 counterpart.

==Public response==

===Praise===
The new policy has been praised by both NFL players and sports columnists as a necessity to help improve the National Football League's image. The new policy—which also applies to coaches and front office personnel and has the support of NFLPA director Gene Upshaw—prompted questions and strong reactions among players.&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt;
Teammates of Chris Henry, including safety Madieu Williams, approved of the measure.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"/&gt;

[[Oakland Raiders]] defensive tackle [[Warren Sapp]] stated, "I understand what they're doing. Some of these new-jack kids act like they're walking on water. Sometimes, they need to be slapped in the face to wake up."&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt;

[[New England Patriots]] owner [[Robert Kraft]] said of the policy, "I hope this sends a message to people in our league for how to conduct themselves. We have to be careful. People in America can't relate to overindulged athletes not acting responsibly."&lt;ref name="Conduct unbecoming"/&gt;

===Criticism===
{{cquote|''I hope it doesn't backfire. What happens if a coach, GM or owner gets a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]]? Then what? What if an ex-NFL player throws himself through a window in [[Miami]]? That still reflects on the NFL's image.''&lt;br&gt;- [[Keyshawn Johnson]], former NFL wide receiver, and current NFL broadcaster.}}

Many considered the suspensions on Jones and Henry to be too harsh, especially Jones', which was enforced despite Jones having not been convicted of any crime. {{Who|date=December 2009}} Criticism was also drawn at the commissioner's ability to punish the rest of the player's team and revoke draft picks.&lt;ref name="Goodell strengthens"/&gt; Goodell's actions are also leaving the league vulnerable to legal action from player's lawyers.&lt;ref name="Goodell gets tough"/&gt;

When New England Patriots head coach [[Bill Belichick]] and his staff were [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|accused of illegally videotaping]] the [[New York Jets]]' defensive playcalling signals in September 2007, Belichick was not suspended, but instead fined $500,000. The team was penalized a [[2008 NFL Draft|first round draft pick in 2008]] as they qualified for the playoffs with a perfect 16–0 record, but would have been penalized with a second and third round pick had they failed to make the playoffs. (The Patriots still ended up with the [[New Orleans Saints]]' first-round pick in a trade, selecting [[Jerod Mayo]] with the pick.) The move was heavily criticized as being a [[double standard]].&lt;ref name="impression"/&gt; Although the videotaping is not considered to violate personal conduct rules, NFL players, including [[Cincinnati Bengals]] quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] were critical of Commissioner Goodell's move.&lt;ref name="impression"&gt;Covitz, Randy. [http://www.kansascity.com/sports/story/281362.html NFL gives impression of double standard with Belichick treatment] ''Kansas City Star'', September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When Goodell penalized Belichick, he determined that the use of the camera during the Patriots’ season-opening 38-14 win over the New York Jets had no impact on the game.&lt;ref name="impression" /&gt;

[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]], often considered a founder of the nonviolence movement, spread the concept of [[ahimsa]] through his movements and writings, which then inspired other nonviolent activists.]]

'''Nonviolence'''&lt;!-- Don't put back the ridiculous claim back that the English word comes from Sanskrit; it's not even a calque or loan translation. The influence of Indian philosophy on the West is denigrated by such unencyclopedic nonsense.--&gt; is the personal practice of being harmless to self and others under every condition.  It comes from the belief that hurting people, animals or the environment is unnecessary to achieve an outcome and refers to a general philosophy of abstention from violence. This may be based on moral, religious or spiritual principles, or it may be for purely strategic or pragmatic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;A clarification of this and related terms appears in [[Gene Sharp]], ''Sharp's Dictionary of Power and Struggle: Language of Civil Resistance in Conflicts'', Oxford University Press, New York, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence also has 'active' or 'activist' elements, in that believers generally accept the need for nonviolence as a means to achieve political and [[social change]]. Thus, for example, the Tolstoy and Gandhian non violence is a philosophy and strategy for social change that rejects the use of [[violence]], but at the same time sees [[nonviolent action]] (also called [[civil resistance]]) as an alternative to passive acceptance of oppression or armed struggle against it. In general, advocates of an activist philosophy of nonviolence use diverse methods in their campaigns for social change, including critical forms of education and persuasion, mass noncooperation, [[civil disobedience]], nonviolent [[direct action]], and social, political, cultural and economic forms of intervention.
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F065187-0014, Bonn, Pressekonferenz der Grünen, Bundestagswahl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Petra Kelly]] founded the German Green Party on nonviolence]]

In modern times, nonviolent methods of action have been a powerful tool for social protest and revolutionary social and political change.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Brian Adler, Neil Towne, ''Looking Out/Looking In: Interpersonal Communication'', 9th ed.

Turpin, ''Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict'', p.557, 1999. "In the West, nonviolence is well recognized for its tactical, strategic, or political aspects. It is seen as a powerful tool for redressing social inequality."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Kurlansky]], ''Nonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea'', Foreword by [[Dalai Lama]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=loIfgZgr9BsC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=all+religions++nonviolence&amp;ei=bw_nSqSdBKa2NMalmYcM#v=onepage&amp;q=dangerous&amp;f=false p. 5-6], Modern Library (April 8, 2008), {{ISBN|0-8129-7447-6}} "Advocates of nonviolence — dangerous people — have been there throughout history, questioning the greatness of Caesar and Napoleon and the Founding Fathers and Roosevelt and Churchill."&lt;/ref&gt; There are many examples of their use.

Here certain movements particularly influenced by a philosophy of nonviolence should be mentioned, including [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]] leading a successful decades-long nonviolent struggle against [[British Raj|British rule in India]], [[Martin Luther King]]'s and [[James Bevel]]'s adoption of Gandhi's nonviolent methods in their campaigns to win [[civil rights]] for [[African American]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"James L.

The term "nonviolence" is often linked with or used as a synonym for peace, and despite being frequently equated with passivity and pacifism, this is rejected by nonviolent advocates and activists.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Peter and Jack DuVall (2001) "A Force More Powerful: A Century of Non-Violent Conflict"(Palgrave Macmillan)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonviolence refers specifically to the absence of violence and is always the choice to do no harm or the least harm, and passivity is the choice to do nothing.  Sometimes nonviolence is passive, and other times it isn't. For example, if a house is burning down with mice or insects in it, the most harmless appropriate action is to put the fire out, not to sit by and passively let the fire burn. There is at times confusion and contradiction written about nonviolence, harmlessness and passivity. A confused person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in other contexts. For example, someone who passionately opposes abortion or meat eating may concurrently advocate violence to kill an abortionist or attack a slaughterhouse, which makes that person a violent person.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, Introduction, in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 3 and 13-20.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Expand-section|date=October 2017}}
Nonviolence or ''Ahimsa'' is one of the cardinal virtues&lt;ref name=evpc/&gt; and an important tenet of [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. It is a multidimensional concept,&lt;ref name=arapura&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; see Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. It has also been related to the notion that any violence has [[Karma|karmic]] consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of ''Ahimsa'', the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism.&lt;ref name=evpc&gt;Stephen H. Phillips &amp; other authors (2008), in Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict (Second Edition), {{ISBN|978-0-12-373985-8}}, Elsevier Science, Pages 1347–1356, 701–849, 1867&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chapple1990&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Nonviolence to animals, earth and self in Asian Traditions (see Chapter 1). State University of New York Press (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parsvanatha]], the twenty-third ''[[tirthankara]]'' of Jainism, revived,  advocated for and preached the concept of nonviolence in around eighth-century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Parshvanatha |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Parshvanatha |work=britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahavira]], the twenty-fourth and the last ''tirthankara'' further strengthened the idea in sixth-century BC; which was believed to be founded by the first tirthankara [[Rishabhanatha|Rushabhdev]] over a million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mahavira |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mahavira-Jaina-teacher |work=britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=SXgEfiNY46sC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=Rushabhdev+million#v=onepage&amp;q=Rushabhdev%20million&amp;f=false | title=Thoughts from the Cosmic Field in the Life of a Thinking Insect &amp;#91;A Latter-Day Saint&amp;#93;| isbn=9781606938461| last1=Patel| first1=Haresh| date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
Advocates of nonviolent action believe cooperation and consent are the roots of civil or political power: all regimes, including bureaucratic institutions, financial institutions, and the armed segments of society (such as the military and police); depend on compliance from citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = The Politics of Nonviolent Action | publisher = Porter Sargent | year = 1973 | page = 12 | isbn = 978-0-87558-068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a national level, the strategy of nonviolent action seeks to undermine the power of rulers by encouraging people to withdraw their consent and cooperation. The forms of nonviolence draw inspiration from both religious or ethical beliefs and political analysis. Religious or ethically based nonviolence is sometimes referred to as ''principled,'' ''philosophical,'' or ''ethical'' nonviolence, while nonviolence based on political analysis is often referred to as ''tactical,'' ''strategic,'' or ''pragmatic'' nonviolent action. Commonly, both of these dimensions may be present within the thinking of particular movements or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nv2.htm Two Kinds of Nonviolent Resistance] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[Gene Sharp]], in his book ''The Politics of Non-violent Action,'' suggests that the absence of nonviolent action from mainstream historical study is because elite interests are not served by the dissemination of techniques for social struggle that rely on the collective power of a mobilized citizenry rather than on access to wealth or weaponry. This does not seem to fit in any of the established sections, but it is a good point. --&gt;

===Pragmatic===
The fundamental concept of ''pragmatic'' (''tactical'' or ''strategic'') nonviolent action is to create a social dynamic or political movement that can create a national or international dialogue which effects social change without necessarily winning over those who wish to maintain the status quo.&lt;ref name="CRMV"&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nvpower.htm Nonviolent Resistance &amp; Political Power] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans (U.S.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolas Walter]] noted the idea that nonviolence might work "runs under the surface of Western political thought without ever quite disappearing".&lt;ref name="nw"&gt;Nicolas Walter, "Non-Violent Resistance:Men Against War". Reprinted
in Nicolas Walter, ''Damned Fools in Utopia'' edited by [[David Goodway]]. PM Press 2010.
{{ISBN|160486222X}} (pp. 37-78).&lt;/ref&gt; Walter noted [[Étienne de La Boétie]]'s ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' (sixteenth century) and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|P.B. Shelley's]] ''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'' (1819) contain arguments for resisting tyranny without using violence.&lt;ref name="nw" /&gt; In 1838, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] helped
found the [[Non-Resistance Society|New England Non-Resistance Society]], a society devoted to achieving racial and gender equality through the rejection of all violent actions.&lt;ref name="nw" /&gt;

In modern industrial democracies, nonviolent action has been used extensively by political sectors without mainstream political power such as labor, peace, environment and women's movements. Lesser known is the role that nonviolent action has played and continues to play in undermining the power of repressive political regimes in the developing world and the former eastern bloc. Susan Ives emphasizes this point by quoting [[Walter Wink]]: {{Quotation|"In 1989, thirteen nations comprising 1,695,000,000 people experienced nonviolent revolutions that succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations ... If we add all the countries touched by major nonviolent actions in our century (the Philippines, South Africa ... the independence movement in India ...), the figure reaches 3,337,400,000, a staggering 65% of humanity! All this in the teeth of the assertion, endlessly repeated, that nonviolence doesn't work in the 'real' world."|Walter Wink|Christian theologian&lt;ref name=Ives2001/&gt;}}

As a technique for social struggle, nonviolent action has been described as "the politics of ordinary people", reflecting its historically mass-based use by populations throughout the world and history.

Movements most often associated with nonviolence are the [[Non-cooperation movement|non-cooperation campaign]] for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the [[United States]], and the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]].

Also of primary significance is the notion that just means are the most likely to lead to just ends. When Gandhi said that "the means may be likened to the seed, the end to a tree," he expressed the philosophical kernel of what some refer to as ''[[prefigurative politics]]''. Martin Luther King, a student of Gandhian nonviolent resistance, concurred with this tenet, concluding that "nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek." Proponents of nonviolence reason that the actions taken in the present inevitably re-shape the social order in like form. They would argue, for instance, that it is fundamentally irrational to use violence to achieve a peaceful society.

People have come to use nonviolent methods of struggle from a wide range of perspectives and traditions. A landless peasant in Brazil may nonviolently occupy a parcel of land for purely practical motivations. If they do not, the family will starve. A Buddhist monk in Thailand may "ordain" trees in a threatened forest, drawing on the teachings of Buddha to resist its destruction. A waterside worker in England may go on strike in socialist and union political traditions. All the above are using nonviolent methods but from different standpoints. Likewise, secular political movements have utilized nonviolent methods, either as a tactical tool or as a strategic program on purely pragmatic and strategic levels, relying on their political effectiveness rather than a claim to any religious, moral or ethical worthiness.
[[File:Salt March.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Gandhi used the weapon of nonviolence against [[British Raj]]]]

Respect or love for opponents also has a pragmatic justification, in that the technique of separating the deeds from the doers allows for the possibility of the doers changing their behaviour, and perhaps their beliefs. Martin Luther King wrote, "Nonviolent resistance... avoids not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent, but he also refuses to hate him."&lt;ref name="Jr.2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Luther King, Jr.|authorlink=Martin Luther King, Jr.|title=Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnJ1NY5mbXEC&amp;pg=PT114|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-0070-0|page=114|date=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the notion of ''[[Satya]]'', or Truth, is central to the Gandhian conception of nonviolence. Gandhi saw Truth as something that is multifaceted and unable to be grasped in its entirety by any one individual. All carry pieces of the Truth, he believed, but all need the pieces of others’ truths in order to pursue the greater Truth. This led him to believe in the inherent worth of dialogue with opponents, in order to understand motivations. On a practical level, the willingness to listen to another's point of view is largely dependent on reciprocity. In order to be heard by one's opponents, one must also be prepared to listen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Nonviolence has obtained a level of institutional recognition and endorsement at the global level. On November 10, 1998, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the International [[Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

===Ethical===
For many, practicing nonviolence goes deeper than abstaining from violent behavior or words. It means overriding the impulse to be hateful and holding love for everyone, even those with whom one strongly disagrees. In this view, because violence is learned, it is necessary to unlearn violence by practicing love and compassion at every possible opportunity.  For some, the commitment to non-violence entails a belief in restorative or [[transformative justice]], an abolition of the death penalty and other harsh punishments.  This may involve the necessity of caring for those who are violent.

Nonviolence, for many, involves a respect and reverence for all [[Sentience#Animal rights and sentience|sentient]], and perhaps even [[Biocentrism (ethics)|non-sentient, beings]]. This might include [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]] against animals as property, the practice of not eating animal products or by-products ([[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]]), spiritual practices of [[Ahimsa|non-harm]] to all beings, and caring for the rights of all beings. [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[James Bevel]], and other nonviolent proponents advocated vegetarianism as part of their nonviolent philosophy. [[Ahimsa#Buddhism|Buddhists extend this respect for life]] to [[animals]], [[plants]], and even [[minerals]], while [[Ahimsa#Jainism|Jainism]] extend this respect for [[life]] to [[animals]], [[plants]] and even small organisms such as [[insects]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/animal-vegetable-mineral-the-making-of-buddhist-texts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://people.uwec.edu/ivogeler/w111/articles/jainism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical Indian text of [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]] deals with the ethics of non-violence or non-harming through verses 311-320 in Chapter 32 of [[Aram (Kural book)|Book 1]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} verses 311-320&lt;/ref&gt; further discussing [[compassion]] in Chapter 25 (verses 241-250), [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] in Chapter 26 (verses 251-260), and [[non-killing]] in Chapter 33 (verses 321-330).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf | title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary | publisher=W.H.

=====Ancient Vedic texts=====
Ahimsa as an ethical concept evolved in Vedic texts.&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walli, Koshelya: ''The Conception of Ahimsa in Indian Thought'', Varanasi 1974, p. 113–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest scripts, along with discussing ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words [[Satya]] (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: अस्मे ता त इन्द्र सन्तु '''सत्याहिंस'''न्तीरुपस्पृशः । विद्याम यासां भुजो धेनूनां न वज्रिवः ॥१३॥ [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.२२ Rigveda 10.22] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English: Unto Tähtinen (1964), Non-violence as an Ethical Principle, Turun Yliopisto, Finland, PhD Thesis, pages 23–25; {{oclc|4288274}};&lt;br&gt;For other occurrence of Ahimsa in Rigveda, see [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_५.६४ Rigveda 5.64.3], [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१.१४१ Rigveda 1.141.5];&lt;/ref&gt; later, the [[Yajurveda|Yajur Veda]] dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, "may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-39.html To do no harm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017133837/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-39.html |date=2013-10-17 }} Project Gutenberg, see translation for Yajurveda 36.18 VE;&lt;br&gt;For other occurrences of Ahimsa in Vedic literature, see [https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/150/mode/2up A Vedic Concordance] [[Maurice Bloomfield]], Harvard University Press, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Ahimsa'' appears in the text [[Taittiriya Shakha]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs several times in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' in the sense of "non-injury".&lt;ref&gt;Shatapatha Brahmana 2.3.4.30; 2.5.1.14; 6.3.1.26; 6.3.1.39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture.&lt;ref name="houben 1999"&gt;Henk M. Bodewitz in Jan E. M. Houben, K. R. van Kooij, ed., ''Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalisation of violence in "South Asian" cultural history.'' BRILL, 1999 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals ("pashu-Ahimsa"), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Problems of suffering in religions of the world.'' Cambridge University Press, 1975, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaneda gives examples of the word ''Ahimsa'' in these Upanishads.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008&gt;Kaneda, T. (2008). Shanti, peacefulness of mind. C.

Empathy for Pain in Vedic Ritual. Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, 12, 78&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''Ahimsa'' as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.

The [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest [[Upanishads]], has the earliest evidence for the [[Vedas|Vedic era]] use of the word ''Ahimsa'' in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against "all creatures" (''sarvabhuta'') and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of [[Reincarnation|rebirths]] (CU 8.15.1).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–5; English translation: Schmidt p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th-century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;M.K Sridhar and Puruṣottama Bilimoria (2007), ''Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges,'' Editors: Puruṣottama Bilimoria, Joseph Prabhu, Renuka M. Sharma, Ashgate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, page 315&lt;/ref&gt; Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D. Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmRlAgAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=I. B.

Chāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), [[Dāna|Danam]] (charity), [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapo]] (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).&lt;ref name=arapura/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar (2008), Non-violence and Its Philosophy, {{ISBN|978-81-7933-159-0}}, see page 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sandilya [[Upanishad]] lists ten forbearances: '''Ahimsa''', Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha.&lt;ref&gt;Swami, P. (2000). Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Upaniṣads: SZ (Vol. 3). Sarup &amp; Sons; see pages 630–631&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ballantyne, J. R., &amp; Yogīndra, S. (1850). A Lecture on the Vedánta: Embracing the Text of the Vedánta-sára. Presbyterian mission press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kaneda,&lt;ref name=kaneda2008/&gt; the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.

=====The Epics=====
The [[Mahabharata]], one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, [[Mahaprasthanika Parva]] has the verse:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs13117.htm Mahabharata 13.117.37–38]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मस तथाहिंसा परॊ दमः।
अहिंसा परमं दानम अहिंसा परमस तपः।
अहिंसा परमॊ यज्ञस तथाहिस्मा परं बलम।
अहिंसा परमं मित्रम अहिंसा परमं सुखम।
अहिंसा परमं सत्यम अहिंसा परमं शरुतम॥
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The above passage from Mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa is the highest [[virtue]], Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In Perspectives on Nonviolence (pp. 168–177). Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/pdf_downloads/what_is_hinduism/Sec6/WIH_Sec6_Chapter45.pdf Ahimsa: To do no harm] Subramuniyaswami, What is Hinduism?, Chapter 45, Pages 359–361&lt;/ref&gt; Some other examples where the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' are discussed include [[Adi Parva]], [[Vana Parva]] and [[Anushasana Parva]]. The [[Bhagavad Gita]], among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the [[Just war theory|theories of just war]]. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.&lt;ref name=fischer1954/&gt;

=====Self-defence, criminal law, and war=====
The classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012&gt;Balkaran, R., &amp; Dorn, A. W. (2012). [http://www.sareligionuoft.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/JAAR-Article-Violence-in-the-Valmiki-Ramayana-Just-War-Criteria-in-an-Ancient-Indian-Epic-.pdf Violence in the Vālmı̄ki Rāmāyaṇa: Just War Criteria in an Ancient Indian Epic], Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 80(3), 659–690.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996&gt;[[Klaus K.

Robinson (2003), Just War in Comparative Perspective, {{ISBN|0-7546-3587-2}}, Ashgate Publishing, see pages 114–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, B. E. (2008). Modern India's Strategic Advantage to the United States: Her Twin Strengths in Himsa and Ahimsa. Comparative Strategy, 27(2), pages 133–147&lt;/ref&gt;

;War
The precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of 'Just War'. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339–361&lt;/ref&gt; All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;

;Self-defence
In matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 12.15.55; Manu Smriti 8.349–350; Matsya Purana 226.116.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. [[Aikido]], pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. [[Morihei Ueshiba]], the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspa.com.ba/images/dec2011/full/rad8.pdf The Role of Teachers in Martial Arts] Nebojša Vasic, University of Zenica (2011); Sport SPA Vol. 8, Issue 2: 47–51; see page 46, 2nd column&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060116174614/http://www.aiki-extensions.org/pubs/conflict-body_text.pdf SOCIAL CONFLICT, AGGRESSION, AND THE BODY IN EURO-AMERICAN AND ASIAN SOCIAL THOUGHT] Donald Levine, University of Chicago (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ueshiba, Kisshōmaru (2004), ''The Art of Aikido: Principles and Essential Techniques'', Kodansha International, {{ISBN|4-7700-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Criminal law
Tähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.

; Pacifism
There is no consensus on [[pacifism]] among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of [[just war]] prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], as being an allegory,&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Mohandas K., ''The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi'' Berkeley Hills Books, Berkeley 2000&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.&lt;ref name=fischer1954&gt;Fischer, Louis: ''Gandhi: His Life and Message to the World'' Mentor, New York 1954, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Non-human life=====
The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn't found in the oldest verses of Vedas, but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD.&lt;ref name=chapple16&gt;Christopher Chapple (1993), Nonviolence to Animals, Earth, and Self in Asian Traditions, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-1498-1}}, pages 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W Norman Brown (February 1964), [http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1964_16/5-6-7/the_sanctity_of_the_cow_in_hinduism.pdf ''The sanctity of the cow in Hinduism''], The Economic Weekly, pages 245–255&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.&lt;ref&gt;D.N. Jha (2002), ''The Myth of the Holy Cow'', {{ISBN|1-85984-676-9}}, Verso&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rosen (2004), Holy Cow: The Hare Krishna Contribution to Vegetarianism and Animal Rights, {{ISBN|1-59056-066-3}}, pages 19–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu scriptures, dated to between 5th century and 1st century BC, while discussing human diet, initially suggest ''kosher'' meat may be eaten, evolving it with the suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.&lt;ref name=chapple16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Baudhayana]] Dharmasutra 2.4.7; 2.6.2; 2.11.15; 2.12.8; 3.1.13; 3.3.6; [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra 1.17.15; 1.17.19; 2.17.26–2.18.3; Vasistha Dharmasutra 14.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against ''dharma'' (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti 5.30, 5.32, 5.39 and 5.44; Mahabharata 3.199 (3.207), 3.199.5 (3.207.5), 3.199.19–29 (3.207.19), 3.199.23–24 (3.207.23–24), 13.116.15–18, 14.28; Ramayana 1-2-8:19&lt;/ref&gt; shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 592–593.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.115.59–60; 13.116.15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. [[Sushruta Samhita]], a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women,&lt;ref&gt;Kaviraj Kunja Lal Bhishagratna (1907), An English Translation of the Sushruta Samhita, Volume I, Part 2; see Chapter starting on page 469; for discussion on meats and fishes, see page 480 and onwards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 46.89; Sharirasthana 3.25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Charaka Samhita]] describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 27.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.11–12 (3.199 is 3.207 elsewhere); 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17; Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13–14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1).&lt;/ref&gt; Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 572–577 (for the Manusmṛti) and pp. 585–597 (for the Mahabharata); Tähtinen pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahabharata and the Manusmṛti (5.27–55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b095.htm Mahabharata 12.260] (12.260 is 12.268 according to another count); 13.115–116; 14.28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03207.htm Mahabharata 3.199] (3.199 is 3.207 according to another count).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 589–590; Schmidt pp. 634–635, 640–643; Tähtinen pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits ([[sannyasa|sannyasin]]s) were urged to live on a [[fruitarian]] diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt pp. 637–639; Manusmriti 10.63, 11.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212–217&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C.

Hindu Traditions and Nature: Survey Article. Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology, 10(1), 5–39&lt;/ref&gt; claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Veda]], is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. Tirukkuṛaḷ dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of Book 1 to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, [[vegetarianism]], [[non-violence|non-harming]], and [[non-killing]], respectively. ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' says that Ahimsa applies to all life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by Rev G.U. Pope, Rev W.H.

[[File:Ahimsa.svg|thumb|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes the Jain Vow of Ahimsa. The word in the middle is "Ahimsa". The wheel represents the [[dharmacakra]] which stands for the resolve to halt the cycle of reincarnation through relentless pursuit of truth and non-violence.]]
In Jainism, the understanding and implementation of ''Ahimsā'' is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw, pp. 154–160; Jindal, pp. 74–90; Tähtinen p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Killing any living being out of passions is considered ''hiṃsā'' (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is ''ahimsā'' (noninjury).{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=34}} The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the 'five vows of Jainism'. Other vows like truth (Satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=33}} In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons ([[sravakas]]) who have undertaken ''anuvrata'' (Smaller Vows) than for the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monastics]] who are bound by the [[Mahavrata]] "Great Vows".&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 158–159, 189–192; Laidlaw pp. 173–175, 179; ''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 43–46 (translation of the First Great Vow).&lt;/ref&gt; The statement ''{{IAST|ahimsā paramo dharmaḥ}}'' is often found inscribed on the walls of the [[Jain temple]]s.&lt;ref name=pauldundas160&gt;Dundas, Paul: ''The Jains'', second edition, London 2002, p. 160; Wiley, Kristi L.: ''Ahimsa and Compassion in Jainism'', in: ''Studies in Jaina History and Culture'', ed. Peter Flügel, London 2006, p. 438; Laidlaw pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 26–30, 191–195.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mahavira]] revived and reorganized the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 24 suggests the 5th century; the traditional dating of Mahavira's death is 527 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule.&lt;ref&gt;Goyal, S.R.: ''A History of Indian Buddhism'', Meerut 1987, p. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rishabhanatha]] (Ādinātha), the first Jain [[Tirthankara]], whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by [[Parshvanatha]] (Pārśvanātha)&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 19, 30; Tähtinen p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty-third [[Tirthankara]] lived in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 30 suggests the 8th or 7th century; the traditional chronology places him in the late 9th or early 8th century.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acaranga Sutra]] 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already part of the "Fourfold Restraint" (''Caujjama''), the vows taken by Parshva's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sthananga Sutra]] 266; Tähtinen p. 132; Goyal p. 83–84, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 160, 234, 241; Wiley p. 448; Granoff, Phyllis: ''The Violence of Non-Violence: A Study of Some Jain Responses to Non-Jain Religious Practices'', in: ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' 15 (1992) pp. 1–43; Tähtinen pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain tradition either [[lacto vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 166–167; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants.&lt;ref&gt;Lodha, R.M.: ''Conservation of Vegetation and Jain Philosophy'', in: ''Medieval Jainism: Culture and Environment'', New Delhi 1990, p. 137–141; Tähtinen p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal p. 89; Laidlaw pp. 54, 154–155, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrakrtangasutram 1.8.3; Uttaradhyayanasutra 10; Tattvarthasutra 7.8; Dundas pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hemacandra]]: ''Yogashastra'' 3.37; Laidlaw pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects,&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Sangave, Vilas Adinath: ''Jaina Community. A Social Survey'', second edition, Bombay 1980, p. 259; Dundas p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal pp. 89, 125–133 (detailed exposition of the classification system); Tähtinen pp. 17, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified,&lt;ref&gt;''Nisithabhasya'' (in ''Nisithasutra'') 289; Jinadatta Suri: ''Upadesharasayana'' 26; Dundas pp. 162–163; Tähtinen p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal pp. 89–90; Laidlaw pp. 154–155; Jaini, Padmanabh S.: ''Ahimsa and "Just War" in Jainism'', in: ''Ahimsa, Anekanta and Jainism'', ed. Tara Sethia, New Delhi 2004, p. 52–60; Tähtinen p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Jain communities accepted the use of military power for their defence, there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Harisena, ''Brhatkathakosa'' 124 (10th century); Jindal pp. 90–91; Sangave p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====
{{further information|Noble Eightfold Path|Buddhist ethics#Killing, causing others to kill|Buddhism and violence|Engaged Buddhism}}
In Buddhist texts ''Ahimsa'' (or its [[Pāli]] cognate {{IAST|avihiṃsā}}) is part of the [[Five Precepts]] ({{IAST|Pañcasīla}}), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.&lt;ref name="Williams2005p398"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams |title=Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgrZnmKUKtgC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33226-2 |page=398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bodhi Bhikkhu|title=Great Disciples of the Buddha: Their Lives, Their Works, Their Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teUGAAAAYAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-128-4 |pages=387 with footnote 12}};&lt;br&gt;Sarao, p. 49; Goyal p. 143; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamotte, Etienne 1988, p. 54-55"&gt;Lamotte, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for layperson, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Saving animals from slaughter for meat, is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=187–191}} The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:

{{Quote|
These five trades, O monks, should not be taken up by a lay follower: trading with weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants, trading in poison.
|Anguttara Nikaya V.177|Translated by Martine Batchelor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martine Batchelor|title=The Spirit of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fL3mykqlOJcC&amp;pg=PT59 |year=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17500-4 |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}} Full expulsion of a monk from ''sangha'' follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic ''nikaya'' code of conduct.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}}

=====War=====
Violent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;Sarao p. 53; Tähtinen pp. 95, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 95, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Raaflaub, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMxgef2VJEwC&amp;pg=PA61 ''War and Peace in the Ancient World.''] Blackwell Publishing, 2007, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence is an overriding theme within the [[Pali Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"/&gt; The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that a [[suttas|sutta]] in the ''Gamani Samyuttam'' rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 125–126. Full texts of the sutta:[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn42/sn42.003.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.&lt;ref&gt;Rune E.A. Johansson, ''The Dynamic Psychology of Early Buddhism.'' Curzon Press 1979, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 40–53. Some examples are the ''Cakkavati Sihanada Sutta'', the ''Kosala Samyutta'', the ''Ratthapala Sutta'', and the ''Sinha Sutta''. See also page 125. See also Trevor Ling, ''Buddhism, Imperialism, and War.'' George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1979, pages 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the ''Kosala Samyutta'', in which King [[Pasenadi]], a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King [[Ajatasattu]] and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of [[Magadha]] has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). ''The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya''. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi "is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue", while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 49, 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death.&lt;ref&gt;Hammalawa Saddhatissa, ''Buddhist Ethics.'' Wisdom Publications, 1997, pages 60, 159, see also Bartholomeusz page 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 44, 121–122, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]], there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, ''"Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any."'' Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/04_02.html#03_02 The Buddha and His Dhamma]. Columbia.edu.

==Methods==
[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King]] speaking at the 1963 "[[March on Washington]]".]]
Nonviolent action generally comprises three categories: ''Acts of Protest and Persuasion'', ''Noncooperation'', and ''Nonviolent Intervention''.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[https://www.un.org/events/nonviolence/2008/background.shtml United Nations International Day of Non-Violence], United Nations, 2008. see [[International Day of Non-Violence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts of protest===

Nonviolent acts of protest and persuasion are symbolic actions performed by a group of people to show their support or disapproval of something. The goal of this kind of action is to bring public awareness to an issue, persuade or influence a particular group of people, or to facilitate future nonviolent action. The message can be directed toward the public, opponents, or people affected by the issue.  Methods of protest and persuasion include speeches, public communications, [[petition]]s, symbolic acts, art, [[Demonstration (people)|processions (marches), and other public assemblies]].&lt;ref name="sharp2005" &gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = Waging Nonviolent Struggle | publisher = Extending Horizon Books | year = 2005 | pages = 50–65 | isbn = 978-0-87558-162-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noncooperation===

Noncooperation involves the purposeful withholding of cooperation or the unwillingness to initiate in cooperation with an opponent. The goal of noncooperation is to halt or hinder an industry, political system, or economic process. Methods of noncooperation include [[labour strike]]s, [[boycotts|economic boycotts]], [[civil disobedience]], [[sex strike]], [[Tax resistance|tax refusal]], and general disobedience.&lt;ref name="sharp2005" /&gt;

===Nonviolent intervention===

Compared with protest and noncooperation, nonviolent intervention is a more direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory. Intervention is often more immediate and effective than the other two methods, but is also harder to maintain and more taxing to the participants involved.

[[Gene Sharp]], a political scientist who seeks to advance the worldwide study and use of strategic nonviolent action in conflict, has written extensively about the methods of nonviolent action.  In his book ''Waging Nonviolent Struggle'' he describes 198 methods of nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://peacemagazine.org/198.htm  | title = The Methods of Nonviolent Action | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | year = 1973 | publisher = Peace magazine | accessdate = 2008-11-07 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Greece, [[Aristophanes]]' [[Lysistrata]] gives the fictional example of women withholding sexual favors from their husbands until war was abandoned. A modern work of fiction inspired by Gene Sharp and by Aristophanes is ''[[A Door into Ocean]]'' by [[Joan Slonczewski]], depicting an ocean world inhabited by women who use nonviolent means to repel armed space invaders. Other methods of nonviolent intervention include occupations ([[sit-in]]s), [[blockade]]s, fasting ([[hunger strikes]]), truck cavalcades, and dual sovereignty/parallel government.&lt;ref name="sharp2005" /&gt;

Tactics must be carefully chosen, taking into account political and cultural circumstances, and form part of a larger plan or strategy.

Successful [[Third Party Nonviolent Intervention|nonviolent cross-border intervention]] projects include the Guatemala Accompaniment Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisgua.org/ Network in Solidarity with the People of Guatemala]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peace Brigades International]] and [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]]. Developed in the early 1980s, and originally inspired by the Gandhian [[Shanti Sena]], the primary tools of these organisations have been nonviolent protective accompaniment, backed up by a global support network which can respond to threats, local and regional grassroots diplomatic and [[peacebuilding]] efforts, human rights observation and witnessing, and reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PBI's principles | url=http://www.peacebrigades.org/about-pbi/how-we-work/ | website=Peace Brigades International | publisher=PBI General Assembly | origyear=1992 | year=2001 | accessdate=2009-05-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602190353/http://www.peacebrigades.org/about-pbi/how-we-work/ | archivedate=2010-06-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Christian Peace Maker Teams Mission Statement | url=http://www.cpt.org/about/mission | website=Christian Peacemaker Team | publisher=CPT founding conference | year=1986 | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In extreme cases, most of these groups are also prepared to do interpositioning: placing themselves between parties who are engaged or threatening to engage in outright attacks in one or both directions.  Individual and large group cases of interpositioning, when called for, have been remarkably effective in dampening conflict and saving lives.

Another powerful tactic of nonviolent intervention invokes public scrutiny of the oppressors as a result of the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = The Politics of Nonviolent Action | publisher = P.

==Revolution==
Certain individuals ([[Barbara Deming]], [[Danilo Dolci]], [[Devere Allen]] etc.) and party groups (e.g. [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]], [[Pacifist Socialist Party]] or [[War Resisters League]]) have advocated [[nonviolent revolution]] as an alternative to violence as well as elitist reformism. This perspective is usually connected to militant [[anti-capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Many leftist and socialist movements &lt;!-- which movements? --&gt; have hoped to mount a "peaceful revolution" by organising enough strikers to completely paralyse the state and corporate apparatus, allowing workers to re-organise society along radically different lines. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Some have argued that a relatively nonviolent revolution would require fraternisation with military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1555 Daniel Jakopovich: Revolution and the Party in Gramsci's Thought: A Modern Application.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Ernesto Che Guevara]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] were fervent critics of nonviolence, arguing variously that nonviolence and pacifism are an attempt to impose the morals of the [[bourgeoisie]] upon the [[proletariat]], that violence is a necessary accompaniment to revolutionary change or that the right to self-defense is fundamental. Note, for example, the complaint of Malcolm X that "I believe it's a crime for anyone being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself."&lt;ref&gt;X, Malcolm and Alex Haley:''"The Autobiography of Malcolm X"'', page 366. Grove Press, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] argued that the nonviolent resistance strategy of Gandhi could be effective in countries with "a free press and the right of assembly", which could make it possible "not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary"; but he was skeptical of Gandhi's approach being effective in the opposite sort of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. ''Reflections on Gandhi'', Partisan Review, January 1949.  Found at http://www.orwell.ru/library/reviews/gandhi/english/e_gandhi on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reinhold Niebuhr]] similarly affirmed Gandhi's approach while criticising aspects of it. He argued, "The advantage of non-violence as a method of expressing moral goodwill lies in the fact that it protects the agent against the resentments which violent conflict always creates in both parties to a conflict, and it proves this freedom of resentment and ill-will to the contending party in the dispute by enduring more suffering than it causes." However, Niebuhr also held, "The differences between violent and non-violent methods of coercion and resistance are not so absolute that it would be possible to regard violence as a morally impossible instrument of social change."&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, Reinhold. ''[[Moral Man and Immoral Society]]'', Charles Scribner's Sons. 1932. Chapter 9.  Found at http://www.colorado.edu/ReligiousStudies/chernus/4800/MoralManAndImmoralSociety/Section6.htm on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of repression of radical [[African American]] groups in the United States during the 1960s, [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] member [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] said of the nonviolent tactics of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The concept of nonviolence is a false ideal. It presupposes the existence of compassion and a sense of justice on the part of one's adversary. When this adversary has everything to lose and nothing to gain by exercising justice and compassion, his reaction can only be negative."&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, George. Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson. Lawrence Hill Books, 1994. {{ISBN|1-55652-230-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;Walters, Wendy W. At Home in Diaspora. U of Minnesota Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8166-4491-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Malcolm X also clashed with civil rights leaders over the issue of nonviolence, arguing that violence should not be ruled out if no option remained.

In his book ''How Nonviolence Protects the State'', [[anarchist]] [[Peter Gelderloos]] criticises nonviolence as being ineffective, racist, statist, patriarchal, tactically and strategically inferior to militant activism, and deluded.&lt;ref name="Gelderloos"&gt;Gelderloos, Peter. ''How Nonviolence Protects the State''. Boston: [[South End Press]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gelderloos claims that traditional histories whitewash the impact of nonviolence, ignoring the involvement of militants in such movements as the [[Indian independence movement]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and falsely showing Gandhi and King as being their respective movement's most successful activists.&lt;ref name="Gelderloos"/&gt;{{rp|7–12}} He further argues that nonviolence is generally advocated by privileged white people who expect "oppressed people, many of whom are people of color, to suffer patiently under an inconceivably greater violence, until such time as the Great White Father is swayed by the movement's demands or the pacifists achieve that legendary 'critical mass.'"&lt;ref name="Gelderloos"/&gt;{{rp|23}} On the other hand, anarchism also includes a section committed to nonviolence called [[anarcho-pacifism]].&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence "Resisting the Nation State, the pacifist and anarchist tradition" by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt; The main early influences were the thought of [[Henry David Thoreau]]&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; and [[Leo Tolstoy]] while later the ideas of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] gained importance.&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; It developed "mostly in Holland, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], before and during the [[Second World War]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=George Woodcock|first=George|last=Woodstock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|quote=Finally, somewhat aside from the curve that runs from anarchist individualism to anarcho-syndicalism, we come to Tolstoyanism and to pacifist anarchism that appeared, mostly in the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the United states, before and after the Second World War and which has continued since then in the deep in the anarchist involvement in the protests against nuclear armament.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficacy of nonviolence was also challenged by some anti-capitalist protesters advocating a "[[diversity of tactics]]" during street demonstrations across Europe and the US following [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the anti-World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, Washington in 1999]]. American [[feminism|feminist]] writer [[D. A. Clarke]], in her essay "A Woman With A Sword," suggests that for nonviolence to be effective, it must be "practiced by those who could easily resort to force if they chose."

Nonviolence advocates see some truth in this argument: Gandhi himself said often that he could teach nonviolence to a violent person but not to a coward and that true nonviolence came from renouncing violence, not by not having any to renounce.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Advocates responding to criticisms of the efficacy of nonviolence point to the success of non-violent struggles even against the Nazi regimes in [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|Denmark]] and even in [[Rosenstrasse protest|Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Stoltzfus]], ''Resistance of the Heart: Intermarriage and the Rosenstrasse Protest in Nazi Germany'', [[Rutgers University Press]] (March 2001) {{ISBN|0-8135-2909-3}} (paperback: 386 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan found that nonviolent revolutions are twice as effective as violent ones and lead to much greater degrees of democratic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Civil Resistance Works, The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", New York: Columbia University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study finds that "increasing levels of globalization are positively associated with the emergence of nonviolent campaigns, while negatively influencing the probability of violent campaigns.

[[File:Matisse - Vase of Sunflowers (1898).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henri Matisse]], ''Vase of Sunflowers'', 1898–1899, [[State Hermitage Museum]] [[Saint Petersburg, Russia]].]]

'''Painterliness''' is a concept based on the [[German language|German]] term '''''{{lang|de|malerisch}}''''' (painterly), a word popularized by Swiss [[art historian]] [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945) to help focus, enrich and standardize the terms being used by art historians of his time to characterize [[Work of art|works of art]].  It is the opposite of [[Linear (art)|linear]], plastic or formal linear design.&lt;ref&gt;For further clarification of the meaning of ''malerisch'' read ''Francis Bacon: Logic of Sensation'' by [[Gilles Deleuze]].&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[oil painting]] is painterly when there are visible [[Brush#Paintbrushes|brushstroke]]s, the result of applying paint in a less than completely controlled manner, generally without closely following carefully drawn lines. Works characterized as either painterly or linear can be produced with any painting media: oils, acrylics, watercolors, gouache, etc. Some artists whose work could be characterized as painterly are [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], and [[John Singer Sargent]]. In watercolor it might be represented by the early watercolors of [[Andrew Wyeth]].

In contrast, ''linear'' could describe the painting of artists such as [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], [[Michelangelo]], and [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], whose works depend on creating the illusion of a degree of [[three-dimensional]]ity by means of "modeling the form" through skillful drawing, shading, and an academic rather than impulsive use of color. Contour and pattern are more in the province of the linear artists, while dynamism is the most common trait of painterly works.

The [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Abstract Expressionism|Abstract Expressionists]] tended strongly to be painterly movements.

Painterly art often makes use of the many visual effects produced by paint on canvas such as chromatic progression, warm and cool tones, [[Color wheel|complementary and contrasting colors]], broken tones, broad brushstrokes, [[Sketch (drawing)|sketchiness]], and [[impasto]].

==Other usage==
Although ''painterly'' generally refers to a certain use of paint in art, it happens that some forms of [[sculpture]] make use of apparently random surface effects which, if not exactly resembling brushstrokes, contain the traits of painterliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wölfflin |first=Heinrich |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pjwhZxy7fYAC&amp;pg=PA54 |title=Principles of Art History |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |page=54 |isbn=9780486141763}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of the term ''painterly'' outside of painting may help the viewer or listener experience more deeply the significance of [[Auguste Rodin]]'s surfaces or [[Richard Strauss]]'s flow of chromatic harmonies.

"Painterly" is used to describe computer software, especially mobile apps, designed to create special effects on photographs, mimicking recognizably artistic styles such as oils, watercolors, Japanese woodcuts, etc., or based on styles like van Gogh or Monet, and so on. The resulting photographs are also called "painterly." &lt;ref&gt;{{url=http://iphonephotographyschool.com/painterly-apps/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paremiology''' ({{Etymology|gre|παροιμία (paroimía)|proverb, maxim, saw}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dparoimi%2Fa παροιμία], [[Henry George Liddell]], Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;  is the collection and study of [[proverb]]s.

==History==
Paremiology can be dated back as far as [[Aristotle]]. [[Paremiography]], on the other hand, is the collection of proverbs. The proverb scholar [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines the term ''proverb'' as follows:

{{Quote|A proverb is a short, generally known sentence of the folk which contains wisdom, truth, morals, and traditional views in a metaphorical, fixed and memorizable form and which is handed down from generation to generation.|Mieder 1985:119; also in Mieder 1993:24}}

==Categorization==
As well as actual proverbs, the following may be considered proverbial phrases:
* proverbial comparison, such as "as busy as a bee."
* proverbial interrogative, such as "Does a chicken have lips?"
* [[wellerism]], named after [[Sam Weller (fictional character)|Sam Weller]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'' (1837), is a triad that consists of a statement (often a proverb), an identification of a speaker (person or animal), and a phrase that places the statement into an unexpected situation. An example: "Every evil is followed by some good," the man said when his wife died the day after he became bankrupt.
*[[anti-proverb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mieder|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Litovkina|first2=Anna|title=Twisted Wisdon: Modern Anti-Proverbs|date=2002|publisher=DeProverbio}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[perverb]]. This is a misuse or adaptation of a familiar proverb to twist or change its meaning. Examples include: "Nerds of a feather flock together," "Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and likely to talk about it," and "Absence makes the heart grow wander." Anti-proverbs are common on T-shirts, such as "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatoshop.com/product/If-At-First-You-Dont-Succeed-Skydiving-Isnt-For-You |title=T-shirt with anti-proverb |publisher=Neatoshop.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even classic Latin proverbs can be remolded as anti-proverbs, such as "[[Carpe diem|Carpe noctem]]." and "Carpe per diem." Anti-proverbs are not new; [[Aristophanes]] is credited with creating one over 2,300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;p. 5, Alster, Bendt. 1979. "An Akkadian and a Greek proverb: A comparative study". ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[proverbial expression]], such as "to bite the dust." This is not strictly a proverb, which should be a fixed unchangeable sentence; a proverbial expression permits alteration to fit the grammar of the context.&lt;ref name=folk&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1497581 "Proverbial Phrases from California"], by Owen S. Adams, ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 8, No. 2 (1949), pp. 95-116 {{doi|10.2307/1497581}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[allusion]], which is a reference to a proverb rather than a statement of the proverb. An example: "The new boss will probably fire some of the old staff, you know what they say about a ''new broom''." This allusion refers to the proverb "A new broom sweeps clean."&lt;ref name=folk/&gt;

==Styles==
Typical stylistic features of proverbs (as Shirley Arora points out in her article, ''The Perception of Proverbiality'' (1984)) are:

* [[Alliteration]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Fionnuala Carson. 2011. Alliteration in English-Language Versions of Current Widespread European Idioms and Proverbs. Jonathan Roper,  (ed.) ''Alliteration in Culture'', pp. 34-44. England: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; (Forgive and forget)
* [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] (Nothing ventured, nothing gained)
* [[Rhyme]] (When the cat is away, the mice will play)
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]] (Once bitten, twice shy)

==Poetic techniques==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
In some languages, [[assonance]], the repetition of a vowel, is also exploited in forming artistic proverbs, such as the following extreme example from [[Oromo language|Oromo]], of Ethiopia.
* kan mana baala, aɂlaa gaala ("A leaf at home, but a camel elsewhere"; somebody who has a big reputation among those who do not know him well.)
Similarly, from [[Tajik language|Tajik]]:
* Az yak palak ― chand handalak ("From one vine, many different melons.")
* Man taanna adraka ma tamanna ("No point in running, one should leave on time.") Arabic
Notice that in all of these cases of complete assonance, the vowel is &lt;a&gt;, the most common vowel in human languages.

Also in [[Amharic]], complete assonance is not infrequent when verbs are in the 3rd person masculine singular, past tense. The vowel &lt;ä&gt; is the most frequent vowel in the language.
*yälämmänä mänämmänä - (The one who begs becomes thin.)

Internal features that can be found quite frequently include:
* [[Hyperbole]] (All is fair in love and war)
* [[Paradox]] (For there to be peace there must first be war)
* [[Personification]] (Hunger is the best cook)

==Metaphorical links==
To make the respective statement more general most proverbs are based on a [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Mac Coinnigh, Marcas. ‘[https://www.academia.edu/2353903/_The_Heart_of_Irish-Language_Proverbs_An_Linguo-Stylistic_Analysis_of_Explicit_Metaphor The Heart of Irish-Language Proverbs? A Linguo-stylistic Analysis of Explicit Metaphor’]. Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship 30 (2013): 113-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Further typical features of the proverb are its shortness and the fact that its author is generally unknown.
[[File:Nimm dich selbst by der Nase.JPG|thumb|''Nimm dich selbst bei der Nase'' ("take yourself by your nose"). It's also called "Vogel Selbsterkenntnis" (Bird of self-knowledge)]]

==Interpretations from other languages==
In the article "Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding", Joseph Raymond comments on what common [[Russian proverbs]] from the 18th and 19th centuries portray: Potent antiauthoritarian proverbs reflected tensions between the Russian people and the [[Czar]]. The rollickingly malicious undertone of these folk verbalizations constitutes what might be labeled a "paremiological revolt". To avoid openly criticizing a given authority or cultural pattern, folk take recourse to proverbial expressions which voice personal tensions in a tone of generalized consent.{{huh|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;J. Raymond. 1956. Tensions in Proverbs: More Light on International Understanding. ''Western Folklore'' 15.3, pg 153-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs that speak to the political disgruntlement include: "When the Czar spits into the soup dish, it fairly bursts with pride"; "If the Czar be a rhymester, woe be to the poets"; and "The hen of the [[Czarina]] herself does not lay swan's eggs". While none of these proverbs state directly, "I hate the Czar and detest my situation" (which would have been incredibly dangerous), they do get their points across.

Proverbs are found in many parts of the world, but some areas seem to have richer stores of proverbs than others (such as West Africa), while others have hardly any (North and South America) (Mieder 2004b:108,109).

==Users of proverbs==
Proverbs are used by speakers for a variety of purposes.  Sometimes they are used as a way of saying something gently, in a veiled way (Obeng 1996). Other times, they are used to carry more weight in a discussion, a weak person is able to enlist the tradition of the ancestors to support his position, or even to argue a legal case.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Messenger Jr. The Role of Proverbs in a Nigerian Judicial System. ''Southwestern Journal of Anthropology''. 15:1 (Spring, 1959) pp. 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proverbs can also be used to simply make a conversation/discussion more lively.  In many parts of the world, the use of proverbs is a mark of being a good orator.

==Uses of paremiology==
The study of proverbs has application in a number of fields. Clearly, those who study [[folklore]] and [[literature]] are interested in them, but scholars from a variety of fields have found ways to profitably incorporate the study proverbs. For example, they have been used to study abstract reasoning of children, acculturation of immigrants, intelligence, the differing mental processes in mental illness, cultural themes, etc.  Proverbs have also been incorporated into the strategies of social workers, teachers, preachers, and even politicians. (For the deliberate use of proverbs as a propaganda tool by [[Nazi]]s, see Mieder 1982.)

There are collections of sayings that offer instructions on how to play certain games, such as [[dominoes]] (Borajo ''et al.'' 1990) and the Oriental board game [[go (board game)|go]] (Mitchell 2001).  However, these are not prototypical proverbs in that their application is limited to one domain.

==Folklore==
One of the most important developments in the study of proverbs (as in folklore scholarship more generally) was the shift to more ethnographic approaches in the 1960s. This approach attempted to explain proverb use in relation to the context of a speech event, rather than only in terms of the content and meaning of the proverb.&lt;ref&gt;E. Ojo Arewa and [[Alan Dundes]].  Proverbs and the Ethnography of Speaking Folklore. American Anthropologist. 66: 6, Part 2: The Ethnography of Communication (Dec 1964), pp. 70-85. Richard Bauman and Neil McCabe. Proverbs in an LSD Cult. The Journal of American Folklore. Vol. 83, No. 329 (Jul. - Sep., 1970), pp. 318-324.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive science==
Another important development in scholarship on proverbs has been applying methods from cognitive science to understand the uses and effects of proverbs and proverbial metaphors in social relations.&lt;ref name="Richard P. Honeck 1997"&gt;Richard P. Honeck. A proverb in mind: the cognitive science of proverbial wit and wisdom. Routledge, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53895">'''Pessimism''' is a mental attitude in which an undesirable outcome is anticipated from a given situation. Pessimists tend to focus on the negatives of life in general. A common question asked to test for pessimism is "[[Is the glass half empty or half full?]]"; in this situation a pessimist is said to see the glass as half empty, while an [[optimism|optimist]] is said to see the glass as half full. Throughout history, the pessimistic disposition has had effects on all major areas of thinking.&lt;ref name="ben"&gt;Bennett, Oliver. ''Cultural pessimism.'' Edinburgh university press.  2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Philosophical pessimism''' is the related idea that views the world in a strictly anti-optimistic fashion. This form of pessimism is not an emotional disposition as the term commonly connotes. Instead, it is a philosophy or worldview that directly challenges the notion of progress and what may be considered the faith-based claims of optimism. Philosophical pessimists are often [[existential nihilism|existential nihilists]] believing that life has no intrinsic meaning or value. Their responses to this condition, however, are widely varied and often life-affirming.

==Etymology==
The term pessimism derives from the Latin word ''pessimus'' meaning 'the worst'. It was first used by [[Jesuit]] critics of Voltaire's 1759 novel '[[Candide, ou l'Optimisme]]'. Voltaire was satirizing the philosophy of [[Leibniz]] who maintained that this was the 'best (optimum) of all possible worlds'. In their attacks on Voltaire, the Jesuits of the ''Revue de Trévoux'' accused him of ''pessimisme''.&lt;ref name="Dienstag"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Dienstag |first=Joshua Foa |title=Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=February 17, 2009 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical pessimism==&lt;!-- "Philosophical pessimism" redirects here --&gt;
[[File:DOI Rousseau.jpg|thumb|250px|Rousseau's ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' was an attack on the enlightenment idea of social progress which he saw as morally decadent.]]
Philosophical pessimism is not a state of mind or a psychological disposition, but rather it is a [[worldview]] or [[ethic]] that seeks to face up to the distasteful realities of the world and eliminate irrational hopes and expectations (such as the [[Idea of Progress]] and [[religious faith]]) which may lead to undesirable outcomes. Ideas which prefigure philosophical pessimism can be seen in ancient texts such as the [[Dialogue of Pessimism]] and [[Ecclesiastes]] (which maintains that everything is ''hevel'', literally 'vapor' or 'breath', but could also mean '[[senseless]]' and '[[absurdity|absurd]]'.)

In [[Western philosophy]], philosophical pessimism is not a single coherent movement, but rather a loosely associated group of thinkers with similar ideas and a family resemblance to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit'', Joshua Foa Dienstag outlines the main propositions shared by most philosophical pessimists as "that time is a burden; that the course of history is in some sense [[irony|ironic]]; that [[free will|freedom]] and [[happiness]] are incompatible; and that human existence is absurd."&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical pessimists see the [[self-consciousness]] of man as bound up with his consciousness of time and that this leads to greater suffering than mere physical pain. While many organisms live in the present, humans and certain species of animals can contemplate the past and future, and this is an important difference. Human beings have foreknowledge of their own eventual fate and this "terror" is present in every moment of our lives as a reminder of the impermanent nature of life and of our inability to control this change.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical pessimistic view of the effect of historical progress tends to be more negative than positive. The philosophical pessimist does not deny that certain areas like science can "progress" but they deny that this has resulted in an overall improvement of the human condition. In this sense it could be said that the pessimist views history as ironic; while seemingly getting better, it is mostly in fact not improving at all, or getting worse.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This is most clearly seen in Rousseau's critique of enlightenment civil society and his preference for man in the primitive and natural state. For Rousseau, "our souls have become corrupted to the extent that our sciences and our arts have advanced towards perfection".&lt;ref&gt;Jean Jacques Rousseau, ''Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts''&lt;/ref&gt;

The pessimistic view of the human condition is that it is in a sense "absurd". [[Absurdism|Absurdity]] is seen as an ontological mismatch between our desire for meaning and fulfillment and our inability to find or sustain those things in the world, or as Camus puts it: "a divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Camus, Albert, ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that rational thought would lead to human flourishing can be traced to [[Socrates]] and is at the root of most forms of western optimistic philosophies. Pessimism turns the idea on its head, it faults the human freedom to reason as the feature that misaligned humanity from our world and sees it as the root of human unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

The responses to this predicament of the human condition by pessimists are varied. Some philosophers, such as [[Schopenhauer]] and [[Mainländer]], recommend a form of resignation and self-denial (which they saw exemplified in [[Indian religions]] and [[Christian monasticism]]). Some followers tend to believe that "expecting the worst leads to the best." [[Rene Descartes]] even believed that life was better if emotional reactions to "negative" events were removed.  [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] asserted that with cultural and technological progress, the world and it's inhabitants will reach a state in which they will voluntarily embrace [[nothingness]]. Others like [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Giacomo Leopardi|Leopardi]], [[Julius Bahnsen]] and [[Albert Camus|Camus]] respond with a more life-affirming view, what Nietzsche called a "Dionysian pessimism", an embrace of life as it is in all of its constant change and suffering, without appeal to progress or hedonistic calculus. Albert Camus indicated that the common responses to the absurdity of life are often: [[Suicide]], a [[leap of faith]] (as per [[Kierkegaard]]'s [[knight of faith]]), or recognition/rebellion. Camus rejected all but the last option as unacceptable and inauthentic responses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Philosophical pessimism has often been tied to the arts and literature. Schopenhauer's philosophy was very popular with composers ([[Wagner]], [[Brahms]] and [[Mahler]]).&lt;ref name="Wicks"&gt;{{citation|chapter-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/|title= Wicks, Robert "Arthur Schopenhauer"|chapter= Arthur Schopenhauer|publisher= Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year= 2017}}, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; Several philosophical pessimists also wrote novels or poetry (Camus and Leopardi respectively). A distinctive literary form which has been associated with pessimism is [[aphorism|aphoristic writing]], and this can be seen in Leopardi, Nietzsche and Cioran. Writers which could be said to express pessimistic views in their works or to be influenced by pessimistic philosophers include [[Miguel de Cervantes]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Sadegh Hedayat]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Charles Bukowski]], [[Thomas Mann]], [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]], [[Mihai Eminescu]], [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Cormac McCarthy]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Dino Buzzati]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Michel Houellebecq]], [[Thomas Ligotti]], [[Thomas Bernhard]] and [[Camilo Pessanha]].

==Notable proponents==

===Ancient Greeks===
In ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', Friedrich Nietzsche argued that the [[pre-Socratic]] philosophers such as [[Anaximander]], [[Heraclitus]] (called "the Weeping Philosopher") and [[Parmenides]] represented a classical form of pessimism. Nietzsche saw Anaximander's philosophy as the "enigmatic proclamation of a true pessimist". Similarly, of Heraclitus' philosophy of flux and strife he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Heraclitus]] denied the duality of totally diverse worlds—a position which Anaximander had been compelled to assume. He no longer distinguished a physical world from a metaphysical one, a realm of definite qualities from an undefinable "indefinite." And after this first step, nothing could hold him back from a second, far bolder negation: he altogether denied being. For this one world which he retained [...] nowhere shows a tarrying, an indestructibility, a bulwark in the stream. Louder than Anaximander, Heraclitus proclaimed: "I see nothing other than becoming. Be not deceived. It is the fault of your short-sightedness, not of the essence of things, if you believe you see land somewhere in the ocean of becoming and passing-away. You use names for things as though they rigidly, persistently endured; yet even the stream into which you step a second time is not the one you stepped into before." ''The Birth of Tragedy. 5, pp. 51–52'' 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Greek expressed a form of pessimism in his philosophy: the ancient [[Cyrenaic]] philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]] (290 BCE). Like later pessimists, Hegesias argued that lasting happiness is impossible to achieve and that all we can do is to try to avoid pain as much as possible.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Complete happiness cannot possibly exist; for that the body is full of many sensations, and that the mind sympathizes with the body, and is troubled when that is troubled, and also that fortune prevents many things which we cherished in anticipation; so that for all these reasons, perfect happiness eludes our grasp.&lt;ref name="diogquote"&gt;{{cite LotEP|chapter=Hegesias}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hegesias of Cyrene|Hegesias]] held that all external objects, events and actions are indifferent to the wise man, even death: "for the foolish person it is expedient to live, but to the wise person it is a matter of indifference".&lt;ref name="diogquote"/&gt; According to Cicero, Hegesias wrote a book called ''Death by Starvation'', which supposedly persuaded many people that death was more desirable than life. Because of this, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] banned Hegesias from teaching in Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''[[Tusculanae Quaestiones]]'' i. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 3rd century BCE, [[Stoicism]] propounded as an exercise "the premeditation of evils"—concentration on worst possible outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Burkeman |first=Oliver |authorlink=Oliver Burkeman |title=The Antidote: Happiness for people who can't stand positive thinking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92fgjq7-qLwC |accessdate=2013-01-22 |year=2012 |publisher=Text Publishing |isbn=9781921922671 |pages=32–33 |quote=[...] the Stoics propose a[n] elegant, sustainable and calming way to deal with the possibility of things going wrong: rather than struggling to avoid all thought of these worst-case scenarios, they counsel actively dwelling on them, staring them in the face. Which brings us to an important milestone on the negative path to happiness — a psychological tactic that William [B.] Irvine argues is 'the single most valuable technique in the Stoics' toolkit'. He calls it 'negative visualisation'. The Stoics themselves, rather more pungently, called it 'the premeditation of evils'. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltasar Gracián===
[[Baltasar Gracián]] (1601–1658) was Schopenhauer's favorite author and Gracián's novel ''El Criticón'' was his favorite book{{citation needed|reason=This is a very definite claim|date=January 2015}}. Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook was influenced by Gracián, and he translated Gracián's ''The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence'' into German. He praised Gracián for his aphoristic writing style ([[conceptismo]]) and often quoted him in his works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=History dictionary of Schopenhauer's philosophy |last=Cartwright |first=David E. |publisher=Scarecrow press, Inc. |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gracian's novel ''El Criticón'' (The Critic) is an extended allegory of the human search for [[happiness]] which turns out to be fruitless on this Earth. ''The Critic'' paints a bleak and desolate picture of the human condition. His ''Pocket Oracle'' was a book of [[aphorisms]] on how to live in what he saw as a world filled with deception, duplicity and disillusionment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pocket Oracle and Art of Prudence |last=Gracian |first=Balthasar |publisher=Penguin books |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltaire===
Voltaire was the first European to be labeled as a pessimist{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} due to his critique of [[Alexander Pope]]'s optimistic "An Essay on Man", and [[Leibniz]]' affirmation that "we live in the best of all possible worlds." Voltaire's novel [[Candide]] is an extended criticism of theistic optimism and his [[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne|Poem on the Lisbon Disaster]] is especially pessimistic about the state of mankind and the nature of God. Though himself a [[Deist]], Voltaire argued against the existence of a compassionate personal God through his interpretation of the [[problem of evil]].

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===
The major themes of philosophical pessimism were first presented by Rousseau and he has been called "the patriarch of pessimism".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; For Rousseau, humans in their "natural goodness" have no sense of self-consciousness in time and thus are happier than humans corrupted by society. Rousseau saw the movement out of the [[state of nature]] as the origin of inequality and mankind's lack of freedom. The wholesome qualities of man in his natural state, a non-destructive love of self and compassion are gradually replaced by ''amour propre'', a self-love driven by pride and jealousy of his fellow man. Because of this, modern man lives "always outside himself", concerned with other men, the future and external objects. Rousseau also blames the human faculty of "perfectibility" and human language for tearing us away from our natural state by allowing us to imagine a future in which we are different than what we are now and therefore making us appear inadequate to ourselves (and thus 'perfectible').&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Rousseau saw the evolution of modern society as the replacement of natural egalitarianism by alienation and class distinction enforced by institutions of power. Thus ''[[The Social Contract]]'' opens with the famous phrase "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains." Even the ruling classes are not free, in fact for Rousseau they are "greater slaves" because they require more esteem from others to rule and must therefore constantly live "outside themselves".

===Giacomo Leopardi===
Though a lesser known figure outside Italy, [[Giacomo Leopardi]] was highly influential in the 19th century, especially for Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; In Leopardi's darkly comic essays, aphorisms, fables and parables, life is often described as a sort of divine joke or mistake. According to Leopardi, because of our conscious sense of time and our endless search for truth, the human desire for happiness can never be truly satiated and joy cannot last. Leopardi claims that "Therefore they greatly deceive themselves, [those] who declare and preach that the perfection of man consists in knowledge of the truth and that all his woes proceed from false opinions and ignorance, and that the human race will at last be happy, when all or most people come to know the truth, and solely on the grounds of that arrange and govern their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Leopardi believes that for man it is not possible to forget truth and that "it is easier to rid oneself of any habit before that of philosophizing."

Leopardi's response to this condition is to face up to these realities and try to live a vibrant and great life, to be risky and take up uncertain tasks. This uncertainty makes life valuable and exciting but does not free us from suffering, it is rather an abandonment of the futile pursuit of happiness. He uses the example of [[Christopher Columbus]] who went on a dangerous and uncertain voyage and because of this grew to appreciate life more fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dialogue between Columbus and Pedro Gutierrez (Operette morali) |last=Leopardi |first=Giacomo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leopardi also sees the capacity of humans to laugh at their condition as a laudable quality that is able to help us deal with our predicament. For Leopardi: "He who has the courage to laugh is master of the world, much like him who is prepared to die."

===Arthur Schopenhauer===
[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer had an influence upon later thinkers and artists such as Freud and Wagner]]
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s pessimism comes from his elevating of [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the .22Will.22|Will]] above [[reason]] as the mainspring of human thought and behavior. The [[Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the .22Will.22|Will]] is the ultimate metaphysical animating [[noumenon]] and it is futile, illogical and directionless striving. Schopenhauer sees reason as weak and insignificant compared to Will; in one [[metaphor]], Schopenhauer compares the human intellect to a lame man who can see, but who rides on the shoulder of the blind giant of Will.&lt;ref name="Arthur"&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Pessimism |last=Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-60206-349-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer saw human desires as impossible to satisfy. 
He pointed to motivators such as hunger, thirst and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] as the fundamental features of the Will in action, which are always by nature unsatisfactory.

&lt;blockquote&gt;All satisfaction, or what is commonly called happiness, is really and essentially always negative only, and never positive. It is not a gratification which comes to us originally and of itself, but it must always be the satisfaction of a wish. For desire, that is to say, want [or will], is the precedent condition of every pleasure; but with the satisfaction, the desire and therefore the pleasure cease; and so the satisfaction or gratification can never be more than deliverance from a pain, from a want. — ''The world as will and representation, pg 319'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schopenhauer notes that once satiated, the feeling of satisfaction rarely lasts and we spend most of our lives in a state of endless striving, in this sense, we are, deep down nothing but Will. Even the moments of satisfaction, when repeated often enough, only lead to boredom and thus human existence is constantly swinging "like a pendulum to and fro between pain and boredom, and these two are in fact its ultimate constituents".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The world as will and representation'', pg 312&lt;/ref&gt; This ironic cycle eventually allows us to see the inherent vanity at the truth of existence (''nichtigkeit'') and to realize that "the purpose of our existence is not to be happy".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur, ''The world as will and representation'', vol II, pg 635&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the business of biological life is a war of all against all filled with constant physical pain and distress, not merely unsatisfied desires. There is also the constant dread of death on the horizon to consider, which makes human life worse than animals. Reason only compounds our suffering by allowing us to realize that biology's agenda is not something we would have chosen had we been given a choice, but it is ultimately helpless to prevent us from serving it.&lt;ref name="Arthur" /&gt;

Schopenhauer saw in artistic contemplation a temporary escape from the act of willing. He believed that through "losing yourself" in art one could sublimate the Will. However, he believed that only a resignation from the pointless striving of the will to life through a form of [[asceticism]] (as those practiced by eastern monastics and by "saintly persons") could free oneself from the Will altogether.

Schopenhauer never used the term ''pessimism'' to describe his philosophy but he also didn't object when others called it that.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, David E. (2010). Schopenhauer: a Biography. Cambridge University Press. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Other common terms used to describe his thought were [[Voluntarism (philosophy)|voluntarism]] and [[irrationalism]] which he also never used.

=== Post-Schopenhauerian pessimism&lt;!--'Post-Schopenhauerian pessimism' and 'Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)' redirect here--&gt; ===
{{also|History of metaphysical realism}}
During the endtimes of Schopenhauer's life and subsequent years after his death, '''post-Schopenhauerian pessimism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; became a rather popular "trend" in 19th century Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Monika Langer, ''Nietzsche's Gay Science: Dancing Coherence'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2010, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it was viewed with disdain by the other popular philosophies at the time, such as [[Hegelianism]], [[materialism]], [[Neo-Kantianism]] and the emerging [[positivism]]. In an age of upcoming revolutions and exciting new discoveries in [[science]], the resigned and a-progressive nature of the typical pessimist was seen as detriment to social development. To respond to this growing criticism, a group of philosophers greatly influenced by Schopenhauer (indeed, some even being his personal acquaintances) developed their own brand of pessimism, each in their own unique way. Thinkers such as [[Julius Bahnsen]], [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]], [[Philipp Mainländer]] and others cultivated the ever-increasing threat of pessimism by converting Schopenhauer's [[transcendental idealism]] into what [[Frederick C. Beiser]] calls '''transcendental realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser]] reviews the commonly held position that Schopenhauer was a transcendental idealist and he rejects it: "Though it is deeply heretical from the standpoint of transcendental idealism, Schopenhauer's objective standpoint involves a form of ''transcendental realism'', i.e. the assumption of the independent reality of the world of experience." (Beiser, Frederick C., ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 40).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 213 n. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcendental idealist thesis is that we know only the appearances of things (not [[things-in-themselves]]), the transcendental realist thesis is that "the knowledge we have of how things appear to us in experience gives us knowledge of things-in-themselves."&lt;ref name=Beiser147&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, pp. 147–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

By espousing transcendental realism, Schopenhauer's own dark observations about the nature of the world would become completely knowable and objective, and in this way they would attain certainty. The certainty of pessimism being, that non-existence is preferable to existence. That, along with the metaphysical reality of the will, were the premises which the "Post-Schopenhauerian" thinkers inherited from the [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Frankfurt sage]]'s teachings. After this common starting point, each philosopher developed his own negative view of being in their respective philosophies. Some pessimists would "assuage" the critics by accepting the validity of their criticisms and embracing [[historicism]], as was the case with Schopenhauer's literary executor [[Julius Frauenstadt]] and with [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann]] (who gave transcendental realism a unique twist).&lt;ref name=Beiser147/&gt; [[Julius Bahnsen]] would reshape the understanding of pessimism overall,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Philipp Mainländer]] set out to reinterpret and elucidate the nature of the will, by presenting it as a self-mortifying will-to-death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]], ''Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2016, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friedrich Nietzsche===
Friedrich Nietzsche could be said to be a philosophical pessimist even though unlike Schopenhauer (whom he read avidly) his response to the 'tragic' pessimistic view is neither resigned nor self-denying, but a life-affirming form of pessimism. For Nietzsche this was a "pessimism of the future", a "[[Dionysian]] pessimism."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''Die fröhliche Wissenschaft'', book V&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche identified his Dionysian pessimism with what he saw as the pessimism of the Greek [[pre-socratic]]s and also saw it at the core of ancient [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; He saw tragedy as laying bare the terrible nature of human existence, bound by constant flux. In contrast to this Nietzsche saw [[Socrates|Socratic]] philosophy as an optimistic refuge of those who could not bear the tragic any longer. Since Socrates posited that wisdom could lead to happiness, Nietzsche saw this as "morally speaking, a sort of cowardice...amorally, a ruse".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche was also critical of Schopenhauer's pessimism because in judging the world negatively, it turned to moral judgements about the world and therefore led to weakness and [[nihilism]]. Nietzsche's response was a total embracing of the nature of the world, a "great liberation" through a "pessimism of strength" which "does not sit in judgement of this condition".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche believed that the task of the philosopher was to wield this pessimism like a hammer, to first attack the basis of old moralities and beliefs and then to "make oneself a new pair of wings", i.e. to [[Transvaluation of values|re-evaluate all values]] and create new ones.&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of this Dionysian pessimism was 'saying yes' to the changing nature of the world, this entailed embracing destruction and suffering joyfully, forever (hence the ideas of [[amor fati]] and [[eternal recurrence]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Pessimism for Nietzsche is an art of living that is "good for one's health" as a "remedy and an aid in the service of growing and struggling life".&lt;ref&gt;Dienstag 2009, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

===Albert Camus===
[[Image:Punishment sisyph.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Camus used the punishment of [[Sisyphus]] to represent the human condition.]]

In a 1945 article, [[Albert Camus]] wrote "the idea that a pessimistic philosophy is necessarily one of discouragement is a puerile idea."&lt;ref name="Camus"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.epubbud.com/read.php?g=DV6H76TX&amp;tocp=13|title= Albert Camus, ''Pessimism and Courage''}}, ''Combat'', September 1945&lt;/ref&gt; Camus helped popularize the idea of "[[Absurdism|the absurd]]", a key term in his famous essay ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]''. Like previous philosophical pessimists, Camus sees human consciousness and reason as that which "sets me in opposition to all creation".&lt;ref name="CamusMyth"&gt;{{cite book |last=Camus |first=Albert |authorlink=Albert Camus |title=Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-73373-7 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Camus, this clash between a reasoning mind which craves meaning and a 'silent' world is what produces the most important philosophical problem, the 'problem of suicide'. Camus believed that people often escape facing the absurd through "eluding" (''l'esquive''), a 'trickery' for "those who live not for life itself but some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it a meaning, and betray it".&lt;ref name="CamusMyth" /&gt; He considered [[suicide]] and [[religion]] as inauthentic forms of eluding or escaping the problem of existence. For Camus, the only choice was to rebelliously accept and live with the absurd, for "there is no fate that cannot be surmounted by scorn." Camus' response to the absurd problem is illustrated by using the Greek mythic character of [[Sisyphus]], who was condemned by the gods to push a boulder up a hill for eternity. Camus imagines Sisyphus while pushing the rock, realizing the futility of his task, but doing it anyway out of rebellion: "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

==Other forms==

=== Epistemological ===
There are several theories of [[epistemology]] which could arguably be said to be pessimistic in the sense that they consider it difficult or even impossible to obtain knowledge about the world. These ideas are generally related to [[nihilism]], [[philosophical skepticism]] and [[relativism]].

[[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] (1743–1819), analyzed [[rationalism]], and in particular [[Immanuel Kant]]'s "critical" philosophy in order to carry out a [[reductio ad absurdum]]{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} according to which all rationalism reduces to [[nihilism]], and thus it should be avoided and replaced with a return to some type of [[faith]] and [[revelation]].

[[Richard Rorty]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] questioned whether our particular concepts could relate to the world in any absolute way and whether we can justify our ways of describing the world as compared with other ways. In general, these philosophers argue that truth was not about getting it right or representing reality, but was part of subjective [[Foucauldian discourse analysis|social relations of power]], or [[language-games]] that served our purposes in a particular time. Therefore, these forms of [[anti-foundationalism]], while not being pessimistic per se, rejects any definitions that claims to have discovered absolute 'truths' or foundational facts about the world as valid.

===Political and cultural===
{{Main article|Cultural pessimism}}
Philosophical pessimism stands opposed to the [[optimism]] or even [[utopianism]] of [[Hegelian]] philosophies. [[Emil Cioran]] claimed "Hegel is chiefly responsible for modern optimism. How could he have failed to see that consciousness changes only its forms and modalities, but never progresses?"&lt;ref name="Cioran"&gt;Cioran, Emil. ''A short history of decay'', pg 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophical pessimism is differentiated from other political philosophies by having no ideal governmental structure or political project, rather pessimism generally tends to be an anti-systematic philosophy of individual action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dienstag|2009|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because philosophical pessimists tend to be skeptical that any politics of [[social progress]] can actually improve the human condition. As Cioran states, "every step forward is followed by a step back: this is the unfruitful oscillation of history".&lt;ref&gt;Cioran, Emil. ''A short history of decay'', pg 178&lt;/ref&gt; Cioran also attacks political optimism because it creates an "idolatry of tomorrow" which can be used to authorize anything in its name. This does not mean however, that the pessimist cannot be politically involved, as Camus argued in [[The Rebel (book)|The Rebel]].

There is another strain of thought generally associated with a pessimistic worldview, this is the pessimism of [[cultural criticism]] and [[social decline]] which is seen in [[Oswald Spengler]]'s '[[The Decline of the West]]'. Spengler promoted a [[cyclic history|cyclic model of history]] similar to the theories of [[Giambattista Vico]]. Spengler believed modern [[western civilization]] was in the 'winter' age of decline (''untergang''). Spenglerian theory was immensely influential in interwar Europe, especially in [[Weimar Germany]]. Similarly, traditionalist [[Julius Evola]] thought that the world was in the [[Kali Yuga]], a dark age of moral decline.

Intellectuals like [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] correlate economic progress with [[economic inequality]], the stimulation of artificial needs, and [[affluenza]]. [[Anti-consumerist]]s identify rising trends of [[conspicuous consumption]] and self-interested, image-conscious behavior in culture. Post-modernists like [[Jean Baudrillard]] have even argued that culture (and therefore our lives) now has no basis in reality whatsoever.&lt;ref name="ben"/&gt;

[[Conservative]] thinkers, especially [[social conservatives]], often perceive politics in a generally pessimistic way. [[William F. Buckley]] famously remarked that he was "standing athwart history yelling 'stop!'" and [[Whittaker Chambers]] was convinced that capitalism was bound to fall to [[communism]], though he was himself violently [[anti-communist]]. Social conservatives often see the West as a decadent and nihilistic civilization which has abandoned its roots in [[Christianity]] and/or [[Greeks|Greek]] [[philosophy]], leaving it doomed to fall into moral and political decay. [[Robert Bork]]'s ''Slouching Toward Gomorrah'' and [[Allan Bloom]]'s ''The Closing of the American Mind'' are famous expressions of this point of view.

Many economic conservatives and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] believe that the expansion of the state and the role of government in society is inevitable, and they are at best fighting a holding action against it.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} They hold that the natural tendency of people is to be ruled and that freedom is an exceptional state of affairs which is now being abandoned in favor of social and economic security provided by the [[welfare state]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Political pessimism has sometimes found expression in [[dystopian]] novels such as [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lowenthal |first=D |title=Orwell's Political Pessimism in '1984' |publisher=Polity |year=1969 |jstor=3234097}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political pessimism about one's country often correlates with a desire to [[emigrate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Brym |first=RJ |title=The emigration potential of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland and Russia: recent survey results |publisher=International Sociology |year=1992 |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/soc101y/brym/is.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] in the United States, the [[neologism]] "[[pessimism porn]]" was coined to describe the alleged [[Eschatology|eschatological]] and [[survivalist]] thrill some people derive from predicting, reading and fantasizing about the collapse of civil society through the destruction of the world's economic system.&lt;ref name=Lindgren&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/53858/ Pessimism Porn: A soft spot for hard times], Hugo Lindgren, ''New York'', February 9, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=7299825&amp;page=1 Pessimism Porn? Economic Forecasts Get Lurid], Dan Harris, ABC News, April 9, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mary&gt;''Apocalypse and Post-Politics: The Romance of the End'', Mary Manjikian, Lexington Books, March 15, 2012, {{ISBN|0739166220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schott&gt;[http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/23/pessimism-porn/ Pessimism Porn: Titillatingly bleak media reports], Ben Schott, ''New York Times'', February 23, 2009; accessed July 8, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technological and environmental===
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|thumb|right|Luddites destroy machines (1812)]]
Technological pessimism is the belief that advances in science and technology do not lead to an improvement in the human condition. Technological pessimism can be said to have originated during the [[industrial revolution]] with the [[Luddite]] movement. Luddites blamed the rise of industrial mills and advanced factory machinery for the loss of their jobs and set out to destroy them. The [[Romantic movement]] was also pessimistic towards the rise of technology and longed for simpler and more natural times. Poets like [[William Wordsworth]] and [[William Blake]] believed that industrialization was polluting the purity of nature.&lt;ref name=romanticism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html |title=Romanticism |publisher=Wsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718052334/http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/romanticism.html |archivedate=2008-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some social critics and environmentalists believe that [[globalization]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] and the economic practices of modern [[capitalist]] states over-stress the planet's [[Balance of nature|ecological equilibrium]]. They warn that unless something is done to slow this, [[climate change]] will worsen eventually leading to some form of social and [[ecological collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/apr/27/the-global-delusion/ The Global Delusion, John Gray]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Lovelock]] believes that the [[ecology]] of the Earth has already been irretrievably damaged, and even an unrealistic shift in politics would not be enough to save it. According to Lovelock, the Earth’s climate regulation system is being overwhelmed by pollution and the Earth will soon jump from its current state into a dramatically hotter climate.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"&gt;[[The New York Review of Books]] [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/nov/19/a-great-jump-to-disaster/ A Great Jump to Disaster?, Tim Flannery]&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock blames this state of affairs on what he calls “polyanthroponemia”, which is when: “humans overpopulate until they do more harm than good.” Lovelock states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The presence of 7 billion people aiming for first-world comforts…is clearly incompatible with the homeostasis of climate but also with chemistry, biological diversity and the economy of the system.&lt;ref name="nybooks.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some [[radical environmentalism|radical environmentalists]], [[anti-globalization]] activists, and [[Neo-luddism|Neo-luddites]] can be said to hold to this type of pessimism about the effects of modern "progress". A more radical form of environmental pessimism is [[anarcho-primitivism]] which faults the [[British Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]] with giving rise to social stratification, coercion, and alienation. Some anarcho-primitivists promote [[deindustrialization]], abandonment of modern technology and [[rewilding (anarchism)|rewilding]].

An infamous anarcho-primitivist is [[Theodore Kaczynski]], also known as the Unabomber who engaged in a nationwide mail bombing campaign. In his 1995 manifesto, ''Industrial Society and Its Future'' he called attention to the erosion of human freedom by the rise of the modern "industrial-technological system".&lt;ref&gt;[[The Washington Post]]: Unabomber Special Report: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ITS FUTURE]&lt;/ref&gt; The manifesto begins thus: &lt;blockquote&gt;The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the most radical pessimist organizations is the [[voluntary human extinction movement]] which argues for the extinction of the human race through [[antinatalism]].

[[Pope Francis]]' controversial [[Laudato si'|2015 encyclical on ecological issues]] is ripe with [[Laudato si'#Technology|pessimistic assessments of the role of technology in the modern world]].

====Entropy pessimism====
{{See also |Heat death of the universe |Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #The relevance of thermodynamics to economics |Ecological economics #Methodology}}
[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution.]]
'Entropy pessimism' represents a special case of technological and environmental pessimism, based on [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic principles]].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}} According to the [[Laws of thermodynamics#First law|first law of thermodynamics]], matter and energy is neither created nor destroyed in the economy. According to the [[Laws of thermodynamics#Second law|second law of thermodynamics]] — also known as [[Entropy|the entropy law]] — what happens in the economy is that all matter and energy is transformed from states available for human purposes (valuable [[natural resource]]s) to states unavailable for human purposes (valueless [[waste]] and [[pollution]]). In effect, all of man's technologies and activities are only speeding up the general march against a future planetary 'heat death' of degraded energy, exhausted natural resources and a deteriorated environment — a state of maximum entropy locally on earth; 'locally' on earth, that is, when compared to the [[heat death of the universe]], taken as a whole.

The term 'entropy pessimism' was coined to describe the work of [[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field |progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts |paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]].&lt;ref name=ra01/&gt;{{rp|116}} Georgescu-Roegen made extensive use of the entropy concept in his [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen #Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|magnum opus on ''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt; Since the 1990s, leading ecological economist and [[Steady-state economy #Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] — a student of Georgescu-Roegen — has been the economists profession's most influential proponent of entropy pessimism.&lt;ref name=hd02/&gt; &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|545}}

Among other matters, the entropy pessimism position is concerned with the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|369-371}} &lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253-256}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|168-171}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|150-153}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106-109}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|546-549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142-145}}

Entropy pessimism is a widespread view in [[ecological economics]] and in the [[Degrowth|degrowth movement]].

===Legal===
Bibas writes that some [[criminal defense attorney]]s prefer to err on the side of pessimism: "Optimistic forecasts risk being proven disastrously wrong at trial, an embarrassing result that makes clients angry. On the other hand, if clients plead based on their lawyers' overly pessimistic advice, the cases do not go to trial and the clients are none the wiser."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Bibas |first=Stephanos |title=Plea Bargaining outside the Shadow of Trial |publisher=Harvard Law Review |volume=117 |number=8 |date=Jun 2004 |pages=2463–2547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a psychological disposition==
[[File:Оптимист и пессимист.jpg|thumb|220px|''An optimist and a pessimist'', [[Vladimir Makovsky]], 1893]]
In the ancient world, psychological pessimism was associated with [[Melancholia|melancholy]], and was believed to be caused by an excess of black bile in the body. 
The study of pessimism has parallels with the study of [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Psychologists trace pessimistic attitudes to emotional [[suffering|pain]] or even biology. [[Aaron Beck]] argues that depression is due to unrealistic negative views about the world.  Beck starts treatment by engaging in conversation with clients about their unhelpful thoughts. Pessimists, however, are often able to provide arguments that suggest that their understanding of reality is justified; as in [[Depressive realism]] or ([[Cultural pessimism|pessimistic realism]]).&lt;ref name="ben"/&gt; Deflection is a common method used by those who are depressed. They let people assume they are revealing everything which proves to be an effective way of hiding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirszner |first=Laurie |date=January 2012 |title=Patterns for College Writing |location=United States |publisher=Bedford/St.Martins |page=477 |isbn=978-0-312-67684-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pessimism item on the [[Beck Depression Inventory]] has been judged useful in predicting suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=AT |last=Beck |first2=RA |last2=Steer |first3=M |last3=Kovacs |title=Hopelessness and eventual suicide: a 10-year prospective study of patients hospitalized with suicidal ideation |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=142 |issue=5 |pages=559–563 |year=1985 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/142/5/559|doi=10.1176/ajp.142.5.559 |pmid=3985195 |citeseerx=10.1.1.462.6328 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Beck Hopelessness Scale]] has also been described as a measurement of pessimism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=AT |last=Beck |first2=A |last2=Weissman |first3=D |last3=Lester |first4=L |last4=Trexler |title=The measurement of pessimism: the hopelessness scale |publisher=Journal of Consulting and Clinical |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wender and Klein point out that pessimism can be useful in some circumstances: "If one is subject to a series of defeats, it pays to adopt a conservative game plan of sitting back and waiting and letting others take the risks. Such waiting would be fostered by a pessimistic outlook. Similarly if one is raking in the chips of life, it pays to adopt an expansive risk taking approach, and thus maximize access to scarce resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Wender |first=PH |last2=Klein |first2=DF |title=Mind, Mood and Medicine |publisher=New American Library |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Pragmatic criticism===
Through history, some have concluded that a pessimistic attitude, although justified, must be avoided in order to endure. Optimistic attitudes are favored and of emotional consideration.&lt;ref&gt;
Michael R. Michau. "Doing, Suffering, and Creating": William James and Depression.  http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mmichau/james-and-depression.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[William James]] rejected their pessimism after suffering [[psychological illness|psychological]], or even [[psychosomatic]] illness. Criticisms of this sort however assume that pessimism leads inevitably to a mood of darkness and utter depression. Many philosophers would disagree, claiming that the term "pessimism" is being abused. The link between pessimism and [[nihilism]] is present, but the former does not necessarily lead to the latter, as philosophers such as Albert Camus believed. Happiness is not inextricably linked to [[optimism]], nor is pessimism inextricably linked to unhappiness. One could easily imagine an unhappy optimist, and a happy pessimist. Accusations of pessimism may be used to silence legitimate criticism. The economist [[Nouriel Roubini]] was largely dismissed as a pessimist, for his dire but accurate predictions of a coming global financial crisis, in 2006. ''[[Personality Plus]]'' opines that pessimistic temperaments (e.g. [[melancholy temperament|melancholy]] and [[phlegmatic temperament|phlegmatic]]) can be useful inasmuch as pessimists' focus on the negative helps them spot problems that people with more optimistic temperaments (e.g. [[choleric temperament|choleric]] and [[sanguine temperament|sanguine]]) miss.

'''''Pilgrimage to Cedars of Lebanon''''' (in Hungarian: '''''Zarándoklás a cédrusokhoz Libanonban''''') is a picture of the Hungarian painter [[Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka]] of 1907.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063625/HU_280_006.html |title=Pilgrimage to the Cedars in Lebanon, Tivadar Csontváry Kosztka |website=europeana.eu |language=en |access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hung-art.hu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hung-art.hu/frames.html?/magyar/c/csontvar/muvek/5/csont510.html |title=Zarándoklás a cédrusokhoz Libanonban |website=hung-art.hu |language=hu |access-date=23 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The picture is painted with oil paints and has dimensions of 200 × 192&amp;nbsp;cm.  The picture is in the [[Hungarian National Gallery]] in [[Budapest]].

It is one of the most iconic paintings in Hungarian painting. After 40 years Tivadar Costco Chontvari left pharmaceuticals and took up art. He traveled thousands of miles in search of inspiration. The picture of cedar trees painted in Lebanon while on pilgrimage is a key part of his work. The symbolism stems from the strong religious character. According to the ancient  beliefs, cedars play an important role in ancient Hungarian mythology.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt; The cedar is a symbol of fertility, assumed to be the tree of life and the tree of knowledge.&lt;ref name="hung-art.hu"/&gt;

In his painting, Chontvari presents his outlook, which is reflected in the art.&lt;ref name="europeana.eu"/&gt; It is a complex system of symbols, and synthesizes diverse content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/allando/178/128 |title=Csontváry Kosztka Tivadar - Zarándoklás a cédrusokhoz Libanonban |language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Jayapal was born in [[Chennai]], [[India]], to a [[Malayali]]-[[Indian people|Indian]] family and was raised in [[Indonesia]] and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pramilajayapal.com/about/|title=About|publisher=Pramila Jayapal|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pramila jaypal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newsin.asia/chennai-born-pramila-jayapal-first-indian-origin-tamil-woman-elected-us-congress/|title=Chennai-born Pramila Jayapal is the first Indian origin Tamil woman to be elected to US Congress|publisher=newsin.asia|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1982, at the age of 16, to attend college. She earned her bachelor's degree from [[Georgetown University]], and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref name="story"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pramila.jayapal1/posts/10154898514503621|title=Pramila Moves to West Seattle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Pramila Jayapal|accessdate=June 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jayapal worked with [[Paine Webber|PaineWebber]] as a financial analyst after graduating from Northwestern. In her time at PaineWebber, Jayapal developed a desire to apply her financial prowess to the good of society, and began spending time working on development projects from Chicago to Thailand.

==Advocacy work==
Jayapal founded Hate Free Zone after the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]] as an advocacy group for immigrant groups. Hate Free Zone registered new American citizens to vote and lobbied on immigration reform and related issues. They successfully sued the Bush Administration's Immigration and Naturalization Services to prevent the deportation of over 4,000 Somalis across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weareoneamerica.org/history|title=History {{!}} OneAmerica|website=www.weareoneamerica.org|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group changed its name to OneAmerica in 2008.&lt;ref name="seeks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="change"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2008024796_hatefree30.html|agency=Seattle Times|title=Hate Free Zone gets new name, OneAmerica, With Justice for All|first=Aria|last=Shephard|date=June 30, 2008|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jayapal stepped down from her leadership position in May 2012.

On June 29, 2018, Jayapal participated in [[Women Disobey]] and the sit-in at the [[Hart Senate Office Building]] to protest the Trump administration’s [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump#Zero-tolerance policy and family separation on the Mexico border|“zero-tolerance” approach to illegal immigration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/06/29/women-disobey-protest-washington/|title=Nearly 600 Arrested in Washington #WomenDisobey Protest|last=Reints|first=Renae|date=June 29, 2018|work=Fortune|access-date=July 21, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest resulted in the arrest of over 500 people, including Jayapal. She said she was "proud to have been arrested" for protesting the administration’s "inhumane and cruel" policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/us/politics/womens-march-arrests-dc.html |title=Hundreds Arrested During Women’s Immigration Protest in Washington |last=Niraj |first=Chokshi |date=June 29, 2018 |website= |publisher=New York Times |access-date=July 1, 2018 |quote=On Thursday afternoon, Ms. Jayapal said she was “proud to have been arrested” in protesting the administration’s “inhumane and cruel” policy.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Round-trip engineering''' ('''RTE''') is a functionality of [[software development tools]] that synchronizes two or more related software artifacts, such as, source code, models, configuration files, and even documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gentle|first1=Anne|title=Conversation and Community: The Social Web for Documentation|date=2012|publisher=XML Press|isbn=978-1937434106|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for round-trip engineering arises when the same information is present in multiple artifacts and therefore an inconsistency may occur if not all artifacts are consistently updated to reflect a given change. For example, some piece of information was added to/changed in only one artifact and, as a result, it became missing in/inconsistent with the other artifacts.

Round-trip engineering is closely related to traditional [[software engineering]] disciplines: forward engineering (creating software from specifications), [[reverse engineering]] (creating specifications from existing software), and [[Reengineering (software)|reengineering]] (understanding existing software and modifying it). Round-trip engineering is often wrongly defined as simply supporting both forward and reverse engineering. In fact, the key characteristic of round-trip engineering that distinguishes it from forward and reverse engineering is the ability to synchronize ''existing'' artifacts that evolved ''concurrently'' by ''incrementally'' updating each artifact to reflect changes made to the other artifacts. Furthermore, forward engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the specification is present and reverse engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the software is present. Many reengineering activities can also be understood as RTE when the software is updated to reflect changes made to the previously reverse engineered specification.

Another characteristic of round-trip engineering is ''automatic'' update of the artifacts in response to ''automatically'' detected inconsistencies. In that sense, it is different from forward- and reverse engineering which can be both manual (traditionally) and automatic (via automatic generation or analysis of the artifacts). The automatic update can be either ''instantaneous'' or ''on-demand''. In instantaneous RTE, all related artifacts are immediately updated after each change made to one of them. In on-demand RTE, authors of the artifacts may concurrently evolve the artifacts (even in a distributed setting) and at some point choose to execute matching to identify inconsistencies and choose to propagate some of them and reconcile potential conflicts.

Round trip engineering supports an iterative development process. After you have synchronized your model with revised code, you are still free to choose the best way to work – make further modifications to the code or make changes to your model. You can synchronize in either direction at any time and you can repeat the cycle as many times as necessary.

==Examples of round-trip engineering==
Perhaps the most common form of round-trip engineering is synchronization between UML ([[Unified Modeling Language]]) models and the corresponding source code. Many commercial tools and research prototypes support this form of RTE; a 2007 book lists [[Rational Rose]], [[Borland Together]], [[ESS-Model]], [[BlueJ]], and [[Fujaba]] among those capable, with Fujaba said to be capable to also identify [[design pattern]]s.&lt;ref name="Diehl2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephan Diehl|title=Software Visualization: Visualizing the Structure, Behaviour, and Evolution of Software|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-46505-8|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, UML class diagrams are supported to some degree; however, certain UML concepts, such as ''associations'' and ''containment'' do not have straightforward representations in many programming languages which limits the usability of the created code and accuracy of code analysis (e.g., containment is hard to recognize in the code). A 2005 book on [[Visual Studio]] notes for instance that a common problem in RTE tools is that the model reversed is not the same as the original one, unless the tools are helped by laborious annotations.&lt;ref name="FilevLoton2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Filev|author2=Tony Loton|author3=Kevin McNeish |author4=Ben Schoellmann |author5=John Slater |author6=Chaur G. Wu|title=Professional UML Using Visual Studio .Net|year=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-7645-5875-7|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The behavioral parts of UML impose even more challenges for RTE.

A more tractable form of round-trip engineering is implemented in the context of framework [[application programming interface]]s (APIs), whereby a model describing the usage of a framework API by an application is synchronized with that application's code. In this setting, the API ''prescribes'' all correct ways the framework can be used in applications, which allows precise and complete detection of API usages in the code as well as creation of useful code implementing correct API usages. Two prominent RTE implementations in this category are [[framework-specific modeling language]]s and [[Spring Roo]].

Round-trip engineering is critical for maintaining consistency among multiple models and between the models and the code in [[Object Management Group]]'s (OMG) [[Model-driven architecture]]. OMG proposed the [[QVT]] (query/view/transformation) standard to handle model transformations required for MDA. To date, a few implementations of the standard have been created. (Need to present practical experiences with MDA in relation to RTE).

==Examples in software engineering==
Round-trip engineering based on [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) needs three basic compoments for software development:{{fact|date=January 2018}}

* Source Code Editor;
* UML Editor for the Attributes and Methods;
* Visualisation of UML structure.

An example of basic round-trip engineering is accessible as a web-based Open Source tool is:{{fact|date=January 2018}}

* ''JavaScript Class Creator''&lt;ref&gt;[https://niebert.github.io/JavascriptClassCreator/ JavaScript Class Creator], [[GitHub]].&lt;/ref&gt; allows integrated round-trip engineering for JavaScript Classes. [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] Diagrams are generated with a diagram library JointJS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/clientIO/joint JointJS], [[GitHub]].&lt;/ref&gt; Editing of Javascript Source Code is realized with the editor ACE.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ace.c9.io ACE].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3238">On Monday 21 September 1920 during the night the [[Black and Tans]] sacked the town of [[Balbriggan]] in County Dublin, Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/regionals/fingalindependent/news/the-sack-of-balbriggan-to-be-commemorated-27776467.html|title=The Sack of Balbriggan to be commemorated - Independent.ie|work=Independent.ie|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The sacking was revenge for the killing of [[District Inspector]] Burke and his brother [[Sergeant]] Burke, who were shot dead by the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] while in Smyth’s pub, Balbriggan earlier in the day.

== Sacking ==
The sack started around 11pm when lorries carrying around 100 to 150 Tans arrived in the town from [[Gormanston Camp|Gormanston military barracks]] and proceeded to loot the town.

On Clonard Street, 20 houses were destroyed. Several pubs were looted and burned including Derham’s Pub and McGowan’s Pub on George’s Hill. Overall a factory, 49 houses and four pubs were burnt down.&lt;ref name=coogan/&gt;

Two men, Sean Gibbons and Seamus Lawless, were taken to Quay Street and beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=BxLb0aZOFOMC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;dq=burning+of+balbriggan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinl4D2oeHWAhWKfFAKHZbNARcQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=burning%20of%20balbriggan&amp;f=false|title=Guerrilla Warfare in the Irish War of Independence, 1919–1921|last=McKenna|first=Joseph|date=2011-01-31|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786485192|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
The event caused debate in the British Parliament and [[H. H. Asquith]], the former Prime Minister and then [[leader of the opposition]] compared Balbriggan to a Belgian town on the frontier during [[World War 1|World War I]].&lt;ref name=coogan&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=zWgfwHuOCHYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=burning+of+balbriggan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinl4D2oeHWAhWKfFAKHZbNARcQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=burning%20of%20balbriggan&amp;f=false|title=Ireland In The 20th Century|last=Coogan|first=Tim Pat|date=2009-12-01|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781407097213|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sense of wonder''' is an intellectual and emotional state frequently invoked in discussions of [[science fiction]].

__TOC__

==Definitions==
This entry focuses on one specific use of the phrase "sense of wonder." This phrase is widely used in contexts that have nothing to do with science fiction. The following relates to the use of "sense of wonder" within the context of science fiction. In ''Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction'' the term ''sense of wonder'' is defined as follows:
{{quote|SENSE OF WONDER  ''n''. a feeling of awakening or awe triggered by an expansion of one’s awareness of what is possible or by confrontation with the vastness of space and time, as brought on by reading science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Prucher, Jeff (ed.). ''Brave New Words. The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction'' (Oxford University Press, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}}}

[[Jon Radoff]] has characterised a sense of wonder as an emotional reaction to the reader suddenly confronting, understanding, or seeing a concept new in the context of new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radoff.com/blog/2010/05/27/attack-imagination/ |title=The Attack on Imagination |last=Radoff |first=Jon |date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926222855/http://radoff.com/blog/2010/05/27/attack-imagination/ |archivedate=26 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the introductory section of his essay 'On the Grotesque in Science Fiction', Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr., Professor of English, [[DePauw University]], states:

{{quote|The so-called sense of wonder has been considered one of the primary attributes of sf at least since the pulp era. The titles of the most popular sf magazines of that period—''[[Astounding Science Fiction|Astounding]]'', ''[[Amazing Stories|Amazing]]'', ''[[Wonder Stories]]'', ''Thrilling'', ''Startling'', etc.—clearly indicate that the putative cognitive value of sf stories is more than counter-balanced by an affective power, to which, in fact, the scientific content is expected to submit.&lt;ref name="ronay"&gt;Csicsery-Ronay, Jr., Istvan. 'On the Grotesque in Science Fiction', ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 29, No. 1 (Mar., 2002), pp. 71–99&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|71}}}}

John Clute and [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] associate the experience with that of the "conceptual breakthrough" or "[[paradigm shift]]" (Clute &amp; Nicholls 1993).  In many cases, it is achieved through the recasting of previous narrative experiences in a larger context. It can be found in short scenes (e.g., in ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]'', it can be found, in a small dose, inside the line "That's no moon; it's a space station.") and it can require entire novels to set up (as in the final line to [[Iain Banks]]'s ''[[Feersum Endjinn]]''.)

[[George Mann (writer)|George Mann]] defines the term as “the sense of inspired awe that is aroused in a reader when the full implications of an event or action become realized, or when the immensity of a plot or idea first becomes known;”{{rp|508}} and he associates the term with the [[Golden Age Science Fiction|Golden Age]] of SF and the pulp magazines prevalent at the time. One of the major writers of the Golden Age, Isaac Asimov, agreed with this association: in 1967 commenting on the changes occurring in SF he wrote,

{{quote|And because today’s real life so resembles day-before-yesterday’s fantasy, the old-time fans are restless. Deep within, whether they admit it or not, is a feeling of disappointment and even outrage that the outer world has invaded their private domain. They feel the loss of a “sense of wonder” because what was once truly confined to “wonder” has now become prosaic and mundane.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ‘Forward 1 – The Second Revolution’ in Ellison, Harlan (ed.). ''Dangerous Visions'' (London: Victor Gollancz, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|ix}}}}

==Sense of wonder as numinosity==
{{main article|Numinous}}
Numinous is defined in this encyclopedia as that which arouses "spiritual or religious emotion" or is "mysterious or awe-inspiring".

==Sense of wonder as a concept especially connected with science fiction==

[[George Mann (writer)|George Mann]] suggests that this  ‘sense of wonder’ is associated only with science fiction as distinct from science fantasy, stating:

{{quote|It is this insistence on fundamental realism that has caused [[Jules Verne|Verne]]’s novels to be retrospectively seen as of key importance in the development of SF. …—people in droves came to the books looking for adventure and got it, but with an edge of scientific inquiry that left them with a new, very different sense of wonder. The magic of the realms of fantasy had been superseded by the fascination of speculation rooted in reality.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, George (ed.). ''The Mammoth Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (London: Robinson, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}}}

However, the editor and critic [[David Hartwell]] sees SF’s ‘sense of wonder’ in more general terms, as ”being at the root of the excitement of science fiction.” He continues:

{{quote| Any child who has looked up at the stars at night and thought about how far away they are, how there is no end or outer edge to this place, this universe—any child who has felt the thrill of fear and excitement at such thoughts stands a very good chance of becoming a science fiction reader.}}

To say that science fiction is in essence a religious literature is an overstatement, but one that contains truth. SF is a uniquely modern incarnation of an ancient tradition: the tale of wonder. Tales of miracles, tales of great powers and consequences beyond the experience of people in your neighborhood, tales of the gods who inhabit other worlds and sometimes descend to visit ours, tales of humans traveling to the abode of the gods, tales of the uncanny: all exist now as science fiction.

{{quote|Science fiction’s appeal lies in combination of the rational, the believable, with the miraculous. It is an appeal to the sense of wonder.&lt;ref&gt;Hartwell, David. ''Age of Wonders'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}}}}

Academic criticism of science fiction literature (Robu 1988) identifies the idea of the [[Sublime (literary)|sublime]] described by Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant—infinity, immensity, "delightful horror"—as a key to understanding the concept of "sense of wonder" in science fiction. For example, Professor of English at the [[University of Iowa]], Brooks Landon says:

{{quote|Reference to this “sense of wonder,” a term appropriated and popularized by [[Damon Knight]], appear over and over in twentieth-century discussions of SF and may at least in part reflect SF’s debt to its Gothic and Romantic forerunners.&lt;ref name="landon"&gt;Landon, Brooks. ''Science Fiction after 1900. From the Steam Man to the Stars'' (New York: Twayne, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}}}

[[Edward James (historian)|Edward James]] quotes from [[Brian Aldiss|Aldiss]] and Wingrove’s history of science fiction in support of the above suggestion as to the origin of the ‘sense of wonder’ in SF, as follows:

{{quote| In the Gothic mode, emphasis was placed on the distant and unearthly … Brooding landscapes, isolated castles, dismal old towns, and mysterious figures … carry us into an entranced world from which horrid revelations start …. Terror, mystery and that delightful horror which Burke connected with the sublime … may be discovered … in science fiction to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Aldiss, Brian and David Wingrove (eds.).''Trillion Year Spree'' quoted in James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th Century'' (Oxford University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|103}}}}

Paul K. Alkon in his book ''Science Fiction before 1900. Imagination Discovers Technology'' makes a similar point:

{{quote|The affinities of science fiction and Gothic literature also reveal a common quest for those varieties of pleasing terror induced by awe-inspiring events or settings that Edmund Burke and other eighteenth-century critics call the sublime. A looming problem for writers in the nineteenth century was how to achieve sublimity without recourse to the supernatural. ... The supernatural marvels that had been a staple of epic and lesser forms from Homeric times would no longer do as the best sources of sublimity. ... writers sought new forms that could better accommodate the impact of science.&lt;ref name="alkon"&gt;Alkon, Paul K. ''Science Fiction before 1900. Imagination Discovers Technology'' (New York: Routledge, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}}}

Alkon concludes that "science fiction ever since [the 19th century] has been concerned as often to elicit strong emotional responses as to maintain a rational basis for its plots. Far from being mutually exclusive, the two aims can reinforce each other ...",&lt;ref name="alkon" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

Edward James, in a section of his book entitled ‘The Sense of Wonder’ says on this point of the origin of the 'sense of wonder' in SF:

{{quote|That the concept of the Sublime, a major aesthetic criterion of the Romantic era, has a close connection with the pleasures derived from reading sf has long been recognized by readers and critics, even if that word has seldom been used. The phrase that ''has'' been used, and which to a large extent corresponds, is ‘Sense of Wonder’ (sometimes jocularly or cynically abbreviated to ‘sensawunda’). The very first collection of sf criticism was Damon Knight’s ''In Search of Wonder'' (1956).&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, Edward. ''Science Fiction in the 20th Century'' (Oxford University Press, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}}}}

James goes on to explore the same point as made by David Hartwell in his book ''Age of Wonders'' (and quoted above) as regards the relationship of the ‘sense of wonder’ in SF to religion or the religious experience. He states that,

{{quote| … in doing so, it [science fiction] can create a rival sense of wonder, which acts almost as a replacement religion: a religion for those deprived of all traditional certainties in the wake of Darwin, Einstein, Plank, Godel, and Heisenberg.&lt;ref name="james" /&gt;{{rp|106}}}}

As an example James takes the short story ‘[[The Nine Billion Names of God]]’ by [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. He explains:

{{quote| A computer is installed by Western technicians in a Tibetan lamasery; its task is in to speed up the compilation of all the possible names of God. This, the monks believe, is what the human race was created for, and on its completion the earth, and perhaps all creation, will come to an end. The technicians do their job, with some condescension, and flee back to civilization.

{{quote| ‘Wonder if the computer’s finished its run. It was due about now.’

Chuck didn’t reply, so George swung round in his saddle. He could just see Chuck’s face, a white oval toward the sky.

‘Look,’ whispered Chuck, and George lifted his eyes to heaven. (There is always a last time for everything.)

… what this reader (at the age of 13 or 14) learned from the story was the unimaginable size of the universe and the implausibility of some of the traditional human images of God.

It is appropriate that Edward James chooses a story by Arthur C. Clarke to make the point. One critic is of the opinion that Clarke "has dedicated his career to evoking a "sense of wonder" at the sublime spaces of the universe ..."&lt;ref&gt;Seed, David. 'Introduction' in David Seed (ed.) ''A Companion to Science Fiction'' (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} Editor and SF researcher [[Mike Ashley (writer)|Mike Ashley]] agrees:

{{quote|If there is one writer whose work epitomizes that sense of wonder, it is without doubt, Arthur C. Clarke. It's almost impossible to read any of his stories or novels without experiencing that trigger-moment when the mind expands to take in an awe-inspiring concept. ... It's there in his novel's ''Childhood's End,'' ''The City and the Stars,'' ''Rendezvous with Rama'' and his short stories "The Star", "Jupiter V" and "The Nine Billion Names of God"—possibly the definitive "sense of wonder" story.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Mike.

Kathryn Cramer in her essay ‘On Science and Science Fiction’ also explores the relationship of SF’s ‘sense of wonder’ to religion, stating that “the primacy of the sense of wonder in science fiction poses a direct challenge to religion: Does the wonder of science and the natural world as experienced through science fiction replace religious awe?”
&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Kathryn. ‘Introduction: On Science and Science Fiction,’ in David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer (eds.), ''The Ascent of Wonder. The Evolution of Hard SF'' (London: Orbit, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|28}}

However, as Brooks Landon shows, not all 'sense of wonder' needs to be so closely related to the classical sense of the Sublime. Commenting on the story 'Twilight' by [[John W. Campbell]] he says:
{{quote|... Campbell stresses how long seven million years is in human terms but notes that this time span is nothing in the life of the sun, whose "two thousand thousand thousand" risings ... As Campbell well knew, one sure path to a sense of wonder was big numbers."&lt;ref name="landon"/&gt;{{rp|26–27}}}}

Perhaps the single most famous example of "sensawunda" in all of science fiction involves a [[neologism]], from the work of [[A. E. van Vogt]] (Moskowitz 1974):

{{quote|The word "sevagram" appears only once in the series, as the very last word of ‘[[The Weapon Makers]]’; in its placing, which seems to open universes to the reader's gaze, and in its resonant mysteriousness, for its precise meaning is unclear, this use of "sevagram" may well stand as the best working demonstration in the whole genre sf of how to impart a sense of wonder.&lt;ref&gt;Clute, John and Nicholls, Peter (eds.).''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (New York: St. Martin Griffin, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1269}}}}

Despite the attempts above to define and illustrate the 'sense of wonder' in SF, Csicsery-Ronay Jr. argues that "unlike most of the other qualities regularly associated with the genre, the sense of wonder resists critical commentary."&lt;ref name="ronay"/&gt;{{rp|71}} The reason he suggests is that,

{{quote|A "literature of ideas," as sf is often said to be, invites discussion of ideas; but the sense of wonder seems doubly to resist intellectual investigation. As a "sense," it is clearly not about ideas and indeed seems in opposition to them; wonder even more so, with its implications of awe that short-circuits analytic thought.&lt;ref name="ronay"/&gt;{{rp|71}}}}

Nevertheless, despite this "resistance to critical commentary," the 'sense of wonder' has "a well-established pedigree in art, separated into two related categories of response: the expansive sublime and the intensive grotesque."&lt;ref name="ronay"/&gt;{{rp|71}} Csicsery-Ronay Jr. explains the difference between these two categories as follows::

{{quote| The sublime is a response to an imaginative shock, the complex recoil and recuperation of consciousness coping with objects too great to be encompassed. The grotesque, on the other hand, is a quality usually attributed to objects, the strange conflation of disparate elements not found in nature. This distinction is true to their difference. The sublime expands consciousness inward as it encompasses limits to its outward expansion of apprehension; the grotesque is a projection of fascinated repulsion/attraction out into objects that consciousness cannot accommodate, because the object disturbs the sense of rational, natural categorization. In both cases, the reader/perceiver is shocked by a sudden estrangement from habitual perception, and in both cases the response is to suspend one's confidence in knowledge about the world, and to attempt to redefine the real in thought's relation to nature. Both are concerned with the states of mind that science and art have in common: acute responsiveness to the objects of the world, the testing (often involuntary) of the categories conventionally used to interpret the world, and the desire to articulate what consciousness finds inarticulable.{{rp|71}}}}

Later in this same essay the author argues that "the sublime and the grotesque are in such close kinship that they are shadows of each other," and that "it is not always easy to distinguish the two, and the grotesque of one age easily becomes the sublime of another."&lt;ref name="ronay"/&gt;{{rp|79}} He gives as an example the android (T-1000) in the second '[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]' film ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', saying that "the T-1000, like so many liminal figures in sf, is almost simultaneously sublime and grotesque. Its fascinating shape-shifting would be the object of sublime awe were it not for its sadistic violation of mundane flesh&lt;ref name="ronay"/&gt;{{rp|76}}

There is no doubt that the term 'sense of wonder' is used and understood by readers of SF without the need of explanation or elaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Donald. [http://fanac.org/Fannish_Reference_Works/FandBook/FandBook.html "A Key to the Terminology of science fiction fandom"]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, SF author and critic [[David Langford]] reviewing an SF novel in the [[New York Review of Science Fiction]] was able to write "I suppose it's all a frightfully mordant microcosm of human aspirations, but after so much primitive carnage, the expected multiversal sense-of-wonder jolt comes as a belated infodump rather than ..."&lt;ref&gt;Langford, David.

[[Jack Williamson]] in 1991 said that the [[New Wave (science fiction)|New Wave]] did not last in science fiction because it "failed to move people. I'm not sure if this failure was due to its pessimistic themes or to people feeling the stuff was too pretentious. But it never really grabbed hold of people's imaginations".&lt;ref&gt;Larry McCaffery and Jack Williamson.

''The Artificial Paradise: Science Fiction and American Reality'' (Ann Arbor: U of Michigan P, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; explores science-fiction's (SF) 'sense of wonder' from a feminist perspective. Her book is a "thought-provoking work of criticism that provides a new and interesting perspective on some basic elements in science fiction," including the 'sense of wonder'.&lt;ref name="dalgleish"&gt;Dalgleish, David. Book review: 'The ambivalent paradise: Or, nature and the transcendent in British SF,' review of ''The Artificial Paradise'' by Sharona Ben-Tov', ''Extrapolation'' Kent: Winter 1997.Vol. 38, Iss. 4; pg. 327&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|327}} In his review of Ben-Tov’s work for the SF critical journal ''Extrapolation'' David Dalgleish, quoting from the text, points out that,

{{quote| Ben-Tov asserts that SF's (in)famous "sense of wonder" is an attempt to evoke a sublime transcendence, achieved through Nature, and "Nature is an animate, feminine, and numinous being" (23). But in SF as Ben-Tov sees it, this natural transcendence is merely an illusion; in fact, the transcendent is only achieved through technology, achieved by alienating feminine Nature. SF has "appropriated the qualities of abundance and harmony from the romance's Earthly paradise, banishing the figure of feminine nature from the man-made, rationalized world ...(22) ... The SF ideology that Ben-Tov examines is rooted in the scientific revolution, in the changing view of nature—from living, feminine Mother, Nature becomes inert, dead matter. This twentieth-century ideology has, for Ben-Tov, disturbing implications, especially from a feminist standpoint. "Our society," writes Ben-Tov, "lost the basis for transcendent experience by losing the relationship with numinous nature"(23). Thus, SF's "sense of wonder" is a lie: "it reflects white American fantasies about nature, machines, and the `frontier' . . . . The American mythological apparatus must be comprehended thoroughly to be handled, or dismantled, effectively" (92–93).&lt;ref name="dalgleish"/&gt;{{rp|327}}}}

==Examples of the 'casual' use of the term 'sense of wonder' in science fiction criticism==
*"Most science fiction writers wish to make their readers feel the thrill, the sense of wonder, that so marked SF's youth that the genre still claims it as a sort of trademark, even though it is scarcely to be found today." [[Tom Easton]]. [[Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact]]. New York: May 2000. Vol. 120, Iss.5; page. 134
*"The backstory. Two previous Mars expeditions have failed. ... An American crew perished further south, leaving an empty base ... and return vehicle, the Dulcinea. ... Now it's the turn of the international free-lancers ...The landing is successful, right on target and just a few minute' stroll from the Dulcinea. Sense of wonder oozes from the pages as the crew steps onto the Martian surface." Tom Easton. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Jan 2001. Vol. 121, Iss. 1; page. 135
*"I first read Thrust Into Space by Maxwell W. Hunter II 30 years ago when I was around 11 or 12. At a time when I was just discovering real science fiction, and first reading the works of Heinlein, Asimov, and Clarke, this book evoked for me exactly the same " sense of wonder" as did the works of that great trinity." Jeffrey D Kooistra. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Jul/Aug 2002. Vol. 122, Iss. 7/8; page. 128
*"The story is also far less melodramatic than it might have been if published during the 1950s. Included are brief discussions of mathematical and other scientific problems that evoke a kind of old-fashioned sense of wonder about the universe without disrupting the flow of the story." [[Don D'Ammassa]]. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: May 2009. Vol. 129, Iss. 5; page.101
*David E. Nye brings a keen eye to the history of technology in the United States. I used his American Technological Sublime in classes for years. I may well use his latest ... too. ... The thesis of the earlier book was—in extreme brief—that in America technological wonders—from railroads to the nuclear bomb—evoked the same emotional response as natural wonders such as the Grand Canyon. This response was the blend of awe and terror and wonder that had long been called "the sublime." There was, to me, a clear connection to the sfnal "sense of wonder" that helped explain why twentieth-century science fiction was predominantly American." Tom Easton. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Jun 2005. Vol. 125, Iss. 6; pg. 136
*"The sense of wonder that marks the SF sensibility is hard to teach and certainly cannot be dictated or overlain on a soul that lacks it. It must come from within, and when it does, all the wonders of the universe are within reach." Tom Easton. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Dec 1998. Vol. 118, Iss. 12; pg. 133
*"...if we take note of [[Stanley Kubrick|Kubrick's]] (and Clarke's) film [[2001: A Space Odyssey]], a powerful meditation on the relations of the sublime and the banal. To get into space we seem to have needed to suspend the imagination and sense of wonder that was a very important part of what made us want to get into space in the first place.

[[Richard A. Lovett]]. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Apr 2006. Vol. 126, Iss. 4; page. 89
*"The best writers observe things. Sometimes these are details about the universe. Sometimes they are grand visions that instill the sense of wonder about which science fiction fans wax lyrical. Other times, the observations take the form of details about people or the lives we live: overlooked realities that ring true as they float across the page before us." Richard A Lovett. Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Jan/Feb 2010. Vol. 130, Iss. 1/2; page. 56
*"It was that vision of exciting new technologies and the bright tomorrows they might create that gave us the "sense of wonder" veteran fans lament with such nostalgia. It made us the unhonored prophets of a new faith, lonely pioneers in a world of critical unbelievers bewildered by the term "science fiction. " Fellow fans were rare, and we found one another with feelings of instant kinship." [[Jack Williamson]]. 'Recollections of Analog,' Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact. New York: Jan 2000.

{{Redirect|Sequential|the manual transmission|Sequential manual transmission|other uses|Sequence (disambiguation)}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''sequence''' is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed.  Like a [[Set (mathematics)|set]], it contains [[Element (mathematics)|members]] (also called ''elements'', or ''terms'').  The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the ''length'' of the sequence.  Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and order matters.  Formally, a sequence can be defined as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is either the set of the [[natural number]]s (for infinite sequences) or the set of the first ''n'' natural numbers (for a sequence of finite length ''n'').  The position of an element in a sequence is its ''rank'' or ''index''; it is the natural number from which the element is the image. It depends on the context or a specific convention, if the first element has index 0 or 1.  When a symbol has been chosen for denoting a sequence, the ''n''th element of the sequence is denoted by this symbol with ''n'' as subscript; for example, the ''n''th element of the [[Fibonacci sequence]] is generally denoted ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter 'M' first and 'Y' last.  This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y).  Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence.  Sequences can be ''[[finite set|finite]]'', as in these examples, or ''[[Infinite set|infinite]]'', such as the sequence of all [[even and odd numbers|even]] [[positive integer]]s (2, 4, 6, ...).  In [[computing]] and [[computer science]], finite sequences are sometimes called [[string (computer science)|strings]], [[word (mathematics)|words]] or [[list (computer science)|lists]], the different names commonly corresponding to different ways to represent them in [[computer memory]]; infinite sequences are called [[stream (computing)|streams]].  The empty sequence&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) is included in most notions of sequence, but may be excluded depending on the context.
[[Image:Cauchy sequence illustration2.svg|right|thumb|350px|An infinite sequence of [[real number]]s (in blue).  This sequence is neither increasing, decreasing, convergent, nor [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy]].  It is, however, bounded.]]

==Examples and notation==
A sequence can be thought of as a list of elements with a particular order.  Sequences are useful in a number of mathematical disciplines for studying [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], [[Space (mathematics)|spaces]], and other mathematical structures using the [[#Limits and convergence|convergence]] properties of sequences.  In particular, sequences are the basis for [[series (mathematics)|series]], which are important in [[differential equations]] and [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]].  Sequences are also of interest in their own right and can be studied as patterns or puzzles, such as in the study of [[prime number]]s.

There are a number of ways to denote a sequence, some of which are more useful for specific types of sequences.  One way to specify a sequence is to list the elements.  For example, the first four odd numbers form the sequence (1, 3, 5, 7).  This notation can be used for infinite sequences as well.  For instance, the infinite sequence of positive odd integers can be written (1, 3, 5, 7, ...).  Listing is most useful for infinite sequences with a [[pattern]] that can be easily discerned from the first few elements.  Other ways to denote a sequence are discussed after the examples.

===Examples===
[[File:Fibonacci blocks.svg|thumb|A [[Tessellation|tiling]] with squares whose sides are successive Fibonacci numbers in length.]]

The [[prime number]]s are the [[natural numbers]] bigger than 1 that have no [[divisor]]s but 1 and themselves.  Taking these in their natural order gives the sequence (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).  The prime numbers are widely used in [[mathematics]] and specifically in [[number theory]].

The [[Fibonacci numbers]] are the integer sequence whose elements are the sum of the previous two elements.  The first two elements are either 0 and 1 or 1 and 1 so that the sequence is (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...).

For a large list of examples of integer sequences, see [http://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Some_Famous_Sequences On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences].

Other examples of sequences include ones made up of [[rational numbers]], [[real number]]s, and [[complex numbers]].  The sequence (.9, .99, .999, .9999, ...) approaches the number 1.  In fact, every real number can be written as the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of a sequence of rational numbers, e.g. via its [[decimal expansion]].  For instance, [[pi|{{pi}}]] is the limit of the sequence (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ...).  A related sequence is the sequence of decimal digits of {{pi}}, i.e. (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, ...).  This sequence does not have any pattern that is easily discernible by eye, unlike the preceding sequence, which is increasing.

===Indexing===
Other notations can be useful for sequences whose pattern cannot be easily guessed, or for sequences that do not have a pattern such as the digits of [[pi|{{pi}}]].  One such notation is to write down a general formula for computing the ''n''th term as a function of ''n'', enclose it in parentheses, and include a subscript indicating the range of values that ''n'' can take.  For example, in this notation the sequence of even numbers could be written as &lt;math&gt;(2n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  The sequence of squares could be written as &lt;math&gt;(n^2)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  The variable ''n'' is called an [[Indexed family|index]], and the set of values that it can take is called the [[index set]].

It is often useful to combine this notation with the technique of treating the elements of a sequence as variables.  This yields expressions like &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, which denotes a sequence whose ''n''th element is given by the variable &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  For example:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a_1 &amp;= 1\text{st element of }(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N} \\
a_2 &amp;= 2\text{nd element } \\
a_3 &amp;= 3\text{rd element } \\
&amp;\vdots \\
a_{n-1} &amp;= (n-1)\text{th element} \\
a_n &amp;= n\text{th element} \\
a_{n+1} &amp;= (n+1)\text{th element} \\
&amp; \vdots
 \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Note that we can consider multiple sequences at the same time by using different variables; e.g. &lt;math&gt;(b_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; could be a different sequence than &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can even consider a sequence of sequences: &lt;math&gt;((a_{m, n})_{n\in\mathbb N})_{m\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a sequence whose ''m''th term is the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_{m, n})_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.

An alternative to writing the domain of a sequence in the subscript is to indicate the range of values that the index can take by listing its highest and lowest legal values.  For example, the notation &lt;math&gt;(k^2)_{k = 1}^{10}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the ten-term sequence of squares &lt;math&gt;(1, 4, 9, ..., 100)&lt;/math&gt;.  The limits &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; are allowed, but they do not represent valid values for the index, only the [[supremum]] or [[infimum]] of such values, respectively.  For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n = 1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, and does not contain an additional term "at infinity".  The sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n = -\infty}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is a '''bi-infinite sequence''', and can also be written as &lt;math&gt;(..., a_{-1}, a_0, a_1, a_2, ...)&lt;/math&gt;.

In cases where the set of indexing numbers is understood, the subscripts and superscripts are often left off.  That is, one simply writes &lt;math&gt;(a_k)&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary sequence.  Often, the index ''k'' is understood to run from 1 to ∞.  However, sequences are frequently indexed starting from zero, as in
:&lt;math&gt;(a_k)_{k=0}^\infty = ( a_0, a_1, a_2, ... ).&lt;/math&gt;
In some cases the elements of the sequence are related naturally to a sequence of integers whose pattern can be easily inferred.  In these cases the index set may be implied by a listing of the first few abstract elements.  For instance, the sequence of squares of [[odd number]]s could be denoted in any of the following ways.

* &lt;math&gt;(1, 9, 25, ...)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_3, a_5, ...), \qquad a_k = k^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a_{2k-1})_{k=1}^\infty, \qquad a_k = k^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(a_{k})_{k=1}^\infty, \qquad a_k = (2k-1)^2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;((2k-1)^2)_{k=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, the subscripts and superscripts could have been left off in the third, fourth, and fifth notations, if the indexing set was understood to be the [[natural numbers]].  Note that in the second and third bullets, there is a well-defined sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_{k})_{k=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt;, but it is not the same as the sequence denoted by the expression.

===Defining a sequence by recursion===
Sequences whose elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way are often defined using [[Recursive definition|recursion]].  This is in contrast to the definition of sequences of elements as functions of their positions.

To define a sequence by recursion, one needs a rule to construct each element in terms of the ones before it.  In addition, enough initial elements must be provided so that all subsequent elements of the sequence can be computed by the rule.  The principle of [[mathematical induction]] can be used to [[proof (mathematics)|prove]] that in this case, there is exactly one sequence that satisfies both the recursion rule and the initial conditions.  Induction can also be used to prove properties about a sequence, especially for sequences whose most natural description is recursive.

The [[Fibonacci sequence]] can be defined using a recursive rule along with two initial elements.  The rule is that each element is the sum of the previous two elements, and the first two elements are 0 and 1.
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}&lt;/math&gt;, {{pad|4em}} with {{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;a_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
The first ten terms of this sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.  A more complicated example of a sequence that is defined recursively is Recaman's sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OEIS|1=A005132|2=Recamán's sequence|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  We can define Recaman's sequence by
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n-1} - n&lt;/math&gt;, if the result is positive and not already in the list.  Otherwise, &lt;math&gt;a_n = a_{n-1} + n&lt;/math&gt;.

Not all sequences can be specified by a rule in the form of an equation, recursive or not, and some can be quite complicated.  For example, the sequence of [[prime number]]s is the set of prime numbers in their natural order, i.e. (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).

Many sequences have the property that each element of a sequence can be computed from the previous element.  In this case, there is some function ''f'' such that for all ''n'', &lt;math&gt;a_{n+1} = f(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Formal definition and basic properties==
There are many different notions of sequences in mathematics, some of which (''e.g.'', [[exact sequence]]) are not covered by the definitions and notations introduced below.

===Formal definition===
For the purposes of this article, we define a sequence to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] whose domain is an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] of [[integers]].  This definition covers several different uses of the word "sequence", including one-sided infinite sequences, bi-infinite sequences, and finite sequences (see below for definitions).  However, many authors use a narrower definition by requiring the domain of a sequence to be the set of [[natural numbers]].  The narrower definition has the disadvantage that it rules out finite sequences and bi-infinite sequences, both of which are usually called sequences in standard mathematical practice.   In some contexts, to shorten exposition, the [[codomain]] of the sequence is fixed by context, for example by requiring it to be the set '''R''' of real numbers,&lt;ref name="Gaughan" /&gt; the set '''C''' of complex numbers,&lt;ref name=Saff&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fundamentals of Complex Analysis|chapter=Chapter 2.1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVsZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=saff+%26+Snider&amp;dq=saff+%26+Snider&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rT7PUPaiL4OE2gXvg4GoBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw

Although sequences are a type of function, they are usually distinguished notationally from functions in that the input is written as a subscript rather than in parentheses, i.e. ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' rather than ''f''(''n'').  There are terminological differences as well: the value of a sequence at the input 1 is called the "first element" of the sequence, the value at 2 is called the "second element", etc.  Also, while a function abstracted from its input is usually denoted by a single letter, e.g. ''f'', a sequence abstracted from its input is usually written by a notation such as &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in A}&lt;/math&gt;, or just as &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt;.  Here ''A'' is the domain, or index set, of the sequence.

Sequences and their limits (see below) are important concepts for studying topological spaces.  An important generalization of sequences is the concept of [[net (mathematics)|nets]].  A '''net''' is a function from a (possibly [[uncountable]]) [[directed set]] to a topological space.  The notational conventions for sequences normally apply to nets as well.

===Finite and infinite===
{{See also|ω-language}}
The '''length''' of a sequence is defined as the number of terms in the sequence.

A sequence of a finite length ''n'' is also called an [[n-tuple|''n''-tuple]].  Finite sequences include the '''empty sequence'''&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;) that has no elements.

{{anchor|Doubly infinite|Doubly-infinite sequences}}
Normally, the term ''infinite sequence'' refers to a sequence that is infinite in one direction, and finite in the other—the sequence has a first element, but no final element.  Such a sequence is called a '''singly infinite sequence''' or a '''one-sided infinite sequence''' when disambiguation is necessary.  In contrast, a sequence that is infinite in both directions—i.e. that has neither a first nor a final element—is called a '''bi-infinite sequence''', '''two-way infinite sequence''', or '''doubly infinite sequence'''.  A function from the set '''Z''' of ''all'' [[integers]] into a set, such as for instance the sequence of all even integers ( …, −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8… ), is bi-infinite.  This sequence could be denoted &lt;math&gt;(2n)_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Increasing and decreasing===
A sequence is said to be ''[[monotonically increasing]]'', if each term is greater than or equal to the one before it.  For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; is monotonically increasing if and only if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\geq&lt;/math&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n'' ∈ '''N'''.  If each consecutive term is strictly greater than (&gt;) the previous term then the sequence is called '''strictly monotonically increasing'''.  A sequence is '''monotonically decreasing''', if each consecutive term is less than or equal to the previous one, and '''strictly monotonically decreasing''', if each is strictly less than the previous.  If a sequence is either increasing or decreasing it is called a '''monotone''' sequence.  This is a special case of the more general notion of a [[monotonic function]].

The terms '''nondecreasing''' and '''nonincreasing''' are often used in place of ''increasing'' and ''decreasing'' in order to avoid any possible confusion with ''strictly increasing'' and ''strictly decreasing'', respectively.

===Bounded===
If the sequence of real numbers (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is such that all the terms are less than some real number ''M'', then the sequence is said to be '''bounded from above'''.  In other words, this means that there exists ''M'' such that for all ''n'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''M''.  Any such ''M'' is called an ''upper bound''.  Likewise, if, for some real ''m'', ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≥ ''m'' for all ''n'' greater than some ''N'', then the sequence is '''bounded from below''' and any such ''m'' is called a ''lower bound''.  If a sequence is both bounded from above and bounded from below, then the sequence is said to be '''bounded'''.

===Subsequences===
A '''[[subsequence]]''' of a given sequence is a sequence formed from the given sequence by deleting some of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.  For instance, the sequence of positive even integers (2, 4, 6, ...) is a subsequence of the positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...).  The positions of some elements change when other elements are deleted.  However, the relative positions are preserved.

Formally, a subsequence of the sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)_{n\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; is any sequence of the form &lt;math&gt;(a_{n_k})_{k\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(n_k)_{k\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers.

===Other types of sequences===
Some other types of sequences that are easy to define include:
* An '''[[integer sequence]]''' is a sequence whose terms are integers.
* A '''[[polynomial sequence]]''' is a sequence whose terms are polynomials.
* A positive integer sequence is sometimes called '''multiplicative''', if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''nm''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; for all pairs ''n'', ''m'' such that ''n'' and ''m'' are [[coprime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lectures on generating functions|last=Lando|first=Sergei K.|publisher=AMS|ISBN=0-8218-3481-9|chapter=7.4 Multiplicative sequences}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other instances, sequences are often called ''multiplicative'', if ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''na''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''n''.  Moreover, a ''multiplicative'' Fibonacci sequence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0020739031000158362|title=Fibonacci's multiplicative sequence|first=Sergio|last=Falcon|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology|volume=34|issue=2|pages=310–315|doi=10.1080/0020739031000158362}}&lt;/ref&gt; satisfies the recursion relation ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−2&lt;/sub&gt;.
* A [[binary sequence]] is a sequence whose terms have one of two discrete values, e.g. [[base 2]] values (0,1,1,0, ...) , a series of coin tosses (Heads/Tails) H,T,H,H,T, ..., the answers to a set of True or False questions (T, F, T, T, ...), and so on.

==Limits and convergence==
{{Main|Limit of a sequence}}

[[File:Converging Sequence example.svg|320px|thumb|The plot of a convergent sequence (''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'') is shown in blue.  From the graph we can see that the sequence is converging to the limit zero as ''n'' increases.]]

An important property of a sequence is ''convergence''.  If a sequence converges, it converges to a particular value known as the ''limit''. If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is '''convergent'''. A sequence that does not converge is '''divergent'''.

Informally, a sequence has a limit if the elements of the sequence become closer and closer to some value &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; (called the limit of the sequence), and they become and remain ''arbitrarily'' close to &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that given a real number &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; greater than zero, all but a finite number of the elements of the sequence have a distance from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; less than &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.  

For example, the sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n = \frac{n+1}{2n^2}&lt;/math&gt; shown to the right converges to the value 0. On the other hand, the sequences &lt;math&gt;b_n = n^3&lt;/math&gt; (which begins 1, 8, 27, &amp;hellip;) and &lt;math&gt;c_n = (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt; (which begins -1, 1, -1, 1, &amp;hellip;) are both divergent. 

If a sequence converges, then the value it converges to is unique.  This value is called the '''limit''' of the sequence.  The limit of a convergent sequence &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is normally denoted &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a divergent sequence, then the expression &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n&lt;/math&gt; is meaningless.

=== Formal definition of convergence===

A sequence of real numbers &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; '''converges to''' a real number &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; if, for all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a natural number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;n \geq N&lt;/math&gt; we have&lt;ref name="Gaughan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to Analysis |last=Gaughan |first=Edward |publisher=AMS (2009)|ISBN=0-8218-4787-2|chapter=1.1 Sequences and Convergence}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;|a_n - L| &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of complex numbers rather than a sequence of real numbers, this last formula can still be used to define convergence, with the provision that &lt;math&gt;|\cdot|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the complex modulus, i.e. &lt;math&gt;|z| = \sqrt{z^*z}&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of points in a [[metric space]], then the formula can be used to define convergence, if the expression &lt;math&gt;|a_n-L|&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by the expression &lt;math&gt;\text{dist}(a_n, L)&lt;/math&gt;, which denotes the [[Metric (mathematics)|distance]] between &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

===Applications and important results===
If &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b_n)&lt;/math&gt; are convergent sequences, then the following limits exist, and can be computed as follows:&lt;ref name="Gaughan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/Sequences.aspx |title=Series and Sequences |last1=Dawikins |first1=Paul |work=Paul's Online Math Notes/Calc II (notes) |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n \pm b_n) = \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n \pm \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} c a_n = c \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n b_n) = \left( \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n \right) \left( \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{a_n} {b_n} = \frac{ \lim \limits_{n\to\infty} a_n}{ \lim \limits_{n\to\infty} b_n}&lt;/math&gt;, provided that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} b_n \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

* If a sequence is [[#Bounded|bounded]] and [[#Increasing and decreasing|monotonic]] then it is convergent.
* A sequence is convergent if and only if all of its subsequences are convergent.

===Cauchy sequences===
{{Main|Cauchy sequence}}

[[File:Cauchy sequence illustration.svg|350px|thumb| The plot of a Cauchy sequence (''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), shown in blue, as ''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' versus ''n''.  In the graph the sequence appears to be converging to a  limit as the distance between consecutive terms in the sequence gets smaller as ''n'' increases.  In the [[real number]]s every Cauchy sequence converges to some limit.]]

A Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms become arbitrarily close together as n gets very large.  The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in [[metric spaces]], and, in particular, in [[real analysis]].  One particularly important result in real analysis is ''Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences'':
:A sequence of real numbers is convergent (in the reals) if and only if it is Cauchy.
In contrast, there are Cauchy sequences of [[rational numbers]] that are not convergent in the rationals, e.g. the sequence defined by
''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = {{sfrac|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1=2|2=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}|2=2}}
is Cauchy, but has no rational limit, cf. [[Cauchy sequence#Counter-example: rational numbers|here]].  More generally, any sequence of rational numbers that converges to an [[irrational number]] is Cauchy, but not convergent when interpreted as a sequence in the set of rational numbers.

Metric spaces that satisfy the Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences are called [[complete metric space]]s and are particularly nice for analysis.

=== Infinite limits ===

In calculus, it is common to define notation for sequences which do not converge in the sense discussed above, but which instead become and remain arbitrarily large, or become and remain arbitrarily negative.  If &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; becomes arbitrarily large as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we write
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = \infty.&lt;/math&gt;
In this case we say that the sequence '''diverges''', or that it '''converges to infinity'''. An example of such a sequence is {{nowrap|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''}}.

If &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; becomes arbitrarily negative (i.e. negative and large in magnitude) as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, we write
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;
and say that the sequence '''diverges''' or '''converges to negative infinity'''.

==Series==
{{Main|Series (mathematics)}}
A '''series''' is, informally speaking, the sum of the terms of a sequence.  That is, it is an expression of the form &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;a_1 + a_2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;(a_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of real or complex numbers.  The '''partial sums''' of a series are the expressions resulting from replacing the infinity symbol with a finite number, i.e. the ''N''th partial sum of the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is the number
:&lt;math&gt;S_N = \sum_{n = 1}^N a_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_N. &lt;/math&gt;
The partial sums themselves form a sequence &lt;math&gt;(S_N)_{N\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, which is called the '''sequence of partial sums''' of the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;.  If the sequence of partial sums converges, then we say that the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; is '''convergent''', and the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{N\to\infty} S_N&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''value''' of the series.  The same notation is used to denote a series and its value, i.e. we write &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n = 1}^\infty a_n = \lim_{N\to\infty} S_N&lt;/math&gt;.

==Use in other fields of mathematics==

===Topology===
Sequences play an important role in topology, especially in the study of [[metric spaces]].  For instance:
* A [[metric space]] is [[compact space|compact]] exactly when it is [[sequential compactness|sequentially compact]].
* A function from a metric space to another metric space is [[continuous function|continuous]] exactly when it takes convergent sequences to convergent sequences.
* A metric space is a [[connected space]] if and only if, whenever the space is partitioned into two sets, one of the two sets contains a sequence converging to a point in the other set.
* A [[topological space]] is [[separable space|separable]] exactly when there is a dense sequence of points.

Sequences can be generalized to [[net (mathematics)|nets]] or [[filter (mathematics)|filters]].  These generalizations allow one to extend some of the above theorems to spaces without metrics.

====Product topology====
The [[product topology|topological product]] of a sequence of topological spaces is the [[cartesian product]] of those spaces, equipped with a [[natural topology]] called the [[product topology]].

More formally, given a sequence of spaces &lt;math&gt;(X_i)_{i\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, the product space

:&lt;math&gt;X := \prod_{i\in\mathbb N} X_i, &lt;/math&gt;

is defined as the set of all sequences &lt;math&gt;(x_i)_{i\in\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; such that for each ''i'', &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; is an element of &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;.  The '''[[projection (set theory)|canonical projections]]''' are the maps ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''X'' &amp;rarr; ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' defined by the equation &lt;math&gt;p_i((x_j)_{j\in\mathbb N}) = x_i&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the '''product topology''' on ''X'' is defined to be the [[coarsest topology]] (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections ''p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[continuous (topology)|continuous]].  The product topology is sometimes called the '''Tychonoff topology'''.

===Analysis===
In [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], when talking about sequences, one will generally consider sequences of the form
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots)\text{ or }(x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots)&lt;/math&gt;
which is to say, infinite sequences of elements indexed by [[natural number]]s.

It may be convenient to have the sequence start with an index different from 1 or 0.  For example, the sequence defined by ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1/[[logarithm|log]](''n'') would be defined only for ''n'' ≥ 2.  When talking about such infinite sequences, it is usually sufficient (and does not change much for most considerations) to assume that the members of the sequence are defined at least for all indices [[large enough]], that is, greater than some given ''N''.

The most elementary type of sequences are numerical ones, that is, sequences of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers.  This type can be generalized to sequences of elements of some [[vector space]].  In analysis, the vector spaces considered are often [[function space]]s.  Even more generally, one can study sequences with elements in some [[topological space]].

====Sequence spaces====
{{main|Sequence space}}
A [[sequence space]] is a [[vector space]] whose elements are infinite sequences of [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers.  Equivalently, it is a [[function space]] whose elements are functions from the [[natural numbers]] to the field '''K''', where '''K''' is either the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers.  The set of all such functions is naturally identified with the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in '''K''', and can be turned into a [[vector space]] under the operations of [[pointwise addition]] of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication.  All sequence spaces are [[linear subspace]]s of this space.  Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], or at least the structure of a [[topological vector space]].

The most important sequences spaces in analysis are the ℓ&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces, consisting of the ''p''-power summable sequences, with the ''p''-norm.  These are special cases of [[Lp space|L&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces]] for the [[counting measure]] on the set of natural numbers.  Other important classes of sequences like convergent sequences or [[#c and c0|null sequence]]s form sequence spaces, respectively denoted ''c'' and ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with the sup norm.  Any sequence space can also be equipped with the [[topology]] of [[pointwise convergence]], under which it becomes a special kind of [[Fréchet space]] called an [[FK-space]].

===Linear algebra===
Sequences over a field may also be viewed as [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] in a [[vector space]].  Specifically, the set of ''F''-valued sequences (where ''F'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]]) is a [[function space]] (in fact, a [[product space]]) of ''F''-valued functions over the set of natural numbers.

===Abstract algebra===
Abstract algebra employs several types of sequences, including sequences of mathematical objects such as groups or rings.

====Free monoid====
{{Main|Free monoid}}
If ''A'' is a set, the [[free monoid]] over ''A'' (denoted ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, also called [[Kleene star]] of ''A'') is a [[monoid]] containing all the finite sequences (or strings) of zero or more elements of ''A'', with the binary operation of concatenation.  The [[free semigroup]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the subsemigroup of ''A''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; containing all elements except the empty sequence.

====Exact sequences====
{{Main|Exact sequence}}
In the context of [[group theory]], a sequence
:&lt;math&gt;G_0 \;\xrightarrow{f_1}\; G_1 \;\xrightarrow{f_2}\; G_2 \;\xrightarrow{f_3}\; \cdots \;\xrightarrow{f_n}\; G_n&lt;/math&gt;
of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[group homomorphism]]s is called '''exact''', if the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] (or [[Range (mathematics)|range]]) of each homomorphism is equal to the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the next:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}(f_k) = \mathrm{ker}(f_{k+1})&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the sequence of groups and homomorphisms may be either finite or infinite.

A similar definition can be made for certain other [[algebraic structure]]s.  For example, one could have an exact sequence of [[vector space]]s and [[linear map]]s, or of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] and [[module homomorphism]]s.

====Spectral sequences====
{{Main|Spectral sequence}}
In [[homological algebra]] and [[algebraic topology]], a '''spectral sequence''' is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations.  Spectral sequences are a generalization of [[exact sequence]]s, and since their introduction by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Jean Leray|first=Jean|last=Leray|year=1946}}, they have become an important research tool, particularly in [[homotopy theory]].

===Set theory===
An [[Order topology#Ordinal-indexed sequences|ordinal-indexed sequence]] is a generalization of a sequence.  If α is a [[limit ordinal]] and ''X'' is a set, an α-indexed sequence of elements of ''X'' is a function from α to ''X''.  In this terminology an ω-indexed sequence is an ordinary sequence.

===Computing===
[[Automata theory|Automata]] or [[finite state machine]]s can typically be thought of as directed graphs, with edges labeled using some specific alphabet, Σ.  Most familiar types of automata transition from state to state by reading input letters from Σ, following edges with matching labels; the ordered input for such an automaton forms a sequence called a ''word'' (or input word).  The sequence of states encountered by the automaton when processing a word is called a ''run''.  A [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic automaton]] may have unlabeled or duplicate out-edges for any state, giving more than one successor for some input letter.  This is typically thought of as producing multiple possible runs for a given word, each being a sequence of single states, rather than producing a single run that is a sequence of sets of states; however, 'run' is occasionally used to mean the latter.

===Streams===
Infinite sequences of [[numerical digit|digits]] (or [[character (computing)|characters]]) drawn from a [[finite set|finite]] [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] are of particular interest in [[theoretical computer science]].  They are often referred to simply as ''sequences'' or ''[[Stream (computing)|streams]]'', as opposed to finite ''[[String (computer science)#Formal theory|strings]]''.  Infinite binary sequences, for instance, are infinite sequences of [[bit]]s (characters drawn from the alphabet {0, 1}).  The set ''C'' = {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; of all infinite binary sequences is sometimes called the [[Cantor space]].

An infinite binary sequence can represent a [[formal language]] (a set of strings) by setting the ''n''&amp;thinsp;th bit of the sequence to 1 if and only if the ''n''&amp;thinsp;th string (in [[shortlex order]]) is in the language.  This representation is useful in the [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonalization method]] for proofs.&lt;ref name=Oflazer2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oflazer|first1=Kemal|title=FORMAL LANGUAGES, AUTOMATA AND COMPUTATION: DECIDABILITY|url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/ko/pdfs/lecture-15.pdf|website=cmu.edu|publisher=Carnegie-Mellon University|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seriousness''' (noun; adjective: '''''serious''''') is an attitude of [[gravitas|gravity]], [[:wikt:solemnity|solemnity]], persistence, and [[:wikt:earnest|earnest]]ness toward something considered to be of [[importance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Seriousness ''Seriousness'', The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some notable philosophers and commentators have criticised excessive seriousness, while others have praised it.&lt;ref name=PSB&gt;''The Puritans: A Sourcebook of Their Writings'', Perry Miller, Thomas Herbert Johnson, p. 59, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-fBB7uGjYoC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=puritanism+seriousness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qzRHytADSW&amp;sig=RG6-211MUe3bFbUmGHR_HD8WSMY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0OVZTeObI4P2tgO11-WoCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=serious&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''"Spirit of Seriousness"'', The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness'', Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;''Joseph Adler on Seriousness'', Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you- thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HS&gt;''"High Seriousness"'', ''Historicism Once More: Problems and Occasions for the American Scholar'', NOVEL: A Forum on Fiction, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring, 1971), pp. 283–286, Roy Harvey Pearce, George Levine, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1345129]&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness is often contrasted with [[comedy]], as in the [[seriocomedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;''Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, SAMMY and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz'', The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D.

== Philosophical attitudes toward seriousness ==

=== Praise for "high seriousness" in scholarship and poetry ===
Some use "seriousness" as a term of praise for scholarship or in literary review.&lt;ref name=HS/&gt; 19th century [[poet]], [[cultural critic]], and [[literary critic]], [[Matthew Arnold]] said that the most important criteria used to judge the value of a poem were "high truth" and "high seriousness".&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Pater, Wilde, and the Object as in Themselves They See It, Wendell V. Harris, Studies in English Literature, 1500–1900, Vol. 11, No. 4, Nineteenth Century (Autumn, 1971), pp. 733–747&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophical disdain for seriousness ===
Many have expressed an attitude of disdain toward taking things too seriously, as opposed to viewing things with an attitude of humor. Poet, playwright, and philosopher [[Joseph Addison]] said that being serious is dull, "we are growing serious, and let me tell you, that's the next step to being dull."&lt;ref name= JA/&gt;&lt;ref name= JA&gt;Dictionary Quotes.com, [www.dictionary-quotes.com/we-are-growing-serious-and-let-me-tell-you-thats-the-next-step-to-being-dull-addison-joseph/]&lt;/ref&gt; Political satirist [[P.J. O'Rourke]] said that "Seriousness is stupidity sent to college."&lt;ref&gt;[http://quotationsbook.com/quote/35911/ ''P. J. O'Rourke on Seriousness'', Quotations Book]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epigram]]ist, poet, and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] said that "life is too important to be taken seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary-quotes.com/life-is-too-important-to-be-taken-seriously-oscar-wilde/ ''Seriously Oscar Wild", Dictionary of Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt; In a play on words, novelist [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]] indicated that the ''central serious conviction in life'' is that nothing should be taken with too much seriousness, "the one serious conviction that a man should have is that nothing is to be taken too seriously."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famous-quotes.com/topic.php?tid=1109 ''Samuel Butler on Seriousness'', Book of Famous Quotes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[ascetic]] or [[puritan]] religious sects, an attitude of seriousness is always to be taken, and [[solemnity]], [[sobriety]], and puritanism with its hostility to social pleasures and indulgences are the only acceptable attitudes. [[Perry Miller]], "the master of American intellectual history", wrote of excessive seriousness of the [[Puritan]]s, "simple humanity cries at last for some relief from the interminable high seriousness of the Puritan code."&lt;ref name=PSB/&gt;

==== The "spirit of seriousness" in existential philosophy ====
{{Further|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
[[Existentialist]] philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] called the "spirit of seriousness’’ the belief that there is an objective and independent goodness in things for people to discover, and that this belief leads to [[bad faith]]. He argued that people forget that values are not absolute, but are contingent and subjectively determined.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref name=BN/&gt; In Sartre’s words, "the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] ‘'[[:wikt:given|given]]s’’,  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of ‘desirable’ from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution."&lt;ref name=BN/&gt;

== Seriousness and comedy ==
{{Further|Seriocomedy}}
Seriousness is sometimes contrasted with the [[comedy|comical]] in [[humor]]. In the [[performing arts]] and [[literature]], the [[seriocomedy]] is a [[genre]] which blends seriousness with the comical, [[drama]] with [[comedy]].&lt;ref name=JC&gt;Joel Chaston – Baum, Bakhtin, and Broadway: A Centennial Look at the Carnival of Oz, The Lion and the Unicorn – Volume 25, Number 1, January 2001, pp. 128–149, Joel D. Chaston, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/lion_and_the_unicorn/v025/25.1chaston01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Dark Comedy: The Development of Modern Comic Tragedy'', J. L. Styan, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=w1DNaVCV2YgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=seriousness+comedy&amp;ots=Mzl7_hDgkX&amp;sig=wIco2kXThh47fgLYqg2vzSBNVv0#v=onepage&amp;q=seriousness%20comedy&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and detection ==

=== Detecting presence and absence of seriousness in humor ===
{{Further|Theory of humor}}
In the [[theory of humor]], one must have a [[sense of humor]] and a sense of seriousness to distinguish what is supposed to be taken literally or not. An even more keen sense is needed when humor is used to make a serious point.&lt;ref name=SRF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''When Congress makes a joke: Congressional Humor as Serious and Purposeful Communication'', International Journal of Humor Research. Volume 14, Issue 4, Pages 359–394, Nov 2004, Dean L. Yarwood&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have studied how humor is intended to be taken as having seriousness, as when court jesters used humor to convey serious information.&lt;ref name=NSIH&gt;''Negotiating the Serious Import of Humor'', Sociometry, Vol. 32, No. 2 (Jun., 1969), pp. 169–181, Joan P. Emerson&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, when humor is not intended to be taken seriously, [[Taste (sociology)|bad taste]] in humor may cross a line after which it is taken seriously, though not intended.&lt;ref name=NSIH/&gt;

=== Detecting degree of seriousness in developmental psychology ===
{{Further|Educational psychology}}
In [[Developmental psychology]] and [[educational psychology]], seriousness is studied as it relates to how children develop an ability to distinguish levels of seriousness as it relates to transgressions and expenditure of time; for example, a child must learn to distinguish between levels of seriousness in admonitions such as between "don't fidget" and "don't forget to look both ways when crossing the street", which have the same linguistic and normative structure, but different levels of seriousness.&lt;ref name=ST/&gt;&lt;ref name=PMJ&gt;''"regarding the seriousness... their ability to understand the reality-fantasy distinction"'', ''Preschoolers' Moral Judgments: Distinctions Between Realistic and Cartoon-Fantasy Transgressions'', Proceedings of the 2004 conference on Interaction design and children: building a community, 2004, Kristen M. Peters, Fran C. Blumberg&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Measuring degree of seriousness in crime ===
{{Further|Punishment|Felony|Misdemeanor}}
The degree of seriousness of crimes is an important factor relating to crime. One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. A [[felony]] is generally considered to be a crime of "high seriousness", while a [[misdemeanor]] is not.

In [[criminal law]] the degree of seriousness is considered when meting out punishment to fit the crime, and in considering to what extent overcrowded prison facilities will be used.&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice – The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; Seriousness of a crime is a major factor in considerations of the allocation of scarce [[law enforcement]] funds.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminology'', Larry J. Siegel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy'', Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1372651]&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning and measurement of seriousness is a major concern in [[public policy]] considerations.  A quantitative scoring system called the "seriousness score" has been developed for use in allocating law enforcement resources and sentencing.&lt;ref name=OSS/&gt;

As to England and Wales, see section 143 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

=== Medical triage ===
Degrees of seriousness are used in medicine to make decisions about care. Seriousness is related to the effects of delaying or not having medical care. In an emergency hospital, the [[triage]] nurse must evaluate levels of seriousness of medical emergencies and rank them to determine order of care. Seriousness of illness is used to make decisions as to whether to perform invasive procedures such as surgery.

==== Measuring crime seriousness in the media ====
There is a [[positive correlation]] between the degree of seriousness of a crime and viewer ratings of news coverage.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

=== Cultural variation in measurement and detection ===
What is considered serious varies widely across cultures and is studied in [[sociology]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[criminology]]; being of the wrong religious faith may be considered a serious crime in some cultures; smoking marijuana may be a serious crime in some cultures and not others; homosexuality a serious crime in some cultures; and prostitution is a serious crime in some cultures.&lt;ref name=CRCC/&gt; Perception of seriousness is measured in assessing varying cultural perceptions on health risks.&lt;ref&gt;''Explaining Risk Perception: An Evaluation of the Psychometric Paradigm in Risk Perception Research'', Lennart Sjöberg, Bjørg-Elin Moen, Torbjørn Rundmo, [http://www.paul-hadrien.info/backup/LSE/IS%20490/Sjoberg%20Psychometric_paradigm.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual and reproductive health and rights''' or ''SRHR'' is an  of [[human rights]] applied to [[sexuality]] and [[reproduction]]. It is a combination of four fields that in some contexts are more or less distinct from each other, but less so or not at all in other contexts. These four fields are [[sexual health]], [[Universal Declaration of Sexual Rights|sexual rights]], [[reproductive health]] and [[reproductive rights]]. In the concept of SRHR, these four fields are treated as separate but inherently intertwined.

Distinctions between these four fields are not always made. Sexual health and reproductive health are sometimes treated as synonymous to each other, as are sexual rights and reproductive rights. In some cases, sexual rights are included in the term sexual health, or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ippf.org/resource/IPPF-Charter-Sexual-and-Reproductive-Rights|title=IPPF Charter on Sexual and Reproductive Rights Guidelines | date = 22 November 2011 | publisher= IPPF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do different [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) and governments{{cn|date=May 2018}} use different terminologies, but different terminologies are often used within the same organization.

Some of the notable global NGOs that fight for sexual and reproductive health and rights include [[International Planned Parenthood Federation|IPPF]] (International Planned Parenthood Federation), [[ILGA]] (International Lesbian and Gay Alliance), WAS ([[World Association for Sexual Health]] - formerly known as World Association for Sexology), and International HIV/AIDS Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131206105333/http://www.aidsalliance.org/TechnicalThemeDetails.aspx?Id=10 | archive-date = 6 December 2013 | dead-url = yes | title = SRHR and HIV | publisher = International HIV/AIDS Alliance | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110616041715/http://www.eurongos.org/Default.aspx?ID=1495 | archive-date = 16 June 2011 | dead-url = yes | title = Members of EuroNGOs | publisher = EuroNGOs | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual health==
The [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/sexual_health/en/|title=Sexual health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines sexual health as: "Sexual health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality. It requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."

==Sexual rights==
Unlike the other three aspects of SRHR, the struggle for sexual rights include, and focus on, sexual pleasure and emotional sexual expression. One platform for this struggle is the [[World Association for Sexual Health|WAS]] Declaration of Sexual Rights.

The Platform for Action from the [[1995 Beijing Conference on Women]] established that human rights include the right of women freely and without coercion, violence or discrimination, to have control over and make decisions concerning their own sexuality, including their own sexual and reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/beijing/platform/ | title = Beijing Platform for Action, paragraphs 92, 93 and 96 | publisher = United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women | date = September 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This paragraph has been interpreted by some countries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sweden's international policy on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights" | url = http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | website = www.regeringen.se | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140509001157/http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/574/a/61489 | archivedate = 2014-05-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the applicable definition of women’s sexual rights. The UN Commission on Human Rights has established that if women had more power, their ability to protect themselves against violence would be strengthened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/84: The protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-84.doc | date = 21 April 2005 | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 20 April 2005 | title = Human Rights Resolution E/CN.4/RES/2005/41: Elimination of violence against women | url = http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/E/CHR/resolutions/E-CN_4-RES-2005-41.doc | author = The Commission on Human Rights | publisher = The United Nations }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 14th World Congress of Sexology (Hong Kong, 1999), the WAS adopted the [[Declaration of Sexual Rights]], which originally included 11 sexual rights. It was heavily revised and expanded in March 2014 by the WAS Advisory Council to include 16 sexual rights:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsexology.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/declaration_of_sexual_rights_sep03_2014.pdf |title=Declaration of sexual rights' |publisher=Worldsexology.org |date=2014-03-01 |access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This Declaration influenced [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] (which were launched as a set of international principles relating to sexual orientation and gender identity on 26 March 2007), especially on the idea of each person's [[integrity]], and right to sexual and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yogyakartaprinciples.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/A5_yogyakartaWEB-2.pdf | title = The Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity | work = Yogyakartaprinciples.org | date = 10 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the U.S. government said it would begin using the term "sexual rights" in discussions of human rights and global development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/us-government-says-it-will-now-use-the-term-sexual-rights/ar-AAer3sZ?li=AAa0dzB&amp;ocid=HPCDHP |title=US government says it will now use the term 'sexual rights' |publisher=Msn.com |date=2015-06-26 |access-date=2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive health==
{{Main article|Reproductive health}}
Within the framework of the [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) definition of [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, '''reproductive health''', or '''sexual health'''/'''hygiene''', addresses the reproductive processes, functions and system at all stages of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/reproductive_health/en/|title=WHO: Reproductive health|access-date=2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reproductive health, therefore, implies that people are able to have a responsible, satisfying and [[Safer sex|safer sex life]] and that they have the capability to reproduce and the [[Family planning|freedom to decide]] if, when and how often to do so. One interpretation of this implies that men and women ought to be [[sex education|informed]] of and to have access to safe, effective, affordable and acceptable methods of [[birth control]]; also access to appropriate [[reproductive medicine|health care services]] of [[sexual medicine|sexual]], [[reproductive medicine]] and implementation of health education programs to stress the importance of [[maternal health|women to go safely]] through [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]] could provide couples with the best chance of having a healthy infant. On the other hand, individuals do face inequalities in reproductive health services. Inequalities vary based on socioeconomic status, education level, age, ethnicity, religion, and resources available in their environment. It is possible for example, that low income individuals lack the resources for appropriate health services and the knowledge to know what is appropriate for maintaining reproductive health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hall KS, Moreau C, Trussell J | title = Determinants of and disparities in reproductive health service use among adolescent and young adult women in the United States, 2002-2008 | journal = American Journal of Public Health | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 359–67 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22390451 | pmc = 3483992 | doi = 10.2105/ajph.2011.300380 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductive Rights==
{{Main article|Reproductive rights}}
'''Reproductive rights''' are [[legal right]]s and freedoms relating to [[human reproduction|reproduction]] and [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name="Cook_1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = Rebecca J. | last2 = Fathalla | first2 = Mahmoud F. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Advancing Reproductive Rights Beyond Cairo and Beijing|journal=International Family Planning Perspectives | date = September 1996 | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 115 | doi = 10.2307/2950752 | jstor = 2950752 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] defines reproductive rights as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Reproductive rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their children and to have the information and means to do so, and the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health. They also include the right of all to make decisions concerning reproduction free of [[discrimination]], [[coercion]] and [[violence]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://who.int/reproductive-health/gender/index.html|title=Sexual and reproductive health | publisher = World Health Organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Goals and objectives ==
Despite frequent changes to frameworks, overall goals for SRHR remain little changed. As first stipulated at the ICPD, universal reproductive health care remains the ultimate objective, and with each new framework, targets are developed to progress towards this.&lt;ref name="Tangcharoensathien_2015" /&gt; In the original ICPD Program of Action, the primary call was for universal access to healthcare, including reproductive healthcare, family planning and sexual health.&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt; Over time, these have expanded to include the right to access education regarding sexual and reproductive health, an end to [[female genital mutilation]], and increased women's empowerment in social, political, and cultural spheres.&lt;ref name="Glasier_2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fincher_1994" /&gt;

Special goals and targets were also created to address adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs. Adolescents are often the most vulnerable to risks associated with sexual activity, including HIV, due to personal and social issues such as feelings of isolation, child marriage, and stigmatization.&lt;ref name="Hindin_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindin MJ, Fatusi AO | title = Adolescent sexual and reproductive health in developing countries: an overview of trends and interventions | journal = International Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 58–62 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19620089 | doi = 10.1363/ipsrh.35.058.09 | jstor = 40233805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments realized the importance of investing in the health of adolescents as a means of establishing future well-being for their societies.&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandra-Mouli V, Svanemyr J, Amin A, Fogstad H, Say L, Girard F, Temmerman M | title = Twenty years after International Conference on Population and Development: where are we with adolescent sexual and reproductive health and rights? | language = English | journal = The Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 56 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = S1-6 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25528975 | doi = 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2014.09.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the [[Commission on Population and Development]] developed a series of fundamental rights for adolescents including the right to comprehensive sex education, the right to decide all matters related to their sexuality, and access to sexual and reproductive health services without discrimination (including safe abortions wherever legal).&lt;ref name="Chandra-Mouli_2015" /&gt;

[[File:Shugibukuro-example-japan-feb9-2018.jpg|thumb|An example of a shūgi-bukuro.]]

A {{Nihongo|'''''shūgi-bukuro'''''|祝儀袋}} is a special envelope in which [[money]] is given as a gift at [[Marriage in Japan|weddings in Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordenker, Alice, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ek20110621wh.html Kinpū]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 June 2011, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very common in Japan to give a gift of money at weddings. The giver inserts the money into a ''shūgi-bukuro'' on which they have written their name. The ''shūgi-bukuro'' is handed to the receptionist of the [[Wedding reception|reception party]]. ''Shūgi-bukuro'' are sold at supermarkets and stationery stores.

==Amount given==
The amount given in ''shūgi-bukuro'' differs according to the givers relationship to the couple, their social status and the style of venue. In the case of friends or company colleagues, it is usually between [[Yen|¥30,000]] and ¥50,000. In the case of close friends or those in a senior position at the bride or bridegroom’s company, ¥30,000 to ¥50,000 is common, and in the case of relatives, ¥50,000 to ¥100,000 is not unusual.

For married couples that attend the wedding ¥50,000 would be common, as opposed to unmarried couples where each person would give a separate amount say ¥30,000 each.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

It is common to give amounts in which the leading digit(s) form an [[Parity (mathematics)|odd]] number, such as ¥30,000 or ¥50,000, in order to symbolize the fact that the newly married couple cannot be divided. When the leading digit forms an even number, as in ¥20,000, the amount is usually given in an odd number of bills (e.g. 1 x ¥10,000 and 2 x ¥5,000).  Amounts in which the leading digit forms a multiple of 4, such as ¥40,000, are not recommended since the number 4 in Japanese can be [[Pronunciation|pronounced]] as ''[[Shi (kana)|shi]]'' which is the same as the pronunciation of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for [[Japanese_superstitions#Numbers|death]]. Likewise, multiples of 9 are avoided because the pronunciation of this number can mean suffering.

'''Suspension''' is either paid or unpaid  time away from the workplace as ordered by the employer in order for a workplace investigation to take place.

== Workplace ==
Suspension is a common practice in the [[Employment|workplace]] for being in violation of an organization's [[policy]], or major breaches of policy. Work suspensions occur when a business manager or supervisor deems an action of an employee, whether intentional or unintentional, to be a violation of policy that should result in a course of punishment, and when the employee's absence during the suspension period does not affect the company. This form of action hurts the employee because s/he will have no hours of work during the suspended period and therefore will not get paid, unless the suspension is with pay, or is challenged and subsequently overturned. Some jobs, which pay on [[salary]], may have paid suspensions, in which the affected worker will be prevented from coming to work but will still receive pay. Generally, suspensions are deemed most effective if the affected worker remains unpaid. Suspensions are usually given after other means of [[counseling statements]] have been exhausted, but some violations may result in immediate suspension. Suspensions are tracked, and any number of them, even one may prevent one from receiving raises, bonuses or promotions, or could cause [[Dismissal (employment)|dismissal]] from the company.

Suspension clauses are common components of [[collective bargaining]] [[Contract|agreements]]. Suspensions may be challenged by employees in [[Trade union|unionized]] organizations through the filing of a [[grievance (labour)|grievance]].

Suspension on full pay can also be used when an employee needs to be removed from the workplace to avoid prejudicing an investigation. This is used not as a punishment, but in the employer's best interest. For example, a [[police officer]] who shoots a person while on duty will be given a suspension with pay during the investigation, not to punish, but to enable the department to carry out its investigation.

== Sport ==
Suspension is a punishment in [[sport]] where players are banned from playing a certain number of future games. These suspensions may be issued for severe infractions of the rules of play (such as [[personal foul (disambiguation)|personal foul]]s), excessive technical, or flagrant fouls for the duration of a season, fights during the course of the game in which the player was a part of the wrongdoing, or misconduct off the field (such as illegal or banned substance use).

Generally, an athlete who is suspended must forfeit his pay during the course of the suspension, and depending on the team's or league's rules, may not be permitted to don his uniform or be present with the team during the course of play, which often includes attending games in the stands as a typical spectator would.

== Academia ==&lt;!-- [[In-school suspension]] redirects to here --&gt;
{{See also|School discipline}}
In academia, suspension (also known as temporary exclusion) is a mandatory leave assigned to a [[student]] as a form of [[punishment]] that can last anywhere from one [[day]] to several [[week]]s, during which time the student is not allowed to attend regular [[school]] lessons.  

===ISS/In-School Suspension===
In-School Suspension (ISS) or On-Campus suspension (OCS), sometimes known as "internal exclusion/isolation", and by some [[Florida]] schools as "School Center for Special Instruction",&lt;ref name="stateimpact.npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzalez|first= Sarah|url=http://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/2012/05/04/floridas-in-school-suspension-policy-keeps-students-out-of-class/|title=In-School Suspension: a Better Alternative or Waste of Time?|publisher=stateimpact.npr.org|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an alternative setting that removes students from the classroom for a period of time, while requiring students to attend school and complete their work. This form of punishment is often chosen because it provides supervision and structure to the students' days, whereas a student who is given an off-campus suspension receives essentially an unscheduled holiday, as off-campus suspension is widely considered to be nothing more than a pleasant reward to most students, instead of the punishment that it is intended to be, and also gives students more of a reason to misbehave on purpose, to those who would prefer to be suspended out of school, rather than being kept in school. Generally, a student assigned to on-campus suspension spends the entire school day in the designated OCS location, completes work submitted in advance by the student's teachers, and is monitored by school staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandi.net/depts/placement_appeal/discipline_policy/suspension.html Suspension Policy :: San Diego Unified School District] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503113425/http://www.sandi.net/depts/placement_appeal/discipline_policy/suspension.html |date=2008-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One variation of in-school suspension requires the student to arrive at school at a designated time on a Saturday to serve out their punishment, rather than miss class time during the week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murray.spps.org/iss.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080301144623/http://www.murray.spps.org/iss.html |date=March 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of punishment is commonly referred to as "Saturday School" or more commonly, "Saturday Detention", but it may go under other names as well. The name "Saturday School" is also used to indicate [[School punishment#Detention|detention]], a less serious punishment. If a student fails to show up at Saturday School, it might result in a more serious punishment being given to the student.

===OSS/Out of School Suspension===
The student's parents or guardians are usually notified as to the reason for and the duration of the suspension. Sometimes students have to complete work during their suspensions for which they will receive no credit (OSS). Also, upon returning to school, it is often mandatory that the student, his/her parents/guardians, and a school administrator have a meeting to discuss and evaluate the matter.  If the suspension is related to the symptoms of a disability or the student is receiving special education or mental health services, students may be required to consult their case manager, counselor, or school psychologist before and/or after the suspension. In some schools, this meeting is prior to the suspension.&lt;ref&gt;[[Delran High School]] Student-Parent Handbook 2008–2009, page 10 section C #1.&lt;/ref&gt; Applications to some colleges ask the student whether or not they have ever been suspended. In some places in the [[United States]], a suspension is noted on one's [[transcript (education)|transcript]]. However, other places do not report suspensions or are expressly forbidden from doing so under state law. Students who breach a suspension (attend the school while suspended) may be arrested for, and charged with [[trespassing]]. This could result in an extension of suspension, community service, and sometimes jail time. Students who continue to breach a suspension could be sentenced to [[Expulsion (academia)|expulsion]] and longer, more severe punishments. Students are also not allowed to attend after school activities (such as proms, sporting events, etc.) while suspended from school.

== Roman Catholic canon law ==
In Roman Catholic canon law, the censure of suspension prohibits certain acts by a cleric, whether the acts are of a religious character deriving from his [[Holy Orders|ordination]] ("acts of the power of orders") or are exercises of his power of governance or of rights and functions attached to the office he holds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4X.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1333]&lt;/ref&gt;

This censure is automatically applied to a cleric who uses physical violence against a bishop,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P53.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1370]&lt;/ref&gt; a deacon who attempts to celebrate the sacrifice of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] or a priest who, though not empowered to grant sacramental absolution attempts to do so or who hears sacramental confession,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1378]&lt;/ref&gt; a cleric who celebrates a sacrament through [[simony]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1380]&lt;/ref&gt; and on a person who receives ordination illicitly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1383]&lt;/ref&gt;

The censure of suspension (along with other punishments) is to be inflicted also on a cleric who openly lives in violation of chastity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P56.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1395]&lt;/ref&gt; and on any priest who "in the act, on the occasion, or under the pretext of confession" solicits a penitent to a sexual sin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1387]&lt;/ref&gt; Suspension is incurred automatically by any cleric who falsely denounces a priest of having committed this delict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P55.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1390]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable development''' is the [[organizing principle]] for meeting [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] goals while at the same time [[Sustainability|sustaining]] the ability of natural systems to provide the [[natural resource]]s and [[ecosystem services]] upon which the [[economy]] and [[society]] depend. The desired result is a state of society where living conditions and resource use continue to meet human needs without undermining the integrity and stability of the natural system. Sustainable development can be classified as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations.

While the modern concept of sustainable development is derived mostly from the 1987 [[Brundtland Commission|Brundtland Report]], it is also rooted in earlier ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] and twentieth century environmental concerns. As the concept developed, it has shifted to focus more on [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and environmental protection for future generations. It has been suggested that "the term 'sustainability' should be viewed as humanity's target goal of human-ecosystem equilibrium (homeostasis), while 'sustainable development' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Shaker |first=Richard Ross |date=September 2015 |title=The spatial distribution of development in Europe and its underlying sustainability correlations |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0143622815001745 |journal=Applied Geography |volume=63 |pages=&lt;!-- 304–314 --&gt; |at=p. 35 |doi=10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the [[natural resource]]s and [[Ecosystem services|ecosystem]], the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature. Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development, turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good. The economic development brought by such organized principles and practices in an [[economy]] is called Managed Sustainable Development (MSD).

The concept of sustainable development has been—and still is—subject to criticism, including the question of what is to be sustained in sustainable development. It has been argued{{weasel inline|date=October 2018}} that there is no such thing as a sustainable use of a [[non-renewable resource]], since any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to the exhaustion of earth's finite stock. The United Nations organized an international conference in Stockholm, Sweden from 5 to 16 June 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/unchedec.htm|title=Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - A/CONF.48/14/Rev.1 Chapter I - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Environment|first=United Nations Conference on the Human|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Sustainability|History of sustainability}}
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[The Blue Marble]] photograph, taken from [[Apollo 17]] on 7 December 1972, quickly became an icon of [[environmental conservation]].&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt;{{RP|7}}]]
Sustainability can be defined as the practice of maintaining processes of productivity indefinitely—natural or human made—by replacing resources used with resources of equal or greater value without degrading or endangering natural biotic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2014|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5|location=New York|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable development ties together concern for the [[carrying capacity]] of [[Systems ecology|natural systems]] with the social, political, and economic challenges faced by humanity. [[Sustainability science]] is the study of the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science. There is an additional focus on the present generations' responsibility to regenerate, maintain and improve planetary resources for use by future generations.&lt;ref name=Finn-2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Finn|first=Donovan|title=Our Uncertain Future: Can Good Planning Create Sustainable Communities?|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Champaign-Urbana|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|3-8}}

Sustainable development has its roots in ideas about [[sustainable forest management]] which were developed in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref name="Grober2"&gt;Ulrich Grober: Deep roots&amp;nbsp;— A conceptual history of "sustainable development" (Nachhaltigkeit), Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blewitt|first1=John|title=Understanding Sustainable Development|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780415707824|edition=2nd|url=https://www.routledge.com/Understanding-Sustainable-Development-2nd-Edition/Blewitt/p/book/9780415707824|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|6-16}} In response to a growing awareness of the depletion of timber resources in England, [[John Evelyn]] argued that "sowing and planting of trees had to be regarded as a national duty of every landowner, in order to stop the destructive over-exploitation of natural resources" in his 1662 essay ''[[Sylva, or A Discourse of Forest-Trees and the Propagation of Timber|Sylva]]''. In 1713 [[Hans Carl von Carlowitz]], a senior mining administrator in the service of Elector [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus I of Saxony]] published ''Sylvicultura oeconomica'', a 400-page work on forestry. Building upon the ideas of Evelyn and French minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], von Carlowitz developed the concept of managing forests for [[sustained yield]].&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt; His work influenced others, including [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and [[Georg Ludwig Hartig]], eventually leading to the development of a science of forestry. This in turn influenced people like [[Gifford Pinchot]], first head of the [[US Forest Service]], whose approach to forest management was driven by the idea of wise use of resources, and [[Aldo Leopold]] whose [[land ethic]] was influential in the development of the [[environmental movement]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Grober2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt;

Following the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''[[Silent Spring]]'' in 1962, the developing environmental movement drew attention to the relationship between economic growth and development and environmental degradation. [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] in his influential 1966 essay ''The Economics of the Coming Spaceship Earth'' identified the need for the economic system to fit itself to the ecological system with its limited pools of resources.&lt;ref name="Blewitt-2015"/&gt; One of the first uses of the term sustainable in the contemporary sense was by the [[Club of Rome]] in 1972 in its classic report on the ''[[Limits to Growth]]'', written by a group of scientists led by [[Dennis Meadows|Dennis]] and [[Donella Meadows]] of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Describing the desirable "state of global equilibrium", the authors wrote: "We are searching for a model output that represents a world system that is sustainable without sudden and uncontrolled collapse and capable of satisfying the basic material requirements of all of its people."&lt;ref name=Finn-2009/&gt;

Following the Club of Rome report, an MIT research group prepared ten days of hearings on "[http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf Growth and Its Implication for the Future]" (Roundtable Press, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpainc.com/Archive/MIT/Growth%20and%20Its%20Implications.pdf|title=Growth and its implications for the future|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the US Congress, the first hearings ever held on sustainable development.

Since the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has developed beyond the initial intergenerational framework to focus more on the goal of "socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic growth".&lt;ref name=Sachs-2015/&gt;{{RP|5}} In 1992, the [[UN Conference on Environment and Development]] published the [[Earth Charter]], which outlines the building of a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society in the 21st century. The action plan [[Agenda 21]] for sustainable development identified information, integration, and participation as key building blocks to help countries achieve development that recognises these interdependent pillars. It emphasises that in sustainable development everyone is a user and provider of information. It stresses the need to change from old sector-centered ways of doing business to new approaches that involve cross-sectoral co-ordination and the integration of environmental and social concerns into all development processes. Furthermore, Agenda 21 emphasises that broad public participation in decision making is a fundamental prerequisite for achieving sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Will Allen. 2007.[http://learningforsustainability.net/susdev/ "Learning for Sustainability: Sustainable Development."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the principles of the [[United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration|Millennium Declaration]] identified principles and treaties on sustainable development, including [[economic development]], [[Social change|social development]] and [[environmental protection]]. Broadly defined, sustainable development is a systems approach to growth and development and to manage natural, produced, and [[social capital]] for the welfare of their own and future generations. The term sustainable development as used by the United Nations incorporates both issues associated with [[land development]] and broader issues of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] such as education, public health, and standard of living.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)==
In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly formally adopted the "universal, integrated and transformative" [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development], a set of 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs). The goals are to be implemented and achieved in every country from the year 2016 to 2030.

Sustainable development, or sustainability, has been described in terms of three spheres, dimensions, domains or pillars, i.e. the environment, the economy and society. The three-sphere framework was initially proposed by the economist René Passet in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4RFOAQAAIAAJ|title=L'Économique et le vivant|last=Passet|first=René|date=1979-01-01|publisher=Payot|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been worded as "economic, environmental and social" or "ecology, economy and equity".&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations|title=Prototype Global Sustainable Development Report|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Division for Sustainable Development|location=New York|date=2014|edition=Online unedited|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/globalsdreport/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been expanded by some authors to include a fourth pillar of culture, institutions or governance,&lt;ref name="Global Sustainability Report"/&gt; or alternatively reconfigured as four domains of the social - ecology, economics, politics and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus bringing economics back inside the social, and treating ecology as the intersection of the social and the natural.&lt;ref&gt;[http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process Circles of Sustainability Urban Profile Process] and {{Cite journal | year=2010 | first1= Andy |last1= Scerri | first2= Paul |  last2= James | authorlink2= Paul James (academic) | title= Accounting for sustainability: Combining qualitative and quantitative research in developing ‘indicators’ of sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230887/Accounting_for_Sustainability_Combining_Qualitative_and_Quantitative_Research_in_Developing_Indicators | journal= International Journal of Social Research Methodology | volume= 13 | issue= 1 | pages= 41–53 | doi=10.1080/13645570902864145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental sustainability concerns the [[natural environment]] and how it endures and remains diverse and productive. Since [[natural resources]] are derived from the environment, the state of air, water, and the climate are of particular concern. The [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] outlines current knowledge about scientific, technical and socio-economic information concerning [[climate change]], and lists options for [[Adaptation to global warming|adaptation]] and [[Climate change mitigation|mitigation]].&lt;ref name="Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental sustainability requires society to design activities to meet human needs while preserving the life support systems of the planet. This, for example, entails using water sustainably, utilizing renewable energy, and sustainable material supplies (e.g. harvesting wood from forests at a rate that maintains the biomass and biodiversity).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

An unsustainable situation occurs when [[natural capital]] (the sum total of nature's resources) is used up faster than it can be replenished. Sustainability requires that human activity only uses nature's resources at a rate at which they can be replenished naturally. Inherently the concept of sustainable development is intertwined with the concept of carrying capacity. Theoretically, the long-term result of [[environmental degradation]] is the inability to sustain human life.  Such degradation on a global scale should imply an increase in human death rate until population falls to what the degraded environment can support.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  If the degradation continues beyond a certain [[Planetary boundaries|tipping point]] or critical threshold it would lead to eventual [[extinction]] for humanity.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Integral elements for a sustainable development are research and innovation activities. A telling example is the [[European environmental research and innovation policy]], which aims at defining and implementing a transformative agenda to greening the economy and the society as a whole so to achieve a truly sustainable development. Research and innovation in Europe is financially supported by the programme [[Horizon 2020]], which is also open to participation worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;See Horizon 2020 – the EU's new research and innovation programme http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-13-1085_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A promising direction towards sustainable development is to design systems that are flexible and reversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09613218.2012.702565|date=2012 | doi=10.1080/09613218.2012.702565 | volume=40 |title=Flexible strategies for long-term sustainability under uncertainty |journal=Building Research |pages=545–557 | last1 = Fawcett | first1 = William | last2 = Hughes | first2 = Martin | last3 = Krieg | first3 = Hannes | last4 = Albrecht | first4 = Stefan | last5 = Vennström | first5 = Anders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vladan_Babovic/publication/269694158_HYDRO-D-09-00078/links/54925b6a0cf2484a3f3e0c41.pdf |last=Zhang|first=S.X.|author2=V.

Pollution of the public resources is really not a different action, it just is a reverse tragedy of the commons, in that instead of taking something out, something is put into the commons.  When the costs of polluting the commons are not calculated into the cost of the items consumed, then it becomes only natural to pollute, as the cost of pollution is external to the cost of the goods produced and the cost of cleaning the waste before it is discharged exceeds the cost of releasing the waste directly into the commons.  So, the only way to solve this problem is by protecting the ecology of the commons by making it, through taxes or fines, more costly to release the waste directly into the commons than would be the cost of cleaning the waste before discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Economics, Ecology, Ethics: Essays toward a Steady-State Economy|last=Daly|first=H. E.|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company|others=Hardin, G. "The tragedy of the commons"|year=|isbn=|location=New York and San Francisco|pages=100–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, one can try to appeal to the ethics of the situation by doing the right thing as an individual, but in the absence of any direct consequences, the individual will tend to do what is best for the person and not what is best for the common good of the public.  Once again, this issue needs to be addressed.  Because, left unaddressed, the development of the commonly owned property will become impossible to achieve in a sustainable way.  So, this topic is central to the understanding of creating a sustainable situation from the management of the public resources that are used for personal use.

====Agriculture====
{{See also|Sustainable agriculture}}
Sustainable agriculture consists of [[environment friendly]] methods of farming that allow the production of crops or livestock without damage to human or natural systems. It involves preventing adverse effects to soil, water, biodiversity, surrounding or downstream resources—as well as to those working or living on the farm or in neighboring areas. The concept of sustainable agriculture extends intergenerationally, passing on a conserved or improved natural resource, biotic, and economic base rather than one which has been depleted or polluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Networld-Project |url=http://www.green-networld.com/facts/glossary.htm |title=Environmental Glossary |publisher=Green-networld.com |date=1998-02-09 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elements of sustainable agriculture include [[permaculture]], [[agroforestry]], [[mixed farming]], [[multiple cropping]], and [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;Ben Falk, ''The resilient farm and homestead: An innovative permaculture and whole systems design approach''. Chelsea Green, 2013. pp. 61-78.&lt;/ref&gt; It involves agricultural methods that do not undermine the environment, smart farming technologies that enhance a quality environment for humans to thrive and reclaiming and transforming deserts into farmlands(Herman Daly, 2017). {{Citation needed|reason=reclaiming and transforming deserts is sustainable|date=December 2017}}

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and sustainable development guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber. (2008). How to be an ecological economist. ''Ecological Economics'' '''66'''(1):1-7. [https://ideas.repec.org/p/awi/wpaper/0454.html Preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as the 1970s, the concept of sustainability was used to describe an [[economy]] "in equilibrium with basic ecological support systems".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Stivers|Stivers, R.]] 1976. The Sustainable Society: Ethics and Economic Growth.

In 1987 the economist Edward Barbier published the study ''The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development'', where he recognised that goals of environmental conservation and economic development are not conflicting and can be reinforcing each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Barbier |first=E. |year=1987 |title=The Concept of Sustainable Economic Development |journal=Environmental Conservation |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1017/S0376892900011449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[World Bank]] study from 1999 concluded that based on the theory of genuine savings, policymakers have many possible interventions to increase sustainability, in [[macroeconomics]] or purely environmental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=K. |first2=M. |last2=Clemens |year=1999 |title=Genuine savings rates in developing countries |journal=World Bank Economy Review |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=333–356 |doi=10.1093/wber/13.2.333 | url=http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/13/2/333.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have noted that efficient policies for renewable energy and pollution are compatible with increasing human welfare, eventually reaching a golden-rule steady state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2001 |first=A.

The study, ''Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms'', found three pillars of sustainable development, interlinkage, [[intergenerational equity]], and [[dynamic efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stavins |first=R. |first2=A. |last2=Wagner |first3=G. |last3=Wagner |title=Interpreting Sustainability in Economic Terms: Dynamic Efficiency Plus Intergenerational Equity |journal=[[Economic Letters]] |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=339–343 |doi=10.1016/S0165-1765(03)00036-3 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But [[Gilbert Rist]] points out that the World Bank has twisted the notion of sustainable development to prove that economic development need not be deterred in the interest of preserving the ecosystem. He writes: "From this angle, 'sustainable development' looks like a cover-up operation. ... The thing that is meant to be sustained is really 'development', not the tolerance capacity of the ecosystem or of human societies."&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Development'', 3rd Ed. (New York: Zed, 2008) 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Bank, a leading producer of environmental knowledge, continues to advocate the win-win prospects for economic growth and ecological stability even as its economists express their doubts.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel P. Castillo, "Integral Ecology as a Liberationist Concept" in ''Theological Studies'', Vol 77, 2, June 2016, 374.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Daly]], an economist for the Bank from 1988 to 1994, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When authors of ''WDR'' '92 [the highly influential 1992 ''World Development Report'' that featured the environment] were drafting the report, they called me asking for examples of "win-win" strategies in my work. What could I say? None exists in that pure form; there are trade-offs, not "win-wins." But they want to see a world of "win-wins" based on articles of faith, not fact. I wanted to contribute because ''WDR''s are important in the Bank, [because] task managers read [them] to find philosophical justification for their latest round of projects. But they did not want to hear about how things really are, or what I find in my work..."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Goldman, ''Imperial Nature: the World Bank and the Struggle for Justice in the Age of Globalization.'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2005), 128, quoted in ''[[Theological Studies (journal)|Theological Studies]]'', supra.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Free-market environmentalism|free-market environmentalist]] [[John Baden]] "the improvement of environment quality depends on the [[market economy]] and the existence of legitimate and protected [[property]] rights". They enable the effective practice of personal responsibility and the development of mechanisms to protect the environment. The State can in this context "create conditions which encourage the people to save the environment".&lt;ref&gt;« [http://www.euro92.com/acrob/baden.pdf L'économie politique du développement durable]  {{Webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080910214053/http://www.euro92.com/acrob/baden.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }} », John Baden, document de l'ICREI&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Environmental economics ====
{{main|Environmental economics}}
The total environment includes not just the biosphere of earth, air, and water, but also human interactions with these things, with nature, and what humans have created as their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Economics, 3rd Edition. J.J. Seneca/M.K. Taussig. 1984. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

As countries around the world continue to advance economically, they put a strain on the ability of the natural environment to absorb the high level of pollutants that are created as a part of this economic growth. Therefore, solutions need to be found so that the economies of the world can continue to grow, but not at the expense of the public good.  In the world of economics the amount of environmental quality must be considered as limited in supply and therefore is treated as a scarce resource. This is a resource to be protected. One common way to analyze possible outcomes of policy decisions on the scarce resource is to do a cost-benefit analysis. This type of analysis contrasts different options of resource allocation and, based on an evaluation of the expected courses of action and the consequences of these actions, the optimal way to do so in the light of different policy goals can be elicited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbier|first1=E.B.|last2=Markandya|first2=A.|last3=Pearce|first3=D.W.|title=Environmental sustainability and cost-benefit analysis|journal=Environment and Planning A|date=1990|volume=22|doi=10.1068/a221259|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.1749&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=11 November 2016|pages=1259–1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefit-cost analysis basically can look at several ways of solving a problem and then assigning the best route for a solution, based on the set of consequences that would result from the further development of the individual courses of action, and then choosing the course of action that results in the least amount of damage to the expected outcome for the environmental quality that remains after that development or process takes place. Further complicating this analysis are the interrelationships of the various parts of the environment that might be impacted by the chosen course of action.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to predict the various outcomes of a course of action, due to the unexpected consequences and the amount of unknowns that are not accounted for in the benefit-cost analysis.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

====Energy====
{{Main|Smart grid|Sustainable energy}}
Sustainable energy is clean and can be used over a long period of time. Unlike fossil fuels and biofuels that provide the bulk of the worlds energy, [[renewable energy]] sources like hydroelectric, solar and wind energy produce far less pollution.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climate-biofuels-idUSBRE90601A20130107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fainstein, Susan S. 2000. "New Directions in Planning Theory," ''Urban Affairs Review'' 35:4 (March)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solar energy]] is commonly used on public parking meters, street lights and the roof of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bedsworf | first1 = Louise W. | last2 = Hanak | first2 = Ellen | year = 2010 | title = Adaptation to Climate Change | url = | journal = Journal of the American Planning Association | volume = 76 | issue = | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wind power]] has expanded quickly, its share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 3.1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf pg31&lt;/ref&gt; Most of California's fossil fuel infrastructures are sited in or near low-income communities, and have traditionally suffered the most from California's fossil fuel energy system.  These communities are historically left out during the decision-making process, and often end up with dirty power plants and other dirty energy projects that poison the air and harm the area. These toxicants are major contributors to health problems in the communities. As renewable energy becomes more common, fossil fuel infrastructures are replaced by renewables, providing better social equity to these communities.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Scott. 1996. "Green Cities, Growing Cities, Just Cities?: Urban planning and the Contradictions of Sustainable Development," Journal of the American Planning Association&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, and in the long run, sustainable development in the field of energy is also deemed to contribute to economic sustainability and national security of communities, thus being increasingly encouraged through investment policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farah|first1=Paolo Davide|title=Sustainable Energy Investments and National Security: Arbitration and Negotiation Issues|journal=JOURNAL OF WORLD ENERGY LAW AND BUSINESS|date=2015|volume=8|issue=6|ssrn=2695579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Technology====
{{See also|Appropriate technology|Environmental engineering|Environmental technology}}
One of the core concepts in sustainable development is that technology can be used to assist people meet their developmental needs. Technology to meet these sustainable development needs is often referred to as [[appropriate technology]], which is an ideological movement (and its manifestations) originally articulated as [[intermediate technology]] by the economist [[E. F. Schumacher]] in his influential work, ''[[Small is Beautiful]].'' and now covers a wide range of technologies.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Schumacher and many modern-day proponents of appropriate technology also emphasise the technology as people-centered.&lt;ref name=Akubue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Akubue|first=Anthony|title=Appropriate Technology for Socioeconomic Development in Third World Countries|journal=The Journal of Technology Studies|date=Winter–Spring 2000|volume=26|issue=1|pages=33–43.Retrieved March 2011|url=http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JOTS/Winter-Spring-2000/akabue.html|doi=10.21061/jots.v26i1.a.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today appropriate technology is often developed using [[Open-source model|open source]] principles, which have led to [[open-source appropriate technology]] (OSAT) and thus many of the plans of the technology can be freely found on the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pearce | first1 = Joshua M. | year = 2012 | title = The Case for Open Source Appropriate Technology | url =https://www.academia.edu/1517361/The_Case_for_Open_Source_Appropriate_Technology | journal = Environment, Development and Sustainability | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 425–431 | doi = 10.1007/s10668-012-9337-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling [[innovation]] for sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce J., Albritton S., Grant G., Steed G., &amp; Zelenika I. 2012.

====Transport====
{{See also|Sustainable transport}}
Transportation is a large contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that one-third of all gasses produced are due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sustainable Transport in Freiburg: Lessons from Germany's Environmental Capital|last = Buehler|first = Ralph|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Sustainable Transportation&lt;!-- 23:04:16--&gt;|doi = 10.1080/15568311003650531|pmid = |last2 = Pucher|first2 = John|volume=5|pages=43–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorized transport also releases exhaust fumes that contain particulate matter which is hazardous to human health and a contributor to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-breathe-clean/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Breathe clean|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainable transport has many social and economic benefits that can accelerate local sustainable development. According to a series of reports by the [[Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership (LEDS GP)]], sustainable transport can help create jobs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-create-jobs/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Create jobs|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; improve commuter safety through investment in bicycle lanes and pedestrian pathways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-make-roads-safe/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Make roads safe|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; make access to employment and social opportunities more affordable and efficient. It also offers a practical opportunity to save people's time and household income as well as government budgets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ledsgp.org/resource/leds-practice-save-time-money/?loclang=en_gb|title=LEDS in Practice: Save money and time|work=The Low Emission Development Strategies Global Partnership}}&lt;/ref&gt; making investment in sustainable transport a 'win-win' opportunity.

Some Western countries are making transportation more sustainable in both long-term and short-term implementations.&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Elissa and Elizabeth A. Deakin. 2012. "Smart Growth Planning for Climate Protection"&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the modification in available transportation in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg, Germany]]. The city has implemented extensive methods of public transportation, cycling, and walking, along with large areas where cars are not allowed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since many Western countries are highly automobile-oriented, the main transit that people use is personal vehicles. About 80% of their travel involves cars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Therefore, California, is one of the highest [[greenhouse gases]] emitters in the United States. The federal government has to come up with some plans to reduce the total number of vehicle trips in order to lower greenhouse gases emission. Such as:

* Improve public transit through the provision of larger coverage area in order to provide more mobility and accessibility, new technology to provide a more reliable and responsive public transportation network.&lt;ref&gt;Murthy, A.S. Narasimha Mohle, Henry. [http://site.ebrary.com/lib/alltitles/docDetail.action?docID=10447877&amp;p00=transportation%20improvement Transportation Engineering Basics (2nd Edition)]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. (American Society of Civil Engineers 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Encourage walking and biking through the provision of wider pedestrian pathway, bike share stations in downtowns, locate parking lots far from the shopping center, limit on street parking, slower traffic lane in downtown area.
* Increase the cost of car ownership and gas taxes through increased parking fees and tolls, encouraging people to drive more fuel efficient vehicles. This can produce a social equity problem, since lower income people usually drive older vehicles with lower fuel efficiency. Government can use the extra revenue collected from taxes and tolls to improve public transportation and benefit poor communities.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Jonathan. 2013. "Urban Transportation and Social Equity: Transportation Planning Paradigms that Impede Policy Reform," in Naomi Carmon and Susan S. Fainstein, eds. Policy, Planning and people: promoting Justice in Urban Development (Penn)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other states and nations have built efforts to [[knowledge translation|translate knowledge]] in [[behavioral economics]] into [[evidence-based]] [[sustainable transportation]] policies.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

====Business====

{{See also|Corporate sustainability}}
The most broadly accepted criterion for corporate sustainability constitutes a firm's efficient use of natural capital.  This [[eco-efficiency]] is usually calculated as the economic value added by a firm in relation to its aggregated ecological impact.&lt;ref&gt;Schaltegger, S. &amp; Sturm, A. 1998. Eco-Efficiency by Eco-Controlling. Zürich: vdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea has been popularised by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development ([[WBCSD]]) under the following definition: "Eco-efficiency is achieved by the delivery of competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life, while progressively reducing ecological impacts and [[resource intensity]] throughout the life-cycle to a level at least in line with the earth's carrying capacity" (DeSimone and Popoff, 1997: 47).&lt;ref&gt;DeSimone, L. &amp; Popoff, F. 1997. Eco-efficiency: The business link to sustainable development. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the eco-efficiency concept but so far less explored is the second criterion for corporate sustainability. Socio-efficiency&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyllick | first1 = T. | last2 = Hockerts | first2 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Beyond the business case for corporate sustainability | url = | journal = Business Strategy and the Environment | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 130–141 | doi=10.1002/bse.323}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the relation between a firm's value added and its social impact. Whereas, it can be assumed that most corporate impacts on the environment are negative (apart from rare exceptions such as the planting of trees) this is not true for social impacts. These can be either positive (e.g. corporate giving, creation of employment) or negative (e.g. work accidents, mobbing of employees, human rights abuses). Depending on the type of impact socio-efficiency thus either tries to minimise negative social impacts (i.e. accidents per value added) or maximise positive social impacts (i.e. donations per value added) in relation to the value added.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Both eco-efficiency and socio-efficiency are concerned primarily with increasing economic sustainability. In this process they instrumentalise both natural and social capital aiming to benefit from win-win situations. However, as Dyllick and Hockerts&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; point out the business case alone will not be sufficient to realise sustainable development. They point towards eco-effectiveness, socio-effectiveness, sufficiency, and eco-equity as four criteria that need to be met if sustainable development is to be reached.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

CASI Global, New York "CSR &amp; Sustainability together lead to sustainable development. CSR as in corporate social responsibility is not what you do with your profits, but is the way you make profits. This means CSR is a part of every department of the company value chain and not a part of HR / independent department. Sustainability as in effects towards Human resources, Environment and Ecology has to be measured within each department of the company." http://casiglobal.us/

====Income====

At the present time, sustainable development can reduce [[poverty]]. Sustainable development reduces [[poverty]] through financial (among other things, a balanced budget), environmental (living conditions), and social (including equality of income) means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wydawnictwoumk.pl/czasopisma/index.php/CJFA/article/view/CJFA.2014.001/3213 S. Adamiak, D. Walczak, Sustainable development and social solidarism in the context of social security, Copernican Journal of Finance &amp; Accounting, Vol 3, No 1, p. 12,17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Architecture====

{{See also|Sustainable architecture}}
In sustainable architecture the recent movements of [[New Urbanism]] and [[New Classical architecture]] promote a sustainable approach towards construction, that appreciates and develops [[smart growth]], [[Vernacular architecture|architectural tradition]] and [[Classical architecture|classical design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/charter Charter of the New Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty, Humanism, Continuity between Past and Future|url=http://www.traditionalarchitecture.co.uk/aims.html|publisher=Traditional Architecture Group|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This in contrast to [[Modern architecture|modernist]] and [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] architecture, as well as opposing to solitary [[housing estate]]s and [[Urban sprawl|suburban sprawl]], with long commuting distances and large ecological footprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia.org/SiteObjects/files/smartgrowth05.pdf Issue Brief: Smart-Growth: Building Livable Communities]. American Institute of Architects. Retrieved on 2014-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Both trends started in the 1980s. (It should be noted that sustainable architecture is predominantly relevant to the economics domain while architectural landscaping pertains more to the ecological domain.){{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Politics===
{{See also|Environmental politics|Environmental governance|Sustainability metrics and indices}}
A study concluded that social indicators and, therefore, sustainable development indicators, are scientific constructs whose principal objective is to inform public policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul-Marie Boulanger |url=http://sapiens.revues.org/index166.html |title=Sustainable development indicators: a scientific challenge, a democratic issue. '&amp;#39;S.A.P.I.EN.S.'&amp;#39; '&amp;#39;'1'&amp;#39;' (1) |publisher=Sapiens.revues.org |year=2008 |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] has similarly developed a political policy framework, linked to a sustainability index for establishing measurable entities and metrics. The framework consists of six core areas, international trade and investment, economic policy, climate change and energy, measurement and assessment, natural resource management, and the role of communication technologies in sustainable development.

The [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme has defined sustainable political development in a way that broadens the usual definition beyond states and governance. The political is defined as the domain of practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power as they pertain to the organisation, authorisation, legitimation and regulation of a social life held in common. This definition is in accord with the view that political change is important for responding to economic, ecological and cultural challenges. It also means that the politics of economic change can be addressed. They have listed seven subdomains of the domain of politics:&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"/&gt;

#Organization and governance
#Law and justice
#Communication and critique
#Representation and negotiation
#Security and accord
#Dialogue and reconciliation
#Ethics and accountability

This accords with the Brundtland Commission emphasis on development that is guided by human rights principles (see above).

===Culture===

[[File:Circles of Sustainability image (assessment - Melbourne 2011).jpg|250px|thumb|Framing of sustainable development progress according to the [[Circles of Sustainability]], used by the [[United Nations Global Compact|United Nations]].]]
Working with a different emphasis, some researchers and institutions have pointed out that a fourth dimension should be added to the dimensions of sustainable development, since the triple-bottom-line dimensions of economic, environmental and social do not seem to be enough to reflect the complexity of contemporary society. In this context, the [[Agenda 21 for culture]] and the [[United Cities and Local Governments]] (UCLG)  Executive Bureau lead the preparation of the policy statement "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development", passed on 17 November 2010, in the framework of the World Summit of Local and Regional Leaders&amp;nbsp;– 3rd World Congress of UCLG, held in Mexico City. This document inaugurates a new perspective and points to the relation between culture and sustainable development through a dual approach: developing a solid [[cultural policy]] and advocating a cultural dimension in all public policies. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach distinguishes the four domains of economic, ecological, political and cultural sustainability.&lt;ref name="agenda21culture.net"&gt;United Cities and Local Governments, [http://agenda21culture.net/index.php/16-official-documentation-all/agenda-21-culture-all/437-cultural-policies-and-sustainable-development "Culture: Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uclg.org/en/node/21824&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/15885475/Assessing_Cultural_Sustainability_Agenda_21_for_Culture&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations have also supported the idea of a fourth domain of sustainable development. The Network of Excellence "Sustainable Development in a Diverse World",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.susdiv.org/ |title=Sus.Div |publisher=Sus.Div |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; sponsored by the [[European Union]], integrates multidisciplinary capacities and interprets [[cultural diversity]] as a key element of a new strategy for sustainable development. The Fourth Pillar of Sustainable Development Theory has been referenced by executive director of IMI Institute at [[UNESCO]] Vito Di Bari&lt;ref&gt;"Agreement between UNESCO and the City of Milan concerning the International Multimedia Institute (IMI) - Appointment of Executive Director&amp;nbsp;— UNESCO Archives ICA AtoM catalogue". Atom.archives.unesco.org. 1999-10-08. Retrieved 2014-01-17.&lt;/ref&gt; in his manifesto of art and architectural movement [[Neo-Futurism]], whose name was inspired by the 1987 [[United Nations]]’ report [[Our Common Future]]. The [[Circles of Sustainability]] approach used by Metropolis defines the (fourth) cultural domain as practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.&lt;ref name="citiesprogramme.com"&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process {{Cite journal

===Progress===
{{See also|Sustainable development goals}}
The [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD; also known as Rio 2012) was the third international conference on sustainable development,  which aimed at reconciling the economic and environmental goals of the global community. An outcome of this conference was the development of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] that aim to promote sustainable progress and eliminate inequalities around the world. However, few nations met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of sustainable development criteria established in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], [[Zoological Society of London]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}; [http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm World failing on sustainable development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209164418/http://www.science.org.au/nova/newscientist/107ns_004.htm |date=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some nations are more developed than others, all nations are constantly developing because each nation struggles with perpetuating disparities, inequalities and unequal access to fundamental rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creating Capabilities: The Human Development Approach|last = Nussbaum|first = Martha|publisher = The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-674-05054-9|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts and London, England|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 a report for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated: "While much discussion and effort has gone into sustainability indicators, none of the resulting systems clearly tells us whether our society is sustainable. At best, they can tell us that we are heading in the wrong direction, or that our current activities are not sustainable. More often, they simply draw our attention to the existence of problems, doing little to tell us the origin of those problems and nothing to tell us how to solve them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/1841126/Environmental-Protection-Agency-hechtepaordpaper |title=Joy E.

Those indicators are expected to be identified and adjusted through empirical observations (trial and error).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2006 | title = An adaptive learning process for developing and applying sustainability indicators with local communities | url = http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Ecological economics | volume = 59 | issue =  | pages = 406–418 | doi = 10.1016/j.ecolecon.2005.11.008 | last1 = Reed | first1 = Mark S. | access-date = 18 February 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110726045818/http://km.fao.org/uploads/media/An%20adaptative%20learning%20process%20for%20developing%20and%20applying%20sustainability%20indicators%20with%20local%20communities.pdf | archive-date = 26 July 2011 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common critiques are related to issues like data quality, comparability, objective function and the necessary resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |title=Annette Lang, Ist Nachhaltigkeit messbar?, Uni Hannover, 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110802135133/http://www.nse-netz.de/downloads/nachh.pdf |archive-date=2 August 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However a more general criticism is coming from the project management community: How can a sustainable development be achieved at global level if we cannot monitor it in any single project?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://youth-partnership-eu.coe.int/youth-partnership/documents/Publications/T_kits/3/tkit3.pdf |title=Project Management T-kit, Council of Europe and European Commission, Strasbourg, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |title=Do global targets matter?, The Environment Times, Poverty Times #4, UNEP/GRID-Arendal, 2010 |publisher=Grida.no |accessdate=2011-09-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629043039/http://www.grida.no/publications/et/ep4/page/2653.aspx |archive-date=29 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cuban-born researcher and entrepreneur Sonia Bueno suggests an alternative approach that is based upon the integral, long-term cost-benefit relationship as a measure and monitoring tool for the sustainability of every project, activity or enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.empai-matanzas.co.cu/revista/REVISTA_archivos/Page969.htm |title=Sostenibilidad en la construcción.

Reasonable qualifications of sustainability are seen U.S. Green Building Council's (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). This design incorporates some ecological, economic, and social elements. The goals presented by LEED design goals are sustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmospheric emission reduction, material and resources efficiency, and indoor environmental quality. Although amount of structures for sustainability development is many, these qualification has become a standard for sustainable building.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Recent research efforts created also the [[SDEWES Centre#SDEWES Index|SDEWES Index]] to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. The [[SDEWES Centre|SDEWES]] Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SDEWES Centre - SDEWES Index|url = http://www.sdewes.org/sdewes_index.php|website = www.sdewes.org|accessdate = 2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural capital===
[[File:Hillside deforestation in Rio de Janeiro.jpg|300px|thumb|alt=Deforastation of native rain forest in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of clay for civil construction|[[Deforestation]] of native [[rain forest]] in Rio de Janeiro City for extraction of [[clay]] for [[civil engineering]] (2009 picture).]]
The sustainable development debate is based on the assumption that societies need to manage three types of capital (economic, social, and natural), which may be non-substitutable and whose consumption might be irreversible.&lt;ref name="Dyllick, T. 2002"/&gt; Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]],&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt; for example, points to the fact that [[natural capital]] can not necessarily be substituted by economic capital. While it is possible that we can find ways to replace some natural resources, it is much more unlikely that they will ever be able to replace eco-system services, such as the protection provided by the ozone layer, or the climate stabilizing function of the Amazonian forest. In fact natural capital, social capital and economic capital are often complementarities. A further obstacle to substitutability lies also in the multi-functionality of many natural resources. Forests, for example, not only provide the raw material for paper (which can be substituted quite easily), but they also maintain biodiversity, regulate water flow, and absorb CO2.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Another problem of natural and social capital deterioration lies in their partial irreversibility. The [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], for example, is often definitive. The same can be true for cultural diversity. For example, with globalisation advancing quickly the number of indigenous languages is dropping at alarming rates.  Moreover, the depletion of natural and social capital may have non-linear consequences. Consumption of natural and social capital may have no observable impact until a certain threshold is reached. A lake can, for example, absorb nutrients for a long time while actually increasing its productivity. However, once a certain level of algae is reached lack of oxygen causes the lake's ecosystem to break down suddenly.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Business-as-usual===
[[File:Air pollution by industrial chimneys.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Before [[flue-gas desulfurization]] was installed, the [[air pollution|air-polluting]] emissions from this power plant in [[New Mexico]] contained excessive amounts of [[sulfur dioxide]].]]
If the degradation of natural and social capital has such important consequence the question arises why action is not taken more systematically to alleviate it. Cohen and Winn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = B. | last2 = Winn | first2 = M. I. | year = 2007 | title = Market imperfections, opportunity and sustainable entrepreneurship | url = | journal = Journal of Business Venturing | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1016/j.jbusvent.2004.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; point to four types of market failure as possible explanations: First, while the benefits of natural or social capital depletion can usually be privatised, the costs are often externalised (i.e. they are borne not by the party responsible but by society in general). Second, natural capital is often undervalued by society since we are not fully aware of the real cost of the depletion of natural capital. Information asymmetry is a third reason—often the link between cause and effect is obscured, making it difficult for actors to make informed choices. Cohen and Winn close with the realization that contrary to economic theory many firms are not perfect optimisers. They postulate that firms often do not optimise resource allocation because they are caught in a "business as usual" mentality.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Education===
''Main page: [[Education for sustainable development]]''

Education must be revisited in light of a renewed vision of sustainable human and social development that is both equitable and viable. This vision of sustainability must take into consideration the social, environmental and economic dimensions of human development and the various ways in which these relate to education: ‘An empowering education is one that builds the human resources we need to be productive, to continue to learn, to solve problems, to be creative, and to live together and with nature in peace and harmony. When nations ensure that such an education is accessible to all throughout their lives, a quiet revolution is set in motion: education becomes the engine of sustainable development and the key to a better world.’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Education: Education for All, Development, Globalisation and UNESCO|last=Power|first=C|publisher=London, Springer|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Higher education in sustainability across education streams including engineering, finance, supply chain and operations is gaining weight-age. Multiple institutes including Wharton, Columbia, CASI Global New York offer certifications in Sustainability.
Corporate's prefer employees certified in sustainability.

== Insubstantial stretching of the term ==
It has been argued that since the 1960s, the concept of sustainable development has changed from "conservation management" to "economic development", whereby the original meaning of the concept has been stretched somewhat.&lt;ref name=to01&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Riordan |first=Timothy |date=1993 |chapter=The Politics of Sustainability |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Economics and Management: Principles and Practice. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48–54}}

In the 1960s, the international community realised that many African countries needed national plans to safeguard wildlife habitats, and that rural areas had to confront the limits imposed by soil, climate and water availability. This was a strategy of conservation management. In the 1970s, however, the focus shifted to the broader issues of the provisioning of basic human needs, community participation as well as appropriate technology use throughout the developing countries (and not just in Africa). This was a strategy of economic development, and the strategy was carried even further by the [[Brundtland Commission]]'s report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' when the issues went from regional to international in scope and application.&lt;ref name=to01/&gt;{{rp|48–54}} In effect, the conservationists were crowded out and superseded by the developers.

But shifting the focus of sustainable development from conservation to development has had the imperceptible effect of stretching the original forest management term of [[sustainable yield]] from the use of renewable resources only (like forestry), to now also accounting for the use of non-renewable resources (like [[Natural resource#Classification|minerals]]).&lt;ref name=kt01&gt;{{cite book |last=Turner |first=R. Kerry |date=1988 |chapter=Sustainability, Resource Conservation and Pollution Control: An Overview |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=R. Kerry |title=Sustainable Environmental Management. |location=London |publisher=Belhaven Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} This stretching of the term has been questioned. Thus, environmental economist Kerry Turner has argued that literally, there can be no such thing as overall "sustainable development" in an industrialised [[world economy]] that remains heavily dependent on the extraction of earth's finite stock of exhaustible mineral resources: "It makes no sense to talk about the sustainable use of a non-renewable resource (even with substantial [[recycling]] effort and use rates). Any positive rate of exploitation will eventually lead to exhaustion of the finite stock."&lt;ref name=kt01/&gt;{{rp|13}}

In effect, it has been argued that the industrial revolution as a whole is unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |authorlink=Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20f}}&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|22f}}&lt;ref name=jr01&gt;{{cite book |last=Rifkin |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Rifkin |date=1980 |title=Entropy: A New World View. |url=http://www.foet.org/FOET-data/uploads/2017/03/Jeremy-Rifkin-Entropy-table-of-contents.pdf |format=PDF contains only the title and contents pages of the book |location=New York |publisher=The Viking Press |isbn=0670297178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61–67}}&lt;ref name="Monbiot-20171124"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Everything Must Go|url=http://www.monbiot.com/2017/11/24/everything-must-go/|website=George Monbiot|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critic has argued that the [[Brundtland Commission]] promoted nothing but a business as usual strategy for world development, with the ambiguous and insubstantial concept of "sustainable development" attached as a public relations slogan:&lt;ref name=ap01&gt;{{cite book |last=Perez-Carmona |first=Alexander |date=2013 |chapter=Growth: A Discussion of the Margins of Economic and Ecological Thought |chapter-url=http://www.slideshare.net/lucieevers1/growth-in-margin-of-ecological-thought-by-perez |editor-last=Meuleman |editor-first=Louis |title=Transgovernance. Advancing Sustainability Governance. |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-28009-2_3 |chapter-format=Article accessible at SlideShare |location=Heidelberg |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783642280085 |pages=83–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94–99}} The report on ''[[Our Common Future]]'' was largely the result of a political bargaining process involving many special interest groups, all put together to create a common appeal of political acceptability across borders. After World War II, the notion of "development" had been established in the West to imply the projection of the American model of society onto the rest of the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, this notion was broadened somewhat to also imply human rights, basic human needs and finally, ecological issues. The emphasis of the report was on helping poor nations out of poverty and meeting the basic needs of their growing populations—as usual. This issue demanded more economic growth, also in the rich countries, who would then import more goods from the poor countries to help them out—as usual. When the discussion switched to [[Steady-state economy#Present background: Exceeding global limits to growth|global ecological limits to growth]], the obvious dilemma was left aside by calling for economic growth with improved resource efficiency, or what was termed "a change in the ''quality'' of growth". However, most countries in the West had experienced such improved resource efficiency since the early-20th century already and as usual; only, this improvement had been more than offset by continuing industrial expansion, to the effect that world resource consumption was now higher than ever before—and these two historical trends were completely ignored in the report. Taken together, the policy of perpetual economic growth for the entire planet remained virtually intact. Since the publication of the report, the ambiguous and insubstantial slogan of "sustainable development" has marched on worldwide.&lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|94–99}}

'''Sust 'n' Able''' is the [[Woodcraft Folk]]'s programme of education for [[sustainable development]].
[[Image:sustnable.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Sust'N'Able Logo]]

The project was the theme of the Woodcraft Folk's 2001 international camp in [[Nottinghamshire]] where 4,000 young people attended. The camp focused on sustainable development education and ran activates for children from five to twenty five around the themes.

At the camp a simulation game took place called '''World on a Tight Rope'', it ran the length of the camp and involved people working for credits to create a more sustainable world. The simulation included two 'Earth Summits' held at the camp to come up with a declaration to the world's leaders at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD). The Earth Summit had "action stations" where people debated the issues to be included in the declaration.

==The declaration and delegation==
The Declaration created as part of the simulation game was presented by a delegation of 11 young people. The delegation attended the [[United Nations]]' [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] including both the civil society and the official political areas of the summit. The group worked with the [[International Falcon Movement - Socialist Education International]] delegation attending the summit.

Delegations from Woodcraft Folk attend all the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] meetings in [[New York City]] which are follow-up meetings to the annual WSSD, with thematic cycles changing every two years.

'''Talairach coordinates''', also known as '''Talairach space''', is a 3-dimensional [[coordinate system]] (known as an 'atlas') of the human brain, which is used to [[brain mapping|map]] the location of brain structures independent from individual differences in the size and overall shape of the brain. It is still common to use Talairach coordinates in [[Functional imaging|functional brain imaging]] studies and to target transcranial stimulation of brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Medical Imaging: Processing and Analysis Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHkkPBnhT-MC&amp;pg=PA565|date=9 October 2000|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-053310-0|pages=565}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, alternative methods such as the [[MNI Coordinate System]] originated at the [[Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital]] have largely replaced Talairach for [[Stereotactic surgery|stereotaxy]] and other procedures.&lt;ref name="PoldrackMumford2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Russell A. Poldrack|author2=Jeanette A. Mumford|author3=Thomas E. Nichols|title=Handbook of Functional MRI Data Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VjwBnVRwuD8C&amp;pg=PA17|date=22 August 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49836-4|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The coordinate system was first created by [[neurosurgeon]]s [[Jean Talairach]] and Gabor Szikla in their work on the ''Talairach Atlas'' in 1967, creating a standardized grid for neurosurgery.&lt;ref name="TS1967"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Talairach |first=Jean |last2=Szikla |first2=G. |date=1967 |title=Atlas of stereotactic concepts to the surgery of epilepsy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grid was based on the idea that distances to lesions in the brain are proportional to overall brain size (i.e., the distance between two structures is larger in a larger brain). In 1988 a second edition of the ''Talairach Atlas'' came out that was coauthored by Tournoux, and it is sometimes known as the Talairach–Tournoux system. This atlas was based on single post-mortem dissection of a human brain.&lt;ref name="Lazar2008"&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicole|last=Lazar|authorlink= Nicole Lazar |title=The Statistical Analysis of Functional MRI Data|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VcX8g9k_SnEC&amp;pg=PA88|date=10 June 2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-78191-4|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Talairach Atlas'' uses [[Brodmann area]]s as the labels for brain regions.&lt;ref name="Vogt2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brent Vogt|title=Cingulate Neurobiology and Disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwZ4KpPBxe4C&amp;pg=PA4|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-856696-0|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Talairach coordinate system is defined by making two anchors, the [[anterior commissure]] and [[posterior commissure]], lie on a straight horizontal line.&lt;ref name="YangJiang2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Guang-Zhong Yang|author2=Tianzi Jiang|title=Medical Imaging and Augmented Reality: Second International Workshop, MIAR 2004, Beijing, China, August 19-20, 2004, Proceedings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bbVq3-OR44C&amp;pg=PA179|date=11 August 2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-22877-6|pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these two points lie on the midsagittal plane, the coordinate system is completely defined by requiring this plane to be vertical. Distances in Talairach coordinates are measured from the anterior commissure as the origin (as defined in the 1998 edition). The y-axis points posterior and anterior to the commissures, the left and right is the x-axis, and the z-axis is in the ventral-dorsal (down and up) directions.&lt;ref name="Toennies2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus D. Toennies|title=Guide to Medical Image Analysis: Methods and Algorithms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtij1fQesqcC&amp;pg=PA326|date=4 February 2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4471-2751-2|pages=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the brain is reoriented to these axes, the researchers must also outline the six cortical outlines of the brain: anterior, posterior, left, right, inferior, and superior.&lt;ref name="MillerCummings2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Bruce L. Miller|author2=Jeffrey L. Cummings|title=The Human Frontal Lobes: Functions and Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBcPYvqE19QC&amp;pg=PA173|year=2007|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=978-1-59385-329-7|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1967 atlas the left is with positive coordinates while in the 1988 atlas the left has negative coordinates.

By defining standard anatomical landmarks that could be identified on different subjects (the anterior and posterior commissures), it became easier to spatially warp an individual brain image obtained through [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) and other imaging methods to this standard Talairach space. One can then make inferences about tissue identity at a specific location by referring to the atlas.

==Conversion to other coordinate systems==
Another common atlas for the human brain is the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (MNI) coordinate system, which is the template used for [[Statistical parametric mapping|SPM]] and the International Consortium for Brain Mapping. Most [[List of neuroimaging software|neuroimaging software packages]] are able to convert from Talairach to MNI coordinates.

A '''task force''' ('''TF''') is a [[Military organization|unit or formation]] established to work on a single defined task or activity. Originally introduced by the [[United States Navy]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} the term has now caught on for general usage and is a standard part of [[NATO]] terminology.  Many non-military organizations now create "task forces" or task groups for temporary activities that might have once been performed by ''[[ad hoc|ad hoc (designated purpose)]]'' [[committee]]s.
{{army units}}

==Naval==
{{Naval units}}
The concept of a naval task force is as old as navies, and prior to that time the assembly of ships for naval operations was referred to as [[naval fleet|fleets]], [[Division (naval)|division]]s, or on the smaller scale, [[squadron (naval)|squadron]]s, and [[flotilla]]s.

Before [[World War II]] ships were collected into [[Division (naval)|divisions]] derived from the [[Royal Navy]]'s "division" of the [[line of battle]] in which one squadron usually remained under the direct command of the [[Admiral of the Fleet]], one squadron was commanded by a [[Vice Admiral]], and one by a [[Rear Admiral]], each of the three squadrons flying different coloured flags, hence the terms [[flagship]] and [[flag officer]]. The flag of the Fleet Admiral's squadron was red, the Vice Admiral's was white and the Rear Admiral's blue. (The names "Vice" (possibly from advanced) and "Rear" might have derived from sailing positions within the line at the moment of [[Engagement (military)|engagement]].) In the late 19th century ships were collected in numbered [[squadron (naval)|squadrons]], which were assigned to named (such as the [[Asiatic Fleet]]) and later numbered [[naval fleet|fleet]]s.

A task force can be assembled using ships from different divisions and squadrons, without requiring a formal and permanent fleet reorganization, and can be easily dissolved following completion of the operational task. The task force concept worked very well, and by the end of World War II about 100 task forces had been created in the U.S. Navy alone {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

===United States Navy===
In the [[United States Navy]], task forces are generally temporary organizations composed of particular ships, aircraft, submarines, military land forces, or shore service units, assigned to fulfill certain missions. The emphasis is placed on the individual commander of the unit, and references to "Commander, Task Force" ("CTF") are common.

==== History ====
In the U.S. Navy, task forces as part of numbered fleets have been assigned a two-digit number since March 1943, when Commander-in-Chief, [[United States Fleet]], Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] instituted the system of numbering all fleets, assigning the even numbers to the Atlantic and the odd to the Pacific.

Naval Forces, Europe, became the Twelfth Fleet, South Atlantic Force the Fourth Fleet, and Naval Forces, Northwest African Waters, the Eighth Fleet. The Atlantic Fleet, itself, was designated the Second Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;''HyperWar'', [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/USN-Admin/USN-Admin-4.html Chapter 4: Fleet Administration], accessed August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United States Navy has used numbered task forces in the same way since 1945. The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] often forms a [[Joint Task Force]] if the force includes units from other services. Joint Task Force 1 was the atomic bomb test force during the post-World War II [[Operation Crossroads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Road to Trinity |last=Nichols |first=K.D. |year=1987 |publisher=Morrow |location=New York |isbn=068806910X |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In naval terms, the multinational ([[Australia]], [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and [[New Zealand]]) [[Combined Communications Electronics Board]] mandates through Allied Communications Publication 113 (ACP 113) the present system, which allocated numbers from 1 to 834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcs.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ACP113AFMC5.pdf |title=Annex A: Task Force Allocations |author=Combined Communication Electronics Board |date=September 2004 |work=ACP 113(AF) Call Sign Book for Ships |publisher=[[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] |pages=A-1–A-2 (197–198) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228002817/http://www.jcs.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ACP113AFMC5.pdf |archivedate=February 28, 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2010 |authorlink=Combined Communications Electronics Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Royal Navy's ''[[HMS Illustrious (R06)|Illustrious]]'' [[Carrier battle group|battle group]] in 2000 for Exercise Linked Seas, subsequently deployed to [[Operation Palliser]], was Task Group 342.1.&lt;ref&gt;Operations in Sierra Leone, August 9, 2000, ''[[Jane's Defence Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Navy]] is allocated the series TF 470–474, and [[Task Force 473]] has been used recently for an [[Enduring Freedom]] task force deployment built around the [[French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle (R91)|French aircraft carrier ''Charles de Gaulle'' (R91)]]. Task Force 142 is the U.S. Navy's [[Operational Test and Evaluation Force]].

==== Designation ====
The first digit of a task force designation is that of its parent fleet while the second is sequential. Task groups within a force are numbered by an additional digit separated from the TF number by a decimal point. Task units within a group are indicated by an additional decimal. For example, "the third task unit of the fifth task group of the second task force of the Sixth Fleet would be numbered 62.5.3." This system extends further to task elements, individual ships in a task group. This arrangement was typically abbreviated, so references like [[TF 11]] are commonly seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/group.htm Group]. GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved 2009-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no requirement for uniqueness over time (e.g., the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] used TF 76 in World War II, and off Vietnam, and continued to use TF 70–79 numberings throughout the rest of the twentieth century, and up to 2012).

{{main article|List of task forces of the Royal Navy}}

Earlier in the [[World War II|Second World War]], the British [[Royal Navy]] had already devised its own system of ''Forces,'' they mainly assigned a letter occasionally a number some of the task forces are listed below .

'''''Lettered Task Forces'''''

*[[Force A]] 
Originally stationed at [[Malta]] took part in the [[Battle of Calabria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rohwer|first1=[by] J.|last2=Masters|first2=G. Hümmelchen.

''Post second world war''

During the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 Royal Navy assembled as Task Force 317 to achieve sea and [[air supremacy]] in the [[Total Exclusion Zone]], before the [[amphibious warfare|amphibious forces]] arrived.

===Other===
In Argentina [[Argentine Navy|Navy]] task force (Grupo de Tareas, Task Force) [[:es:Grupo de tareas 3.3.2|G.T.3.3.2 (Spanish link)]] ran task units that were responsible for thousands of instances of forced disappearance, torture and illegal execution of Argentine civilians, many of whom were incarcerated in the [[Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy]] detention center during the 1976–1983 military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/arg/doc/perren1.html |title=Declaración de Jorge Enrique Perren ante el juez Bonadio |trans-title=Testimony of Jorge Enrique Perren before judge Bonadio |newspaper=Derechos.org |date=30 August 2001 |author= |accessdate=20 January 2016 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 the [[Argentine Navy]] formed three smaller Task Groups called (''Grupo de Tareas'') for pincer movements against the [[Royal Navy]].

==Army==
In the [[U.S. Army]], a task force is a [[battalion]]-sized (usually, although there are variations in size) ''ad hoc'' unit formed by attaching smaller elements of other units.  A [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized unit with an [[armored warfare|armored]] or [[mechanized infantry]] unit attached is called a ''company team''. A similar unit at the [[brigade]] level is called a ''[[brigade combat team]]'' (BCT), and there is also a similar ''[[Regimental combat team]]'' (RCT).

In the [[British Army]] and the armies of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]], such units are traditionally known as [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]]s.

The [[1st Australian Task Force]] (1 ATF) was a [[brigade]]-sized formation which commanded [[Australian Army|Australian]] and [[New Zealand Army]] units deployed to [[South Vietnam]] between 1966 and 1972.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=177}} More recently, Australian task forces have been designated to cover temporary support elements such the battalion-sized force which operated in [[Urozgan Province]], Afghanistan from 2006 to 2013,&lt;ref name="APH Afghanistan chronology as of 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brangwin|first1=Nicole|last2=Rann|first2=Anne|title=Australia’s military involvement in Afghanistan since 2001: a chronology|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/MilitaryInvolvementAfghanistan|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=31 December 2016|date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response|Northern Territory Emergency Response Task Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation OUTREACH|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/opEx/global/opoutreach/index.htm|work=Global Operations|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=18 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824180209/http://www.defence.gov.au/opEx/global/opoutreach/index.htm|archivedate=24 August 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

In government or business a task force is a temporary organization created to solve a particular problem. It is considered to be a more formal ''ad hoc'' [[committee]].

A '''taskforce''', or more-commonly, task force, is a special committee, usually of [[expert]]s, formed expressly for the purpose of studying a particular problem. The task force usually performs some sort of an [[audit]] to assess the current situation, then draws up a list of all the current problems present and evaluates which ones merit fixing and which ones are actually fixable. The task force would then formulate a set of solutions to the problems and pick the "best" solution to each problem, as determined by some set of standards. For example, a task force set up to eliminate excessive government spending might consider a "best" solution to be one that saves the most money. Normally, the task force then presents its findings and proposed solutions to the institution that called for its formation; it is then up to the institution itself to actually act upon the task force's recommendations.

==Other data regarding US task forces==
* Some task forces are named after their commander, such as [[Dunsterforce]].
* [[Task Force Tarawa]], the name given the [[2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade]] during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. They were a [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]] commanded by Brigadier General Richard Natonski, attached to the [[I Marine Expeditionary Force]].
* [[Task Force Leatherneck]] is the name given the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade during their 2009 operations in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. They are a Marine Air-Ground Task Force commanded by Brigadier General Larry Nicholson, assigned to work under the [[International Security Assistance Force]].
* US Army [[Task Force Lethal]] is the name for 2-12 Infantry battalion out of Fort Carson, Colorado. Part of the Army's 4th Infantry Division, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment Task Force Lethal. Some of the heaviest firefights US troops were engaged in were in the Kunar province by teams of Task Force Lethal, there to replace members of the 173rd Airborne units and their outpost Restrepo.  Task Force Lethal is assigned to work as part of the International Security Assistance Force.  Task Force Lethal prides itself as one of the Army's premier multi-task light Infantry units that has trained at home in the mountainous regions of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and excels at high altitude warfare.  The commandos of Task Force Lethal have remained one of the US Army's most elite task forces in the Global War on Terror since the start in 2003.
* [[Task Force 1-41 Infantry]] was a U.S. Army heavy battalion task force which took part in the [[Gulf War]] of January–March 1991. Task Force 1-41 Infantry was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991 and conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991. It consisted primarily of the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, 3rd Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, and the 4th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, all being part of the 2nd Armored Division (Forward), based at Lucius D. Clay Kaserne, 24 kilometres (15&amp;nbsp;mi) north of Bremen, in the Federal Republic of Germany.

== Task forces in popular culture ==

* In ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]'', some of the main characters are from an elite, international special operations task force called Task Force 141.
* In ''[[City of Heroes]]'', a task force was a large-scale story arc of several missions in which 3–8 players took part in, often resulting in a climatic battle against the villain of the story arc.
* In the TV series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', Steven "Steve" McGarrett created the so-called "Five-O Task Force" which was a group of [[state police]] based in [[Hawaii]], hence ''Hawaii Five-O''.
*In the fifth ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' movie, ''The Strongest Rivals'', Coora, the older brother of Freeza, has assembled a group known as the "Coora Task Force". The naming comes from official Japanese merchandise for the movie.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern instances of terror include [[Red Terror (disambiguation)|red terror]] or [[White Terror (disambiguation)|white terror]].

Before the late twentieth century, the term ''"terrorism"'' in the English language was often used interchangeably with "''terror''." Some contemporary writers use terrorism to refer to acts by groups with a limited political base or parties on the weaker side in [[asymmetric warfare]] and terror to acts by governments and [[law enforcement]] officials, usually within the legal framework of the state. Others consider state terror to be a specific type of terrorism.

==Revolutionary and counter-revolutionary terror==
{{Main|Revolutionary terror}}
[[Revolutionary terror]], also known as ''"[[Red terror]]"'', was often used by revolutionary governments to suppress [[counterrevolutionaries]]. The first example was the [[Reign of Terror]] during the [[French Revolution]] in 1794.&lt;ref&gt;"Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy", by Barrington Moore, Edward Friedman, James C. Scott (1993) {{ISBN|0-8070-5073-3}}, p.101: "Social Consequences of  Revolutionary Terror"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April08/Lafayette.cov.cn.html French revolutionary terror was a gross exaggeration, say Lafayette experts. By Chandni Navalkha.] April 28, 2008. accessed 5-20-2009&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable examples include the ''[[Red Terror]]'' in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] in 1918–1922, as well as simultaneous campaigns [[Red Terror (Hungary)|in the Hungarian Soviet Republic]] and [[Red Terror (Finland)|in Finland]]. In China [[Red Terror (China)|Red Terror]] in 1966 and 1967 started the [[Cultural revolution]]. 

Counterrevolutionary terror is usually referred to as ''"[[White Terror (disambiguation)|white terror]]"''. Notable examples are the terror campaigns [[First White Terror|in France]] (1794–1795), [[White Terror (Russia)|in Russia]] (1917–20), [[White Terror (Hungary)|in Hungary]] (1919–1921), and [[White Terror (Spain)|in Spain]]. Modern examples of counter-revolutionary terror include [[Operation Condor]] in South America.

==Terror and terrorism==
{{Terrorism}}
David Forte states that the primary difference between terror and [[terrorism]] is that while terror can be neutrally evil (i.e., random violence committed by [[robbers]], [[rapists]], and even [[military personnel]]), terrorism has the additional political or moral dimension, being the systematized use of randomly focused violence by organized groups against [[non-combatants]] to effect a political objective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Forte |first1=David F.|last2= |first2= |year=1986 |title=Terror and Terrorism: There Is a Difference |journal=Ohio Northern University Law Review |volume=13 |issue= |pages=39–52 |publisher=Ohio Northern University Pettit College of Law |doi= |url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/onulr13&amp;div=13&amp;id=&amp;page= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However Charles Tilly defines "terror" as a political strategy defined as "asymmetrical deployment of threats and violence against enemies using means that fall outside the forms of political struggle routinely operating within some current regime," and therefore ranges from:&lt;ref&gt;Charles Tilly. Terror, Terrorism, Terrorists. ''Sociological Theory'', Vol. 22, No. 1, Theories of Terrorism: A Symposium (Mar., 2004), pp. 5-13&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#intermittent actions by members of groups that are engaged in wider political struggles to
#one segment in the modus operandi of durably organized specialists in coercion, including government-employed and government-backed specialists in coercion to
#the dominant rationale for distinct, committed groups and networks of activists.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Tilly, the term "terror" spans across a wide range of human cruelties, from Stalin's use of executions to clandestine attacks by groups like the Basque separatists and the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] and even ethnic cleansing and genocide&lt;ref&gt;Tilly, p9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Buddha]] identified the '''threefold training''' (''sikkhā'')&lt;ref&gt;See the [[Anguttara Nikaya]] Book of Threes' (''Tikanipata'') Monks chapter (''Samanavagga'').  This chapter's [[Sūtra|sutta]]s are alternately identified as AN 3:82 to 3:92.  Of these suttas, the two most widely translated into English are AN 3:88 and 3:89, respectively referred to as "Sikkha (1)" and "Sikkha (2)" by [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], and as "Dutiyasikkhasuttam" and "Tatiyasikkhasuttam" in the Sinhalese canon.  English translations of these latter two suttas can be found in: Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi (1999), pp. 69-71; Thanissaro (1998a); and, Thanissaro (1998b).

And, knowing them, he, the Buddha, to his monks has taught the Dhamma.&lt;br /&gt;
He, the destroyer of suffering, the Master, the Seer, is at peace."
|}
&lt;/ref&gt; as training in:
* higher [[Śīla|virtue]] (''adhisīla-sikkhā'')
* higher [[Samadhi (Buddhism)|mind]] (''adhicitta-sikkhā'')
* higher [[Wisdom in Buddhism|wisdom]] (''adhipaññā-sikkhā'')

== In the Pali Canon ==

According to [[Theravada]] [[Pali Canon|canonical texts]], pursuing this training leads to the abandonment of [[kilesa|lust, hatred, and delusion]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.088.than.html AN 3:88] (Thanissaro, 1998a).&lt;/ref&gt;  One who is fully accomplished in this training attains [[Nibbana]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.089.than.html AN 3.89] (Thanissaro, 1998b).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Anguttara Nikaya]], training in "higher virtue" includes following the [[Patimokkha]], training in "higher mind" (sometimes simply referred to as "concentration") includes entering and dwelling in the four [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhanas]], and training in "higher wisdom" includes directly perceiving the [[Four Noble Truths]] or knowledge of destruction of the taints. &lt;ref&gt;AN 3.85, [https://suttacentral.net/en/an3.89 AN 3.89], [https://suttacentral.net/en/an3.90 AN 3.90]&lt;/ref&gt;

In several [[Pali Canon|canonical]] discourses, a more "gradual" instruction (''[[anupubbikatha|anupubbikathā]]'') is provided to receptive lay people (see also, [[gradual training]]).  This latter instruction culminates in the teaching of the Four Noble Truths which in itself concludes with the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], the constituents of which can be mapped to this threefold training (see below).

=== Similarity to threefold partition of the Noble Eightfold Path ===
The Buddha's threefold training is similar to the threefold grouping of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] articulated by [[Bhikkhuni]] Dhammadinna in Culavedalla Sutta ("The Shorter Set of Questions-And-Answers Discourse," [[Majjhima Nikaya|MN]] 44): virtue (''sīlakkhandha''), concentration (''samādhikkhandha''), wisdom (''paññākkhandha '').&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro (1998c).&lt;/ref&gt;  These three-part schemes simplify and organize the [[Eightfold Path]] as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8733">A '''Total Maximum Daily Load''' (TMDL) is a regulatory term in the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]], describing a plan for restoring impaired waters that identifies the maximum amount of a [[pollutant]] that a [[body of water]] can receive while still meeting [[Clean Water Act#Water Quality Standards Program|water quality standards]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Clean Water Act, sec. 303(d), {{USCSub|33|1313|d}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and federal agency responsibilities==
The Clean Water Act requires that state environmental agencies complete TMDLs for impaired waters and that the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) review and approve / disapprove those TMDLs.&lt;ref name="EPA overview"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/tmdl/program-overview-impaired-waters-and-tmdls |title=Program Overview: Impaired Waters and TMDLs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-11-28 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because both state and federal governments are involved in completing TMDLs, the TMDL program is an example of [[cooperative federalism]]. If a state doesn't take action to develop TMDLs, or if EPA disapproves state-developed TMDLs, the EPA is responsible for issuing TMDLs. EPA published regulations in 1992 establishing TMDL procedures.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. "Water Quality Planning and Management: Total maximum daily loads (TMDL) and individual water quality-based effluent limitations." ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{uscfr|40|130|7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Application of TMDLs has broadened significantly in the last decade to include many watershed-scale efforts, including the [[Chesapeake Bay]] TMDL. TMDLs identify all [[point source pollution|point source]] and [[Nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint source]] pollutants within a [[drainage basin|watershed]].

==State inventories==
The Clean Water Act requires states to compile lists of water bodies that do not fully support [[beneficial use]]s such as [[aquatic life]], [[fisheries]], [[drinking water]], recreation, industry, or [[agriculture]]; and to prioritize those water bodies for TMDL development. These inventories are known as '''303(d) Lists''' and characterize waters as '''fully supporting,''' '''impaired,''' or in some cases '''threatened''' for beneficial uses.

==Planning process==
Beneficial use determinations must have sufficient credible [[water quality]] data for TMDL planning.

Throughout the U.S., data are often lacking adequate spatial or temporal coverage to reliably establish the sources and magnitude of water quality degradation.

TMDL planning in large watersheds is a process that typically involves the following steps:  
# Watershed Characterization—understanding the basic physical, environmental, and human elements of the watershed.
# Impairment Status—analyzing existing data to determine if waters fully support beneficial uses
# Data Gaps and Monitoring Report—identification of any additional data needs and [[water quality#Sampling and measurement|monitoring]] recommendations
# Source Assessment—identification of sources of pollutants, and magnitude of sources.
# Load Allocation—determination of natural pollutant load, and load from human activities (i.e. diffuse nonpoint sources and point discharges).
# Set Targets—establishment of water quality targets intended to restore or maintain beneficial uses.
# TMDL Implementation Plan—a watershed management strategy to attain established targets.

===Water quality targets===
The purpose of water quality targets is to protect or restore beneficial uses and protect human health.  These targets may include state/federal numerical water quality standards or narrative standards, i.e. within the range of "natural" conditions.  Establishing targets to restore beneficial uses is challenging and sometimes controversial.  For example, the restoration of a fishery may require reducing temperatures, nutrients, sediments, and improving habitat.

Necessary values for each pollutant target to restore fisheries can be uncertain.  The potential for a water body to support a fishery even in a pristine state can be uncertain.

===Background===
Calculating the TMDL for any given body of water involves the combination of factors that contribute to the problem of nutrient concentrated runoff.  Bodies of water are tested for contaminants based on their intended use.  Each body of water is tested similarly but designated with a different TMDL. Drinking water reservoirs are designated differently from areas for public swimming and water bodies intended for fishing are designated differently from water located in wildlife conservation areas.  The size of the water body also is taken into consideration when TMDL calculating is undertaken.  The larger the body of water, the greater the amounts of contaminants can be present and still maintain a Margin of Safety.  The ''Margin of Safety (MOS)'' is numeric estimate included in the TMDL calculation, sometimes 10% of the TMDL, intended to allow a safety buffer between the calculated TMDL and the actual load that will allow the water body to meet its beneficial use (since the natural world is complex and several variables may alter future conditions).  TMDL is the end product of all point and non-point source pollutants of a single contaminant.  Pollutants that originate from a point source are given allowable levels of contaminants to be discharged; this is the ''Waste Load Allocation (WLA).''  Nonpoint source pollutants are also calculated into the TMDL equation with ''Load Allocation (LA).''

===Calculation===
The calculation of a TMDL is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;TMDL = WLA + LA + MOS&lt;/math&gt;
where WLA is the waste load allocation for point sources, LA is the load allocation for nonpoint sources, and MOS is the margin of safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A. Shirmohammadi |author2=I. Chaubey |author3=R. D. Harmel |author4=D. D. Bosch |author5=R. Muñoz-Carpena |author6=C. Dharmasri |author7=A. Sexton |author8=M. Arabi |author9=M. L. Wolfe |author10=J. Frankenberger |author11=C. Graff |author12=T. M. Sohrabi |title=Uncertainty in TMDL Models |journal=Transactions of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers |year=2006 |volume=49 |issue=4 |doi=10.13031/2013.21741 |pages=1033–1049|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=1403&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Load allocations===
Load allocations are equally challenging as setting targets.  Load allocations provide a framework for determining the relative share of natural sources and human sources of pollution.

The natural background load for a pollutant may be imprecisely understood. Industrial dischargers, [[farming|farmers]], [[land development|land developers]], [[Local government in the United States|municipalities]], natural resource agencies, and other watershed stakeholders each have a vested interest in the outcome.

==Implementation==
To implement TMDLs with point sources, wasteload allocations are incorporated into discharge permits for these sources.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. [https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-permit-writers-manual ''NPDES Permit Writers' Manual.''] "Chapter 6: Water Quality-Based Effluent Limitations." September 2010. Document No. EPA-833-K-10-001.&lt;/ref&gt; The permits are issued by EPA or delegated state agencies under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ([[NPDES]]). [[Nonpoint source pollution|Nonpoint source discharges]] (e.g. agriculture) are generally in a voluntary compliance scenario.  The TMDL implementation plan is intended to help bridge this divide and ensure that watershed beneficial uses are restored and maintained. Local watershed groups play a critical role in educating stakeholders, generating funding, and implementing projects to reduce nonpoint sources of pollution.

[[File:US trewartha.svg|350px|thumb|Trewartha climate types for the contiguous United States]]

The '''Trewartha climate classification''' is a [[climate classification]] system first published by American geographer [[Glenn Thomas Trewartha]] in 1966. It is a modified version of the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger system]], created to answer some of its deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;Peel MC, Finlayson BL, McMahon TA (2007) Updated world map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification. Hydrol Earth Syst Sci 11: 1633–1644&lt;/ref&gt; The Trewartha system attempts to redefine the middle latitudes to be closer to [[vegetation]] zoning and genetic [[climate]] systems. It was considered a more true or "real world" reflection of the global climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Akin, Wallace E. | year = 1991 | title = Global Patterns: Climate, Vegetation, and Soils | page = 52 | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | isbn=0-8061-2309-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The changes were seen as most effective on the large landmasses in [[Asia]] and [[North America]], where many areas fall into a single group (''C'') in the Köppen-Geiger system.&lt;ref&gt;Köppen, 1936, Trewartha &amp; Horn 1980, Bailey 2009, Baker et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, under the standard Köppen system, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] are classed into the same climate zone (''Csb'') as parts of [[Southern California]], even though the two regions have strikingly different weather and vegetation.  Another example was classifying cities like [[London]] in the same climate group (''C'') as [[Brisbane]] or [[New Orleans]], despite great differences in seasonal temperatures and native plant life.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey RG (2009) Ecosystem geography:from ecoregions to sites, 2nd edn. Springer, New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheme==
Trewartha's modifications to the 1899 Köppen climate system sought to reclass the middle latitudes into three groups: ''C'' ([[Subtropics|subtropical]])—8 or more months have a mean temperature of {{convert|10|C}} or higher; ''D'' [[temperate]]—4 to 7 months have a mean temperature of 10 °C or higher; and  ''E'' [[boreal climate]]—1 to 3 months have a mean temperature of 10 °C or higher. Otherwise, the tropical climates and polar climates remained the same as the original Köppen climate classification.  

===Group A: Tropical climates===
This the [[tropical climate]] realm, defined the same as in Köppen's scheme (i.e., all 12 months average {{convert|18|C|F|disp=comma}}, or above). The "A" climates are the realm of the winterless frost-free zone. 

Climates with no more than two dry months (defined as having less than {{convert|60|mm|in|disp=comma|abbr=in}}, average precipitation, same as per Köppen) are classified ''Ar'', while others are classified ''Aw'' if the [[dry season]] is at the time of low sun/short days or ''As'' if the dry season is at the time of high sun/long days. There was no specific [[monsoon climate]] identifier in the original scheme, but ''Am'' was added later, with the same parameters as Köppen's (except that at least three months, rather than one, must have less than 60&amp;nbsp;mm average precipitation).

===Group B: Dry (arid and semi-arid) climates===  
''BW'' and ''BS'' mean the same as in the Köppen scheme, with the Köppen ''BWn'' climate sometimes being designated ''BM'' (the ''M'' standing for "marine"). However, a different formula is used to quantify the aridity threshold: 10(''T'' − 10) + 3''P'', with ''T'' equaling the mean annual temperature in degrees Celsius and ''P'' denoting the percentage of total precipitation received in the six high-sun months (April through September in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and October through March in the Southern).&lt;ref&gt;Patton CP (1962) A note on the classification of dry climate in the Köppen system. California Geographer 3: 105–112&lt;/ref&gt; 

If the precipitation for a given location is less than the above formula, its climate is said to be that of a desert (''BW''); if it is equal to or greater than the above formula but less than twice that amount, the climate is classified as steppe (''BS''); and if the precipitation is more than double the value of the formula the climate is not in Group B. Unlike in Köppen's scheme, no thermal subsets exist within this group in Trewartha's, unless the Universal Thermal Scale (see below) is used.

===Group C: Subtropical climates===
In the Trewartha scheme the "C" climate group encompasses [[Subtropical]] climates that have 8 or more months with a mean temperature of {{convert|10|C|F}} or higher. 

There are only two types within the "C" or subtropical climate group,  ''Cs'' which is a dry -summer or Mediterranean climate, and a ''Cf'' or humid Subtropical climate. ''Cw'' types occur within the Cf group and mean subtropical Monsoon climates (like much of east Asia).

===Group D: Temperate and continental climates===
In the Trewartha scheme the "D"  climate group encompasses [[Temperate climate]]s that have 4 to 7 months with a mean temperature of {{convert|10|C|F}} or higher. 

"D" climate groups have two types – an Oceanic type (Do), where the coldest month has a mean temperature {{convert|0|C|F}} or higher, and a Continental type (Dc), where the coldest monthly mean temperature reaches below 0 °C in some interior landmasses like North America and Asia. 

For the continental climates (Dc), sometimes the third letter (''a'' or ''b'') is used to denote a hot or cold summer. "Dca" is where the warmest month has a mean temperature of {{convert|22.2|C|F}} or higher, and "Dcb" is used for cool summer temperate climates, where the warmest month has a mean temperature below 22.2 °C.

===Group E: Boreal climates===
This represents [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] and [[subpolar oceanic climate|subpolar oceanic]] climate realms, defined the same as in Köppen's scheme, where 1 to 3 months have an average temperature of {{convert|10|C|F}} or above. In this climate zone there is only a short period (normally 50 to 90 days) that is frost free. In the original scheme, this group was not further divided; later, the designations ''Eo'' and ''Ec'' were created, with ''Eo'' (maritime subarctic) signifying that the coldest month averages above {{convert|−10|C|F}}, while ''Ec'' (continental subarctic or "boreal") means that at least one month has an average temperature of −10 °C or below. As in Group D, a third letter can be added to indicate seasonality of precipitation. There is no separate counterpart to the Köppen ''Dfd'', ''Dwd'', and ''Dsd'' climate types in Trewartha's scheme, but a letter can optionally be added to the end of the symbol to indicate the temperature of the coldest month ([[#Universal Thermal Scale|see below]]).

===Group F: Polar climates===
This is the [[polar climate]] group, where all months must have a monthly mean air temperature of below 10°C/50 F. Polar climates have two subtypes ''Ft'' ([[tundra]]) and ''Fi'' ([[ice cap]]):

In the "Ft" climate type, at least one month has an average temperate above {{convert|0|C|F|disp=or}} (but not above 10 °C), so that there is a brief time when the surface might be free of snow or ice and a scrub or Tundra vegetation cover is possible.

In the "Fi" climate type, all months have an average temperature below 0 °C, this is the region of the vast deserts of perpetually frozen Ocean in the North Pole, and the permanent ice plateaus of Antarctica and Greenland.

===Group H: Highland climates===
[[Highland climate]]s are those in which [[altitude]] plays a role in determining climate classification.&lt;ref&gt;McKnight, 237–40&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, this would apply if correcting the average temperature of each month to a [[sea-level]] value using the formula of adding {{convert|5.6|C-change|F-change}} for each {{convert|1,000|m|ft|sp=us}} of elevation would result in the climate fitting into a different thermal group than that into which the actual monthly temperatures place it. 

Sometimes ''G'' is used instead of ''H'' if the above is true and the altitude is between {{convert|500|and|2,500|m|ft|sp=us}}, but the ''G'' or ''H'' is placed in front of the applicable thermal letter rather than replacing it. The second letter used reflects the ''corrected'' monthly temperatures, not the actual monthly temperatures. G stands for glacier for instances.

==Universal Thermal Scale== 
An option exists to include information on both the warmest and coldest months for every climate by adding a third and fourth letter, respectively. The letters used conform to the following scale:
:''i'' — severely hot: Mean monthly temperature ≥{{convert|35|C|0}} or higher
:''h'' — very hot: {{convert|28|to|34.9|C|F|1}}&lt;br&gt;''a'' — hot: {{convert|22.2|to|27.9|C|F|1}}
:''b'' — warm: {{convert|18|to|22.1|C|F|1}}&lt;br&gt;''l'' — mild: {{convert|10|to|17.9|C|F|1}}&lt;br&gt;''k'' — cool: {{convert|0.1|to|9.9|C|F|1}}&lt;br&gt;''o'' — cold: {{convert|−9.9|to|0|C|F|1}}&lt;br&gt;''c'' — very cold: {{convert|−24.9|to|−10|C|F|1}}&lt;br&gt;''d'' — severely cold: {{convert|−39.9|to|−25|C|F|1}}&lt;br&gt;''e'' — excessively cold: {{convert|-40|C}} or below.&lt;br&gt;

Examples of the resulting designations include ''BWil'' for [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]]; ''BWhb'' for [[Aswan]], Egypt; ''Awha'' for [[Surabaya]], [[Indonesia]]; ''Cfak'' for [[Tokyo]]; ''Csll'' for [[San Francisco]], [[California]]; ''Cfhk'' for [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], U.S.; ''DObk'' for [[London]]; ''EClc'' for [[Arkhangelsk]], Russia; ''FTkd'' for [[Utqiagvik, Alaska|Utqiagvik]], [[Alaska]], U.S.; ''Cfbl'' for [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]; and ''FIce'' for [[Vostok Station]] in Antarctica.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5784">In [[mathematics]], a '''Waldhausen category''' is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''C'' equipped with some additional data, which makes it possible to construct the [[K-theory of a category|K-theory]] [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] of ''C'' using a so-called '''S-construction'''. It's named after [[Friedhelm Waldhausen]], who introduced this notion (under the term '''category with cofibrations and weak equivalences''') to extend the methods of [[algebraic K-theory]] to categories not necessarily of algebraic origin, for example the category of [[topological space]]s.

==Definition==
Let ''C'' be a category, co(''C'') and we(''C'') two classes of [[morphism]]s in ''C'', called cofibrations and weak equivalences respectively. The triple (''C'', co(''C''), we(''C'')) is called a '''Waldhausen category''' if it satisfies the following axioms, motivated by the similar properties for the notions of [[cofibration]]s and [[weak equivalence (homotopy theory)#Topological_spaces|weak homotopy equivalences]] of topological spaces:

* ''C'' has a [[zero object]], denoted by 0;
* [[isomorphism]]s are included in both co(''C'') and we(''C'');
* co(''C'') and we(''C'') are closed under composition;
* for each object ''A'' ∈ ''C'' the unique map 0 → ''A'' is a cofibration, i.e. is an element of co(''C'');
* co(''C'') and we(''C'') are compatible with [[pushout (category theory)|pushouts]] in a certain sense.

For example, if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A\, \rightarrowtail\, B&lt;/math&gt; is a cofibration and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A\,\to\, C&lt;/math&gt; is any map, then there must exist a pushout &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle B\, \cup_A\, C&lt;/math&gt;, and the natural map &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C\, \rightarrowtail\, B\,\cup_A\, C&lt;/math&gt; should be cofibration:

==Relations with other notions==
In [[algebraic K-theory]] and [[homotopy theory]] there are several notions of categories equipped with some specified classes of morphisms.  If ''C'' has a structure of an [[exact category]], then by defining we(''C'') to be isomorphisms, co(''C'') to be admissible monomorphisms, one obtains a structure of a Waldhausen category on ''C''. Both kinds of structure may be used to define [[K-theory of a category|K-theory]] of ''C'', using the [[Q-construction]] for an exact structure and [[S-construction]] for a Waldhausen structure. An important fact is that the resulting K-theory spaces are homotopy equivalent.

If ''C'' is a [[model category]] with a zero object, then the full subcategory of cofibrant objects in ''C'' may be given a Waldhausen structure.

== S-construction ==
The '''Waldhausen S-construction''' produces from a Waldhausen category ''C'' a sequence of [[Kan complex]]es &lt;math&gt;S_n(C)&lt;/math&gt;, which forms a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]]. Let &lt;math&gt;K(C)&lt;/math&gt; denote the loop space of the geometric realization &lt;math&gt;|S_*(C)|&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;S_*(C)&lt;/math&gt;. Then the [[group (mathematics)|group]]
:&lt;math&gt;\pi_n K(C) = \pi_{n+1} |S_*(C)|&lt;/math&gt;
is the ''n''-th ''K''-group of ''C''. Thus, it gives a way to define higher ''K''-groups. Another approach for higher ''K''-theory is [[Quillen's Q-construction]].

The construction is due to [[Friedhelm Waldhausen]].

==biWaldhausen categories==

A category ''C'' is equipped with bifibrations if it has cofibrations and its [[opposite category]] ''C''&lt;sup&gt;OP&lt;/sup&gt; has so also. In that case, we denote the fibrations of ''C''&lt;sup&gt;OP&lt;/sup&gt; by quot(''C''). 
In that case, ''C'' is a '''biWaldhausen category''' if ''C'' has [[bifibration]]s and weak equivalences such that both (''C'',&amp;nbsp;co(''C''),&amp;nbsp;we) and (''C''&lt;sup&gt;OP&lt;/sup&gt;,&amp;nbsp;quot(''C''),&amp;nbsp;we&lt;sup&gt;OP&lt;/sup&gt;) are Waldhausen categories.

Waldhausen and biWaldhausen categories are linked with [[algebraic K-theory]]. There, many interesting categories are complicial biWaldhausen categories. For example: 
The category &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C^b(\mathcal{A})&lt;/math&gt; of bounded chain complexes on an exact category &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;.
The category &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle S_n \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; of functors &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \operatorname{Ar}(\Delta ^n)\, \to\, \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is so.
And given a diagram &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle I&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{C}^I&lt;/math&gt; is a nice complicial biWaldhausen category when &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; is.
