'''A-100''' is the colloquial name given to the introductory/orientation training class for incoming [[Foreign Service Officer]]s. These courses are taught in the [[Foreign Service Institute]] at the [[National Foreign Affairs Training Center]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia. The purpose of the class is to provide orientation to the [[United States Department of State]], information on [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|embassy]] operation and foreign affairs, intelligence collection and dissemination, State Department computer systems, and the roles different categories of personnel perform in the conduct of [[diplomacy]]. It is the basic job-orientation course for the [[United States Foreign Service]] before diplomats branch off into different career tracks or geographic specialties.

==Training==

The class ranges from five to six weeks long and typically has between 75 and 100 students. During the first day of the class, students learn about their classmates and give presentations on them. The first week of the class is devoted to security briefings, the issuing of [[laptop]]s and State Department [[identification cards]], and indoctrination into the more classified aspects of the Foreign Service. The class is an opportunity to learn about the Foreign Service, not a discussion forum for foreign policy; as public servants, Foreign Service Officers, when acting in their official capacity, are obligated to defend publicly and to implement the foreign policy directives and objectives of the [[federal government of the United States]], notwithstanding any personal or political reservations.&lt;ref&gt;Of course, FSOs are free to hold whatever political beliefs they may have, and to participate in the U.S. political process in their capacity as private citizens, but they cannot let their personal views influence their actions or words in their official capacity. A [[Dissent Channel|dissent channel]] for FSOs exists to make their professional opinions known about foreign policy issues with which they have a professional difference of opinion, and policy has been known to have been changed as the result of the use of this channel. One famous example of the use of this channel involves the [[Blood telegram|Blood Telegram]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]; other uses that are also publicly known or alluded to include dissents with regard to policy in the Balkans following the collapse of Yugoslavia.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent weeks examine State Department organizational structure, drafting and editing, the organizational structure of an Embassy, public speaking, and protocol. While the majority of the class takes place at the [[National Foreign Affairs Training Center]], there are some field trips to other U.S. government foreign affairs agencies, as well as off site team-building training that lasts for two days and normally takes place at a military base in [[West Virginia]].

Towards the end of the course, students are informed of their first assignments, usually overseas, during the "Flag Day" ceremony, so named because they are presented with a small flag of the country to which they have been assigned. After A-100, additional training is personalized to the individual depending on his or her overseas posting and/or language ability and post requirements.

Members often maintain contact with each other throughout their entire careers, and regard A-100 classmates much like high school or college classmates. A-100 classes are numbered sequentially. The class numbers were restarted with the enactment of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, and several groups have shared numbers over the years.

==History==
In function, if not name, the A-100 Class dates back to June 7, 1924, when President Coolidge issued Executive Order 4022 establishing a Foreign Service School for the purpose of training newly hired probationary Foreign Service Officers (FSOs).  The Foreign Service School's first class was conducted from April 20 until September 1, 1925, and "graduated" a class of 17.

According to tradition, the "100" in A-100 refers to the number of the room in which the course was first conducted.  The State Department's 1926 Telephone Directory confirms that the Foreign Service School was located in Room 100 of the State, War, and Navy Building.

Additional details can be found in Ambassador Ellis O. Briggs' autobiography: ''Proud Servant: The Memoirs of a Career Ambassador''. Ambassador Briggs recounts his experiences in preparing for the 1925 Foreign Service examination—the written and oral tests that were instituted after the [[Rogers Act]] of 1924 established the Foreign Service as "a competitive, nonpolitical, professional career". Ambassador Briggs says that "simultaneously there came into existence in the Department of State, in Room 100 on the ground floor of the old State War Navy Building, a modest enterprise called the Foreign Service School". He goes on to explain that, in order to provide new officers with an initial "home office indoctrination" and avoid the problems that might result if officers' initial training was entirely entrusted to overseas supervisors whose quality and interest level "varied from post to post", it was decided to organize "a course of several months in the State Department before a new officer was sent to his first foreign assignment". Ambassador Briggs concludes that "until after World War II, the Foreign Service School remained an unpretentious institution, concentrating on unraveling consular regulations and language instruction".

With the Foreign Service Act of 1946 a new Foreign Service training program, patterned after programs in the Army and Navy, came into existence.  The newly established [[Foreign Service Institute]] (FSI) included a "School of Basic Officer Training" (with classes distinguished by the letter "B" preceding a three-digit course number).  An "A" prefix was used to identify courses administered by the separate "School of Advanced Officer Training".  FSI's 1949 Course Catalog includes "B 100"—a basic training course prescribed for all newly appointed Foreign Service officers.  The separate "A 100" course involved three months of intensive training for Foreign Service officers following the successful conclusion of their probationary years in the field.

By 1955, however, these separate schools had been eliminated.  In the 1955–56 FSI course catalog, the training programs for junior, mid-level, and senior-level officers are all found under the heading of "General Career Training". The B-100 course had vanished, but A-100 survived as the three-month "Junior Foreign Service Officers' Course" which was "required of all newly appointed Foreign Service officers of class 6 before assignment to their first post abroad".

==History==
ANU is a private Christian University and an institution of the [[Church of the Nazarene|Church of the Nazarene International]], whose mission and vision follows the [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan Holiness Tradition]]. It was established to prepare leaders for the Church both at ministerial and laity level. The Church of the Nazarene sought to address the challenges witnessed in African society in the early 1980s through an institution of higher education. In accordance with the Kenya University’s Act of 1985, (provision for establishment of private universities in Kenya), the Church settled on Kenya as a location to start a Nazarene University which became the first one outside North America.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

In July 1993, the Board of the Church granted its authority for the establishment of a university in Africa following a unanimous vote by its members during a General Assembly in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. The Church, through the university’s founders, continued to pursue negotiations with the Commission of University Education, then Commission of Higher Education (CHE) to establish a degree awarding institution. Therefore, the legal authority to establish the university was given on November 23, 1993, when CHE issued, on behalf of the Kenyan Government, a Letter of Interim Authority for the university to start laying the foundation for the development of ANU.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

In August 1994 Dr. Martha John, ANU’s first Vice Chancellor, opened the university’s doors to 62 students from eleven African countries taking undergraduate courses in Theology and Business Administration and a Masters of Arts in Religion. One year later, the university introduced the Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, welcoming an additional 42 students.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

Professor Leah Marangu took over from Dr. John in January 1996 and was installed as Vice Chancellor in February 1997. On 8 October 2002, the university was granted the Charter (Accreditation Credentials) by the [[government of Kenya]], making ANU the first private university to receive the credential under the new act and without being affiliated with any other university locally and abroad.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

==Academics==
The university is composed of the following schools:&lt;ref name="Three"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.anu.ac.ke/#nogo | title=Africa Nazarene University: Schools |date=8 January 2018 |accessdate=8 January 2018 | publisher=Africa Nazarene University (ANU) |author=ANU}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* School of Religion and Christian Ministry
* School of Science and Technology
* School of Humanities and Social Sciences

Starting off with three programs, the university now has 36 programs, offered at nine campuses, as of January 2018.&lt;ref name="Four"/&gt;

She grew up in [[Holliston, Massachusetts]], and graduated from [[Holliston High School]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} While attending [[Skidmore College]] in 1997, Townsend-Small spent a semester at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] as part of the Semester in Environmental Science program.&lt;!-- The source cited here only states that she attended Skidmore; it mentions nothing about the Marine Biological Laboratory --&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/ses/alumni/ses-alumni-list-by-college/|title=SES Alumni List by College|website=www.mbl.edu|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this semester she produced a research project investigating the use of [[nitrogen]] stable [[isotope]]s as tracers of wastewater inputs to groundwater, and has continued to work with isotopes and marine environments since.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1998, Townsend-Small graduated ''[[Magna cum Laude|magna cum laude]]'' from [[Skidmore College]], receiving a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's degree]] in both [[English literature]] and [[environmental biology]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; She received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Marine Science|marine science]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 2006, where she had done dissertation research investigating carbon cycling and its relationship with climate in the [[Amazon River]] headwaters of [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|others=|title=Carbon and nitrogen cycling in the Peruvian Andean Amazon|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/13069|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and research ==
Townsend-Small's dissertation research focused on examining the [[particulate organic matter]] (POM) carried downstream by rivers from the [[Andes|Andes Mountains]] in [[Peru]] to the [[Amazon River]], paying special attention to the elemental and isotopic compositions of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] in the POM.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; After receiving her PhD, Townsend-Small worked at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] as a Postdoctoral Researcher studying the connection between [[Climate change|changing climate]] and the export of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and dissolved nutrients in rivers of the [[Alaska]]n Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend-Small|first=Amy|last2=McClelland|first2=James W.|last3=Max Holmes|first3=R.|last4=Peterson|first4=Bruce J.|date=2010-05-09|title=Seasonal and hydrologic drivers of dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the upper Kuparuk River, Alaskan Arctic|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-010-9451-4|journal=Biogeochemistry|language=en|volume=103|issue=1-3|pages=109–124|doi=10.1007/s10533-010-9451-4|issn=0168-2563}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Townsend-Small began working as a Postdoctoral Scholar and Project Scientist in the Department of Earth System Science at the [[University of California, Irvine|University of California Irvine]], where she conducted research regarding urban [[greenhouse gas]] and water budgets in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend-Small|first=Amy|last2=Pataki|first2=Diane E.|last3=Czimczik|first3=Claudia I.|last4=Tyler|first4=Stanley C.|date=2011|title=Nitrous oxide emissions and isotopic composition in urban and agricultural systems in southern California|url=https://utah.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/nitrous-oxide-emissions-and-isotopic-composition-in-urban-and-agr|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences|language=English|volume=116|issue=1|pages=G01013|doi=10.1029/2010JG001494|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, Townsend-Small has been at the [[University of Cincinnati]], where she is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Geology and Geography as well as the director of the Environmental Studies Program.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Her current research at [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] investigates [[Anthropogenic greenhouse gases|anthropogenic]] sources of [[methane]] and [[climate change]] feedbacks to the global [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Ramon A.|last2=Zavala-Araiza|first2=Daniel|last3=Lyon|first3=David R.|last4=Allen|first4=David T.|last5=Barkley|first5=Zachary R.|last6=Brandt|first6=Adam R.|last7=Davis|first7=Kenneth J.|last8=Herndon|first8=Scott C.|last9=Townsend-Small|first9=Amy|date=2018-06-21|title=Improved characterization of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain|url=https://www.nist.gov/publications/improved-characterization-methane-emissions-us-oil-and-gas-supply-chain|journal=Science Magazine|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ann-Marie Williams''' is a [[Belizeans|Belizean]] public policy advisor, administrator and former journalist. After spending over two decades as a reporter, Williams became the first Executive Director for the National Women's Commission of Belize. She serves as a governmental advisor to the legislature and executive on issues impacting women. She was honored with the US Secretary of State's Women in Public Service Award in 2011.

==Early life==
Ann-Marie Williams was born in [[Belize City]], Belize, the first daughter of a family of six siblings.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} She was raised by a single mother, who worked as a teacher and librarian.{{sfn|Downs|2017}} At the age of seventeen, Williams began working as an announcer at [[Radio Belize]], at the time, the only radio broadcaster in the country. Completing a course on journalism at the Caribbean Institute of Media and Communication through the [[University of the West Indies]],{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} she continued her education, earning a bachelor's degree from the [[University College of Belize]].{{sfn|''The Reporter''|2015}}

==Career==
In 1988, Williams won the Edison Coleman Award for a program she produced for radio and was among the first reporters to read the news for [[Radio Belize]]. In 1995, she began the newscasts at [[Krem Radio]], both writing and reading the news for a year. She went on to serve as a news anchor for Channel 3 and later at [[Great Belize Television|Channel 5]] television. In 2000, wanting to further her education, Williams attended the [[University of Sussex]] in England, earning a master's degree in gender and development. Upon completion of her degree, she returned to Belize and Channel 5. Perhaps her most remembered expose as a journalist was the breaking of the story on the sale of Belizean passports in 2002, for which she and Channel 5 received awards from the [[Caribbean Broadcasting Union]] for investigative journalism. In 2003, she became an editor at ''[[The Reporter (Belize)|The Reporter]]'' newspaper.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}}

In 2008, Williams left journalism when she was appointed by the government, as the first executive director of the public policy advisory board on gender, the National Women's Commission. In that capacity, she administered public policy which relates to women's issues and advises the government on policies which expand women's equal access.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} In one program she implemented, the Women in Politics Project, women are trained in the political process and requirements to be a public servant.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2012}} In 2011, from a pool of 200 international applicants, she received the US Secretary of State's Women in Public Service Award.{{sfn|''Ambergris Today''|2011}}

Williams and the National Women's Commission came under fire in 2013, after developing a revised gender policy for the country, from various church leaders, who were alarmed at the apparent inclusion of [[LGBT rights in Belize|Belize's LGBT community]].{{sfn|''News 5''|2013}} Williams' position was that the new policy included terminology to bring the document into line with the [[Constitution of Belize]], which bars discrimination.{{sfn|''News 5''|2013}}{{sfn|''7 News''|2013}} At the time, a court challenge to Belize's [[anti-sodomy law]] was pending with several of the church bodies as opponents to legalization.{{sfn|Scott|2015}} Despite the controversy, the cabinet approved the policy by consensus.{{sfn|Ramos|2013}} In 2014, Williams was named a "trailblazer" in the program launched by [[Kim Simplis Barrow]], Special Envoy for Women and Children.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} In 2015, she was awarded a Hubert Humphrey Fellowship and completed post-graduate studies at the [[American University Washington College of Law]] on [[human trafficking]].{{sfn|''The Reporter''|2015}} Williams launched an initiative for National Women's Commission in 2017 to reduce gender-based violence.{{sfn|''News 5''|2017}}

'''Aquatic respiration''' is the [[Biological process|process]] whereby an [[aquatic animal]] obtains [[oxygen]] from [[water]].

==Respiratory systems==

===Fish===
{{see also|Fish respiration}}

In most fish respiration takes place through [[Gills (biology)#Vertebrate gills|gills]]. [[Lungfish]], however, possess one or two lungs. The [[Anabantoidei|labyrinth fish]] have developed a special organ that allows them to take advantage of the oxygen of the air, but is not a true  lung. Fish use the process known as countercurrent flow, in which water and blood flow in opposite directions across the gills, maximizing the diffusion of oxygen.

===Molluscs===
{{see also|Respiratory system of gastropods}}

[[Molluscs]] generally possess gills that allow exchange of oxygen from an aqueous environment into the circulatory system. These animals also possess a heart that pumps blood which contains hemocyaninine as its oxygen-capturing molecule. Therefore, this respiratory system is similar to that of vertebrate fish. The [[respiratory system of gastropods]] can include either gills or a lung.

===Arthropods===
{{see also|Gill#Invertebrate gills}}

Aquatic [[arthropod]]s generally possess some form of gills in which gas exchange takes place by diffusing through the [[exoskeleton]]. Others may breathe atmospheric air while remaining submerged, via breathing tubes or trapped air bubbles, though some [[aquatic insect]]s may remain submerged indefinitely and respire using a [[Plastron (arthropod)|plastron]]. A very few [[Arachnid]]s have adopted an aquatic life style including the [[Diving bell spider]]. In all cases, oxygen is provided from air trapped by hairs around the animals body. 

===Aquatic reptiles===
All aquatic reptiles breathe air into lungs. The [[anatomy|anatomical structure]] of the [[lungs]] is less complex in [[reptiles]] than in [[mammals]], with reptiles lacking the very extensive  airway tree structure found in mammalian lungs. [[Gas exchange]] in reptiles still occurs in [[alveoli]] however, reptiles do not possess a [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]]. Thus, breathing occurs via a change in the volume of the body cavity which is controlled by contraction of [[intercostal muscle]]s in all reptiles except [[turtle]]s. In turtles, contraction of specific pairs of flank muscles governs [[inhalation|inspiration]] or [[Exhalation|expiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/498684/reptile/38473/Respiratory-system|title=reptile - animal|publisher=|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Reptiles#Respiration|reptiles]] for more detailed descriptions of the respiratory system in these animals.

===Amphibians===
{{see also|Amphibian#Respiratory system}}

Both the lungs and the [[Frog#Morphology and physiology|skin]] serve as respiratory organs in [[amphibians]]. The skin of these animals is highly vascularized and moist, with moisture maintained via secretion of [[mucus]] from specialized cells. While the lungs are of primary importance to breathing control, the skin's unique properties aid rapid gas exchange when amphibians are submerged in oxygen-rich water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Aquatic birds===
The respiratory system of birds differs significantly from that found in mammals, containing unique anatomical features such as [[air sacs]]. The lungs of birds also do not have the capacity to inflate as birds lack a [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] and a [[pleural cavity]]. Gas exchange in birds occurs between air capillaries and [[capillary|blood capillaries]], rather than in [[alveoli]]. See [[Bird anatomy#Respiratory system|Avian respiratory system]] for a detailed description of these and other features.

==Gills==
[[File:Tuna Gills in Situ 01.jpg|thumb|right|Posterior view of the gills of a [[tuna]]]]

Many aquatic animals have developed [[gill]]s for [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] which are specifically adapted to their function. In fish, for example, they have:
*A large [[surface area]] to allow as much [[oxygen]] to enter the gills as possible because more of the gas comes into contact with the [[Biological membrane|membrane]]
*Good [[Blood circulation|blood supply]] to maintain the concentration gradient needed
*Thin membrane to allow for a short diffusion pathway
*each gill arch has two rows (hemibranchs) of [[gill filament]]s
*each gill filament has many [[lamella (zoology)|lamella]]e
In [[osteichthyes]], the gills contain 4 [[gill arch]]es on each side of the head, two on each side for [[chondrichthyes]] or 7 gill baskets on each side of the fish's head in [[Lampreys]].
In fish, the long bony cover for the gill (the [[operculum (fish)|operculum]]) can be used for pushing water. Some fish pump water using the operculum.  Without an operculum, other methods, such as ram [[Ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]], are required. Some species of [[shark]]s use this system.  When they swim, water flows into the mouth and across the gills.  Because these sharks rely on this technique, they must keep swimming in order to respire.

Bony fish use [[Countercurrent exchange|countercurrent flow]] to maximize the intake of oxygen that can [[Diffusion|diffuse]] through the gill.  Countercurrent flow occurs when deoxygenated blood moves through the gill in one direction while oxygenated water moves through the gill in the opposite direction. This mechanism maintains the [[concentration gradient]] thus increasing the efficiency of the respiration process as well and prevents the oxygen levels from reaching an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]]. Cartilaginous fish do not have a countercurrent flow system as they lack bones which are needed to have the opened out gill that bony fish have.

==Control of respiration==
Scientists have investigated what part of the body is responsible for maintaining the respiratory rhythm. They found that [[neuron]]s located in the 
[[brainstem]] of fish are responsible for the genesis of the respiratory rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=David F.|title=Respiratory pattern generation in adult lampreys (Lampetra fluviatilis): interneurons and burst resetting|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A|date=1986|volume=158|issue=1|pages=91–102|doi=10.1007/BF00614523|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00614523}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The position of these neurons is slightly different from the centers of respiratory genesis in mammals but they are located in the same brain compartment, which has caused debates about the [[homology (biology)|homology]] of respiratory centers between aquatic and terrestrial species. In both aquatic and terrestrial respiration, the exact mechanisms by which neurons can generate this involuntary rhythm are still not completely understood (see [[Involuntary control of respiration]]).

Another important feature of the respiratory rhythm is that it is modulated to adapt to the oxygen consumption of the body. As observed in mammals, fish “breathe” faster and heavier when they do [[exercise|physical exercise]]. The mechanisms by which these changes occur have been strongly debated over more than 100 years between scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waldrop|first=Tony G.|author2=Gary A. Iwamoto|author3=Philippe Haouzi|title=Point:Counterpoint: Supraspinal locomotor centers do/do not contribute significantly to the hyperpnea of dynamic exercise|journal=Journal of Applied Physiology|date=10 November 2005|volume=100|issue=3|pages=1077–1083|doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.01528.2005|url=http://jap.physiology.org/content/100/3/1077.full}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors can be classified in 2 schools:

1. Those who think that the major part of the respiratory changes are pre-programmed in the brain, which would imply that neurons from [[animal locomotion|locomotion]] centers of the brain connect to [[respiratory center]]s in anticipation of movements.

2. Those who think that the major part of the respiratory changes result from the detection of muscle contraction, and that respiration is adapted as a consequence of muscular contraction and oxygen consumption. This would imply that the brain possesses some kind of detection mechanisms that would trigger a respiratory response when muscular contraction occurs.

Many now agree that both mechanisms are probably present and complementary, or working alongside a mechanism that can detect changes in oxygen and/or carbon dioxide blood saturation.

A '''bad quarto''', in Shakespearean scholarship, is a [[book size|quarto-sized]] publication of one of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays that is considered spurious, [[pirated]] from a theatre without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or written down later by an actor or group of actors, which, according to a theory, has been termed "[[memorial reconstruction]]". Since the quarto derives from performance and lacks a direct link to the author's original manuscript, the text would be expected to contain corruptions, abridgements and paraphrasings.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Harold. "Introduction". Shakespeare, William.  ''Hamlet''. Arden Shakespeare (1982) {{ISBN|1-903436-67-2}}. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duthie 1-4"&gt;Duthie, George Ian. "Introduction; the good and bad quartos". ''The Bad Quarto of Hamlet''. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

That is in contrast to a "good quarto", which is considered to be a text that is authorised, one that may have been printed from the author's manuscript, or a scribal copy or prompt copy that is based on the author's manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;Duthie, George Ian. "Introduction; the good and bad quartos". ''The Bad Quarto of Hamlet''. CUP Archive (1941). pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt; "Bad quartos" are considered to include the first quartos of ''Romeo and Juliet'', ''Henry V'', ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'', and ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name="Duthie 1-4"/&gt;

The concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other Elizabethan authors, including Peele's ''[[The Battle of Alcazar (play)|The Battle of Alcazar]]'', [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Greene's]] ''Orlando Furioso'', and the collaborative script, ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Erne, Lukas.

"The Case for the Folio"]. (2007) Playshakespeare.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of bad quarto theory==
The concept of the "bad quarto" as a category of text was created by bibliographer [[Alfred W. Pollard]] in his book ''Shakespeare Folios and Quartos'' (1909).  The idea came to him in his reading of the address by the editors, [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]], which appears at the beginning of Shakespeare's First Folio and is titled, "To the Great Variety of Readers". Heminges and Condell refer to "diuerse stolne, and surreptitious copies" of the plays. It had been thought that that reference was generally to quarto editions of the plays.

Pollard, however, claims that Heminges and Condell meant to refer only to "bad" quartos, and Pollard lists as "bad" the first quartos of ''Romeo and Juliet'' (1597), ''Henry V'' (1600), ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'' (1602), ''Hamlet'' (1603), and ''Pericles'' (1609). Pollard pointed out that not only the texts contained "badness" but also there was badness in those who pirated the plays.&lt;ref&gt;De Grazia, Margreta. "The essential Shakespeare and the material book." Orgel, Stephe and others, editors. ''Shakespeare and the Literary Tradition''. Courier Corporation (1999) {{ISBN|9780815329671}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[W. W. Greg]] worked closely with Pollard and published the bad quarto of ''The Merry Wives of Windsor'',&lt;ref&gt;Greg, W. W. editor. [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001373658 ''Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor''], 1602. Oxford; At the Clarendon Press (1910)&lt;/ref&gt; which is a work that is significant in the history of the "bad quarto" theory. Greg described how the text may have been copied, and he identified the actor who played the role of "Host" as the culprit. Greg called the process that the actor may have used "[[memorial reconstruction]]", a phrase later used by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, Alfred W. ''Shakespeare folios and quartos: a study in the bibliography of Shakespeare's plays'', 1594–1685. University of Michigan Library (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erne, Lukas. ''Shakespeare as Literary Dramatist''. Cambridge University Press (2013) {{ISBN|9781107029651}}. p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bad quarto, good quarto, first folio.png|thumb|320px|Comparison of the "To be, or not to be" soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet]]

For Shakespeare, the [[First Folio]] of 1623 is the crucial document; of the 36 plays contained in that collection, 18 have no other source. The other 18 plays had been printed in [[Quarto (text)|quarto]] form at least once between 1594 and 1623, but since the prefatory matter in the First Folio itself warns against earlier texts, which are termed "stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors", 18th- and 19th-century editors of Shakespeare tended to ignore the quarto texts and preferred the Folio.

It was at first suspected that the bad quarto texts represented [[shorthand]] reporting, a practice mentioned by [[Thomas Heywood]] in the Prologue to his 1605 play ''If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody''; reporters would surreptitiously take down a play's text in shorthand during a performance and pirate a popular play for a competing interest. Greg and R. C. Rhodes argued instead for an alternative theory: since some of the minor speeches varied less than those of major characters, their hypothesis was that the actors who played the minor roles had [[memorial reconstruction|reconstructed the play texts from memory]] and gave an accurate report of the parts that they themselves had memorized and played but a less correct report of the other actors' parts.

The idea caught on among Shakespeare scholars. Peter Alexander added ''The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster'' (1594) and ''The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York'' (1595), the earliest versions of ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' and ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]],'' to the roster of bad quartos; they had been previously thought to be source plays for Shakespeare's later versions of the same stories. The concept of the bad quarto was extended to play texts by authors other than Shakespeare, and by the second half of the 20th century, the idea was widely being used.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of the century, dissenting views had been published, such as the work of Laurie Maguire, then at the [[University of Ottawa]].

==Criticism and alternative hypotheses==
Some problems exist with the bad quarto hypothesis. The first quarto of [[Richard III (play)|''Richard III'']] is considered a bad quarto "even though it is an unusually 'good' bad quarto".&lt;ref&gt;Evans, ''Riverside Shakespeare,'' p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander himself recognised that the idea of memorial reconstruction did not apply perfectly to the two plays that he studied, which possessed problematical features that could not be explained. He maintained that the quartos of the two early histories were "partial" memorial reconstructions.

Some critics, including [[Eric Sams]] and [[Hardin Craig]], dispute the entire concept of memorial reconstruction by pointing out that unlike shorthand reporting, no reliable historical evidence exists that actors reconstructed plays from memory. They believe that memorial reconstruction is a modern fiction. Individual scholars have sometimes preferred alternative explanations for variant texts such as revision. Steven Urkowitz has argued the hypothesis that ''[[King Lear]]'' is a revised work in ''Shakespeare's Revision of "King Lear"''. Some scholars have argued that the more challenging plays of the Shakespearean canon, like ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', make sense as works that Shakespeare wrote at one time and later revised.

Steven Roy Miller considers a revision hypothesis in preference to a bad-quarto hypothesis for ''The Taming of a Shrew'', the alternative version of Shakespeare's ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]].''&lt;ref&gt;Miller, pp. 6–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Burkhart's 1975 study ''Shakespeare's Bad Quartos: Deliberate Abridgements Designed for Performance by a Reduced Cast'' provides another alternative to the hypothesis of bad quartos as memorial reconstruction. Other studies have questioned the "orthodox view" on bad quartos, as in David Farley-Hills's work on ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''.

==Maguire study==
In 1996, Laurie Maguire of the Department of English at the University of Ottawa published a study&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, L. ''Shakespeare's Suspect Texts: the 'Bad' Quartos and their context'' Cambridge Univ Press (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; of the concept of memorial reconstruction, based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the [[BBC TV]] Shakespeare series, broadcast in the early 1980s. She found that actors typically add, drop or invert single words. However, the larger-scale errors that would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance failed to appear in all but a few of the bad quartos. The study, however, uncovered some circumstantial evidence for memorial reconstruction in the bad quartos of ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre|Pericles]]''. According to Maguire, virtually all the bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts that "merit our attention as valid texts in their own right".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 17 March 1996, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Of other playwrights==
Though the bad quarto concept originated in reference to Shakespearean texts, scholars have also applied it to non-Shakespearean play texts of the [[English Renaissance]] era. In 1938, Leo Kirschbaum published "A Census of Bad Quartos" and included 20 play texts.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, pp. 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Maguire's 1996 study examined 41 Shakespearean and non-Shakespearean editions that have been categorised as bad quartos, including the first editions of ''[[Arden of Feversham]]'', ''[[The Merry Devil of Edmonton]]'', and ''[[Fair Em]]'', plays of the [[Shakespeare Apocrypha]], plus [[George Chapman]]'s ''[[The Blind Beggar of Alexandria]]'', [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Doctor Faustus]]'' and ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'', ''Part 1'' of Heywood's ''[[If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody]]'' and [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Maid's Tragedy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, pp. 227–321.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Balsillie School of International Affairs''' ('''BSIA''') is a centre for advanced research and teaching on global governance and international public policy, located in [[Waterloo, Ontario]]. The school is a collaborative partnership between [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], the [[University of Waterloo]], and the [[Centre for International Governance Innovation]]. The BSIA is housed in the north and west wings of the [[CIGI Campus]] building.

== History ==
The BSIA partnership was announced in 2007 when [[Research In Motion]]  co-CEO and CIGI Founder [[Jim Balsillie]] donated $50 million to the initiative. [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] and the [[University of Waterloo]] would also make investments toward the school totalling $50 million ($25 million from each) over the next decade. From 2007-11, classes at the BSIA took place at WLU and UW.

In 2009, plans were announced to house the BSIA within a "CIGI Campus" that would be built alongside the think tank's headquarters in Waterloo. The resulting $68 million complex received federal and provincial funding totalling $50 million through the Knowledge Infrastructure Program and Ontario's 2009 Budget. The City of Waterloo donated the land for the campus through a 99-year lease.

Construction began in 2009 and lasted for approximately two years. In October 2011, the BSIA held its first classes in the CIGI Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.thecord.ca/?p=3618 |title= CIGI opens 114,000 sq. foot campus in Waterloo, featuring Balsillie School|newspaper= [[The Cord Weekly]]|date= 2011-09-21|accessdate= 2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rankings==

Canadian international relations scholars have ranked the Balsillie School the 4th best school in Canada for students seeking a career in public policy, as well as the 4th best school in Canada for students seeking an academic career studying international relations.&lt;ref&gt;http://opencanada.org/features/canadas-ir-scholars-who-they-are-and-where-they-think-you-should-go-to-school/ Retrieved on 2015-03-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who were polled noted both that the Balsillie School has gained prominence rapidly since its founding in 2007, and has attained a reputation for being well-funded.

== Academic Programs ==
The BSIA, with its degree-granting partners WLU and UW, offers three degrees programs:
* The joint university ''PhD in Global Governance'' (offered by WLU and UW) offers specialization in one of six fields: global political economy, global environment, conflict and security, global justice and human rights, multilateral institutions and diplomacy, and global social governance.
* The one year, intensive ''Master's in International Public Policy'' (offered by WLU) provides graduate training for global policy development, implementation and training.
* The ''Master of Arts in Global Governance'' (offered by UW), designed to be completed in 16 months, consists of two terms of course work, a third term in which students complete a major research paper, and an internship in a fourth term.

== Faculty and Personnel ==
The inaugural director of the BSIA was Ramesh Thakur, a former CIGI fellow and vice-rector at the [[United Nations University]]. In 2010, he was succeeded by David A. Welch, CIGI chair of global security and professor of political science at UW. The current director of BSIA is [[John Ravenhill]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.balsillieschool.ca/people/john-ravenhill John Ravenhill | Balsillie School of International Affairs]. Balsillieschool.ca.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65842">{{short description|The reworking of soils and sediments by animals or plants}}
'''Bioturbation''' is defined as the reworking of [[soil]]s and [[sediment]]s by animals or plants. These include burrowing, ingestion and defecation of sediment grains. Bioturbating activities have a profound effect on the environment and &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  are thought to be a primary driver of [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The formal study of bioturbation began in the 1800s by [[Charles Darwin]] experimenting in his garden.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The disruption of aquatic sediments and terrestrial soils through bioturbating activities provides significant [[ecosystem services]]. These include the alteration of [[nutrient]]s in aquatic sediment and overlying water, shelter to other species in the form of burrows in terrestrial and water ecosystems, and soil production on land.&lt;ref name="shaler1891"&gt;Shaler, N. S., 1891, The origin and nature of soils, in Powell, J. W., ed., USGS 12th Annual report 1890-1891: Washington, D.C., Government Printing Office, p. 213-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

Bioturbators are deemed [[ecosystem engineer]]s because they alter resource availability to other species through the physical changes they make to their environments.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; This type of ecosystem change affects the evolution of cohabitating species and the environment,&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt; which is evident in [[trace fossil]]s left in marine and terrestrial sediments. Other bioturbation effects include altering the texture of sediments [[diagenesis|(diagenesis]]), [[bioirrigation]], and displacement of microorganisms and non-living particles. Bioturbation is sometimes confused with the process of bioirrigation, however these processes differ in what they are mixing; bioirrigation refers to the mixing of water and solutes in sediments and is an effect of bioturbation.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Bioturbation's importance for soil processes and [[geomorphology]] was ﬁrst realized by Charles Darwin, who devoted his last scientific book to the subject (''[[The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms]]'').&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Darwin spread chalk dust over a field to observe changes in the depth of the chalk layer over time.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Excavations 30 years after the initial deposit of chalk revealed that the chalk was buried 18 centimeters under the sediment, which indicated a burial rate of 6 millimeters per year.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Darwin attributed this burial to the activity of earthworms in the sediment and determined that these disruptions were important in soil formation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkinson|first=Marshall T.|last2=Richards|first2=Paul J.|last3=Humphreys|first3=Geoff S.|date=2009-12-01|title=Breaking ground: Pedological, geological, and ecological implications of soil bioturbation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825209001470|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=97|issue=1|pages=257–272|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2009.09.005|bibcode=2009ESRv...97..257W}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891, geologist [[Nathaniel Shaler]] expanded Darwin's concept to include soil disruption by ants and trees.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="shaler1891" /&gt; The term "bioturbation" was later coined by Rudolf Richter in 1952 to describe structures in sediment caused by living organisms.&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kristensen|first=E|last2=Penha-Lopes|first2=G|last3=Delefosse|first3=M|last4=Valdemarsen|first4=T|last5=Quintana|first5=CO|last6=Banta|first6=GT|date=2012-02-02|title=What is bioturbation?

== Evolution and Ecology ==

=== Evolution  ===
The onset of bioturbation had a profound effect on the environment and the evolution of other organisms.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meysman|first=F|last2=Meddelburg|first2=J|last3=Heip|first3=C|date=|title=Bioturbation: a fresh look at Darwin's last idea|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534706002436|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=21|issue=12|pages=688–695|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.08.002|via=|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbation is thought to have been an important co-factor of the [[Cambrian explosion|Cambrian Explosion]], during which most major animal [[Phylum|phyla]] appeared in the fossil record over a short time.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; [[Predation]] arose during this time and promoted the development of hard skeletons, for example bristles, spines, and shells, as a form of [[armored]] protection.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It is hypothesized that bioturbation resulted from this skeleton formation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  These new hard parts enabled animals to dig into the sediment to seek shelter from predators, which created an incentive for predators to search for prey in the sediment (see [[Evolutionary arms race|Evolutionary Arms Race]]).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Burrowing species fed on buried organic matter in the sediment which resulted in the evolution of deposit feeding (consumption of organic matter within sediment).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Prior to the development of bioturbation, laminated [[microbial mat]]s were the dominant biological structures of the ocean floor and drove much of the [[Ecosystem|ecosystem functions]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; As bioturbation increased, burrowing animals disturbed the microbial mat system and created a mixed sediment layer with greater biological and chemical diversity.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This greater biological and chemical diversity is thought to have led to the evolution and diversification of seafloor-dwelling species.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

An alternate, less widely accepted hypothesis for the origin of bioturbation exists.

* '''Gallery-diffusers''' create complex tube networks within the upper sediment layers and transport sediment through feeding, burrow construction, and general movement throughout their galleries.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47927758|title=Organism-sediment interactions|last=|first=|date=2001|publisher=Published for the Belle W.

*'''Biodiffusers''' transport sediment particles randomly over short distances as they move through sediments.

* '''Regenerators''' are categorized by their ability to release sediment to the overlying water column, which is then dispersed as they burrow.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; After regenerators abandon their burrows, water flow at the sediment surface can push in and collapse the burrow.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Examples of regenerator species include [[Fiddler crab|fiddler]] and [[Ghost crab|ghost]] crabs.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;

== Biogeochemical Effects of Bioturbation ==
Since its onset around 541 million years ago, bioturbation has been responsible for changes in ocean chemistry, primarily through nutrient cycling.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Canfield|first=Donald E.|last2=Farquhar|first2=James|date=2009-05-19|title=Animal evolution, bioturbation, and the sulfate concentration of the oceans|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8123|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=20|pages=8123–8127|doi=10.1073/pnas.0902037106|issn=0027-8424|pmid=19451639|pmc=2688866|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.8123C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators played, and continue to play, an important role in nutrient transport across sediments.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

For example, bioturbating animals are hypothesized to have affected the cycling of sulfur in the early oceans. According to this hypothesis, bioturbating activities had a large effect on the sulfate concentration in the ocean. Around the Cambrian-Precambrian boundary (541 million years ago), animals begin to mix reduced sulfur from ocean sediments to overlying water causing sulfide to oxidize, which increased the sulfate composition in the ocean. During large extinction events, the sulfate concentration in the ocean was reduced. Although this is difficult to measure directly, seawater sulfur isotope compositions during these times indicates bioturbators influenced the sulfur cycling in the early Earth.

Bioturbators have also altered phosphorus cycling on geologic scales.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dale|first1=A.W|date=2016|title=A model for microbial phosphorus cycling in bioturbated marine sediments: Significance for phosphorus burial in the early Paleozoic|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=189|pages=251–268|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2016.05.046|bibcode=2016GeCoA.189..251D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators mix readily available particulate organic phosphorus (P) deeper into ocean sediment layers which prevents the precipitation of phosphorus [[Mineralization (biology)|(mineralization)]] by increasing the sequestration of phosphorus above normal chemical rates. The sequestration of phosphorus limits oxygen concentrations by decreasing production on a geologic time scale.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt; This decrease in production results in an overall decrease in oxygen levels, and it has been proposed that the rise of bioturbation corresponds to a decrease in oxygen levels of that time.&lt;ref name=":34"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyle|first1=R.A.|date=2014|title=Stabilization of the coupled oxygen and phosphorus cycles by the evolution of bioturbation|volume=7|page=671|doi=10.1038/ngeo2213|journal=Nature Geoscience|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..671B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feedback of animals sequestering phosphorus in the sediments and subsequently reducing oxygen concentrations in the environment limits the intensity of bioturbation in this early environment.&lt;ref name=":34" /&gt;

Nutrient cycling is still affected by bioturbation in the modern Earth. Some examples in the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems are below.

=== Aquatic ===
==== Terrestrial freshwater ecosystems ====
Important sources of bioturbation in freshwater ecosystems include [[Bottom feeder|benthivorous]] (bottom-dwelling) fish, macroinvertebrates such as worms, insect larvae, crustaceans and molluscs, and seasonal influences from [[Fish migration|anadromous]] (migrating) fish such as salmon. Anadromous fish migrate from the sea into fresh-water rivers and streams to spawn. Macroinvertebrates act as biological pumps for moving material between the sediments and water column, feeding on sediment organic matter and transporting mineralized nutrients into the water column.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adámek|first=Zdeněk|last2=Maršálek|first2=Blahoslav|date=2013-02-01|title=Bioturbation of sediments by benthic macroinvertebrates and fish and its implication for pond ecosystems: a review|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10499-012-9527-3|journal=Aquaculture International|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1007/s10499-012-9527-3|issn=0967-6120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both benthivorous and anadromous fish can affect ecosystems by decreasing primary production through sediment re-suspension,&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; the subsequent displacement of benthic primary producers, and recycling nutrients from the sediment back into the water column.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matsuzaki|first=Shin-ichiro S.|last2=Usio|first2=Nisikawa|last3=Takamura|first3=Noriko|last4=Washitani|first4=Izumi|date=2007-01-01|title=Effects of common carp on nutrient dynamics and littoral community composition: roles of excretion and bioturbation|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/schweiz/fal/2007/00000168/00000001/art00004|journal=Fundamental and Applied Limnology / Archiv f??r Hydrobiologie|volume=168|issue=1|pages=27–38|doi=10.1127/1863-9135/2007/0168-0027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holtgrieve|first=Gordon W.|last2=Schindler|first2=Daniel E.|date=2011-02-01|title=Marine-derived nutrients, bioturbation, and ecosystem metabolism: reconsidering the role of salmon in streams|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/09-1694.1/abstract|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=92|issue=2|pages=373–385|doi=10.1890/09-1694.1|issn=1939-9170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lakes and ponds ====
[[File:Chironomidae.jpg|thumb|Chironomid larvae.]]
The sediments of lake and pond ecosystems are rich in organic matter, with higher organic matter and nutrient contents in the sediments than in the overlying water.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Nutrient re-regeneration through sediment bioturbation moves nutrients into the water column, thereby enhancing the growth of aquatic plants and phytoplankton ([[primary producers]]).&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The major nutrients of interest in this flux are nitrogen and phosphorus, which often limit the levels of primary production in an ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Bioturbation increases the flux of mineralized (inorganic) forms of these elements, which can be directly used by primary producers. In addition, bioturbation increases the water column concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus-containing organic matter, which can then be consumed by fauna and mineralized.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Lake and pond sediments often transition from the aerobic (oxygen containing) character of the overlaying water to the anaerobic (without oxygen) conditions of the lower sediment over sediment depths of only a few millimeters, therefore, even bioturbators of modest size can affect this transition of the chemical characteristics of sediments.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; By mixing anaerobic sediments into the water column, bioturbators allow aerobic processes to interact with the re-suspended sediments and the newly exposed bottom sediment surfaces.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

Macroinvertebrates including [[Chironomidae|chironomid]] (non-biting midges) larvae and [[Tubifex tubifex|tubificed worms]] (detritus worms) are important agents of bioturbation in these ecosystems and have different effects based on their respective feeding habits. Tubificed worms do not form burrows, they are upward conveyors. Chironomids, on the other hand, form burrows in the sediment, acting as bioirrigators and aerating the sediments and are downward conveyors. This activity, combined with chironomid's respiration within their burrows, decrease available oxygen in the sediment and increase the loss of nitrates through enhanced rates of [[denitrification]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The increased oxygen input to sediments by macroinvertebrate bioirrigation coupled with bioturbation at the sediment-water interface complicates the total flux of phosphorus . While bioturbation results in a net flux of phosphorus into the water column, the bio-irrigation of the sediments with oxygenated water enhances the adsorption of phosphorus onto iron-oxide compounds, thereby reducing the total flux of phosphorus into the water column.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

The presence of macroinvertebrates in sediment can initiate bioturbation due to their status as an important food source for benthivorous fish such as [[Common carp|carp]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Of the bioturbating, benthivorous fish species, carp in particular are important ecosystem engineers and their foraging and burrowing activities can alter the water quality characteristics of ponds and lakes.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt; Carp increase water [[turbidity]] by the re-suspension of benthic sediments. This increased turbidity limits light penetration and coupled with increased nutrient flux from the sediment into the water column, inhibits the growth of macrophytes (aquatic plants) favoring the growth of phytoplankton in the surface waters. Surface phytoplankton colonies benefit from both increased suspended nutrients and from recruitment of buried phytoplankton cells released from the sediments by the fish bioturbation.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Macrophyte growth has also been shown to be inhibited by displacement from the bottom sediments due to fish burrowing.&lt;ref name=":33" /&gt;

==== Rivers and streams ====
River and stream ecosystems show similar responses to bioturbation activities, with chironomid larvae and tubificid worm macroinvertebrates remaining as important benthic agents of bioturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mermillod-Blondin|first=Florian|last2=Gaudet|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Gerino|first3=Magali|last4=Desrosiers|first4=Gaston|last5=Jose|first5=Jacques|last6=Châtelliers|first6=Michel Creuzé des|date=2004-07-01|title=Relative influence of bioturbation and predation on organic matter processing in river sediments: a microcosm experiment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01233.x/abstract|journal=Freshwater Biology|language=en|volume=49|issue=7|pages=895–912|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2427.2004.01233.x|issn=1365-2427}}&lt;/ref&gt; These environments are can also be subject to strong season bioturbation effects from anadromous fish.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Salmon function as bioturbators on both gravel to sand-sized sediment and a nutrient scale, by moving and re-working sediments in the construction of redds (gravel depressions or "nests" containing eggs buried under a thin layer of sediment) in rivers and streams&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gottesfeld|first=AS|last2=Hassan|first2=MA|last3=Tunnicliffe|first3=JF|date=2008|title=Salmon bioturbation and stream process|url=|journal=American Fisheries Society Symposium|volume=65|pages=|via=researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by mobilization of nutrients.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buxton|first=Todd H.|last2=Buffington|first2=John M.|last3=Tonina|first3=Daniele|last4=Fremier|first4=Alexander K.|last5=Yager|first5=Elowyn M.|date=2015-04-13|title=Modeling the influence of salmon spawning on hyporheic exchange of marine-derived nutrients in gravel stream beds|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/10.1139/cjfas-2014-0413|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=72|issue=8|pages=1146–1158|doi=10.1139/cjfas-2014-0413|issn=0706-652X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of salmon redds functions to increase the ease of fluid movement ([[hydraulic conductivity]]) and porosity of the stream bed.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In select rivers, if salmon congregate in large enough concentrations in a given area of the river, the total sediment transport from redd construction can equal or exceed the sediment transport from flood events.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The net effect on sediment movement is the downstream transfer of gravel, sand and finer materials and enhancement of water mixing within the river substrate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The construction of salmon redds increases sediment and nutrient fluxes through the [[hyporheic zone]] (area between surface water and groundwater) of rivers and effects the dispersion and retention of marine derived nutrients (MDN) within the river ecosystem.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; MDN are delivered to river and stream ecosystems by the fecal matter of spawning salmon and the decaying carcasses of salmon that have completed spawning and died.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Numerical modeling suggests that residence time of MDN within a salmon spawning reach is inversely proportional to the amount of redd construction within the river.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Measurements of respiration within a salmon-bearing river in Alaska further suggest that salmon bioturbation of the river bed plays a significant role in mobilizing MDN and limiting primary productivity while salmon spawning is active.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The river ecosystem was found to switch from a net [[autotroph]]ic to [[heterotroph]]ic system in response to decreased primary production and increased respiration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The decreased primary production in this study was attributed to the loss of benthic primary producers who were dislodged due to bioturbation, while increased respiration was thought to be due to increased respiration of organic carbon, also attributed to sediment mobilization from salmon redd construction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; While marine derived nutrients are generally thought to increase productivity in riparian and freshwater ecosystems, several studies have suggested that temporal effects of bioturbation should be considered when characterizing salmon influences on nutrient cycles.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==== Marine environments ====
Major marine bioturbators range from small [[Sediment-dwelling organism|infaunal]] invertebrates to fish and marine mammals.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In most marine sediments, however, they are dominated by small invertebrates, including polychaetes, bivalves, burrowing shrimp, and amphipods.

===== Shallow and Coastal =====
Coastal ecosystems, such as estuaries, are generally highly productive, which results in the accumulation of large quantities of [[detritus]] (organic waste). These large quantities, in addition to typically small sediment grain size and dense populations, make bioturbators important in estuarine respiration.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":35"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/798834896|title=Interactions between macro- and microorganisms in marine sediments|date=2005|publisher=American Geophysical Union|others=American Geophysical Union.|isbn=9781118665442|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=798834896}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbators enhance the transport of oxygen into sediments through irrigation and increase the surface area of oxygenated sediments through burrow construction.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Bioturbators also transport organic matter deeper into sediments through general reworking activities and production of fecal matter.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; This ability to replenish oxygen and other solutes at sediment depth allows for enhanced respiration by both bioturbators as well as the microbial community, thus altering estuarine elemental cycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nitrogen Cycling in Coastal Marine Environments|last=Aller|first=Robert C.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|year=1988|isbn=|editor-last=Blackburn|editor-first=T.H.|location=|pages=301–338|chapter=13.

=== Terrestrial ===
[[File:Camas pocket gopher mounds.JPG|thumb|Pocket gopher mounds |256x256px]]
Plants and animals utilize soil for food and shelter, disturbing the upper soil layers and transporting chemically weathered rock called [[saprolite]] from the lower soil depths to the surface.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Terrestrial bioturbation is important in soil production, burial, organic matter content, and downslope transport. Tree roots are sources of [[soil organic matter]], with root growth and stump decay also contributing to soil transport and mixing.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Death and decay of tree roots first delivers organic matter to the soil and then creates voids, decreasing soil density. Tree uprooting causes considerable soil displacement by producing mounds, mixing the soil, or inverting [[Soil profile|vertical sections of soil.]]&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

Burrowing animals, such as earth worms and small mammals form passageways for air and water transport which changes the soil properties, such as the vertical particle-size distribution, soil [[porosity]], and nutrient content.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Invertebrates that burrow and consume plant detritus help produce an organic-rich topsoil known as the [[soil biomantle]], and thus contribute to the formation of [[Soil horizon|soil horizons.]]&lt;ref name="shaler1891" /&gt; Small mammals such as [[pocket gophers]] also play an important role in the production of soil, possibly with an equal magnitude to abiotic processes.&lt;ref name=":38"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reichman|first=O.J.|last2=Seabloom|first2=Eric W.|title=The role of pocket gophers as subterranean ecosystem engineers|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534701023291|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=17|issue=1|pages=44–49|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02329-1|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pocket gophers form above-ground mounds, which moves soil from the lower soil horizons to the surface, exposing minimally weathered rock to surface erosion processes, speeding soil formation.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Pocket gophers are thought to play an important role in the downslope transport of soil, as the soil that forms their mounds is more susceptible to erosion and subsequent transport. Similar to tree root effects, the construction of burrows-even when backfilled- decreases soil density.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; The formation of surface mounds also buries surface vegetation, creating nutrient hotspots when the vegetation decomposes, increasing soil organic matter. Due to the high metabolic demands of their burrow-excavating subterranean lifestyle, pocket gophers must consume large amounts of plant material.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt; Though this has a detrimental effect on individual plants, the net effect of pocket gophers is increased plant growth from their positive effects on soil nutrient content and physical soil properties.&lt;ref name=":38" /&gt;

== In the fossil record ==
[[File:Planolites.jpg|thumb|Planolite fossil]]

=== In the sediment record ===
Patterns or traces of bioturbation are preserved in [[Lithification|lithified]] rock. The study of such patterns is called [[ichnology]], or the study of "trace fossils", which, in the case of bioturbators, are fossils left behind by digging or burrowing animals. This can be compared to the footprint left behind by these animals. In some cases bioturbation is so pervasive that it completely obliterates [[sedimentary structures]], such as laminated layers or [[cross-bedding]]. Thus, it affects the disciplines of [[sedimentology]] and [[stratigraphy]] within geology. The study of bioturbator ichnofabrics uses the depth of the fossils, the cross-cutting of fossils, and the sharpness (or how well defined) of the fossil&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=A. M.|last2=Goldring|first2=R.|date=|title=Description and analysis of bioturbation and ichnofabric|url=https://doi.org/10.1144/gsjgs.150.1.0141|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|volume=150|issue=1|pages=141–148|doi=10.1144/gsjgs.150.1.0141|via=|year=1993|bibcode=1993JGSoc.150..141T}}&lt;/ref&gt; to assess the activity that occurred in old sediments. Typically the deeper the fossil, the better preserved and well defined the specimen.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Important [[trace fossil]]s from bioturbation have been found in marine sediments from tidal, coastal and deep sea sediments. In addition sand dune, or [[Eolian dust|Eolian]], sediments are important for preserving a wide variety of fossils.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt; Evidence of bioturbation has been found in deep-sea sediment cores including into long records, although the act extracting the core can disturb the signs of bioturbation, especially at shallower depths.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hertweck|first1=G|last2=Liebezeit|first2=G|title=Bioturbation structures of polychaetes in modern shallow marine environments and their analogues to Chondrites group traces|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|date=2007|volume=245|issue=3|pages=382–389|doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2006.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arthropods, in particular are important to the geologic record of bioturbation of Eolian sediments.

== Mathematical Models ==
The role of bioturbators in sediment biogeochemistry makes bioturbation a common parameter in sediment biogeochemical models, which are often [[Numerical modeling (geology)|numerical models]] built using [[Ordinary differential equation|ordinary]] and [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref name=":41"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/851842693|title=Diagenetic Models and Their Implementation : Modelling Transport and Reactions in Aquatic Sediments|last=P.|first=Boudreau, Bernard|date=1997|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=364264399X|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=851842693}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioturbation is typically represented as D&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, or the biodiffusion coefficient, and is described by a [[Diffusion equation|diffusion]] and, sometimes, an [[Advective derivative|advective]] term.&lt;ref name=":41" /&gt; This representation and subsequent variations account for the different modes of mixing by functional groups and bioirrigation that results from them.

Parameterization of bioturbation, however, can vary, as newer and more complex models can be used to fit tracer profiles. Unlike the standard biodiffusion model, these more complex models, such as expanded versions of the biodiffusion model, random walk, and particle-tracking models, can provide more accuracy, incorporate different modes of sediment transport, and account for more spatial heterogeneity.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aquino|first=Tomás|last2=Roche|first2=Kevin R.|last3=Aubeneau|first3=Antoine|last4=Packman|first4=Aaron I.|last5=Bolster|first5=Diogo|date=2017|title=A Process-Based Model for Bioturbation-Induced Mixing|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14705-1|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-14705-1|issn=2045-2322|via=|bibcode=2017NatSR...714287A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wheatcroft|first=R.

The Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany was established in the year 1946, under the name, Institute of [[Palaeobotany]], a progression of the Palaeobotanical society formed by a group of botanists led by the renowned [[India]]n botanist, [[Birbal Sahni|Professor Birbal Sahni]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/BSahni.htm Birbal Sahni&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101124440/http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/BSahni.htm |date=1 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the father of [[Dendrology]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBkr_9aktUo Birbal Sahni, father of the Dendrology - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://archive.is/20140626055259/http://www.sritweets.com/birbal-sahni-father-dendrology-birbal-sahni-extensive-research-paleobotany/ Birbal Sahni, father of the Dendrology| Birbal Sahni did extensive research in Paleobotany&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; who became its first Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-religion.net/ India Religion Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The initial office of the Institute was at the Department of [[Botany]], [[Lucknow University]]. The then government of the United Provinces gifted a bungalow sitting on 3.50 acres of land to the Institute in 1948, which till today remains its campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minglebox.com/college/Birbal-Sahni-Institute-of-Palaeobotany-BSIP-Lucknow Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, Lucknow - Admission, Courses, Fee, Contact Address | BSIP | Lucknow | Uttar Pradesh - Minglebox&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Savitri Sahni, took over the reins of the Institute on her husband's death in 1949 and the Institute moved into a new purpose-built building in 1953. The Institute, by that time, had already started to be known and, in 1951, [[UNESCO]] included it in their Technical Assistance Program. On 9 July 1969, the research activities were alienated from the society and Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany was formed, in honor of the scientist,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; as an independent autonomous research organization funded by the Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundoodata.com/companies-detail/Birbal-Sahni-Institute-of-Palaeobotany-(BSIP)/61661.html Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany (BSIP) - Lucknow - Address Phone no Website Email Turnover - MD CEO HR CFO CIO&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Literature}}

A '''book'''  is both a usually portable physical object and the body of immaterial representations or intellectual object whose material signs—written or drawn lines or other two-dimensional media—the physical object contains or houses. 

As a physical object, a book is a stack of usually rectangular [[page (paper)|pages]] (made of [[papyrus]], [[parchment]], [[vellum]], or [[paper]]) oriented with one side (either left or right, depending on the direction in which one reads a script) tied, sewn, or otherwise fixed together and then [[bookbinding|bound]] to the flexible spine of a protective [[book cover|cover]] of heavier, relatively inflexible material so that, when the opened front cover has received a massy enough stack of sheets, the book can lie flat.&lt;ref&gt;IEILS, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;  The technical term for this physical arrangement is [[Codex|''codex'']] (in the plural, ''codices''). In the history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or records, the codex replaces its immediate predecessor, the [[scroll]].  

As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still considerable, though not so extensive, investment of time to read. This sense of book has a restricted and an unrestricted sense. In the restricted sense, a book is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage that reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several scrolls, and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. So, for instance, each part of [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' is called a book, as of course the Bible encompasses many different books.  In the unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections, whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.

But the intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, or can be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings, or photographs, or such things as crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls.  In a physical book the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines as support for on-going entries, i.e., an account book, an appointment book, a log book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or day book, or a sketch book.  Some physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album.  

Books may be distributed in electronic form as [[e-book]]s and other formats. In its "Revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Statistics on the Production and Distribution of Books, Newspapers and Periodicals" of 1 November 1985, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) stated that it was "convinced that it is desirable that the national authorities responsible for collecting and reporting statistics relating to the production and distribution of printed publications should be guided by certain standards in the matter of definitions, classification and presentation," and so "in order to improve the international comparability of statistics," it defined a book as "a non-periodic publication of at least 49 pages exclusive of the cover pages, published in the country and made available to the public" (11(a)), so that books statistics could be collected on "(a) Government publications, i.e., publications issued by public administrations or their subsidiary bodies, except for those which are confidential or designed for internal distribution only; (b) School textbooks, books prescribed for pupils receiving education at the first and second level as defined in the revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Educational Statistics adopted by the General Conference; (c) University theses; (d) Offprints, i.e., reprints of a part of a book or a periodical already published, provided that they have a title and a separate pagination and that they constitute a distinct work; (e) Publications which form part of a series, but which constitute separate bibliographical units; (f) Illustrated works: (i) Collections of prints, reproductions of works of art, drawings, etc., when such collections form complete, paginated volumes and when the illustrations are accompanied by an explanatory text, however short, referring to these works or to the artists themselves; (ii) Albums, illustrated books and pamphlets written in the form of continuous narratives, with pictures illustrating certain episodes; (iii) Albums and picture-books for children; (iv) Comic books" (9-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13146&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Revised Recommendation concerning the International Standardization of Statistics on the Production and Distribution of Books, Newspapers and Periodicals: UNESCO|website=portal.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A single sheet in a codex  is a [[Recto|leaf]], and each side of a leaf is a [[page (paper)|page]].

Although in ordinary academic parlance a [[monograph]] is understood to be a specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a single scholarly subject, in [[library and information science]] ''monograph'' denotes more broadly any non-serial publication complete in one [[Volume (bibliography)|volume]] (book) or a finite number of volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume [[In Search of Lost Time|''In Search of Lost Time'']]), in contrast to serial publications like a [[magazine]], [[academic journal|journal]], or [[newspaper]]. An avid reader or collector of books or a book lover is a [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]] or colloquially, "bookworm". A shop where [[Bookselling|books are bought and sold]] is a [[bookshop]] or bookstore. Books are also sold elsewhere. Books can also be borrowed from [[Lending library|libraries]]. [[Google]] has estimated that as of 2010, approximately 130,000,000 distinct titles had been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2010/08/books-of-world-stand-up-and-be-counted.html |date=August 5, 2010 |title=Books of the world, stand up and be counted!

At least until Sunday. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has decreased because of the use of [[Ebooks|e-books]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Curtis|first1=George|title=The Law of Cybercrimes and Their Investigations|date=2011|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; though sales of e-books declined in the first half of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/business/media/the-plot-twist-e-book-sales-slip-and-print-is-far-from-dead.html |date=September 22, 2015 |title=The Plot Twist: E-Book Sales Slip, and Print Is Far From Dead |accessdate=October 8, 2015 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word book comes from [[Old English]] "bōc", which in turn comes from the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] root "*bōk-", [[cognate]] to "[[beech]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/book |title=Book |publisher=Dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- see American Heritage Dictionary and Online Etymology Dictionary --&gt; Similarly, in [[Slavic languages]] (for example, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]) "буква" (bukva—"letter") is cognate with "beech". In Russian and in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and Macedonian, the word "букварь" (bukvar') or "буквар" (bukvar) refers specifically to a primary school textbook that helps young children master the techniques of reading and writing.
It is thus conjectured that the earliest [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] writings may have been carved on beech wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northvegr.org/holy/b.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103044850/http://www.northvegr.org/holy/b.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=November 3, 2008|title=Northvegr - Holy Language Lexicon|date=November 3, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Latin word ''codex'', meaning a book in the modern sense (bound and with separate leaves), originally meant "block of wood".

=== Antiquity ===

When [[History of writing|writing systems]] were created in [[ancient civilization]]s, a variety of objects, such as stone, [[clay tablet|clay]], tree bark, metal sheets, and bones, were used for writing; these are studied in [[epigraphy]].

==== Tablet ====
{{Main|Clay tablet|Wax tablet}}{{See also|Stylus}}

A tablet is a physically robust writing medium, suitable for casual transport and writing. [[Clay tablet]]s were flattened and mostly dry pieces of clay that could be easily carried, and impressed with a [[stylus]]. They were used as a writing medium, especially for writing in [[cuneiform]], throughout the [[Bronze Age]] and well into the [[Iron Age]]. [[Wax tablet]]s were pieces of wood covered in a thick enough coating of wax to record the impressions of a stylus. They were the normal writing material in schools, in accounting, and for taking notes. They had the advantage of being reusable: the wax could be melted, and reformed into a blank.

The custom of binding several wax tablets together (Roman ''pugillares'') is a possible precursor of modern bound (codex) books.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology of the word ''codex'' (block of wood) also suggests that it may have developed from wooden wax tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bischoff| first = Bernhard| others = Dáibhí ó Cróinin| title = Latin palaeography antiquity and the Middle Ages| url = https://books.google.com/?id=CFZgQgAACAAJ| year = 1990| publisher = Cambridge University Press| location = Cambridge| isbn = 978-0-521-36473-7| page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scroll ====
{{main article|Scroll}}
[[File:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|left|Egyptian papyrus showing the god [[Osiris]] and the weighing of the heart.]]
Scrolls can be made from [[papyrus]], a thick [[paper|paper-like]] material made by weaving the stems of the papyrus plant, then pounding the woven sheet with a hammer-like tool until it is flattened. Papyrus was used for writing in [[Ancient Egypt]], perhaps as early as the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], although the first evidence is from the account books of King [[Nefertiti Kakai]] of the [[Fifth Dynasty]] (about 2400 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papyrus sheets were glued together to form a [[scroll (parchment)|scroll]]. Tree bark such as [[Tilia|lime]] and other materials were also used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dard Hunter]]. ''Papermaking: History and Technique of an Ancient Craft New ed.'' Dover Publications 1978, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herodotus]] (History 5:58), the [[Phoenicians]] brought writing and papyrus to Greece around the 10th or 9th century BC. The Greek word for papyrus as writing material (''biblion'') and book (''biblos'') come from the Phoenician port town [[Byblos]], through which papyrus was exported to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin. ''Scribes, Script and Books'', pp. 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt; From Greek we also derive the word tome ({{lang-el|τόμος}}), which originally meant a slice or piece and from there began to denote "a roll of papyrus". ''Tomus'' was used by the Latins with exactly the same meaning as ''volumen'' (see also below the explanation by Isidore of Seville).

Whether made from papyrus, [[parchment]], or paper, scrolls were the dominant form of book in the Hellenistic, Roman, Chinese, Hebrew, and Macedonian cultures. The more modern [[codex]] book format form took over the Roman world by [[late antiquity]], but the scroll format persisted much longer in Asia.

==== Codex ====
[[File:Bamboo book - binding - UCR.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Chinese [[bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo book]] meets the modern definition of Codex]]
{{main article|Codex}}
[[Isidore of Seville]] (d. 636) explained the then-current relation between codex, book and scroll in his Etymologiae (VI.13): "A codex is composed of many books; a book is of one scroll. It is called codex by way of metaphor from the trunks (''codex'') of trees or vines, as if it were a wooden stock, because it contains in itself a multitude of books, as it were of branches." Modern usage differs.

A codex (in modern usage) is the first information repository that modern people would recognize as a "book": leaves of uniform size [[bookbinding|bound]] in some manner along one edge, and typically held between two [[book cover|covers]] made of some more robust material. The first written mention of the codex as a form of book is from [[Martial]], in his Apophoreta &lt;small&gt;CLXXXIV&lt;/small&gt; at the end of the first century, where he praises its compactness. However, the codex never gained much popularity in the pagan Hellenistic world, and only within the Christian community did it gain widespread use.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Early Christian Literature. Edd. Frances Young, Lewis Ayres, Andrew Louth, Ron White. Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; This change happened gradually during the 3rd and 4th centuries, and the reasons for adopting the codex form of the book are several: the format is more economical, as both sides of the writing material can be used; and it is portable, searchable, and easy to conceal. A book is much easier to read, to find a page that you want, and to flip through. A scroll is more awkward to use. The Christian [[author]]s may also have wanted to distinguish their writings from the pagan and Judaic texts written on scrolls. In addition, some metal books were made, that required smaller pages of metal, instead of an impossibly long, unbending scroll of metal. A book can also be easily stored in more compact places, or side by side in a tight library or shelf space.

==== Manuscripts ====
{{main article|Manuscript}}
[[File:RomanVirgilFolio014rVergilPortrait.jpg|thumb|left|Folio 14 recto of the 5th century [[Vergilius Romanus]] contains an author portrait of [[Virgil]]. Note the [[bookcase]] (''capsa''), reading stand and the text written without word spacing in [[rustic capitals]].]]

The fall of the [[Roman Empire]] in the 5th century AD saw the decline of the [[culture of ancient Rome]]. Papyrus became difficult to obtain due to lack of contact with Egypt, and parchment, which had been used for centuries, became the main writing material. Parchment is a material made from processed animal skin and used—mainly in the past—for writing on.
Parchment is most commonly made of calfskin, sheepskin, or goatskin. It was historically used for writing documents, notes, or the pages of a book. Parchment is limed, scraped and dried under tension. It is not tanned, and is thus different from leather. This makes it more suitable for writing on, but leaves it very reactive to changes in relative humidity and makes it revert to rawhide if overly wet.

Monasteries carried on the [[Latin literature|Latin]] writing tradition in the [[Western Roman Empire]]. [[Cassiodorus]], in the monastery of Vivarium (established around 540), stressed the importance of copying texts.&lt;ref&gt;Leila Avrin.

''Saint Benedict and His Monks''. Staples Press Ltd 1956, pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rule of Saint Benedict'' (Ch. &lt;small&gt;XLVIII&lt;/small&gt;), which set aside certain times for reading, greatly influenced the monastic culture of the [[Middle Ages]] and is one of the reasons why the clergy were the predominant readers of books. The tradition and style of the Roman Empire still dominated, but slowly the peculiar medieval book culture emerged.

[[File:CodxAmiatinusFolio5rEzra.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Codex Amiatinus]] anachronistically depicts the Biblical [[Ezra]] with the kind of books used in the 8th Century AD.]]
Before the invention and adoption of the [[printing press]], almost all books were copied by hand, which made books expensive and comparatively rare. Smaller monasteries usually had only a few dozen books, medium-sized perhaps a few hundred. By the 9th century, larger collections held around 500 volumes and even at the end of the Middle Ages, the papal library in [[Avignon]] and Paris library of the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] held only around 2,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Martin D. Joachim. Historical Aspects of Cataloguing and Classification. Haworth Press 2003, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[scriptorium]]'' of the monastery was usually located over the [[chapter house]]. Artificial light was forbidden for fear it may damage the manuscripts. There were five types of scribes:
* '''Calligraphers''', who dealt in fine book production
* '''Copyists''', who dealt with basic production and correspondence
* '''Correctors''', who collated and compared a finished book with the manuscript from which it had been produced
* '''Illuminators''', who painted illustrations
* '''Rubricators''', who painted in the red letters

[[File:Escribano.jpg|thumb|left|Burgundian author and scribe [[Jean Miélot]], from his ''Miracles de Notre Dame'', 15th century.]]
The bookmaking process was long and laborious. The parchment had to be prepared, then the unbound pages were planned and ruled with a blunt tool or lead, after which the text was written by the [[scribe]], who usually left blank areas for illustration and [[rubrication]]. Finally, the book was bound by the [[bookbinding|bookbinder]].&lt;ref&gt;Edith Diehl. ''Bookbinding: Its Background and Technique''. Dover Publications 1980, pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Milkau Bücherschrank mit angekettetem Buch aus der Bibliothek von Cesena 109-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Desk with chained books in the [[Malatestiana Library]] of [[Cesena]], [[Italy]].]]

Different types of ink were known in antiquity, usually prepared from soot and gum, and later also from [[gall]] nuts and [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron vitriol]]. This gave writing a brownish black color, but black or brown were not the only colors used. There are texts written in red or even gold, and different colors were used for illumination. For very luxurious manuscripts the whole parchment [[Purple parchment|was colored purple]], and the text was written on it with gold or silver (for example, [[Codex Argenteus]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography'', pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish monks introduced spacing between words in the 7th century. This facilitated reading, as these monks tended to be less familiar with Latin. However, the use of spaces between words did not become commonplace before the 12th century. It has been argued that the use of spacing between words shows the transition from semi-vocalized reading into silent reading.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Saenger. ''Space Between Words: The Origins of Silent Reading''. Stanford University Press 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first books used [[parchment]] or [[vellum]] ([[calfskin]]) for the pages. The book covers were made of wood and covered with leather. Because dried parchment tends to assume the form it had before processing, the books were fitted with clasps or straps. During the later [[Middle Ages]], when public libraries appeared, up to the 18th century, books were often chained to a bookshelf or a [[desk]] to prevent theft. These chained books are called ''libri catenati''.

At first, books were copied mostly in monasteries, one at a time. With the rise of universities in the 13th century, the [[Manuscript culture]] of the time led to an increase in the demand for books, and a new system for copying books appeared. The books were divided into unbound leaves (''pecia''), which were lent out to different copyists, so the speed of book production was considerably increased. The system was maintained by secular [[stationery|stationers]] guilds, which produced both religious and non-religious material.&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Bischoff. ''Latin Palaeography'', pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Judaism]] has kept the art of the scribe alive up to the present. According to Jewish tradition, the [[Torah]] scroll placed in a [[synagogue]] must be written by hand on parchment and a printed book would not do, though the congregation may use printed prayer books and printed copies of the Scriptures are used for study outside the [[synagogue]]. A [[sofer]] "scribe" is a highly respected member of any observant Jewish community.

==== Middle East ====
{{Cite check|section|date=September 2010}}
People of various religious (Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians, Muslims) and ethnic backgrounds (Syriac, Coptic, Persian, Arab etc.) in the Middle East also produced and bound books in the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (mid 8th century to 1258), developing advanced techniques in [[Islamic calligraphy]], [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] and bookbinding. A number of cities in the medieval Islamic world had book production centers and book markets. Yaqubi (d. 897) says that in his time Baghdad had over a hundred booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;W. Durant, "The Age of Faith", New York 1950, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Book shops were often situated around the town's principal mosque &lt;ref&gt;S.E. Al-Djazairi "The Golden Age of Islamic Civilization", Manchester 2996, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; as in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]], that has a street named ''Kutubiyyin'' or book sellers in English and the famous [[Koutoubia Mosque]] is named so because of its location in this street.

The medieval [[Muslim world]] also used a method of reproducing reliable copies of a book in large quantities known as [[Proofreading|check reading]], in contrast to the traditional method of a single scribe producing only a single copy of a single manuscript. In the check reading method, only "authors could authorize copies, and this was done in public sessions in which the copyist read the copy aloud in the presence of the author, who then certified it as accurate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–86 [43]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this check-reading system, "an author might produce a dozen or more copies from a single reading," and with two or more readings, "more than one hundred copies of a single book could easily be produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Edmund Burke|title=Islam at the Center: Technological Complexes and the Roots of Modernity|journal=[[Journal of World History]]|volume=20|issue=2|date=June 2009|doi=10.1353/jwh.0.0045|pages=165–86 [44]|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using as writing material the relatively cheap paper instead of parchment or papyrus the Muslims, in the words of Pedersen "accomplished a feat of crucial significance not only to the history of the Islamic book, but also to the whole world of books".&lt;ref&gt;Johs. Pedersen, "The Arabic Book", Princeton University Press, 1984, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wood block printing ====

[[File:Traditional_Bagh_hand_block_print_master_craftsman-artisan-artist_Mohammed_Bilal_Khatri,_Madhya_Pradesh,_India.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bagh Print]] Traditional woodblock printing in [[Bagh, Dhar|Bagh]] [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]].]]
In [[woodblock printing]], a relief image of an entire page was carved into blocks of wood, inked, and used to print copies of that page. This method originated in China, in the [[Han dynasty]] (before 220 AD), as a method of [[printing]] on [[textiles]] and later [[paper]], and was widely used throughout [[East Asia]]. The oldest dated book printed by this method is ''[[The Diamond Sutra]]'' (868 AD).The method (called ''[[Woodcut]]'' when used in art) arrived in Europe in the early 14th century. Books (known as [[Woodblock printing|block-books]]), as well as [[playing-cards]] and [[old master print|religious pictures]], began to be produced by this method. Creating an entire book was a painstaking process, requiring a hand-carved block for each page; and the wood blocks tended to crack, if stored for long. The monks or people who wrote them were paid highly.

==== Movable type and incunabula ====
[[File:Bucheinband.15.Jh.r.Inkunabel.jpg|thumb|upright|A 15th-century [[Incunable]]. Notice the blind-tooled cover, corner bosses and clasps.]]
{{main article|Movable type|Incunable}}
[[File:SelectedTeachingsofBuddhistSagesandSonMasters1377.jpg|thumb|left|''Selected Teachings of Buddhist Sages and Son Masters'', the earliest known book printed with movable metal type, 1377. [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].]]

The Chinese inventor [[Bi Sheng]] made [[movable type]] of earthenware c. 1045, but there are no known surviving examples of his printing. Around 1450, in what is commonly regarded as an independent invention, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented movable type in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]]. This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce, and more widely available.

Early printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as [[incunable]]s or ''incunabula''. "A man born in 1453, the year of the fall of Constantinople, could look back from his fiftieth year on a lifetime in which about eight million books had been printed, more perhaps than all the scribes of Europe had produced since Constantine founded his city in AD 330."&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Clapham (industrialist)|Clapham, Michael]], "Printing" in ''A History of Technology'', Vol 2. ''From the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution'', edd. Charles Singer ''et al.'' (Oxford 1957), p. 377. Cited from [[Elizabeth L. Eisenstein]], ''The Printing Press as an Agent of Change'' (Cambridge University, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century to 21st centuries===
Steam-powered printing presses became popular in the early 19th century. These machines could print 1,100 sheets per hour, but workers could only set 2,000 letters per hour.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Monotype]] and [[linotype machine|linotype]] typesetting machines were introduced in the late 19th century. They could set more than 6,000 letters per hour and an entire line of type at once. There have been numerous improvements in the printing press. As well, the conditions for [[freedom of the press]] have been improved through the gradual relaxation of restrictive censorship laws. See also [[intellectual property]], [[public domain]], [[copyright]]. In mid-20th century, European book production had risen to over 200,000 titles per year.

Throughout the 20th century, libraries have faced an ever-increasing rate of publishing, sometimes called an [[information explosion]]. The advent of [[electronic publishing]] and the [[internet]] means that much new information is not printed in paper books, but is made available online through a [[digital library]], on [[CD-ROM]], in the form of e-books or other online media. An [[on-line book]] is an e-book that is available online through the internet. Though many books are produced digitally, most digital versions are not available to the public, and there is no decline in the rate of paper publishing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowker.com/index.php/press-releases/616-bowker-reports-traditional-us-book-production-flat-in-2009 Bowker Reports Traditional U.S. Book Production Flat in 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128205430/http://www.bowker.com/index.php/press-releases/616-bowker-reports-traditional-us-book-production-flat-in-2009 |date=January 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an effort, however, to convert books that are in the [[public domain]] into a digital medium for unlimited redistribution and infinite availability. This effort is spearheaded by [[Project Gutenberg]] combined with [[Distributed Proofreaders]]. There have also been new developments in the process of publishing books. Technologies such as POD or "[[print on demand]]", which make it possible to print as few as one book at a time, have made self-publishing (and [[vanity publishing]]) much easier and more affordable. On-demand publishing has allowed publishers, by avoiding the high costs of warehousing, to keep low-selling books in print rather than declaring them out of print.

[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (2).jpg|thumb|The [[Bookbinding|spine]] of the book is an important aspect in [[book design]], especially in the cover design. When the books are stacked up or stored in a shelf, the details on the spine is the only visible surface that contains the information about the book. In stores, it is the details on the spine that attract buyers' attention first.]]

The methods used for the printing and binding of books continued fundamentally unchanged from the 15th century into the early 20th century. While there was more [[mechanization]], a [[book printer]] in 1900 had much in common with [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]. [[Printing press|Gutenberg's invention]] was the use of movable metal types, assembled into words, lines, and pages and then printed by [[letterpress]] to create multiple copies. Modern paper books are printed on [[Printing and writing paper|papers]] designed specifically for printed books. Traditionally, book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page to the other and are (usually) made to tighter [[caliper]] or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Different paper qualities are used depending on the type of book: [[Machine finished coated paper]]s, [[woodfree uncoated paper]]s, [[coated fine paper]]s and [[special fine paper]]s are common paper grades.

Today, the majority of books are printed by [[offset lithography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BNCODAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Today,+the+majority+of+books+are+printed+by+offset+lithography#v=onepage&amp;q=Today,%20the%20majority%20of%20books%20are%20printed%20by%20offset%20lithography&amp;f=false|title=The Complete Canadian Book Editor|last=Vermeer|first=Leslie|date=2016-08-31|publisher=Brush Education|isbn=9781550596779|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a book is printed, the pages are laid out on the plate so that after the printed sheet is folded the pages will be in the correct sequence. Books tend to be manufactured nowadays in a few standard sizes. The [[Book size|sizes of books]] are usually specified as "trim size": the size of the page after the sheet has been folded and trimmed. The standard sizes result from sheet sizes (therefore machine sizes) which became popular 200 or 300 years ago, and have come to dominate the industry. British conventions in this regard prevail throughout the English-speaking world, except for the USA. The European book manufacturing industry works to a completely different set of standards.

===Processes===

====Layout====
Modern bound books are organized according to a particular format called the book's ''layout''.  Although there is great variation in layout, modern books tend to adhere to as set of rules with regard to what the parts of the layout are and what their content usually includes.  A basic layout will include a ''front cover'', a ''back cover'', and the book's content which is called its ''body copy'' or ''content pages''.  The front cover often bears the book's title (and subtitle, if any) and the name of its author or editor(s).  The ''inside front cover'' page is usually left blank in both hardcover and paperback books.  The next section, if present, is the book's ''front matter'', which includes all textual material after the front cover but not part of the book's content— such things as a forward, a dedication, and a table of contents as well as publisher data such as the book's edition or printing number and place of publication.  Between the body copy and the back cover goes the ''end matter'' which would include any indices, sets of tables, or diagrams, glossaries, or lists of cited works (though an edited book with multiple contributing authors usually places cited works at the end of each authored chapter).   The ''inside back cover'' page, like that inside the front cover, is usually blank.  The ''back cover'' itself is the usual place for the book's [[ISBN]], and maybe a photograph of the author(s)/ editor(s), perhaps with a short introduction to them.  Also here often appear plot summaries, barcodes, and excerpted reviews of the book.&lt;ref name="ShellyStarks2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gary B. Shelly|author2=Joy L. Starks|title=Microsoft Publisher 2010: Comprehensive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSQJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA559|date=6 January 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-133-17147-8|page=559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Printing====
[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits.jpg|thumb|Book covers]]
Some books, particularly those with shorter runs (i.e. fewer copies) will be printed on sheet-fed offset presses, but most books are now printed on web presses, which are fed by a continuous roll of paper, and can consequently print more copies in a shorter time. As the production line circulates, a complete "book" is collected together in one stack, next to another, and another A [[web press]] carries out the folding itself, delivering bundles of ''signatures'' (sections) ready to go into the gathering line. Note that the pages of a book are printed two at a time, not as one complete book. Excess numbers are printed to make up for any spoilage due to make-readies or test pages to assure final print quality.

A ''make-ready'' is the preparatory work carried out by the pressmen to get the printing press up to the required quality of [[Impression (publishing)|impression]]. Included in make-ready is the time taken to mount the plate onto the machine, clean up any mess from the previous job, and get the press up to speed. As soon as the pressman decides that the printing is correct, all the make-ready sheets will be discarded, and the press will start making books. Similar make readies take place in the folding and binding areas, each involving spoilage of paper.

====Binding====
After the signatures are folded and gathered, they move into the [[bindery]]. In the middle of last century there were still many trade binders – stand-alone binding companies which did no printing, specializing in binding alone. At that time, because of the dominance of letterpress printing, typesetting and printing took place in one location, and binding in a different factory. When type was all metal, a typical book's worth of type would be bulky, fragile and heavy. The less it was moved in this condition the better: so printing would be carried out in the same location as the typesetting. Printed sheets on the other hand could easily be moved. Now, because of increasing [[Automation|computerization]] of preparing a book for the printer, the typesetting part of the job has flowed upstream, where it is done either by separately contracting companies working for the publisher, by the publishers themselves, or even by the authors. Mergers in the book manufacturing industry mean that it is now unusual to find a bindery which is not also involved in book printing (and vice versa).

If the book is a [[hardcover|hardback]] its path through the bindery will involve more points of activity than if it is a [[paperback]]. Unsewn binding, is now increasingly common. The signatures of a book can also be held together by "Smyth sewing" using needles, "McCain sewing", using drilled holes often used in schoolbook binding, or "notch binding", where gashes about an inch long are made at intervals through the fold in the spine of each signature. The rest of the binding process is similar in all instances. Sewn and notch bound books can be bound as either hardbacks or paperbacks.

===Finishing===
[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (3).jpg|thumb|Book pages]]
"Making cases" happens off-line and prior to the book's arrival at the binding line. In the most basic case-making, two pieces of cardboard are placed onto a glued piece of cloth with a space between them into which is glued a thinner board cut to the width of the spine of the book. The overlapping edges of the cloth (about 5/8" all round) are folded over the boards, and pressed down to adhere. After case-making the stack of cases will go to the [[foil stamping]] area for adding decorations and type.

==Digital printing==
Recent developments in book manufacturing include the development of digital printing. Book pages are printed, in much the same way as an office copier works, using [[toner]] rather than ink. Each book is printed in one pass, not as separate signatures. Digital printing has permitted the manufacture of much smaller quantities than offset, in part because of the absence of make readies and of spoilage. One might think of a web press as printing quantities over 2000, quantities from 250 to 2000 being printed on sheet-fed presses, and digital presses doing quantities below 250. These numbers are of course only approximate and will vary from supplier to supplier, and from book to book depending on its characteristics. Digital printing has opened up the possibility of print-on-demand, where no books are printed until after an order is received from a customer.

=== E-book ===
{{main article|e-book}}
[[File:Amazon Kindle 3.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A screen of a [[Amazon Kindle|Kindle]] e-reader.]]
In the 2000s, due to the rise in availability of affordable handheld computing devices, the opportunity to share texts through electronic means became an appealing option for media publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libraries.pewinternet.org/2012/04/04/the-rise-of-e-reading/|title=The rise of e-reading|last=Rainie|first=Lee|last2=Zickuhr|first2=Kathryn|date=2012-04-04|website=Pew Internet Libraries|access-date=2017-02-02|last3=Purcell|first3=Kristen|last4=Madden|first4=Mary|last5=Brenner|first5=Joanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the "e-book" was made. The term e-book is a contraction of "electronic book"; it refers to a book-length publication in digital form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.builderbill-diy-help.com/what-is-an-ebook.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722033703/http://www.builderbill-diy-help.com/what-is-an-ebook.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 22, 2012|title=What is an e-book|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An e-book is usually made available through the internet, but also on CD-ROM and other forms. E-Books may be read either via a computing device with an LED display such as a traditional [[computer]], a [[smartphone]] or a [[tablet computer]]; or by means of a portable e-ink display device known as an e-book reader, such as the [[Sony Reader]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble Nook]], [[Kobo eReader]], or the [[Amazon Kindle]]. E-book readers attempt to mimic the experience of reading a print book by using this technology, since the displays on e-book readers are much less reflective.

== Design ==
{{main article|Book design}}

Book design is the art of incorporating the content, style, format, design, and sequence of the various components of a book into a coherent whole. In the words of Jan Tschichold, book design "though largely forgotten today, methods and rules upon which it is impossible to improve have been developed over centuries. To produce perfect books these rules have to be brought back to life and applied." Richard Hendel describes book design as "an arcane subject" and refers to the need for a context to understand what that means. Many different creators can contribute to book design, including [[graphic design]]ers, [[artist]]s and editors.

== Sizes ==
{{main article|Book size}}
[[File:Codex Gigas facsimile.jpg|thumb|Real-size [[facsimile]] of [[Codex Gigas]]]]
[[File:Kyauksa.JPG|thumb|A page from the [[world's largest book]]. Each page is three and a half feet wide, five feet tall and a little over five inches thick]]
The size of a modern book is based on the printing area of a common flatbed press. The pages of type were arranged and clamped in a frame, so that when printed on a sheet of paper the full size of the press, the pages would be right side up and in order when the sheet was folded, and the folded edges trimmed.

The most common book sizes are:
* Quarto (4to): the sheet of paper is folded twice, forming four leaves (eight pages) approximately 11–13&amp;nbsp;inches (c. 30&amp;nbsp;cm) tall
* Octavo (8vo): the most common size for current hardcover books. The sheet is folded three times into eight leaves (16 pages) up to 9 ¾" (c. 23 cm) tall.
* DuoDecimo (12mo): a size between 8vo and 16mo, up to 7 ¾" (c. 18&amp;nbsp;cm) tall
* Sextodecimo (16mo): the sheet is folded four times, forming 16 leaves (32 pages) up to 6 ¾" (c. 15 cm) tall

Sizes smaller than 16mo are:
* 24mo: up to 5 ¾" (c. 13&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 32mo: up to 5" (c. 12&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 48mo: up to 4" (c. 10&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* 64mo: up to 3" (c. 8&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

Small books can be called ''booklets''.

Sizes larger than quarto are:
* Folio: up to 15" (c. 38&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Elephant Folio: up to 23" (c. 58&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Atlas Folio: up to 25" (c. 63&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.
* Double Elephant Folio: up to 50" (c. 127&amp;nbsp;cm) tall.

The largest extant medieval manuscript in the world is [[Codex Gigas]] 92 × 50 × 22&amp;nbsp;cm. The [[world's largest book]] is made of stone and is in [[Kuthodaw Pagoda]] ([[Burma]]).

== Types ==

=== By content ===
[[File:Polish sci fi fantasy books.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Novel]]s in a [[bookstore]]]]
A common separation by content are [[fiction]] and [[non-fiction]] books. This simple separation can be found in most [[collection (museum)|collections]], [[library|libraries]], and [[bookstore]]s.

==== Fiction ====
Many of the books published today are fiction, meaning that they are in-part or completely untrue. Historically, paper production was considered too expensive to be used for [[entertainment]]. An increase in global [[literacy]] and [[printing|print]] technology led to the increased publication of books for the purpose of entertainment, and allegorical [[social commentary]]. Most fiction is additionally categorized by [[genre]].

The '''[[novel]]''' is the most common form of fiction book. Novels are stories that typically feature a [[plot (narrative)|plot]], [[setting (fiction)|setting]], [[theme (literature)|themes]] and [[character (arts)|characters]]. Stories and narrative are not restricted to any topic; a novel can be whimsical, serious or [[controversy|controversial]]. The novel has had a tremendous impact on entertainment and [[publishing]] [[Market (economics)|markets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Media Business; Publishers Worry After Fiction Sales Weaken |author=Edwin Mcdowell |date=October 30, 1989 |work=New York Times | id = |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/30/business/the-media-business-publishers-worry-after-fiction-sales-weaken.html |accessdate =January 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[novella]] is a term sometimes used for fiction [[prose]] typically between 17,500 and 40,000 words, and a [[Novella|novelette]] between 7,500 and 17,500. A [[short story]] may be any length up to 10,000 words, but these word lengths vary.

'''[[Comic book]]s''' or '''[[graphic novel]]s''' are books in which the story is illustrated. The characters and narrators use speech or thought bubbles to express verbal language.

==== Non-fiction ====
[[File:Stefan Ramult-Pomeranian Dictionary.png|upright|thumb|left|A page from a [[dictionary]]]]
In a library, a [[reference book]] is a general type of non-fiction book which provides information as opposed to telling a story, essay, commentary, or otherwise supporting a point of view. An [[almanac]] is a very general reference book, usually one-volume, with lists of data and information on many topics. An [[encyclopedia]] is a book or set of books designed to have more in-depth articles on many topics. A book listing [[word]]s, their [[etymology]], meanings, and other information is called a [[dictionary]]. A book which is a collection of [[map]]s is an [[atlas]]. A more specific reference book with tables or lists of data and information about a certain topic, often intended for professional use, is often called a [[handbook]]. Books which try to list references and abstracts in a certain broad area may be called an [[index (publishing)|index]], such as ''Engineering Index'', or [[abstract (summary)|abstracts]] such as chemical abstracts and biological abstracts.
[[File:Atlas - book.jpg|right|thumb|An [[atlas]]]]

Books with technical information on how to do something or how to use some equipment are called [[instruction manual]]s. Other popular [[how-to]] books include [[cookbook]]s and [[home improvement]] books.

Students typically store and carry [[textbook]]s and [[schoolbooks]] for study purposes. [[Elementary school]] pupils often use [[workbook]]s, which are published with spaces or blanks to be filled by them for study or [[homework]]. In US [[higher education]], it is common for a student to take an exam using a [[blue book exam|blue book]].

There is a large set of books that are made only to write private ideas, notes, and accounts. These books are rarely published and are typically destroyed or remain private. [[Notebook]]s are blank papers to be written in by the user. [[Student]]s and [[writer]]s commonly use them for taking notes. [[Scientist]]s and other researchers use [[lab notebook]]s to record their notes. They often feature spiral coil bindings at the edge so that pages may easily be torn out.

[[File:MichYellowBooks.JPG|thumb|A [[telephone directory]], with business and residence listings.]]

[[Address book]]s, [[phone book]]s, and [[meeting|calendar/appointment]] books are commonly used on a daily basis for recording appointments, meetings and personal [[Address (geography)|contact information]].

Books for recording periodic entries by the user, such as daily information about a journey, are called [[logbook]]s or simply logs. A similar book for writing the owner's daily private personal events, information, and ideas is called a [[diary]] or [[personal journal]].

[[Business]]es use [[accounting]] books such as journals and [[ledger]]s to record financial data in a practice called [[bookkeeping]].

==== Other types ====
There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system. [[photograph album|Albums]] are books for holding a group of items belonging to a particular theme, such as a set of [[photograph]]s, card collections, and memorabilia. One common example is [[stamp album]]s, which are used by many hobbyists to protect and organize their collections of [[postage stamps]]. Such albums are often made using removable plastic pages held inside in a ringed binder or other similar holder. Picture books are books for children with pictures on every page and less text (or even no text).

[[Hymnal]]s are books with collections of [[music]]al [[hymn]]s that can typically be found in [[church (building)|churches]]. [[Breviary|Prayerbooks]] or [[missal]]s are books that contain written [[prayer]]s and are commonly carried by [[monk]]s, [[nun]]s, and other devoted followers or [[clergy]].

===Decodable readers and leveled books===
A leveled book collection is a set of books organized in levels of difficulty from the easy books appropriate for an emergent reader to longer more complex books adequate for advanced readers.  Decodable readers or books are a specialized type of leveled books that use decodable text only including controlled lists of words, sentences and stories consistent with the letters and phonics that have been taught to the emergent reader.  New sounds and letters are added to higher level decodable books, as the level of instruction progresses, allowing for higher levels of accuracy, comprehension and fluency.

=== By physical format ===
[[File:Latin dictionary.jpg|thumb|[[Hardcover]] books]]
[[File:Borders bookshelf.jpg|thumb|[[Paperback]] books]]

[[Hardcover]] books have a stiff binding. [[Paperback]] books have cheaper, flexible covers which tend to be less durable. An alternative to paperback is the glossy cover, otherwise known as a dust cover, found on magazines, and comic books. Spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic. Examples of spiral-bound books include teachers' manuals and [[puzzle book]]s ([[crossword]]s, [[sudoku]]).

[[Publishing]] is a process for producing pre-printed books, [[magazines]], and newspapers for the reader/user to buy.

Publishers may produce low-cost, pre-publication copies known as [[galley proof|galleys]] or 'bound proofs' for promotional purposes, such as generating reviews in advance of publication. Galleys are usually made as cheaply as possible, since they are not intended for sale.

== Libraries ==
{{main article|Library}}
[[File:Celsus-Bibliothek2.jpg|thumb|[[Celsus Library]] was built in 135 AD and could house around 12,000 scrolls.]]
Private or personal libraries made up of non-fiction and fiction books, (as opposed to the state or institutional records kept in [[archive]]s) first appeared in [[classical Greece]]. In the ancient world, the maintaining of a [[library]] was usually (but not exclusively) the privilege of a wealthy individual. These libraries could have been either private or public, i.e. for people who were interested in using them. The difference from a modern [[public library]] lies in the fact that they were usually not funded from public sources. It is estimated that in the city of Rome at the end of the 3rd century there were around 30 public libraries. Public libraries also existed in other cities of the ancient [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean region]] (for example, [[Library of Alexandria]]).&lt;ref&gt;Miriam A. Drake, ''Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science'' (Marcel Dekker, 2003), "Public Libraries, History".&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the Middle Ages, monasteries and universities had also libraries that could be accessible to general public. Typically not the whole collection was available to public, the books could not be borrowed and often were chained to reading stands to prevent theft.

The beginning of modern public library begins around 15th century when individuals started to donate books to towns.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam A. Drake, ''Encyclopedia of Library'', "Public Libraries, History".&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of a [[public library]] system in the United States started in the late 19th century and was much helped by donations from [[Andrew Carnegie]]. This reflected classes in a society: The poor or the middle class had to access most books through a public library or by other means while the rich could afford to have a [[private library]] built in their homes. In the United States the Boston Public Library 1852 ''Report of the Trustees'' established the justification for the public library as a tax-supported institution intended to extend educational opportunity and provide for general culture.&lt;ref&gt;McCook, Kathleen de la Peña (2011), ''Introduction to Public Librarianship'', 2nd ed., p. 23 New York, Neal-Schuman.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[paperback]] books in the 20th century led to an explosion of popular publishing. Paperback books made owning books affordable for many people. Paperback books often included works from genres that had previously been published mostly in [[pulp magazines]]. As a result of the low cost of such books and the spread of bookstores filled with them (in addition to the creation of a smaller market of extremely cheap used paperbacks) owning a private library ceased to be a status symbol for the rich.

In library and booksellers' catalogues, it is common to include an abbreviation such as "Crown 8vo" to indicate the [[paper size]] from which the book is made.

When rows of books are lined on a book holder, [[bookend]]s are sometimes needed to keep them from slanting.

== Identification and classification ==
[[File:ISBN.JPG|thumb|left|[[ISBN]] with [[barcode]]]]

During the 20th century, [[librarian]]s were concerned about keeping track of the many books being added yearly to the [[Gutenberg Galaxy]]. Through a global society called the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] (IFLA), they devised a series of tools including the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]] (ISBD). Each book is specified by an International Standard Book Number, or ISBN, which is unique to every edition of every book produced by participating publishers, worldwide. It is managed by the ISBN Society. An ISBN has four parts: the first part is the country code, the second the [[publisher]] code, and the third the title code. The last part is a [[check digit]], and can take values from 0–9 and X (10). The [[European Article Number|EAN]] [[Barcode]]s numbers for books are derived from the ISBN by prefixing 978, for [[Bookland]], and calculating a new check digit.

Commercial publishers in industrialized countries generally assign ISBNs to their books, so buyers may presume that the ISBN is part of a total international system, with no exceptions. However, many government publishers, in industrial as well as developing countries, do not participate fully in the ISBN system, and publish books which do not have ISBNs. A large or public collection requires a [[Library catalog|catalogue]]. Codes called "call numbers" relate the books to the catalogue, and determine their locations on the shelves. Call numbers are based on a [[Library classification]] system. The call number is placed on the spine of the book, normally a short distance before the bottom, and inside. Institutional or national standards, such as [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]/[[NISO]] Z39.41 - 1997, establish the correct way to place information (such as the [[title (publishing)|title]], or the name of the author) on book spines, and on "shelvable" book-like objects, such as containers for [[DVD]]s, [[video tape]]s and [[software]].
[[File:Wien - Volkskundemuseum-Bibliothek, Bücherspeicher.JPG|thumb|Books on library shelves and call numbers visible on the spines]]

One of the earliest and most widely known systems of cataloguing books is the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]]. Another widely known system is the [[Library of Congress Classification]] system. Both systems are biased towards subjects which were well represented in US libraries when they were developed, and hence have problems handling new subjects, such as computing, or subjects relating to other cultures.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Information about books and authors can be stored in databases like [[online general-interest book database]]s. [[Metadata]], which means "data about data" is information about a book. Metadata about a book may include its title, ISBN or other classification number (see above), the names of contributors (author, editor, illustrator) and publisher, its date and size, the language of the text, its subject matter, etc.

=== Classification systems ===
* [[Bliss bibliographic classification]] (BC)
* [[Chinese Library Classification]] (CLC)
* [[Colon Classification]]
* [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC)
* [[Harvard-Yenching Classification]]
* [[Library of Congress Classification]] (LCC)
* [[New Classification Scheme for Chinese Libraries]]
* [[Universal Decimal Classification]] (UDC)

== Uses ==
Aside from the primary purpose of reading them, books are also used for other ends:
* A book can be an artistic artifact, a piece of art; this is sometimes known as an [[artists' book]].
* A book may be evaluated by a reader or professional writer to create a [[book review]].
* A book may be read by a group of people to use as a spark for social or academic discussion, as in a [[book discussion club|book club]].
* A book may be studied by students as the subject of a writing and analysis exercise in the form of a [[book report]].
* Books are sometimes used for their exterior appearance to [[decorative arts|decorate]] a room, such as a [[study (room)|study]].

== Book marketing ==
Once the book is published, it is put on the market by the distributors and the bookstores. Meanwhile, his promotion comes from various media reports. Book marketing is governed by the law in many states.

=== Other forms of secondary spread ===
In recent years, the book had a second life in the form of reading aloud. This is called public readings of published works, with the assistance of professional readers (often known actors) and in close collaboration with writers, publishers, booksellers, librarians, leaders of the literary world and artists.

Many individual or collective practices exist to increase the number of readers of a book. Among them:
* abandonment of books in public places, coupled or not with the use of the Internet, known as the [[bookcrossing]];
* provision of free books in third places like bars or cafes;
* itinerant or temporary libraries;
* free public libraries in the area.

=== Evolution of the book industry ===
This form of the book chain has hardly changed since the eighteenth century, and has not always been this way. Thus, the author has asserted gradually with time, and the copyright dates only from the nineteenth century. For many centuries, especially before the invention of printing, each freely copied out books that passed through his hands, adding if necessary his own comments. Similarly, bookseller and publisher jobs have emerged with the invention of printing, which made the book an industrial product, requiring structures of production and marketing.

The invention of the Internet, e-readers, tablets, and projects like Wikipedia and Gutenberg, are likely to strongly change the book industry in the years to come.

== Paper and conservation ==
{{main article|Conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera}}
[[File:La fille du Cid - Upper and lower cover and spine (c151e11).jpg|thumb|Halfbound book with [[leather]] and [[marbled paper]].]]

Paper was first made in China as early as 200 BC, and reached Europe through [[History of Islam|Muslim]] territories. At first made of rags, the [[industrial revolution]] changed paper-making practices, allowing for paper to be made out of wood pulp. Papermaking in Europe began in the 11th century, although [[vellum]] was also common there as page material up until the beginning of the 16th century, vellum being the more expensive and durable option. Printers or publishers would often issue the same publication on both materials, to cater to more than one market.

Paper made from [[wood pulp]] became popular in the early 20th century, because it was cheaper than [[linen]] or [[abaca]] cloth-based papers. Pulp-based paper made books less expensive to the general public. This paved the way for huge leaps in the rate of literacy in industrialised nations, and enabled the spread of information during the [[Second Industrial Revolution]].

Pulp paper, however, contains acid which eventually destroys the paper from within. Earlier techniques for making paper used [[limestone]] rollers, which neutralized the acid in the pulp. Books printed between 1850 and 1950 are primarily at risk; more recent books are often printed on acid-free or [[alkaline]] paper. Libraries today have to consider [[mass deacidification]] of their older collections in order to prevent decay.

Stability of the climate is critical to the long-term preservation of paper and book material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Patkus | first = Beth| publication-date = 2003 | title = Assessing Preservation Needs, A Self-Survey Guide | publication-place = Andover| publisher =Northeast Document Conservation Center | postscript =&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Good air circulation is important to keep fluctuation in climate stable. The [[HVAC]] system should be up to date and functioning efficiently. Light is detrimental to collections. Therefore, care should be given to the collections by implementing light control. General housekeeping issues can be addressed, including [[pest control]]. In addition to these helpful solutions, a library must also make an effort to be prepared if a disaster occurs, one that they cannot control. Time and effort should be given to create a concise and effective disaster plan to counteract any damage incurred through "acts of God" therefore an [[emergency management]] plan should be in place.

The '''Chartered Institute of Cost and Management Accountants''' (CICMA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chartered Institute of Cost &amp; Management Accountants of Nigeria|url = http://www.introschool.com/professional-centers/431|website = www.introschool.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Nigeria]]n – based [[professional accounting body]] offering [[Accounting]] [[education]] and [[professional qualification]]s in [[cost]] and [[management]] [[accountancy]] and related subjects, focus on [[accounting]], [[business]] and [[government operations]]. The head office of the institute is in [[Kaduna]]. The institute also has regional offices at [[Abuja]], [[Kano]], [[Jos]] and [[Port Harcourt]]. As at September 2015, it had 8,200 members working in and outside [[Nigeria]]. It also has 4,500 registered students.

The institute is recognized by the [[Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Welcome To FRC|url = http://www.financialreportingcouncil.gov.ng|website = www.financialreportingcouncil.gov.ng|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in its institutions list for education and promotion of [[cost]] and [[management accounting]] in [[Nigeria]].

== History ==
The institute was founded in 2000, and was formally known as Institute of Cost and Management Accountants (ICMA). In the year 2002, the enabling Act establishing the institute commenced at the [[National Assembly (Nigeria)|Nigerian National Assembly]]. At the [[House of Representatives (Nigeria)|House of Representatives]], the word “Chartered” was added and the name of the institute was changed to “Chartered Institute of Cost and Management Accountants” On 25 May 2007, the Clerk of the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria transmitted the CICMA Bill with other fourteen Bills to the then President [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] for his assent, but he left the office without signing any of the [[Bill (law)|Bill]]s from the [[National Assembly (Nigeria)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = National Assembly {{!}} Federal Republic of Nigeria|url = http://nass.gov.ng/|website = nass.gov.ng|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act for the establishment of the institute is still pending [[Assent procedure|Assent]] and [[Gazette]].

In May 2006, an Expert Assessor's Committee from the Federal Ministry of Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Home|url = http://www.education.gov.ng|website = www.education.gov.ng|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuja, visited for assessment of the programmes and qualification of the institute in order to advise the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Office Of The Head Of The Civil Service Of The Federation - Home|url = http://www.ohcsf.gov.ng|website = www.ohcsf.gov.ng|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;(OHCSF) on the standard/rating of relevance of the professional qualifications of the institute for entry into posts in the [[Federal Civil Service Commission (Nigeria)|Federal Civil Service Commission]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federal Civil Service Commission of Nigeria|url = http://www.fedcivilservice.gov.ng|website = www.fedcivilservice.gov.ng|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Federal Civil Service Commission (Nigeria)|(Nigeria)]]. Their report states: “Having examined the Programmes and qualifications of ICMA, the Committee observed that they compare favorably with those of similar recognized accounting Bodies. It was therefore recommended that holders of [[ICMA Pakistan|ICMA]] qualifications be placed at par with their counterparts holding qualifications of similar Accounting Bodies such as [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ICAN - Welcome to Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria|url = http://www.icanig.org|website = www.icanig.org|accessdate = 2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria|(ICAN)]] and [[Association of National Accountants of Nigeria|Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ANAN {{!}} Association of National Accountants of Nigeria|url = http://www.anan.org.ng|website = www.anan.org.ng|accessdate = 2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 2006 CICMA established an offshoot known as the Association of Cost and Management Accountants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ASSOCIATION OF COST AND MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTANTS|url = http://acma.org.ng/|website = acma.org.ng|accessdate = 2015-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the institute was listed among approved professional bodies in Nigeria by the Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Registration Information|url = http://www.financialreportingcouncil.gov.ng/index.php/registration/registration-information|website = www.financialreportingcouncil.gov.ng|accessdate = 2015-12-09|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151219163804/http://financialreportingcouncil.gov.ng/index.php/registration/registration-information#|archive-date = 2015-12-19|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership and certification==
CICMA has two grades of full membership, Associate Members use the designatory letters "ACMA" and Fellow Members use the designatory letters "FCMA".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7749">'''Conflict [[economics]]''' is a branch of economics that puts the allocation of resources by means of violent fighting, i.e. conflict, into [[economic models]].

In traditional economics, appropriation is a non-violent process that is guaranteed by perfect property rights and their costless enforcement.&lt;ref name="besley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Besley |first=Timothy |last2=Ghatak |first2=Maitreesh |title=Handbook of Development Economics, Volume 5 |year=2009 |publisher=North Holland |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-444-52944-2 |pages=4252–4595 |editor1-last=Rodrick |editor1-first=Dani |editor2-last=Rosenzweig |editor2-first=Mark R. |chapter=Property Rights and Economic Development |url=http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/mghatak/handbook.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Conflict economics sheds a different light on appropriation. It is set in a model of contest between two players. Conflict economics introduces the idea that [[Agent (economics)|agents]] have to decide between production of [[Resource (economics)|resources]] and production of guns, i.e. tools that have the sole purposes of appropriating the resources produced by the other player. Different models are introduced to illustrate various situations that have similarities to real life conflicts.

==Resource conflict model==
Two parties contest a given resource Z. The player who wins the contest claims the entire resource, not leaving anything for the losing party. The [[Probability|probabilities]] of winning are determined by each party’s choice of guns.

==Guns vs. butter model==
In this model, agents face a [[trade-off]] between producing themselves and grabbing the [[Output (economics)|output]] of the other agent. Each party is endowed with a secure resource R. The resource cannot be [[Consumption (economics)|consumed]] directly but has to be allocated between producing guns (tools for conflict) or butter (consumption). Again, the probability of winning the contest and grabbing the other output depend on the relative numbers of guns produced.  This model allows testing of different [[power structure]]s between the players. One of the interesting outcomes is that if one agent has higher [[Productivity (economics)|productivity]], i.e. if he uses one unit of the resource he will gain more butter than his opponent would, he will receive a relatively lower expected pay-off. This is due to the fact that each player will then exploit his or her [[comparative advantage]], with the more productive player producing more butter and the less productive player producing more guns, resulting in a higher chance of winning the conflict thus leading to a higher expected [[payoff matrix|pay-off]].&lt;ref name=hirshleifer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hirshleifer |first=Jack |title=THE PARADOX OF POWER |journal=Economics and Politics |date=1 November 1991 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=177–200 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0343.1991.tb00046.x |url=http://www.econ.ucla.edu/people/papers/hirshleifer/hirshleifer190.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settlement in the shadow of conflict==
Conflict is not the only way that parties can appropriate resources. Depending on the [[risk#Risk attitude.2C appetite and tolerance|risk preferences]] of the agents, a simple division of the contested resource according to a settlement can be envisioned. A two-stage [[Game theory|game]] serves to illustrate this. In the first stage, parties make their gun choices. In the second stage, negotiations take place. If the negotiations are successful, the players agree on a division and share the good.

If the negotiations are not successful, conflict ensues with the winning party again taking the whole resource. This two-stage model is especially interesting if one includes the possibility of destruction into the model, i.e. in case of conflict the winner is left with only a part of the contested resource. Parties might prefer settlement over conflict if they have an aversion to uncertainty (outcome of conflict dependent on probabilities) or destruction.

However, in the long term conflict might be the dominant strategy. Introducing a discount rate for payoffs in the future might induce players to start conflict in the present. Defeating your opponent in the present will secure the resource for you in the future (opponent is eliminated), thus not having to share it in a settlement.&lt;ref name="ssrn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garfinkel |first1=Michelle R. |last2=Skaperdas |first2=Stergios |title=Economics of conflict: an overview |journal= |doi=10.2139/ssrn.895307 |ssrn=895307 |date=1 January 2006 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict, alliances and group structures==
Conflict might not occur between two agents only, but a number of agents can be involved in hostilities. Individuals and parties have been repeatedly proven to form [[Political alliance|alliances]] to achieve a common goal. There are cost advantages to be realized&lt;ref name="noh"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Noh |first=Suk Jae |title=Resource distribution and stable alliances with endogenous sharing rules |journal=[[European Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=129–151 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |doi=10.1016/S0176-2680(01)00072-6 |date=March 2002 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0176-2680(01)00072-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the sum of individual efforts creates [[synergy#Human synergy|synergies]] that cannot be realized by individuals on their own.&lt;ref name="skaperdas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skaperdas |first=Stergios |title=On the formation of alliances in conflict and contests |journal=[[Public Choice (journal)|Public Choice]] |volume=96 |issue=1–2 |pages=25–42 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |doi=10.1023/A:1004912124496 |jstor=30024376 |date=July 1998 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1004912124496 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; However one has to keep in mind that if individuals work together there are always [[incentive]]s for "free riding."&lt;ref name="olson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Olson |first=Mancur |authorlink=Mancur Olson |title=The logic of collective action: public goods and the theory of groups |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1971 |origyear=1965 |edition=revised |isbn=978-0-674-53751-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In conflict economics, group conflict builds upon the resource conflict model. A two-stage game is constructed. In the first stage (inter-group conflict) groups and individuals compete for the resource. The probabilities of winning depend on the effort, i.e. number of guns, that individuals are contributing to the group. In the second stage (intra-group conflict) the successful group allocates the won resource among its members. This allocation can be according to the efforts that individuals spent, contracts or just an equal distribution according to the number of members.

However group structures have been found to be more unstable the higher the number of individuals there are in the group. Individuals have higher [[payoff matrix|expected payoff]] by switching to a group with less individuals or forming a stand-alone alliance. For alliances to be stable they have to be roughly the same sizes&lt;ref name="yi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yi |first=Sang-Seung |title=Stable coalition structures with externalities |journal= |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2071 |ssrn=2071 |date=1 January 1996   |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[symmetric]].&lt;ref name="ssrn" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">The '''critical apparatus''' ({{lang-la|apparatus criticus}}) is the critical and [[primary source]] material that accompanies an edition of a text. A critical apparatus is often a by-product of [[textual criticism]].

Many editions employ a standard format for a critical apparatus, as illustrated by a line from ''[[Hamlet]]'', which the Oxford ''Complete Works'' (1988) prints as follows:&lt;ref&gt;William Shakespeare, ''The Complete Works'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), p. 682&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|{{sc|LAERTES}}. Alas, then is she drowned.}}

The apparatus for the line might be rendered as:&lt;ref&gt;Suggested by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor, ''William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1997), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|4.7.156 Alas, then is she drowned.] {{sc|'''HIBBARD'''}}; Alas then, is she drown'd? '''F''';&lt;br&gt;Alas then is she drownd. '''Q3'''; Alas, then, she is drownd. '''Q2''';&lt;br/&gt;So, she is drownde: '''Q1'''.}}

The format of the apparatus has several parts:
* The location of the variant in the text (act, scene, line number)
* The ''lemma'', which is the portion of the text to which the note applies
* A right bracket (])
* The source from which the edition took its reading
* A list of variants, in each case followed by the source in which the variant is found, and set off with a semicolon.

To save space, frequently cited sources are usually assigned an abbreviation called a ''siglum''. In Shakespeare editions, '''F''' always signifies the [[First Folio]]; the second through fourth folios are referred to as '''F2''' through '''F4''' respectively. Similarly, '''Q1''' is the first [[quarto]], '''Q2''' the second quarto, and '''Q3''' the third.

In the example given, the first folio ('''F''') and the three early quartos ('''Q1''' to '''Q3''') each have a different reading of the line in question. The editors have concluded that all four early sources are corrupt, and instead have adopted a reading suggested by [[G. R. Hibbard]]. Other editors of the play may choose a different reading of the line. The apparatus summarizes all of the textual evidence, allowing readers to assess for themselves whether the editor has made the best choice. Sometimes the editor will add a commentary, defending the choice made, explaining why other readings were rejected, or discussing how other editors have treated the passage.

This format has been used for critical apparatuses of [[Shakespeare]] and many other authors. In [[variorum]] editions, the apparatus is often placed at the bottom of the page. Sometimes a three-part format is employed, with the main text at the top of the page, textual variants in the middle, and the editor's commentary at the bottom. This remains the most common format for Shakespeare editions, although the Oxford ''Complete Works'' breaks with tradition by putting its critical apparatus in a separately published volume.

In the United States, bibliographer [[Fredson Bowers]] established a tradition of putting the critical apparatus at the back of the book, leaving the edited text clear of apparatus. This has the advantage of leaving the main text uncluttered with editorial details that may not be of interest to the general reader. However, this format is a disadvantage to scholarly readers, who are not able to see all of the textual evidence in one place.

==Bible==
The first printed edition of the [[New Testament]] with ''critical apparatus'', noting variant readings among the manuscripts, was produced by the printer [[Robert Estienne]] of Paris in 1550. The Greek text of this edition and of those of Erasmus became known as the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' (Latin for "received text"), a name given to it in the [[House of Elzevir|Elzevier]] edition of 1633, which termed it as the text ''nunc ab omnibus receptum'' ("now received by all").

==Electronic representation==
The de facto standard for the representation of critical apparatus in digital scholarly editions is to follow the recommendations of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/TC.html&lt;/ref&gt; While other formats are also used in digital literary studies this has become the most accepted storage format.&lt;ref&gt; See also James Cummings, "[http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&amp;chunk.id=ss1-6-6&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ss1-6-6&amp;brand=9781405148641_brand The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature]" in 'A Companion to Digital Literary Studies', ed.

The '''Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model''', referred to as the '''DICE model''' or '''Dice model''', is a computer-based [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment model]] developed by 2018 Nobel Laureate [[William Nordhaus]] that “integrates in an end-to-end fashion the economics, carbon cycle, climate science, and impacts in a highly aggregated model that allows a weighing of the costs and benefits of taking steps to slow greenhouse warming." Nordhaus also developed the RICE model ('''Regional Integrated Climate-Economy model'''), a variant of the DICE model that was updated and developed alongside the DICE model.&lt;ref name=epa-summary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/ee/epa/eerm.nsf/vwan/ee-0564-114.pdf/$file/ee-0564-114.pdf|title = Summary of the DICE model|last = Newbold|first = Stephen|date = November 2010|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dice-till-2006&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/williamdnordhaus/dice-rice|title = DICE/RICE models - William Nordhaus - Yale Economics|date = October 2017|accessdate = October 11, 2018|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roll-dice&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/web%20rice%20summary%20102599.htm|title = Summary of ''Roll the DICE Again: The Economics of Global Warming''|last = Nordhaus|first = William|last2 = Boyer|first2 = Joseph|date = October 1999|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=epa-record/&gt; Researchers who collaborated with Nordhaus to develop the model include David Popp, Zili Yang, and Joseph Boyer.&lt;ref name=dice-till-2006/&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===

According to a summary of the DICE and RICE models prepared by Stephen Newbold,&lt;ref name=epa-summary/&gt; the earliest precursor to DICE was a [[linear programming]] model of energy supply and demand in two 1977 papers of William Nordhaus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cm/m26/m26-08.pdf|title = Strategies for the control of carbon dioxide (Cowles Foundation discussion paper no. 443|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|year =  1977|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/carbondixoideproblem.pdf|title = Economic Growth and Climate: The Carbon Dioxide Problem|last = Nordhaus|first = Wiliam|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = February 1977|accessdate = February 19, 2014|pages = 341–346|publisher = [[American Economic Review]]|volume = 67|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although dynamic (in that it considered the changing levels of supply of fuel based on supply and demand and the consequence impact on carbon dioxide emissions) the model did not attempt to measure the economic ''impact'' of climate change.&lt;ref name=epa-summary/&gt; A 1991 paper by Nordhaus developed a steady-state model of both the economy and climate, coming quite close to the DICE model.&lt;ref name=epa-summary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2233864?uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103423736481|title = To Slow or Not to Slow: The Economics of the Greenhouse Effect.|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|accessdate = February 19, 2014|journal = [[The Economic Journal]]|volume = 101|number = 407|date = July 1991|doi=10.2307/2233864|pages=920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The model===

The model appears to have first been proposed by economist [[William Nordhaus]] in a discussion paper for the [[Cowles Foundation]] in February 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cd/d10a/d1009.pdf|title = The "Dice" Model: Background and Structure of a Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy Model of the Economics of Global Warming (Cowles Foundation discussion paper no. 1009)|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = February 1992|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a brief note outlining the main ideas in an article for ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in November 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = An Optimal Transition Path for Controlling Greenhouse Gases|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/%7Enordhaus/homepage/Optimal.science.1192.pdf|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume = 258|date = November 20, 1992|accessdate = February 19, 2014|doi=10.1126/science.258.5086.1315|pages=1315–1319}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent revised model was published in ''[[Resource and Energy Economics]]'' in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/dice_section_II.html|title = Original DICE and RICE models|accessdate = February 19, 2014|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Rolling the 'DICE': An Optimal Transition Path for Controlling Greenhouse Gases|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|volume = 15|year = 1993|journal = [[Resource and Energy Economics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nordhaus published an improved version of the model in the October 1994 book ''Managing the Global Commons: The Economics of Climate Change'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Managing the Global Commons: The Economics of Climate Change|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = October 4, 1994|publisher = [[MIT Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the first chapter as well as an appendix containing a computer program both freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/manageapp.htm|title = Appendix.

In 1996, Nordhaus and Zili Yang published an article titled ''A regional dynamic general-equilibrium model of alternative climate-change strategies'' at [[The American Economic Review]], established the RICE (Regional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) model.&lt;ref&gt;WD Nordhaus, Z Yang - A regional dynamic general-equilibrium model of alternative climate-change strategies The American Economic Review, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1998, Nordhaus published a revised version of the DICE model in multiple papers, one of which was coauthored with Joseph Boyer in order to understand the effects of the proposed [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/dice_section_III.html|title = III.

In 1999, Nordhaus published computer programs and spreadsheets implementing a revised version of the DICE model as well as a variant called the RICE model (RICE stands for ''Regional Integrated Climate-Economics'', signifying that the modeling of economics and climate are being done only for a particular region rather than the whole world).&lt;ref name=section-iv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/dice_section_IV.html|title = GAMS Computer Programs for RICE-99|last = Nordhaus|first = William|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=section-v&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/dice_section_V.html|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|title = Spreadsheet Versions of DICE-99 and RICE-99 models|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Nordhaus and Boyer co-authored a book published by [[MIT Press]] titled ''Warming the World: Economic Models of Global Warming'' with a detailed description of the updated DICE and RICE models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/web%20table%20of%20contents%20102599.htm|title = Warming the World: Economic Models of Global Warming (hardcover)|last = Nordhaus|first = William|last2 = Boyer|first2 = Joseph|date = August 21, 2000|accessdate = February 19, 2014|publisher = [[MIT Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Nordhaus published revised spreadsheets for the RICE model.&lt;ref name=section-vi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/dice_section_vi.html|title = Spreadsheet Version of RICE-2001 Model Used for Science Article|accessdate = February 19, 2014|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, Nordhaus published a new version of the DICE model with updated data, and used it to review the [[Stern Review]].&lt;ref name=dice-till-2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/D_111606_alt_base.GMS|title = DICE model recalibrated to data for November 2006|date = November 16, 2006|accessdate = February 19, 2014|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/DICE_documentation_111706.pdf|title = Documentation for DICE-2006, November 2006 round|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = November 17, 2006|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, updated RICE and DICE models were published, and the new RICE model was explained by Nordhaus in an article for the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' (US).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/documents/Nordhaus_Copenhagen_2010_text.pdf|title = Economic aspects of global warming in a post-Copenhagen environment|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = May 10, 2010|accessdate = February 19, 2014|doi=10.1073/pnas.1005985107 |journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]|volume=107|pages=11721–11726|pmid=20547856|pmc=2900661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/RICEmodels.htm|title = RICE-2010 and DICE-2010 Models (as of March 20, 2012)|last = Nordhaus|first = William|date = March 20, 2012|accessdate = February 19, 2014|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the book ''The Climate Casino'' by Nordhaus, with updated discussion of the DICE and RICE models and the broader policy implications, was published by [[Yale University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Climate Casino: Risk, Uncertainty, and Economics for a Warming World|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|date = October 22, 2013|publisher = [[Yale University Press]]|isbn = 978-0300189773}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A background on the latest version of the models as used in the book was published on Nordhaus' website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/ClimateCasino.htm|title = Background on the DICE Models For Readers of ''The Climate Casino'' (2013)|last = Nordhaus|first = William|authorlink = William Nordhaus|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nordhaus/homepage/DICE-science.htm|title = Scientific and Economic Background on DICE-2013R Model as of January 22, 2014|last = Nordhaus|first = William|date = January 22, 2014|accessdate = February 19, 2014|authorlink = William Nordhaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Academic reception===

A number of variants of the DICE model have been published by researchers working separately from Nordhaus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ssrn=2270473|title = A 4-Stated Dice: Quantitatively Addressing Uncertainty Effects in Climate Chan|last = Traeger|first = Christian|date = December 1, 2013|accessdate = February 19, 2014|publisher = [[Social Science Research Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Popp |first=David |title=Entice: Endogenous Technological Change In The DICE Model Of Global Warming |journal=Journal of Environmental Economics and Management |year=2004 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=742–768 |doi=10.1016/j.jeem.2003.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DICE model is also included in advanced university coursework related to environmental and energy economics and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://are.berkeley.edu/~traeger/Lectures/ClimateChangeEconomics/Slides/6%20Integrated%20Assessment%20-%201%20Integrated%20Assessment%20of%20Climate%20Change%20and%20DICE.pdf|title = The Economics of Climate Change -C175|last = Traeger|first = Christian|publisher = [[University of California, Berkeley]]|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception in the public policy world===

The DICE and RICE models have received considerable attention from others studying the economic impact of climate change. it is one of the models used by the Environmental Protection Agency for estimating the [[social cost of carbon]].&lt;ref name=epa-record/&gt;&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt; Stephen Newbold of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] in the [[United States]] reviewed the models in 2010.&lt;ref name=epa-summary/&gt;

The [[Basque Centre for Climate Change]], in an October 2009 review of [[integrated assessment modelling|integrated assessment models]] for climate change, discussed the DICE model in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc3research.org/working_papers/downpubli_6.html|title = Integrated Impact Assessment Models of Climate Change with an Emphasis on Damage Functions: a Literature Review|author = Ramon Arigoni Ortiz|author2 = Anil Markandya|date = October 2009|accessdate = February 19, 2014|publisher = [[Basque Centre for Climate Change]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report from the [[Heritage Foundation]], a [[conservatism (politics)|conservative]] [[think tank]] in the [[United States]], called the DICE model "flawed beyond use for policymaking" on account of its extreme sensitivity to initial assumptions.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2013/11/loaded-dice-an-epa-model-not-ready-for-the-big-game|title = Loaded DICE: An EPA Model Not Ready for the Big Game|last = Dayaratna|first = Kevin|last2 = Kreutzer|first2 = David|date = November 21, 2013|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar criticisms, including criticisms of the specific choice of discount rates chosen in the model, have been made by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realclimateeconomics.org/briefs/Stanton_Towards_Greater_Transparency.pdf |title=Towards Greater Transparency in Climate Economics: Deconstructing DICE-2007 (a brief prepared for Economics for Equity and the Environment Network) |last=Stanton |first=Elizabeth |date=April 2009 |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723012842/http://realclimateeconomics.org/briefs/Stanton_Towards_Greater_Transparency.pdf |archivedate=July 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lomborg-errors.dk/EconomicModels.htm|title = Criticism of economic models|publisher = Lomborg-errors.dk|accessdate = February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecomusicology''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] οἶκος, meaning "house"; μουσική, "music"; and -λογία, "study of-") is an academic discipline concerned with the study of music, culture, and [[nature]], and considers musical and sonic issues, both textual and performative, related to ecology and the natural environment. It is in essence a mixture of [[ecocriticism]] and [[musicology]] (rather than "ecology" and "musicology"), in [[Charles Seeger]]'s holistic definition.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{Citation | last = Allen | first = Aaron S. | contribution = Ecomusicology | year = forthcoming 2013 | title = Grove Dictionary of American Music | publisher = New York: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ecomusicology.info"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecomusicology.info – Main Page|url=http://www.ecomusicology.info|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

With the increasing intertwined interest in the environment and the sciences in North America from the 1970s, there has been an increase in interest in the term ecomusicology, which was established as a term in the early 21st century in North American and Scandinavian circles.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt; As a field, ecomusicology was created out of a common area of interest between the fields of ecocriticism and musicology, expressed by a range of scholars and artists such as composers, [[acoustic ecology|acoustic ecologists]], [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologists]], [[biomusicology|biomusicologists]], and others.&lt;ref name="jams"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Allen | first = Aaron S. | title = Ecomusicology: Ecocriticism and Musicology | journal = [[Journal of the American Musicological Society]] | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 392–393 | date = Summer 2011 | url = http://www.ecomusicology.info/wp-content/uploads/Supplementary/JAMS_Ecomusicology_Colloquy.pdf | accessdate = 2013-04-01 | doi=10.1525/jams.2011.64.2.391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecomusicology embraces what is today considered the field of historical musicology, [[ethnomusicology]], and related [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] fields, which while at the same time may enable specialists within each of these fields to interact with academics in the other fields in their approach, it also provides individuals with flexibility to approach an ecocritical study of music through a variety of disciplines and fields.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31500">'''Engineering ethics''' is the field of [[applied ethics]] and system of moral principles that apply to the practice of [[engineering]]. The field examines and sets the obligations by [[engineer]]s to [[society]], to their clients, and to the profession.  As a scholarly discipline, it is closely related to subjects such as the [[philosophy of science]], the [[philosophy of engineering]], and the [[ethics of technology]].

==Background and origins==

===The 18th century and growing concern===
[[File:Original Tay Bridge before the 1879 collapse.jpg|thumb|The first [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge collapsed]] in 1879. At least sixty were killed.]]
As engineering rose as a distinct profession during the 19th century, engineers saw themselves as either independent professional practitioners or technical employees of large enterprises. There was considerable tension between the two sides as large industrial employers fought to maintain control of their employees.&lt;ref&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States growing professionalism gave rise to the development of four founding engineering societies: The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) (1851), the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE) (1884),&lt;ref name = "AIEE to IEEE"&gt;The AIEE merged with the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] (IRE) (1912) in 1963 to form the IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) (1880), and the [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers|American Institute of Mining Engineers]] (AIME) (1871).&lt;ref name = "AIME"&gt;AIME is now the umbrella organization of four technical societies: the [http://www.smenet.org/ Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration] (SME) (1957), [[The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society (TMS)|The Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society]] (TMS) (1957), the [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] (SPE) (1957), and the [http://www.aist.org Association For Iron and Steel Technology] (AIST) (1974). Neither AIME, nor its subsidiary societies have adopted a formal code of ethics.&lt;/ref&gt; ASCE and AIEE were more closely identified with the engineer as learned professional, where ASME, to an extent, and AIME almost entirely, identified with the view that the engineer is a technical employee.&lt;ref name = "Layton p. 35"&gt;Layton (1986) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even so, at that time ethics was viewed as a personal rather than a broad professional concern.&lt;ref name = "ASCE Standard, p. 10"&gt;ASCE (2000). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASCE code of ethics"&gt;{{cite web

===Turning of the  20th century and turning point===
[[File:BostonMolassesDisaster.jpg|thumb|The [[Boston molasses disaster]] provided a strong impetus for the establishment of professional licensing and codes of ethics in the United States.]]When the 19th century drew to a close and the 20th century began, there had been series of significant [[structural failure]]s, including some spectacular [[List of bridge disasters|bridge failures]], notably the [[Ashtabula River Railroad Disaster]] (1876), [[Tay Bridge disaster|Tay Bridge Disaster]] (1879), and the [[Quebec Bridge#Collapse of August 29.2C 1907|Quebec Bridge collapse]] (1907). These had a profound effect on engineers and forced the profession to confront shortcomings in technical and construction practice, as well as ethical standards.&lt;ref&gt;ASME member H.F.J. Porter had proposed as early as 1892 that the engineering societies adopt uniform membership, education, and licensing requirements as well as a code of ethics. (Layton (1986). pp. 45-46)&lt;/ref&gt;

One response was the development of formal codes of ethics by three of the four founding engineering societies. AIEE adopted theirs in 1912. ASCE and ASME did so in 1914.&lt;ref name = "Layton pp. 70 &amp; 114"&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 70 &amp; 114.&lt;/ref&gt; AIME did not adopt a code of ethics in its history.&lt;ref name = "Layton p. 35"/&gt;

Concerns for professional practice and protecting the public highlighted by these bridge failures, as well as the [[Boston molasses disaster]] (1919), provided impetus for another movement that had been underway for some time: to require formal credentials (Professional Engineering licensure in the US) as a requirement to [[Professional Engineer|practice]]. This involves meeting some combination of educational, experience, and testing requirements.&lt;ref name = "Layton pp. 124-125"&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|Association of German Engineers]] developed an oath for all its members titled 'The Confession of the Engineers', directly hinting at the role of engineers in the atrocities committed during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technische Intelligenz und "Kulturfaktor Technik" |editor-last=Dietz |editor-first=Burkhard |date=1996 |pages=29 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=FGfkMqguYd4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technik und Verantwortung im Nationalsozialismus |date=2004 |last=Lorenz |first=Werner |last2=Meyer |first2=Torsen |pages=55 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9ClQ9yxA7-QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vdi.de/fileadmin/media/content/hg/16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following decades most American states and Canadian provinces either required engineers to be licensed, or passed special legislation reserving title rights to organization of professional engineers.&lt;ref name = "Layton"&gt;Layton (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian model is to require all persons working in fields of engineering that posed a risk to life, health, property, the public welfare and the environment to be licensed, and all provinces required licensing by the 1950s.

The US model has generally been only to require the practicing engineers offering engineering services that impact the public welfare, safety, safeguarding of life, health, or property to be licensed, while engineers working in private industry without a direct offering of engineering services to the public or other businesses, education, and government need not be licensed &lt;ref&gt;https://engineers.texas.gov/downloads/lawrules.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. This has perpetuated the split between professional engineers and those in private industry.&lt;ref name = "Layton pp. 6-7"&gt;Layton (1986). pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; Professional societies have adopted generally uniform codes of ethics.

===Recent developments===
[[File:Citigroup center from ground.jpg|thumb|[[Citigroup Center#Engineering crisis of 1978|William LeMessurier's response]] to design deficiencies uncovered after construction of the Citigroup Center is often cited as an example of ethical conduct.]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ritual of the Calling of the Engineer Stamp 2000 Zoomed.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Canada Post stamp commemorating the 75th anniversary of [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]].

Efforts to promote ethical practice continue. In addition to the professional societies and chartering organizations efforts with their members, the Canadian [[Iron Ring]] and American [[Order of the Engineer]] trace their roots to the 1907 Quebec Bridge collapse. Both require members to swear an oath to uphold ethical practice and wear a symbolic ring as a reminder.

In the United States, the [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] released in 1946 its Canons of Ethics for Engineers and Rules of Professional Conduct, which evolved to the current Code of Ethics, adopted in 1964. These requests ultimately led to the creation of the Board of Ethical Review in 1954. Ethics cases rarely have easy answers, but the BER's nearly 500 advisory opinions have helped bring clarity to the ethical issues engineers face daily.&lt;ref name=BER&gt;{{cite web

Currently, bribery and political corruption is being addressed very directly by several professional societies and business groups around the world.&lt;ref name = "TI bribery"&gt;{{cite book | author = Transparency International and Social Accountability International |year = 2009 | title = Business Principles for Countering Bribery | url =http://www.transparency.org/whatwedo/pub/business_principles_for_countering_bribery| accessdate = 2013-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ASCE bribery"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Report Details Guidelines to Reduce Corruption in Engineering and Construction Industry |publisher=ASCE |date=2005-06-17 |url=http://www.asce.org/pressroom/news/display_press.cfm?uid=1794 |accessdate=2006-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165346/http://www.asce.org/pressroom/news/display_press.cfm?uid=1794 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new issues have arisen, such as [[offshoring]], [[sustainable development]], and environmental protection, that the profession is having to consider and address.

==General principles==
{{Rquote|right|Engineers, in the fulfillment of their professional duties, shall hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public|National Society of Professional Engineers|&lt;ref name="NSPE Paramount"/&gt;}}

{{Rquote|right|A practitioner shall, regard the practitioner's duty to public welfare as paramount."|Professional Engineers Ontario|&lt;ref name="PEO public good"/&gt;}}

Codes of engineering ethics identify a specific precedence with respect to the engineer's consideration for the [[society|public]], clients, employers, and the profession.

Many engineering professional societies have prepared codes of ethics. Some date to the early decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name = "Layton"/&gt; These have been incorporated to a greater or lesser degree into the regulatory laws of several jurisdictions.  While these statements of general principles served as a guide, engineers still require sound judgment to interpret how the code would apply to specific circumstances.

The general principles of the codes of ethics are largely similar across the various engineering societies and chartering authorities of the world,&lt;ref name="ICE canon"&gt;ICE (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; which further extend the code and publish specific guidance.&lt;ref name="ASCE Standards"&gt;ASCE (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The following is an example from the [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]:&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"&gt;ASCE [1914] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

#Engineers shall hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public and shall strive to comply with the principles of sustainable development in the performance of their professional duties.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall perform services only in areas of their competence.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall act in professional matters for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees, and shall avoid conflicts of interest.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall build their professional reputation on the merit of their services and shall not compete unfairly with others.
#Engineers shall act in such a manner as to uphold and enhance the honor, integrity, and dignity of the engineering profession and shall act with zero-tolerance for bribery, fraud, and corruption.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;
#Engineers shall continue their professional development throughout their careers, and shall provide opportunities for the professional development of those engineers under their supervision.&lt;ref name="ASCE canons"/&gt;

===Obligation to society===
The paramount value recognized by engineers is the safety and welfare of the public. As demonstrated by the following selected excerpts, this is the case for professional engineering organizations in nearly every jurisdiction and engineering discipline:

*'''[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]''': "We, the members of the IEEE, … do hereby commit ourselves to the highest ethical and professional conduct and agree: 1. to accept responsibility in making decisions consistent with the safety, health and welfare of the public, and to disclose promptly factors that might endanger the public or the environment;"&lt;ref name="IEEE Paramount"&gt;IEEE (2006).

*'''[[Institution of Civil Engineers]]''': "Members of the ICE should always be aware of their overriding responsibility to the public good.

'''Responsibility of engineers'''

The engineers recognize that the greatest merit is the work and exercise their profession committed to serving society, attending to the welfare and progress of the majority.
By transforming nature for the benefit of mankind, engineers must increase their awareness of the world as the abode of humanity, their interest in the universe as a guarantee of overcoming their spirit, and knowledge of reality to make the world fairer and happier.
The engineer should reject any paper that is intended to harm the general interest, thus avoiding a situation that might be hazardous or threatening to the environment, life, health, or other rights of human beings.
It is an inescapable duty of the engineer to uphold the prestige of the profession, to ensure its proper discharge, and to maintain a professional demeanor rooted in ability, honesty, fortitude, temperance, magnanimity, modesty, honesty, and justice; with the consciousness of individual well-being subordinate to the social good.
The engineers and their employers must ensure the continuous improvement of their knowledge, particularly of their profession, disseminate their knowledge, share their experience, provide opportunities for education and training of workers, provide recognition, moral and material support to the schools where they studied, thus returning the benefits and opportunities they and their employers have received.
It is the responsibility of the engineers to carry out their work efficiently and to support the law. In particular, they must ensure compliance with the standards of worker protection as provided by the law.
As professionals, the engineers are expected to commit themselves to high standards of conduct (NSPE). [1] 11/27/11

===Whistleblowing===
[[File:Challenger explosion.jpg|thumb|right|220px| The [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] is used as a case study of whistleblowing and [[organizational behavior]] including [[groupthink]].]]
{{main article|Whistleblower}}
A basic ethical dilemma is that an engineer has the duty to report to the appropriate authority a possible risk to others from a client or employer failing to follow the engineer's directions. According to first principles, this duty overrides the duty to a client and/or employer.&lt;ref&gt;Weil, [http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/EthicsResources/Otherresources/whistle.html "Whistleblowing:  What Have We Learned Since the Challenger?"]&lt;/ref&gt; An engineer may be disciplined, or have their license revoked, even if the failure to report such a danger does not result in the loss of life or health.&lt;ref&gt;See NSPE, Board of Ethical Review, Cases [http://www.niee.org/cases/78-88/case82-5.htm 82-5] and [http://www.niee.org/cases/78-88/case88-6.htm 88-6].&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, this duty can be discharged by advising the client of the consequences in a forthright matter, and ensuring the client takes the engineer's advice. In very rare cases, where even a governmental authority may not take appropriate action, the engineer can only discharge the duty by making the situation public.&lt;ref name="NSPE Whistleblowing"&gt;{{cite journal|author=NSPE |title=Final Report of the NSPE Task Force on Overruling Engineering Judgment to the NSPE Board of Directors |date=2006-06-30 |url=http://164.109.88.17/ethics/FINALReporttoNSPEBoard-June2006.pdf |accessdate=2008-02-20 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[whistleblowing]] by professional engineers is not an unusual event, and courts have often sided with engineers in such cases, overruling duties to employers and confidentiality considerations that otherwise would have prevented the engineer from speaking out.&lt;ref&gt;See the case of [[Shawn Carpenter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conduct===
There are several other ethical issues that engineers may face. Some have to do with technical practice, but many others have to do with broader considerations of business conduct. These include:&lt;ref name = "ASCE Standards" /&gt;
*Relationships with clients, consultants, competitors, and contractors
*Ensuring legal compliance by clients, client's contractors, and others
*[[Conflict of interest]]
*[[Bribery]] and [[kickbacks]], which also may include:
**Gifts, meals, services, and entertainment
*Treatment of [[trade secret|confidential]] or [[United States Economic and Protection of Proprietary Information Act|proprietary information]]
*Consideration of the employer’s assets
*Outside employment/activities ([[wikt:moonlight#Verb|Moonlighting]])

Some engineering societies are addressing [[environmental protection]] as a stand-alone question of ethics.&lt;ref name = "ASCE canons" /&gt;

The field of [[business ethics]] often overlaps and informs ethical decision making for engineers.

==Case studies and key individuals==
Petroski notes that most engineering failures are much more involved than simple technical mis-calculations and involve the failure of the design process or management culture.&lt;ref name = "Petroski"&gt;Petroski (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all engineering failures involve ethical issues. The infamous collapse of the first [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], and the losses of the [[Mars Polar Lander]] and [[Mars Climate Orbiter]] were technical and design process failures.

These episodes of engineering failure include ethical as well as technical issues.

'''Ernst Peter Wilhelm Troeltsch''' ({{IPA-de|tʁœltʃ|lang}}; 17 February 1865 – 1 February 1923) was a German [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] [[Protestant theologian]], writer on the [[philosophy of religion]] and the [[philosophy of history]], and a [[classical liberal]] politician. He was a member of the [[history of religions school]]. His work was a synthesis of a number of strands, drawing on [[Albrecht Ritschl]], [[Max Weber]]'s conception of [[sociology]], and the [[Baden school]] of [[Neo-Kantianism]].

His ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Church'' (''Die Soziallehren der christlichen Kirchen und Gruppen'', 1912)&lt;ref&gt;Two volume edition in translation by Harper Row, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; is a seminal work in theology.

==Life==
Troeltsch was born into a Lutheran family to a doctor but went to a Catholic school in a predominantly Catholic area before attending university at the [[University of Erlangen]] and then at the [[University of Göttingen]]. His ordination in 1889 was followed in 1891 by a post teaching theology at Göttingen. In 1892, he moved on to teach at the [[University of Bonn]]; in 1894, he moved on again to [[Heidelberg University]]. Finally, in 1915, he transferred to teach at what is now the [[University of Berlin]] where he took the title of professor of philosophy and civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of Christian Biography|editor=Michael Walsh|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0826452639|page=1108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theology==
Throughout Troeltsch's life, he wrote frequently of his belief that changes in society posed a threat to Christian religion, that "the disenchantment of the world" as described by sociologist [[Max Weber]] was under way. At an academic conference that took place in 1896, following a paper on the doctrine of ''[[Logos (Christianity)|logos]]'', Troeltsch responded by saying "Gentlemen, everything is tottering!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crisis in consciousness: The Thought of Ernst Troeltsch|author=Robert J. Rubanowice|publisher=University Presses of Florida|location=Tallahassee|page=9|year=1982|isbn=0813007216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Troeltsch sought to explain the decline of religion in the modern era through a description of the historical evolution of the role of religion in society. He described European civilisation as having three periods: [[Ancient history|ancient]], [[medieval]] and [[Modern history|modern]]. Troeltsch's understanding of the border between the medieval and modern periods is revisionary: instead of claiming that modernity starts with the rise of [[Protestantism]], Troeltsch argues that early Protestantism should be understood as a continuation of the medieval period. The modern period starts much later on his account, beginning only in the seventeenth century. The Renaissance in Italy and the scientific revolution planted the seeds for the arrival of the modern period, and Protestantism delayed rather than heralded its onset. Protestantism, Troeltsch argued, was "in the first place, simply a modification of Catholicism, in which the Catholic formulation of the problems was retained, while a different answer was given to them".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rubanowice, p. 21, from ''Protestantism and Progress'' (translated by W. Montgomery, 1958), p. 59. Original title: ''Die Bedeutung des Protestantismus für die Entstehung de modernen Welt''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Troeltsch saw this distinction between early and late (or "neo-") Protestantism as "the presupposition for any historical understanding of Protestantism".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Cite book|author=Toshimasa Yasukata|title=Ernst Troeltsch: Systematic Theologian of Radical Historicality|year=1986|isbn=1555400698|publisher=Scholars Press|location=Atlanta, Georgia|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography ==
Troeltsch developed three principles pertaining to critical [[historiography]]. Each of the principles served as a philosophical retort for the issue of the preconceived notions sustained by the historian. Troeltsch's three principles - the principle of criticism, the principle of analogy, and the principle of correlation - were determined to account for the issue surrounding the biases of the historian. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Historian and The Believer: The Morality of Historical Knowledge and Christian Faith|last=Harvey|first=Van Austin|publisher=Macmillan Company|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=13-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principle of criticism ===
Troeltsch's claim in this principle concludes that absolutes within history cannot exist. Troeltsch surmised that judgments about the past must be varied. In such, the absolute truth of historical reality could not exist, rather, he claimed historical situation could only be examined as more likely or less likely to have happened. In this, Troeltsch understood to never create a finite and non-revisable claim. 

=== Principle of analogy ===
This principle pertains to averting the historian from applying anachronism to the past. Troeltsch understands that the probability in the former principle can only be validated if a historians present situation, when assessing the probability, is not radically different from the past. In this, Troeltsch expects that human nature has been fairly constant throughout time, however this clause is still included as a form of accountability for the historian's narrative. 

=== Principle of correlation ===
In regards to a historical events, Troeltsch determined, through this principle, humanity's historical life is interdependent upon each individual. This understanding applies a casual nature to all events, equaling thus, an effect. Any radical event, the historian should assume, effected the historical nexus immediately surrounding that event. Troeltsch determines that in historical explanation it is important to include antecedents and consequences of events. This is in an effort to maintain historical events in their conditioned time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gesammelte Schriften II|last=Troeltsch|first=Ernst|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=729-753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Troeltsch was politically a [[classical liberal]] and served as a member of the Parliament of the [[Grand Duchy of Baden]]. In 1918, he joined the [[German Democratic Party]] (DDP). He strongly supported Germany's role in [[World War I]]: "Yesterday we took up arms. Listen to the [[ethos]] that resounds in the splendour of heroism: To your weapons, To your weapons!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/ernst-troeltsch-and-the-power-of-the-pen/a-17547502|title=Ernst Troeltsch and the power of the pen|publisher=DW.de|date=9 April 2014|author=Emma Wallis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In the immediate aftermath of Troeltsch's death, his work was considered passé and irrelevant. This was part of a wider rejection of [[Liberal Christianity|liberal]] thought with the rise of [[Neo-Orthodoxy]] in Protestant theology, especially with the prominence of [[Karl Barth]] in the German speaking world. From 1960 onwards though, Troeltsch's thought has seen a revival of interest in academic circles with a variety of books being published on Troeltsch's theological and sociological work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.religion-online.org/article/why-troeltsch-why-today-theology-for-the-21st-century/|title=Why Troeltsch?

'''Gait analysis''' is the systematic study of [[animal locomotion]], more specifically the study of human motion, using the eye and the brain of observers, augmented by [[instrumentation]] for measuring body movements, [[biomechanics|body mechanics]], and the activity of the muscles.&lt;ref&gt;Levine DF, Richards J, Whittle M. (2012). Whittle's Gait Analysis [https://www.amazon.com/Whittles-Gait-Analysis-David-Levine/dp/070204265X Whittle's Gait Analysis] Elsevier Health Sciences. {{ISBN|978-0702042652}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gait analysis is used to assess and treat individuals with conditions affecting their ability to walk. It is also commonly used in [[sports biomechanics]] to help athletes run more efficiently and to identify posture-related or movement-related problems in people with injuries.

The study encompasses [[Quantification (science)|quantification]] (i.e. introduction and analysis of measurable parameters of [[gait]]s), as well as interpretation, i.e. drawing various conclusions about the animal (health, age, size, weight, speed etc.) from its gait pattern.

==History==
The pioneers of scientific gait analysis were Aristotle in ''De Motu Animalium'' (On the Gait of Animals)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | author = Aristotle
 | title = On the Gait of Animals
 | publisher = Kessinger Publishing | year = 2004
 | isbn = 1-4191-3867-7
 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=lZGxiHM2ldIC
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and much later in 1680, [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]] also called ''De Motu Animalium (I et II)''. In the 1890s, the German anatomist [[Christian Wilhelm Braune]] and Otto Fischer published a series of papers on the biomechanics of human gait under loaded and unloaded conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Otto|last2=Braune|first2=Wilhelm|editor=|year=1895|title=Der Gang des Menschen: Versuche am unbelasteten und belasteten Menschen, Band 1.|publisher=Hirzel Verlag|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of [[photography]] and [[cinematography]], it became possible to capture image sequences that reveal details of human and animal locomotion that were not noticeable by watching the movement with the naked eye. [[Eadweard Muybridge]] and [[Étienne-Jules Marey]] were pioneers of these developments in the early 1900s. For example, serial photography first revealed the detailed sequence of the horse "[[Horse gait#Gallop|gallop]]", which was usually misrepresented in paintings made prior to this discovery.

Although much early research was done using [[movie camera|film cameras]], the widespread application of gait analysis to humans with pathological conditions such as [[cerebral palsy]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[neuromuscular disease|neuromuscular disorder]]s, began in the 1970s with the availability of [[video camera]] systems that could produce detailed studies of individual patients within realistic cost and time constraints. The development of treatment regimes, often involving [[orthopaedic surgery]], based on gait analysis results, advanced significantly in the 1980s. Many leading orthopaedic [[hospital]]s worldwide now have gait labs that are routinely used to design treatment plans and for follow-up monitoring.

Development of modern computer based systems occurred independently during the late 1970s and early 1980s in several hospital based research labs, some through collaborations with the aerospace industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sutherland DH | year = 2002 | title = The evolution of clinical gait analysis: Part II Kinematics | url = | journal = Gait &amp; Posture | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 159–179 | doi=10.1016/s0966-6362(02)00004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial development soon followed with the emergence of commercial television and later infrared camera systems in the mid-1980s.

==Process and equipment==
[[File:Proce.jpg|thumb|right|Acquisition of information on the position of the markers in 2D through the chambers of the left and right, this combination of information gives rise to a 3D image on the position of the markers]]
A typical gait analysis laboratory has several cameras (video or infrared) placed around a walkway or a treadmill, which are linked to a computer. The patient has markers located at various points of reference of the body (e.g., iliac spines of the pelvis, ankle malleolus, and the condyles of the knee), or groups of markers applied to half of the body segments. The patient walks down the catwalk or the treadmill and the computer calculates the trajectory of each marker in three dimensions. A model is applied to calculate the movement of the underlying bones. This gives a complete breakdown of the movement of each joint. One common method is to use Helen Hayes Hospital marker set,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kadaba|first1=M. P.|last2=Ramakrishnan|first2=H. K.|last3=Wootten|first3=M. E.|title=Measurement of lower extremity kinematics during level walking|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Research|date=May 1990|volume=8|issue=3|pages=383–392|doi=10.1002/jor.1100080310}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a total of 15 markers are attached on the lower body. The 15 marker motions are analyzed analytically, and it provides angular motion of each joint.

To calculate the kinetics of gait patterns, most labs have floor-mounted load transducers, also known as force platforms, which measure the ground reaction forces and moments, including the magnitude, direction and location (called the center of pressure). The spatial distribution of forces can be measured with [[pedobarography]] equipment. Adding this to the known dynamics of each body segment enables the solution of equations based on the Newton–Euler equations of motion permitting computations of the net forces and the net moments of force about each joint at every stage of the gait cycle. The computational method for this is known as inverse dynamics.

This use of kinetics, however, does not result in information for individual muscles but muscle groups, such as the extensor or flexors of the limb. To detect the activity and contribution of individual muscles to movement, it is necessary to investigate the electrical activity of muscles. Many labs also use surface electrodes attached to the skin to detect the electrical activity or electromyogram (EMG) of muscles. In this way it is possible to investigate the activation times of muscles and, to some degree, the magnitude of their activation—thereby assessing their contribution to gait. Deviations from normal kinematic, kinetic or EMG patterns are used to diagnose specific pathologies, predict the outcome of treatments, or determine the effectiveness of training programs

==Factors and parameters==
The gait analysis is modulated or modified by many factors, and changes in the normal gait pattern can be transient or permanent. The factors can be of various types:
*Extrinsic: such as terrain, footwear, clothing, cargo
*Intrinsic: sex (male or female), weight, height, age, etc.
*Physical: such as weight, height, physique
*Psychological: personality type, emotions
*Physiological: anthropometric characteristics, i.e., measurements and proportions of body
*Pathological: for example trauma, neurological diseases, musculoskeletal anomalies, psychiatric disorders

The parameters taken into account for the gait analysis are as follows:
*Step length
*Stride length
*Cadence
*Speed
*Dynamic Base
*Progression Line
*Foot Angle
*Hip Angle
*Squat Performance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schweitzer|first1=Eric|title=What is a gait analysis?|url=https://www.idealrun.com/gait-analysis/|website=IdealRun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Techniques ==

Gait analysis involves measurement,&lt;ref&gt;U. Tasch, P. Moubarak, W. Tang, L. Zhu, R.M. Lovering, J. Roche, R. J. Bloch. (2008). An Instrument that Simultaneously Measures Spatiotemporal Gait Parameters and Ground Reaction Forces in Locomoting Rats, in ''Proceeding of 9th Biennial ASME conference on Engineering Systems Design &amp; Analysis, ESDA ‘08.'' Haifa, Israel, pp. 45–49.&lt;/ref&gt; where measurable parameters are introduced and analyzed, and interpretation, where conclusions about the subject (health, age, size, weight, speed, etc.) are drawn. The analysis is the measurement of the following:

=== Temporal / spatial ===

It consists of the calculation of speed, the length of the rhythm, pitch, and so on. These measurements are carried out through:
* Stopwatch and marks on the ground.
* Walking on a pressure mat.
* Range laser sensors scanning a plane a few centimeters above the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piérard|first1=S.|last2=Azrour|first2=S.|last3=Phan-Ba|first3=R.|last4=Van Droogenbroeck|first4=M.|title=GAIMS: A reliable non-intrusive gait measuring system|journal=ERCIM News|date=October 2013|volume=95|pages=26–27|url=http://ercim-news.ercim.eu/en95/special/1359-gaims-a-reliable-non-intrusive-gait-measuring-system}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The GAIMS project|url=http://www.montefiore.ulg.ac.be/gaims}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inertial sensors and software to interpret 3D gyroscopes and 3D accelerometric data.

=== Kinematics ===
# [[Chronophotography]] is the most basic method for recording of movement. [[Strobe lighting]] at known frequency has been used in the past to aid in the analysis of gait on single photographic images.&lt;ref&gt;[[Étienne-Jules Marey]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Muybridge|Eadweard Muybridge]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Cine film]] or [[video]] recordings using footage from single or multiple cameras can be used to measure joint angles and velocities. This method has been aided by the development of analysis software that greatly simplifies the analysis process and allows for analysis in three dimensions rather than two dimensions only.
# Passive marker systems, using reflective markers (typically reflective balls), allows for accurate measurement of movements using multiple cameras (typically five to twelve cameras), simultaneously. The cameras utilize high-powered strobes (typically red, near infrared or infrared) with matching filters to record the reflection from the markers placed on the body. Markers are located at palpable anatomical landmarks. Based on the angle and time delay between the original and reflected signal, triangulation of the marker in space is possible. Software is used to create three dimensional trajectories from these markers that are subsequently given identification labels. A computer model is then used to compute joint angles from the relative marker positions of the labeled trajectories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis RB, Õunpuu S, Tyburski D, Gage JR | year = 1991 | title = A gait analysis data collection and reduction technique | url = | journal = Human Movement Science | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 575–587 | doi=10.1016/0167-9457(91)90046-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are also used for [[motion capture]] in the motion picture industry.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson DGE, et al. (2004). ''Research Methods in Biomechanics.'' Champaign IL:Human Kinetics Pubs..&lt;/ref&gt;
# Active marker systems are similar to the passive marker system but use "active" markers. These markers are triggered by the incoming infra red signal and respond by sending out a corresponding signal of their own. This signal is then used to triangulate the location of the marker. The advantage of this system over the passive one is that individual markers work at predefined frequencies and therefore, have their own "identity". This means that no post-processing of marker locations is required, however, the systems tend to be less forgiving for out-of-view markers than the passive systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Best|first=Russell|last2=Begg|first2=Rezaul |year=2006|publication-date=2006-03-30|chapter=Overview of Movement Analysis and Gait Features| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0yis6idPgy8C&amp;pg=PA11|editor-last=Begg|editor-first=Rezaul|editor2-last=Palaniswami|editor2-first=Marimuthu|title=Computational Intelligence for Movement Sciences: Neural Networks and Other Emerging Techniques|publisher=Idea Group|pages =11–18|isbn=978-1-59140-836-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Inertial (cameraless) systems based on [[MEMS]] inertial sensors, biomechanical models, and sensor fusion algorithms. These full-body or partial body systems can be used indoors and outdoors regardless of lighting conditions.

=== Markerless gait capture ===
* Markerless gait capture systems utilize one or more color cameras or 2.5D depth sensors (i.e. Kinect) to directly calculate the body joint positions from a sequence of images. The markerless system allows non-invasive human gait analysis in a natural environment without any marker attachment. Eliminating markers can expand the applicability of human gait measurement and analysis techniques, considerably reduce the preparation time, and enable efficient and accurate motion assessment in all kinds of applications. Currently, the main markerless system is the video-based motion capture with monocular camera or multiple camera studio.&lt;ref&gt;X. Zhang, M. Ding, G. Fan (2016) ''Video-based Human Walking Estimation by Using Joint Gait and Pose Manifolds'', IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the depth sensor-based gait analysis for clinical applications becomes more and more popular. Since depth sensors can measure the depth information and provide a 2.5D depth image, they have effectively simplified the task of foreground/background subtraction and significantly reduced pose ambiguities in monocular human pose estimation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/mengdingosu/home/research|title=Research - Meng Ding|website=sites.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pressure Measurement===
Pressure measurement systems are an additional way to measure gait by providing insights into pressure distribution, contact area, center of force movement and symmetry between sides. These systems typically provide more than just pressure information; additional information available from these systems are [[force]], timing and spatial parameters. Different methods for assessing pressure are available, like a pressure measurement mat or walkway (longer in length to capture more foot strikes), as well as in-shoe pressure measurement systems (where sensors are placed inside the shoe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gait Analysis with Pressure Measurement |url=https://www.tekscan.com/gait-analysis-systems |website=Tekscan |accessdate=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Coda |first1=A. |last2=Carline |first2=T. |last3=Santos |first3=D. |date=2014 |title=Repeatability and reproducibility of the Tekscan HR-Walkway system in healthy children |doi=10.1016/j.foot.2014.02.004 |pmid=24703061 |volume=24 |journal=Foot (Edinb) |pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many pressure measurement systems integrate with additional types of analysis systems, like motion capture, EMG or [[force platform|force plates]] to provide a comprehensive gait analysis.

===Kinetics===
Is the study of the forces involved in the production of movements.

===Dynamic electromyography===
Is the study of patterns of muscle activity during gait.

==Applications==
Gait analysis is used to analyze the walking ability of humans and animals, so this technology can be used for the following applications:

===Medical diagnostics===
'''Pathological gait''' may reflect compensations for underlying pathologies, or be responsible for causation of symptoms in itself. Cerebral palsy and stroke patients are commonly seen in gait labs. The study of gait allows diagnoses and intervention strategies to be made, as well as permitting future developments in [[rehabilitation engineering]].  Aside from clinical applications, gait analysis is used in professional [[sports]] training to optimize and improve athletic performance.

Gait analysis techniques allow for the assessment of gait disorders and the effects of corrective orthopedic surgery. Options for treatment of cerebral palsy include the artificial paralysis of spastic muscles using [[Botulin toxin|Botox]] or the lengthening, re-attachment or detachment of particular [[tendon]]s. Corrections of distorted bony anatomy are also undertaken ([[osteotomy]]).

===Chiropractic and osteopathic utilizations===
Observation of gait is also beneficial for diagnoses in [[chiropractic]] and [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic]]  professions as hindrances in gait may be indicative of a misaligned pelvis or sacrum. As the sacrum and ilium biomechanically move in opposition to each other, adhesions between the two of them via the [[sacrospinous ligament|sacrospinous]] or [[sacrotuberous ligaments]] (among others) may suggest a rotated pelvis. Both doctors of chiropractic and [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|osteopathic medicine]] use gait to discern the listing of a pelvis and can employ various techniques in order to restore a full range of motion to areas involved in ambulatory movement. Chiropractic adjustment of the pelvis has shown a trend in helping restore gait patterns&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herzog|first1=W|title=Quantifying the effects of spinal manipulations on gait using patients with low back pain.|journal=Journal of Manipulative and Physiological Therapeutics|date=1988|volume=11|issue=3|pages=151–157|pmid=2969026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=RO|first1=Robinson|last2=W|first2=Herzog|last3=BM|first3=Nigg|title=Use of force platform variables to quantify the effects of chiropractic manipulation on gait symmetry.|journal=Journal of manipulative and physiological therapeutics|date=1 August 1987|volume=10|issue=4|issn=0161-4754|pmid=2958572|pages=172–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MR|first1=Wells|last2=S|first2=Giantinoto|last3=D|first3=D'Agate|last4=RD|first4=Areman|last5=EA|first5=Fazzini|last6=D|first6=Dowling|last7=A|first7=Bosak|title=Standard osteopathic manipulative treatment acutely improves gait performance in patients with Parkinson's disease.|journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association|date=1 February 1999|volume=99|issue=2|doi=10.7556/jaoa.1999.99.2.92|issn=0098-6151|pmid=10079641|pages=92–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vismara|first1=Luca|last2=Cimolin|first2=Veronica|last3=Galli|first3=Manuela|last4=Grugni|first4=Graziano|last5=Ancillao|first5=Andrea|last6=Capodaglio|first6=Paolo|title=Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment improves gait pattern and posture in adult patients with Prader–Willi syndrome|journal=International Journal of Osteopathic Medicine|date=March 2016|volume=19|pages=35–43|doi=10.1016/j.ijosm.2015.09.001|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijosm.2015.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparative biomechanics===
By studying the gait of non-human animals, more insight can be gained about the mechanics of locomotion, which has diverse implications for understanding the biology of the species in question as well as locomotion more broadly.

'''Game studies''', or '''ludology''', is the study of games, the act of playing them, and the players and cultures surrounding them. It is a discipline of [[cultural studies]] that deals with all types of games throughout history. This field of research utilizes the tactics of, at least, [[anthropology]], [[sociology]] and [[psychology]], while examining aspects of the [[Game design|design of the game]], the players in the game, and finally, the role the game plays in its society or culture. Game studies is oftentimes confused with the study of [[video games]], but this is only one area of focus; in reality game studies encompasses all types of gaming, including [[sport]]s, [[board game]]s, etc.

Before video games, game studies often only included anthropological work, studying the games of past societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homo Ludens|last=Huizinga|first=Johan|publisher=Tjeenk Willink &amp; zoon|year=1938|isbn=|location=Haarlem|pages=|oclc=962401170}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once video games were introduced and became mainstream, game studies were updated to perform sociological and psychological observations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designtoolbox.co.uk/strategies/three-genres-of-game-research/ |title=Three Genres of Game Research |last=Mayer |first=Richard  |date=29 May 2016 |website=Design ToolBox |access-date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to observe the effects of gaming on an individual, his or her interactions with society, and the way it could impact the world around us.

There are three main approaches to game studies: the '''[[social science]]''' approach asks itself how games affect people and uses tools such as surveys and controlled lab experiments. The '''[[humanities]]''' approach asks itself what meanings are expressed through games, and uses tools such as ethnography and patient observation. The '''industrial and engineering''' approach applies mostly to video games and less to games in general, and examines things such as computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and networking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konzack|first=Lars|date=2007|editor-last=Williams|editor-first=J.

==History==

It wasn’t until [[Irving Finkel]] organized a colloquium in 1990 that grew into the [[International Board Game Studies Association]], [[Gonzalo Frasca]] popularized the term ''ludology'' (from the Latin word for game, ludus) in 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frasca|first=Gonzalo|date=1999|title=Ludology Meets Narratology: Similitude and Differences between (video)games and Narrative|url=http://www.ludology.org/articles/ludology.htm|journal=[[Parnasso]]|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the publication of the first issues of academic journals like ''Board Game Studies'' in 1998 and ''Game Studies'' in 2001, and the creation of the [[Digital Games Research Association]] in 2003, that scholars began to get the sense that the study of games could (and should) be considered a field in its own right. As a young field, it gathers scholars from different disciplines that had been broadly studying games, such as psychology, anthropology, economy, education, and sociology. The earliest known use of the term "ludology" occurred in 1982, in [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]]'s “Does Being Human Matter – On Some Interpretive Problems of Comparative Ludology.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jesperjuul.net/ludologist/2004/02/22/the-definitive-history-of-games-and-stories-ludology-and-narratology/|title=The definitive history of games and stories, ludology and narratology|last=Juul|first=Jesper|date=2004-02-22|work=The Ludologist|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social science==

One of the earliest social science theories (1971) about the role of video games in society involved [[violence]] in video games, later becoming known as the catharsis theory. The theory suggests that playing video games in which you perform violent acts might actually channel latent aggression, resulting in less aggression in the players real lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Television and Aggression; an Experimental Field Study|last=Feshbach|first=Seymour|last2=Singer|first2=Robert D.|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1971|isbn=|location=San Francisco|pages=|oclc=941871879}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a [[Meta-analysis|meta-study]] performed by Craig A. Anderson and Brad J. Bushman, in 2001, examined data starting from the 1980s up until the article was published.  The purpose of this study was to examine whether or not playing violent video games led to an increase in aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=C. A.|last2=Bushman|first2=B. J.|date=|year=2001|title=Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggressive Behavior, Aggressive Cognition, Aggressive Affect, Physiological Arousal, and Prosocial Behavior: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Scientific Literature|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-9280.00366|journal=Psychological Science|volume=12|issue=5|pages=353–59|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00366|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that exposure to violence in video games did indeed cause an increase in aggression. However, it has been pointed out, and even stressed, by psychologist Jonathan Freedman that this research was very limited and even problematic since overly strong claims were made and the authors themselves seemed extremely biased in their writings. More recent studies, such as the one performed by Christopher J. Ferguson at [[Texas A&amp;M International University]] have come to drastically different conclusions. In this study, individuals were either randomly assigned a game, or allowed to choose a game, in both the randomized and the choice conditions exposure to violent video games caused no difference in aggression. A later study (performed by the same people) looked for correlations between trait aggression, violent crimes, and exposure to both real life violence and violence in video games, this study suggests that while family violence and trait aggression are highly correlated with violent crime, exposure to video game violence was not a good predictor of violent crime, having little to no correlation, unless also paired with the above traits that had a much higher correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=Christopher J.|last2=Rueda|first2=Stephanie M.|last3=Cruz|first3=Amanda M.|last4=Ferguson|first4=Diana E.|last5=Fritz|first5=Stacey|last6=Smith|first6=Shawn M.|displayauthors=1|date=|year=2008|title=Violent Video Games and Aggression: Causal Relationship or Byproduct of Family Violence and Intrinsic Violence Motivation?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0093854807311719|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|volume=35|issue=3|pages=311–32|doi=10.1177/0093854807311719|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past 15 years, a large number of [[Meta-analysis|meta-studies]] have been applied to this issue, each coming to its own conclusion, resulting in little consensus in the ludology community. It is also thought that even nonviolent video games may lead to aggressive and violent behaviour. Anderson and Dill seem to believe that it may be due to the frustration of playing video games that could in turn result in violent, aggressive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=C.A.|last2=Dill|first2=K.E.|date=2000|title=Video games and aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviour in the laboratory and in life|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=4|pages=772–790|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.4.772|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game designers [[Amy Jo Kim]] and [[Jane McGonigal]] have suggested that platforms which leverage the powerful qualities of video games in non-game contexts can maximize learning.&lt;ref name="AmyJo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/amyjokim/smart-gamification|title=Smart Gamification|last=Kim|first=Amy Jo|date=1 August 2011|website=SlideShare|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reality is broken: Why games make us better and how they can change the world|last=McGonigal|first=Jane|publisher=Penguin|year=2011|isbn=9780099540281|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as the [[gamification of learning]], using game elements in non-game contexts extracts the properties of games from within the game context, and applies them to a learning context such as the classroom.

Another positive aspect of video games is its conducive character towards the involvement of a person in other cultural activities. The probability of game playing increases with the consumption of other cultural goods (e.g., listening to music or watching television) or active involvement in artistic activities (e.g., writing or visual arts production).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borowiecki|first=Karol J.|last2=Prieto-Rodriguez|first2=Juan|date=2015|title=Video Games Playing: A Substitute for Cultural Consumptions?|url=http://www.culturaleconomics.org/awp/AWP-07-2013.pdf|journal=Journal of Cultural Economics|volume=39|issue=3|pages=239–58.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games by being complementary towards more traditional forms of cultural consumption, inhibit thus value from a cultural perspective.

More sociologically-informed research has sought to move away from simplistic ideas of gaming as either 'negative' or 'positive', but rather seeking to understand its role and location in the complexities of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Video Gamers|last=Crawford|first=Garry|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415563680|location=London|pages=|author-link=Garry Crawford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, it has been suggested{{By whom|date=March 2018}} that the very popular MMO ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' could be used to study the dissemination of infectious diseases because of the [[Corrupted Blood|accidental spread]] of a [[Bubonic plague|plague]]-like disease in the gameworld.

=="Ludology" vs "Narratology"==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2013}}

A major focus in game studies is the debate surrounding [[narratology]] and ludology. Many ludologists believe that the two are unable to exist together,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesperjuul.net/thesis/|title=A clash between game and narrative|website=www.jesperjuul.net|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others believe that the two fields are similar but should be studied separately. Many narratologists believe that games should be looked at for their stories, like movies or novels. The ludological perspective says that games are not like these other mediums due to the fact that a player is actively taking part in the experience and should therefore be understood on their own terms. The idea that a videogame is "radically different to narratives as a [[cognitive]] and [[Communication|communicative]] structure"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aarseth|first1=Espen|date=|year=2001|title=Computer Game Studies, Year One|url=http://gamestudies.org/0101/editorial.html|journal=Game Studies|volume=1|issue=1|page=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has led the development of new approaches to criticism that are focused on videogames as well as adapting, repurposing and proposing new ways of studying and theorizing about videogames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konzack|first=Lars|date=2002|title=Computer Game Criticism: A Method for Computer Game Analysis|url=http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/05164.32231.pdf|journal=CGDC Conference Proceedings|volume=|pages=89–100|via=DiGRA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costikyan|first=Greg|date=2002|title=I Have No Words &amp; I Must Design: Toward a Critical Vocabulary for Games|url=http://www.digra.org/wp-content/uploads/digital-library/05164.51146.pdf|journal=CGDC Conference Proceedings|volume=|pages=9–34|via=DiGRA}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent approach towards game studies{{Which|date=March 2018}} starts with an analysis of interface structures and challenges the keyboard-mouse paradigm with what is called a "[[ludic interface]]".

Academics across both fields provide scholarly insight into the different sides of this debate. Gonzalo Frasca, a notable ludologist due to his many publications regarding game studies, argues that while games share many similar elements with narrative stories, that should not prevent games to be studied as games.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ludology.org/articles/ludology.htm|title=Ludology|website=www.ludology.org|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He seeks not "to replace the narratologic approach, but to complement it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Jesper Juul (game researcher)|Jesper Juul]], another notable ludologist, argues for a stricter separation of ludology and narratology. Juul argues that games "for all practicality ''can not'' tell stories."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This argument holds that narratology and ludology cannot exist together because they are inherently different. Juul claims that the most significant difference between the two is that in a narrative, events "have to" follow each other, whereas in a game the player has control over what happens.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Garry Crawford]] and Victoria K. Gosling argue in favor of narratives being an essential part of games as "it is impossible to isolate play from the social influences of everyday life, and in turn, play will have both intended and unintended consequences for the individual and society."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Garry|last2=Gosling|first2=Victoria K.|date=2009|title=More than a game: sports-themed video games and player narratives|url=|journal=Sociology of Sport Journal|volume=26|pages=50–66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Last of Us]]'' is a video game released in 2013 that has been referred to as a narrative "masterpiece."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/why-last-us-first-truly-mature-action-game-story/|title=Why The Last of Us is the first truly mature action game (and our Game of the Year)|work=gamesradar|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the narratology side of game studies argue that ''The Last of Us'' and similar games that have followed it and preceded it, serve as examples that games can in fact tell stories.

==Other areas of research==

As is common with most academic disciplines, there are a number of more specialized areas or sub-domains of study.

===Video game pre-history===
An emerging field of study looks at the "pre-history" of video games, suggesting that the origins of modern digital games lie in: [[fair]]ground attractions and [[sideshow]]s such as shooting games; early "[[Coney Island]]"-style pleasure parks with elements such as large [[roller-coaster]]s and "[[haunted house]]" simulations; nineteenth century landscape simulations such as [[diorama]]s, [[panorama]]s, [[planetarium]]s, and [[stereograph]]s; and [[amusement arcade]]s that had mechanical game machines and also [[peep-show]] film machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Virtual Art|last=Grau|first=Oliver|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0-262-57223-1|location=|pages=|author-link=Oliver Grau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Games and aging===
In light of [[population ageing]], there has been an interest into the use of games to improve the overall health and social connectedness of ageing players. For example, [[Adam Gazzaley]] and his team have designed [[NeuroRacer]] (a game that improves cognitive tasks outside of the game among its 60+ year old participants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazzaleylab.ucsf.edu/page74.html|title=NeuroRacer Study|author=Gazzaley|first=Adam|authorlink=Adam Gazzaley|date=4 September 2013|website=|publisher=Gazzaley Lab|location=[[University of California, San Francisco]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908124030/http://gazzaleylab.ucsf.edu/page74.html|archive-date=8 September 2013|accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while the [[AARP]] has organized a [[game jam]] to improve older people's social connections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miamioh.edu/news/campus-news/2016/03/aarp-game-jam.html|title=AARP teams up with students designing games for 50 plus|last=Kissell|first=Margo|date=17 March 2016|website=Miami University|publisher=|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers such as Sarah Mosberg Iversen have argued that most of the academic work on games and ageing has been informed by notions of economical productivity,{{Sfn|Iversen|2014|p=}} while [[Bob De Schutter]] and Vero Vanden Abeele have suggested a game design approach that is not focused on age-related decline but instead is rooted in the positive aspects of older age.{{Sfn|De Schutter|Vanden Abeele|2015|p=}}

===Virtual economies in gaming===
{{main|Virtual economy}}

Massive multiplayer online games can give economists clues about the real world. Markets based on digital information can be fully tracked as they are used by players, and thus real problems in the economy, such as inflation, deflation and even recession. The solutions the game designers come up with can therefore be studied with full information, and experiments can be performed where the economy can be studied as a whole. These games allow the economists to be omniscient, they can find every piece of information they need to study the economy, while in the real world they have to work with presumptions.

Former Finance Minister of Greece and Valve's in-house economist [[Yanis Varoufakis]] studied ''[[EVE Online]]'' and argued that video game communities give economists a venue for experimenting and simulating the economies of the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/09/28/the-economics-of-video-games/|title=The Economics of Video Games|last=Plumer|first=Brad|date=28 September 2012|website=The Washington Post|publisher=|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reason.com/archives/2014/05/07/a-multiplayer-game-environment|title='A Multiplayer Game Environment Is Actually a Dream Come True for an Economist'|last=Suderman|first=Peter|date=June 2014|website=Reason|publisher=|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Castronova has studied virtual economies within a variety of games including Everquest and World of Warcraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castronova|first=Edward|date=July 2002|title=On Virtual Economies|ssrn=338500|journal=CESifo Working Paper Series|language=|volume=752|pages=|via=SSRN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Synthetic worlds: the business and culture of online games|last=Edward.|first=Castronova,|date=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=9780226096278|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=58648183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive Benefits ===
The psychological research into games has yielded theories on how playing video games may be advantageous for both children and for adults. Some theories claim that video games in fact help improve cognitive abilities rather than impede their development. These improvement theories include the improvement of visual contrast sensitivity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/freedom-learn/201502/cognitive-benefits-playing-video-games|title=Cognitive Benefits of Playing Video Games|last=Gray|first=Peter|date=20 February 2015|website=Psychology Today|language=|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other developments include the ability to locate something specific among various impediments. This is primarily done in first-person shooter games where the protagonist must look at everything in a first person view while playing. By doing this they increase their spatial attention due to having to locate something among an area of diversions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These games place the player in a high intensity environment where the player must remain observant of their surroundings in order to achieve their goal, e.g., shooting an enemy player, while impediments obstruct their gameplay in the virtual world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another cognitive enhancement provided by playing video games would be the improvement of brain functioning speed. This happens as the player is immersed in an unendingly changing environment where they are required to constantly think and problem solve while playing in order to do well in the game. This constant problem solving forces the brain to constantly run and so the speed of thought is sharpened greatly, because the need to think quickly is required to succeed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The attention span of the player is also benefited. High action video games, such as fighting or racing games, require the user’s constant attention and in the process the skill of concentration is sharpened.

The overcoming of the condition known as dyslexia is also considered an improvement due to the continuous utilization of controllers for the video games. This continuous process helps to train the users to overcome their condition which impedes in their abilities of interpretation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ability of hand-eye coordination is also improved thanks in part to video games, due to the need to operate the controller and view the screen displaying the content all at the same time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The coordination of the player is enhanced due the playing and continuous observation of a video game since the game gives high mental stimulation and coordination is important and therefore enhanced due to the constant visual and physical movement that is produced from the playing of the video game.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The playing of video games can also help increase a player's social skills. This is done by playing online multiplayer games which can require constant communication, this leads to socialization between players in order to achieve the goal within the game they may be playing. In addition it can help the users to meet new friends over their online games and at the same time communicate with friends they have already made in the past; those playing together online would only strengthen their already established bond through constant cooperation. Some video games are specifically designed to aid in learning, because of this another benefit of playing video games could be the educational value provided with the entertainment. Some video games present problem solving questions that the player must think on in order to properly solve, while action orientated video games require strategy in order to successfully complete. This process of being forced to think critically helps to sharpen the mind of the player.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granic|first=Isabela|last2=Lobel|first2=Adam|last3=Engels|first3=Rutger C. M. E.|date=2014|title=The Benefits of Playing Video Games|url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/amp-a0034857.pdf|journal=American Psychologist|volume=69|issue=1|pages=66–78|doi=10.1037/a0034857|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Game Culture'''

One aspect of game studies is the study of gaming culture. People who play video games are a subculture of their own. Gamers will often form communities with their own languages, attend conventions where they will dress up as their favorite characters, and have gaming competitions.  One of these conventions, Gamescon 2017, had a record attendance with over 350,000 attendees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/gamescom-2017-worlds-biggest-video-game-convention-has-biggest-year-ever|title=Gamescom 2017: World's Biggest Video Game Convention Has Biggest Year Ever|last=Stewart|first=Sam|date=28 August 2017|website=IGN|language=|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Demographics of Gamers''' 
* 65% of households have a gamer.
* 67% own a console or gaming device.  
* 33 is the average age of male gamers. 
* 37 is the average age of female gamers. 
* 59% of gamers are men. 41% are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/!EF2017_Design_FinalDigital.pdf|title=2017 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry|last=|first=|date=April 2017|website=Entertainment Software Association|access-date=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], sexism or [[gender inequality]] denotes the inconsistencies between individuals due to gender. The topic covers a variety of concerns from [[education]] to equal opportunity in terms of employment and wages.

==Legislation==
In response to the concerns, the government has implemented various legislation, especially concerning gender discrimination, both institutional and personal, in the workplace; the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|Sex Discrimination Act of 1975]] protects individuals from being discriminated against in employment, vocational training, education, the provision and sale of goods, facilities and services, premises and the exercise of public functions due to their sex/gender; this was amended by the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]]. The [[Equal Pay Act 1970|Equal Pay Act of 1970]] mandates [[equal pay for equal work]] regardless of an individual's sex/gender, and the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 also protect the rights of individuals who intend to undergo, are undergoing, or have undergone [[gender reassignment|sex reassignment]]. These Regulations pertain to pay and treatment in employment, self-employment and vocational training.

The Equality Acts of [[Equality Act 2006|2006]] and [[Equality Act 2010|2010]] served to codify and combine all equality enactments within Great Britain, and provide comparable protections across all equality strands.

The [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC) is a non-departmental public body which has responsibility for the promotion and enforcement of equality and non-discrimination laws in England, Scotland and Wales, while the [[Government Equalities Office]] is a government department charged with promoting and improving gender equality within the UK government itself, responsible for leading the Discrimination Law Review, and providing advice on all other forms of equality to other UK government departments. The GEO was formerly known as the Women and Equality Unit.

===Culture===
It has increasingly been observed&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, in Kristina Nelson, ''Narcissism in High Fidelity'' (2004) p. 19 {{ISBN|0595318045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 =Genz | first1 = Stéphanie | last2 = Brabon | first2 = Benjamin A. | title = Postfeminism: Cultural Texts and Theories | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUGpvXJe9NAC|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press | isbn = 9780748635801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that a pervasive '[[lad culture]]' has developed in the U.K., described as an ironic, self-conscious method for young males to adopt "an [[anti-intellectual]] position, scorning sensitivity and caring in favour of drinking, violence, and a pre-feminist and racist attitude to women as both [[sex object]]s and creatures from another species".&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, in Kristina Nelson, ''Narcissism in High Fidelity'' (2004) p. 19 {{ISBN|0595318045}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|UN special rapporteur]] on violence against women similarly concluded that Britain has a "boys' club sexist culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/boys-club-britain-is-more-sexist-than-italy-azerbaijan-and-india-says-un-human-rights-expert-9262615.html |title=Boys' club Britain is more sexist than Italy, Azerbaijan and India, says UN human rights expert |last=Morrison |first=Sarah |date=5 December 2010 |work=The Independent |accessdate=16 April 2014 |place=London |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120905092306/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/wikileaks-hit-by-new-online-onslaught-2151570.html |archivedate=2012-09-05 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The culture has attracted wide criticism from feminist circles; [[Germaine Greer]] critiques it in her 2000 book ''The Whole Woman'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultures of Masculinity|author=Tim Edwards|pages=39–42|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-28480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Sociology: Feminist Perspectives|author1=Pamela Abbott |author2=Claire Wallace |author3=Melissa Tyler |year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-31258-2|page=354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson, C.|year=2006|title=Lads and Ladettes in School: Gender and a Fear of Failure|location=Maidenhead|publisher=Open University Press|isbn=0335225918}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Kira Cochrane]] asserts that "it's a dark world that ''Loaded'' and the lad culture has bequeathed us".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2007/08/lad-culture-cochrane-loaded Kira Cochrane, "The dark world of lads' mags"]. Newstatesman.com. Retrieved on 2012-12-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators believe that lad culture has affected politics and decreased the ability of women to participate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wilkinson, Helen|date=1998-08-07|title=The day I fell out of love with Blair|work=[[New Statesman]]|volume=127|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studies of industries such as the [[architecture]] profession found that lad culture had a negative impact on women completing their professional education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Gates, Charlie|date=2003-07-11|title=Lad culture forces women to quit: RIBA-funded study looks at reasons behind profession's high female drop-out rate|work=Building Design|volume=1587|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, British [[Feminism|feminist]] writer [[Laura Bates]] founded the [[Everyday Sexism Project]], a website and [[social media]] presence whose aim is to document everyday examples of [[sexism]] as reported by contributors; the submissions are then collated by a small group of volunteers led by Emer O'Toole, a researcher at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]]. By April 2013 the site had collected 25,000 entries from 15 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Laura. [https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2013/apr/16/everyday-sexism-project-shouting-back "The Everyday Sexism Project: a year of shouting back"], ''The Guardian'', 16 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
Various U.K. media institutions have been labelled problematic with regards to sexism and gender discrimination - most notably being the [[Page 3]] feature found in the British [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid]] newspaper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', which consists of a large photograph of a [[toplessness|topless]] female [[Glamour model#Glamour models|glamour model]] usually published on the newspaper's third page. In August 2012, the [[No More Page 3]] campaign emerged, sparking widespread discussion and receiving heavy support from [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]] MP [[Caroline Lucas]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=BBC|first=news|title=Caroline Lucas in Page Three T-shirt protest during debate|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22873790|accessdate=12 June 2013|newspaper=BBC news|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cross-party support from over [http://nomorepage3.org/letter-to-the-editor-signed-by-mps/ 140 other MPs].

A YouGov survey in October 2012 found differences in attitude toward Page 3 among readers of different newspapers; 61% of ''Sun'' readers wished to retain the feature, while 24 percent said that the newspaper should stop showing Page 3 women. However, only 4% of ''Guardian'' readers said ''The Sun'' should keep Page 3, while 86% said it should be abolished. The poll also found wide differences by gender, with 48% of men overall saying that Page 3 should be retained, but just 17% of women taking that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey Report |url= http://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/6jyst3v95o/YG-Archive-Pol-Sun-results-021012-Page-3-girls.pdf |work=YouGov / The Sun Survey Results|publisher=YouGov|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment===
{{Main|Gender pay gap}}
The U.K. has a persistent gender pay gap, the most significant factors associated with which are part-time work, education, the size of the firm a person is employed in, and occupational segregation (women are under-represented in managerial and high-paying professional occupations.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first= Victoria |last= Thomson |date= October 2006 |title= How Much of the Remaining Gender Pay Gap is the Result of Discrimination, and How Much is Due to Individual Choices? |journal= International Journal of Urban Labour and Leisure |volume= 7 |issue= 2 |url= http://www.ijull.co.uk/vol7/2/thomson.pdf |accessdate= September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When comparing full-time roles, men in the U.K. tend to work slightly longer hours than women in full-time employment. Depending on the age bracket and percentile of hours worked men in full-time employment work between 1.35% and 17.94% more hours than women in full-time employment.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, 2013 Provisional Results http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-328216&lt;/ref&gt; Even when taking the differences in hours worked into account, a pay gap still exists in the U.K., and typically increases with age and earnings percentile.&lt;ref&gt;A Look At The Gender Pay Gap By Age And Earning Power | http://www.octopus-hr.co.uk/hrmoz/article/the-gender-pay-gap-by-age-and-earning-power.aspx#sthash.IL6IGoYj.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Inequality in the context of education has greater implications in terms of future employment. Elements of the school curriculum still advocate certain gender-specific practices.

Boys lag behind girls at important educational milestones. At [[Key Stage 2]] girls outperform boys. The proportion of students achieving level 4 and above in reading, writing and maths, in 2015, in England, was 77% boys compared to 83% girls. The gap is wider for students who receive a free school meal. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CDP-2016-0207/CDP-2016-0207.pdf House of Commons Library International Men's Day Briefing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Girls outperform boys in headline [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] results. In state-funded schools, the gap in those achieving 5+ grades a*-C including English and maths is around 10 percentage points.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Young women are more likely to enrol at university. In 2016 the gender gap in favour of women was the highest on record. "In England, young women are 36% more likely to apply to university and when both sexes are from disadvantaged backgrounds young women are 58% more likely to apply."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ucas.com/corporate/news-and-key-documents/news/university-and-college-applicant-numbers-rise-02-ucas-reports|title=University and college applicant numbers rise by 0.2%, UCAS reports today|date=2016-02-03|newspaper=UCAS|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, [[sex education]] is not compulsory in the U.K.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=House of Lords votes against mandatory sex and relationship education in schools |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2014/01/28/house-of-lords-votes-against-mandatory-sex-and-relationship-education-in-schools/ |accessdate=17 April 2014 |newspaper=PinkNews |date=28 January 2014 |place=London |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[England and Wales]], the optional curriculum focuses mainly on biological areas such as the reproductive system, [[foetal development]], and the physical changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/legislation.htm Education Act 1996] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709095150/http://www.avert.org/legislation.htm |date=July 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussion about relationships and gender roles is often neglected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001201/120152e.pdf Britain: Sex Education Under Fire] UNESCO Courier;Jul/Aug2000, Vol. 53 Issue 7/8, pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Bates remarked that "better sex and relationships education in schools is desperately needed" to teach areas around "healthy relationships, [[Rape#Consent|consent]], respect and sexual abuse" in response to tackling everyday sexism earlier in life.

A '''genetically modified mouse''' (''Mus musculus'') is a [[house mouse|mouse]] that has had its [[genome]] altered through the use of [[genetic engineering]] techniques. Genetically modified mice are commonly used for research or as animal models of human diseases, and are also used for research on genes.

==History==

In 1974 [[Rudolf Jaenisch]] created the first genetically modified animal by inserting a DNA virus into an early-stage mouse [[embryo]] and showing that the inserted genes were present in every cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.71.4.1250|author1=Jaenisch, R.  |author2=Mintz, B.|year=1974|title=Simian virus 40 DNA sequences in DNA of healthy adult mice derived from preimplantation blastocysts injected with viral DNA.|journal=Proc.

In 1981 the laboratories of [[Frank Ruddle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kucherlapati|first=Raju|last2=Leinwand|first2=Leslie A.|date=2013|title=Frank Ruddle (1929–2013)|url=|journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]]|volume=92|issue=6|pages=839–840|doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.05.012|pmid=24242788|pmc=3675234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Yale University]], Frank Costantini and Elizabeth Lacy from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and Ralph Brinster and Richard Palmiter in collaboration from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[University of Washington]] injected purified DNA into a single-cell mouse embryo utilizing techniques developed by Brinster in the 1960s and 1970s, showing transmission of the genetic material to subsequent generations for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 1244–6| issue = 4526| year = 1981| pmid = 6272397| doi = 10.1126/science.6272397| volume = 214| journal = Science | first1 = J.| last2 = Ruddle | first2 = F.| title = Integration and stable germ line transmission of genes injected into mouse pronuclei| last1 = Gordon|bibcode = 1981Sci...214.1244G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 92–4| issue = 5836| year = 1981| pmid = 6945481| doi = 10.1038/294092a0| volume = 294| journal = Nature | first1 = F.| last2 = Lacy | first2 = E.| title = Introduction of a rabbit β-globin gene into the mouse germ line| last1 = Costantini|bibcode = 1981Natur.294...92C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brinster | first1 = R. | last2 = Chen | first2 = H.

==Methods==
There are two basic technical approaches to produce genetically modified mice. The first involves [[Microinjection#Pronuclear injection|pronuclear injection]] into a single cell of the mouse embryo, where it will randomly integrate into the mouse genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.77.12.7380|author=Gordon, J.W., Scangos, G.A, Plotkin, D.J., Barbosa, J.A. and Ruddle F.H.|year=1980|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|title=Genetic transformation of mouse embryos by microinjection of purified DNA|volume=77|issue=12|pages=7380–7384|pmid=6261253|pmc=350507|bibcode = 1980PNAS...77.7380G }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method creates a [[transgenic]] mouse and is used to insert new genetic information into the mouse genome or to over-express [[endogenous]] genes. The second approach, pioneered by [[Oliver Smithies]] and [[Mario Capecchi]], involves modifying [[embryonic stem cells]] with a [[DNA construct]] containing DNA sequences [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the target gene. Embryonic stem cells that [[Genetic recombination|recombine]] with the genomic DNA are selected for and they are then injected into the mice [[blastocysts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Thomas KR, Capecchi MR |year=1987|title=Site-directed mutagenesis by gene targeting in mouse embryo-derived stem cells|journal=Cell|pmid=2822260|volume=51|issue=3|pages=503–12|doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90646-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is used to manipulate a single gene, in most cases [[gene knockout|"knocking out"]] the target gene, although more subtle genetic manipulation can occur (e.g. only changing single [[nucleotides]]).

These systems are optimized for entertainment file sharing allowing libraries to be accessed across multiple servers from multiple rooms. They also integrate a range of content acquisition facilities including shared networking, built-in optical drives and tuners. These systems are operated from a simple TV-based menu. Individual servers feature secure volume managed expandable storage including internal, and external drives and arrays of drives into the multi-[[terabyte]] range.

'''''How Sex Works: Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel, and Act the Way We Do'''''' is a 2009 book by [[evolutionary biologist]] and ''[[New York Times]]'' [[Bestselling book|bestselling author]] [[Sharon Moalem]], published by [[HarperCollins]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web|last=Cruz|first=Gilbert|title=How Sex Works|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1895544,00.html|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah&gt;{{cite web|last=Winter|first=Jessica|title=Between the Covers|url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/How-Sex-Works-by-Sharon-Moalem-Book-Review|publisher=Oprah}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book examines the scientific reasons people are attracted to one another including the evolutionary underpinnings of [[sexual attraction]], [[monogamy]], and [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|title=EXCERPT: 'How Sex Works'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Books/story?id=7472408|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Lynn|title=Lynn Harris Reviews 'Behind the Bedroom Door,' 'How Sex Works,'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/21/AR2009072102755.html|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''How Sex Works'' uses [[evolutionary biology]] to explore human sexuality, and how sexuality can influence society in terms of human relations and belief systems. The author examines the physiological purpose behind how sensory data is interpreted by the human body and its effect on human sexuality.&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW SEX WORKS Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel, and Act the Way We Do|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/sharon-moalem/how-sex-works/|publisher=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moalem arguest that menstruation, fertility, penis size, orgasm, ejaculation and contraception all have traces back to the “[[survival of the fittest]]” and human's desire to find a healthy partner for reproduction.&lt;ref name=db&gt;{{cite web|title=The Daily Beast Recommends|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2009/04/28/the-daily-beast-recommends-7.html|publisher=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book covers other evolutionary factors influencing sexual attraction include pheremones, genetic makeup, immune system compatibility and ovulation.&lt;ref name=tbt&gt;{{cite web|last=A. Miller|first=Jen|title=Review: 'How Sex Works: Why We Look, Smell, Taste, Feel, and Act the Way We Do,' by Dr. Sharon Moalem|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/review-how-sex-works-why-we-look-smell-taste-feel-and-act-the-way-we-do/1003125|publisher=Tampa Bay Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book uses various examples to illustrate the author's central point, including:&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;ref name=oprah/&gt;
* Body scents are linked to strength of immune systems, signaling potential mates on the viability of producing healthy offspring
* Brazilian waxes have become more desirable as our subconscious attempts to eradicate pubic lice
* Men watching pornography with other men in the shot (along with a female) can lead to increased sperm production due to the perceived competition
* Women are more likely to fantasize about men who aren't their partners during ovulation, more likely to lead to fraternal twins
* Men are attracted to women with low waist-to-hip ratio (hourglass shape) because fatty acids stored in hip fat aid brain development in fetuses and lead to smarter children

[[Kirkus Reviews]] called the book "provocative and entertaining" describing it as "a volume stuffed with information that avoids getting bogged down in difficult medical terms or complex biological concepts."&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22251">{{short description|Low environmental oxygen levels}}
'''Hypoxia''' refers to low [[oxygen]] conditions. Normally, 20.9% of the gas in the atmosphere is oxygen. The [[partial pressure]] of oxygen in the atmosphere is 20.9% of the total barometric pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brandon|first=John|title=The Atmosphere, Pressure and Forces|url=http://www.pilotfriend.com/av_weather/meteo/atmos.htm|work=Meteorology|publisher=Pilot Friend|accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In water however, oxygen levels are much lower, approximately 1%, and fluctuate locally depending on the presence of photosynthetic organisms and relative distance to the surface (if there is more oxygen in the air, it will diffuse across the [[pressure gradient|partial pressure gradient]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dissolved Oxygen |url=http://www.waterontheweb.org/under/waterquality/oxygen.html |work=Water Quality |publisher=Water on the Web |accessdate=21 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213101908/http://www.waterontheweb.org/under/waterquality/oxygen.html |archivedate=13 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atmospheric hypoxia==

Atmospheric hypoxia occurs naturally at high [[altitude]]s. Total [[atmospheric pressure]] decreases as altitude increases, causing a lower partial pressure of oxygen which is defined as [[hypobaric]] hypoxia. Oxygen remains at 20.9% of the total gas mixture, differing from [[hypoxic hypoxia]], where the percentage of oxygen in the air (or blood) is decreased. This is common, for example, in the sealed burrows of some subterranean animals, such as [[blesmol]]s.&lt;ref name=Roper2001&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roper, T.J.| year = 2001 | title = Environmental conditions in burrows of two species of African mole-rat, ''Georychus capensis'' and ''Cryptomys damarensis'' | journal = Journal of Zoology | volume = 254 | issue = 1 | pages = 101–107 | doi = 10.1017/S0952836901000590|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atmospheric hypoxia is also the basis of [[altitude training]] which is a standard part of training for elite athletes. Several companies mimic hypoxia using normobaric [[artificial atmosphere]].

==Aquatic hypoxia==
'''Oxygen depletion''' is a phenomenon that occurs in aquatic environments as [[oxygen|dissolved oxygen]] ('''DO'''; molecular oxygen dissolved in the water) becomes reduced in concentration to a point where it becomes detrimental to aquatic organisms living in the system. Dissolved oxygen is typically expressed as a percentage of the oxygen that would dissolve in the water at the prevailing temperature and salinity (both of which affect the solubility of oxygen in water; see [[oxygen saturation]] and [[underwater]]). An aquatic system lacking dissolved oxygen (0% saturation) is termed anaerobic, [[Reducing environment|reducing]], or '''[[Anoxic waters|anoxic]]'''; a system with low concentration&amp;mdash;in the range between 1 and 30% saturation&amp;mdash;is called '''hypoxic''' or '''dysoxic'''. Most fish cannot live below 30% saturation. Hypoxia leads to impaired reproduction of remaining fish via [[endocrine disruptor|endocrine disruption]].&lt;ref&gt;Wu, R. et al. 2003. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231277909_Aquatic_Hypoxia_Is_an_Endocrine_Disruptor_and_Impairs_Fish_Reproduction Aquatic Hypoxia Is an Endocrine Disruptor and Impairs Fish Reproduction]&lt;/ref&gt; A "healthy" aquatic environment should seldom experience less than 80%. The '''exaerobic''' zone is found at the boundary of anoxic and hypoxic zones.

Hypoxia can occur throughout the water column and also at high altitudes as well as near sediments on the bottom. It usually extends throughout 20-50% of the water column, but depending on the water depth and location of pycnoclines (rapid changes in water density with depth). It can occur in 10-80% of the water column. For example, in a 10-meter water column, it can reach up to 2 meters below the surface. In a 20-meter water column, it can extend up to 8 meters below the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Rabalais, Nancy; Turner, R. Eugene; Justic´, Dubravko; Dortch, Quay; Wiseman, William J. Jr. Characterization of Hypoxia: Topic 1 Report for the Integrated Assessment on Hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Ch. 3. NOAA Coastal Ocean Program, Decision Analysis Series No. 15.

===Causes of hypoxia ===
[[File:Decline of oxygen saturation to anoxia at night Kiel Fjord Germany.png|thumb|250px|left|Decline of oxygen saturation to anoxia, measured during the night in [[Kiel Fjord]], Germany. Depth = 5 m]]
Oxygen depletion can result from a number of natural factors, but is most often a concern as a consequence of [[pollution]] and [[eutrophication]] in which [[Nutrients#Nutrients and the environment|plant nutrients]] enter a river, lake, or ocean, and [[phytoplankton]] blooms are encouraged. While phytoplankton, through [[photosynthesis]], will raise DO saturation during daylight hours, the dense population of a [[Algal bloom|bloom]] reduces DO saturation during the night by [[cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|respiration]]. When phytoplankton cells die, they sink towards the bottom and are decomposed by [[bacterium|bacteria]], a process that further reduces DO in the water column. If oxygen depletion progresses to hypoxia, [[fish kill]]s can occur and invertebrates like [[worm]]s and [[clam]]s on the bottom may be killed as well.
[[Image:Fishkillk.jpg|thumb|left|Still frame from an underwater video of the sea floor. The floor is covered with crabs, fish, and clams apparently dead or dying from oxygen depletion.]]

Hypoxia may also occur in the absence of pollutants. In estuaries, for example, because freshwater flowing from a river into the sea is less dense than salt water, stratification in the water column can result. Vertical mixing between the water bodies is therefore reduced, restricting the supply of oxygen from the surface waters to the more saline bottom waters. The oxygen concentration in the bottom layer may then become low enough for hypoxia to occur. Areas particularly prone to this include shallow waters of semi-enclosed water bodies such as the [[Waddenzee]] or the [[Gulf of Mexico]], where land run-off is substantial. In these areas a so-called "[[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]" can be created. Low dissolved oxygen conditions are often seasonal, as is the case in [[Hood Canal]] and areas of [[Puget Sound]], in Washington State.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Puget Sound: Hypoxia http://www.eopugetsound.org/science-review/section-4-dissolved-oxygen-hypoxia&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Resources Institute]] has identified 375 hypoxic coastal zones around the world, concentrated in coastal areas in Western Europe, the Eastern and Southern coasts of the US, and East Asia, particularly in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Jubilee-Mobile-Bay-Alabama-crabs-flounders.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Mobile Bay jubilee|Jubilee]] photo from [[Mobile Bay]]]] Hypoxia may also be the explanation for periodic phenomena such as the [[Mobile Bay jubilee]], where aquatic life suddenly rushes to the shallows, perhaps trying to escape oxygen-depleted water. Recent widespread shellfish kills near the coasts of Oregon and Washington are also blamed on cyclic [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]] ecology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/newsarch/2006/Aug06/dieoff.html oregonstate.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901192135/http://oregonstate.edu/dept/ncs/newsarch/2006/Aug06/dieoff.html |date=2006-09-01 }} &amp;ndash; Dead Zone Causing a Wave of Death Off Oregon Coast (8/9/2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phytoplankton breakdown ====
Scientists have determined that high concentrations of minerals dumped into bodies of water causes significant growth of phytoplankton blooms. As these blooms are broken down by bacteria, such as ''Phanerochaete chrysosprium'', oxygen is depleted by the enzymes of these organisms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gubernatorova|first=T. N.|last2=Dolgonosov|first2=B. M.|date=2010-05-01|title=Modeling the biodegradation of multicomponent organic matter in an aquatic environment: 3. Analysis of lignin degradation mechanisms|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S0097807810030085|journal=Water Resources|language=en|volume=37|issue=3|pages=332–346|doi=10.1134/S0097807810030085|issn=0097-8078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Breakdown of lignin =====
[[File:Tetrapyrrol ring.png|left|thumb|234x234px|Tetrapyrrol ring, the active site of Ligninperoxidase enzyme]]
Phytoplankton are mostly made up of lignin and cellulose, which are broken down by enzymes present in organisms such as ''P. chrysosprium'', known as white-rot''.'' However, the breakdown of cellulose does not deplete oxygen concentration in water, whereas breakdown of lignin does. This breakdown of lignin includes an oxidative mechanism, and requires the presence of dissolved oxygen to take place by enzymes like ligninperoxidase. Other fungi such as brown-rot, soft-rot, and blue stain fungi also are necessary in lignin transformation. As this oxidation takes place, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is formed in its place&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Active site of tetrapyrrol ring binding oxygen.png|thumb|392x392px|Active site of tetrapyrrol ring binding oxygen]]
[[File:Oxyferroheme is converted to Ferri-LiP with the addition of veratric alcohol, and gives off diatomic oxygen radical..png|thumb|392x392px|Oxyferroheme is converted to Ferri-LiP with the addition of veratric alcohol, and gives off diatomic oxygen radical.]]
[[File:Breakdown of coniferyl alcohol.png|thumb|393x393px|This is the breakdown of a confieryl alcohol by a hydrogen ion to make propanol and ortho-methoxyphenol.]]
Ligninperoxidase (LiP) serves as the most import enzyme because it is best at breaking down lignin in these organisms. LiP disrupts C-C bonds and C-O bonds within Lignin’s three-dimensional structure, causing it to break down. LiP consists of ten alpha helices, two Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; structural ions, as well as a heme group called a tetrapyrrol ring. Oxygen serves an important role in the catalytic cycle of LiP to form a double bond on the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion in the tetrapyrrol ring. Without the presence of diatomic oxygen in the water, this breakdown cannot take place because Ferrin-LiP will not be reduced into Oxyferroheme. Oxygen gas is used to reduce Ferrin-LiP into Oxyferroheme-LiP. Oxyferroheme and veratric alcohol combine to create oxygen radical and Ferri-LiP, which can now be used to degrade lignin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Oxygen radicals cannot be used in the environment, and are harmful in high presence in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Betteridge|first=D. John|title=What is oxidative stress?|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0026-0495(00)80077-3|journal=Metabolism|volume=49|issue=2|pages=3–8|doi=10.1016/s0026-0495(00)80077-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Ferri-LiP is present in the ligninperoxidase, it can be used to break down lignin molecules by removing one phenylpropane group at a time through either the LRET mechanism or the mediator mechanism. The LRET mechanism (long range electron transfer mechanism) transfers an electron from the tetrapyrrol ring onto a molecule of phenylpropane in a lignin. This electron moves onto a C-C or C-O bond to break one phenylpropane molecule from the lignin, breaking it down by removing one phenylpropane at a time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the mediator mechanism, LiP enzyme is activated by the addition of hydrogen peroxide to make LiP radical, and a mediator such as veratric alcohol is added and activated creating veratric alcohol radical. Veratric alcohol radical transfers one electron to activate the phenylpropane on lignin, and the electron dismantles a C-C or C-O bond to release one phenylpropane from the lignin. As the size of a lignin molecule increases, the more difficult it is to break these C-C or C-O bonds.

LiP has a very low MolDock score, meaning there is little energy required to form this enzyme and stabilize it to carry out reactions. LiP has a MolDock score of -156.03 kcal/mol. This is energetically favorable due to its negative free energy requirements, and therefore this reaction catalyzed by LiP is likely to take place spontaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Ming|last2=Zeng|first2=Guangming|last3=Tan|first3=Zhongyang|last4=Jiang|first4=Min|last5=Li|first5=Hui|last6=Liu|first6=Lifeng|last7=Zhu|first7=Yi|last8=Yu|first8=Zhen|last9=Wei|first9=Zhen|date=2011-09-29|title=Understanding Lignin-Degrading Reactions of Ligninolytic Enzymes: Binding Affinity and Interactional Profile|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0025647|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=9|pages=e25647|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0025647|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breakdown of propanol and phenols occur naturally in the environment because they are both water soluble.

===== Environmental factors =====
The breakdown of phytoplankton in the environment depends on the presence of oxygen, and once oxygen is no longer in the bodies of water, ligninperoxidases cannot continue to break down the lignin. When oxygen is not present in the water, the breakdown of phytoplankton changes from 10.7 days to a total of 160 days for this to take place.

The rate of phytoplankton breakdown can be represented using this equation:

&lt;math&gt;G(t) = G(0)e^{-kt}&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, G(t) is the amount of particulate organic carbon (POC) overall at a given time, t. G(0) is the concentration of POC before breakdown takes place. k is a rate constant in year-1, and t is time in years. For most POC of phytoplankton, the k is around 12.8 years-1, or about 28 days for nearly 96% of carbon to be broken down in these systems. Whereas for anoxic systems, POC breakdown takes 125 days, over four times longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harvey|first=H. Rodger|date=|title=Kinetics of phytoplankton decay during simulated sedimentation: Changes in biochemical composition and microbial activity under oxic and anoxic conditions|url=|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume=59|pages=3367–3377|via=|doi=10.1016/0016-7037(95)00217-n}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes approximately 1&amp;nbsp;mg of Oxygen to break down 1&amp;nbsp;mg of POC in the environment, and therefore, hypoxia takes place quickly as oxygen is used up quickly to digest POC. About 9% of POC in phytoplankton can be broken down in a single day at 18&amp;nbsp;°C, therefore it takes about eleven days to completely break down a full phytoplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jewell|first=William J.|date=|title=Aquatic Weed Decay: Dissolved Oxygen Utilization and Nitrogen and Phosphorus Regeneration|url=|journal=ournal (Water Pollution Control Federation)|volume=43|pages=1457–1467|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After POC is broken down, this particulate matter can be turned into other dissolved organic carbon, such as carbon dioxide, bicarbonate ions, and carbonate. As much as 30% of phytoplankton can be broken down into dissolved organic carbon. When this particulate organic carbon interacts with 350&amp;nbsp;nm ultraviolet light, dissolved organic carbon is formed, removing even more oxygen from the environment in the forms of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate ions, and carbonate. Dissolved inorganic carbon is made at a rate of 2.3-6.5&amp;nbsp;mg/(m^3)day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johannessen|first=Sophia C.|last2=Peña|first2=M.

As phytoplankton breakdown, free phosphorus and nitrogen become available in the environment, which also fosters hypoxic conditions. As the breakdown of these phytoplankton takes place, the more phosphorus turns into phosphates, and nitrogens turn into nitrates. This depletes the oxygen even more so in the environment, further creating hypoxic zones in higher quantities. As more minerals such as phosphorus and nitrogen are displaced into these aquatic systems, the growth of phytoplankton greatly increases, and after their death, hypoxic zones are formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conley|first=Daniel J.|last2=Paerl|first2=Hans W.|last3=Howarth|first3=Robert W.|last4=Boesch|first4=Donald F.|last5=Seitzinger|first5=Sybil P.|last6=Havens|first6=Karl E.|last7=Lancelot|first7=Christiane|last8=Likens|first8=Gene E.|date=2009-02-20|title=Controlling Eutrophication: Nitrogen and Phosphorus|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5917/1014|journal=Science|language=en|volume=323|issue=5917|pages=1014–1015|doi=10.1126/science.1167755|issn=0036-8075|pmid=19229022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solutions ===
To combat hypoxia, it is essential to reduce the amount of land-derived nutrients reaching rivers in runoff. This can be done by improving sewage treatment and by reducing the amount of fertilizers leaching into the rivers. Alternately, this can be done by restoring natural environments along a river; marshes are particularly effective in reducing the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen (nutrients) in water. Other natural habitat-based solutions include restoration of shellfish populations, such as oysters. [[Oyster]] reefs remove [[nitrogen]] from the water column and filter out suspended solids, subsequently reducing the likelihood or extent of [[harmful algal blooms]] or anoxic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Timm (2012) [http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/oyster-restoration-study-kroeger.pdf Dollars and Sense: Economic Benefits and Impacts from two Oyster Reef Restoration Projects in the Northern Gulf of Mexico].

[[Image:Anoxie allemagne2.png|thumb|250px|Graphs of oxygen and salinity levels at Kiel Fjord in September 1998.]]
Technological solutions are also possible, such as that used in the redeveloped [[Salford Docks]] area of the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] in England, where years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters. In 2001 a compressed air injection system was introduced, which raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%. The resulting improvement in water quality led to an increase in the number of invertebrate species, such as freshwater [[shrimp]], to more than 30. [[spawn (biology)|Spawning]] and growth rates of fish species such as [[Rutilus|roach]] and [[perch]] also increased to such an extent that they are now amongst the highest in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mangeogsoc.org.uk/egm/5_1.pdf|accessdate=2007-12-11|date=2003-08-21|format=pdf|title= Exploring Greater Manchester&amp;nbsp;— a fieldwork guide: The fluvioglacial gravel ridges of Salford and flooding on the River Irwell|author= Hindle, P.(1998)|publisher=Manchester Geographical Society}} p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In a very short time the [[oxygen saturation]] can drop to zero when offshore blowing winds drive surface water out and anoxic depth water rises up. At the same time a decline in temperature and a rise in salinity is observed (from the longterm ecological observatory in the [[sea]]s at Kiel Fjord, Germany). New approaches of long-term monitoring of oxygen regime in the ocean observe online the [[behavior]] of [[fish]] and [[zooplankton]], which changes drastically under reduced [[oxygen saturation]]s ([[ecoSCOPE]]) and already at very low levels of [[water pollution]].

The '''Indian Institute of Astrophysics''' (IIA), with its headquarters in [[Bangalore]] ([[Karnataka]] state), is a premier National Research Institute of [[India]]. IIA conducts research primarily in the areas of [[astronomy]], [[astrophysics]] and related subjects. It is widely recognised as a leading research center for Astrophysics in India.

The institute has a network of laboratories and observatories in India, including [[Kodaikanal]] (the [[Kodaikanal Solar Observatory]]), [[Kavalur]] (the [[Vainu Bappu Observatory]]), [[Gauribidanur]], [[Hanle (village)|Hanle]] (the [[Indian Astronomical Observatory]]) and [[Hosakote]].

IIA contributed to [[Astrosat]], India's first dedicated multi-wavelength space observatory. The Astrosat project is a collaborative effort of many different research institutions from India. 

==Areas of research==
Researchers at IIA work on a diverse set of topics related to Astronomy and Astrophysics. However, the research can be broadly classified under the following areas:
* Sun &amp; Solar system
* [[Stellar Astronomy]]
* [[Galactic Astronomy]]
* [[Extragalactic Astronomy]] &amp; [[Cosmology]]
* Theoretical Astrophysics &amp; Physics
* Techniques &amp; Instrumentation
* Space Astronomy

==History==
The origin of Indian studies in astronomy can be traced to a private observatory established by [[William Petrie]] (died: 1816), an officer of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]]. He set up that private observatory in his residence located in [[Egmore]], Chennai (formerly [[Madras]]), India. The main aim of the observatory, according to Petrie, was 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"to provide navigational assistance to the company ships and help determine the longitudes by observing the eclipses of Moon and satellites of Jupiter".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1790, this private observatory was taken over by the East India Company, with [[Michael Topping]] (1747–96) as an astronomer. In 1792, the observatory was expanded and shifted to a complex in [[Nungambakkam]] area of Chennai. This was the first modern observatory outside [[Europe]].

Presently, the Indian Institute of Astrophysics functions under the control of the Department of Science and Technology, [[Government of India]].


==Academics ==
The Institute awards three types of degrees.

* Ph.D.:
* Integrated M.Sc./Ph.D.
* Integrated M.Tech.-Ph.D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4458">The '''Leaf Angle Distribution''' (or LAD) of a plant canopy refers to the mathematical description of the angular [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of the [[Leaf|leaves]] in the [[vegetation]]. Specifically, if each leaf is conceptually represented by a small flat plate, its orientation can be described with the [[zenith]] and the [[azimuth]] angles of the [[surface normal]] to that plate. If the leaf has a complex structure and is not flat, it may be necessary to approximate the actual leaf by a set of small plates, in which case there may be a number of leaf normals and associated angles. The LAD describes the statistical distribution of these angles.

==Examples of Leaf Angle Distributions==

Different plant canopies exhibit different LADs: For instance, grasses and willows have their leaves largely hanging vertically (such plants are said to have an erectophile LAD), while oaks tend to maintain their leaves more or less horizontally (these species are known as having a planophile LAD). In some tree species, leaves near the top of the [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] follow an erectophile LAD while those at the bottom of the canopy are more planophile. This may be interpreted as a strategy by that plant species to maximize exposure to light, an important constraint to growth and development. Yet other species (notably [[sunflower]]) are capable of reorienting their leaves throughout the day to optimize exposure to the Sun: this is known as [[heliotropism]].

==Importance of LAD==

The LAD of a plant canopy has a significant impact on the [[Reflection (physics)|reflectance]], [[transmittance]] and [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of solar light in the vegetation layer, and thus also on its growth and development. LAD can also serve as a quantitative index to monitor the state of the plants, as [[wilting]] usually results in more erectophile LADs. [[Scientific modelling|Models]] of [[radiation]] transfer need to take this distribution into account to predict, for instance, the [[albedo]] or the productivity of the canopy.

==Measuring LAD==

Accurately measuring the statistical properties of leaf angle distributions is not a trivial matter, especially for small leaves. [[Clinometer]]s can be used but may be rather bulky or inconvenient. Most leaves are quite light and tend to move with the slightest [[Wind|breeze]] or air [[turbulence]]. Nevertheless, when these environmental conditions are suitable or can be controlled, it is possible to acquire data on leaf orientation.

This may be done, for instance, with a Spatial Coordinate Apparatus, which is an articulated mechanical device capable or recording the position in three-dimensional space of three separate points forming a small triangle. The orientation of the triangle is computed from these coordinates.

Yet another approach is to use a [[3D_scanner|laser scanner]]: this instrument can record the angular and distance coordinates of the intersection of a laser beam with objects within its range. The LAD of canopy leaves can be derived from such measurements.

Extensive data sets of LAD have been recorded, especially during intensive field campaigns, such as the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) or the SAFARI 2000 field campaign. See the external links below for getting access to these data.

==LAD functions==

In general, LAD are modelled with one- or two-parameters functions including ellipsoidal, rotated-ellipsoidal and Beta functions. Comparison between different LAD functions with in-situ measurements show that, two-parameter functions (especially Beta function) may perform better than one-parameter functions.

''Work Systems: The Methods, Measurement &amp; Management of Work'', Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|978-0-13-140650-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[chart]] is very effective method to analyze the work done by a single worker and it is very helpful in improving the work done by the worker.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3903">In 1997 a core set of six principles was established by ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]] for the sustainability governance of the oceans. These six principles became known as the "'''Lisbon Principles'''": together they provide basic guidelines for administering the use of common natural and social resources.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. et al. 2007. ''Lisbon principles of sustainable governance''. In: Encyclopaedia of Earth. Ed. C. J. Cleveland. Environmental Information Coalition, National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington D.C. Published in Encyclopaedia of the Earth August 9, 2007; retrieved February 6, 2009.[http://eoearth.org/article/Lisbon_principles_of_sustainable_governance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129134940/http://eoearth.org/article/Lisbon_principles_of_sustainable_governance |date=January 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R.  et al. 1998. Principles for sustainable governance of the oceans. ''Science'' '''281''': 198-199. (also ''Nature'' '''387''':  253-260 (1997) see above.)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Principle 1: '''Responsibility'''. ''Access to environmental resources carries attendant responsibilities to use them in an ecologically sustainable, economically efficient, and socially fair manner. Individual and corporate responsibilities and incentives should be aligned with each other and with broad social and ecological goals.''
*Principle 2: '''Scale-matching'''. ''Ecological problems are rarely confined to a single scale. Decision-making on environmental resources should (i) be assigned to institutional levels that maximize ecological input, (ii) ensure the flow of ecological information between institutional levels, (iii) take ownership and actors into account, and (iv) internalize costs and benefits. Appropriate scales of governance will be those that have the most relevant information, can respond quickly and efficiently, and are able to integrate across scale boundaries.''
*Principle 3: '''Precaution'''. ''In the face of uncertainty about potentially irreversible environmental impacts, decisions concerning their use should err on the side of caution. The burden of proof should shift to those whose activities potentially damage the environment.''
*Principle 4: '''[[Adaptive management]]'''. ''Given that some level of uncertainty always exists in environmental resource management, decision-makers should continuously gather and integrate appropriate ecological, social, and economic information with the goal of adaptive improvement.''
*Principle 5: '''[[Environmental full-cost accounting|Full cost]] allocation'''. ''All of the internal and external costs and benefits, including social and ecological, of alternative decisions concerning the use of environmental resources should be identified and allocated. When appropriate, markets should be adjusted to reflect full costs.''
*Principle 6: '''Participation'''. ''All stakeholders should be engaged in the formulation and implementation of decisions concerning environmental resources. Full stakeholder awareness and participation contributes to credible, accepted rules that identify and assign the corresponding responsibilities appropriately.''

The [[ecclesiastical]] words most commonly [[abbreviate]]d at all times are [[proper name]]s, [[title]]s (official or customary), of persons or [[corporation]]s, and words of frequent occurrence. A list of those used in [[Roman Republic]]an and early [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] times may be seen in [[James Chidester Egbert, Jr.]]'s ''[[Latin Inscriptions]]'' ([[New York City]], 1896), 417–459.

The [[Jewish]] scribes and [[Talmudic]] scholars also had frequent recourse to abbreviations. Between the seventh and ninth centuries the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] system of abbreviations gave way to a more difficult one that gradually grew up in the monastic houses and in the chanceries of the new [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] kingdoms. [[Merovingian]], [[Lombardic language|Lombard]], and [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] scripts offer each their own abbreviations, not to speak of the unique scotica manus or libri scottice scripti ([[Irish language|Irish]] hand, or books written in the medieval Irish hand). Eventually such productive centres of technical manuscripts as the [[Papal Chancery]], the theological schools of [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]], and the civil-law school of [[Bologna]] set the standards of abbreviations for all [[Europe]].

Medieval manuscripts abound in abbreviations, owing in part to the abandonment of the [[uncial]], or [[quasi]]-uncial, and the almost universal use of the cursive, hand. The medieval writer inherited a few from [[Christian]] antiquity; others he invented or adapted, in order to save time and parchment. They are found especially in manuscripts of scholastic theology and canon law, annals and chronicles, the Roman law, and in administrative documents, civil and privileges, bulls, rescripts. They multiplied with time, and were never so numerous as on the eve of the discovery of printing; many of the early printed books offer this peculiarity, together with other characteristics of the manuscript page.

The development of printing brought about the abandonment of many abbreviations, while it suggested and introduced new ones a process also favoured by the growth of ecclesiastical legislation, the creation of new offices, etc. There was less medieval abbreviation in the text of books much used on public occasions, e.g. missals, antiphonaries, Bibles; in one way or another the needs of students seem to have been the chief cause of the majority of medieval abbreviations. The means of abbreviation were usually full points or dots (mostly in Roman antiquity), the semicolon (eventually conventionalized), lines (horizontal, perpendicular, oblong, wavy curves, and commas). Vowel-sounds were frequently written not after, but over, the consonants. Certain letters, like p and q, that occur with extreme. frequency, e.g. in prepositions and terminations, became the source of many peculiar abbreviations; similarly, frequently recurring words like et (and), est (is). Habit and convenience are today the principal motives for using abbreviations. Most of those in actual use fall under one or other of the following heads: [[Administration (business)|Administrative]], [[Liturgical]], [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]], and [[Chronological]].

==Administrative==
The first class of abbreviations includes those used in the composition of [[Pontifical]] documents. They were once very numerous, and lists of them may be seen in the works quoted below (e.g. [[Quantin]], [[Prou]]). It may be well to state at once that since 29 December 1878, by order of [[Leo&amp;nbsp;XIII]], the great papal documents ([[Litterae Apostolicae]]) are no longer written in the old [[goths|Gothic]] hand known as bollatico; all abbreviations, with the exception of a few obvious ones, like S.R.E., were abolished by the same authority ([[Acta Sanctae Sedis]], XI, 465–467). In the transaction of ordinary business the [[Roman Congregations]] are wont to use certain brief and pithy formulas (e.g. Negative = "[[Yes and no|No]]"; Negative et amplius = "No with emphasis"). They are not, correctly speaking, abbreviations. For a list of these see [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]. This class includes also the abbreviations for the names of most sees. The full [[Latin]] titles of all existing (Latin) dioceses may be seen in the Roman annual, "[[Gerarchia Cattolica]]", a complete list of the Latin names of all known dioceses (extant or extinct) is found in the large folio work of the [[Count|Comte]] de [[Mas Latrie]], "Trésor de chronologie, d'histoire et de géographie" (Paris, 1884). For the same purpose the reader may also consult the episcopal catalogues of the [[Benedictine]] [[Pius Bonifacius Gams]], "[[Series Episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae]]" ([[Ratisbon]], 1873–86), and the [[Franciscan]] [[Conrad Eubel]], ''[[Hierarchia Catholica Medii Ævi]]'' ([[Münster]], 1898–1902). Under this general heading may be included all abbreviated forms of addresses in ordinary intercourse, whether of individuals or of members of religious orders, congregations, institutes, to which may be added the forms of addresses usual for members of [[Catholic]] lay societies and the [[Papal]] orders of merit. (See [[Catholic societies]], [[orders of merit]].) The abbreviations of the titles of [[Roman Congregations]], and of the individual canonical ecclesiastical authorities, belong also to this class.

==Liturgical==
A second class of abbreviations includes those used in the description of [[liturgical]] acts or the directions for their performance, e.g. the [[Holy Mass]], the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] ([[Breviary]]), the ecclesiastical devotions, etc. Here may also be classed the abbreviated forms for the name of [[God]], [[Jesus Christ]], and the [[Holy Ghost]]; also for the names of the [[Blessed Virgin]], the saints, etc.; likewise abbreviations used in the administration of the [[Sacraments]], mortuary epitaphs, etc. (to which class belong the numerous [[Catacomb]] inscriptions); finally some miscellaneous abbreviations like those used in the publication of documents concerning beatification and canonization.

==Scholastic==
In the third class belong scholastic abbreviations, used to designate honorific titles acquired in the schools, to avoid the repetition of lengthy titles of books and reviews, or to facilitate reference to ecclesiastical and civil legislation.

==Chronological==
In the fourth class of abbreviations belong all such as are used to describe the elements of the year, civil or ecclesiastical.

Many of his early papers were focused on [[natural history]], but they also cover amphibian conservation, ecological immunology, and general biology.  He is widely published on the life history and conservation of [[Blanchard's cricket frog]] (''[[Acris crepitans blanchardi|Acris blanchardi]]'' ) with papers on its systematics, immunology, behavior, life history, and conservation needs.  He earned the [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in [[Environmental Science]] from [[Arkansas State University]], specializing in [[ecotoxicology]] and [[conservation biology|conservation ecology]].  He continued this research as an Assistant Professor at [[Louisiana State University at Shreveport]] from 2003–2005.

The '''Maon Synagogue''' is a 6th-century [[synagogue]] and archaeological site located in the [[Negev Desert]] near Kibbutz [[Nirim]] and Kibbutz [[Nir Oz]].   It is noted for its "magnificent" [[mosaic]] floor.&lt;ref name=Schaalje&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/99mag/maon/maon.htm] "Mamshit &amp; the Ancient Synagogue of Maon, Jacqueline Schaalje, Jewish Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological finds==
[[Image:Nirim Mosaic1.jpg|thumb|250px|Mosaic detail]]
The original date of the synagogue is uncertain but is before the 6th century.  In a sixth-century renovation, the northern wall (closest to [[Jerusalem]]) was opened and a semi-circular [[apse]] to contain a [[Torah Ark]] was constructed.  The floor level was raised and marble columns and a "breathtakingly beautiful"  mosaic floor installed.&lt;ref name=IAA&gt;[http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=25&amp;subj_id=240&amp;id=1513&amp;module_id=#as] "One of the Most Spectacular Mosaic Floors Ever Discovered in Israel was Restored and Renovated and Can Now be Seen by the General Public," (30/3/09), Israel Antiquities Authority.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the bottom of the mosaic floor is an  [[amphora]] flanked by a pair of peacocks.  A vine flows out of the amphora, forming loops, in each loop is a bird, animal, fruit, or a depiction of steps in the wine making process.   The design is  so similar to the mosaics in the church floor at nearby Shallal that they are thought to have been designed by the same artist.  Both floors depict animals and have similar patterns: the synagogue floor is distinguished by a menorah flanked by two lions and several other Jewish ritual objects.  The seven-branched menorah stands on three legs, like the menorah in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. The legs in Maon are shaped like a lion's paws. Alongside the menorah are the symbols of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], palm trees and lions.  [[Etrog]]s,  a [[shofar]] and a [[lulav]] are depicted nearby.   The Mosaic has an inscription in Aramaic.  The upper part of the inscription blesses all members of the community, the lower part honors three donors.&lt;ref name=Schaalje/&gt;&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land, Avraham Negev, Shimon Gibson, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, p. 349.&lt;/ref&gt;  An identical floor was found in the ancient synagogue in Gaza.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

The synagogue is built on the [[basilica]] plan.  The mosaic is in the central area, the two side aisles were paved with stone.  The ceiling was made of wooden beams and clay.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

A number of small objects were found by the [[Rescue archaeology|salvage dig]] on the floor facing the [[Torah Ark]].  These include coins and bone and metal [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] that are thought to have been associated with the Torah Ark and its ornamental curtain.  There were also  fragments of glass and ceramic lamps.  Dozens of amulets were also found, some of them were used by women who were asking for good health.&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

Adjacent to the ruins of the synagogue a cistern, water channels and a [[mikvah]].&lt;ref name=Schaalje/&gt;

==History==
The synagogue was built at the site of Hellenistic [[Menois]], a city marked on the [[Map of Madaba]]. It is one of three ancient synagogues discovered in the western [[Negev]].&lt;ref name=IAA/&gt;

The synagogue and its mosaic floor were discovered during the construction of a road in 1957. The mosaic was damaged, but the undamaged segment was preserved by a salvage excavation. After its discovery, the mosaic was neglected, causing deterioration.  Restoration work began in 2006, sponsored by the [[Jewish National Fund]], [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and Eshkol Regional Council, and paid for by philanthropist [[Sandy Galet]]. The mosaic was lifted off its original foundation and carefully cleaned.  A new foundation was installed and the mosaic was securely attached.  The mosaic is now protected and was opened to the public in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christiannewstoday.com/christian_news_report_227.html ANCIENT SYNAGOGUE'S MOSAIC FLOOR RESTORED TO ORIGINAL BEAUTY] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215121144/http://www.christiannewstoday.com/Christian_News_Report_227.html |date=2010-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Julian&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/130674]"1,500-year-old Mosaic Floor Unveiled in Ancient Synagogue Ruins,"  03/30/09, Israel National News,   Hana Levi Julian.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4271">'''Methodological individualism''' is the principle that subjective individual motivation explains social phenomena, rather than class or group dynamics which are (according to proponents of individualistic principles) illusory or artificial and therefore cannot truly explain market or social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/methodological-individualism/ Methodological Individualism at the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

== In economics ==
In [[neoclassical economics]], people's behavior is explained in terms of rational choices as constrained by prices and incomes. The neoclassical economist accepts individuals' preferences as given. [[Gary Becker]] and [[George Stigler]] provide a forceful statement of this view:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George|author2=Gary Becker|title=De gustibus non est disputandum|journal=American Economic Review|date=Mar 1977|volume=67|issue=2|page=76|jstor=1807222}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:On the traditional view, an explanation of economic phenomena that reaches a difference in tastes between people or times is the terminus of the argument: the problem is abandoned at this point to whoever studies and explains tastes (psychologists? anthropologists? phrenologists? sociobiologists?). On our preferred interpretation, one never reaches this impasse: the economist continues to search for differences in prices or incomes to explain any differences or changes in behavior.

== Criticisms ==
Economist [[Mark Blaug]] has criticized over-reliance on methodological individualism in economics, saying that "it is helpful to note what methodological individualism strictly interpreted [...] would imply for economics. In effect, it would rule out all macroeconomic propositions that cannot be reduced to microeconomic ones [...] this amounts to saying goodbye to almost the whole of received macroeconomics. There must be something wrong with a methodological principle that has such devastating implications".&lt;ref name=Blaug&gt;{{cite book|last=Blaug|first=Mark|title=The Methodology of Economics: Or, How Economists Explain|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-43678-8|pages=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
The Michelangelo Hand's development was begun by the German prosthetics manufacturer Ottobock. In 2008, the American company Advanced Arm Dynamics became involved with testing and further refinement of the prosthesis.&lt;ref name=ArmDyn/&gt;

The prosthesis is battery-powered and can be used for up to 20 hours between charges.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Constructed of metal and plastic, it is designed with a natural, [[anthropomorphic]] aesthetic, and can be custom-fitted for each user. Its motions are controlled by built-in [[electrode]]s, which detect the movements of the user's remaining arm muscles and interpret them using [[electromyography]] software.&lt;ref name=ArmDyn/&gt; The fingers can form numerous naturalistic configurations to hold, grip or pinch objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/4718|title=Clinical Experiences With The Michelangelo Hand, A Four-Year Review|author=Miguelez, John M.|year=2011|publisher=[[Duke University]] Libraries|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Michelangelo Hand is capable of moving with enough precision to conduct delicate tasks such as cooking, [[ironing]] and opening a [[toothpaste]] tube,&lt;ref name=ArmDyn/&gt; but can also exert enough strength to use an automobile's [[steering wheel]]. Skin-toned cosmetic gloves are also available for the prosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hangerclinic.com/limb-loss/adult-upper-extremity/adv-tech/Pages/Michelangelo-Hand.aspx|title=Michelangelo Hand|publisher=Hanger Clinic|year=2014|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Michelangelo Hand had a unit cost of around £47,000 (US$73,800).&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

The '''Institute of Physics (IOP) of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|Інститут фізики Національної академії наук України}}) founded in 1926 is the oldest research institution of physical science within the Academy. Being on the path of both infrastructure development and research diversification for more than 80 years, the Institute has eventually originated five more specialized research institutions.

Currently, the Institute employs more than 300 researchers (together with two Full Members and eight Corresponding Members of the NASU) and around 200 peoples of supporting personnel. It has more than 20 scientific units (including the state-of-the-art Femtosecond Laser Complex) which are grouped around four research programs

Traditionally, the Institute is focused on fundamental research. At the same time, applied research on cryogenics, LC displays, laser systems, pyroelectric detectors, biophysics and plasma technologies strengthen the Institute's activities.

The IOP is consistently ranked at the top of national academic institutions ranking. Besides, international reputation of IOP is growing constantly as prominent scientists from the Institute expand their activity to leading foreign research centers and universities.

==History==
The origin of the Institute of Physics is dated back to 1921, when the Kyiv Regional Department of Education established the Physics research laboratory. The following year, it was transformed into the Kyiv Science-Research Department of Physics at [[Kyiv Polytechnic Institute]].
The separate entity was established in 1929, when the Department was transformed into the Science-Research Institute of Physics of the People's Commissariat of Education of the Ukrainian SSR. It was eventually renamed as the Institute of Physics of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]. In 2009, the Institute celebrated its 80th anniversary.

Academician O.G. Goldman was the founder and the first director of the Institute, which has 20 employees in 1929, including 6 scientists and 10 graduate students. In the first years of existence, the Institute was mainly focused on the training of young scientists and finding its own areas of specialization. Many people who successfully defended their phd theses in that time then became famous scientists. Among them: academicians [[V.Ye. Lashkaryov]], [[Solomon Isaakovich Pekar|S.I. Pekar]] and V.P. Linnik, associate members of the Academy of Sciences N.D. Morgulis and P.G. Borzyak, doctors of science M.D. Gabovich, O.G. Miselyuk and others.
In 1938, the Institute has 3 major research specializations:
Semiconductor physics (heads O.G. Goldman, V.Ye. Lashkaryov since 1939);
Physics of electronic and electrovacuum processes (head N.D. Morgulis);
X-ray physics of metals (head S.D. Gertsriken)

Before the Soviet Union was attacked by Germany in 1941, the Institute employed 122 persons, including 36 scientists and 7 graduate students. The Institute has also experimental workshops with qualified staff and state-of-the-art equipment. ''Ukrainian physical notes'', a journal, was published between 1929 and 1936.

During [[World War II]], the Institute was relocated in Ufa. Academician [[Aleksandr Leipunskii|A.I. Leipunskii]] (he was the director between 1943 and 1949) and professor G.D. Latyshev from Ukrainian Physical-Technical Institute entered its management team. The focus of the research is directed towards military applications.

After the war, the Institute was quickly restored. In 1953, new buildings for laboratories, production and housing were brought into service on Nauky avenue near the Golosiyivskyi forest.

Some new areas of research activity were developed. Among them: nuclear physics (heads: A.I. Leipunskii and then M.V. Pasichnik), physics of crystals (academician A.F. Prikhot’ko), theoretical physics (academician O.S. Davydov and S.I. Pekar). Electrostatic generator, cyclotron laboratory, and nuclear reactor were put into operation in 1947, 1956, and 1960, correspondingly.

Some specialized research institutes originate from the Institute of Physics. In 1945, on the basis of Diffusion Process Department the Laboratory of Metal Physics was organized, which become the Institute of Metallophysics in 1955. On the basis of the Semiconductor Department, the Institute of Semiconductors was established in 1960. Then, the Institute for Theoretical Physics was established in 1966 from the Department of Elementary Particles. In 1970, some departments were transformed into the [[Institute for Nuclear Research of NASU|Institute for Nuclear Research]] of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. And the Institute of Applied Optics was created on the basis of Optical Quantum Electronics Department.

As a result of such organizational transformations, many famous scientists moved to the new Institutions of the Academy of Sciences. But the Institute of Physics also developed significantly and did not lose its leadership. In the 1960s, new areas such quantum electronics, holography, nonlinear optics, pyroelectronics were developed. The Institute made significant contribution to some fields in physics, such as nuclear physics, semiconductor physics, solid state physics, liquid crystals, quantum electronics, plasma physics, and others. Its scientists received certificates for 5 discoveries – more than any other institution in Ukraine. Moreover, scientists of the Institute were awarded the [[Lenin Prize]], 4 State Prizes of the USSR, and 18 State Prizes of Ukraine in physics.

In 1979, the Institute was awarded the [[Order of the Red Banner]] for its large-scale success in the development of physical science and training the highly qualified personnel.

Due to the unique architecture of the main building of the Institute and painting on its dome made by honoured Ukrainian artist [[M.A. Storozhenko]], the main building of the Institute was recognized to have a significant historical value and listed among other monuments of architecture, history, and art.

==Core research directions==

===Condensed matter and soft matter physics===

The main focus is on the optical and spectroscopic investigations of [[composite material]]s, [[molecular crystal]]s, [[semiconductor]]s, and [[liquid crystal]]s. The properties of [[exciton]]s and other [[quasiparticle]]s are also studied, as well as quantum-dimensional structures. Research interests extend to [[high-temperature superconductivity]], magnetic phenomena such as [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]], [[magnetostriction]], and [[magnetooptics]], as well as optical and magnetic phenomena  in semimagnetic semiconductors. Investigations of defects, both radiation and technological, in semiconductors are of high fundamental and practical importance, as well as developments of radiation techniques for machining semiconductor materials for [[microelectronics]]. Studies of biological systems, phototransformation in [[biomolecule]]s, laser photochemistry and spectroscopy of biomolecules.

===Nanophysics and nanoelectronics===
Such investigations began in the middle of the 1960s, when the Physical Electronics Department started studying discontinuous films and discovered the effect of cold electronic emission from such structures. Now, most of the departments work with nanoscale systems to investigate their optical, magnetic, transport, and photoelectric properties. Research activity is also directed to improving the methods for synthesis of nanoscale objects.

===Laser physics, nonlinear and singular optics, and holography===
The Institute continues investigating the physics gas lasers, solid-state lasers and dye lasers. Also, scientific interest expand to investigations of nonlinear optical phenomena in semiconductor crystals, molecular crystals and liquid crystals, photorefractive materials, polymers, organic molecules, and photopolymer materials for holography and information recording. Many research projects involve nonlinear [[laser spectroscopy]] with ultrahigh resolution, photoacoustic laser spectroscopy and microscopy, or aimed at creating new methods for laser manipulation of free atom particles. There are some traditional research areas, such as [[holography|dynamic holography]], multi-beam optics, speckle fields and holographic correlation methods for laser beam transformation. Also, new investigations in [[singular optics]] are conducted.

===Surface physics, emission and plasma electronics===
Investigations of small particles and their ensembles are conducted. Optical and emission properties of discontinuous films, physical phenomena in adsorbed films, gas and metal adsorption on solid state surfaces, electronic emission, atom structure and phase transitions in two-dimensional systems, characteristics of ordered thin-film molecular systems, solid state plasma phenomena, hot charge carriers and self-organization effects in semiconductors, and phonon transportation in semiconductors are studied.

Physics of ion-beam plasma, plasmodynamics and plasma kinetics are studied. Recently, new highly efficient plasma technologies and devices were created on the basis of fundamental investigations. They include high-current plasma lenses, devices for surface cleaning and coating, plasma sterilizers of medical equipment and materials.

'''Norman Haire''', born '''Norman Zions''' (21 January 1892, [[Sydney]] – 11 September 1952, [[London]]) was an Australian medical practitioner and [[sexologist]]. He has been called "the most prominent sexologist in Britain" between the wars.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography | last=Forster | first=Frank M. C. | year=1996 | id2=haire-norman-10390 | title=Haire, Norman (1892–1952) | accessdate= 3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
When Norman was born in 1892 his parents, Henry and Clara Zions, were living in Sydney at 255 Oxford Street, Paddington.  He was their unplanned and unwanted, 11th and final child.  He was a star debater at Fort Street High School but his plans to be an actor were thwarted when his parents made him study medicine.  He was anxious about his sexuality as a teenager (i.e., he was homosexual), but his chance discovery of [[Havelock Ellis]]' ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'' in Sydney's public library made him decide that he, like Ellis, would devote his life to saving people from sexual misery.  He graduated in 1915 from the [[University of Sydney]], and worked in several obstetric and mental health hospitals before his appointment as Medical Superintendent at [[Royal Newcastle Hospital|Newcastle Hospital]] at the time of the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza pandemic]].  When a patient died, Zions was unjustly held responsible &lt;ref&gt;Diana Wyndham (2000) 'Misdiagnosis or miscarriage of justice? Dr Norman Haire and the 1919 influenza epidemic at Newcastle Hospital', ''Health and History'', July, 2 (1), pp. 3-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and, shortly after, left his homeland for twenty years.

After arriving in London he changed his name to Norman Haire in December 1919 and, five years later, his status as a poor, Jewish outsider had changed to that of a celebrity with a flourishing gynaecological practice in [[Harley Street]], a chauffeur-driven [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls Royce]] and a country house.  He was a feeling, thinking and doing man, equal parts hedonist and humanist; a tall, fat and flamboyant rationalist who was secretly homosexual and said blunt things in a beautiful voice. He sought out Havelock Ellis who introduced him to key people in the fields of eugenics and sexual reform, including birth control pioneers [[Margaret Sanger]], [[Marie Stopes]] and Charles and Bessie Drysdale from the [[Malthusian League]]. In 1921 Haire became the chief honorary medical officer at their free birth-control clinic - the Walworth Women's Welfare Centre in East London.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; In 1923, with a letter of introduction from Ellis, Haire travelled to Berlin to meet [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] (a Jewish, openly gay, socialist sexologist) and visited his [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexual Research).  In 1923 he became a fêted speaker at a [[Cambridge University]] prestigious society called The Heretics.  Five years later Haire captivated the audience at [[Oxford University]] when he became the St John's Essay Society's most illustrious speaker. They were dazzled by Haire whose three-hour and comprehensive exposition received 'intensive and appreciative attention' from an audience that was the largest in the Society's records.&lt;ref&gt;The History of the University of Oxford, The Twentieth Century, edited by Brian Harrison: Oxford: Clarendon. vol. 8 1994, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

People flocked to Haire's leactures and eagerly bought his informative books about birth control and sexology.  In 1922 he took a leading role in the world's first international conference on birth control which was held in London and he also starred in conferences in lecture tours in American and in Germany, France and Spain and he lectured fluently in German, French and Spanish.  He was one of the first to provide the poor with birth control clinics and he convinced Britain's medical profession of the need to learn about contraception and provide it.

Haire managed to combine his medical and theatrical talents and played a small part when
[[Ivor Montagu]] directed a cast of his friends in a 1928 silent slapstick movie called Blue Bottles (British slang for police) which used innovative special effects. The stars were [[Charles Laughton]] and [[Elsa Lanchester]] and it was adapted from a story by [[H G Wells]].
Haire was a superb administrator and with [[Dora Russell]] he organised the [[World League for Sexual Reform]]'s highly successful 1929 congress in London which many of the world's avant-garde attended.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Crozier, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3704509 "All the World's a Stage": Dora Russell, Norman Haire, and the 1929 London World League for Sexual Reform Congress], ''Journal for the History of Sexuality'' 12:1 (Jan. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1930 he was so famous that the society author [[Ethel Mannin]] commented 'The correct answer to 'Do you know who Norman Haire is? is 'Oh, good Lord, who doesn't'.&lt;ref&gt;Ethel Mannin. 'Confessions and Impressions. London: Hutchinson, 1930, p. 194)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, as the Nazis rose to power in Germany [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] fled into exile and, after confiscating Marxist, communist, pacifist, Jewish and other 'un-German' books from libraries and private owners, [[Goebbels]] officiated at the 10 May 1933 [[Nazi book burnings]] in Berlin's Opera Place.  Stormtroopers and Nazi youths burnt about 20,000 books (including some written by Haire) from Hirschfeld's Institute for Sexual Research.

Satisfying people who yearned for longevity made Haire rich. The 'rejuvenation' craze
appealed mostly to men and it was really only a vasectomy (women had their ovaries irradiated) but, until the medical claims were refuted, hopeful patients paid high fees to revitalise their sex lives or defer senility. Having popularised the [[Eugen Steinach|Steinach]] rejuvenation operation throughout the 1920s, within nine years he had Steinached 'rather less than 200' artistic and intellectual men &lt;ref&gt;Norman Haire, 'The importance of sexual disorders and disharmonies in the production of ill-health', in the Third Sexual Reform Congress. Proceedings, London, 8–14 September 1929. London: Kegan Paul, 1930, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; including [[W. B. Yeats]] in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Diana Wyndham, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jhbs.10091/abstract Versemaking and lovemaking—W. B. Yeats' "strange second puberty": Norman Haire and the Steinach rejuvenation operation], ''Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences'', 39:1 (Winter 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s Haire's heart was weakened by [[rheumatic fever]]. In addition he became [[diabetic]] and was incapitated so severely that he was granted an invalid permit to leave Britain during the [[Second World War]].  He returned to Australia, expecting to die or be an invalid but once he began using insulin he was able to resume his medical work in Macquarie Street, Sydney.

In 1941 he began writing a weekly advice column under the pen name 'Dr Wykeham Terriss' for the Australian magazine ''Woman''. He continued to do so for a decade despite strong opposition by the Catholic Church.  The poet and journalist [[Elizabeth Riddell]], in an interview given during her 80s, spoke affectionately about her time on the editorial staff of ''Woman'' in the 1940s; she said that she and Haire were 'honest with each other and got along well'. Editor, columnist and ex-parliamentarian [[Peter Coleman]] called Haire 'one of Australia's most famous free thinkers and sex reformers' and said the column in ''Woman'' was 'probably the most free-thinking series of articles ever written for a mass circulation magazine'.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Coleman, ''Obscenity, Blasphemy, Sedition: Censorship in Australia''. Brisbane: Jacaranda Press, 1962, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=TisXUfr-K6eq4ATF6oDQBg&amp;hl=ru&amp;id=kV1ZAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22Obscenity%2C+blasphemy%2C+seditionn%22&amp;q=most+free-thinking+series#search_anchor P. 82].&lt;/ref&gt; Haire was the key speaker in an [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] radio debate 'Population Unlimited?' in 1944 but was hounded by the security service which suspected him of being 'a secret communist'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2010/2769314.htm Sex and Sin: How Sexologist Norman Haire Shocked Australia], [[ABC Radio National]] - Hindsight&lt;/ref&gt; Following this debate, politicians denounced him in parliament and behind the scenes their sabotage attempts segued into a dramatic court case on 22 March 1945. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' reported on 4 April that Haire had been charged with assaulting a patient with her 'red handbag.'  Haire gave a list of his opponents to his lawyers but, amazingly, he did not believe the woman's charges were part of a 'premeditated plot' but said that, once his enemies and [[Ezra Norton]]'s scandal sheet ''[[Truth (Sydney newspaper)|Truth]]'' found out, 'they decided to exploit it, and encouraged her to make the most of it'. Four days before he was charged, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' noted on 25 April that Haire had withdrawn from rehearsals for his much-acclaimed role as Sir Ralph Bonnington-Bloomfield at the [[Independent Theatre]].  ''Woman'' remained supportive and he continued with the articles. He even wrote about abortion and said he had received 1000 abortion requests from Australian women between 1940 and 1946. When some of the readers accused him of being an abortionist, he wrote on 6 August 1945 that he had 'learned to ignore such scurrilous abuse' although he worried others might be bored by his frequent warnings. This was a brave stance when Australian newspapers refused to print the word 'abortion' and substituted euphemisms such 'an illegal operation' or 'bringing on the periods.'

He returned to London in 1946 and during most of his final years in Britain he bravely persevered in his quest to fine tune sexual morality so that individuals and communities could live as harmoniously as possible.  The [[World League for Sexual Reform]] was disbanded in 1935 so after the [[Second World War]] he established and became president of the Sexual Reform Society and published ''The Journal of Sex Education'' to rekindle the campaign for sexual reform.  History professor Nicholas Edsall wrote: 'More than anyone else it was [Haire] who had kept the issue of [homo-]sexual reform alive, though only barely, through the lean years of the 1930s and the post-war years in Britain.  There were no organisations in Britain comparable to the [[Mattachine Society]] in the United States, [[Arcadie]] in France, or even the [[International Society for Human Rights]] in Germany, let alone the Dutch COC' – the [[Dutch Society for Sexual Reform]]. 'The last, tenuous link with the [[British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology]] 'was broken when 'its post-war successor, the Sex Education Society, died
following the death of Norman Haire' &lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Edsall (2003) 'Toward [[Stonewall riots|Stonewall]]: Homosexuality and society in the modern western world'. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, on a lecture tour of the [[United States]], he suffered a heart attack and was forced to return to London where he died at the age of 60.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;  On 31 October 1952 [[The Times]] advertised the sale of Haire's house at 127 Harley Street and published this Wills and Bequest Notice on 10 December: 'Dr Norman Haire of Harley Street, W and Sydney, Australia, left an estate in England valued at £31,365 (duty paid £2886). He left a bequest to his lifelong companion Willem Van de Haght (the former administrator of the Rotterdam Zoo) and left the library of books and other publications to the University of Sydney, and, after other legacies and bequests, the residue of his property to the university directing that it be paid to the Vice-Chancellor to be applied in such manner as the Senate of the university determines for the study of sexology.'   Haire's executors (his solicitor Philip Kimber and Lloyds Bank Ltd) felt it was in the public interest to ignore his will and destroy his papers. They decided that since he was a sexologist and there was correspondence from a number of distinguished persons which might have caused embarrassment if it fell into the wrong hands, they would burn everything and did so.&lt;ref&gt;John Kelly, quoting Kimber, letter to Diana Wyndham 10 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt; They also burnt the Sex Education Society's records. Fortunately, much of the information has survived because he was a famous lecturer and author who mixed with famous and influential people, many of whom recorded their impressions of him.  The contribution this tenacious, humane, innovative and brave man made to birth control, sexology and human rights history are celebrated in his biography &lt;ref&gt;Diana Wyndham. {{cite web|url= http://purl.library.usyd.edu.au/sup/9781743320068|title='Norman Haire and the Study of Sex'}} Foreword by the Hon. [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] AC CMG. (Sydney: {{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/sup/|title=Sydney University Press}}, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Haire told 'Paddy' O'Connor that he had decided to leave his money to the University of Sydney for the study of sex 'to annoy the wowsers' &lt;ref&gt;Haire's comment to his friend was quoted by [[R. F. Foster (historian)|R F Foster]] in ''WB Yeats: A life. II: The Arch-poet 1915–1939'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 2003, p 497, fn 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Haire's papers are held at the [[University of Sydney]] Library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/HaireEAD.html Guide to the Norman Haire Collection, bulk 1926 - 1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322092534/http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/HaireEAD.html |date=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Records of guidelines related to "people skills" have been found as early as the New Testament. Five examples of early human guidelines appear in the [[Bible]]. [[First Epistle of Peter|1 Peter]] 4:8-9 advises: "Above all, maintain constant love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without complaining."; and [[Solomon]]'s wisdom in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 15:1 includes: "A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.", along similar lines in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 16:21 includes: "The wise of heart is called perceptive, and pleasant speech increases persuasiveness."; [[First Epistle to the Thessalonians|1 Thessalonians]] 5:14 dictates: "And we urge you, beloved, to discourage the idlers, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with all of them."; [[Epistle to Titus|Titus]] 3:2 advises: " To speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show every courtesy to everyone."; and in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] 6:2 encourages: "Bear one another's burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the [[Golden Rule|law]] of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/New-Revised-Standard-Version-NRSV-Bible/ "New Revised Standard Version"] Retrieved on 2009-08-18&lt;/ref&gt;

[[human relations|Human-relations]] studies emerged in the 1920s when companies became more interested in "[[soft skills]]" and interpersonal skills of employees.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} In organizations, improving people skills became a specialized role of the [[corporate trainer]]. By the mid-1930s, [[Dale Carnegie]] popularized people skills in ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'' and ''[[How to Stop Worrying and Start Living]]'' worldwide.

In the 1960s, US schools introduced people-skills topics and methods—often as a way to promote better [[self-esteem]], communication and social interaction. These encompassed psychologist [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)|Thomas Gordon]]'s "Effectiveness Training" variations as well as many other training programs.&lt;ref&gt;Schaps, E.; Cohen, A.Y.; and Resnik, H.S.: [http://www.pire.org/detail.asp?detayl=y&amp;core=11989 "Balancing Head and Heart"] PIRE.

(By the 1980s, "[[traditional education]]" and a "back-to-basics" [[The three Rs|three-Rs]] emphasis largely pushed these programs aside,&lt;ref&gt;Doll, R.C.

The first documented use of the phrase "people skills" was around 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=People+skills&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2CPeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bpeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPeople%20Skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPeople%20skills%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BPEOPLE%20SKILLS%3B%2Cc0 Ngram for people skills]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business impact ==
The SCANS report states that business, labor and government authorities agree that having a wide range of people skills are necessary for 20th-century work success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdr.doleta.gov/SCANS/ "Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS)"] US Dept. of Labor. Retrieved on 2009-08-18&lt;/ref&gt; Skills like customer service, building effective relationships, and teamwork are among the abilities most requested by employers in job postings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burning-glass.com/research/baseline-skills/ "The Human Factor: The Hard Time Employers Have Finding Soft Skills,"] Burning Glass Technologies, November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Lack of these skills is considered a serious psychological handicap. Constructive leadership based companies engage in helping individuals to grow, and through that growth employees take more responsibility and discharge it effectively. This in-turn will enhance the basic attitude of the individual; and that will reflect the general level of performance in workplace.  Studies indicate that many people who have difficulty in obtaining or holding a job possess the needed technical competence but lack interpersonal competence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/human-relations|title=Human Relations facts, information, pictures {{!}} Encyclopedia.com articles about Human Relations|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lawrence A. Appley]] of American Management Association, reflected on these trainings as a responsibility to "increase the knowledge, sharpen and add to the skills, improve the habits, and change the attitudes of many of those for whose development we are responsible."&lt;ref&gt;Harwood F Merrill &amp; Elizabeth Marting (1952). Developing Executive Skills, American Management Association, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of people skills among upper echelons&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palgraveconnect.com/esm/doifinder/10.1057/9781137294678.0713&lt;/ref&gt; (top management) can result in [[bullying]] and/or [[harassment]], which is not uncommon in the modern workplace due to changing values. The causes that are most identified with the situation are lack of necessary motivation, communication, influencing skills and [[empathy gap]] among upper echelons (Gilbert and Thompson, 2002). Training company staff in people skills and interpersonal skills increases the morale and dignity at work (Best, 2010). Employers that do not take steps to prevent harassment can face major costs in decreased productivity, low morale, increased absenteeism and health care costs, and potential legal expenses.

'''''Orange Prince (1984)''''' is a painting by American artist [[Andy Warhol]], of [[Prince (musician)|Prince Rogers Nelson]] (1958–2016), the American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and director.

''Orange Prince'' ''(1984)'' is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Art historian and Warhol expert [[Thomas E. Crow]] believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

Prince did not commission the Warhol portraits, which stayed in Warhol's private collection until he died. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, who was not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:&lt;blockquote&gt;"(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the [[The Factory|Factory]] entourage of the 1960s."&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/44T6MBA/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0032.3.pdf |title=Expert analysis of Warhol's painting of Prince (1984) |author=Thomas E. Crow |date=May 2018 |website=www.pacermonitor.com|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/andy-warhol-self-portrait-1966 |title=Self-Portrai |author=Andy Warhol |date=1966 |website=MoMALearning |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Composition ==
''Orange Prince'' uses a photograph as its source image, which depicts Prince in the burgeoning stages of his career in 1981, three years before the painting was created. The original color photograph shows Prince in a full length pose, from which Warhol isolated the head only for the portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographs/xx5frv/Prince-1981|title=Prince, 1981|website=www.morrisonhotelgallery.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

The composition of ''Orange Prince'' makes direct reference to the portraits Warhol produced in the 1960s, as Crow points out in his 2018 analysis of the painting, and is similar in composition to Warhol's Marilyn series where the subject's head 'floats' in day-glo color.

According to Crow, the composition is distinct from other late portraits, the majority of which were commissions and followed a commercial formula, such as Warhol's portrait of [[Michael Jackson]] which was commissioned and created a few months before ''Orange Prince.'' As Crow says: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Warhol’s 1984 portrait (of Prince)...harked back to the independently conceived celebrity likenesses of his earlier career (from the 1960s). As Prince had not commissioned any of the paintings, Warhol could experiment with far more variations in background patterns and colors."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The face of the subject is depicted in a neon orange color, the same as the background. The facial outline, features and hair are in black. Highlights of green and blue are woven onto the screen amongst the black line around the subject's facial features, hair and ears. The overall effect is to make the subject [[Luminescence|luminesce]], with a trade-mark Warhol flatness to the image, due partly to the very little graduation of shading.

== Prince and Andy Warhol ==
Prince and Andy Warhol were personally acquainted, as Warhol's diary entries show.&lt;ref name="1928–1987" /&gt;

On a number of occasions in the early 1980s Prince had appeared in [[Interview (magazine)|''Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine'']]. In the April 1980 edition Prince appears in a full-page photograph by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/remembering-prince|title=Remembering Prince - Interview Magazine|date=2016-04-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glasstire.com/2016/04/22/prince-1958-2016/|title=Prince (1958-2016) – Glasstire|website=glasstire.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol attended a number of Prince concerts in the 1980s, including one of the very earliest in New York. On December 9, 1980, Prince played [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York as part of his ''[[Dirty Mind Tour]]''. The club was only half-full, but as music critic [[Nik Cohn]] reported, "Andy Warhol and his claque showed up, and so did a number of music-biz faces. Before the show, they lounged in poses of practised cool. Then Prince appeared, and cool went up in flames".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/prince-interview-quotes|title=Prince, the godfather of R&amp;B, had his fingerprints everywhere|last=Cohn|first=Nik|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 1981 edition of Warhol's ''Interview'' magazine Prince appears in a controversial image showing him in the shower, and a crucifix on the wall behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/prince-showers-for-controversy|title=Flashback: Prince Showers for Controversy - Interview Magazine|date=2012-09-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 1984, Warhol created ''Orange Prince''. Prince had released the ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' album and movie that year and was well known internationally. 

On August 2, 1986, Warhol was in the front row at Prince's concert at [[Madison Square Garden]]. In his diary entry of their meeting, Warhol described sitting down at the concert "...just as Prince jumps out naked, or almost, and it's the greatest concert I've ever seen there, just so much energy and excitement."&lt;ref name="1928–1987"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Andy Warhol diaries |last=Warhol |first=Andy |editor-last=Hackett |editor-first=Pat |isbn=9781455561452 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York, NY |oclc=881024850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards at the New York dance club, [[Palladium (New York City)|The Palladium]], Warhol reported that he was very excited to be invited to an after-party hosted by Prince, and fascinated by him. Warhol described arriving at the party and seeing Prince appear in the near-empty club "...in a white coat and pink bellbottoms, like a Puerto Rican at a prom, all by himself". He also stated Prince was a gracious host who remembered the names of the many individuals in Warhol's entourage that night, and how Prince made sure he danced with everyone.

The same party was also attended by [[Billy Idol]]; seeing Prince and Idol together, Warhol observed that "Hollywood glamour girls" such as [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] had been supplanted by "glamour boys" such as Prince and Idol—a development that Warhol found completely fascinating and "...so weird".&lt;ref name="1928–1987"/&gt;

That night, Prince agreed to appear on the December 1986 cover of Warhol's Interview magazine, which Warhol described in his diary:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We asked Prince if he would be our December cover and he said we'd have to talk to his manager and we said that we'd asked the manager and the manager said to ask him, and so they said they'd work it out. We were just shaking, it was so exciting."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Warhol's portrait of Prince was created in 1984, two years before their post-concert meeting in 1986, and remained in Warhol's own collection until he died in 1987.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

== Technique ==
''Orange Prince'' was created using a complex tracing and [[Screen printing|silkscreening]] process, using layers of colors of silkscreen ink on top of a hand-painted orange ground of acrylic polymer paint, applied to [[Canvas print|canvas]]. The technique was popularised by Warhol, and is synonymous with the artist from the 1960s onwards, when he produced his early portraits of [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Marlon Brando]], and other Hollywood movie stars and celebrities of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/21-days-of-andy-warhol/2013/11/andy-warhol-and-his-process.html|title=Andy Warhol &amp; His Process|last=Sotheby's|first=|date=10 Nov 2013|website=sothebys.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1989 MoMA catalogue of Warhol's work, includes a comprehensive description of Warhol's silkscreening technique, provided by the British curator and author Marco Livingstone under the title, “Do It Yourself: Notes on Warhol’s Technique.”&lt;blockquote&gt;A pencil tracing was taken from the full sized [transparent] acetate prepared for the photographic screen. Either by transferring the penciled line by pressing onto the front of the acetate or sheet of paper, or by placing a sheet of carbon paper beneath the tracing and then drawing the line one section at a time, a rough guide was established for each color area, for example, the lips and the eyelids. The colors were then brushed on by hand, often with the use of masking tape to create a clean junction between them, with the eventual imposition of the black screened image also serving to obscure any unevenness in the line. The acetates were examined by Warhol before they were made into screens, so that he could indicate by means of instructions, written and drawn with china-marking crayon, any changes to be made: for example, to increase the tonal contrast by removing areas of half-tone, thereby flattening the image. The position of the image would be established by taping the four corners of the acetate to the canvas and then tearing off the tape along the corner edges of the acetate; the fragments of tape remaining on the canvas would serve as a guide in locating the screen on top. The position of the screen would be confirmed by eye, and it would then be printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_1815_300161087.pdf |title=Andy Warhol, a retrospective : [brochure] the Museum of Modern Art, New York, February 6 to May 2, 1989 |date=1989 |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Orange Marilyn, 1962, silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol.jpeg|thumb|''Orange Marilyn'', 1962, is a silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol from the Marilyn Flavors series.

== Warhol's orange paintings ==
A number of important silkscreen works by Andy Warhol use the color orange. Some of the first silkscreen works from the 1960s use orange as the dominant color, and Warhol continued to use orange in his paintings throughout his lifetime. ''Orange Prince'' shares a compositional style to ''Orange Marilyn'', 1962. A number of orange paintings by Warhol are in museum collections around the world:

The effect of bright colors in Warhol's work is to draw renewed focus to the subject matter. In the ''Death and Disaster'' series of paintings the graphic images Warhol took from tabloid newspaper stories of the time are a stark counterpoint to the candy-color palette. Another example of this is ''Twelve Electric Chairs'' from 1964, which consists of twelve highly contrasting colored images of the electric chair, including ''Orange Little Electric Chair,'' 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/306853/death-and-death-and-death-by-warhol/|title=Death and Death and Death by Warhol|date=2016-06-22|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017, a leading art industry newsletter, Baer Faxt, reported that Warhol’s Orange Marilyn sold in a private transaction for $250 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets2.pacermonitor.com/filings/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0060.1.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEIj%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDFbY044zFyY8bD2myiK3A68z6LvG76TbkfqGMpaaBS8m7uWWyVK5eCsEv%2FpI4Fnl7OjzcrzGEM21YaPitEAgKuEDBdDqovfp%2BV9TJ76lgbD%2FTNqp0POody5rediUNetECE2vNsLgWc2amy1ZOu3biDw4A%2FpXn1cbWZYUhTsUK3yKRcJ3RZ%2FTIpDrna9udqcgsYXSLdurozjAWQzsue5lxtWDVcBiaz9Ig4Xn3ytNO80slqq7DItFcrrxOv7Ywq6bdgx6hP0bptqayCko2tvQdUbAP2FXT6kjS8AFPpCFvmEDlv9hPDtshqNO2M%2BSHR%2F1EP3JwOoPmzaQxH%2Fg6zplJfq8jQYI8bS6hUOoftnD4ht5L1Ddg5WBajvIWXkHWLKuytWc4SC6jAOrsrBj%2FWoLyHGN6sOF1GcAMjr9axS6YqD%2Bk4shA2GTFBk1kJC%2F0CwursUeNaiJh1iyDGdKOEEe9CvwTuXAVvD6Ga7xs0FP%2Beca9hGlR%2BFuwoBqPIfkNzP98Ip%2BEshAtgoguAC%2Beh7EP99XLk4wXbGYL3HwNX%2B7Tp3jDwpJ50z%2FsW7tW3rAmh6KzBxyDdnlAlTuSSNjt%2FP4PVRcz88miwwo%2Fs2n3gU%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20181019T145627Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIA5OSMEZQHIX2MTBXV%2F20181019%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=03c5bd1110bde5df7cf53549731be259c6e59561b57eab01bbe6a38e78bda18d|title=Warhol expert, Laura Paulson, on Warhol's paintings of Prince|last=Laura|first=Paulson|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prince's favorite color was orange ==
In 2017 Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, confirmed that Prince's favorite color was ''orange'', and not purple, as assumed. Also that Prince often wore all-orange stage outfits, had orange sets for concerts and his favorite item was his custom-built orange Cloud guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/08/prince-orange-favorite-color-purple/|title=Prince’s Sister Says His Favorite Color Was Actually Orange, Not Purple|date=2017-08-29|work=Spin|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day icon ==
Art historian, Thomas Crow, believes Warhol depicts Prince as a "modern-day icon" in his painting, referencing religious iconographic paintings: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Warhol's portrait of Prince] returned Warhol to the origins of his art-critical credibility, that is, the flattened, emblematic, minimally descriptive manner that had characterized his first, definitive phase as an artist."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Marilyn Diptych'', 1962, is an early example of iconography in Warhol's work, the image repeated many times to emphasise the ubiquity of celebrity and references a form of religious painting in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/modernity-ap/a/warhol-marilyn-diptych|title=Warhol, Marilyn Diptych|website=Khan Academy|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marilyn "Flavors" portraits – thirteen unique paintings of Marilyn Monroe with different color backgrounds – are also amongst the first examples of Warhol's iconographic style, and graphic use of saturated block color, held by art historians to highlight a manufactured celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-orange-marilyn-4806391-details.aspx|title=Essay by Trevor Fairbrother on the iconographic style of Warhol's portraits including the Marilyn single portrait series from 1962|last=|first=|date=|website=www.christies.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1=George Frei |editor2=Neil Printz |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Catalogue-Raisonn%C3%A9-Paintings-Sculptures-1961-1963/dp/0714840866/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519842007&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=andy+warhol+catalogue+raisonne |title=Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné, Paintings and Sculptures 1961–1963 |author=Andy Warhol Foundation |date=11 Mar 2002 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=9780714840864 |edition=Slp |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Robert Rosenblum was personally close to Warhol and wrote about Warhol's Catholic religious observance, which informed Rosenblum's observation about the 1962 ''Gold Marilyn'' in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When Warhol took a photographic silkscreen of Marilyn Monroe’s head, set it on gold paint, and let it float high in a timeless, spaceless heaven..., he was creating, in effect, a secular saint for the 1960s that might well command as much earthly awe and veneration as, say, a Byzantine Madonna hovering for eternity on a gold mosaic ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laurel.lso.missouri.edu:2083/iii/encore/record/C__Rb13563936__Sjoe%20rosenblum__P0%2C17__Orightresult__X1;jsessionid=4912A4D75A4FD6B390E943219B91FEC2?lang=eng&amp;suite=mobum-sso |title=Robert Rosenblum selected writings on Andy Warhol and other artists|last=Rosenblum|first=R|date=1999|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Geralyn Huxley, curator of film and video at the [[The Andy Warhol Museum|Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh, believes Warhol's preoccupation with celebrity portraits and the style in which he depicts them, stems from the artist's religious upbringing.

Art historian Jane Daggett Dillenberger, in her book ''The Religious Art of Andy Warhol'', points out that Warhol's portraits of celebrities have a strong affinity with the sacred icons at the [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]] in Pittsburgh: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Andy's earliest experience of art was of religious art...for Andy, art and religion were linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Religious-Art-Andy-Warhol/dp/082641334X |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |last=Dillenberger |first=Jane Daggett |date=2001-05-10 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. |isbn=9780826413345 |location=New York; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his New York Times review of the 1989 Warhol retrospective exhibition at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], art critic Michael Brenson says that Warhol's portraits, at their best, bring together diametrically opposite values, such as sensual excess and the purity of an icon, as seen in the portrait of Prince:&lt;blockquote&gt;“[Andy Warhol's] flat images, painted in a flat tone, existing in a non-space from which past and future have been banished ... make the present seem absolute and eternal—in other words, transcendent. Part of Warhol’s achievement was to legitimize his love of secular, profane subjects by attaching to them traditional religious values. ... Warhol argues that self-effacement and sensual excess, purity and trash, the moment and eternity can exist together.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/03/arts/review-art-looking-back-at-warhol-stars-super-heroes-and-all.html|title=Review/Art; Looking Back at Warhol, Stars, Super-Heroes and All|last=Brenson|first=Michael|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Publications ==
''Orange Prince'' painting has been reproduced in books, magazines and other media, most notably as the cover of a commemorative magazine published by [[Condé Nast]] just after Prince's death in 2016.

=== ''Vanity Fair'' ===
The portrait was featured in both the November 1984 and the April 2016 editions of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']], reproduced in color on a full page to illustrate the article entitled ''Purple Fame'', about Prince's rise to fame in the wake of his celebrated [[1984]] album and movie ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]],'' the inspiration for Warhol's portrait.

The ''Vanity Fair'' article claims that Warhol's portrait of Prince captures the recording artist "...at the height of his powers"&lt;ref name="CondeNast"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=2016|title=The Genius of Prince|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Genius-of-Prince/dp/B01F27Q48M|magazine=Condé Nast}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the first global pieces written as a critical appreciation of the musician, coinciding with the start of the recording artist's 98-date [[Purple Rain Tour]]. ''Purple Rain'' is frequently regarded as Prince's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]; declaring that Prince had "...finally arrived", and Warhol's portrait shows Prince as a confident and celebrated musician, now on a world stage and internationally renowned.

=== ''The Genius of Prince'' ===
''Orange Prince (1984)'' was reproduced on the front cover of ''The Genius of Prince'', a commemorative magazine published in the wake of the musician's sudden death just months before. The magazine was published as a US edition by [[Condé Nast]], in June 2016, to wide acclaim and distributed internationally.&lt;ref name=CondeNast/&gt;

=== ''Andy Warhol Treasures'' ===
The portrait also features in ''Andy Warhol Treasures'', a book published in 2009 by Geralyn Huxley.&lt;ref name="Amazon" /&gt;

'''Regenerative cooling''', in the context of [[rocket]] engine design, is a configuration in which some or all of the [[propellant]] is passed through tubes, channels, or in a jacket around the [[combustion chamber]] or nozzle to cool the engine. This is effective because the fuel (and sometimes the oxidizer) are good coolants. The heated propellant is then fed into a special gas generator or injected directly into the main combustion chamber.

==History==
In 1857 [[Carl Wilhelm Siemens]] introduced the concept of regenerative cooling.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  Charles William Siemens, "Improvements in refrigerating and producing ice, and in apparatus or machinery for that purpose", British patent no. 2064 (filed: July 29, 1857).
*  [[Siemens cycle]]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 10 May 1898, [[James Dewar]] used regenerative cooling to become the first to statically liquefy hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*  James Dewar (1898) [https://archive.org/stream/proceedings63royauoft#page/256/mode/2up "Preliminary note on the liquefacion of hydrogen and helium,"] ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', '''63''' :  256-258.
*  {{cite web|title=Liquid Hydrogen as a Propulsion Fuel, 1945-1959|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4404/app-a1.htm|website=NASA  History program Office|publisher=History.nasa.gov|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of regenerative cooling was also mentioned in 1903 in an article by [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsiolkovsky, Konstantin E. (1903) "Исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами" (The exploration of cosmic space by means of reaction devices), ''Научное обозрение'' (Scientific Review) '''5''' :  44-75. (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Goddard]] built the first regeneratively cooled engine in 1923, but rejected the scheme as too complex.&lt;ref&gt;Frank H. Winter, ''Rockets Into Space'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts:  Harvard University Press, 1990), [https://books.google.com/books?id=2nyDsGkPqocC&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 30.]&lt;/ref&gt;  A regeneratively cooled engine was built by the Italian researcher, [[Gaetano Arturo Crocco]] in 1930.  The first Soviet engines to employ the technique were [[Fridrikh Tsander]]'s OR-2 tested in March 1933 and the ORM-50, bench tested in November 1933 by [[Valentin Glushko]].  The first German engine of this type was also tested in March 1933 by Klaus Riedel in the [[Verein für Raumschiffahrt|VfR]]. The Austrian scientist [[Eugen Sänger]] was particularly famous for experiments with engine cooling starting in 1933; however, most of his experimental engines were water-cooled or cooled by an extra circuit of propellant.

The [[V-2 rocket]] engine, the most powerful of its time at 25 [[tonne-force|tons]] (245 [[kilonewton|kN]]) of thrust, was regeneratively cooled, in a design by [[Walter Thiel]], by fuel lines coiled around the outside of the combustion chamber.  This was an inefficient design that required the burning of diluted alcohol at low chamber pressure to avoid melting the engine.  The American [[Redstone (rocket)|Redstone]] engine used the same design.[[File:Roof of combustion chamber V2 rocket engine showing the double wall for regenerative cooling.jpg|thumb|Double walled construction of a V2 rocket engine.]]

A key innovation in regenerative cooling was the Soviet U-1250 engine designed by [[Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev]] in 1945.  Its combustion chamber was lined with a thin copper sheet supported by the corrugated steel wall of the chamber.  Fuel flowed through the corrugations and absorbed heat very efficiently.  This permitted more energetic fuels and higher chamber pressures, and it is the basic plan used in all Russian engines since.  Modern American engines solve this problem by lining the combustion chamber with [[Brazing|brazed]] copper or nickel alloy tubes (although recent engines like in the [[RS-68]] have started to use the Russian technique which is cheaper to construct). The American style of lining the engine with copper tubes is called the "spaghetti construction", and the concept is credited to Edward A. Neu at [[Reaction Motors]] Inc. in 1947.

==Heat flow and temperature==
The heat flow through the chamber wall is very high; 1-20 MW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not uncommon.

The amount of heat that can flow into the coolant is controlled by many factors including the temperature difference between the chamber and the coolant, the [[heat transfer coefficient]], the [[thermal conductivity]] of the chamber wall, the velocity in the coolant channels and the velocity of the gas flow in the chamber or the nozzle.

Two [[boundary layer]]s form: one in the hot gas in the chamber and the other in the coolant within the channels.

Very typically most of the temperature drop occurs in the gas boundary layer since gases are relatively poor conductors. This boundary layer can be destroyed however by [[combustion instability|combustion instabilities]], and wall failure can follow very soon afterwards.

The boundary layer within the coolant channels can also be disrupted if the coolant is at subcritical pressure and film boils; the gas then forms an insulating layer and the wall temperature climbs very rapidly and soon fails. However, if the coolant engages in [[nucleate boiling]] but does not form a film, this helps disrupt the coolant boundary layer and the gas bubbles formed rapidly collapse; this can triple the maximum heat flow. However, many modern engines with turbopumps use supercritical coolants, and these techniques can be seldom used.

Regenerative cooling is seldom used in isolation; film cooling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.me.umn.edu/labs/tcht/measurements/what.html |title=What is Film Cooling? |publisher=Me.umn.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; curtain cooling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Nowicki |url=http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.space.tech/2005-01/0059.html |title=sci.space.tech: Curtain cooling with molten salt |publisher=Sci.tech-archive.net |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2015-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  transpiration cooling, [[radiation cooling]] are frequently employed as well.

==Mechanical considerations==
With regenerative cooling, the pressure in the cooling channels is significantly higher than the chamber pressure, hence the inner liner is under compression, while the outer wall of the engine is under significant [[hoop stress]]es.

The metal of the inner liner is greatly weakened by the high temperature, and also undergoes significant thermal expansion at the inner surface while the cold-side wall of the liner constrains the expansion. This sets up significant thermal stresses that can cause the inner surface to crack or [[Crazing|craze]] after multiple firings particularly at the throat.

In addition the thin inner liner requires mechanical support to withstand the compressive loading due to the propellant's pressure; this support is usually provided by the side walls of the cooling channels and the backing plate.

The inner liner is usually constructed of relatively high temperature, high thermal conductivity materials; traditionally copper or nickel based alloys have been used.

Several different manufacturing techniques can be used to create the complex geometry necessary for regenerative cooling. These include a corrugated metal sheet brazed between the inner and outer liner; hundreds of pipes brazed into the correct shape, or an inner liner with milled cooling channels and an outer liner around that.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://pdf.aiaa.org/JournalsOnline/PDFFiles/07484658_v19n6/aiaa/07484658/v19n6/s3.pdf?CFID=3391727&amp;CFTOKEN=38326472&amp;jsessionid=5c301cc251e346172939TR |title=History of Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines in Russia, Formerly the Soviet Union |author=George P.

The geometry can also be created through direct metal [[3D printing]], as seen on some newer designs such as the [[SpaceX]] [[SuperDraco]] rocket engine.

'''SIT Study Abroad''' is a university-level [[Study abroad organization|study abroad program]] administered by [[World Learning]], a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) international non-profit organization]] based in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], [[United States]]. Like its sister-program the [[SIT Graduate Institute]], the program is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]] through its Commission on Institutions of Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/ NEASC Roster of Accredited Institutions.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828132004/http://cihe.neasc.org/about_our_institutions/roster_of_institutions/ |date=2013-08-28 }} Accessed: May 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gooverseas.com/sit-study-abroad-reviews GoOverseas.com SIT Study Abroad Reviews.] Accessed May 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

SIT Study Abroad offers semester and summer-long thematic programs in over 40 countries around the world.  More than 25,000 students have studied abroad with SIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/thebrownandwhiteblog/index.ssf/2012/03/the_sit_study_abroad_expereinc.html “Students Lectured on SIT Study Abroad Experience,” The Brown &amp; White Blog.] Accessed May 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; All programs are run by Academic Directors who are residents of the host country and experts in the specific academic subject area of the program. Programs incorporate classroom-based and field-based learning as well as an [[independent study|independent study project]] component. Students live in [[homestay]]s, are involved in host community cultural activities and participate in excursions.  All programs study a particular global issue such as health, ecology, conflict transformation, or development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/osuabroad/2011/03/15/study-abroad-with-sit/ OSU Abroad Blog.] Accessed: May 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegenews.com/article/the_advantages_of_field_based_study_abroad_with_sit “Advantages of Field-Based Study Abroad,” CollegeNews.com.] Accessed May 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
SIT Study Abroad’s academic programs use a field-based, experimental approach. Students complete undergraduate research through an Independent Study Project, the content of which is supervised by their advisors. The students have access to SIT’s local resources and networks during their stay, including a small group of their peers that participate in each program. The foundation of SIT’s educational philosophy holds a strong commitment to reciprocity that is fostered through the students experience abroad.

Students may elect to participate in an International Honors Program (IHP). This type of program involves studying in multiple destinations while exploring social justice and sustainability which can offer a more cross-cultural educational experience. IHP and SIT Study Abroad have long shared a profound and defining commitment to intercultural communication, social justice, and experiential learning. IHP’s partnership with SIT Study Abroad and World Learning dates back to 2007, when SIT became IHP’s official school of record. The integration between the two partners deepened in the 2011-2012 academic year, when IHP was first included in SIT Study Abroad’s portfolio of programs. Building on a distinguished 50-plus-year history, IHP comparative programs continue to challenge students to ask new and better questions about their lifelong roles in a global community. Comparative programs offer students the opportunity to investigate significant global issues in at least three countries. Some topics include: Cities in the 21st Century, Climate Change, The Politics of Food, Health and Community, and Human Rights.

==Programs==
SIT has many programs in countries all over the world with a particular focus in developing nations. Each program is designed around a different theme that is relative to the country the student will study in. The website has a full list of current programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studyabroad.sit.edu/programs/ "SIT Study Abroad programs"] Accessed March 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

For more than fifty years, SIT has provided carefully designed and thoughtfully facilitated study abroad programs rooted in the experiential education learning model. This model, as popularized by David Kolb, guides students through an intentional approach to structured and unstructured experiences and a facilitated and mentored process of translating experience into learning in order to prepare them for more independent inquiry. Most SIT programs have 20–25 students led by one academic director plus a number of local staff. Semester programs last 15–16 weeks and summer programs are 4–9 weeks. All programs begin with a thorough orientation that incorporates health and safety information and tools for cross-cultural adaptation. Every program is framed around a critical global issue, which provides a lens through which students explore the issue through theory and its local manifestation. Student learning happens through multiple formats — lectures, field visits, language study, homestays, and day-to-day interactions with local communities — in classroom and field-based settings.

SIT students learn to put into practice appropriate field research methods such as participant observation, cultural analysis, interviews, transects, oral histories, and quantitative data collection. They apply tools of investigation and analysis and develop greater curiosity, confidence, and self-awareness.Every program concludes with a guided reflection and discussion period that examines the impact of the experience. Through this reentry preparation, students are encouraged to consider how they can incorporate their experience in the future. During this time, students also have the opportunity to provide feedback on their program.

==Returnees of SIT programs==
Even prior to the explosion of the popularity of study abroad SIT was generating effective leaders, professionals, and citizens. SIT has a worldwide network of individuals and organizations committed to responsible global citizenship. Those who have completed SIT programs have an understanding of global issues, such as globalization and development. Students are immersed in language while in country and learn new research methods.

There are also many opportunities for those who have returned.

==Certification and professional competency==

Part of SPE's mission is to assist members in furthering their technical and professional competence. Defining required knowledge for different areas of engineering, and offering an opportunity to demonstrate technical knowledge through examination are two of the ways that SPE accomplishes this.  A SPE-certified petroleum professional is competent to provide reserves for oil and gas in accordance with the guidelines promulgated by the [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spe.org/spe-app/spe/career/cert_comp/certification.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-petroleum.org/publications/other.htm World Petroleum Congress&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dallas.bizjournals.com/dallas/related_content.html?topic=Society%20of%20Petroleum%20Engineers Dallas Business Journal: Society of Petroleum Engineers related content&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spe.org/spe-site/spe/spe/industry/reserves/Petroleum_Resources_Management_System_2007.pdf Petroleum Resources Management System]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petroleum professional certification==
While the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and some other countries have [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|professional engineer]] registration programs, many other countries do not. The Society of Petroleum Engineers developed a certification program for petroleum engineers to demonstrate their technical knowledge, the SPE certification program, which requires a thorough knowledge of the principles of petroleum engineering.&lt;ref name="comp"&gt;Society of Petroleum Engineers. [http://www.spe.org/spe-app/spe/career/cert_comp/competency.htm Increase Your Knowledge] (listing of training, certification, and other professional development programs), SPE.org. Retrieved April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The requirements to receive the SPE certification, as listed on the SPE website in April 2013:
* Undergraduate degree in petroleum engineering or related science
* Passing score on the SPE exam to measure level of engineering fundamentals and ability to solve practical engineering problems.
* Demonstration of at least four years of practical engineering experience and training in the industry
* Professional membership in good standing with the Society of Petroleum Engineers&lt;ref name="spe pec"/&gt;

Maintenance of the certification requires completing 16 hours of continued professional development and education, in addition to paying an annual renewal fee (USD$40).&lt;ref name="cert"&gt;Society of Petroleum Engineers. [http://www.spe.org/training/certification.php Petroleum Engineering Certification], SPE.org. Retrieved April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Waivers ===
The exam may be waived for those who pass a written competency examination to practice petroleum engineering as a registered, licensed, or professional engineer. Exams administered by Indonesia (IATMI), Alberta, Canada, and all United States are acceptable. University exit exams are not considered valid for this waiver.

==Professional competency matrices==
Beyond basic engineering skills, many disciplines require specialized expertise gained through training and experience. SPE has identified the skills associated with various levels of competency in five primary areas of engineering.

==Guide to professional conduct==
SPE's board has set forth the expectations for professional and ethical behavior by petroleum professionals.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''shade tree''' is a large tree whose primary role is to provide shade in the surrounding environment due to its spreading [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] and [[crown (botany)|crown]], where it may give shelter from [[sunlight]] in the heat of the summer for people who seek recreational needs in [[urban parks]] and house [[Front yard|yard]]s, and thus, also protecting them from the sun's harmful [[UV rays]] and [[sunburn]]s. Therefore, some shade trees may be grown specifically for the comfort of the population due to their convenient shelter. 

Furthermore, shade trees are also effective in reducing the energy used in cooling homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/all-about-shade-trees All About Shade Trees]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular shade trees==
Some of the most popular shade trees in [[temperate countries]] are [[oak]]s, [[Platanaceae|plane trees]], [[willow]]s, [[birch]]es, [[beech]]es, [[maple]]s, [[ash (tree)|ashes]], [[Tilia|lindens]], and [[elm]]s. In subtropical countries like Australia and India, [[figs]] are popular choices as shade trees.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.specialitytrees.com.au/trees/categories/shade-tree-a5tx6 Shade Tree]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[tropical countries]], trees such as the [[African tulip tree]] and some [[Erythrina]] species are often planted as shade trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Products/AFDbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1756 AgroForestryTree Database - Species information] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130113150200/http://www.worldagroforestry.org/sea/Products/AFDbases/af/asp/SpeciesInfo.asp?SpID=1756 |date=2013-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planting==
There are a few factors to consider when choosing a shade tree: [[deciduous]]ness, coverage, longevity, and the ability of the roots to damage foundations. Shade trees can enhance the privacy of a [[back garden|garden]], [[patio]], or [[back yard]], by obstructing the view of outsiders.  A disadvantage is that in cool climates, an abundance of shade trees may lead to a dank environment in any nearby buildings or gardens. Shade trees must not be planted near chimneys as flying fire sparks can ignite tree branches which could cause rapidly expanding fires.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt;

Planting shade trees around a home can also reduce the energy that homeowners use in the summer months. Planting shade trees in locations near a home air conditioner can keep the air conditioner cooler which helps it run more efficiently, so less energy is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arborday.org/trees/climatechange/summerShade.cfm|title=How to Plant Trees to Conserve Energy for Summer Shade - Climate Change at arborday.org|website=www.arborday.org|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Psychology sidebar|basic}}
'''Social psychology''' is the [[Science|scientific]] study of how people's [[thought]]s, [[feeling]]s, and [[behavior]]s are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Allport|first=G. W|year=1985|title=The historical background of social psychology|editor1-first=G|editor1-last=Lindzey|editor2-first=E|editor2-last=Aronson|encyclopedia=The Handbook of Social Psychology|location=New York|publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]}}p.5&lt;/ref&gt; In this definition, ''scientific'' refers to the [[empirical]] investigation using the [[scientific method]]. The terms ''thoughts'', ''feelings'', and ''behavior'' refer to [[psychology|psychological]] variables that can be measured in humans. The statement that others' presence may be ''imagined'' or ''implied'' suggests that humans are malleable to social influences even when alone, such as when watching television or following internalized [[norm (sociology)|cultural norms]]. Social psychologists typically explain [[human behavior]] as a result of the interaction of [[mind|mental states]] and social [[situationism (psychology)|situations]].

Social psychologists examine factors that cause behaviors to unfold in a given way in the presence of others. They study conditions under which certain behavior, actions, and feelings occur. Social psychology is concerned with the way these feelings, thoughts, beliefs, intentions, and goals are cognitively constructed and how these mental representations, in turn, influence our interactions with others.

Social psychology traditionally bridged the gap between psychology and sociology. During the years immediately following [[World War II]] there was frequent collaboration between psychologists and sociologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=W. H|year=1989|title=Some reflections on the golden age of interdisciplinary social psychology|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=15|doi=10.1146/annurev.so.15.080189.000245|pages=1–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two disciplines, however, have become increasingly specialized and isolated from each other in recent years, with sociologists focusing on "macro variables" (e.g., social structure) to a much greater extent than psychologists.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Nevertheless, [[Social psychology (sociology)|sociological approaches]] to psychology remain an important counterpart to psychological research in this area.

In addition to the split between psychology and sociology, there has been a somewhat less pronounced difference in emphasis between American social psychologists and [[Europe]]an social psychologists. As a generalization, American researchers traditionally have focused more on the individual, whereas Europeans have paid more attention to group level phenomena (see [[group dynamics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moscovici|first1=S|last2=Markova|first2=I|year=2006|title=The Making of Modern Social Psychology|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Polity Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Although there were some older writings about social psychology, such as those by Islamic philosopher [[Al-Farabi]] (Alpharabius),&lt;ref name=Amber&gt;{{cite journal|author=Amber Haque|year=2004|title=Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=43|issue=4|pages=357–377|jstor=27512819|doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4302-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; the discipline of social psychology, as its modern-day definition, began in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century. By that time, though, the discipline had already developed a significant foundation. Following the 18th century, those in the emerging field of social psychology were concerned with developing concrete explanations for different aspects of human nature.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} They attempted to discover concrete cause and effect relationships that explained the social interactions in the world around them. In order to do so, they believed that the [[scientific method]], an empirically based scientific measure, could be applied to human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gergen| first1= K. J. |year=1973| title= Social Psychology as History |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=26| issue= 2 | pages= 309–320| doi=10.1037/h0034436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published study in this area was an experiment in 1898 by [[Norman Triplett]], on the phenomenon of [[social facilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Triplett|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Triplett|year=1898|title=The dynamogenic factors in pacemaking and competition|journal=[[American Journal of Psychology]]|volume=9|pages=507–533|doi=10.2307/1412188|issue=4|jstor=1412188}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1930s, many [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychologists, most notably [[Kurt Lewin]], fled to the United States from Nazi Germany. They were instrumental in developing the field as something separate from the [[behaviorism|behavioral]] and [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] schools that were dominant during that time, and social psychology has always maintained the legacy of their interests in [[perception]] and [[cognition]]. [[Attitude (psychology)|Attitudes]] and [[communication in small groups|small group]] phenomena were the most commonly studied topics in this era.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

During World War II, social psychologists studied [[persuasion]] and [[propaganda]] for the U.S. military&lt;!-- Should a link to [[psychological warfare]] be in here? --&gt;. After the war, researchers became interested in a variety of social problems, including [[gender]] issues and [[racial prejudice]].  Most notable, revealing, and contentious of these were the [[Stanley Milgram shock experiments]] on [[obedience to authority]]. In the sixties, there was growing interest in new topics, such as [[cognitive dissonance]], [[Bystander effect|bystander intervention]], and [[aggression]]. By the 1970s, however, social psychology in America had reached a crisis. There was heated debate over the ethics of laboratory experimentation, whether or not attitudes really predicted behavior, and how much science could be done in a cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gergen|first=Kenneth J|authorlink=Kenneth Gergen|year=1973|title=Social psychology as history|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|volume=26|pages=309–320|doi=10.1037/h0034436|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the time when a radical [[situationism (psychology)|situationist]] approach challenged the relevance of self and personality in psychology.&lt;ref name="social-psychology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/|title=Social Psychology: Definition, History, Methods, Applications - IResearchNet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s social psychology reached a more mature level. Two of the areas social psychology matured in were theories and methods.&lt;ref name="social-psychology"/&gt; Careful [[Research ethics|ethical standards]] now regulate research. [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|Pluralistic]] and [[multicultural]] perspectives have emerged. Modern researchers are interested in many phenomena, but [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]], [[social cognition]], and the self-concept are perhaps the greatest areas of growth in recent years.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Social psychologists have also maintained their applied interests with contributions in the social psychology of health, education, law, and the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Kassin, S., Fein, S., &amp; Markus, H.R. (2017). ''Social psychology'' (10th edition). Belmont, CA: Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrapersonal phenomena==

===Attitudes===
{{Main|Attitude (psychology)}}
In social psychology, attitudes are defined as learned, global evaluations of a person, object, place, or issue that influence thought and action.&lt;ref name=Sison&gt;{{cite book|last=Sison|first=Erick Louie. A|year=2008|title=The dynamics of persuasion|location=New York|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2012}} Put more simply, attitudes are basic expressions of approval or disapproval, favorability or unfavorability, or as Bem put it, likes and dislikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bem|first=D|year=1970|title=Beliefs, attitudes, and human affairs|location=Belmont, CA|publisher=Brooks/Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples would include liking chocolate ice cream, or endorsing the values of a particular political party.

Social psychologists have studied attitude formation, the structure of attitudes, attitude change, the function of attitudes, and the relationship between attitudes and behavior. Because people are influenced by the situation, general attitudes are not always good predictors of specific behavior. For example, for a variety of reasons, a person may value the environment but not recycle a can on a particular day.

In recent times, research on attitudes has examined the distinction between traditional, self-reported attitude measures and "implicit" or unconscious attitudes. For example, experiments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McConnell|first=Allen|date=September 2001|title=Relations among the Implicit Association Test, Discriminatory Behavior, and Explicit Measures of Racial Attitudes|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103100914707|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=37|issue=5|pages=435–442|via=|doi=10.1006/jesp.2000.1470}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the [[Implicit Association Test]] have found that people often demonstrate implicit bias against other races, even when their explicit responses reveal equal mindedness. One study found that explicit attitudes correlate with verbal behavior in interracial interactions, whereas implicit attitudes correlate with nonverbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heider|first1=J. D|last2=Skowronski|first2=J. J|year=2007|title=Improving the Predictive Validity of the Implicit Association Test|journal=[[North American Journal of Psychology]]|volume=9|pages=53–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One hypothesis on how attitudes are formed, first advanced by [[Abraham Tesser]] in 1983, is that strong likes and dislikes are ingrained in our [[genetic make-up]]. Tesser speculates that individuals are disposed to hold certain strong attitudes as a result of inborn physical, sensory, and [[cognitive skill]]s, temperament, and [[personality traits]]. Whatever disposition nature elects to give us, our most treasured attitudes are often formed as a result of exposure to attitude objects; our history of rewards and punishments; the attitude that our parents, friends, and enemies express; the social and cultural context in which we live; and other types of experiences we have. Obviously, attitudes are formed through the basic process of learning. Numerous studies have shown that people can form strong positive and negative attitudes toward neutral objects that are in some way linked to emotionally charged stimuli.&lt;ref name=Kassin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kassin|first1=Saul|title=Social Psychology|year=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|location=Boston, NY|isbn=978-0-618-86846-9|edition=7|first2=Steven|last2=Fein|first3=Hazel Rose|last3=Markus}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|185–186}}

Attitudes are also involved in several other areas of the discipline, such as [[Conformity (psychology)|conformity]], [[interpersonal attraction]], social perception, and [[prejudice]].

===Persuasion===
{{Main|Persuasion}}
The topic of persuasion has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Persuasion is an active method of influence that attempts to guide people toward the adoption of an attitude, idea, or behavior by rational or emotive means. Persuasion relies on "appeals" rather than strong pressure or [[coercion]]. Numerous variables have been found to influence the persuasion process; these are normally presented in five major categories: ''who'' said ''what'' to ''whom'' and ''how''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology, Tenth Edition|last=Myers|first=David|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2010|isbn=978-0-07-337066-8|location=New York|pages=234–253|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[dual process theory|Dual-process theories]] of persuasion (such as the [[elaboration likelihood model]]) maintain that the persuasive process is mediated by two separate routes; central and peripheral. The central route of persuasion is more fact-based and results in longer lasting change, but requires motivation to process. The peripheral route is more superficial and results in shorter lasting change, but does not require as much motivation to process. An example of a peripheral route of persuasion might be a politician using a flag lapel pin, smiling, and wearing a crisp, clean shirt. Notice that this does not require motivation to be persuasive, but should not last as long as persuasion based on the central route. If that politician were to outline exactly what they believed, and their previous voting record, this would be using the central route, and would result in longer lasting change, but would require a good deal of motivation to process.

===Social cognition===
{{Main|Social cognition}}
Social cognition is a growing area of social psychology that studies how people perceive, think about, and remember information about others.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Much research rests on the assertion that people think about (other) people differently from non-social targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moskowitz|first=Gordon B|title=Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others|year=2005|publisher=Guilford|isbn=978-1-59385-085-2|series=Texts in Social Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;dq=%22Social+Cognition%22+Moskowitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This assertion is supported by the social cognitive deficits exhibited by people with Williams syndrome and autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dobbs|first1=Davis|title=The Gregarious Brain| newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = 8 July 2007 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/08/magazine/08sociability-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Person perception]] is the study of how people form impressions of others. The study of how people form beliefs about each other while interacting is known as [[interpersonal perception]].

A major research topic in social cognition is attribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reisenzein|first1=Rainer|last2=Rudolph|first2=Udo|title=50 Years of Attribution Research|journal= [[Social Psychology (journal)|Social Psychology]] |volume=39|issue=3|year=2008|pages=123–124|issn=1864-9335|doi=10.1027/1864-9335.39.3.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attributions are the explanations we make for people's behavior, either our own behavior or the behavior of others. One element of attribution ascribes the locus of a behavior to either internal or external factors. An ''internal'', or dispositional, attribution assigns behavior to causes related to inner traits such as personality, disposition, character or ability. An ''external'', or situational, attribution involves situational elements, such as the weather.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|111}}  A second element of attribution ascribes the cause of behavior to either stable or unstable factors (whether the behavior will be repeated or changed under similar circumstances). Finally, we also attribute causes of behavior to either controllable or uncontrollable factors: how much control one has over the situation at hand.

Numerous biases in the attribution process have been discovered. For instance, the [[fundamental attribution error]] is the tendency to make dispositional attributions for behavior, overestimating the influence of personality and underestimating the influence of situations.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|724}} The actor-observer difference is a refinement of this bias, the tendency to make dispositional attributions for other people's behavior and situational attributions for our own.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|107}} The [[self-serving bias]] is the tendency to attribute dispositional causes for successes, and situational causes for failure, particularly when self-esteem is threatened. This leads to assuming one's successes are from innate traits, and one's failures are due to situations, including other people.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|109}} Other ways people protect their self-esteem are by [[just-world phenomenon|believing in a just world]], blaming victims for their suffering, and making [[defensive attribution hypothesis|defensive attributions]], which explain our behavior in ways which defend us from feelings of vulnerability and mortality.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|111}} Researchers have found that mildly [[Clinical depression|depressed]] individuals often lack this bias and actually have [[depressive realism|more realistic perceptions of reality]] (as measured by the opinions of others).&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Andrews2001.pdf |pmid=11182572|year=2001|last1=Andrews|first1=P. W.|title=The psychology of social chess and the evolution of attribution mechanisms: Explaining the fundamental attribution error|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=22|issue=1|pages=11–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heuristics in judgment and decision making|Heuristic]]s are cognitive short cuts. Instead of weighing all the evidence when making a decision, people rely on heuristics to save time and energy. The [[availability heuristic]] occurs when people estimate the [[probability]] of an outcome based on how easy that outcome is to imagine. As such, vivid or highly memorable possibilities will be perceived as more likely than those that are harder to picture or are difficult to understand, resulting in a corresponding cognitive bias.{{Contradict-inline|article=Availability heuristic|date=March 2012}} The representativeness heuristic is a shortcut people use to categorize something based on how similar it is to a prototype they know of.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|63}} Numerous other biases have been found by social cognition researchers. The [[hindsight bias]] is a [[Confabulation|false memory]] of having predicted events, or an exaggeration of actual predictions, after becoming aware of the outcome. The [[confirmation bias]] is a type of bias leading to the tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Another key concept in social cognition is the assumption that reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, we tend to see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. [[schema (psychology)|Schemas]] are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate [[automaticity|automatically]] and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that people are more likely to misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Correll|first1=Joshua|last2=Park|first2=Bernadette|last3=Judd|first3=Charles M|last4=Wittenbrink|first4=Bernd|title=The police officer's dilemma: Using ethnicity to disambiguate potentially threatening individuals|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=83|issue=6|year=2002|pages=1,314–1,329|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.6.1314|citeseerx=10.1.1.466.7243}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of schema is actually a [[stereotype]], a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an [[ultimate attribution error]]). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior ([[discrimination]]). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as ''scripts''.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Self-concept===
{{Main|Self-concept}}
Self-concept is a term referring to the whole sum of beliefs that people have about themselves. However, what specifically does self-concept consist of? According to Hazel Markus (1977), the self-concept is made up of cognitive molecules called [[self-schema]]s&amp;nbsp;– beliefs that people have about themselves that guide the processing of self-reliant information. For example, an athlete at a university would have multiple selves that would process different information pertinent to each self: the student would be one "self," who would process information pertinent to a student (taking notes in class, completing a homework assignment, etc.); the athlete would be the "self" who processes information about things related to being an athlete (recognizing an incoming pass, aiming a shot, etc.). These "selves" are part of one's identity and the self-reliant information is the information that relies on the proper "self" to process and react on it. If a "self" is not part of one's identity, then it is much more difficult for one to react. For example, a civilian may not know how to handle a hostile threat as a trained Marine would. The Marine contains a "self" that would enable him/her to process the information about the hostile threat and react accordingly, whereas a civilian may not contain that self, disabling them from properly processing the information from the hostile threat and, furthermore, debilitating them from acting accordingly. Self-schemas are to an individual’s total self–concept as a hypothesis is to a theory, or a book is to a library. A good example is the body weight self-schema; people who regard themselves as over or underweight, or for those whom body image is a significant self-concept aspect, are considered ''schematics'' with respect to weight. For these people a range of otherwise mundane events&amp;nbsp;– grocery shopping, new clothes, eating out, or going to the beach&amp;nbsp;– can trigger thoughts about the self. In contrast, people who do not regard their weight as an important part of their lives are ''a-schematic'' on that attribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Markus|first=Hazel|title=Self-Schemata and Processing Information|journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |year=1977|volume=35|issue=2|pages=63–78|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.2.63 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rather clear that the self is a special object of our [[attention]]. Whether one is mentally focused on a [[memory]], a [[conversation]], a foul smell, the song that is stuck in one's head, or this sentence, [[consciousness]] is like a spotlight. This [[:wikt:spotlight|spotlight]] can shine on only one object at a time, but it can switch rapidly from one object to another and process the information out of [[awareness]].{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=Process which information? And consciousness implies awareness...}} In this spotlight the self is front and center: things relating to the self have the spotlight more often.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The self's ABCs are affect, behavior, and cognition. An affective (or emotional) question: How do people evaluate themselves, enhance their self-image, and maintain a secure sense of identity? A behavioral question: How do people regulate their own actions and present themselves to others according to interpersonal demands? A [[cognitive]] question: How do individuals become themselves, build a self-concept, and uphold a stable sense of identity?&lt;ref name=Kassin /&gt;{{rp|53}}

[[Affective forecasting]] is the process of [[prediction|predicting]] how one would feel in response to future [[emotional]] events. Studies done by [[Timothy Wilson]] and [[Daniel Gilbert (psychologist)|Daniel Gilbert]] in 2003 have shown that people overestimate the strength of reaction to anticipated positive and negative life events that they actually feel when the event does occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D|authorlink1=Timothy Wilson|first2=Daniel T|last2=Gilbert|title=Affective Forecasting|journal= Advances in Experimental Psychology |year=2003|issue=35|pages=345–411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories on the perception of our own behavior. Daryl Bem's (1972) self-perception theory claims that when internal cues are difficult to interpret, people gain self-insight by observing their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bem|first=Daryl J|title=Self Perception Theory|year=1972|volume=6|pages=1–62|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60024-6|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=978-0-12-015206-3|chapter=Self-Perception Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Festinger]]'s 1954 [[social comparison theory]] is that people evaluate their own abilities and opinions by comparing themselves to others when they are uncertain of their own ability or opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Festinger|first=Leon|authorlink=Leon Festinger|title=A theory of social comparison process|journal= [[Human Relations (journal)|Human Relations]] |year=1954|volume=7|pages=117–140|doi=10.1177/001872675400700202|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the [[facial feedback hypothesis]]: that changes in facial expression can lead to corresponding changes in emotion.&lt;ref name=Kassin /&gt;{{rp|56}}

The fields of social psychology and [[Personality psychology|personality]] have merged over the years, and social psychologists have developed an interest in self-related phenomena. In contrast with traditional personality theory, however, social psychologists place a greater emphasis on cognitions than on traits. Much research focuses on the [[self-concept]], which is a person's understanding of their self. The self-concept is often divided into a cognitive component, known as the ''self-schema'', and an evaluative component, the ''self-esteem''. The need to maintain a healthy [[self-esteem]] is recognized as a central human [[motivation]] in the field of social psychology.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Self-efficacy]] beliefs are associated with the self-schema. These are expectations that performance on some task will be effective and successful. Social psychologists also study such self-related processes as [[self-control]] and [[impression management|self-presentation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

People develop their self-concepts by varied means, including [[introspection]], feedback from others, [[Self-perception theory|self-perception]], and social comparison. By comparing themselves to relevant others, people gain information about themselves, and they make inferences that are relevant to self-esteem. Social comparisons can be either "upward" or "downward," that is, comparisons to people who are either higher in status or ability, or lower in status or ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology|last=Baron|first=Robert A.|last2=Branscombe|first2=Nyla R.|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-0-205-20558-5|location=United States of America|pages=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downward comparisons are often made in order to elevate self-esteem.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Self-perception is a specialized form of attribution that involves making inferences about oneself after observing one's own behavior. Psychologists have found that too many extrinsic rewards (e.g. money) tend to reduce intrinsic motivation through the self-perception process, a phenomenon known as [[overjustification]]. People's attention is directed to the reward and they lose interest in the task when the reward is no longer offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deci|first1=E. L|last2=Koestner|first2=R|last3=Ryan|first3=R. M|year=2001|title=Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motivation in education: Reconsidered once again|journal=71|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important exception to [[reinforcement]] theory.

==Interpersonal phenomena==

===Social influence===
{{Main|Social influence}}
Social influence is an overarching term given to describe the persuasive effects people have on each other. It is seen as a fundamental value in social psychology and overlaps considerably with research on attitudes and persuasion. The three main areas of social influence include: [[conformity]], [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], and [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. Social influence is also closely related to the study of group dynamics, as most principles of influence are strongest when they take place in social groups.

The first major area of social influence is conformity. Conformity is defined as the tendency to act or think like other members of a group. The identity of members within a group, i.e. status, similarity, expertise, as well as cohesion, prior commitment, and accountability to the group help to determine the level of conformity of an individual. Individual variation among group members plays a key role in the dynamic of how willing people will be to conform.&lt;ref name="Aaronson2"/&gt;{{rp|27}} Conformity is usually viewed as a negative tendency in American culture, but a certain amount of conformity is adaptive in some situations, as is nonconformity in other situations.&lt;ref name=Aaronson2&gt;

[[File:Asch experiment.png|thumb|left|Which line matches the first line, A, B, or C? In the [[Asch conformity experiments]], people frequently followed the majority judgment, even when the majority was (objectively) wrong.]]

The second major area of social influence research is compliance. [[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]] refers to any change in behavior that is due to a request or suggestion from another person. The [[foot-in-the-door technique]] is a compliance method in which the persuader requests a small favor and then follows up with requesting a larger favor, e.g., asking for the time and then asking for ten dollars. A related trick is the [[bait and switch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=R.B|year=2000|title=Influence: Science and Practice|publisher=[[Allyn and Bacon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third major form of social influence is [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]; this is a change in behavior that is the result of a direct order or command from another person. Obedience as a form of compliance was dramatically highlighted by the [[Milgram study]], wherein people were ready to administer shocks to a person in distress on a researcher's command.&lt;ref name=Aaronson2/&gt;{{rp|41}}

An unusual kind of social influence is the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]]. This is a prediction that, in being made, actually causes itself to become true. For example, in the [[stock market]], if it is widely believed that a [[stock market crash|crash]] is imminent, investors may lose confidence, sell most of their stock, and thus actually cause the crash. Similarly, people may expect hostility in others and actually induce this hostility by their own behavior.&lt;ref name=Aaronson1/&gt;{{rp|18}}

===Group dynamics===
{{Main|Group dynamics}}
A [[Social group|group]] can be defined as two or more individuals that are connected to each another by [[interpersonal relationship|social relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forsyth|first=D.R|year=2006|title=Group dynamics|location=Belmont, CA|publisher=Thomson-Wadworth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups tend to interact, influence each other, and share a common identity. They have a number of emergent qualities that distinguish them from [[wikt:aggregate|aggregates]]:
* [[Norm (sociology)|Norms]]: Implicit rules and expectations for group members to follow, e.g. saying thank you, shaking hands.
* [[Role]]s: Implicit rules and expectations for specific members within the group, e.g. the oldest sibling, who may have additional responsibilities in the family.
* [[Interpersonal relationship|Relations]]: Patterns of liking within the group, and also differences in prestige or status, e.g., leaders, popular people.
Temporary groups and aggregates share few or none of these features, and do not qualify as true social groups. People waiting in line to get on a bus, for example, do not constitute a group.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Groups are important not only because they offer social support, resources, and a feeling of belonging, but because they supplement an individual's self-concept. To a large extent, humans define themselves by the group memberships which form their [[social identity]]. The shared social identity of individuals within a group influences intergroup behavior, the way in which groups behave towards and perceive each other. These perceptions and behaviors in turn define the social identity of individuals within the interacting groups. The tendency to define oneself by membership in a group may lead to intergroup discrimination, which involves favorable perceptions and behaviors directed towards the in-group, but negative perceptions and behaviors directed towards the out-group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Tajfel|first1=H|last2=Turner|first2=J.C|year=1986|title=The social identity theory of intergroup behavior|editor1-first=S|editor1-last=Worchel|editor2-first=W.G|editor2-last=Austin|encyclopedia=Psychology of Intergroup Relations|location=Chicago, Illinois|publisher=Nelson-Hall}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, such discrimination and segregation may sometimes exist partly to facilitate a diversity which strengthens society.&lt;ref name=Haidt2003&gt;{{cite journal | last = Haidt | first = Jonathan  | last2 = Rosenberg | first2 = Evan | last3 = Hom | first3 = Holly | year = 2003 | title = Differentiating Diversities: Moral Diversity Is Not Like Other Kinds | journal = Journal of Applied Social Psychology | volume = 33 | issue =1 | pages = 1–36 | doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2003.tb02071.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intergroup discrimination leads to prejudice and stereotyping, while the processes of social facilitation and [[group polarization]] encourage extreme behaviors towards the out-group.

Groups often moderate and improve [[decision making]],{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} and are frequently relied upon for these benefits, such as in committees and juries. A number of group biases, however, can interfere with effective decision making. For example, group polarization, formerly known as the "risky shift," occurs when people polarize their views in a more extreme direction after group discussion. More problematic is the phenomenon of [[groupthink]]. This is a collective thinking defect that is characterized by a premature consensus or an incorrect assumption of consensus, caused by members of a group failing to promote views which are not consistent with the views of other members. Groupthink occurs in a variety of situations, including isolation of a group and the presence of a highly directive leader. Janis offered the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] as a historical case of groupthink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Janis|first=I.L|year=1972|title=Victims of Groupthink|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups also affect performance and [[productivity]]. Social facilitation, for example, is a tendency to work harder and faster in the presence of others. Social facilitation increases the ''[[dominant response]]''{{'}}s likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In contrast, [[social loafing]] is the tendency of individuals to [[slacker|slack off]] when working in a group. Social loafing is common when the task is considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spring.org.uk/2009/05/social-loafing-when-groups-are-bad-for-productivity.php PsyBlog], "Social Loafing: when groups are bad for productivity," 19 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=March 2012}}

Social psychologists study group-related (collective) phenomena such as the behavior of [[crowd]]s. An important concept in this area is [[deindividuation]], a reduced state of [[self-awareness]] that can be caused by feelings of anonymity. Deindividuation is associated with uninhibited and sometimes dangerous behavior. It is common in crowds and mobs, but it can also be caused by a disguise, a uniform, alcohol, dark environments, or online anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron, R.S., &amp; Kerr, N. L.|title=Group Process, Group Decision, Group Action|date=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;In the online domain, e.g., see Rosen, L.

[[File:Soc-psy diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Social psychologists study interactions within [[social group|groups]], and between both groups and individuals.]]

===Interpersonal attraction===
{{Main|Interpersonal attraction}}
A major area in the study of people's relations to each other is interpersonal attraction. This refers to all forces that lead people to like each other, establish relationships, and (in some cases) fall in [[love]]. Several general principles of attraction have been discovered by social psychologists, but many still continue to experiment and do research to find out more.  One of the most important factors in interpersonal attraction is how similar two particular people are.  The more similar two people are in general attitudes, backgrounds, environments, worldviews, and other traits, the more probable an attraction is possible.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, D. (1961). ''[[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]''. ''62''. pp. 713–715. "Thus Interpersonal attraction and attitude similarity have a direct correlation.  More so than those with dissimilar attitudes and views, who tend to not be as successful in the attraction department."&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Physical attractiveness]] is an important element of romantic relationships, particularly in the early stages characterized by high levels of [[limerence|passion]]. Later on, similarity and other compatibility factors become more important, and the type of love people experience shifts from ''passionate'' to ''companionate''. [[Robert Sternberg]] has suggested that there are actually three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J|authorlink=Robert Sternberg|year=1986|title=A Triangular Theory of Love|journal=[[Psychological Review]]|volume=93|pages=119–135|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.119|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; When two (or more) people experience all three, they are said to be in a state of consummate love.

According to [[social exchange theory]], relationships are based on rational choice and cost-benefit analysis. If one partner's costs begin to outweigh their benefits, that person may leave the relationship, especially if there are good alternatives available. This theory is similar to the [[minimax principle]] proposed by mathematicians and economists (despite the fact that human relationships are not [[zero-sum game]]s). With time, long term relationships tend to become communal rather than simply based on exchange.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Research==

===Methods===
Social psychology is an [[empirical]] science that attempts to answer questions about human behavior by testing hypotheses, both in the laboratory and in the field. Careful attention to sampling, research design, and [[statistics|statistical analysis]] is important; results are published in peer reviewed journals such as the ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]'', ''[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]]'' and the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]''. Social psychology studies also appear in general science journals such as ''[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.

[[Experiment|Experimental methods]] involve the researcher altering a variable in the environment and measuring the effect on another variable. An example would be allowing two groups of children to play violent or nonviolent videogames, and then observing their subsequent level of aggression during free-play period. A valid experiment is controlled and uses [[random assignment]].

[[Correlation|Correlational methods]] examine the statistical association between two naturally occurring variables. For example, one could correlate the amount of violent television children watch at home with the number of violent incidents the children participate in at school. Note that this study would ''not'' prove that violent TV causes aggression in children: it is quite possible that aggressive children choose to watch more violent TV.

[[Observation|Observational methods]] are purely descriptive and include [[naturalistic observation]], "contrived" observation, participant observation, and archival analysis. These are less common in social psychology but are sometimes used when first investigating a phenomenon. An example would be to unobtrusively observe children on a playground (with a videocamera, perhaps) and record the number and types of aggressive actions displayed.

Whenever possible, social psychologists rely on controlled experimentation. Controlled experiments require the manipulation of one or more [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variables]] in order to examine the effect on a [[Dependent and independent variables|dependent variable]]. Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in [[internal validity]], meaning that they are free from the influence of [[confounding]] or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship. However, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in [[external validity]], or the degree to which the results can be generalized to the larger population. There is usually a trade-off between experimental control ([[internal validity]]) and being able to generalize to the population ([[external validity]]).

Because it is usually impossible to test everyone, research tends to be conducted on a [[Sample (statistics)|sample]] of persons from the wider [[population]]. Social psychologists frequently use [[Statistical survey|survey]] research when they are interested in results that are high in external validity. Surveys use various forms of [[Sampling (statistics)|random sampling]] to obtain a sample of respondents that are representative of a population. This type of research is usually descriptive or correlational because there is no experimental control over variables. However, new statistical methods like [[structural equation modeling]] are being used to test for potential causal relationships in this type of data.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Some psychologists, including Dr. [[David O. Sears]], have criticized social psychological research for relying too heavily on studies conducted on university undergraduates in academic settings. Over 70% of experiments in Sears' study used North American undergraduates as subjects, a subset of the population that may not be representative of the population as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sears|first=David|year=1986|title=College Sophomores in the Laboratory: Influences of a Narrow Data Base on Social Psychology's View of Human Nature|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=515–530|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.3.515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of which method has been chosen to be used, the results are of high importance. Results need to be used to evaluate the hypothesis of the research that is done. These results should either confirm or reject the original hypothesis that was predicted.There are two different types of testing social psychologists use in order to test their results. Statistics and probability testing define a [[Statistical significance|significant]] finding that can be as low as 5% or less, likely to be due to chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/social-psychology/ | title=Social Psychology: Definition, History, Methods, Applications - IResearchNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reproducibility|Replications]] are important, to ensure that the result is valid and not due to chance, or some feature of a particular sample. [[False positive]] conclusions, often resulting from the [[Publish or perish|pressure to publish]] or the author's own [[confirmation bias]], are a hazard in the field.&lt;ref name="Simmons et al. (2011)"&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Simmons| first1 = Joseph|first2 = Leif|last2=Nelson|first3=Uri|last3=Simonsohn| title = False-Positive Psychology: Undisclosed Flexibility in Data Collection and Analysis Allows Presenting Anything as Significant| journal = [[Psychological Science]]| volume = 22| issue = 11| pages = 1359–1366| date = November 2011| url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/22/11/1359.full| issn = 0956-7976| doi = 10.1177/0956797611417632| accessdate =29 January 2012| pmid=22006061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
The goal of social psychology is to understand cognition and behavior as they naturally occur in a social context, but the very act of observing people can influence and alter their behavior. For this reason, many social psychology experiments utilize [[deception]] to conceal or distort certain aspects of the study. Deception may include false cover stories, false participants (known as confederates or stooges), false feedback given to the participants, and so on.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=What about concealment of the existence or purpose of observation?}}

The practice of deception has been challenged by some psychologists who maintain that deception under any circumstances is unethical, and that other research strategies (e.g., [[role-playing]]) should be used instead. Unfortunately, research has shown that role-playing studies do not produce the same results as deception studies and this has cast doubt on their validity.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} In addition to deception, experimenters have at times put people into potentially uncomfortable or embarrassing situations (e.g., the [[Milgram experiment]] and [[Stanford prison experiment]]), and this has also been criticized for ethical reasons.

To protect the rights and well-being of research participants, and at the same time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an [[ethics|ethical]] review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or [[Institutional Review Board]]. This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to be done to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study.

Furthermore, a process of [[informed consent]] is often used to make sure that volunteers know what will happen in the experiment{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=How, if there will be portions of the experiment that involve deception?}} and understand that they are allowed to quit the experiment at any time. A [[debriefing]] is typically done at the experiment's conclusion in order to reveal any deceptions used and generally make sure that the participants are unharmed by the procedures.{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=And what would the response be if they weren't? I would assume offering of psychological counseling...}} Today, most research in social psychology involves no more risk of harm than can be expected from routine psychological testing or normal daily activities.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/ed/precollege/undergrad/ptacc/irb-college-guide.pdf|title=THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB): A COLLEGE PLANNING GUIDE|last=COMMITTEE ON ASSOCIATE AND BACCALAUREATE EDUCATION|date=2009|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replication crisis===
{{main|replication crisis}}
Social psychology has recently found itself at the center of a "[[replication crisis]]" due to some research findings proving difficult to replicate.  Replication failures are not unique to social psychology and are found in all fields of science.  However, several factors have combined to put social psychology at the center of the current controversy.

Firstly, [[questionable research practices]] (QRP) have been identified as common in the field.  Such practices, while not necessarily intentionally fraudulent, involve converting undesired statistical outcomes into desired outcomes via the manipulation of statistical analyses, sample size or data management, typically to convert non-significant findings into significant ones.&lt;ref name="Simmons et al. (2011)"/&gt;  Some studies have suggested that at least mild versions of QRP are highly prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/questionable-research-practices-surprisingly-common.html|title=Questionable Research Practices Surprisingly Common|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the critics of Daryl Bem in the [[Daryl Bem#.22Feeling the Future.22 controversy|feeling the future controversy]] has suggested that the evidence for precognition in this study could (at least in part) be attributed to QRP.

Secondly, social psychology has found itself at the center of several recent scandals involving outright fraudulent research.  Most notably the admitted data fabrication by [[Diederik Stapel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/As-Dutch-Research-Scandal/129746/|title=Fraud Scandal Fuels Debate Over Practices of Social Psychology: Even legitimate researchers cut corners, some admit|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|first=Christopher|last=Shea|date=13 November 2011|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as allegations against others.  However, most scholars acknowledge that fraud is, perhaps, the lesser contribution to replication crises.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Third, several effects in social psychology have been found to be difficult to replicate even before the current replication crisis. For example, the scientific journal ''[[Society for Judgment and Decision Making#Publications and journal|Judgment and Decision Making]]'' has published several studies over the years that fail to provide support for the [[unconscious thought theory]]. Replications appear particularly difficult when research trials are pre-registered and conducted by research groups not highly invested in the theory under questioning.

These three elements together have resulted in renewed attention for replication supported by [[Daniel Kahneman]]. Scrutiny of many effects have shown that several core beliefs are hard to replicate. A recent special edition of the journal Social Psychology focused on replication studies and a number of previously held beliefs were found to be difficult to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.is/20140530230728/http://www.psycontent.com/content/l67413865317/?p=3f8268e0307f4036906c158b1667c57a&amp;pi=0 | title=Social Psychology - Volume 45, Number 3 / 2014 - Hogrefe Publishing| date=2014-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 special edition of the journal ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'' also focused on issues ranging from publication bias to null-aversion that contribute to the replication crises in psychology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6.toc|title=Table of Contents: Volume 7, Issue 6, November 2012|work=Perspectives on Psychological Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to note that this replication crisis does not mean that social psychology is unscientific.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Rather this process is a healthy if sometimes acrimonious part of the scientific process in which old ideas or those that cannot withstand careful scrutiny are pruned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/may/28/psychology-replication-drive-methods-bullying|title=Psychology's replication drive: it's not about you|journal=The Guardian|first=Pete|last=Etchells|date=28 May 2014|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The consequence is that some areas of social psychology once considered solid, such as social priming, have come under increased scrutiny due to failed replications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Power-of-Suggestion/136907/|title=Power of Suggestion|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|first=Tom|last=Bartlett|date=30 January 2013|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Famous experiments===
[[File:Milgram experiment v2.svg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Milgram experiment]]: The experimenter (E) persuades the participant (T) to give what the participant believes are painful electric shocks to another participant (L), who is actually an actor. Many participants continued to give shocks despite pleas for mercy from the actor.]]

The [[Asch conformity experiments]] demonstrated the power of conformity in small groups with a line length estimation task that was designed to be extremely easy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asch|first=S.E|year=1955|title=Opinions and social pressure|journal=[[Scientific American]]|pages=31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; In well over a third of the trials, participants conformed to the majority, who had been instructed to provide incorrect answers, even though the majority judgment was clearly wrong. Seventy-five percent of the participants conformed at least once during the experiment.  Additional manipulations to the experiment showed participant conformity decreased when at least one other individual failed to conform, but increased when the individual began conforming or withdrew from the experiment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Also, participant conformity increased substantially as the number of incorrect individuals increased from one to three, and remained high as the incorrect majority grew.  Participants with three incorrect opponents made mistakes 31.8% of the time, while those with one or two incorrect opponents made mistakes only 3.6% and 13.6% of the time, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Muzafer Sherif]]'s  [[Robbers' Cave Experiment]] divided boys into two competing groups to explore how much hostility and aggression would emerge. Sherif's explanation of the results became known as realistic group conflict theory, because the intergroup conflict was induced through competition over resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherif|first=Muzafer|authorlink=Muzafer Sherif|year=1954|title=Experiments in group conflict|journal=Scientific American|volume=195|issue=5|pages=54–58|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1156-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inducing cooperation and [[superordinate goals]] later reversed this effect.

In [[Leon Festinger]]'s cognitive dissonance experiment, participants were asked to perform a boring task. They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales. At the study's end, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 to say the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provides a reason for doing the boring task, therefore no dissonance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html|title=Cognitive Dissonance Theory - Simply Psychology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Festinger|first1=Leon|last2=Carlsmith|first2=J.M|year=1959|title= Cognitive consequences of forced compliance|journal=[[Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology]]|volume=58|pages=203–211|doi=10.1037/h0041593|issue=2|citeseerx=10.1.1.497.2779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable experiments in social psychology was the [[Milgram experiment]], which studied how far people would go to obey an [[authority]] figure. Following the events of [[The Holocaust]] in World War II, the experiment showed that (most) normal American citizens were capable of following orders from an authority even when they believed they were causing an innocent person to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Stanley|last=Milgram|year=1975|title=Obedience to authority|publisher=Harper and Bros}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Bandura]]'s [[Bobo doll experiment]] demonstrated how aggression is learned by [[imitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bandura|first1=Albert|last2=Ross|first2=D|last3=Ross|first3=S.A|year=1961|title=Transmission of aggression through imitation of aggressive models|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=63|pages=575–582|doi=10.1037/h0045925|pmid=13864605|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of studies fueled debates regarding [[media violence]] which continue to be waged among scholars.

In the [[Stanford prison study]], by [[Philip Zimbardo]], a simulated exercise between student prisoners and guards showed how far people would follow an adopted role. In just a few days, the "guards" became brutal and cruel, and the prisoners became miserable and compliant. This was initially argued to be an important demonstration of the power of the immediate social situation and its capacity to overwhelm normal personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haney|first1=C|last2=Banks|first2=W.C|last3=Zimbardo|first3=Philip G|year=1973|title=Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison|journal=International Journal of Criminology and Penology|volume=1|pages=69–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to this day, it remains a matter of contention what conclusions may be drawn from this study. For example, it has been pointed out that participant self-selection may have affected the participants' behaviour,&lt;ref name=revisitingSFE&gt;{{Cite journal

A '''spoolbase''' is a shore-based facility used to facilitate [[continuous pipe laying]] for offshore [[oil industry|oil and gas production]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Metallurgist and materials technologist'', Institution of Metallurgists (Great Britain), 1980, Vol 12, p.491&lt;/ref&gt; The facility allows the welding of single or double joints (40' or 80') of steel pipe of 4" to 18" diameter, into predetermined lengths for spooling onto a [[reel lay vessel]].

Shore based spoolbases serve the oil and gas sector from locations in the USA, UK, Norway, Brazil, and Angola, and portable spoolbases may be set up in any location to suit local requirements.

The '''technology adoption lifecycle''' is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical [[normal distribution]] or "bell curve". The model indicates that the first group of people to use a new product is called "[[innovators]]", followed by "[[early adopters]]". Next come the '''early majority''' and '''late majority''', and the last group to eventually adopt a product are called "Laggards" or "phobics." For example, a phobic may only use a cloud service when it is the only remaining method of performing a required task, but the phobic may not have an in-depth technical knowledge of how to use the service.

The [[demographic]] and [[psychological]] (or "[[psychographic]]") profiles of each adoption group were originally specified by the North Central Rural Sociology Committee, Subcommittee for the Study of the Diffusion of Farm Practices, by agricultural researchers Beal and Bohlen in 1957.&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
The report summarized the categories as:&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957/&gt;
* [[innovators]] – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented
* [[early adopter]]s – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous
* early majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours
* late majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active
* laggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated

The model has subsequently been adapted for many areas of technology adoption in the late 20th century.

==Adaptations of the model==
The model has spawned a range of adaptations that extend the concept or apply it to specific domains of interest.

In his book ''[[Crossing the Chasm]]'', [[Geoffrey Moore]] proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. He suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (innovators/early adopters), and the vertical markets.

Disruption as it is used today are of the [[Clayton M. Christensen]] variety. These disruptions are not s-curve based. 

In [[educational technology]], Lindy McKeown has provided a similar model (a pencil metaphor&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm Pencil metaphor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128192012/http://www.teachers.ash.org.au/lindy/pencil/pencil.htm |date=2007-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) describing the [[Information and Communications Technology|ICT]] uptake in education. In [[medical sociology]], Carl May has proposed [[normalization process theory]] that shows how technologies become embedded and integrated in health care and other kinds of organisation.

Wenger, White and Smith, in their book ''Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities'', talk of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.&lt;ref&gt; Rayna, Thierry, Striukova, Ludmila and Landau, Samuel, Crossing the Chasm or Being Crossed Out: The Case of Digital Audio Players (March 7, 2009). International Journal of Actor-Network Theory and Technological Innovation, Vol. 1, No. 3, pp. 36-54, July-September 2009. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1392691&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
One way to model product adoption&lt;ref&gt;Von Ahn, Luis. (2008) [http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures/lecture04.pdf Science of the Web] lectures at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; is to understand that people's behaviours are influenced by their peers and how widespread they think a particular action is. For many format-dependent technologies, people have a non-zero payoff for adopting the same technology as their closest friends or colleagues. If two users both adopt product A, they might get a payoff ''a''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0; if they adopt product B, they get ''b''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. But if one adopts A and the other adopts B, they both get a payoff of&amp;nbsp;0.

A threshold can be set for each user to adopt a product. Say that a node v in a graph has d neighbors: then v will adopt product A if a fraction p of its neighbors is greater than or equal to some threshold. For example, if v's threshold is 2/3, and only one of its two neighbors adopts product A, then v will not adopt A. Using this model, we can deterministically model product adoption on sample networks.

==History==
The technology adoption lifecycle is a [[sociological]] model that is an extension of an earlier model called ''the diffusion process'', which was originally published in 1957 by Joe M. Bohlen, George M. Beal and [[Everett M. Rogers]] at [[Iowa State University]] and which was originally published only for its application to [[agriculture]] and [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=BohlenBeal957&gt;{{cite journal

building on earlier research conducted there by Neal C. Gross and Bryce Ryan.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Neal C. (1942) ''The diffusion of a culture trait in two Iowa townships''. M.S. Thesis, Iowa State College, Ames.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bryce, and Neal C. Gross (1943) “The diffusion of hybrid seed corn in two Iowa communities.” ''Rural Sociology'' 8: 15–24. RS(E)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Bryce, and Neal C. Gross (1950) ''Acceptance and diffusion of hybrid corn seed in two Iowa communities''. Research Bulletin 372, Agricultural Experiment Station, Ames, Iowa.&lt;/ref&gt; Their original purpose was to track the purchase patterns of hybrid seed corn by farmers.

Beal, Rogers and Bohlen together developed a model called ''the diffusion process''&lt;ref&gt;Beal, George M., Everett M. Rogers, and Joe M. Bohlen (1957) "Validity of the concept of stages in the adoption process." ''Rural Sociology'' 22(2):166–168.&lt;/ref&gt; and later, Everett Rogers generalized the use of it in his widely acclaimed book 1962 ''[[Diffusion of innovations|Diffusion of Innovations]]''&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Everett M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovations'', Glencoe: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; (now in its fifth edition{{cn|date=November 2016}}), describing how new ideas and technologies spread in different cultures. Others have since used the model to describe how innovations spread between states in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, Robert L. (1985).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5926">'''Tire-derived fuel''' (TDF) is composed of shredded [[scrap tire]]s. Tires may be mixed with [[coal]] or other fuels, such as wood or chemical wastes, to be burned in [[Cement kiln|concrete kilns]], [[power plant]]s, or [[paper mill]]s. An [[EPA]] test program concluded that, with the exception of [[zinc]] [[pollutant|emissions]], potential emissions from TDF are not expected to be very much different from other conventional fossil fuels, as long as [[combustion]] occurs in a well-designed, well-operated
and well-maintained combustion device.&lt;ref name="EPA Air Emissions from Scrap Tire Combustion"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ttncatc1/dir1/tire_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Historically, there has not been any volume use for scrap tires other than burning that has been able to keep up with the volume of waste generated yearly. Tires produce the same [[Energy density|energy]] as [[petroleum]] and approximately 25% more energy than coal. Burning tires is lower on the hierarchy of reducing waste than [[recycling]], but it is better than placing the tire waste in a [[landfill]] or dump, where there is a possibility for uncontrolled tire fires or the harboring of disease vectors such as mosquitoes.&lt;ref name=tires&gt;http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/muncpl/tires/tdf.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
Tire Derived Fuel is an interim solution to the scrap tire waste problem. Advances in [[tire recycling]] technology&lt;ref&gt;http://news.discovery.com/tech/tech-to-end-tire-burning.html&lt;/ref&gt; might one day provide a solution other than burning by reusing tire derived material in high volume applications.

==Characteristics==
Tire derived fuel is usually consumed in the form of shredded or chipped material with most of the metal wire from the tire's steel belts removed. The analytical properties of this refined material are published in TDF Produced From Scrap Tires with 96+% Wire Removed&lt;ref name="TDF Produced From Scrap Tires with 96+% Wire Removed"&gt;http://www.p2pays.org/ref/11/10504/html/usa/tdfdata.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Tires are typically composed of about 1 to 1.5% [[Zinc oxide]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncagr.gov/agronomi/pdffiles/rubber.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which is a well known component used in the manufacture of tires and is also toxic to aquatic and plant life. The chlorine content in tires is due primarily to the chlorinated butyl rubber liner that slows the leak rate of air. The [[Rubber Manufacturers Association]] (RMA) is a very good source for compositional data and other information on tires.
The use of TDF for heat production is controversial due to the possibility for toxin production. Reportedly, [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxins]] and [[furan]]s are produced during the combustion process and there is supportive evidence to suggest that this is true under some incineration conditions. Other toxins such as NOx, SOx and heavy metals are also produced, though whether these levels of toxins are higher or lower than conventional coal and oil fired incinerators is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energyjustice.net/tires/&lt;/ref&gt;

On one hand, some argue that it is better to use the energy stored in a tire than to put it in a landfill, in line with the waste hierarchy. On the other, it is difficult to justify introducing toxins into the atmosphere, and much energy can be saved by recycling the tires so that new ones do not need to be remanufactured from raw materials.

==Controversy==

While environmental controversy surrounding use of this fuel is wide and varied, the greatest supported evidence of toxicity comes from the presence of [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] and furans in the flue gases.  Zinc has also been found to dissolve into storm water, from shredded rubber, at acutely [[Aquatic toxicology|toxic levels for aquatic life]] and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection Field Study: www.ct.gov/dep/lib/dep/artificialturf/dep_artificial_turf_report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of dioxin and furan content&lt;ref name="study of dioxin and furan content"&gt;http://www.energyjustice.net/tires/#16&lt;/ref&gt; of stack gasses at a variety of [[cement mill]]s, [[paper mill]]s, boilers, and power plants conducted in the 1990s shows a wide and inconsistent variation in dioxin and furan output when fueled partially by TDF as compared to the same facilities powered by only coal. Some facilities added as little as 4% TDF and experienced as much as a 4,140% increase in dioxin and furan emsissions. Other facilities added as much as 30% TDF and experienced dioxin and furan emissions increases of only as much as 58%. Still other facilities used as much as 8% TDF and experienced a decrease of as much as 83% of dioxin and furan emissions. One facility conducted four tests with two tests resulting in decreased emissions and two resulting in increased emissions. Another facility also conducted four tests and had widely varying increases in emissions.&lt;ref name="EPA Air Emissions from Scrap Tire Combustion"/&gt;

A 2004 study of Tire rubber use in energy generation,&lt;ref name="Soil, Water, and Air Environmental Impact from Tire Rubber/Coal Fluidized-Bed Cocombustion"&gt;http://viewer.zoho.com/docs/sa7Pp {{Dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; deeply studies the environmental impact on soil, water, and air from combustion of waste rubber (TDF).

Alvarez research shows that huge [[polyaromatic]] emissions are generated from combustion of tire rubber, at a minimum, 2 orders of magnitude higher than coal alone.

The study concludes with, "atmospheric contamination dramatically increases when tire rubber is used as the fuel. Other different combustion variables compared to the ones used for coal combustion should be used to avoid atmospheric contamination by toxic, [[mutagenic]], and [[carcinogenic]] pollutants, as well as hot- [[gas cleaning]] systems and [[Carbon capture and storage|COx capture systems]]."

The '''Wandlebury Enigma''' refers to a number of suggested hypotheses about the purpose, function and decoration of [[Wandlebury Hill]].&lt;ref name="Hoppit1978"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt;

The first is the suggestion that an ancient hill figure had once been carved into the side of [[Wandlebury Hill]], similar to the [[Cerne Abbas Giant]]. This was thought to have been overgrown or effaced in the 18th century. The figure was first recorded by Bishop Joseph Hall in 1605 and later by others including William Cole and John Layer. Investigation  was carried out in 1954 by [[T. C. Lethbridge]], an [[archaeologist]] and [[parapsychologist]]. He found small lumps of chalk to the south of the hill and proceeded to survey the area with a sounding bar, probing areas of soft ground and disturbed chalk. By placing markers he was able to draw out the pattern of what he claimed were 3 hill figures picturing ancient [[United Kingdom|British]] deities - A [[horse]] Goddess ([[Magog (Bible)|Magog]] or [[Epona]]), a [[Sun]] God ([[Gog and Magog|Gog]], [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]], [[Belinus]] or [[Lucifer]]) and a warrior figure with sword and shield. [[The Times]] reported on Lethbridge's discovery as a "previously lost, three thousand-year-old hill-figure". A later article about Lethbridge's efforts was written by W.A. Clark in 1997 which did not confirm his claims, nor did magnometer and resistivity meter testing.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;Newman, Paul., Darvil, Tim., Lost Gods of Albion: The Chalk Hill Figures of Britain, pp. 114-125, The History Press, 2009 (earlier editions 1997, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; This suggestion was dismissed by [[Professor Glyn Daniel]] who commented that Lethbridge had not found any real antiquities but was "probably confusing geological features".&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt; A report by the [[Council for British Archaeology]] concluded that the 'hollows' were caused by common geological processes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/features/fortean_traveller/99/the_gog_magog_hills_uk.html Price, Simon., "The Gog Magog Hills"'''Fortean Times''' May 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another [[Wandlebury]] Enigma dismissed by Glyn Daniel that was featured in a 1978 ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' article is the ''Line A Loxodrome'' or ''[[River Cam|Cam Valley]] Loxodrome'',  a series of what retired geologist [[Christian O'Brien]] considered to be hand-carved stone [[monolith]] markers placed 1,430 metres apart between [[Wandlebury Earthworks]] and [[Portingbury Hills]] Mound&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63851|title=A History of the County of Essex: Volume 8|author=W. R. Powell|publisher=[[Victoria County History]]|date=1983}}{{failed verification|reason=the linked page does not mention any of the words "Wandlebury", "Brien", "Loxodrome", and its description of Portingbury Hills does not mention these markers|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Hatfield Broad Oak]], in [[Hatfield Forest]]. O'Brien stated that eleven of the original twenty-six stones are still in situ, with several others lying nearby. According to O'Brien local records indicate that at least one was moved due to it impeding modern agriculture.&lt;ref name="Hoppit1978"&gt;{{cite news | first = David | last = Hoppit | title = The Wandlebury Enigma Solved? - Line A Loxodrome | date = 18 March 1978 | work = Sunday Telegraph Magazine |issue=78 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names suggested for the stones featured include the Wandlebury Stone, Great Chesterfield Stone, Bordeaux Stone, Wendens Ambow Stone, Shortgrove Monolith, Newport Stone (also known as The [[Leper Stone]]), Springfield Stone, and the Priory Stone. The line forms a perfect [[rhumb line]], so that wherever an observer stands on the line between Wandlebury and Portingbury, the [[North Star]] is always at the same oblique angle. Based upon this alignment, O'Brien believed that the line's builders possessed knowledge that [[the Earth]] was round, and also of its approximate [[circumference]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tX_vAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=wandlebury+o'brien&amp;dq=wandlebury+o'brien&amp;hl=en Wilson, Colin., Starseekers, [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Brien believed it to have been created in the [[Bronze Age]].

O'Brien was following up a suggestion put forward by [[Alfred Watkins]] that the Wandlebury bank had astronomical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forteantimes.com/features/fortean_traveller/99/the_gog_magog_hills_uk.html Price, Simon., "The Gog Magog Hills" '''Fortean Times''' May 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; According to O'Brien dents point from its exact centre to the North Star, the midsummer sunrise and the lunar summer maximum, he suggested probabilities for this and the markers being in the correct locations by pure chance were in the order of 10 million to one. By factoring in the Earth's drift, O'Brien placed the date of its construction around 2,500 [[Before Christ|BC]]. His hypothesis met with mixed comments. Interviewed by the Sunday Telegraph, Glyn Daniel, Professor of Archaeology at [[Cambridge University]] dismissed the paper as "nonsense" and could find nothing in it to revise the documented view of Wandlebury.  Archie Roy, Professor of Astronomy at [[Glasgow University]] commented that "in the absence of a more convincing explanation, this conclusion also has to be taken very seriously.” [[Alexander Thom]] stated that he believed it to be only an [[Iron Age]] Hill Fort.&lt;ref name="Hoppit1978" /&gt;
