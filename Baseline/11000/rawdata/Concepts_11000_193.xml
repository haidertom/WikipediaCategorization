In law, '''acquiescence''' occurs when a person knowingly stands by without raising any objection to the infringement of his or her rights, while someone else unknowingly and without [[malice aforethought]] acts in a manner inconsistent with their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acquiescence|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/acquiescence|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of acquiescence, the person whose rights are infringed may lose the ability to make a legal claim against the infringer, or may be unable to obtain an [[injunction]] against continued infringement. The doctrine infers a form of "[[permission (philosophy)|permission]]" that results from silence or passiveness over an extended period of time.

==Overview==

Although not typically not found in statutory law, the doctrine of acquiescence is well-supported by case law. One common context in which acquiescence is raised is when there is a dispute or disagreement over the location of a property line, followed by an extended period of time during which the parties respect a property line. Even if it is later discovered that the actual property line was in a different location, the long-term acquiescence to the incorrectly placed line may result in its becoming enforceable as the legal property line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Acquiescence To A Boundary Line|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/real_estate/acquiescence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the law of acquiescence occurred in a dispute between the State of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and the State of [[South Carolina (U.S. state)|South Carolina]], in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that Georgia could no longer make any claim to an [[island]] in the [[Savannah River]], despite the 1787 [[Treaty of Beaufort]]'s assignment to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia v. South Carolina, 497 US 376, 110 S. Ct. 2903, 111 L. Ed. 2d 309 (1990)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14552846522715606367|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court said that Georgia had knowingly allowed South Carolina to join the island as a [[peninsula]] to its own coast by dumping sand from dredging, and to then levy [[property tax]]es on it for decades.  Georgia thereby lost the island-turned-peninsula by its own acquiescence, even though the [[treaty]] had given it all of the islands in the [[river]].

==Similar legal doctrines==

Doctrines similar to acquiescence include:

*The [[common law]] [[doctrine]] of '''[[estoppel]]'''. A claim of estoppel may arise when one party gives legal notice to a second party of a fact or claim, and the second party fails to challenge or refute that claim within a reasonable time. The second party may be said to have acquiesced to the claim, and thus to be ''estopped'' from later challenging it or making a counterclaim based upon the actions of the other party. Estoppel by acquiescence is different from estoppel by [[Laches (equity)|laches]] as acquiescence involves an intentional act of the party who is accused of acquiescence, while laches may result from conduct that is not voluntary.
*'''Silence is acquiescence''' (aka. '''silent acquiescence''' and '''acquiescence by silence'''). Under this related doctrine, when confronted with a wrong or an act that can be considered a [[tort]]ious act, one's silence in the face of the transgression may result in a loss of a right to make a claim for loss or damage, on the principle of consent inferred from accepting or permitting the wrongful acts without protest or [[claim (legal)|claim]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Central Pacific R. Co. v. Alameda County, 284 US 463, 52 S. Ct. 225, 76 L. Ed. 402 (1932)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17866206001274130168|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archetypal psychology''' was initiated as a distinct movement in the early 1970s by [[James Hillman]], a psychologist who trained in analytical psychology and became the first Director of the Jung Institute in Zurich. Hillman reports that archetypal psychology emerged partly from the [[Analytical psychology|Jungian tradition]] whilst drawing also from other traditions and authorities such as Henry Corbin, Vico and Plotinus.

Archetypal psychology relativizes and deliteralizes the notion of ego and focuses on what it calls the ''psyche'', or ''soul'', and the deepest patterns of psychic functioning, "the fundamental fantasies that animate all life" (Moore, in Hillman, 1991). Archetypal psychology likens itself to a polytheistic mythology in that it attempts to recognize the myriad fantasies and [[mythology|myths]] – gods, goddesses, demigods, mortals and animals – that shape and are shaped by our psychological lives. In this framework the ego is but one psychological fantasy within an assemblage of fantasies. Archetypal psychology is, along with the classical and developmental schools, one of the three schools of post-Jungian psychology outlined by [[Andrew Samuels]] (see Samuels, 1995).

==Influences==
The main influence on the development of archetypal psychology is [[Carl Jung]]'s [[analytical psychology]]. It is strongly influenced by [[Greek philosophy|Classical Greek]], [[Renaissance]], and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] ideas and thought. Influential artists, poets, philosophers and psychologists include: [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Henry Corbin]], [[John Keats|Keats]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Petrarch]], and [[Paracelsus]]. Though all different in their theories and psychologies, they appear to be unified by their common concern for the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] – the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].

==C. G. Jung==
Carl Gustav Jung was a Swiss psychologist who was the first father of archetypal psychology. [[Jungian archetypes]] are thought patterns that find worldwide parallels in individuals or entire cultures. Archai appear in dreams, religions, the arts, and social customs in all people and they manifest impulsively in mental disorders.&lt;ref name="Hillman, J. 1985"&gt;Hillman, J. (1985). Archetypal psychology a brief account. Dallas, TX: Spring Publications&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jung archetypal ideas and patterns reside within the [[collective unconscious]], which is a blueprint inherent in every individual, as opposed to the personal [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]], which contains a single individual's [[Psychological repression|repressed]] ideas, desires and memories as described by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]. What differentiates Jungian psychology from archetypal psychology is that Jung believed archetypes are cultural, anthropological, and transcend the empirical world of time and place, and are not phenomenal. On the contrary, Archetypal psychology views archetypes to always be phenomenal.&lt;ref name="Hillman, J. 1985"/&gt;

==Henry Corbin==
[[Henry Corbin]], a French scholar and philosopher, is the second father of archetypal psychology. Corbin created the idea of the existence of the ''mundus imaginalis'' which is a distinct field of imaginable realities and offers an [[ontological]] mode of location of archetypes of the psyche.{{clarify|what is meant by "an ontological mode of location of archetypes of the psyche"?|date=June 2013}} The mundus imaginalis provided an evaluative and cosmic grounding for archetypes. The second contribution Corbin made to the field was the idea that archetypes are accessible to imagination and first present themselves as images, so the procedure of archetypal psychology must be rhetorical and poetic, without logical reasoning, and the goal in therapy should be to restore the patient's imaginable realities. Therefore, the goal of therapy is the middle ground of psychic realities, a development of a sense of soul. Also, according to Corbin, the method of therapy is the cultivation of imagination.&lt;ref name="Hillman, J. 1985"/&gt;

==Edward Casey==
[[Edward S. Casey]] is attributed with distinguishing archetypal psychology from other theories by explaining an image as a way of seeing rather than something seen. According to Casey an image is only perceived by imagining because an image is not what one sees but the way one sees. He also states that imagination is an activity of soul and not just a human faculty. An image appears to be more profound, more powerful, and more beautiful than the comprehension of it. This explains the drive behind the arts which provide disciplines that can actualize the complexity of the image.&lt;ref name="Hillman, J. 1985"/&gt;

==James Hillman==

Hillman (1975) sketches a brief lineage of archetypal psychology.
:''By calling upon Jung to begin with, I am partly acknowledging the fundamental debt that archetypal psychology owes him. He is the immediate ancestor in a long line that stretches back through Freud, [[Wilhelm Dilthey|Dilthey]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling|Schelling]], [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]], [[Marsilio Ficino|Ficino]], [[Plotinus]], and [[Plato]] to [[Heraclitus]] – and with even more branches yet to be traced (p. xvii).''

===Polytheistic psychology===
Thomas Moore says of [[James Hillman]]'s teaching that he "portrays the psyche as inherently multiple".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillman|first=James|title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman.|year=1989|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-092101-3|pages=36|editor=Thomas Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hillman's archetypal/polytheistic view, the psyche or soul has many directions and sources of meaning – and this can feel like an ongoing state of conflict – a struggle with one's [[Daemon (mythology)|daimones]]. According to Hillman, "polytheistic psychology can give sacred differentiation to our psychic turmoil.…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hillman|first=James|title=A blue fire: Selected writings by James Hillman.|year=1989|publisher=Harper Collins|location=New York|isbn=0-06-092101-3|pages=41|editor=Thomas Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman states that
:The power of myth, its reality, resides precisely in its power to seize and influence psychic life. The Greeks knew this so well, and so they had no depth psychology and psychopathology such as we have. They had myths. And we have no myths – instead, depth psychology and psychopathology. Therefore... psychology shows myths in modern dress and myths show our depth psychology in ancient dress."&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, J. (1990) ''Oedipus Variations: Studies in Literature and Psychoanalysis''. Spring p.90&lt;/ref&gt;
Hillman qualifies his many references to gods as differing from a literalistic approach saying that for him they are ''aides memoires'', i.e. sounding boards employed "for echoing life today or as bass chords giving resonance to the little melodies of life."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;SPRING Journal 56, p.5 (1994) Spring Publications&lt;/ref&gt; Hillman further insists that he does not view the pantheon of gods as a 'master matrix' against which we should measure today and thereby decry modern loss of richness.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

===Psyche or soul===
{{Main|Psyche (psychology)|Soul}}
Hillman says he has been critical of the 20th century's psychologies (e.g. [[biological psychology]], [[behaviorism]], [[cognitive psychology]]) that have adopted a natural scientific philosophy and [[praxis (process)|praxis]]. His main criticisms include that they are reductive, materialistic, and literal; they are psychologies without psyche, without soul. Accordingly, Hillman's oeuvre has been an attempt to restore psyche to its proper place in psychology. Hillman sees the soul at work in imagination, fantasy, myth and metaphor. He also sees soul revealed in [[psychopathology]], in the symptoms of psychological disorders. Psyche-pathos-logos is the "speech of the suffering soul" or the soul's suffering of meaning. A great portion of Hillman's thought attempts to attend to the speech of the soul as it is revealed via images and fantasies.

Hillman has his own definition of soul. Primarily, he notes that soul is not a "thing", not an entity. Nor is it something that is located "inside" a person. Rather, soul is "a perspective rather than a substance, a viewpoint towards things… (it is) reflective; it mediates events and makes differences…"(1975). Soul is not to be located in the brain or in the head, for example (where most modern psychologies place it), but human beings are in psyche. The world, in turn, is the [[Anima mundi (spirit)|anima mundi]], or the world ensouled. Hillman often quotes a phrase coined by the Romantic poet John Keats: "call the world the vale of soul-making."

Additionally, Hillman (1975) says he observes that soul:
:refers to the deepening of events into experiences; second the significance of soul makes possible, whether in love or religious concern, derives from its special relationship with death. And third, by soul I mean the imaginative possibility in our natures the experiencing through reflective speculation, dream, image, fantasy&amp;mdash;that mode which recognizes all realities as primarily symbolic or metaphorical.

The notion of soul as imaginative possibility, in relation to the archai or root metaphors, is what Hillman has termed the "poetic basis of mind".

===Dream analysis===
{{Main|Dream analysis}}
Because Hillman's archetypal psychology is concerned with fantasy, myth, and image, it is not surprising that dreams are considered to be significant in relation to soul and soul-making. Hillman does not believe that dreams are simply random residue or flotsam from waking life (as advanced by physiologists), but neither does he believe that dreams are compensatory for the struggles of waking life, or are invested with "secret" meanings of how one should live (à la Jung). Rather, "dreams tell us where we are, not what to do" (1979). Therefore, Hillman is against the 20th century traditional interpretive methods of dream analysis. Hillman's approach is phenomenological rather than analytic (which breaks the dream down into its constituent parts) and interpretive/hermeneutic (which may make a dream image "something other" than what it appears to be in the dream). His dictum with regard to dream content and process is "Stick with the image."

Hillman  (1983) describes his position succinctly:
:For instance, a black snake comes in a dream, a great big black snake, and you can spend a whole hour with this black snake talking about the devouring mother, talking about anxiety, talking about the repressed sexuality, talking about the natural mind, all those interpretive moves that people make, and what is left, what is vitally important, is what this snake is doing, this crawling huge black snake that's walking into your life…and the moment you've defined the snake, you've interpreted it, you've lost the snake, you've stopped it.… The task of analysis is to keep the snake there.…

The snake in the dream does not become something else: it is none of the things Hillman mentioned, and neither is it a penis, as Hillman says Freud might have maintained, nor the serpent from the [[Garden of Eden]], as Hillman thinks Jung might have mentioned. It is not something someone can look up in a dream dictionary; its meaning has not been given in advance. Rather, the black snake is the black snake. Approaching the dream snake [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenologically]] simply means describing the snake and attending to how the snake appears as a snake in the dream. It is a huge black snake, that is given. But are there other snakes in the dream? If so, is it bigger than the other snakes? Smaller? Is it a black snake among green snakes? Or is it alone? What is the setting, a desert or a rain forest?  Is the snake getting ready to feed? Shedding its skin? Sunning itself on a rock? All of these questions are elicited from the primary image of the snake in the dream, and as such can be rich material revealing the psychological life of the dreamer and the life of the psyche spoken through the dream.

===''The Soul's Code''===
Hillman's book, ''The Soul's Code: In Search of Character and Calling'', outlines an "acorn theory of the soul." His theory states that each individual holds the potential for their unique possibilities inside themselves already, much as an acorn holds the pattern for an oak, invisible within itself. It argues against the parental fallacy whereby our parents are seen as crucial in determining who we are by supplying us with genetic material and behavioral patterns. Instead the book suggests for a reconnection with what is invisible within us, our [[daimon]] or [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or acorn and the acorn's calling to the wider world of nature. It argues against theories which attempt to map life into phases, suggesting that this is counter-productive and makes people feel like they are failing to live up to what is normal. This in turn produces a truncated, normalized society of soulless mediocrity where evil is not allowed but injustice is everywhere – a society that cannot tolerate eccentricity or the further reaches of life experiences but sees them as illnesses to be medicated out of existence.

Hillman diverges from Jung and his idea of the Self. Hillman sees Jung as too prescriptive and argues against the idea of life-maps by which to try to grow properly.

Instead, Hillman suggests a reappraisal of each individual's childhood and present life to try to find the individual's particular calling, the acorn of the soul. He has written that he is the one to help precipitate a re-souling of the world in the space between rationality and psychology. He replaces the notion of growing up, with the myth of growing down from the [[womb]] into a messy, confusing earthy world. Hillman rejects formal logic in favour of reference to case histories of well known people and considers his arguments to be in line with the  ''[[puer aeternus]]'' or eternal youth whose brief burning existence could be seen in the work of romantic poets like [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] and in recently deceased young rock stars like [[Jeff Buckley]] or [[Kurt Cobain]]. Hillman also rejects [[causality]] as a defining framework and suggests in its place a shifting form of fate whereby events are not inevitable but bound to be expressed in some way dependent on the character of the soul or acorn in question.

==Psychopathology and therapy==
Psychopathology is viewed as the psyche's independent ability to create morbidity, disorder, illness, abnormality and suffering in any part of its behavior and to imagine and experience life  through a deformed perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, James. Re-Visioning Psychology. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1975 [Harper Colophon edition, 1977].&lt;/ref&gt;

Archetypal psychology follows the following procedures for therapy:
*Regular meetings
*Face-to-face
*The therapist chooses the location
*A fee is charged
These procedures may be modified depending on the therapist and the client. In therapy both the therapist and client explore the client's  habitual behavior, feelings, fantasies, dreams, memories, and ideas. The goal of therapy is the improvement of the client and termination of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, James. Loose Ends: Primary Papers in Archetypal Psychology. New York/Zurich: Spring Publications, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Goals are not stated for therapy.&lt;ref name="Hillman, J. 1985"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26524">The '''base rate fallacy''', also called '''base rate neglect''' or '''base rate bias''', is a [[formal fallacy]]. If presented with related [[base rate]] information (i.e. generic, general information) and specific information (information pertaining only to a certain case), the mind tends to ignore the former and focus on the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fallacyfiles.org/baserate.html |title=Logical Fallacy: The Base Rate Fallacy |publisher=Fallacyfiles.org |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Base rate neglect is a specific form of the more general [[extension neglect]].

==False positive paradox==
One type of base rate fallacy is the '''false positive paradox''', where [[false positive]] tests are more probable than true positive tests, occurring when the overall population has a low incidence of a condition and the incidence rate is lower than the false positive rate.  The probability of a positive test result is determined not only by the accuracy of the test but by the characteristics of the sampled population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Probability and Statistics in Aerospace Engineering |first1= M.

The paradox has surprised many.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Assessing Mathematical Proficiency |editor1-first= A. H. |editor1-last= Schoenfeld  |first= B.

It is especially counter-intuitive when interpreting a positive result in a test on a low-incidence [[population (statistics)|population]] after having dealt with positive results drawn from a high-incidence population.&lt;ref name= "Vacher"/&gt; If the [[false positive]] rate of the test is higher than the proportion of the ''new'' population with the condition, then a test administrator whose experience has been drawn from testing in a high-incidence population may [[rule of thumb|conclude from experience]] that a positive test result usually indicates a positive subject, when in fact a false positive is far more likely to have occurred.

==Examples==
===Example 1: HIV===
==== High-incidence population ====
{| class="wikitable floatright" style="text-align:right;"
! Number&lt;br /&gt;of people !! Infected !! Uninfected !! Total
|-
! Test&lt;br /&gt;positive
| ''400''&lt;br /&gt;(true positive) || ''30''&lt;br /&gt;(false positive)
| 430
|-
! Test&lt;br /&gt;negative
| 0&lt;br /&gt;(false negative) || 570&lt;br /&gt;(true negative)
| 570
|-
! Total 
| 400 || 600 
! 1000
|}
Imagine running an HIV test on population ''A'' of 1000 persons, in which 40% are infected. The test has a false positive rate of 5% (0.05) and no false negative rate. The [[Expected_value#Examples|expected outcome]] of the 1000 tests on population ''A'' would be:

:Infected and test indicates disease ([[True_positive#Type_I_and_type_II_errors|true positive]])
::1000 × {{sfrac|40|100}} = 400 people would receive a true positive
:Uninfected and test indicates disease (false positive)
::1000 × {{sfrac|100 – 40|100}} × 0.05 = 30 people would receive a false positive
:The remaining 570 tests are correctly negative.

So, in population ''A'', a person receiving a positive test could be over 93% confident ({{sfrac|400|30 + 400}}) that it correctly indicates infection.

====Low-incidence population====
{| class="wikitable floatright" style="text-align:right;"
! Number&lt;br /&gt;of people !! Infected !! Uninfected !! Total
|-
! Test&lt;br /&gt;positive
| ''20''&lt;br /&gt;(true positive) || ''49''&lt;br /&gt;(false positive)
| 69
|-
! Test&lt;br /&gt;negative
| 0&lt;br /&gt;(false negative) || 931&lt;br /&gt;(true negative)
| 931
|-
! Total 
| 20 || 980 
! 1000
|}
Now consider the same test applied to population ''B'', in which only 2% is infected. The [[Expected_value#Examples|expected]] outcome of 1000 tests on population ''B'' would be:

:Infected and test indicates disease ([[True_positive#Type_I_and_type_II_errors|true positive]])
::1000 × {{sfrac|2|100}} = 20 people would receive a true positive
:Uninfected and test indicates disease (false positive)
::1000 × {{sfrac|100 – 2|100}} × 0.05 = 49 people would receive a false positive
:The remaining 931 (= 1000 - (49 + 20)) tests are correctly negative.

In population ''B'', only 20 of the 69 total people with a positive test result are actually infected. So, the probability of actually being infected after one is told that one is infected is only 29% ({{sfrac|20|20 + 49}}) for a test that otherwise appears to be "95% accurate".

A tester with experience of group ''A'' might find it a paradox that in group ''B'', a result that had usually correctly indicated infection is now usually a [[false positive]]. The confusion of the [[posterior probability]] of infection with the [[prior probability]] of receiving a false positive is a natural [[fallacy|error]] after receiving a life-threatening test result.

===Example 2: Drunk drivers===
: A group of police officers have [[breathalyzer]]s displaying false drunkenness in 5% of the cases in which the driver is sober. However, the breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person. One in a thousand drivers is driving drunk. Suppose the police officers then stop a driver at random, and force the driver to take a breathalyzer test. It indicates that the driver is drunk. We assume you don't know anything else about him or her. How high is the probability he or she really is drunk?

Many would answer as high as 95%, but the correct probability is about 2%.

An explanation for this is as follows: on average, for every 1,000 drivers tested,
* 1 driver is drunk, and it is 100% certain that for that driver there is a ''true'' positive test result, so there is 1 ''true'' positive test result
* 999 drivers are not drunk, and among those drivers there are 5% ''false'' positive test results, so there are 49.95 ''false'' positive test results
Therefore, the probability that one of the drivers among the 1 + 49.95 = 50.95 positive test results really is drunk is &lt;math&gt;1/50.95 \approx 0.019627&lt;/math&gt;.

The validity of this result does, however, hinge on the validity of the initial assumption that the police officer stopped the driver truly at random, and not because of bad driving. If that or another non-arbitrary reason for stopping the driver was present, then the calculation also involves the probability of a drunk driver driving competently and a non-drunk driver driving (in-)competently.

More formally, the same probability of roughly 0.02 can be established using [[Bayes's theorem]]. The goal is to find the probability that the driver is drunk given that the breathalyzer indicated he/she is drunk, which can be represented as 
:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathrm{drunk}\mid D)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''D'' means that the breathalyzer indicates that the driver is drunk. Bayes's theorem tells us that
:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathrm{drunk}\mid D) = \frac{p(D \mid \mathrm{drunk})\, p(\mathrm{drunk})}{p(D)}.&lt;/math&gt;
We were told the following in the first paragraph: 
:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathrm{drunk}) = 0.001,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathrm{sober}) = 0.999,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;p(D\mid\mathrm{drunk}) = 1.00,&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;p(D\mid\mathrm{sober}) = 0.05.&lt;/math&gt;
As you can see from the formula, one needs ''p''(''D'') for Bayes' theorem, which one can compute from the preceding values using the [[Law of total probability|law of total probability]]:
:&lt;math&gt;p(D) = p(D \mid \mathrm{drunk})\,p(\mathrm{drunk})+p(D\mid\mathrm{sober})\,p(\mathrm{sober})&lt;/math&gt;
which gives
:&lt;math&gt;p(D)= (1.00 \times 0.001) + (0.05 \times 0.999) = 0.05095.&lt;/math&gt;
Plugging these numbers into Bayes' theorem, one finds that
:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathrm{drunk}\mid D) = \frac{1.00 \times 0.001}{0.05095} = 0.019627.&lt;/math&gt;

===Example 3: Terrorist identification===
In a city of 1 million inhabitants let there be 100 terrorists and 999,900 non-terrorists. To simplify the example, it is assumed that all people present in the city are inhabitants. Thus, the base rate probability of a randomly selected inhabitant of the city being a terrorist is 0.0001, and the base rate probability of that same inhabitant being a non-terrorist is 0.9999. In an attempt to catch the terrorists, the city installs an alarm system with a surveillance camera and automatic facial recognition software.

The software has two failure rates of 1%:
* The false negative rate: If the camera scans a terrorist, a bell will ring 99% of the time, and it will fail to ring 1% of the time.
* The false positive rate: If the camera scans a non-terrorist, a bell will not ring 99% of the time, but it will ring 1% of the time.

Suppose now that an inhabitant triggers the alarm. What is the chance that the person is a terrorist? In other words, what is P(T | B), the probability that a terrorist has been detected given the ringing of the bell? Someone making the 'base rate fallacy' would infer that there is a 99% chance that the detected person is a terrorist. Although the inference seems to make sense, it is actually bad reasoning, and a calculation below will show that the chances he/she is a terrorist are actually near 1%, not near 99%.

The fallacy arises from confusing the natures of two different failure rates. The 'number of non-bells per 100 terrorists' and the 'number of non-terrorists per 100 bells' are unrelated quantities. One does not necessarily equal the other, and they don't even have to be almost equal. To show this, consider what happens if an identical alarm system were set up in a second city with no terrorists at all. As in the first city, the alarm sounds for 1 out of every 100 non-terrorist inhabitants detected, but unlike in the first city, the alarm never sounds for a terrorist. Therefore, 100% of all occasions of the alarm sounding are for non-terrorists, but a false negative rate cannot even be calculated. The 'number of non-terrorists per 100 bells' in that city is 100, yet P(T | B) = 0%. There is zero chance that a terrorist has been detected given the ringing of the bell.

Imagine that the first city's entire population of one million people pass in front of the camera. About 99 of the 100 terrorists will trigger the alarm—and so will about 9,999 of the 999,900 non-terrorists. Therefore, about 10,098 people will trigger the alarm, among which about 99 will be terrorists. So, the probability that a person triggering the alarm actually is a terrorist, is only about 99 in 10,098, which is less than 1%, and very, very far below our initial guess of 99%.

The base rate fallacy is so misleading in this example because there are many more non-terrorists than terrorists, and the number of false positives (non-terrorists scanned as terrorists) is so much larger than the true positives (the real number of terrorists).

==Findings in psychology==
In experiments, people have been found to prefer individuating information over general information when the former is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bar-Hillel|first=Maya|title=The base-rate fallacy in probability judgments|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=1980|volume=44|pages=211–233|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(80)90046-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kv1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases|year=1985|pages=153–160|author2=Amos Tversky|editor=Daniel Kahneman, Paul Slovic &amp; Amos Tversky (Eds.)|chapter=Evidential impact of base rates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some experiments, students were asked to estimate the [[grade point average]]s (GPAs) of hypothetical students. When given relevant statistics about GPA distribution, students tended to ignore them if given descriptive information about the particular student even if the new descriptive information was obviously of little or no relevance to school performance.&lt;ref name="kv1"/&gt; This finding has been used to argue that interviews are an unnecessary part of the [[college admissions]] process because interviewers are unable to pick successful candidates better than basic statistics.

[[Psychologist]]s [[Daniel Kahneman]] and [[Amos Tversky]] attempted to explain this finding in terms of a [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|simple rule or "heuristic"]] called [[representativeness heuristic|representativeness]]. They argued that many judgments relating to likelihood, or to cause and effect, are based on how representative one thing is of another, or of a category.&lt;ref name="kv1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|author2=Amos Tversky|title=On the psychology of prediction|journal=Psychological Review|year=1973|volume=80|pages=237–251|doi=10.1037/h0034747}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahneman considers base rate neglect to be a specific form of [[extension neglect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|title=Choices, Values and Frames|year=2000|editor=Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (Eds.)|chapter=Evaluation by moments, past and future}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Nisbett]] has argued that some [[attributional bias]]es like the [[fundamental attribution error]] are instances of the base rate fallacy: people do not use the "consensus information" (the "base rate") about how others behaved in similar situations and instead prefer simpler [[dispositional attribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nisbett|first=Richard E.|title=Cognition and social behavior|year=1976 |author2=E.

There is considerable debate in psychology on the conditions under which people do or do not appreciate base rate information.&lt;ref name="Koehler1996"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Koehler | first1 = J.

Consider again Example 1 from above. The required inference is to estimate the (posterior) probability that a (randomly picked) driver is drunk, given that the breathalyzer test is positive. Formally, this probability can be calculated using [[Bayes' theorem]], as shown above. However, there are different ways of presenting the relevant information. Consider the following, formally equivalent variant of the problem:

: &amp;nbsp;1 out of 1000 drivers are driving drunk. The breathalyzers never fail to detect a truly drunk person. For 50 out of the 999 drivers who are not drunk the breathalyzer falsely displays drunkness. Suppose the policemen then stop a driver at random, and force them to take a breathalyzer test. It indicates that he or she is drunk. We assume you don't know anything else about him or her. How high is the probability he or she really is drunk?

In this case, the relevant numerical information—''p''(drunk), ''p''(''D'' | drunk), ''p''(''D'' | sober)—is presented in terms of natural frequencies with respect to a certain reference class (see [[reference class problem]]). Empirical studies show that people's inferences correspond more closely to Bayes' rule when information is presented this way, helping to overcome base-rate neglect in laypeople&lt;ref name="GigerenzerHoffrage1995" /&gt; and experts.&lt;ref name="Hoffrage2000"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hoffrage | first1 = U. | last2 = Lindsey | first2 = S. | last3 = Hertwig | first3 = R. | last4 = Gigerenzer | first4 = G. | title = Medicine: Communicating Statistical Information | doi = 10.1126/science.290.5500.2261 | journal = Science | volume = 290 | issue = 5500 | pages = 2261–2262 | year = 2000 | pmid =  11188724| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, organizations like the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] recommend using this kind of format for communicating health statistics.&lt;ref name="Cochrane2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Akl | first1 = E.

Why are natural frequency formats helpful? One important reason is that this information format facilitates the required inference because it simplifies the necessary calculations. This can be seen when using an alternative way of computing the required probability ''p''(drunk|''D''):

:&lt;math&gt;p(\mathrm{drunk}\mid D) = \frac{N(\mathrm{drunk} \cap D)}{N(D)} = \frac{1}{51} = 0.0196&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N''(drunk &amp;cap; ''D'') denotes the number of drivers that are drunk and get a positive breathalyzer result, and ''N''(''D'') denotes the total number of cases with a positive breathalyzer result. The equivalence of this equation to the above one follows from the axioms of probability theory, according to which ''N''(drunk &amp;cap; ''D'') = ''N'' × ''p'' (''D'' | drunk) × ''p'' (drunk). Importantly, although this equation is formally equivalent to Bayes’ rule, it is not psychologically equivalent. Using natural frequencies simplifies the inference because the required mathematical operation can be performed on natural numbers, instead of normalized fractions (i.e., probabilities), because it makes the high number of false positives more transparent, and because natural frequencies exhibit a "nested-set structure".&lt;ref name="Girotto2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Girotto | first1 = V. | last2 = Gonzalez | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00133-5 | title = Solving probabilistic and statistical problems: A matter of information structure and question form | journal = Cognition | volume = 78 | issue = 3 | pages = 247–276 | year = 2001 | pmid =  11124351| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoffrage2002" /&gt;

This is different from ''systematic sampling'', in which base rates are fixed a priori (e.g., in scientific experiments). In the latter case it is not possible to infer the posterior probability ''p'' (drunk | positive test) from comparing the number of drivers who are drunk and test positive compared to the total number of people who get a positive breathalyzer result, because base rate information is not preserved and must be explicitly re-introduced using Bayes' theorem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">In computer programming, '''bidirectional transformations (bx)''' are programs in which a single piece of code can be run in several ways, such that the same data are sometimes considered as input, and sometimes as output. For example, a bx run in the forward direction might transform input I into output O, while the same bx run backward would take as input versions of I and O and produce a new version of I as its output.

[[Model transformation#Unidirectional versus bidirectional|Bidirectional model transformations]] are an important special case in which a model is input to such a program.

Some bidirectional languages are [[Bijection|''bijective'']]. The bijectivity of a language is a severe restriction of its bidirectionality,&lt;ref name="nate-foster"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://grace.gsdlab.org/images/e/e2/Nate-short.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726133528/http://grace.gsdlab.org/images/e/e2/Nate-short.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because a bijective language is merely relating two different ways to present the very same information.

More general is a lens language, in which there is a distinguished forward direction ("get") that takes a concrete input to an abstract output, discarding some information in the process: the concrete state includes all the information that is in the abstract state, and usually some more. The backward direction ("put") takes a concrete state and an abstract state and computes a new concrete state. Lenses are required to obey certain conditions to ensure sensible behaviour.

The most general case is that of symmetric bidirectional transformations. Here the two states that are related typically share some information, but each also includes some information that is not included in the other.

== Usage ==

Bidirectional transformations can be used to:

* Maintain the consistency of several sources of information&lt;ref name="grace-report"&gt;http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jnfoster/papers/grace-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Provide an 'abstract view' to easily manipulate data and write them back to their source

== Vocabulary ==

A bidirectional program which obeys certain round-trip laws is called a '''''lens'''''.

== Examples of implementations ==

* [[Boomerang (programming language)|Boomerang]] is a programming language which allows writing lenses to process text data formats bidirectionally
* [[Augeas (software)|Augeas]] is a configuration management library whose lens language is inspired by the Boomerang project
* ''biXid'' is a programming language for processing XML data bidirectionally&lt;ref name="bixid"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://arbre.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hahosoya/papers/bixid.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702195028/http://arbre.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hahosoya/papers/bixid.pdf |archive-date=2007-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Biological functionalism''' is an [[anthropological]] paradigm, asserting that all [[social organisation|social institutions]], beliefs, values and practices serve to address pragmatic concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~n51ls801/340life.html |title=The Meaning of "Life" |author=Austin, D.F. |year=2000 |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624005750/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~n51ls801/340life.html |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the theorem derives from the longer-established [[structural functionalism]], yet the two theorems diverge from one another significantly.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-rathouse.com/EvenMoreAustrianProgram/EMACulturevsGMProg.html |title=Comparing "The Strong Program in Cultural Theory |accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both maintain the fundamental belief that a [[social structure]] is composed of many interdependent [[frame of reference|frames of reference]], biological functionalists criticise the structural view that a [[solidarity (sociology)|social solidarity]] and collective conscience is required in a functioning system.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; By that fact, biological functionalism maintains that our individual survival and health is the driving provocation of actions, and that the importance of social rigidity is negligible.

==Everyday application==
Although the actions of humans without doubt do not always engender positive results for the individual, a biological functionalist would argue that the intention was still [[self-preservation]], albeit unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/basic_needs.pdf |title=Biological Adaptation in Human Societies: A 'Basic Needs' Approach |author=Corning, Peter A. |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725082133/http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/basic_needs.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the belief in luck as an entity; while a disproportionately strong belief in good luck may lead to undesirable results, such as a huge loss in money from gambling, biological functionalism maintains that the newly created ability of the gambler to condemn luck will allow them to be free of individual blame, thus serving a practical and individual purpose. In this sense, biological functionalism maintains that while bad results often occur in life, which do not serve any pragmatic concerns, an entrenched [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychological]] motivation was attempting to create a positive result, in spite of its eventual failure.

'''Blood money''', also called '''bloodwit''', is money or some sort of compensation paid by an offender (usually a murderer) or his/her family group to the family or kin group of the victim.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/blood-money-sociology |title=blood money &amp;#124; sociology &amp;#124; Britannica.com|author=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particular examples and uses==
Blood money is, colloquially, the reward for bringing a criminal to justice. A common meaning in other contexts is the money-penalty paid by a murderer to the kinsfolk of the victim. These fines completely protect the offender (or the kinsfolk thereof) from the vengeance of the injured family. The system was common among [[Germanic peoples]] before the introduction of [[Christianity]] ([[weregild]]), and a scale of payments, graduated according to the heinousness of the crime, was fixed by laws, which further settled who could exact the blood-money, and who were entitled to share it. Homicide was not the only crime thus expiable: blood-money could be exacted for all crimes of violence. Some acts, such as killing someone in a church or while asleep, or within the precincts of the royal palace, were "bot-less"; and the death penalty was inflicted. Such a criminal was outlawed, and could be killed on sight.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Blood-Money|volume=4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Islam===
{{main|Qisas|Diyya}}
In Islamic terms, Qisas can in some cases result in blood money being paid out to the family of victims. The amount varies from country to country and from case to case.

===In Judaism===
As a person's life is considered as being the property of God, Judaism forbids the taking of blood-money for the life of a murdered victim.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/3409-blood-money&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Japan===
In Japanese culture it is common to give blood money or ''mimaikin'' to a victim's family.  Such was the case with [[Lucie Blackman]]'s father who accepted £450,000 as blood money for the murder of his daughter.&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web |date=2007-04-20|url = http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-23393379-details/Lucie%27s%20father%20%27helped%20killer%20by%20accepting%20blood%20money%27/article.do|title = Lucie's father 'helped killer by accepting blood money'|publisher = This is London Magazine Ltd| accessdate = 2009-03-20 | last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Korea===
Under the Korean legal system, it is common for those accused of both minor (such as defamation) and serious crimes (such as rape) to offer blood money (''hapuigeum'', 합의금) to the victim, and if accepted then the perpetrator is usually excused further punishment.  It is often brokered by the police.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Walsh [http://www.koreaherald.com/lifestyle/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20090812000108], "Korea Herald", March 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyse Comins {{cite web|url=http://www.womensnet.org.za/news/rapist-increases-blood-money-offer |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721084533/http://www.womensnet.org.za/news/rapist-increases-blood-money-offer |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}, "Daily News", October 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite being common practice, its use in high-profile cases does sometimes result in protests.&lt;ref&gt;Son Jun-hyun [http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/451375.html], "The Hankyoreh", November 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Somalia===
In the [[Somali people]]'s [[customary law]], which they call ''[[Xeer]]'' (a [[polycentric law|polycentric]] legal system developed indigenously), blood money is issued in the event of libel, theft, physical harm, rape and death, as well as to supply assistance to relatives of the injured party.&lt;ref name="SJS"&gt;

==Other meanings or uses==

===In Christianity===
In the Christian [[Bible]], the term is used to refer to the [[thirty pieces of silver]] [[Judas Iscariot]] received in exchange for revealing the identity of [[Jesus Christ]] to the forces sent by the [[Pharisees]] and/or the [[Sanhedrin]]. After the [[crucifixion]] of Christ, Judas returned the payment to the chief priests, who “took the silver pieces and said, ‘It is not lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.’” &lt;ref&gt;Matthew 27:6&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In shipping ===
"[[Shanghaiing]]" was the practice of the forced conscription of [[sailor]]s.  Boarding masters, whose job it was to find crews for ships, were paid "by the body," and thus had a strong incentive to place as many seamen on ships as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hope |first=Ronald | title= Poor Jack: The Perilous History of the Merchant Seaman |year=2001 |publisher= Greenhill Books|location= London|isbn=1-86176-161-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sup1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sailors.org/pdf/history1-2.pdf |title=The Lookout of the Labor Movement |accessdate=2007-04-02 |work=Sailors Union of the Pacific |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030512184317/http://www.sailors.org/pdf/history1-2.pdf |archivedate=2003-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This pay was called blood money.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/shanghai/main.html|title=About That Blood in the Scuppers |accessdate=2007-04-03 |author=Georgia Smith |date= |year=1988  |work= Reclaiming San Francisco: History Politics and Culture, a City Lights Anthology |publisher=City Lights |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061011111827/http://www.shapingsf.org/ezine/labor/shanghai/main.html |archivedate = 2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bullying''' is the use of force, threat, or [[coercion]] to [[abuse]], [[intimidate]] or aggressively [[wikt:domination|dominate]] others. The behavior is often repeated and habitual. One essential prerequisite is the perception, by the bully or by others, of an imbalance of [[Power (social and political)|social]] or physical power, which distinguishes bullying from conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Juvonen, J. |author2=Graham, S. | title =Bullying in Schools: The Power of Bullies and the Plight of Victims | journal =Annual Review of Psychology| volume =65 | publisher =Annual Reviews | date =2014| pages=159–85 | url =http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030 | doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010213-115030 | pmid=23937767}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors used to assert such domination can include verbal [[harassment]] or [[threat]], physical [[assault]] or coercion, and such acts may be directed repeatedly towards particular targets.

Bullying ranges from one-on-one, individual bullying through to group bullying called [[mobbing]], in which the bully may have one or more "lieutenants" who may seem to be willing to assist the primary bully in his or her bullying activities. Bullying in school and the workplace is also referred to as peer abuse.&lt;ref name="Bennett2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Bennett|title=Peer Abuse Know More!: Bullying from a Psychological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GF06aB7mLdIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Infinity|isbn=978-0-7414-3265-0|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914150852/http://books.google.com/books?id=GF06aB7mLdIC|archivedate=14 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert W.

There is no universal definition of bullying, however, it is widely agreed upon that bullying is a subcategory of aggressive behavior characterized by the following three minimum criteria: (1) hostile intent, (2) imbalance of power and (3) repetition over a period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Burger |first=Christoph |last2=Strohmeier |first2=Dagmar |last3=Spröber |first3=Nina |last4=Bauman |first4=Sheri |last5=Rigby |first5=Ken |date=2015 |title=How teachers respond to school bullying: An examination of self-reported intervention strategy use, moderator effects, and concurrent use of multiple strategies |journal=Teaching and Teacher Education |pages=191–202 |doi=10.1016/j.tate.2015.07.004 |volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying may thus be defined as the activity of repeated, aggressive behavior intended to hurt another individual, physically, mentally or emotionally.

He says negative actions occur "when a person intentionally inflicts injury or discomfort upon another person, through physical contact, through words or in other ways."&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Individual bullying is usually characterized by a person behaving in a certain way to gain [[Power (social and political)|power]] over another person.&lt;ref name="Besag1989"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valerie E.

== Types ==
Individual bullying can be classified into four types.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Invitation to the Life Span|last = Berger|first = Kathleen Stassen|publisher = Worth Publishers|year = 2014|isbn = 1464172056|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective bullying is known as mobbing, and can include any of the individual types of bullying.

Physical, verbal, and relational bullying are most prevalent in primary school and could also begin much earlier whilst continuing into later stages in individuals lives. It is stated that Cyber-bullying is more common in secondary school than in primary school.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Individual ===
Individual bullying tactics can be perpetrated by a single person against a target or targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://respect2all.org/bullying-definitions/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304140405/http://respect2all.org/bullying-definitions/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Physical ====
This is any bullying that hurts someone's body or damages their possessions. Stealing, shoving, hitting, fighting, and destroying property all are types of physical bullying. Physical bullying is rarely the first form of bullying that a target will experience. Often bullying will begin in a different form and later progress to physical violence. In physical bullying the main weapon the bully uses is their body when attacking their target. Sometimes groups of young adults will target and alienate a peer because of some adolescent prejudice. This can quickly lead to a situation where they are being taunted, tortured, and beaten-up by their classmates. Physical bullying will often escalate over time, and can lead to a tragic ending, and therefore must be stopped quickly to prevent any further escalation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|title=no bullying|last=|first=|date=|website=nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|publisher=|access-date=30 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201023450/https://nobullying.com/physical-bullying/|archivedate=1 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Verbal ====
This is any bullying that is conducted by speaking. Calling names, spreading rumors, threatening somebody, and making fun of others are all forms of verbal bullying. Verbal bullying is one of the most common types of bullying. In verbal bullying the main weapon the bully uses is their ''voice''. In many cases, verbal bullying is the province of girls. Girls are more subtle (and can be more devastating), in general, than boys. Girls use verbal bullying, as well as social exclusion techniques, to dominate and control other individuals and show their superiority and power. However, there are also many boys with subtlety enough to use verbal techniques for domination, and who are practiced in using words when they want to avoid the trouble that can come with physically bullying someone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/verbal-bullying.html|title=What is Verbal Bullying and How to Handle Verbal Bullies - Bullying Statistics|date=2015-07-08|newspaper=Bullying Statistics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161125110622/http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/verbal-bullying.html|archivedate=2016-11-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relational ====
This is any bullying that is done with the intent to hurt somebody's reputation or social standing which can also link in with the techniques included in physical and verbal bullying. Relational Bullying is a form of bullying common amongst youth, but particularly upon girls. Relational bullying can be used as a tool by bullies to both improve their social standing and control others. Unlike physical bullying which is obvious, relational bullying is not overt and can continue for a long time without being noticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://antibullyingsoftware.com/what-is-the-definition-of-relational-bullying-social-bullying/|title=What is the Definition of Relational Bullying / Social Bullying  - BRIM Anti-Bullying Software|last=Norton|first=Chris|newspaper=BRIM Anti-Bullying Software|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201080421/https://antibullyingsoftware.com/what-is-the-definition-of-relational-bullying-social-bullying/|archivedate=2016-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cyber-bullying ====
Cyber bullying is the use of technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person. When an adult is involved, it may meet the definition of '''cyber-harassment''' or '''cyberstalking''', a crime that can have legal consequences and involve jail time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/cyberbullying.html|title=Cyberbullying|website=kidshealth.org|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201165708/http://kidshealth.org/en/parents/cyberbullying.html|archivedate=2016-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes email, instant messaging, social networking sites (such as Facebook), text messages, and cell phones.

=== Collective ===
Collective bullying tactics are employed by more than one individual against a target or targets. [[Internet troll|Trolling behavior]] on social media, although generally assumed to be individual in nature by the casual reader, is sometime organized efforts by sponsored [[astroturfing|astroturfers]].

==== Mobbing ====
{{Main|Mobbing}}
Mobbing refers to the bullying of an individual by a group, in any context, such as a [[family]], [[peer group]], [[school]], [[workplace]], [[neighborhood]], [[community]], or online. When it occurs as [[emotion]]al [[abuse]] in the workplace, such as "ganging up" by co-workers, [[Hierarchy|subordinate]]s or [[Superior (hierarchy)|superior]]s, to force someone out of the workplace through [[rumor]], [[innuendo]], [[intimidation]], [[humiliation]], [[discrediting]], and [[Isolation to facilitate abuse|isolation]], it is also referred to as malicious, nonsexual, nonracial / racial, general [[harassment]].&lt;ref&gt;Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace by Noa Davenport, Ruth D.

Dr. Cook says that "a typical bully has trouble resolving problems with others and also has trouble academically.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer groups often promote the bully's actions, and members of these peer groups also engage in behaviors, such as mocking, excluding, punching, and insulting one another as a source of entertainment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other researchers also argued that a minority of the bullies, those who are not in-turn bullied, enjoy going to school, and are least likely to take days off sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title ='Bullies are the healthiest pupils' | newspaper =BBC News | department =Education | publisher =BBC | date =1999-12-14 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/564923.stm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131030192122/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/564923.stm | archivedate =2013-10-30 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Of typical bystanders ===
Often, bullying takes place in the presence of a large group of relatively uninvolved bystanders. In many cases, it is the bully's ability to create the illusion that he or she has the support of the majority present that instills the fear of "speaking out" in protestation of the bullying activities being observed by the group. Unless the "bully mentality" is effectively challenged in any given group in its early stages, it often becomes an accepted, or supported, [[Norm (social)|norm]] within the group.&lt;ref name="bystander attitudes"&gt;{{cite web | title =Bullies, Victims, and Bystanders | work =athealth.com: Consumer: Issues | publisher =Athealth.com | url =http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/issues/BulliesVictimsBystanders3.html | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140305091427/http://www.athealth.com/Consumer/issues/BulliesVictimsBystanders3.html | archivedate =2014-03-05 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =New Tactics To Tackle Bystander's Role In Bullying | newspaper =Science Daily | department =Science News | publisher =Science Daily, LLC | date =2009-01-27 | url =https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090125193150.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184804/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090125193150.htm | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless action is taken, a "[[Bullying culture|culture of bullying]]" is often perpetuated within a group for months, years, or longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =419: Petty Tyrant | work =This American Life: Radio Archive | publisher =Chicago Public Media &amp; Ira Glass | date =2010-11-12 | url =http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131010093611/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/419/petty-tyrant | archivedate =2013-10-10 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bystanders who have been able to establish their own "friendship group" or "support group" have been found to be far more likely to opt to speak out against bullying behavior than those who have not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Pasco students get 'hero' training to stop bullying | newspaper =[[The Tampa Tribune]] | department =Pasco County | publisher =Tampa Media Group, LLC | date =2010-10-12 | url =http://tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-students-get-hero-training-to-stop-bullying-24060 | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001344/http://tbo.com/pasco-county/pasco-students-get-hero-training-to-stop-bullying-24060 | archivedate =2014-05-02 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title =Program Helps Students Combat Bullying - Students participate with enthusiasm | journal =Winning Harmony Counselling | date =2010-10-04 | url =http://www.winningharmony.com/News_and_Events.php | accessdate =2013-10-29 | postscript =&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In addition to communication of clear expectations that bystanders should intervene and increasing individual self-efficacy, there is growing research that suggests interventions should build on the foundation that bullying is morally wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Thornberg | first =Robert | last2 =Tenenbaum | first2 =Laura | last3 =Varjas | first3 =Kris | last4 =Meyers | first4 =Joel | last5 =Jungert | first5 =Tomas | last6 =Vanegas | first6 =Gina | title =Bystander Motivation in Bullying Incidents: To Intervene or Not to Intervene? | journal =Western Journal of Emergency Medicine | volume =13 | issue =3 | pages =247–252 | date =August 2012 | language =  | doi =10.5811/westjem.2012.3.11792| pmc =3415829 | pmid =22900122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among adults, being a bystander to workplace bullying was linked to depression, particularly in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Jensen | first =I.

=== Of victims ===
Dr. Cook says that "A typical victim is likely to be aggressive, lack social skills, think negative thoughts, experience difficulties in solving social problems, come from a negative family, school and community environments and be noticeably rejected and isolated by peers".&lt;ref name="APS2010"/&gt; Victims often have characteristics such as being physically weak, as well as being easily distraught emotionally. They may also have physical characteristics that make them easier targets for bullies such as being overweight or having some type of physical deformity. Boys are more likely to be victims of physical bullying while girls are more likely to be bullied indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Paediatrics and Child Health|year= 2010 |volume=20 |issue=7|pages=315–320|last=Vanderbilt |first=Douglas |last2=Augustyn |first2=Marilyn |url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751722210000715|title=The effects of bullying |doi=10.1016/j.paed.2010.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of a [[meta-analysis]] conducted by Cook and published by the [[American Psychological Association]] in 2010 concluded the main risk factors for children and adolescents being bullied, and also for becoming bullies, are the lack of [[social problem-solving]] skills.&lt;ref name="APS2010"/&gt;

Children who are bullied often show physical or emotional signs, such as: being afraid to attend school, complaining of headaches or a loss of appetite, a lack of interest in school activities and spending time with friends or family, and having an overall sense of sadness.

=== Positive development ===
Some have argued that bullying can teach life lessons and instill strength. Helene Guldberg, a child development academic, sparked controversy when she argued that being a target of bullying can teach a child "how to manage disputes and boost their ability to interact with others", and that teachers should not intervene, but leave children to respond to the bullying themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =Tanya | title =Child Development Academician Says Bullying Is Beneficial To Kids | work =Med India | department =News | publisher =Medindia | date =2009-02-02 | url =http://www.medindia.net/news/Child-Development-Academician-Says-Bullying-Is-Beneficial-To-Kids-46992-1.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131101060052/http://www.medindia.net/news/Child-Development-Academician-Says-Bullying-Is-Beneficial-To-Kids-46992-1.htm | archivedate =2013-11-01 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projection ==
{{Main|Psychological projection}}
A bully may project his/her own feelings of vulnerability onto the target(s) of the bullying activity. Despite the fact that a bully's typically denigrating activities are aimed at the bully's targets, the true source of such negativity is ultimately almost always found in the bully's own sense of personal insecurity and/or vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gilbert, ''Overcoming Depression'' (1999) p.&amp;nbsp;185–6&lt;/ref&gt; Such aggressive projections of displaced negative emotions can occur anywhere from the micro-level of interpersonal relationships, all the way up through to the macro-level of international politics, or even international armed conflict.&lt;ref name="micro and macro projection"&gt;Carl G.

Bullying is abusive social interaction between peers which can include aggression, harassment, and violence. Bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of [[Abusive power and control|power]] over the victim. A growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and [[emotional intelligence]] (EI). [[John D. Mayer|Mayer]] et al., (2008) defines the dimensions of overall EI as: "accurately perceiving emotion, using emotions to facilitate thought, understanding emotion, and managing emotion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mayer | first1 = J.D. | last2 = Roberts | first2 = R.D | last3 = Barasade | first3 = S.G. | year = 2008 | title = Human abilities: Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 507–536 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.59.103006.093646 | pmid = 17937602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines emotional and intellectual processes.&lt;ref name="Tolegenova"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.12.142|title = A Theoretical Formation of Emotional Intelligence and Childhood Trauma among Adolescents| journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences| volume=69| pages=1891–1894|year = 2012|last1 = Tolegenova|first1 = A.A.| last2=Jakupov| first2=S.M.| last3=Chung| first3=Man Cheung| last4=Saduova| first4=S.| last5=Jakupov| first5=M.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying, as the bully and/or the victim of bullying. EI seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and [[victimization]] in bullying; given that EI is illustrated to be malleable, EI education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mckenna | first1 = J. | last2 = Webb | first2 = J. | year = 2013 | title = Emotional intelligence | url = | journal = British Journal of Occupational Therapy | volume = 76 | issue = 12| page = 560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cyberbullying ===
{{Main|Cyberbullying}}
Cyberbullying is any bullying done through the use of technology. This form of bullying can easily go undetected because of lack of parental/authoritative supervision. Because bullies can pose as someone else, it is the most anonymous form of bullying. Cyberbullying includes, but is not limited to, abuse using email, instant messaging, text messaging, websites, social networking sites, etc.&lt;ref name="BoltonGraeve2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jose Bolton|author2=Stan Graeve|title=No Room for Bullies: From the Classroom to Cyberspace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOUWBckRIBIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2005|publisher=Boys Town Press|isbn=978-1-889322-67-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120429/http://books.google.com/books?id=WOUWBckRIBIC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the creation of social networks like [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]], [[Instagram]], and [[Twitter]], cyberbullying has increased.

It has been noted that disabled people are disproportionately affected by bullying and abuse, and such activity has been cited as a hate crime.&lt;ref name="Quarmby2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Katherine Quarmby|title=Scapegoat: Why We Are Failing Disabled People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lglMYgEACAAJ|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2011|publisher=Portobello Books Limited|isbn=978-1-84627-321-6|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120453/http://books.google.com/books?id=lglMYgEACAAJ|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bullying is not limited to those who are visibly disabled, such as wheelchair-users or physically deformed such as those with a cleft lip, but also those with learning disabilities, such as [[autism]]&lt;ref name="Sainsbury2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clare Sainsbury|title=Martian in the Playground: Understanding the Schoolchild with Asperger's Syndrome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbGwEaH8eAIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=30 September 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4462-4398-5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120424/http://books.google.com/books?id=TbGwEaH8eAIC|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Attwood2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Attwood|title=The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwQGsuCNMPYC|accessdate=2013-10-29|year=2006|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-84310-495-7|pages=95–111|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120355/http://books.google.com/books?id=ZwQGsuCNMPYC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name="Kirby2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amanda Kirby|title=Dyspraxia: The Hidden Handicap|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=so-3-vIf0lkC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=1 October 2002|publisher=Souvenir Press|isbn=978-0-285-63512-8|pages=106–113|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120440/http://books.google.com/books?id=so-3-vIf0lkC|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brookes2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoff Brookes|title=Dyspraxia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZDqe-SckjIC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=January 2005|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-7581-7|pages=43–46|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120352/http://books.google.com/books?id=wZDqe-SckjIC|archivedate=2014-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an additional problem that those with learning disabilities are often not as able to explain things to other people, so are more likely to be disbelieved or ignored if they do complain.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

=== Gay bullying ===
{{Main|Gay bashing}}
Gay bullying and gay bashing designate direct or indirect [[verbal abuse|verbal]] or [[physical abuse|physical]] actions by a person or group against someone who is gay or lesbian, or perceived to be so due to rumors or because they are considered to fit gay stereotypes. Gay and lesbian youth are more likely than straight youth to report bullying.&lt;ref name="Berlan et al., 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Berlan | first =Elise D. | last2 =Corliss | first2 =Heather L. | last3 =Field | first3 =Alison E. | last4 =Goodman | first4 =Elizabeth | last5 =Austin | first5 =S.

=== Legal bullying ===
{{Main|Legal abuse}}
Legal bullying is the bringing of a [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious legal action]] to control and punish a person. Legal bullying can often take the form of frivolous, repetitive, or burdensome lawsuits brought to intimidate the defendant into submitting to the litigant's request, not because of the legal merit of the litigant's position, but principally due to the defendant's inability to maintain the legal battle. This can also take the form of [[Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation]] (SLAPP). It was partially concern about the potential for this kind of abuse that helped to fuel the [[protests against SOPA and PIPA]] in the United States in 2011 and 2012.

=== Military bullying ===
{{Main|Bullying in the military}}
In 2000, the UK [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] (MOD) defined bullying as "the use of physical strength or the [[abuse of authority]] to intimidate or victimize others, or to give unlawful punishments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Dannatt | first =Sir Richard | title =Values and Standards of the British Army | chapter =Lawful: Paragraph 20 | publisher =the British Army | year =2008 | url =http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130817150435/http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/v_s_of_the_british_army.pdf | archivedate =2013-08-17 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that this behaviour should be allowed, due to ways in which "soldiering" is different from other occupations. Soldiers expected to risk their lives should, according to them, develop strength of body and spirit to accept bullying.&lt;ref name="CallaghanKernic2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean M.

=== Parental bullying of children ===
{{See also|Child abuse|Narcissistic parent|Parental narcissistic abuse}}
Parents who may [[Displacement (psychology)|displace]] their anger, insecurity, or a persistent need to dominate and [[Abusive power and control|control]] upon their children in excessive ways have been proven to increase the likelihood that their own children will in turn become overly aggressive or controlling towards their peers.&lt;ref name="parent bullying"&gt;{{cite web | last =Priesnitz | first =Wendy | title =Parental Bullying Creates Bullies | work =Natural Child Magazine | publisher =Wendy Priesnitz | url =http://www.naturalchildmagazine.com/news/parental_bullying_creates_bullies.htm | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031134551/http://www.naturalchildmagazine.com/news/parental_bullying_creates_bullies.htm | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[American Psychological Association]] advises on its website that parents who may suspect that their own children may be engaging in bullying activities among their peers should carefully consider the examples which they themselves may be setting for their own children regarding how they typically interact with their own peers, colleagues, and children.&lt;ref name = "APA on parental bullying"&gt;{{cite web | title =Bullying: How parents, teachers, and kids can take action to prevent bullying | work =American Psychological Association | publisher =American Psychological Association | url = http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/bullying.aspx# | accessdate = 2013-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prison bullying ===
{{Main|Prisoner abuse}}
An environment known for bullying is in prisons. An additional complication is the staff and their relationships with the inmates. Thus the following possible bullying scenarios are possible:
* Inmate bullies inmate (echoing school bullying)
* Staff bullies inmate
* Staff bullies staff (a manifestation of workplace bullying)
* Inmate bullies staff

=== School bullying (bullying of students in schools) ===
{{Main|School bullying}}
Bullying can occur in nearly any part in or around the school building, although it may occur more frequently during physical education classes and activities such as recess. Bullying also takes place in school hallways, bathrooms, on school buses and while waiting for buses, and in classes that require group work and/or after school activities. Bullying in school sometimes consists of a group of students taking advantage of or isolating one student in particular and gaining the loyalty of bystanders who want to avoid becoming the next target. In the 2011 documentary [[Bully (2011 film)|''Bully'']], we see first hand the torture that kids go through both in school and while on the school bus. As the movie follows around a few kids we see how bullying affects them both at school as well as in their homes. While bullying has no age limit, these bullies may taunt and tease their target before finally physically bullying them. Bystanders typically choose to either participate or watch, sometimes out of fear of becoming the next target.

Bullying can also be perpetrated by teachers and the school system itself; there is an inherent power differential in the system that can easily predispose to subtle or covert abuse ([[relational aggression]] or [[passive aggression]]), [[humiliation]], or exclusion — even while maintaining overt commitments to anti-bullying policies.&lt;ref name="GarbarinodeLara2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Garbarino|author2=Ellen deLara|title=And Words Can Hurt Forever: How to Protect Adolescents from Bullying, Harassment, and Emotional Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XPx-OLgQjQC|accessdate=2013-10-29|date=2 September 2003|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-2899-2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101120850/http://books.google.com/books?id=3XPx-OLgQjQC|archivedate=1 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Witted | first =Kathryn Suzanne | title =Student Reports of Physical and Psychological Maltreatment in Schools: An Under Explored Aspect of Student Victimization in Schools | work =PhD dissertation, University of Tennessee | year =2005 | url =http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=utk_graddiss | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031121558/http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3874&amp;context=utk_graddiss | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1177/0013124507304487 |title=Do Teachers Bully Students?: Findings From a Survey of Students in an Alternative Education Setting |year=2007 |last1=Whitted |first1=K.

In 2016, in Canada, a North American legal precedent was set by a mother and her son, after the son was bullied in his public school. The mother and son won a court case against the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board, making this the first case in North America where a school board has been found negligent in a bullying case for failing to meet the standard of care (the "duty of care" that the school board owes to its students). Thus, it sets a precedent of a school board being found liable in negligence for harm caused to a child, because they failed to protect a child from the bullying actions of other students. There has been only one other similar bullying case and it was won in Australia in 2013 (Oyston v. St. Patricks College, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottawacommunitynews.com/news-story/6773614-family-wins-precedent-setting-case-against-public-school-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210080755/http://www.ottawacommunitynews.com/news-story/6773614-family-wins-precedent-setting-case-against-public-school-board/ |archivedate=2017-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual bullying ===
{{Main|Sexual bullying}}
{{See also|Slut-shaming}}
Sexual bullying is "Any bullying behaviour, whether physical or non-physical, that is based on a person's sexuality or gender. It is when sexuality or gender is used as a weapon by boys or girls towards other boys or girls – although it is more commonly directed at girls. It can be carried out to a person's face, behind their back or through the use of technology."&lt;ref name=NSPCC02&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w1.qehs.net/moodle2/pluginfile.php/10744/mod_resource/content/1/Sexual%20bullying.pdf |title=The NSPCC working definition of Sexual Bullying |publisher=[[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children|NSPCC]] |accessdate=13 September 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220065205/http://w1.qehs.net/moodle2/pluginfile.php/10744/mod_resource/content/1/Sexual%20bullying.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trans bullying ===
{{Main|Trans bashing}}
'''Trans bashing''' is the act of [[victimizing]] a person physically, sexually, or verbally because they are [[transgender]] or [[Transsexualism|transsexual]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20774504-5005961,00.html Guilty plea over transsexual bashing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502173830/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C20774504-5005961%2C00.html |date=2008-05-02 }} By Mariza O'Keefe in ''Herald Sun''&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[gay bashing]], it is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]], not [[sexual orientation]].

=== Workplace bullying ===
{{Main|Workplace bullying}}
Workplace bullying occurs when an employee experiences a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes harm.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C. &amp; Keashley, L. (2005). Bullying at work: A perspective from Britain and North America. In S. Fox &amp; P. E. Spector (eds.) Counterproductive work behavior: Investigations of actors and targets (pp. 271-296). Washington DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Workplace bullying can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]] abuse and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[workplace aggression]] is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical forms of [[school bullying]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. Bullying in the workplace is in the majority of cases reported as having been perpetrated by someone in authority over the target. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally can be subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Rayner, C., &amp; Cooper, C. L. (2006). Workplace Bullying. In Kelloway, E., Barling, J. &amp; Hurrell Jr., J. (eds.), Handbook of workplace violence (pp. 47-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known documented use of "workplace bullying" is in 1992 in a book by [[Andrea Adams]] called ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It''.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=workplace+bullying&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1990&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4%3B%2Cworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%2Cs0%3B%3Bworkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20Bullying%3B%2Cc0%3B%3BWorkplace%20bullying%3B%2Cc0 Google ngrams]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrea Adams|Adams, Andrea]] with contributions from Crawford, Neil ''Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence, and maintenance of bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, S., Troth, A &amp; Branch, S . (2010). Work-place bullying: A group processes framework ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84(4), 799-816.''&lt;/ref&gt; Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors or known by many throughout the organization. Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in [[employee morale]] and a change in [[organizational culture]].&lt;ref name="SilentEpidemic" /&gt; A [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane Collaboration]] [[systematic review]] has found very low quality [[Scientific evidence|evidence]] to suggest that organizational and individual interventions may prevent bullying behaviors in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009778.pub2/abstract|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|last=Gillen|first=Patricia A|last2=Sinclair|first2=Marlene|last3=Kernohan|first3=W George|last4=Begley|first4=Cecily M|last5=Luyben|first5=Ans G|date=2017-01-30|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|issn=1465-1858|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd009778.pub2/full|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307203800/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009778.pub2/abstract|archivedate=2017-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In academia ====
{{Main|Bullying in academia}}
Bullying in academia is workplace bullying of scholars and staff in academia, especially places of higher education such as colleges and universities. It is believed to be common, although has not received as much attention from researchers as bullying in some other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;

==== In blue collar jobs ====
Bullying has been identified as prominent in blue collar jobs, including on oil rigs and in mechanic shops and machine shops. It is thought that intimidation and fear of retribution cause decreased incident reports. In industry sectors dominated by males, typically of little education, where disclosure of incidents are seen as effeminate, reporting in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries would likely lead to a [[vicious circle]]. This is often used in combination with [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] and [[coercion]] of facts to gain favour among higher-ranking [[administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;

It is believed that its adversarial, hierarchical tradition contributes towards this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf Le Mire, Suzanne; Owens, Rosemary ''A propitious moment?: Workplace bullying and regulation of the legal profession'' University of New South Wales Law Journal, The Volume 37 Issue 3 (Dec 2014)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001112/http://www.unswlawjournal.unsw.edu.au/sites/default/files/t1_le_mire_and_owens.pdf |date=2015-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more impacted, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx#.VMfxpyzp-24 Society publishes guidance on tackling bullying in solicitor profession] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201001313/http://www.journalonline.co.uk/News/1009923.aspx |date=2015-02-01 }} The Journal of the Law Society of Scotland 27 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In medicine ====
{{Main|Bullying in medicine}}
Bullying in the [[medical profession]] is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors and of nurses. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession, which may result in a bullying cycle.

==== In nursing ====
{{Main|Bullying in nursing}}
Even though The [[American Nurses Association]] believes that all nursing personnel have the right to work in safe, non-abusive environments, bullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent in the nursing profession although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that relational aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossipping and intimidation) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied among girls but not so much among adult women.&lt;ref name="RichardsEdwards2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nursingworld.org/Bullying-Workplace-Violence Workplace Violence Statistics {{cite journal | last =Dellasega | first =Cheryl A. | title =Bullying Among Nurses | journal =American Journal of Nursing | volume =109 | issue =1 | pages =52–58 | publisher =Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | year =2009 | url =http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Abstract/2009/01000/Bullying_Among_Nurses.28.aspx | doi =10.1097/01.NAJ.0000344039.11651.08 | accessdate =2013-10-28 | pmid =19112267 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131031224030/http://journals.lww.com/ajnonline/Abstract/2009/01000/Bullying_Among_Nurses.28.aspx | archivedate =2013-10-31 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In teaching ====
{{Main|Bullying in teaching}}
[[School]] [[teachers]] are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.

=== In other areas ===
As the verb ''to bully'' is defined as simply "forcing one's way aggressively or by intimidation", the term may generally apply to any life experience where one is motivated primarily by intimidation instead of by more positive goals, such as mutually shared interests and benefits. As such, any figure of authority or power who may use intimidation as a primary means of motivating others, such as a neighborhood "protection racket don", a national dictator, a childhood ring-leader, a terrorist, a terrorist organization, or even a ruthless business CEO, could rightfully be referred to as a bully. According to psychologist Pauline Rennie-Peyton, we each face the possibility of being bullied in any phase of our lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Karim | first =Nadiya | title =Bullying in Universities: It exists | newspaper =The Independent | department =News: Education: Higher | publisher =The Independent | date =2010-01-15 | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bullying-in-universities-it-exists-1869267.html | accessdate =2013-10-29 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131216063925/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/bullying-in-universities-it-exists-1869267.html | archivedate =2013-12-16 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inanimate objects ===
Children have been observed bullying anthropomorphic robots designed to assist the elderly. Their attacks start with blocking the robots' paths of movement and then escalate to verbal abuse, hitting and destroying the object. Seventy-five percent of the kids interviewed perceived the robot as "human-like" yet decided to abuse it anyway, while 35% of the kids who beat up the robot actually did so "for enjoyment.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/kids-attack-bully-robot-japanese-mall-danger-avoidance-ai-2015-8?IR=T|title=Scientists are teaching robots to avoid children — because kids can be surprisingly mean|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responding to bullying ==
Bullying is typically ongoing and not isolated behaviour. Common ways that people try to respond, are to try to ignore it, to confront the bullies or to turn to an authority figure to try and address it.

Ignoring it often does nothing to stop the bullying continuing, and it can become worse over time.&lt;ref&gt;W. Craig et al., [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0143034307084136 "Responding to bullying, what works"]&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be important to address bullying behaviour early on, as it can be easier to control the earlier it is detected.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ci, [https://carleton.ca/economics/wp-content/uploads/bullying_paper_1-6.pdf "What can be done to stop bullying among children? Evidence from Canada"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Bystanders play an important role in responding to bullying, as doing nothing can encourage it to continue, while small steps that oppose the behaviour can reduce it.&lt;ref&gt;Bully-zero Australia Foundation, [http://bzaf.org.au/respond-to-bullying/ "Respond to bullying"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Authority figures can play an important role, such as parents in child or adolescent situations, or supervisors, human-resources staff or parent-bodies in workplace and volunteer settings. Authority figures can be influential in recognising and stopping bullying behaviour, and creating an environment where it doesn't continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stopbullying.gov/respond/on-the-spot/index.html "Stop bullying on the spot"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Safe work Australia, [https://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/doc/guide-preventing-and-responding-workplace-bullying "Guide for preventing and responding to workplace bullying"]&lt;/ref&gt;
In many situations however people acting as authority figures are untrained and unqualified, do not know how to respond, and can make the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;Veronica Birkett, [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/bullied-dont-tell-the-teacher-1361862.html "Bullied? Don't tell the teacher"]&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases the authority figures even support the people doing the bullying, facilitating it continuing and increasing the isolation and marginalising of the target.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ethicsinvolunteering.wordpress.com/responding-to-bullying-in-arc-unsw-sports/ "Responding to bullying in Arc UNSW sports"]&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the most effective ways to respond, are to recognise that harmful behaviour is taking place, and creating an environment where it won't continue.&lt;ref name=field03&gt;E. Field, [http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=ee/bullying/subs/sub58.pdf "The prevalence of workplace bullying in Australia"]&lt;/ref&gt;
People that are being targeted have little control over which authority figures they can turn to and how such matters would be addressed, however one means of support is to find a counsellor or psychologist that is trained in handling bullying.

== Etymology ==
The word "[[bully]]" was first used in the 1530s meaning "sweetheart", applied to either sex, from the Dutch ''boel'' "lover, brother", probably diminutive of [[Middle High German]] ''buole'' "brother", of uncertain origin (compare with the German ''buhle'' "lover"). The meaning deteriorated through the 17th century through "fine fellow", "blusterer", to "harasser of the weak". This may have been as a connecting sense between "lover" and "ruffian" as in "protector of a prostitute", which was one sense of "bully" (though not specifically attested until 1706). The verb "to bully" is first attested in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =bully | work =Online Etymology Dictionary | publisher =Douglas Harper | url =http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bully | accessdate =2013-10-28 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195402/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bully | archivedate =2013-10-29 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, in American culture, the term has been used differently, as an exclamation/exhortation, in particular famously associated with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapell.org/manuscript/theodore-roosevelt-bully-for-you ''TR Correspondence 27 September 1907''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416024951/http://www.shapell.org/manuscript/theodore-roosevelt-bully-for-you |date=16 April 2016 }} "bully for you" in the positive sense&lt;/ref&gt; and continuing to the present in the [[bully pulpit]] and also as faint/deprecating praise ("bully for him").

'''Circles of Sustainability''' is a method for understanding and assessing [[sustainability]], and for managing projects directed towards socially sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= with Magee | first2= Liam | last3= Scerri | first3= Andy | last4= Steger | first4= Manfred B. | title= Urban Sustainability in Theory and Practice: Circles of Sustainability | url= https://www.academia.edu/9294719/Urban_Sustainability_in_Theory_and_Practice_Circles_of_Sustainability_2015_ | year= 2015 | publisher= Routledge | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to handle 'seemingly intractable problems'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities |title=CITIES - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as outlined in [[sustainable development]] debates. The method is mostly used for cities and urban settlements.

Circles of Sustainability, and its treatment of the social domains of ecology, economics, politics and culture, provides the empirical dimension of an approach called '[[engaged theory]]'. Developing Circles of Sustainability is part of larger project called 'Circles of Social Life', using the same four-domain model to analyze questions of resilience, adaptation, security, reconciliation. It is also being used in relation to thematics such as 'Circles of Child Wellbeing' (with World Vision).

The rationale for this new method is clear. As evidenced by Rio+20 and the UN Habitat World Urban Forum in Napoli (2012) and Medellin (2014), sustainability assessment is on the global agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672|accessdate=September 9, 2012|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911065400/http://www.unhabitat.org/categories.asp?catid=672#|archive-date=11 September 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more complex the problems, the less useful current sustainability assessment tools seem to be for assessing across different domains: economics, ecology, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, Paul James, Andy Scerri, ‘Measuring Social Sustainability: A Community-Centred Approach’, Applied Research in the Quality of Life, vol. 7, no. 3., 2012, pp. 239–61.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Triple Bottom Line]] approach tends to take the economy as its primary point of focus with the domain of the environmental as the key externality. Secondly, the one-dimensional quantitative basis of many such methods means that they have limited purchase on complex qualitative issues. Thirdly, the size, scope and sheer number of indicators included within many such methods means that they are often unwieldy and resist effective implementation. Fourthly, the restricted focus of current indicator sets means that they do not work across different organizational and social settings—corporations and other institutions, cities, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Magee, Andy Scerri, Paul James, Lin Padgham, James Thom, Hepu Deng, Sarah Hickmott, and Felicity Cahill, ‘Reframing Sustainability Reporting: Towards an Engaged Approach’, Environment, Development and Sustainability, vol. 15, no. 1, 2013, pp. 225–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Most indicator approaches, such as the Global Reporting Initiative or ISO14031, have been limited to large corporate organizations with easily definable legal and economic boundaries. Circles of Sustainability was developed to respond to those limitations.

==History==
The method began with a fundamental dissatisfaction with current approaches to [[sustainability]] and [[sustainable development]], which tended to treat economics as the core domain and ecology as an externality. Two concurrent developments provided impetus: a major project in Porto Alegre, and a United Nations’ paper called ''Accounting for Sustainability'', Briefing Paper, No. 1, 2008. The researchers developed a method and an integrated set of tools for assessing and monitoring issues of sustainability while providing guidance for project development.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie McCarthy, Paul James and Carolines Bayliss, eds, ''Sustainable Cities, Vol. 1'', United Nations Global Compact, Cities Programme, New York and Melbourne, 2010, 134pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The method was then further refined through projects in Melbourne and Milwaukee, and through an ARC-funded cross-disciplinary project&lt;ref&gt;‘Semantic Technologies to Help Machines Understand Us: Fuji Xerox leads RMIT to $1.4m Grant for Real-Time Green Reports’, ''IT Business'', 30 October 2009.

However, unlike this system, the Canadian index data-sets are focused on measuring the physical footprints of human activity and greenspace footprints which are less subjectivity than cultural and economic&lt;ref&gt;‘Subjectivity in Economics’, ''SSRN'', June 1, 2012. Matthew T. Clements, ‘Abstract: Economics cannot claim to be absolutely objective...’,''St. Edward's University'', &lt;/ref&gt; indicators.

==Use of the method==
The method is used by a series of global organizations including the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme, The World Association of Major Metropolises,&lt;ref&gt;The methodology was used by Metropolis for Commission 2, 2012, Managing Urban Growth. This Commission, which met across the period 2009–2011, was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis’s 120 member cities on the theme of managing growth. The Commission Report using the ‘Circles of Sustainability’ methodology was published on the web in three languages—English, French and Spanish—and is used by member cities as a guide to practice. (See http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819002102/http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions# |date=19 August 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[World Vision]] to support their engagement in cities. It is also used by a number of cities across the world in different ways to manage major projects or to provide feedback on their sustainability profiles (e.g., Hyderabad, Johannesburg, Melbourne, New Delhi, São Paulo and Tehran). It is a method for understanding [[urban politics]] and [[urban planning]], as well as for conducting [[sustainability]] analysis and profiling [[sustainable development]].

===Global Compact Cities Programme===
The methodology is made available by UN Global Compact Cities Programme for its engagement with its more than 80 Signatory Cities. In particular, some of the 14 Innovating Cities in the programme have influenced the development of the Circles of Sustainability method through their management of major projects, some with intensity and others as a background feature. They use a cross-sectoral and holistic approach for developing a response to self-defined seemingly intractable problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities |title=CITIES - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Porto Alegre, Vila Chocolatão project====

The Vila Chocolatão project refers to the 2011 resettlement of approximately 1,000 residents of the inner-city Vila Chocolatão slum in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil. The resettlement project of Vila Chocolatão commenced in 2000 in response to an imminent eviction of the community, with community members seeking resources and support to resettle through the city of Porto Alegre's renown [[participatory budgeting]] system. The lengthy preparation to resettle was led by a local cross-sectoral network group, the Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network. The group was initially instigated by the Regional Court, TRF4 and consisted of the Vila Chocolatão Residents Association, local government departments, federal agencies, non-government organisations and the corporate sector. The project was supported by the City of Porto Alegre through the municipality’s Local Solidarity Governance Scheme. In 2006, the Vila Chocolatao resettlement project was recognised as a pilot project for the then new Cities Programme cross-sectoral model with City Hall assembling a Critical Reference Group to identify critical issues and joint solutions to those issues involved in the resettlement.

This long-standing collaborative project has been successful in rehousing a whole community of slum dwellers, it has also effected a restructuring of how the city approaches slums. The project ensured sustainability was built into the relocation through changes such as setting up of recycling depots next to existing slums and developing a formal recycling sorting facility in the new site, Residencial Nova Chocolatão, linked to the garbage-collection process of the city (an example of linking the sub-domains of ‘emission and waste’ and ‘organization and governance’); and establishing a fully resourced early childhood centre in the new community. The Vila Chocolatão Sustainability Network group continues to meet and work with the community post the resettlement.  This network-led model is now being utilized by the City of Porto Alegre with other informal settlements.

====Milwaukee, water sustainability project====

In 2009, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States of America, wanted to address the issue of water quality in the city.&lt;ref&gt;''Milwaukee Business Journal'', 29 April 2009; John Schmid, ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel'', 27 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Circles of Sustainability methodology became the basis for an integrated city project. In the period of the application of the method (2009–present) there has been a rediscovery of the value of water from an industry and broader community perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://citiesprogramme.com/cities/americas/usa/milwaukee |title=Milwaukee - The Cities Programme |work=citiesprogramme.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Milwaukee won the United States Water Prize given by the Clean Water America Alliance, as well as a prize from IBM Better Cities program worth $500,000. The community has also attracted some leading water treatment innovators and is establishing a graduate School of Freshwater Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewatercouncil.com/temp2/un-global-compact/ |title=UN Global Compact &amp;#124; Milwaukee Water Council |work=thewatercouncil.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120815005612/http://www.thewatercouncil.com/temp2/un-global-compact/# |archive-date=15 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolis (World  Association of the Major Metropolises)===
The methodology was first used by Metropolis for ''Commission 2, 2012, Managing Urban Growth''. This Commission, which met across the period 2009–2011, was asked to make recommendations for use by Metropolis’s 120 member cities on the theme of managing growth. The Commission Report using the Circles of Sustainability methodology was published on the web in three languages—English, French and Spanish—and is used by member cities as a guide to practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions |title=Publications / Commissions &amp;#124; Metropolis |work=metropolis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819002102/http://www.metropolis.org/publications/commissions# |archive-date=19 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the research team were invited by Metropolis to work with the Victorian Government and the Cities Programme on one of their major initiatives. The methodology is central to the approach used by the ‘Integrated Strategic Planning and Public-Private Partnerships Initiative’ organized by Metropolis, 2012–2013 for Indian, Brazilian and Iranian cities. A workshop was held in New Delhi, 26–27 July 2012, and senior planners from New Delhi, Hyderabad and Kolkata used the two of the assessment tools in the Circles of Sustainability toolbox to map the sustainability of their cities as part of developing their urban-regional plans. Other cities to use the same tools have been Tehran (in relation to their mega-projects plan) and São Paulo (in relation to their macro-metropolitan plan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metropolis.org/news/metropolis-initiative-integrated--1 |title=Metropolis Initiative "Integrated Strategic Planning and Public Private Partnerships" meets in New Delhi &amp;#124; Metropolis |work=metropolis.org |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, the Cities Programme and Metropolis have worked together to refine the 'Circles of Sustainability' method to use with their respective member cities. A Metropolis Taskforce was charged with further developing the method.

===''The Economist''===
In 2011, ''The Economist'' invited [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] (Director of the [[United Nations Global Compact]] Cities Programme) and Chetan Vedya (Director, National Institute of Urban Affairs, India) into a debate around the question of urban sustainability and metropolitan growth. It led to over 200 letters to the editor in direct response as well as numerous linked citations on other websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.economist.com/debate/overview/192 |title=Economist Debates: Cities |work=economist.com |year=2012 |accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Vision===
In 2011, recognising how much the two processes of urbanization and globalization were changing the landscape of poverty, [[World Vision]] decided to shift its orientation towards urban settings. Previously 80 per cent of its projects had been in small rural communities. The Circles of Sustainability method now underpins that reorientation and pilot studies are being conducted in India, South Africa, Lebanon, Indonesia and elsewhere, to refine the methodology for aid delivery in complex urban settings.

==Domains and subdomains==
The Circles of Sustainability approach is explicitly critical of other domain models such as the [[triple bottom line]] that treat economics as if it is outside the social, or that treat the environment as an externality. It uses a four-domain model - economics, ecology, politics and culture. In each of these domains there are 7 subdomains.

===Economics===
The economic domain is defined as the practices and meanings associated with the production, use, and management of resources, where the concept of ‘resources’ is used in the broadest sense of that word.
# Production and resourcing
# Exchange and transfer
# Accounting and regulation
# Consumption and use
# Labour and welfare
# Technology and infrastructure
# Wealth and distribution

===Ecology===
The ecological domain is defined as the practices and meanings that occur across the intersection between the social and the natural realms, focusing on the important dimension of human engagement with and within nature, but also including the built-environment.
# Materials and energy
# Water and air
# Flora and fauna
# Habitat and settlements
# Built-form and transport
# Embodiment and sustenance
# Emission and waste

===Politics===
The political is defined as the practices and meanings associated with basic issues of social power, such as organization, authorization, legitimation and regulation. The parameters of this area extend beyond the conventional sense of politics to include not only issues of public and private governance but more broadly social relations in general.
# Organization and governance
# Law and justice
# Communication and critique
# Representation and negotiation
# Security and accord
# Dialogue and reconciliation
# Ethics and accountability

===Culture===
The cultural domain is defined as the practices, discourses, and material expressions, which, over time, express continuities and discontinuities of social meaning.
# Identity and engagement
# Creativity and recreation
# Memory and projection
# Belief and ideas
# Gender and generations
# Enquiry and learning
# Wellbeing and health

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11249">'''Compelled speech''' is a transmission of expression required by law. A related legal concept is ''[[protected speech]]''.   In the [[United States]], compelled speech is governed by  the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendments]] to the Constitution. In the same way that the First Amendment protects free expression, in many cases it similarly protects an individual from being required to utter or otherwise express a thought with which they disagree.

==Canada==
In Canada, the concept of "compelled speech" became controversial following the [[Government of Canada|Canadian federal government]]'s [[An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code|Bill C-16]], which would add "gender identity or expression" as a prohibited ground of discrimination under the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]]. [[University of Toronto]] Psychology professor and [[Clinical psychology#Professional practice|clinical psychologist]], [[Jordan Peterson]], used the term "compelled speech" to describe the bill on September 27, 2016, in his lecture video series on his [[YouTube]] channel.&lt;ref name="dimanno"&gt;{{cite news|first=Rosie|last=DiManno|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/11/19/new-words-trigger-an-abstract-clash-on-campus-dimanno.html|title=New words trigger an abstract clash on campus|date=November 19, 2016|work=[[Toronto Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he denounced [[political correctness]], in general because of [[free speech]], and compelled speech, in particular. In his video Peterson announced he refused to be compelled to use genderless pronouns.&lt;ref name="dimanno"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Craig |first=Sean |date=September 28, 2016 |title=U of T professor attacks political correctness, says he refuses to use genderless pronouns |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/u-of-t-professor-attacks-political-correctness-in-video-refuses-to-use-genderless-pronouns |newspaper=[[National Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent October 2016 video filmed after a free-speech rally at the University of Toronto went viral. Since then he has attracted a wide following and received significant international media coverage.&lt;ref name="Chronicle18"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom|last=Bartlett|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/What-s-So-Dangerous-About/242256|title=What’s So Dangerous About Jordan Peterson?|date=January 17, 2018|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|access-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NP18"&gt;{{cite news|first=Christie|last=Blatchford|author-link=Christie Blatchford|url=http://nationalpost.com/feature/christie-blatchford-sits-down-with-warrior-for-common-sense-jordan-peterson|title=Christie Blatchford sits down with "warrior for common sense" Jordan Peterson|date=January 19, 2018|work=[[National Post]]|access-date=January 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lott18"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Lott|author-link=Tim Lott|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/jan/21/jordan-peterson-self-help-author-12-steps-interview|title=Jordan Peterson: ‘The pursuit of happiness is a pointless goal’|date=January 21, 2018|work=[[The Observer]]|access-date=January 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, "compelled speech" had become a "very divisive subject within the Ontario law profession" and was the object of much tension.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail_Woolf_2018"/&gt; Peterson's talks on university campuses, such as Queen's University, with its [[Queen's University Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]], have been controversial.&lt;ref name="theglobeandmail_Woolf_2018"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-why-we-invited-jordan-peterson-to-discuss-compelled-speech/ |title=Why we invited Jordan Peterson to discuss compelled speech |first=Daniel |last=Woolf |newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=March 12, 2018 |access-date=July 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

[[Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] protects the right of freedom of expression, and [[Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998|section 3(1) of the Human Rights Act 1998]], requires that as far as possible all legislation is given effect in a way which is compatible with this. In ''[[LGBT_rights_in_Northern_Ireland#Ashers_Bakery_case|Lee vs Ashers Baking Company Ltd]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] considered whether a bakery in [[Northern Ireland]] had violated anti-discrimination law by refusing to decorate a cake with a message in support of [[gay marriage]], with which the bakers disagreed on religious grounds. They held that although the bakery may have discriminated on the basis of the customer's political beliefs, which would in itself contravene the [[Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2017-0020-judgment.pdf Judgment], part III&lt;/ref&gt;, the legislation had to be "read down" in a way which would not violate the defendants' Article 10 rights, taken to include the right ''not'' to express a particular opinion. The right in Article 9 is a limited right because it permits restrictions on free speech that are necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of a legitimate aim, but the Supreme Court found that no such justification existed in this case.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', part IV&lt;/ref&gt; (The court also considered whether the defendants had discriminated based on sexual orientation, but because they concluded that they had not done, the court did not need to consider whether the relevant legislation should be similarly read down.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid'', Part II.&lt;/ref&gt;)

During [[The Killing Time]] of the 1680s an [[Abjuration Oath]] could be put to suspects where they were given the option to [[Abjuration|abjure]] or renounce their allegiances. The terms of the oath were deliberately designed to offend the consciences of the [[Presbyterian]] [[Covenanters]]. Those who would not swear "whether they have arms, or not" could be "immediately killed" by field trial "before two witnesses" on a charge of high treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wodrow |first1=Robert |title=The history of the sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution |date=1832 |publisher=Blackie |location=Glasgow |pages=154-155 |edition=Vol IV |url=https://archive.org/stream/thehistoryofthes04wodruoft#page/n163/search/refusing+to+answer |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brown (Covenanter)|John Brown]] was included among those executed in this judicial process by John Graham (Bluidy Clavers) on 1 May 1685.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Terry |first1=Charles Sanford |title=John Graham of Claverhouse, viscount of Dundee, 1648-1689 |date=1905 |publisher=A.

Many [[definitions of terrorism]] exist, but there is no consensus on a single, universal definition. For example, Kydd and Walter define terrorism as "the use of violence against civilians by non-state actors to attain political goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kydd|first1=Andrew H.|last2=Walter|first2=Barbara F.|title=The Strategies of Terrorism|journal=The MIT Press|date=Summer 2006|volume=31|issue=1|pages=49–80|jstor=4137539|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Department of State defines terrorism as "premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents." On the other hand, the FBI's Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as "The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=U.S. Department of Justice|title=Terrorism 2002/2005|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005|website=FBI}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of a universal definition of terrorism has led to controversies, making it sometimes difficult to label a certain attack as a terrorist incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Mike|title=The legal definition of terrorism threatens to criminalise us all|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/the-legal-definition-of-terrorism-threatens-to-criminalise-us-all-9626325.html|accessdate=May 16, 2017|publisher=Independent|date=July 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Tarik Kafala, head of BBC Arabic insists journalists must stop using the term "terrorist", because it is a "value-laden" term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherwin|first1=Adam|title=BBC Arabic head Tarik Kafala on the channel's increasing significance in the modern world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/opinion/bbc-arabic-head-tarik-kafala-on-the-channels-increasing-significance-in-the-modern-world-10001667.html|publisher=The Independent|date=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there have been controversies, such as Obama's refusal to use the phrase, "Islamic terrorism", with political implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diaz|first1=Daniella|title=Obama: Why I won't say 'Islamic terrorism'|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/28/politics/obama-radical-islamic-terrorism-cnn-town-hall/|publisher=CNN|date=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vagueness of Definition==
There are several problems with the [[definition of terrorism]].

''No universally accepted definition''

There is no universally accepted definition of terrorism. In his paper, "Defining Terrorism: Is One Man's Terrorist Another Man's Freedom Fighter?", Boaz Ganor points out the urgency of an internationally accepted definition of terrorism due to the ambiguousness of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ganor|first1=Boaz|title=Defining Terrorism: Is One Man's Terrorist another Man's Freedom Fighter?|journal=Police Practice and Research|date=2002|volume=3|issue=4|pages=287–304|doi=10.1080/1561426022000032060|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1561426022000032060|accessdate=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even within the country of the United States, the US Department of State and the FBI have different definitions of terrorism, which can lead one institute to classify an event as terrorist while another does not.

''Vague wording''

Another issue with the definition of terrorism is its vague wording. Navin Bapat, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and expert on terrorist campaigns, points out the subjective nature of words used in definitions of terrorism, such as "non-combatant" and "political purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peralta|first1=Eyder|title=When Is An Act Of Violence An Act Of Terrorism?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/17/423881551/when-is-an-act-of-violence-an-act-of-terrorism|publisher=NPR|date=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjectivity of such words allows for dispute over whether a group is or is not terrorist, as questions such as the degree to which the attack was pre-meditated, the degree to which a subnational group was involved with the premeditation of the attack, or the definition of a "non-combatant" and what ideologies are considered "political" may arise.

''Examples''

[[Steve Biko]] was a South African [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] activist who believed that some violence against whites was inevitable while apartheid remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Woods|first1=Donald|title=Biko|date=1978|publisher=NewYork and London: Paddington Press|isbn=0-8050-1899-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leading figure of the [[South African Students' Organization]], and participated in founding the [[Black People's Convention]]. According to many definitions of terrorism, including the US Department of State and Kydd &amp; Walter as well as the [[Terrorism Act, 1967|Terrorism Act]] of South Africa at the time, Steve Biko's activities qualified as terrorism. Steve Biko was arrested under the South African Terrorism Act, and died while in custody. Today, Steve Biko is appraised as a hero - &lt;ref&gt;Ahluwalia and Zegeye described him as "an articulate and visionary black South African intellectual and hero"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahluwalia|first1=Pal|last2=Zegeye|first2=Abebe|title=Frantz Fanon and Steve Biko: Towards Liberation|journal=Social Identities|date=2001|volume=7|issue=3|pages=455–469|doi=10.1080/1350463012008726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manning Marable and Peniel Joseph also referred to him as "one of South Africa's greatest fighters - and martyrs - for freedom." In a public vote in 2004, Steve Biko was elected 13th of [[SABC3's Great South Africans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marable|first1=Manning|last2=Joseph|first2=Peniel|title=Series Editors' Preface: Steve Biko and the International Context of Black Consciousness|date=2008|publisher=New York and Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-0-230-60519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example illustrates the fact that some "terrorists" may become heroes when alternate perspectives are acknowledged.

Similarly, the [[Edelweiss Pirates]] were a group of youth that stood up against the [[Nazi regime]], sometimes using violence. Some of the members were arrested and executed for conspiring to plant a bomb at the [[Gestapo]] headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Macey|first1=Jennifer|title=Campaigning for Cologne's Maligned Resistance|url=http://www.dw.com/en/campaigning-for-colognes-maligned-resistance/a-1391096|website=DW|publisher=Deutsche Welle}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the definition of terrorism as outlined by the US Department of State, this group can be categorized as terrorist, as they are a subnational group that planned politically-motivated violence against noncombatant targets. In 2005, however, the German authorities gave official recognition to the [[Edelweiss Pirates]] as resistance heroes after 60 years of denouncing them as a criminal organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Teenage rebels who fought Nazis are honoured at last|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/1492771/Teenage-rebels-who-fought-Nazis-are-honoured-at-last.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=June 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that German authorities may recognize as heroes a group that not only was once considered a criminal group but can also presently qualify as a terrorist group, clearly demonstrates the vagueness of the various definitions of terrorism currently used by different institutions around the world.

A more recent and more controversial example is the [[2016 Orlando Nightclub Shooting]]. Though it has been established that the shooter, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to ISIS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellis|first1=Ralph|title=Orlando shooting: 49 killed, shooter pledged ISIS allegiance|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/12/us/orlando-nightclub-shooting/|publisher=CNN|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no evidence that ISIS provided operational support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malsin|first1=Jared|title=What to Know About ISIS's Role in the Orlando Shooting|url=http://time.com/4365507/orlando-shooting-isis-claims-responsibility-terror/|publisher=TIME|date=June 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this incident is to be labeled "terrorist" according to the definition of terrorism as defined by the US Department of State, Mateen must be acting as an agent of ISIS. However, ISIS lack of direct involvement in the premeditation and execution of the attack provides complications.

==Islam and Terrorism==
{{See also|Islamic Terrorism}}

Much controversy exists over the association of Islam with terrorism. Since the [[September 11 Attacks]], any act of violence has been prone to being labeled as "terrorist" if the perpetrator is Muslim, regardless of the intentions and organization details of the attack, rendering the definitions of terrorism void. For example, the [[2017 Westminster Attack]] has been described as a terrorist attack by various media agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen|first1=Emily|last2=Henderson|first2=Barney|title=Westminster Attack - Everything We Know So Far About the Events in london|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/03/22/westminster-terror-attack-everything-know-far/|publisher=The Telegraph|date=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith-Spark|first1=Laura|title=Westminster Attack: What You Need to Know|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/22/europe/uk-parliament-incident-what-happened/|publisher=CNN|date=March 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as with the [[2016 Orlando Nightclub Shooting]], no evidence linking the Khalid Massood, the attacker, to terrorist organizations has been found. Similarly, the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting]] sparked controversy when Tarik Kafala, head of [[BBC Arabic]], claimed that the attack must not be labeled as one of terrorist nature by the media because the term "terrorist" is value-laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turner|first1=Camilla|title=We must not call Charlie Hebdo killers 'terrorists', says BBC boss|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11369104/We-must-not-call-Charlie-Hebdo-killers-terrorists-says-BBC-boss.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Muslims have been subject to particular scrutiny. In their paper, "‘I’m a Muslim, but I'm not a Terrorist’: Victimization, Risky Identities and the Performance of Safety", Mythen, Walkate &amp; Khan highlight the risk, identity, and experience of victimization that British Muslims encounter due to the current discourse on terrorism, which is biased towards Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mythen|first1=Gabe|last2=Walkate|first2=Sandra|last3=Khan|first3=Fatima|title=‘I’m a Muslim, but I'm not a Terrorist’: Victimization, Risky Identities and the Performance of Safety|journal=The British Journal of Criminology|date=2009|volume=49|issue=6|pages=736–754|doi=10.1093/bjc/azp032|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/49/6/736/408706/I-m-a-Muslim-but-I-m-not-a-Terrorist-Victimization|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kosic and Nordio point out how the discourse on terrorism has created a tension between self and the "Other" in Europe, creating difficulties in communities' acceptance of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosic|first1=Marianna|last2=Nordio|first2=Daria|title=Perception and construction of "otherness" biased by fear|journal=IUIES-International University Institute for European Studies University of Trieste|date=2007|url=http://www.eisa-net.org/be-bruga/eisa/files/events/turin/Kosic-kosic_nordio_2007_perception_and_construction_of_otherness_biased_by_fear.pdf|accessdate=May 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such isolation of the Muslim community has led to scandalous incidents, particularly in airports and aircraft. For example, in August, 2016, three siblings were removed from an EasyJet flight from Stansted to Naples after being falsely accused of reading [[ISIS]] materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grierson|first1=Jamie|title=Trio forced off easyJet plane over false claims they support Isis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/aug/24/dharas-siblings-forced-off-easyjet-plane-stansted-accused-supporting-isis?CMP=share_btn_tw|accessdate=May 12, 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=August 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim communities have also experienced hate crimes, such as when an arsonist set fire at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce.

==Political Implications==
Governments can use the label and definitions of terrorism to convince the public that measures are being taken to protect them. For example, terrorism can be addressed as either a military problem or a criminal problem. [[President George W. Bush]] categorized terrorists as militants by declaring a [[war on terrorism]], while [[President Barack Obama]] used counter-terrorist measures rather than military measures. Governments can also use the label to isolate groups. Isolated groups may be oppressed, discriminated against, and delegitimized.

The isolation of groups by labeling them as terrorist has led to a division between the in-group and out-group, causing mistrust and caution towards immigration. This phenomenon is leading to the rise of extreme-right leaning candidates in Europe, particularly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/europe-crosshairs-political-implications-terror|title=Europe in the Crosshairs: Political Implications of Terror|website=CSIS|publisher=Center for Strategic and International Studies|last1=Nilsson|first1=Carl Hvenmark|accessdate=May 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[President Donald J. Trump]] has called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States and a registry of the US Muslim population, citing terrorism as justification. Reports from the Southern Poverty Law Center claim that Trump’s campaign contributed to the tripling of hate groups against Muslims from 34 in 2015 to 101 in 2016. The FBI found that hate crimes against Muslims increased by 67% in 2015. The SPLC documented over 300 bias-related incidents targeting immigrants or Muslims in the first 10 days after Trump’s election. 80% out of 10,000 educators reported more intense anxiety and fear among immigrant students and Muslim students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=England|first1=Charlotte|title=Donald Trump blamed for massive spike in Islamophobic hate crime|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-blame-islamophobic-anti-muslim-ban-hate-crime-numbers-southern-poverty-law-center-a7582846.html|accessdate=May 12, 2017|publisher=The Independent|date=February 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is Israel's political actions. Israel labels [[Palestinian political violence]] against them as terrorist, which allows Israel to reject negotiation. On the other hand, when Israel executed [[Operation Wooden Leg]] on Tunisia, leaving 47 dead and 65 wounded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/03/world/tunisia-s-leader-bitter-at-the-us.html|title=TUNISIA'S LEADER BITTER AT THE U.S.|last=Times|first=Frank J. Prial, Special To The New York|date=1985-10-03|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-20|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; the US's initial statement claimed that it was a "legitimate response to terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/03/world/tunisia-s-leader-bitter-at-the-us.html|title=TUNISIA'S LEADER BITTER AT THE U.S.|last=Times|first=Frank J.

In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], for any object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in any [[category (mathematics)|category]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; where the [[product (category theory)|product]] &lt;math&gt;a\times a&lt;/math&gt; exists, [[there exists]] the '''diagonal morphism''' 

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_a : a \rightarrow a \times a&lt;/math&gt;

satisfying 

:&lt;math&gt;\pi_k \circ \delta_a = id_a&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k \in \{ 1,2 \},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\pi_k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[canonical projection morphism]] to the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th component. The existence of this morphism is a consequence of the [[universal property]] which [[characterization (mathematics)|characterize]]s the product ([[up to]] [[isomorphism]]). The restriction to binary products here is for ease of notation; diagonal morphisms exist similarly for arbitrary products. The [[image (category theory)|image]] of a diagonal morphism in the [[category of sets]], as a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]], is a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] on the [[domain of a function|domain]], namely [[equality (mathematics)|equality]].

For [[concrete categories]], the diagonal morphism can be simply described by its action on elements &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; of the object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Namely, &lt;math&gt;\delta_a(x) = \langle x,x \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, the [[ordered pair]] formed from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The reason for the name is that the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of such a diagonal morphism is diagonal (whenever it makes sense), for example the image of the diagonal morphism &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; on the [[real line]] is given by the line which is a [[graph of a function|graph]] of the equation &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;. The diagonal morphism into the [[infinite product]] &lt;math&gt;X^\infty&lt;/math&gt; may provide an [[Injective function|injection]] into the [[space of sequences]] valued in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;; each element maps to the constant [[sequence]] at that element. However, most notions of sequence spaces have [[convergent series|convergence]] restrictions which the image of the diagonal map will fail to satisfy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2522">In [[mathematics]], '''Esakia duality''' is the [[equivalence of categories|dual equivalence]] between the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[Heyting algebra]]s and the category of [[Esakia space]]s. Esakia duality provides an order-topological representation of Heyting algebras via Esakia spaces.

Let '''Esa''' denote the category of Esakia spaces and [[Esakia space#Esakia morphisms|Esakia morphisms]].

Let {{math|''H''}} be a Heyting algebra, {{math|''X''}} denote the set of [[prime ideal|prime filters]] of {{math|''H''}}, and {{math|&amp;le;}} denote set-theoretic inclusion on the prime filters of {{math|''H''}}. Also, for each {{math|''a''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt; ''H''}}, let {{math|''&amp;phi;''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;{{=}}&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''x''}}}, and let {{math|''&amp;tau;''}} denote the topology on {{math|''X''}} generated by {{math| {''&amp;phi;''(''a''),&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''&amp;phi;''(''a'')&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;small&gt;&amp;isin;&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''H''}}}.

Theorem:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Esakia|first=Leo|date=1974|title=Topological kripke models|journal=Soviet Math|volume=15|issue=1|pages=147-151}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|(''X'', ''&amp;tau;'', &amp;le;)}} is an Esakia space, called the ''Esakia dual'' of {{math|''H''}}. Moreover, {{math|''&amp;phi;''}} is a Heyting algebra [[isomorphism]] from {{math|''H''}} onto the Heyting algebra of all [[clopen set|clopen]] [[up-set]]s of {{math|(''X'',''&amp;tau;'',&amp;le;)}}. Furthermore, each Esakia space is isomorphic in '''Esa''' to the Esakia dual of some Heyting algebra.

This representation of Heyting algebras by means of Esakia spaces is [[functorial]] and yields a dual equivalence between the category '''HA''' of Heyting algebras and Heyting algebra [[homomorphisms]] and the category '''Esa''' of Esakia spaces and Esakia morphisms.

==History==
In Eugenics there is a focus on women as the bearers of the future “race.” In [[Francis Galton|Galton]]'s original formulation of eugenics women were seen as a mere conduit to pass "genius" from father to son, however as the movement progressed there was increasing importance placed on women as “mothers of the race”.  The emphasis of women in eugenics led eventually to eugenicist [[Caleb Saleeby]] (1878-1940) coining the term “'''eugenic feminism'''” in ''Woman and Womanhood: A Search for Principles''&lt;ref name="Saleeby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wsuffrage"&gt;{{cite web |title=Woman suffrage, eugenics, and eugenic feminism in Canada «  Women Suffrage and Beyond |url=http://womensuffrage.org/?p=22106 |website=womensuffrage.org |accessdate=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428163310/http://womensuffrage.org/?p=22106 |archive-date=2017-04-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Saleeby disagreeing with some [[sexist]] eugenic principles, in light of new research on heredity at the time notes that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If it were true that woman is merely the vessel and custodian of the future lives of men and women, entrusted to her antenatal care by their fathers, as many creeds have supposed, then indeed it would be a question of relatively small moment how the mothers of the future were chosen.[...]

But directly we observe, under the microscope, the facts of development, we discover that each
parent contributes an exactly equal share to the making of the new individual, and all the ancient and modern ideas of the superior value of well-selected fatherhood fall to the ground. Woman is indeed half the race.[...]

And thus it matters for the future at least as much how the mothers are chosen as how the fathers are.[...]
Woman is half the race; and the leaders of the woman's movement must recognize the importance of their sex in this fundamental question of eugenics.

There is possible no Eugenic Feminism which shall satisfy those whose simple argument is that woman must have what she wants, just as man must.[...]

No one will question that the position and happiness and self-realization of women in the modern world would be vastly enhanced by the reforms for which I plead, though some men will not think that game worth the candle.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the turn of the 20th century as the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement began, and eugenic feminists used eugenics in the argument for being granted the right to vote.  They argued that not only must their social conditions be ameliorated in order to improve the human race, but also that they must be given power as women’s moral superiority toward social space made them uniquely suited to cleaning up corruption.&lt;ref name="wsuffrage"/&gt; Devereux characterizes Saleeby's invention of "Eugenic Feminism" as "at least partly a deceptive rhetorical strategy" whose goal was to "draw middle-class women's rights activists ''back'' to home and duty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Devereux |first=Cecily |title=Growing a Race: Nellie L. McClung and the Fiction of Eugenic Feminism |publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=9780773573048 |oclc=243600906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different versions of eugenic feminism arose between 1890 and 1930, but each shared in the argument that the eugenic decline of the race could be prevented only if women were granted greater political, social, sexual, and economic equality.

In the 1930s eugenic feminism began to decline as eugenic feminists began to fall out with mainstream eugenicists, and had largely failed to sway the public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ziegler |first1=Mary |title=Eugenic Feminism: Mental Hygiene, the Women's Movement, and the Campaign for Eugenic Legal Reform, 1900-1935 |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Gender |date=2008 |volume=31 |page=211 |language=en |quote=Several different visions of eugenic feminism were articulated between 1890 and 1930, but each found commonality in the argument that the eugenic decline of the race could be prevented only if women were granted greater political, social, sexual, and economic equality. This argument correlated gender equality with racial improvement: eugenic science and law had to guarantee some form of substantive gender equality in order to improve the race.  Thus, in the years between 1915 and 1935, eugenic feminism existed distinct from, and in increasing tension with, mainstream eugenic science and policy. Ultimately, leading eugenic feminists could neither change the minds of a majority of the eugenic coalition nor resolve the contradictions inherent in their own eugenic theories. While they often argued that their reforms should be supported primarily as means to achieve a eugenic end, each leader held on to the very kinds of rights and equality-based arguments that mainstream eugenicists rejected. This contradiction contributed significantly to the decline and disappearance of eugenic feminism in the early and mid-1930s.|ssrn=1646393 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Canada==
In Canada, all members of the suffragist group known as the "[[The Famous Five (Canada)|Famous Five]]" were known to support eugenics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feminism |url=http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/tree/52336b0a5c2ec50000000049 |website=The Eugenics Archives |accessdate=31 October 2018 |language=en |quote=All of the Famous Five were also involved in the race hygiene movement and supported the passage of the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Emily Murphy]] and [[Nellie McClung]], the latter notably supporting the [[Sexual_Sterilization_Act_of_Alberta|1928 Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta]] and the [[Compulsory_sterilization_in_Canada#British_Columbia|1933 Sexual Sterilization Act of British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="eu-arch"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rosario |first1=Esther |title=Feminism |url=http://eugenicsarchive.ca/discover/tree/52336b0a5c2ec50000000049 |website=The Eugenics Archives |accessdate=27 October 2018 |language=en |date=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United Kingdom==
&lt;blockquote&gt;British eugenicists such as [[Caleb Saleeby]], [[Karl Pearson]], and [[Havelock Ellis]], held that women were essentially reproductive agents.[...] Proponents of mainstream eugenics and some early advocates of women’s rights found common ground. Not all early feminists supported eugenic practices, but the notion of social advancement as intricately tied to reproduction was central to both eugenicists and early feminists.[...] Some suffragists advocated for staunch immigration policies and eugenic practices such as mental hygiene and the social segregation and sexual sterilization of the “feeble-minded.”&lt;ref name="eu-arch"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the United Kingdom [[Marie Stopes]] an early feminist, founded the first birth control clinic in the UK in 1921. Stopes was opposed to abortion and contraception, preferring that "unfit" children were not conceived in the first place.  In 1920 Stopes wrote “I would legislate compulsory sterilization of the insane, feeble minded… revolutionaries… half castes”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eugenics and Feminism - A Brief History |url=http://dangerouswomenproject.org/2017/02/28/eugenics-and-feminism/ |website=Dangerous Women Project |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=28 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322223322/http://dangerouswomenproject.org/2017/02/28/eugenics-and-feminism/ |archive-date=2018-03-22 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States==
{{see| Eugenics in the United States#Planned Parenthood and the African American community}}
In the United states some feminists advocated for legal reform involving some aspects of eugenics, notably ''The National Federation of Women's Clubs'', the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], and the [[National League of Women Voters]] had at some point lobbied for eugenic legislation.&lt;ref name=Ziegler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ziegler|first=Mary|title=Eugenic Feminism: Mental Hygiene, The Women's Movement, And The Campaign For Eugenic Legal Reform, 1900–1935|journal=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Gender|year=2008|volume=31|issue=1|pages=211–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most prominent feminists to push for eugenics was [[Margaret Sanger]], the leader of the American [[birth control]] movement.&lt;ref name=nyu&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/newsletter/articles/sanger-hitler_equation.html "The Sanger-Hitler Equation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921080638/http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sanger/secure/newsletter/articles/sanger-hitler_equation.html |date=2011-09-21 }}, ''[[Margaret Sanger Papers Project]] Newsletter'', #32, Winter 2002/3.

In the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] tradition, the '''five hindrances''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''पञ्च निवरण pañca nivāraṇa''; [[Pali]]: ''{{IAST|पञ्च नीवरणानि pañca nīvaraṇāni}}'') are identified  as [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] that hinder progress in [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]] and in our daily lives.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}} In the [[Theravada]] tradition, these factors are identified specifically as obstacles to the [[jhāna]]s (stages of concentration) within meditation practice. Within the [[Mahayana]] tradition, the five hindrances are identified as obstacles to [[samatha]] (tranquility) meditation. Contemporary [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation]] teachers identify the five hindrances as obstacles to [[mindfulness meditation]].

The five hindrances are:{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=26}}{{sfn|Wallace|2006|pp=158-159}}&lt;ref group=web name=b2001/&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
# Sensory desire (''[[kāma]]&lt;nowiki&gt;cchanda&lt;/nowiki&gt;''): the particular type of wanting that seeks for happiness through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and physical feeling.
# Ill-will (''vyāpāda''; also spelled ''byāpāda''):  all kinds of thought related to wanting to reject; feelings of hostility, resentment, hatred and bitterness.
# Sloth-and-torpor (''[[thīna]]-[[middha]]''): heaviness of body and dullness of mind which drag one down into disabling inertia and thick depression.
# Restlessness-and-worry (''[[uddhacca]]-[[kukkucca]]''): the inability to calm the mind.
# Doubt (''[[vicikicchā]]''): lack of conviction or trust.

==Overview==

===Within the Buddhist traditions===
The five hindrances are identified in the major Buddhist traditions of [[Theravada Buddhism]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]], as well in the contemporary [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation]] tradition. But the hindrances are presented differently within these different traditions, depending upon the way each tradition teaches the practice of meditation.

;Contemporary Insight Meditation:
Contemporary [[Insight Meditation Society|Insight Meditation]] teacher [[Gil Fronsdal]] describes the hindrances as "a very important list of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental states]] that have a big impact on meditation practice and people’s daily lives." Fronsdal emphasizes that it is important not to see the hindrances as personal failings. All human beings have them. A big part of mindfulness meditation is to learn about these hindrances in order to become free of them. Therefore, Fronsdal states, the goal is to not dismiss them, but to study them and understand them really well.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}

Contemporary teacher [[Jack Kornfield]] described the five hindrances as "difficult energies which arise in the mind and in one's life as a part of meditation practice."&lt;ref group=web name=k1&gt;[http://www.caringawareness.com/community/VolIII/Books/JK_Hindrances2.html The Five Hindrances-2 by Jack Kornfield] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026134307/http://www.caringawareness.com/community/VolIII/Books/JK_Hindrances2.html |date=2012-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Theravada tradition:
Contemporary Theravada scholar Nina van Gorkom states: "The hindrances are obstructions, overwhelming the mind, weakening insight.[...] The hindrances obstruct the development of what is wholesome."&lt;ref group=web name=nina1&gt;[https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/cetasikas/d/doc2873.html Different Groups Of Defilements Part II, Nina van Gorkom]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the Theravada tradition, the five hindrances are identified specifically as obstacles to the [[jhāna]]s (stages of concentration) within meditation. For example, contemporary Theravada teacher [[Ajahn Brahmavamso]] states:&lt;ref group=web name=b2001&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Gt5hSX0EGjkJ:www.dhammatalks.net/Books7/Ajahn_Brahm_Five_Hindrances.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjae0cxvWrUHJDKcwEZcvBx4XgEqWqqmk_0Y_nRqvACIxXjxwSh7pyCY00KOO0JW9DiKrPR_9XuNq-fZGUsqJbloC4xwLgZMfjltOqWSP8_bWvrksc_a5tjxJ9Acqea1jHfR3dm&amp;sig=AHIEtbRsGoEAn-GXCI-LWctEQin1flxZtg The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Brahmavamso (2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;
:The deliberate idea of overcoming these five hindrances is important because it is the five hindrances that block the door to both the jhānas, and wisdom. It’s the five hindrances that fuel [[avijjā]]. The Buddha said that they’re the nutriments, the food of delusion.

Ajahn Brahmavamso emphasizes that any obstacle that arises in meditation can be identified as one of the five hindrances; he states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
:Any problem which arises in meditation will be one of these Five Hindrances, or a combination. So, if one experiences any difficulty, use the scheme of the Five Hindrances as a 'check list' to identify the main problem. Then you will know the appropriate remedy, apply it carefully, and go beyond the obstacle into deeper meditation. When the Five Hindrances are fully overcome, there is no barrier between the meditator and the bliss of Jhana. Therefore, the certain test that these Five Hindrances are really overcome is the ability to access Jhana.

;Mahayana tradition:
Within the Mahayana tradition, the five hindrances are typically identified as obstacles to [[samatha]] meditation (also referred to as tranquility meditation).{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=26}}

===Overcoming the hindrances===
All of the Buddhist traditions emphasize that the hindrances are overcome by investigating and understanding them. For example, contemporary Theravada teacher [[Ajahn Sumedho]] states:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/sumedho/fivehind.html The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Sumedho]&lt;/ref&gt;
: In meditation one develops an understanding of the Five Hindrances -- how, when one of them is present, you investigate it, you understand it, you accept its presence and you learn how to deal with it. Sometimes you can just tell it to go away and it goes; sometimes you just have to allow it to be there till it wears out.

Contemporary Insight Meditation teacher Gil Fronsdal emphasizes that to be a good student of the hindrances, you must be very patient with them and not be dismissive of them. When they arise, you must stop for them. Fronsdal states that a bumper sticker for this type of training could be “I stop for the hindrances.” You don’t indulge them, Fronsdal states, you become interested and study them.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}

The Insight Meditation tradition teaches the RAIN formula for investigating the hindrances:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/FiveHindrances.pdf Introduction to Mindfulness Meditation: The Five Hindrances (study notes)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web name=brach&gt;[http://www.tarabrach.com/howtomeditate.html How to Meditate: A Guide to Formal Sitting Practice, by Tara Brach]&lt;/ref&gt;

* R: Recognize it.
* A: Accept it.
* I: Investigate it, be curious. What is it like?
* N: Non-identification. This is just a passing process that comes and goes, not who we are.

==The five hindrances individually==

===1. Sensory desire (kamacchanda) ===
The hindrance of sensory desire (''kamacchanda'') is latching onto thoughts or feelings based on the pleasures of the five senses.
* Ajahn Brahmavamso (1999) states: "Sensory desire refers to that particular type of wanting that seeks for happiness through the five senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and physical feeling. It specifically excludes any aspiration for happiness through the sixth sense of mind alone. In its extreme form, sensory desire is an obsession to find pleasure in such things as sexual intimacy, good food or fine music. But it also includes the desire to replace irritating or even painful five-sense experiences with pleasant ones, i.e. the desire for sensory comfort."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1&gt;[http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebmed051.htm The Five Hindrances, by Ajahn Brahmavamso (1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ajahn Brahmavamso (2001) states: "[...] kāma chanda are anything from the extremes of lust to just being concerned with how the body is doing. Thinking about the letter that you have to write afterwards, about the rain pattering on your roof, about your kutī [monk's hut], or what needs to be built next, or where you are going to next, that’s all in the kāmaloka, the world of the senses, that’s all kāma chanda. It’s also kāma vitakka, or the thoughts about those things, about family, about health, about coming here, going there, and thoughts about words.&lt;ref group=web name=b2001/&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2016}}
* Traleg Kyabgon states: "This term alludes to the mind's tendency to latch on to something that attracts it--a thought, a visual object, or a particular emotion. When we allow the mind to indulge in such attractions, we lose our concentration. So we need to apply mindfulness and be aware of how the mind operates; we don't necessarily have to suppress all these things arising in the mind, but we should take notice of them and see how the mind behaves, how it automatically grabs onto this and that."{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}

;Analogy
The hindrance of sensory desire is compared to taking out a loan – any pleasure one experiences through these five senses must be repaid through the unpleasantness of separation or loss which invariably follow when the pleasure is used up. There is also interest to be repaid on the loan. Thus, the Buddha said that the pleasure is small compared to the suffering repaid.&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;

;Antidote
In order to overcome the hindrance of sensory desire (''kamacchanda''), the meditator must first apply mindfulness and recognize that the hindrance is present.{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}&lt;ref group=web name=cards1&gt;[http://bodhicards.com/FIVE_HINDRANCES.html Five Hindrances Bodhi Cards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831220653/http://bodhicards.com/FIVE_HINDRANCES.html |date=August 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then one must look at the hindrance, analyze it, make it the object of our meditation, experience it fully. The meditator can then apply specific techniques such as contemplating the impermanence of the pleasant desire.&lt;ref group=web name=cards1/&gt;
 
Ajahn Brahmavamso emphasizes the technique of letting go of concern for the body and the five senses completely; he states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
:In meditation, one transcends sensory desire for the period by letting go of concern for this body and its five sense activity. Some imagine that the five senses are there to serve and protect the body, but the truth is that the body is there to serve the five senses as they play in the world ever seeking delight. Indeed, the Lord Buddha once said, "The five senses ARE the world" and to leave the world, to enjoy the other worldly bliss of Jhana, one must give up for a time ALL concern for the body and its five senses.

;Etymology
Kamacchanda can be compared to giving your approval for ''[[kāma]]''-based thoughts and emotions to remain in your mind. It is allowing these thoughts to occupy your mind. Ajahn Brahmavamso explains:&lt;ref group=web name=b2001/&gt;
:In the Pāli term ''kāma chanda'', ''chanda'' is what you have to do if you cannot attend a meeting of the community of monks, and you want to give approval and agreement to what’s happening there, you give your ''chanda'' to go ahead in your absence. It’s agreement, approval, consent, and it’s much more subtle than mere desire. This means that you are buying into, giving in to this, you want it, you approve of it, and you allow it to happen. In the same way that we have ''chanda'' in the Vinaya, we have that ''kāma chanda''. It’s as if you give your approval for the sensory world to be in your consciousness, in your mind, you accept it, approve of it, and you play with it, that’s all ''chanda''. It’s letting it completely occupy the mind, and it’s much more subtle than just mere desire. The kāma part of ''kāma chanda'', that’s all that is comprised in kāmaloka, the world of the five senses, which goes from the hell realms, the animal realms, the ghost realms, the human realm, and the Deva realms, to everything that is concerned with those kāmaloka realms. ''Kāma Chanda'' is acceptance, agreement, and consent for that world to occupy you.

===2. Ill will (vyapada) ===
The hindrance of ill will (''vyapada'') is latching onto thoughts or feelings based on anger, resentment, hostility, bitterness, etc.
* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "Ill will refers to the desire to punish, hurt or destroy. It includes sheer hatred of a person, or even a situation, and it can generate so much energy that it is both seductive and addictive. At the time, it always appears justified for such is its power that it easily corrupts our ability to judge fairly. It also includes ill will towards oneself, otherwise known as guilt, which denies oneself any possibility of happiness. In meditation, ill will can appear as dislike towards the meditation object itself, rejecting it so that one's attention is forced to wander elsewhere."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Traleg Kyabgon states: "The second hindrance is ''ill will''; it is the opposite of the first hindrance, being brought about by aversion rather than attraction. Ill will refers to all kinds of thought related to wanting to reject, feelings of hostility, resentment, hatred and bitterness. When they arise, we should take note of them, not necessarily suppressing them, but seeing how they arise."{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=25}}

;Analogy
The hindrance of ill will is compared to being sick. Just as sickness denies one the freedom and happiness of health, so ill will denies one the freedom and happiness of peace.&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;

;Antidote
The antidote to the hindrance of ill will (''vyapada'') is meditation on loving kindness (metta). Ajahn Brahmavamso states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
:Ill will is overcome by applying Metta, loving kindness. When it is ill will towards a person, Metta teaches one to see more in that person than all that which hurts you, to understand why that person hurt you (often because they were hurting intensely themselves), and encourages one to put aside one's own pain to look with compassion on the other. But if this is more than one can do, Metta to oneself leads one to refuse to dwell in ill will to that person, so as to stop them from hurting you further with the memory of those deeds. Similarly, if it is ill will towards oneself, Metta sees more than one's own faults, can understand one's own faults, and finds the courage to forgive them, learn from their lesson and let them go. Then, if it is ill will towards the meditation object (often the reason why a meditator cannot find peace) Metta embraces the meditation object with care and delight. For example, just as a mother has a natural Metta towards her child, so a meditator can look on their breath, say, with the very same quality of caring attention. Then it will be just as unlikely to lose the breath through forgetfulness as it is unlikely for a mother to forget her baby in the shopping mall, and it would be just as improbable to drop the breath for some distracting thought as it is for a distracted mother to drop her baby! When ill will is overcome, it allows lasting relationships with other people, with oneself and, in meditation, a lasting, enjoyable relationship with the meditation object, one that can mature into the full embrace of absorption.

===3. Sloth-torpor (thina-middha)===
{{see also|thīna|middha}}

Sloth-torpor is a dull, morbid state that is characterized by unwieldiness, lack of energy, and opposition to wholesome activity.

* Traleg Kyabgon states: "When this hindrance is present, we lose our focus in meditation. We may not be agitated in any perceptible way, but there is no mental clarity. We gradually become more and more drowsy, and then eventually go to sleep."{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}
* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "Sloth and torpor refers to that heaviness of body and dullness of mind which drag one down into disabling inertia and thick depression. [...] In meditation, it causes weak and intermittent mindfulness which can even lead to falling asleep in meditation without even realising it!"&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "The mind has two main functions, 'doing' and 'knowing'. The way of meditation is to calm the 'doing' to complete tranquility while maintaining the 'knowing'. Sloth and torpor occur when one carelessly calms both the 'doing' and the 'knowing', unable to distinguish between them."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "Sloth and torpor is an unpleasant state of body and mind, too stiff to leap into the bliss of Jhana and too blinded to spot any insights. In short, it is a complete waste of precious time."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;

;Analogy:
The hindrance of sloth-torpor is compared to being imprisoned in a cramped, dark cell, unable to move freely in the bright sunshine outside.&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;

;Antidote:
Ajahn Brahmavamso states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
: "Sloth and torpor is overcome by rousing energy. Energy is always available but few know how to turn on the switch, as it were. Setting a goal, a reasonable goal, is a wise and effective way to generate energy, as is deliberately developing interest in the task at hand. A young child has a natural interest, and consequent energy, because its world is so new. Thus, if one can learn to look at one's life, or one's meditation, with a 'beginner's mind' one can see ever new angles and fresh possibilities which keep one distant from sloth and torpor, alive and energetic. Similarly, one can develop delight in whatever one is doing by training one's perception to see the beautiful in the ordinary, thereby generating the interest which avoids the half-death that is sloth and torpor. [...] Sloth and torpor is a common problem which can creep up and smother one slowly. A skilful meditator keeps a sharp look-out for the first signs of sloth and torpor and is thus able to spot its approach and take evasive action before it's too late. Like coming to a fork in a road, one can take that mental path leading away from sloth and torpor."

Traleg Kyabgon states: "When this happens, instead of persisting with the meditation, it is better to try to refresh ourselves by getting up and going for a walk or washing our face, after which we return to our meditation."{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|p=26}}

===4. Restlessness-worry (uddhacca-kukkucca)===
{{see also|uddhacca|kukkucca}}

The hindrance of restlessness-worry (''uddhacca-kukkucca'') refers to a mind that is agitated and unable to settle down.

* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "Restlessness [uddhacca] refers to a mind which is like a monkey, always swinging on to the next branch, never able to stay long with anything. It is caused by the fault-finding state of mind which cannot be satisfied with things as they are, and so has to move on to the promise of something better, forever just beyond. [...] Remorse [kukkucca] refers to a specific type of restlessness which is the kammic effect of one's misdeeds."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Traleg Kyabgon states: "The fourth hindrance is ''restlessness and worry'', which refers to all the mental activities that go on in our mind due to its restless nature."{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}
* Gil Fronsdal states: "The discomfort of restlessness creates an outward looking [tendency] – what can I do to fix this? What can I do to settle this? [...] So the challenge in restlessness is how to turn towards it and be present for it and engage it."&lt;ref group=web name=gil01&gt;[http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1808/ ''The Five Hindrances: Restlessness and Worry'' audio talk by Gil Fronsdal]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Analogy:
Restlessness (''uddhacca'') is compared to being a slave, continually having to jump to the orders of a tyrannical boss who always demands perfection and so never lets one stop.&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;

;Antidote:
* Ajahn Brahmavamso states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
** Restlessness [uddhacca] is overcome by developing contentment, which is the opposite of fault-finding. One learns the simple joy of being satisfied with little, rather than always wanting more. One is grateful for this moment, rather than picking out its deficiencies. For instance, in meditation restlessness is often the impatience to move quickly on to the next stage. The fastest progress, though is achieved by those who are content with the stage they are on now. It is the deepening of that contentment that ripens into the next stage. 
** Remorse [kukkucca] refers to a specific type of restlessness which is the kammic effect of one's misdeeds. The only way to overcome remorse, the restlessness of a bad conscience, is to purify one's virtue and become kind, wise and gentle. It is virtually impossible for the immoral or the self-indulgent to make deep progress in meditation.
* Gil Fronsdal states: "[There are] a variety of ways to engage restlessness, be present for it. [...] [One is] learning, reflecting, meditating and contemplating what the nature of restlessness is. [...] There might be a really good cause for you to be restless. [...] Maybe you haven't paid your taxes in ten years. [...] [In this case] you don't need meditation, you need to pay your taxes. You don't use meditation to run away from the real issues of your life. [...] Sometimes what's needed is to really look and understand are there root causes for being restless."&lt;ref group=web name=gil01/&gt;

===5. Doubt (vicikicchā)===
{{see also|vicikicchā}}

The hindrance of doubt (''vicikicchā'') refers to doubt about one's ability to understand and implement the meditation instructions, as well as about the teacher and Buddhist teachings in general.

* Ajahn Brahmavamso states: "Doubt refers to the disturbing inner questions at a time when one should be silently moving deeper. Doubt can question one's own ability 'Can I do This?,' or question the method 'Is this the right way?,' or even question the meaning 'What is this?.' It should be remembered that such questions are obstacles to meditation because they are asked at the wrong time and thus become an intrusion, obscuring one's clarity."&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Traleg Kyabgon states: "When we meditate in the presence of this hindrance, we have a constant nagging feeling: 'How do I know what I am doing is right? How do I know if this thing really works and if I am not just wasting my time? How do I know what the Buddhist teachings say is true? How do I know if that what the meditation teachers have taught me is right and that they are not deluded?'"{{sfn|Traleg Kyabgon|2001|pp=25-26}}

;Analogy:
Doubt is compared to being lost in a desert, not recognising any landmarks.

;Antidote:
Ajahn Brahmavamso states:&lt;ref group=web name=brahma1/&gt;
* Such doubt is overcome by gathering clear instructions, having a good map, so that one can recognise the subtle landmarks in the unfamiliar territory of deep meditation and so know which way to go. Doubt in one's ability is overcome by nurturing self-confidence with a good teacher. A meditation teacher is like a coach who convinces the sports team that they can succeed.
* The end of doubt, in meditation, is described by a mind which has full trust in the silence, and so doesn't interfere with any inner speech. Like having a good chauffeur, one sits silently on the journey out of trust in the driver.

==Mental factors that counteract the five hindrances==
B. Alan Wallace identifies five mental factors that counteract the five hindrances, according to the Theravada tradition:{{sfn|Wallace|2006|pp=158-159}}
# ''Coarse examination ([[vitakka]])'' counteracts sloth-torpor (lethargy and drowsiness)
# ''Precise investigation ([[vicāra]])'' counteracts doubt (uncertainty)
# ''Well-being ([[pīti]])'' counteracts ill-will (malice)
# ''Bliss ([[sukha]])'' counteracts restlessness-worry (excitation and anxiety)
# ''Single-pointed attention ([[ekaggatā]])'' counteracts sensory desire

These five counteracting factors arise during the first [[Dhyāna in Buddhism#Stages of jhāna|jhāna]] (stage of concentration).

==In Pali Literature==

===In the Pali Canon===
In the [[Pali Canon]]'s [[Samyutta Nikaya]], several discourses juxtapose the five hindrances with the [[seven factors of enlightenment]] (''bojjhanga'').{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For example, in [[Samyutta Nikaya]] chapter 46, ''Bojjhanga-samyutta'', discourses 46.31 through 46.40 are based on this juxtaposition (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1589-94).}}  For instance, according to [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.37, [[the Buddha]] stated:
:"[[Bhikkhu]]s, there are these five obstructions, hindrances, corruptions of the mind, weakeners of wisdom.  What five? Sensual desire... ill will... sloth and torpor ... restlessness and remorse... doubt....
:"There are, bhikkhus, these seven factors of enlightenment, which are nonobstructions, nonhindrances, noncorruptions of the mind; when developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of true knowledge and liberation.  What seven? The enlightenment factor of mindfulness... [discrimination of states... energy... rapture... tranquility... concentration...] equanimity....&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), pp. 1591-92&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Bodhi (2000) elides the middle five factors of enlightenment, inserted here in square brackets, since all seven factors of enlightenment are identified previously multiple times in Bodhi's text.}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Anālayo (2006), pp. 239-40, underlines:
:"To overcome the hindrances, to practise ''[[satipatthana]]'', and to establish the awakening factors are, indeed, according to several Pali discourses, the key aspects and the distinctive features common to the awakenings of all Buddhas, past, present, and future."
Anālayo further supports this by identifying that, in all extant Sanskrit and Chinese versions of the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], only the five hindrances and seven factors of enlightenment are consistently identified under the ''dhamma'' contemplation section; contemplations of the [[five aggregates]], six [[sense base]]s and Four Noble Truths are not included in one or more of these non-Pali versions.}}

In terms of gaining [[vipassana|insight]] into and overcoming the Five Hindrances, according to the [[Satipatthana Sutta]], the Buddha proclaimed:
:How, monks, does a monk live contemplating mental objects in the mental objects of the five hindrances?

:Herein, monks, when sense-desire is present, a monk knows, "There is sense-desire in me," or when sense-desire is not present, he knows, "There is no sense-desire in me." He knows how the arising of the non-arisen sense-desire comes to be; he knows how the abandoning of the arisen sense-desire comes to be; and he knows how the non-arising in the future of the abandoned sense-desire comes to be.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.010.nysa.html Nyanasatta (1994).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the remaining four hindrances are similarly treated in subsequent paragraphs.

The Buddha gives the following analogies in the ''Samaññaphala Sutta'' ([[Digha Nikaya|DN]] 2, "The Fruits of the Contemplative Life"): 
:"... [W]hen these five hindrances are not abandoned in himself, the monk regards it as a debt, a sickness, a prison, slavery, a road through desolate country. But when these five hindrances are abandoned in himself, he regards it as unindebtedness, good health, release from prison, freedom, a place of security."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.02.0.than.html Thanissaro (1997).]&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Some correlate each individual hindrance with its sequentially matched metaphor, so that covetness is likened to being in debt, having ill will to sickness, sloth and torpor to imprisonment, having restlessness and anxiety to slavery, and doubt to traveling through uncertain terrain.}}

Similarly, in the ''Sa{{IAST|ṅ}}gārava Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.55), the Buddha compares sensual desire with looking for a clear reflection in water mixed with [[lac]], turmeric and dyes; ill will with boiling water; sloth-and-torpor with water covered with plants and algae; restlessness-and-worry with wind-churned water; and, doubt with water that is "turbid, unsettled, muddy, placed in the dark."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), pp. 1611-15; Walshe (1985), [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/walshe/wheel318.html#passage-60 sutta 60], pp. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the first-century CE exegetic ''[[Vimuttimagga]]'', the five hindrances include all ten "[[Fetters (Buddhism)|fetters]]": sense desire includes any attachment to passion; ill will includes all unwholesome states of hatred; and, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry, and doubt include all unwholesome states of infatuation.  The Vimuttimagga further distinguishes that "sloth" refers to mental states while "torpor" refers to physical states resultant from food or time or mental states; if torpor results from food or time, then one diminishes it through energy; otherwise, one removes it with meditation.  In addition, the Vimuttimagga identifies four types of doubt: 
* doubt regarding [[anatta|self]] is a hindrance to [[samatha|tranquility]];
* doubt regarding the [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[tiloka|three worlds]] is a hindrance to [[vipassana|insight]];
* doubt regarding the [[Triple Gem]] is a hindrance to both tranquility and insight;
* doubt regarding places and people is a hindrance to "non-doctrinal" things;
* doubt regarding the [[Tipitaka|Discourses]] is a hindrance to solitude.&lt;ref&gt;Upatissa ''et al.'' (1995), pp. 91-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Buddhaghosa]]'s fifth-century CE commentary to the [[Samyutta Nikaya]] (''{{IAST|Sāratthappakāsinī}}''), one can momentarily escape the hindrances through [[jhana|jhanic]] suppression or through [[vipassana|insight]] while, as also stated in the ''Vimuttimagga'', one eradicates the hindrances through attainment of one of the [[four stages of enlightenment]] (see Table 1).{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Regarding the ''{{IAST|Sāratthappakāsinī}}'' commentary, see Bodhi (2005), p. 440, ''n''. 14.  Regarding the ''Vimuttimagga'' commentary, see Upatissa ''et al.'' (1995), p. 316.}}

==Etymology==
According to Gil Fronsdal, the Pali term ''nīvaraṇa'' means covering. Fronsdal states that these hindrances cover over: the clarity of our mind, and our ability to be mindful, wise, concentrated, and stay on purpose.{{sfn|Fronsdal|2008|loc=The Five Hindrances: Introduction; 2008-10-13}}

According to Rhys Davids, the Pali term ''nīvaraṇa'' (Sanskrit: ''nivāraṇa'') refers to an obstacle or hindrance only in the ethical sense, and is usually enumerated in a set of five.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120629231520/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.2:1:669.pali Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 376], entry for "{{IAST|Nīvaraṇa}}."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ordinary fractal strings ==

An ''ordinary fractal string'' &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is a bounded, open subset of the real number line. Any such subset can be written as an at-most-[[countable set|countable]] union of connected [[open interval]]s with associated lengths &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}=\{\ell_1,\ell_2,\ldots\} &lt;/math&gt; written in non-increasing order. We allow &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; to consist of finitely many open intervals, in which case &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; consists of finitely many lengths. We refer to &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; as a ''fractal string''.

==Example==
The [[Cantor ternary set|middle third's Cantor set]] is constructed by removing the middle third from the unit interval &lt;math&gt; (0,1) &lt;/math&gt;, then removing the middle thirds of the subsequent intervals, ''ad infinitum''. The deleted intervals &lt;math&gt; \Omega=\left\{ \left(\frac 1 3, \frac 2 3 \right), \left( \frac 1 9, \frac 2 9 \right), \left( \frac 7 9, \frac 8 9 \right),\ldots\right\} &lt;/math&gt; have corresponding lengths &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}=\left\{ \frac 1 3, \frac 1 9, \frac 1 9,\ldots\right\} &lt;/math&gt;. Inductively, we can show that there are &lt;math&gt; 2^{n-1} &lt;/math&gt; intervals corresponding to each length of &lt;math&gt; 3^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we say that the ''multiplicity'' of the length &lt;math&gt; 3^{-n} &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; 2^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Heuristic==

The geometric information of the Cantor set in the example above is contained in the ordinary fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;. From this information we can compute the [[box-counting dimension]] of the Cantor set. This notion of [[fractal dimension]] can be generalized to that of [[complex dimension]], which will give us complete geometrical information regarding the local oscillations in the geometry of the Cantor set.

==The geometric zeta function==
If &lt;math&gt; \sum_{j \in \mathbb{J}} {\ell_j}&lt; \infty, &lt;/math&gt; we say that &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; has a geometric realization in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \Omega=\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty I_i &lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;I_i &lt;/math&gt; are intervals in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R} &lt;/math&gt;, of all the lengths &lt;math&gt; \{ \ell_j \}_{j \in \mathbb{J}} &lt;/math&gt;, taken with multiplicity.

For each fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;, we can associate to &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; a geometric zeta function &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathcal{L}} &lt;/math&gt; defined as the Dirichlet series &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathcal{L}} (s)=\sum_{j \in \mathbb{J}} \ell_j^{s} &lt;/math&gt;.  Poles of the geometric zeta function &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathcal{L}} (s) &lt;/math&gt; are called complex dimensions of the fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;. The general philosophy of the theory of complex dimensions for fractal strings is that complex dimensions describe the intrinsic oscillation in the geometry, spectra and dynamics of the fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;. 

The [[abscissa of convergence]] of &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathcal{L}}(s) &lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt; \sigma=\inf \left\{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} : \sum_{j=1}^\infty \ell_j^\alpha &lt; \infty \right\} &lt;/math&gt;.

For a fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt; with infinitely many nonzero lengths, the abscissa of convergence &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt; coincides with the [[Minkowski dimension]] of the boundary of the string, &lt;math&gt; \partial \Omega &lt;/math&gt;. For our example, the boundary Cantor string is the Cantor set itself. So the abscissa of convergence of the geometric zeta function &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathcal{L}}(s)  &lt;/math&gt; is the Minkowski dimension of the Cantor set, which is &lt;math&gt; \frac{\log 2}{\log 3} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Complex dimensions==

For a fractal string &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L} &lt;/math&gt;, composed of an infinite sequence of lengths, the ''complex dimensions'' of the fractal string are the poles of the analytic continuation of the geometric zeta function associated with the fractal string. (When the analytic continuation of a geometric zeta function is not defined to all of the complex plane, we take a subset of the complex plane called the "window", and look for the "visible" complex dimensions that exist within that window.&lt;ref name=one/&gt;)

==Example==

Continuing with the example of the fractal string associated to the middle thirds Cantor set, we compute &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathbb{C}}(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{2^{n-1}}{3^{ns}} =\frac{\frac{1}{3^s}}{1-\frac{2}{3^s}} &lt;/math&gt;. We compute the [[abscissa of convergence]] to be the value of &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt; 3^s=2 &lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt; s=\log_3 2=\frac{\log 2}{\log 3} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Minkowski dimension]] of the Cantor set.

For complex &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \zeta_{\mathbb{C}}(s) &lt;/math&gt; has [[pole (complex analysis)|poles]] at the infinitely many solutions of &lt;math&gt; 3^s=2 &lt;/math&gt;, which, for this example, occur at &lt;math&gt; s=\frac{\log 2 + 2 \pi i k}{\log 3} &lt;/math&gt;, for all integers &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;. This collection of points is called the set of complex dimensions of the middle thirds Cantor set.

==Applications==

For fractal strings associated with sets like Cantor sets, formed from deleted intervals that are [[rational number|rational]] powers of a fundamental length, the complex dimensions appear in a regular, arithmetic progression parallel to the imaginary axis, and are called ''lattice'' fractal strings. Sets that do not have this property are called ''non-lattice''. There is a dichotomy in the theory of measures of such objects: an ordinary fractal string is Minkowski measurable if and only if it is non-lattice.

In,&lt;ref name=one&gt;M. L. Lapidus, M. van Frankenhuijsen, [https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9781461421757 Fractal Geometry, Complex Dimensions and Zeta Functions: Geometry and Spectra of Fractal Strings], Monographs in Mathematics, Springer, New York, Second
revised and enlarged edition, 2012. {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4614-2176-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; the existence of non-real complex dimensions with positive real part are proposed to be the signature feature of fractal objects. Formally in,&lt;ref name=one/&gt; Michel Lapidus and Machiel van Frankenhuijsen propose to define “fractality” as the presence of at least one nonreal complex dimension with positive real part. This new definition of fractality solves some old problems in Fractal Geometry. For example, everyone can agree that the Cantor's Devil Staircase is fractal, which it is with this new definition of fractality in terms of complex dimensions, but it is not in the sense of Mandelbrot. 

A Spectral Reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis by Michel Lapidus and Helmut Maier

Following the examples of the a-string and of the ordinary Cantor string given by Michel Lapidus in the 1990s,
the notion of a fractal string was conceived and defined by Michel Lapidus and Carl Pomerance in their investigation of the one-dimensional Weyl-Berry conjecture for fractal drums and its connection  with the Riemann zeta function ~\cite{LapPo}.
The Riemann hypothesis turned out to be equivalent to the solvability of the corresponding inverse spectral problem for fractal strings, as was established by Michel Lapidus and Helmut Maier in ~\cite{LapMa}.
The heuristic notion of complex dimensions then started to emerge and was used in a crucial way in their spectral reformulation of the Riemann hypothesis.
The precise notion of complex dimensions, defined as the poles of the geometric zeta function associated with the fractal string, was crystallized and rigorously developed by Michel Lapidus and Machiel van Frankenhuijsen in the research monograph Fractal Geometry and Number Theory \cite{L-vF1} and then significantly further extended in the book
Fractal Geometry, Complex Dimensions and Zeta Functions ~\cite{L-vF2}.

The work of Michel Lapidus and Helmut Maier can be summarized as follows:

The inverse spectral problem for a fractal string can be solved if and only if its dimension is not 1/2.

The inverse spectral problem for a fractal string is not solvable in dimension 1/2 because the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)=1+1/2^s+1/3^s+\cdots$ 
vanishes (infinitely often) on the critical line $\Re(s)=1/2$. Therefore, the inverse spectral problem  is solvable in dimension $D\neq 1/2$ if and only if the Riemann zeta function does not vanish off the critical line $\Re(s)=1/2$ or, equivalently, if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true.

"'''Free Thought and Official Propaganda'''" is a speech (and subsequent publication) delivered in 1922 by [[Bertrand Russell]] on the importance of unrestricted freedom of expression in society, and the problem of the state and [[political class]] interfering in this through control of education, fines, economic leverage, and distortion of evidence.

==Freedom of speech==
Russell starts out by describing the more common use of the term "free thought" to mean that one does not accept unquestioning belief in the popular religion of a region, or ideally of any religion at all. But he goes on to say that a more important and global kind of free thought is the freedom of pressure to believe any specific ideas, that one be allowed to have and express any opinion without penalty.

He notes that this is not allowed in any country at all, with the possible exception of China at that time. One could not, for example, immigrate to the US without swearing they are not an [[anarchist]] or [[polygamous]], and once inside must not be [[communist]]. In [[Great Britain]] he must not express disbelief in [[Christianity]], in Japan of [[Shintoism]].

Russell notes that countries like these may think of themselves as having freedom of expression, but that some ideas are so obviously "monstrous and immoral" that such tolerance does not apply to them. But, he points out, this is exactly the same view that allowed torture during the [[Inquisition]], that all ideas must be allowed to be expressed, no matter how obviously bad.

Next, Russell describes incidents in his own life that illustrate the lack of freedom of thought. 

# One is that his father was a Free Thinker (agnostic or atheist), who arranged for three year old Bertrand to be raised as a free thinker when he was dying, but that the courts had overridden this and forced him to be raised Christian. 
# In 1910 Russell failed to receive [[Liberal Party]] nomination for Parliament when the party's inner circle had learned he was agnostic.[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/]
# When he became a lecturer at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], Russell was not allowed to become a [[Fellow]] (like having tenure) because the establishment of the college didn't want to add an "anti-clerical" vote to the college government. When Russell subsequently expressed opposition to [[World War I]], he was fired.

This repression by the political class, Russell notes, is not limited to religion. Believers in [[free love]] or communism are treated even worse.

==Will to doubt==
{{cquote|What we need is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out.&lt;ref&gt;[https://suebrewton.com/2015/05/31/william-wordsworth-vs-bertrand-russell/ William Wordsworth vs. Bertrand Russell]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Next, Bertrand Russell describes importance of the [[will to doubt]].&lt;ref name="will"/&gt; In 1896, American philosopher [[William James]] had written about the [[will to believe]], and Russell uses this as a foil to express his own opposite position. James claimed that even without (or with conflicting) evidence, one might still simply ''choose' to believe in a thing — he cites Christianity — simply because one thinks the belief has beneficial outcomes. 

Russell, along with [[Alfred Henry Lloyd]] and others, responds to this by describing the ''will to doubt'', the choice to remain [[skeptic]]al because it is the more logical, rational position that will lead to understanding more truth, while a "will to believe" will inevitably bind one into untruths in some way. "None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error. The methods of increasing the degree of truth 18 in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate."&lt;ref name="free"/&gt;

As an example of the benefits of this kind of actual skepticism, Russell describe's [[Albert Einstein]]'s overturning of the conventional wisdom of [[physics]] at that time, comparing it to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] contradicting [[Biblical literalists]] of the previous century. 

What, Bertrand asks, if instead of overturning physics, Einstein had proposed something equally new in the sphere of religion or politics?&lt;ref name="will"&gt;[https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/05/18/bertrand-russell-free-thought-propaganda-doubt/ The Will to Doubt: Bertrand Russell on Free Thought and Our Only Effective Self-Defense Against Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|English people would have found elements of Prussianism in his theory; anti-Semites would have regarded it as a Zionist plot; nationalists in all countries would have found it tainted with lily-livered pacifism, and proclaimed it a mere dodge for escaping military service. All the old-fashioned professors would have approached Scotland Yard to get the importation of his writings prohibited. Teachers favourable to him would have been dismissed. He, meantime, would have captured the Government of some backward country, where it would have 21 become illegal to teach anything except his doctrine, which would have grown into a mysterious dogma not understood by anybody. Ultimately the truth or falsehood of his doctrine would be decided on the battlefield, without the collection of any fresh evidence for or against it. '''This method is the logical outcome of William James’s will to believe.'''&lt;br/&gt;
What is wanted is not the will to believe, but the wish to find out, which is its exact opposite.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44932/44932-h/44932-h.htm Free Thought and Official Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Assuming that the need for rational doubt or [[fallibilism]] is understood to be important, Russell then goes on to address the question of why irrational certainty is so common. He says this is largely because of three factors.

* '''Education''' — Instead of public education being used to teach children healthy learning attitudes, they are used for the opposite, to indoctrinate children with dogma, often patently false, even known to be false by the officials imposing the education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/03/07/never-die/ I Would Never Die for My Beliefs Because I Might Be Wrong]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Propaganda''' — After being taught to read but not weigh evidence and form original opinions, children become adults who are then subjected to dubious or obviously false claims for the rest of their lives.
* '''Economic pressure''' — The State and political class will use its control of finances and economy to impose its ideas, by restricting the choices of those who disagree.

[[File:Gimbal 3 axes rotation.gif|thumb|Gimbal with 3 axes of rotation. A set of three gimbals mounted together to allow three degrees of freedom: roll, pitch and yaw. When two gimbals rotate around the same axis, the system loses one degree of freedom.]]
[[File:Gimbal lock still occurs with 4 axis.png|thumb|Adding a fourth rotational axis can solve the problem of gimbal lock, but it requires the outermost ring to be actively driven so that it stays 90 degrees out of alignment with the innermost axis (the flywheel shaft). Without active driving of the outermost ring, all four axes can become aligned in a plane as shown above, again leading to gimbal lock and inability to roll.]]

'''Gimbal lock''' is the loss of one [[degree of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] in a three-dimensional, three-[[gimbal]] mechanism that occurs when the axes of two of the three gimbals are driven into a parallel configuration, "locking" the system into [[rotation]] in a degenerate two-dimensional space.

The word ''lock'' is misleading: no gimbal is restrained. All three gimbals can still rotate freely about their respective axes of suspension. Nevertheless, because of the parallel orientation of two of the gimbals' axes there is no gimbal available to accommodate rotation about one axis.

==Gimbals==
{{Main|Gimbal}}

A gimbal is a ring that is suspended so it can rotate about an axis. Gimbals are typically nested one within another to accommodate rotation about multiple axes.

They appear in [[gyroscope]]s and in [[inertial measurement unit]]s to allow the inner gimbal's orientation to remain fixed while the outer gimbal suspension assumes any orientation. In [[compasses]] and [[flywheel energy storage]] mechanisms they allow objects to remain upright. They are used to orient [[Rocket engine|thrusters]] on rockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/gimbal.htm|title=What is a gimbal -- and what does it have to do with NASA?|author=Jonathan Strickland|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[coordinate system]]s in mathematics behave as if there were real gimbals used to measure the angles, notably [[Euler angles]].

For cases of three or fewer nested gimbals, gimbal lock inevitably occurs at some point in the system due to properties of [[covering space]]s (described below).

==In engineering==
While only two specific orientations produce exact gimbal lock, practical mechanical gimbals encounter difficulties near those orientations.  When a set of gimbals is close to the locked configuration, small rotations of the gimbal platform require large motions of the surrounding gimbals.  Although the ratio is infinite only at the point of gimbal lock, the practical speed and acceleration limits of the gimbals&amp;mdash;due to inertia (resulting from the mass of each gimbal ring), bearing friction, the flow resistance of air or other fluid surrounding the gimbals (if they are not in a vacuum), and other physical and engineering factors&amp;mdash;limit the motion of the platform close to that point.

===In two dimensions===
Gimbal lock can occur in gimbal systems with two degrees of freedom such as a [[theodolite]] with rotations about an [[azimuth]] and elevation in two dimensions. These systems can gimbal lock at [[zenith]] and [[nadir]], because at those points azimuth is not well-defined, and rotation in the azimuth direction does not change the direction the theodolite is pointing.

Consider tracking a helicopter flying towards the theodolite from the horizon. The theodolite is a telescope mounted on a tripod so that it can move in azimuth and elevation to track the helicopter. The helicopter flies towards the theodolite and is tracked by the telescope in elevation and azimuth. The helicopter flies immediately above the tripod (i.e. it is at zenith) when it changes direction and flies at 90 degrees to its previous course. The telescope cannot track this maneuver without a discontinuous jump in one or both of the gimbal orientations. There is no continuous motion that allows it to follow the target. It is in gimbal lock. So there is an infinity of directions around zenith for which the telescope cannot continuously track all movements of a target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/aug98/896993617.Eg.r.html |title= Re: What is meant by the term gimbal lock? |author= Adrian Popa |date= June 4, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that even if the helicopter does not pass through zenith, but only ''near'' zenith, so that gimbal lock does not occur, the system must still move exceptionally rapidly to track it, as it rapidly passes from one bearing to the other. The closer to zenith the nearest point is, the faster this must be done, and if it actually goes through zenith, the limit of these "increasingly rapid" movements becomes ''infinitely'' fast, namely discontinuous.

To recover from gimbal lock the user has to go around the zenith – explicitly: reduce the elevation, change the azimuth to match the azimuth of the target, then change the elevation to match the target.

Mathematically, this corresponds to the fact that [[spherical coordinates]] do not define a [[coordinate chart]] on the sphere at zenith and nadir. Alternatively, the corresponding map ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;rarr;''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; from the [[torus]] ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (given by the point with given azimuth and elevation) is not a [[covering map]] at these points.

===In three dimensions===
[[File:Gimbal lock airplane.gif|thumb|Gimbal locked airplane. When the pitch (green) and yaw (magenta) gimbals become aligned, changes to roll (blue) and yaw apply the same rotation to the airplane.]]
[[Image:no gimbal lock.png|thumb|Normal situation: the three gimbals are independent]]
[[Image:gimbal lock.png|thumb|Gimbal lock: two out of the three gimbals are in the same plane, one degree of freedom is lost]]

Consider a case of a level-sensing platform on an aircraft flying due north with its three gimbal axes mutually perpendicular (i.e., [[Roll (flight)|roll]], [[Pitch (aviation)|pitch]] and [[Yaw angle|yaw]] angles each zero). If the aircraft pitches up 90 degrees, the aircraft and platform's yaw axis gimbal becomes parallel to the roll axis gimbal, and changes about yaw can no longer be compensated for.

===Solutions===
This problem may be overcome by use of a fourth gimbal, intelligently driven by a motor so as to maintain a large angle between roll and yaw gimbal axes.  Another solution is to rotate one or more of the gimbals to an arbitrary position when gimbal lock is detected and thus reset the device.

Modern practice is to avoid the use of gimbals entirely. In the context of [[inertial navigation system]]s, that can be done by mounting the inertial sensors directly to the body of the vehicle (this is called a [[strapdown]] system)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~verp/projects/smartpen/node8.html#SECTION00322000000000000000|title=Overview of Pen Design and Navigation Background|author=Chris Verplaetse|year=1995|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214023126/http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~verp/projects/smartpen/node8.html#SECTION00322000000000000000|archivedate=2009-02-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and integrating sensed rotation and acceleration digitally using [[quaternion]] methods to derive vehicle orientation and velocity. Another way to replace gimbals is to use fluid bearings or a flotation chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?IA=US2005043537&amp;DISPLAY=DESC|title=Articulated gas bearing support pads|author=Chappell, Charles, D.|year=2006}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On Apollo 11===
A well-known gimbal lock incident happened in the [[Apollo 11]] Moon mission. On this spacecraft, a set of gimbals was used on an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU). The engineers were aware of the gimbal lock problem but had declined to use a fourth gimbal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/e-1344.htm|title=Apollo Guidance and Navigation - Considerations of Apollo IMU Gimbal Lock - MIT Instrumentation Laboratory Document E-1344|author=David Hoag|year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reasoning behind this decision is apparent from the following quote:

{{Quote|"The advantages of the redundant gimbal seem to be outweighed by the equipment simplicity, size advantages, and corresponding implied reliability of the direct three degree of freedom unit."|David Hoag|''Apollo Lunar Surface Journal''}}

They preferred an alternate solution using an indicator that would be triggered when near to 85 degrees pitch.

{{Quote|"Near that point, in a closed stabilization loop, the torque motors could theoretically be commanded to flip the gimbal 180 degrees instantaneously. Instead, in the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM]], the computer flashed a 'gimbal lock' warning at 70 degrees and froze the IMU at 85 degrees"|Paul Fjeld|''Apollo Lunar Surface Journal''}}

Rather than try to drive the gimbals faster than they could go, the system simply gave up and froze the platform. From this point, the spacecraft would have to be manually moved away from the gimbal lock position, and the platform would have to be manually realigned using the stars as a reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/gimbals.html|title=Gimbal Angles, Gimbal Lock, and a Fourth Gimbal for Christmas|author1=Eric M. Jones |author2=Paul Fjeld |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Lunar Module had landed, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Mike Collins]] aboard the Command Module joked "How about sending me a fourth gimbal for Christmas?"

===Robotics===
[[File:Automation of foundry with robot.jpg|thumb|right|Industrial robot operating in a foundry.]]
In robotics, gimbal lock is commonly referred to as "wrist flip", due to the use of a "triple-roll wrist" in [[robotic arm]]s, where three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point.

An example of a wrist flip, also called a wrist singularity, is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot's wrist to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the end effector, and the process.

The importance of avoiding singularities in robotics has led the American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements to define it as "a condition caused by the collinear alignment of two or more robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities".&lt;ref&gt;ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==In applied mathematics==
{{No footnotes|section|date=July 2013}}
The problem of gimbal lock appears when one uses [[Euler angles]] in applied mathematics; developers of 3D [[computer program]]s, such as [[3D modeling]], [[inertial guidance system|embedded navigation systems]], and [[video game]]s must take care to avoid it.

In formal language, gimbal lock occurs because the map from Euler angles to rotations (topologically, from the 3-torus ''T&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' to the [[real projective space]] '''RP'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; which is the same as the space of 3d rotations SO3) is not a [[covering map]] – it is not a [[local homeomorphism]] at every point, and thus at some points the [[Rank (differential topology)|rank]] (degrees of freedom) must drop below 3, at which point gimbal lock occurs. Euler angles provide a means for giving a numerical description of any [[rotation]] in three-dimensional space using three numbers, but not only is this description not unique, but there are some points where not every change in the target space (rotations) can be realized by a change in the source space (Euler angles). This is a topological constraint – there is no covering map from the 3-torus to the 3-dimensional real projective space; the only (non-trivial) covering map is from the 3-sphere, as in the use of [[quaternions]].

To make a comparison, all the [[translation (geometry)|translations]] can be described using three numbers &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, as the succession of three consecutive linear movements along three perpendicular axes &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; axes. The same holds true for rotations: all the rotations can be described using three numbers &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, as the succession of three rotational movements around three axes that are perpendicular one to the next. This similarity between linear coordinates and angular coordinates makes Euler angles very [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]], but unfortunately they suffer from the gimbal lock problem.

===Loss of a degree of freedom with Euler angles===
A rotation in 3D space can be represented numerically with [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in several ways. One of these representations is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
R &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos \alpha &amp; -\sin \alpha \\
0 &amp; \sin \alpha &amp; \cos \alpha \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \beta &amp; 0 &amp; \sin \beta \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
-\sin \beta &amp; 0 &amp; \cos \beta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \gamma &amp; -\sin \gamma &amp; 0 \\
\sin \gamma &amp; \cos \gamma &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example worth examining happens when &lt;math&gt;\beta = \tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Knowing that &lt;math&gt;\cos \tfrac{\pi}{2} = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin \tfrac{\pi}{2} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the above expression becomes equal to:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 R &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; \cos \alpha &amp; -\sin \alpha \\
0 &amp; \sin \alpha &amp; \cos \alpha \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \gamma &amp; -\sin \gamma &amp; 0 \\
\sin \gamma &amp; \cos \gamma &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Carrying out [[matrix multiplication]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 R &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\sin \alpha &amp; \cos \alpha &amp; 0 \\
-\cos \alpha &amp; \sin \alpha &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \gamma &amp; -\sin \gamma &amp; 0 \\
\sin \gamma &amp; \cos \gamma &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\sin \alpha \cos \gamma + \cos \alpha \sin \gamma &amp; -\sin \alpha \sin \gamma + \cos \alpha \cos \gamma &amp; 0 \\
-\cos \alpha \cos \gamma + \sin \alpha \sin \gamma &amp; \cos \alpha \sin \gamma + \sin \alpha \cos \gamma &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

And finally using the [[trigonometry formulas#Angle sum and difference identities|trigonometry formulas]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 R &amp;= \begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\sin ( \alpha + \gamma ) &amp; \cos (\alpha + \gamma) &amp; 0 \\
-\cos ( \alpha + \gamma ) &amp; \sin (\alpha + \gamma) &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Changing the values of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; in the above matrix has the same effects: the rotation angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \gamma&lt;/math&gt; changes, but the rotation axis remains in the &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; direction: the last column and the first row in the matrix won't change. The only solution for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; to recover different roles is to change &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

It is possible to imagine an airplane rotated by the above-mentioned Euler angles using the '''X-Y-Z''' convention. In this case, the first angle - &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the pitch. Yaw is then set to &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the final rotation - by &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; - is again the airplane's pitch. Because of gimbal lock, it has lost one of the degrees of freedom - in this case the ability to roll.

It is also possible to choose another convention for representing a rotation with a matrix using Euler angles than the '''X-Y-Z''' convention above, and also choose other variation intervals for the angles, but in the end there is always at least one value for which a degree of freedom is lost.

The gimbal lock problem does not make Euler angles "invalid" (they always serve as a well-defined coordinate system), but it makes them unsuited for some practical applications.

===Alternate orientation representation===
The cause of gimbal lock is representing an orientation as three axial rotations with [[Euler angles]]. A potential solution therefore is to represent the orientation in some other way. This could be as a [[rotation matrix]], a quaternion (see [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]), or a similar orientation representation that treats the orientation as a value rather than three separate and related values. Given such a representation, the user stores the orientation as a value. To apply angular changes, the orientation is modified by a delta angle/axis rotation. The resulting orientation must be re-normalized to prevent [[Floating point#Accuracy problems|floating-point error]] from successive transformations from accumulating. For matrices, re-normalizing the result requires converting the matrix into its [[orthonormal matrix#Nearest orthogonal matrix|nearest orthonormal representation]]. For quaternions, re-normalization requires [[unit quaternions|performing quaternion normalization]].

'''Saint Godelieve''' (also known as '''Godeleva, Godeliève, Godelina''') ({{lang-nl|Sint-Godelieve}}) ({{circa}} 1052{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=45}} – 6 July 1070) is a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] [[saint]].{{sfn|Harper-Bill|1999|p=157}}

==Hagiography==
Tradition, as recorded in her ''Vita'', states that she was pious as a young girl, and became much sought after by suitors as a beautiful young woman. Godelieve, however, wanted to become a [[nun]]. A nobleman named Bertolf (Berthold) of [[Gistel]], however, determined to marry her, successfully invoked the help of her father's overlord, [[Eustace II, Count of Boulogne]].{{sfn|Harper-Bill|1999|p=157}} Berthold's servants were ordered to provide only bread and water to the young bride.{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=45}}  Godelieve shared this food with the poor.{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=50}}

Godelieve managed to escape to the home of her father, Hemfrid, seigneur of [[Wierre-Effroy]].{{sfn|Harper-Bill|1999|p=157}}  Hemfrid, appealing to the [[Bishop of Tournai|Bishops of Tournai]] and [[Bishop of Soissons|Soissons]] and the [[Count of Flanders]], managed to have Bertolf restore Godelieve to her rightful position as his wife.

In July 1070, Godelieve returned to Gistel and soon after, at the order of Bertolf, was [[strangled]] by two servants and thrown into a pool,{{efn|Kienzle and Nienhuis state she was placed in her bed{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=45}}}}{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=45}} to make it appear as if she had died a [[natural death]].

==Legend==
According to legend, Bertolf married again, and had a daughter Edith, who was born [[blindness|blind]]: the legend  states that Edith was cured through the intercession of Saint Godelieve.{{sfn|Mulder-Bakker|2002|p=69}} Bertolf, now repentant of his crimes, went to [[Rome]] to obtain [[absolution]]. He went on a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]], and became a monk at St. Winnoc's Abbey at [[Bergues]].{{sfn|Mulder-Bakker|2002|p=69}} Edith founded a [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] at [[Gistel]], which was dedicated to Saint Godelieve, which she joined herself as a nun.{{sfn|Mulder-Bakker|2002|p=69}}

==Veneration==
Godelieve's body was [[exhumation|exhumed]] in 1084 by the Bishops of Tournai and [[Bishop of Noyon|Noyon]], in the presence of [[Gertrude of Saxony]], the wife of [[Robert I, Count of Flanders]], the Abbot of St. Winnoc's and a number of clergymen. It was Radbod II, bishop of Noyon-Tournai, that consecrated Godelieve's relics in 1084,{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=46}} and Godelieve's popular cult developed thereafter.{{sfn|Kienzle|Nienhuis|2001|p=45-46}}

Drogo, a monk of St. Winnoc's Abbey, wrote Godelieve's biography, the ''Vita Godeliph'', about ten years after her death.{{sfn|Head|2001|p=359}} The abbey of [[Ten Putte Abbey]] in Bruges was dedicated to her,{{sfn|de Vries|2007|p=44}} and the name of the first Abbess was Agatha.{{sfn|Mulder-Bakker|2002|p=69}}

Every year, on the Sunday following 5 July, a [[procession]] celebrating Saint Godelieve takes place in Gistel.

Godelieve's [[feast day]], 6 July, was, like that of [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]] in England and [[Medardus|Saint Medard]] in France, connected with the [[weather]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicculture.org/lit/activities/view.cfm?id=1133&lt;/ref&gt; She is thus considered one of the "weather saints."

==The Godelieve Polyptych==
Godelieve's life is represented in the Godelieve Polyptych, now in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/110001475&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">In [[mathematics]], the '''Hausdorff maximal principle''' is an alternate and earlier formulation of [[Zorn's lemma]] proved by [[Felix Hausdorff]] in 1914 (Moore 1982:168). It states that in any [[partial order|partially ordered set]], every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset.

The Hausdorff maximal principle is one of many statements equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] over ZF ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice). The principle is also called the '''Hausdorff maximality theorem''' or the '''Kuratowski lemma''' (Kelley 1955:33).

==Statement==

The Hausdorff maximal principle states that, in any [[partial order|partially ordered set]], every [[total order|totally ordered]] [[subset]] is contained in a maximal totally ordered subset. Here a maximal totally ordered subset is one that, if enlarged in any way, does not remain totally ordered. The maximal set produced by the principle is not unique, in general; there may be many maximal totally ordered subsets containing a given totally ordered subset.

An equivalent form of the principle is that in every partially ordered set there exists a maximal totally ordered subset.

To prove that it follows from the original form, let ''A'' be a [[poset]]. Then &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a totally ordered subset of ''A'', hence there exists a maximal totally ordered subset containing &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;, in particular ''A'' contains a maximal totally ordered subset.

For the converse direction, let ''A'' be a partially ordered set and ''T'' a totally ordered subset of ''A''. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\{S\mid T\subseteq S\subseteq A\mbox{ and S totally ordered}\}&lt;/math&gt;
is partially ordered by set inclusion &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt;, therefore it contains a maximal totally ordered subset ''P''. Then the set &lt;math&gt;M=\bigcup P&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the desired properties.

The proof that the Hausdorff maximal principle is equivalent to Zorn's lemma is very similar to this proof.

== Examples ==
'''EXAMPLE 1.'''    If ''A'' is any collection of sets, the relation "is a proper subset of" is a [[strict partial order]] on ''A''. Suppose that ''A'' is the collection of all circular regions (interiors of circles) in the plane. One maximal totally ordered sub-collection of ''A'' consists of all circular regions with centers at the origin. Another maximal totally ordered sub-collection consists of all circular regions bounded by circles tangent from the right to the y-axis at the origin.

'''EXAMPLE 2.''' If (x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) are two points of the plane ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, define (x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) &lt; (x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)

if y&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is a partial ordering of ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; under which two points are comparable only if they lie on the same horizontal line. The maximal totally ordered sets are horizontal lines in ℝ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23453">The [[fair trade]] movement has undergone several important changes since its early days following [[World War II]]. Fair trade, first seen as a form of charity advocated by religious organizations, has radically changed in structure, philosophy and approach. The past fifty years have witnessed massive changes in the diversity of fair trade proponents, the products traded and their distribution networks.

==The origins of fair trade==

Fair trade principles have deep roots in European societies long before the first structured [[alternative trading organization]]s (ATOs) emerged following World War II. Many of the fundamental concepts behind fair trade actually show a great resemblance with pre-capitalist ideas about the organization of the economy and society.

The notion of the ‘old moral economy’ is a fitting example of such conceptions. [[E. P. Thompson]], in his  work on 18th century England, described a society where "notions of common well being, often supported by paternalistic traditional authorities, imposed some limits on the free operations of the market".&lt;ref name="Fridell, Gavin 2003"&gt;Fridell, Gavin (2003). ''Fair Trade and the International Moral Economy: Within and Against the Market.'' CERLAC Working Paper Series.&lt;/ref&gt; Farmers were then not allowed to manipulate prices by withholding their products to wait for price increases. The actions of the middlemen were always considered legally suspect, were severely restricted and the poor were provided opportunities to buy staple foods in small parcels. Fair trade was already seen as a way to address market failures; although the concept mainly revolved around consumer, rather than producer, rights.&lt;ref name="Fridell, Gavin 2003"/&gt;

In 1827 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], a moral and economic [[boycott]] of slave-derived goods began with the formation of the "Free Produce Society", founded by [[Thomas M'Clintock]] and other [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers). In the [[Free produce movement]], they sought to fight against slavery with a new tactic, one that emphasized the value of the honest labor of free men and women, and to try to determine the unseen added costs to goods such as cotton and sugar which came from the toil of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard S. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxN8GXEKspQC&amp;pg=PA266 ''Freedom's Prophet: Bishop Richard Allen, the AME Church, and the Black Founding Fathers''], NYU Press, 2008, p. 266. {{ISBN|0-8147-5826-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830, African Americans formed the "Colored Free Produce Society", and women formed their own branch in 1831. In 1838, supporters from a number of states came together in the American Free Produce Association, which promoted their cause by seeking non-slave alternates to products from slaveholders, forming non-slave distribution channels, and publishing a number of pamphlets, tracts, and the journal ''Non-Slaveholder''. The movement did not grow large enough to gain the benefit of the [[Economy of scale|economies of scale]], and the cost of "free produce" was always higher than competing goods. The national association disbanded in 1847, but Quakers in Philadelphia continued until 1856.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, Peter and McKivigan, John, editors. Williams, R. Owen, assistant editor. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_SeZrcBqt-YC&amp;pg=PA267 ''Encyclopedia of antislavery and abolition''], Greenwood Press, 2007, pp. 267–268. {{ISBN|0-313-33142-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Havelaar 9e druk.jpg|right|thumb|Front cover of ''Max Havelaar'', 9th edition (1891).]]
There have been a few instances in which fair trade in the 'old moral economy' was focused on producer rights: as early as 1859, Dutch author [[Multatuli]] (the pen name of Eduard Douwes Dekker) questioned the injustice of the colonial and capitalist system towards commodity producers in his novel ''[[Max Havelaar]]''. The fictional tale recounts the story of Max Havelaar, a Nederlandse Trade Company employee, who leaves everything to work in solidarity with local Indonesian workers. This account draws a direct correlation between the wealth and the prosperity of Europe and the poverty of the suffering of other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P.

==Early fair trade initiatives==

In 1897 [[The Salvation Army]] launched the [[Hamodava]] Tea Company. Hamodava pioneered a fair trade model which sought to pay fair prices to the tea farmers, whilst also offering a scheme by which they could purchase plantation land on a co-operative giving them financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.salvationarmy.org.nz/our-community/faith-in-life/our-people-our-stories/the-social-cup|title=The social cup|website=www.salvationarmy.org.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The fair trade movement was shaped in the years following [[World War II]]. Early attempts to commercialize in Northern markets goods produced by marginalised producers were initiated by religious groups and various politically oriented [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGOs).

The [[Mennonite Central Committee]] (MCC) and [[SERRV International]] were the first, in 1946 and 1949 respectively, to develop fair trade supply chains in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history3.shtml Crafts and Food]. Accessed August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The products, almost exclusively [[handicrafts]] ranging from [[jute]] goods to [[cross-stitch]] work, were mostly sold by volunteers in 'charity stores' or 'ethnic shops'. The goods themselves had often no other function than to indicate that a donation had been made.&lt;ref&gt;Hockerts, K. (2005). [http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf The Fair Trade Story] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823071706/http://www.oikos-foundation.unisg.ch/homepage/fairtrade.pdf |date=2006-08-23 }}. p1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solidarity trade==
[[File:Fair Trade Products.jpg|thumb|left|Fair Trade goods sold in Worldshops]]
The modern fair trade movement was shaped in Europe in the 1960s. Fair trade during that period was often seen as a political gesture against [[neo-imperialism]]: radical student movements began targeting multinational corporations and concerns that traditional business models were fundamentally flawed started to emerge. The global free market economic model came under attack during that period and fair trade ideals, built on a [[Post Keynesian economics]] approach to economies where price is directly linked to the actual production costs and where all producers are given fair and equal access to the markets, gained in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p4&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan at the time, "Trade not Aid", gained international recognition in 1968 when it was adopted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to put the emphasis on the establishment of fair trade relations with the [[developing world]].&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history2.shtml Where did it all begin?] URL accessed on August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 the first ATO was created: British NGO [[Oxfam]] launched "[[Helping-by-Selling]]", a program which later developed into [[Bridge (program)|Bridge]]. The scheme sold imported handicrafts in Oxfam stores in the [[United Kingdom]] and from mail-order catalogues with a circulation of almost 100,000 copies. The program was created to support the work of [[cooperative]]s and community enterprises in the developing world. The program was highly successful: it remained one of the largest and most influential in the sector and then changed in 2002 as more mainstream retailers were persuaded to carry fair trade products. Globally Oxfam still works in many countries on fair trade programs and runs hundreds of shops across Europe and Australia selling and promoting fair trade goods.

In 1969, the first Worldshop opened its doors in the Netherlands. The initiative aimed at bringing the principles of fair trade to the retail sector by selling almost exclusively goods such as handcrafts produced under fair trade terms in "underdeveloped regions". The first shop was run by volunteers and was so successful that dozens of similar shops soon went into business in the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Germany]] and in other Western European countries.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, important segments of the fair trade movement worked to find markets for products from countries that were excluded from the mainstream trading channels for political reasons. Thousands of volunteers sold coffee from [[Angola]] and [[Nicaragua]] in Worldshops, in the back of churches, from their homes and from stands in public places, using the products as a vehicle to deliver their message: give disadvantaged producers in developing countries a fair chance on the world’s market, and you support their self-determined sustainable development. The alternative trade movement blossomed, if not in sales, then at least in terms of dozens of ATOs being established on both sides of the Atlantic, of scores of Worldshops being set up, and of well-organized actions and campaigns attacking exploitation and foreign domination, and promoting the ideals of [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Julius Nyerere]] and the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]]: the right to independence and self-determination, to equitable access to the world’s markets and consumers.

==Handcrafts vs. agricultural goods==
In the early 1980s, Alternative Trading Organizations faced a major challenge: the novelty of some fair trade products started wearing off, demand reached a plateau and some handicrafts began to look "tired and old fashioned" in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Redfern A. 2002 p6"&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p6&lt;/ref&gt; The decline of segments of the handicrafts market forced fair trade supporters to rethink their business model and their goals. Moreover, fair trade supporters during this period became increasingly worried by the impact of the fall of agricultural [[commodity]] prices on poor producers. Many then believed it was the movement's responsibility to address the issue and to find innovative remedies to address the ongoing crisis in the industry.

In the subsequent years, fair trade agricultural commodities played an important role in the growth of many ATOs: successful on the market, they offered a renewable source of income for producers and provided Alternative Trading Organizations the perfect substitute to the stagnating handicrafts market. The collapse of the [[International Coffee Agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/25/business/coffee-price-talks-foreseen.html |title=Coffee Price Talks Foreseen - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-11-25 |accessdate=2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989 fueled the extraordinary growth of the [[fair trade coffee]] market, providing a powerful narrative for a new breed of fair trade brand that engaged producers directly in consumer operations. Cafédirect is a good example of this new thinking and was the first fair trade brand to be found in UK supermarkets. Dedicated to the mainstream, Cafédirect created focused on consumer engagement and language and built a reputation for quality, justifying its premium positioning with the tag-line "We pay more, so you get the pick of the crop".

The first fair trade agricultural products were [[coffee]] and [[tea]], quickly followed by dried [[fruits]], cocoa, sugar, [[fruit juices]], [[rice]], [[spices]] and [[nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Coffee quickly became the main growth engine behind fair trade: between 25 and 50% of the total alternative trading organization turnover in 2005 came from coffee sales.&lt;ref&gt;International Fair Trade Association. (2005). [http://www.ifat.org/fthistory/history4.shtml Market Access and Fair Trade Labeling]. URL accessed on August 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm in 1992, in 2002 handcrafts accounted for 25.4% of sales while commodity food lines were up at 69.4%.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, A. &amp; Opal, C. (2004). Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition to agricultural commodities was further highlighted in 2002, when Oxfam decided to abandon its loss-making handcrafts trading program after 27 years of existence. Oxfam’s move had significant consequences on the entire fair trade movement. Some ATOs saw this as an opportunity to restructure and partner up with mainstream businesses in an effort to find economic efficiencies and broaden their appeal, while others (such as Alternativ Handel in [[Norway]]), unable to adjust to the market and plagued by financial difficulties, were forced to close.

Today, many ATOs still exclusively sell handcrafts - which they judge culturally and economically preferable to agricultural commodities. While these are still considered fair trade flagship products, academics have described them as a [[niche market]] that now only appeals to relatively small segments of the population, mostly fair trade core supporters who buy products on the basis of the story behind the product.&lt;ref name="Redfern A. 2002 p6"/&gt;

==Rise of labelling initiatives==
''Note: Customary spelling of Fairtrade is one word when referring to product labelling''
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Oldftlogos2.jpg|thumb|Early Fairtrade Certifications Marks]] --&gt;&lt;!-- FAIR USE of Oldftlogos2.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Oldftlogos2.jpg for rationale --&gt;Sales of fair trade products however only really took off with the arrival of the first [[Fairtrade labelling]] initiatives. Although buoyed by ever growing sales, fair trade had been generally contained to relatively small Worldshops scattered across Europe and to a lesser extent, [[North America]]. Some felt that these shops were too disconnected from the rhythm and the lifestyle of contemporary developed societies. The inconvenience of going to them to buy only a product or two was too high even for the most dedicated customers. The only way to increase sale opportunities was to start offering fair trade products where consumers normally shop, in large distribution channels.&lt;ref&gt;Renard, M.-C., (2003). Fair Trade: quality, market and conventions. Journal of Rural Studies, 19, 87-96.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was to find a way to expand distribution without compromising consumer trust in fair trade products and in their origins.

A solution was found in 1988, when the first Fairtrade label, Max Havelaar, was launched under the initiative of [[Nico Roozen]], [[Frans van der Hoff]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[ecumenical]] [[development agency]] [[Solidaridad]]. The independent certification allowed the goods to be sold outside the [[worldshops]] and into the mainstream, reaching a larger consumer segment and boosting fair trade sales significantly. The [[Fairtrade labelling|labeling initiative]] also allowed customers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the producers at the end of the [[supply chain]].&lt;ref&gt;Redfern A. &amp; Snedker P. (2002) [http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf Creating Market Opportunities for Small Enterprises: Experiences of the Fair Trade Movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209015558/http://www.ilo.org/dyn/empent/docs/F1057768373/WP30-2002.pdf |date=2006-12-09 }}. International Labor Office. p7&lt;/ref&gt;

On the producer end, the Max Havelaar initiative offered disadvantaged producers following various social and environmental standards a fair price, significantly above the market price, for their crop. The coffee, originating from the [[UCIRI]] cooperative in Mexico, was imported by Dutch company [[Van Weely]], roasted by [[Neuteboom]], sold directly to [[world shops]] and, for the first time, to mainstream retailers across the [[Netherlands]].

The initiative was groundbreaking as for the first time Fairtrade coffee was sold in supermarkets and mass-retailers, therefore reaching a larger consumer segment. Fairtrade labelling also allowed consumers and distributors alike to track the origin of the goods to confirm that the products were really benefiting the farmers at the end of the [[supply chain]].
The initiative was a great success and was replicated in several other markets: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called "Max Havelaar" (in [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[France]]), "Transfair" (in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Italy]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]]), or carrying a national name: "Fairtrade  Mark" in the UK and [[Ireland]], "Rättvisemärkt" in [[Sweden]], and "Reilu Kauppa" in [[Finland]].

|}Initially, the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs each had their own Fairtrade standards, product committees and monitoring systems. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations – or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives") – started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]] (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, FLO launched a new [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross border trade and simplify export procedures for both producers and exporters.

The Fairtrade Certification Mark harmonization process is still under way – today, all but two labelling initiatives ([[Transfair USA]] &amp; [[TransFair Canada]]) have adopted the new International Fairtrade Certification Mark. Full transition to the new Fairtrade Mark should become reality as it gradually replaces the old certification marks at various speeds in various countries.

In January 2004, FLO was divided into two independent organizations: [[FLO International]], which sets Fairtrade standards and provides producer business support, and [[FLO-CERT]], which inspects and certifies producer organizations. The aim of the split was to ensure the impartiality, the independence of the certification process and compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 65 standards for product certification bodies.

At present, over 20 Labelling Initiatives are members of FLO International. There are now Fairtrade Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO’s certification for [[coffee]], [[tea]], [[rice]], [[banana]]s, [[mangoes]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit juices]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herbs]] and [[spices]], [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs]] etc.

== WFTO and the FTO Mark ==
In an effort to complement the Fairtrade certification system and allow for example handcraft producers to also sell their products outside [[worldshops]], the [[World Fair Trade Organization]] (WFTO), formerly the International Fair Trade Association (founded 1989), launched a new Mark to identify fair trade organizations in 2004 (as opposed to products in the case of Fairtrade). Called the FTO Mark, it allows consumers to recognize registered Fair Trade Organizations worldwide and guarantees that standards are being implemented regarding working conditions, wages, child labour and the environment.

The FTO Mark gave for the first time Fair Trade Organizations (including [[handcrafts]] producers) definable recognition amongst consumers, existing and new business partners, governments and donors.

==Fair trade today==
Global fair trade sales have soared over the past decade. The increase has been particularly spectacular among Fairtrade labelled goods:  In 2007, [[Fairtrade certification|Fair trade certified]] sales amounted to approximately €2.3 billion (US $3.62 billion) worldwide, a 47% year-to-year increase.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International (2008). http://www.fairtrade.net/single_view.html?&amp;cHash=d6f2e27d2c&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=104&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=41.

The '''idea–expression divide''' or '''idea–expression dichotomy''' limits the scope of [[copyright]] protection by differentiating an [[idea]] from the expression or manifestation of that idea.

The [[Computer Programs Directive|European Union Software Directive]], Article 1.2, for example, expressly excludes from copyright ideas and principles that underlie any element of a computer program, including those that underlie its interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Cite web|author=Mylly, Ulla=Maija|title=Harmonizing Copyright Rules for Computer Program Interface Protection|publisher=University of Louisville Louis D. Brandeis School of Law|location=Louisville, Kentucky|page=14|url=http://www.law.louisville.edu/sites/www.law.louisville.edu/files/cicl2-mylly.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605051113/http://www.law.louisville.edu/sites/www.law.louisville.edu/files/cicl2-mylly.pdf|archivedate=5 June 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Directive 2009/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the legal protection of computer programs|publisher=Official Journal of the European Union|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:111:0016:0022:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by the European Court of Justice in [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1446134154470&amp;uri=CELEX:62010CJ0406 SAS Institute Inc. v World Programming Ltd.], "to accept that the functionality of a computer program can be protected by copyright would amount to making it possible to monopolise ideas, to the detriment of technological progress and industrial development."

In the United States the 1879 opinion of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in the case of ''[[Baker v. Selden]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|101|99|1879}}&lt;/ref&gt; elaborated this doctrine, holding that, while exclusive rights to the "[[useful arts]]" (in this case [[bookkeeping]]) described in a book might be available by patent, only the description itself was protectable by copyright. In ''[[Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enters.]]'', 471 U.S. 539, 556 (1985), the Supreme Court stated that "copyright's idea/expression dichotomy 'strike[s] a definitional balance between the First Amendment and the Copyright Act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author's expression.'" (internal citation omitted). Additionally, in ''[[Mazer v. Stein]]'', 347 U.S. 201, 217 (1954), the Supreme Court stated "Unlike a patent, a copyright gives no exclusive right to the art disclosed; protection is given only to the expression of the idea—not the idea itself."

Some of the [[criticism of intellectual property|criticism directed at "intellectual property"]] is based on the confusion between [[patent]]s, which may confer [[Property|proprietary]] rights in relation to general ideas and concepts ''per se'' when construed as methods, and copyrights, which cannot confer such rights.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}
An [[adventure novel]] provides an illustration of the concept. Copyright may subsist in the work as a whole, in the particular story or characters involved, or in any [[art]]work contained in the book, but generally not in the idea or [[genre]] of the story. Copyright, therefore, may not subsist in the idea of a man venturing out on a [[quest]], but may subsist in a particular story that follows that pattern. Similarly, if the methods or processes described in a work are [[patentability|patentable]], they may be the subject of various [[claim (patent)|patent claims]], which may or may not be broad enough to cover other methods or processes based on the same idea. [[Arthur C. Clarke]], for example, sufficiently described the concept of a communications satellite (a [[geostationary satellite]] used as a [[telecommunications]] relay) in a 1945 paper that it was not considered patentable in 1954 when it was developed (independently{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}) at [[Bell Labs]].

In the English decision of ''[[Donoghue v. Allied Newspapers Limited]]'' (1938) Ch 106, the court illustrated the concept by stating that "the person who has clothed the idea in form, whether by means of a picture, a play or a book" owns the copyright. In the Australian decision of ''[[Victoria Park Racing and Recreation Grounds Co. Ltd v. Taylor]]'' (1937) 58 CLR 479 at 498, Latham CJ used the analogy of reporting a person's fall from a bus: the first person to do so could not use the law of copyright to stop other people from announcing this fact.

==Scènes à faire==
Some courts have recognized that particular ideas can be expressed effectively only by using certain elements or background. The [[French language|French]] name for this doctrine is ''[[Scènes à faire]]''. Therefore, even the expression in these circumstances is unprotected, or extremely limited to verbatim copying only. This is true in the United Kingdom and most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Lai, Stanley|year=1999|chapter=Chapter V: The Position of ''Scenes a Faire'' in English Law|title=The Copyright Protection of Computer Software in the United Kingdom|location=Oxford, England|publisher=Hart Publishing|pages=54–56|isbn=978-1-84113-087-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]] it is recognized that certain background elements are universal or at least commonplace in some types of work. For example, in ''Walker v. Time Life Films, Inc.'', 784 F.2d 44 (2d Cir. 1986), the [[Second Circuit]] said that in a film about cops in the South Bronx it was inevitable that the scenery would include drunks, stripped cars, prostitutes, and rats. In ''Gates Rubber Co. v. Bando Chemical Industries, Ltd.'', 9 F.3d 823 (10th Cir. 1993), the Tenth Circuit held that hardware standards and mechanical specifications, software standards and compatibility requirements, computer manufacturer design standards, target industry practices and demands, and computer industry programming practices were unprotectable scenes a faire for computer programs. The principle must have a limit, however, so that something is outside the ''scènes à faire'' doctrine for South Bronx movies. Perhaps, cockroaches, gangs, and muggings are also part of the South Bronx ''scène à faire'', but further similarity such as the film having as characters "a slumlord with a heart of gold and a policeman who is a Zen Buddhist and lives in a garage surely goes beyond the South Bronx ''scène à faire''. There must be some expression possible even in a cliche-ridden genre."

==Merger==
A broader but related concept is the merger doctrine. Some ideas can be expressed intelligibly only in one or a limited number of ways. The rules of a game provide an example.&lt;ref&gt;''Morrissey v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.'', 379 F.2d 675 (1st Cir. 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases the expression merges with the idea and is therefore not protected.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc.'', 862 F.2d 204 (9th Cir. 1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States federal courts|United States courts]] are divided on whether merger constitutes a defense to infringement or prevents copyrightability in the first place,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google, Inc., 750 F.3d 1339, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2014)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15197092051369647665&amp;q=oracle+v.+google&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is often pleaded as an [[affirmative defense]] to [[copyright infringement]].

In contemporary [[cognitive linguistics]], an image schema is considered an embodied prelinguistic structure of experience that motivates [[conceptual metaphor]] mappings. Evidence for image schemas (also called ''image schemata'') is drawn from a number of related disciplines, including work on cross-modal cognition in [[psychology]], from spatial cognition in both [[linguistics]] and psychology,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Johnson: From image schemas to abstract reasoning via metaphor==
[[Image:OutSchemas.png|175px|thumb|''Figure 2'' - Containment Image Schema (as applied to the English word ''out'')]]

Image schemas are dynamic embodied patterns—they take place ''in'' and ''through'' time. Moreover, they are multi-modal patterns of experience, not simply visual. For instance, consider how the dynamic nature of the containment schema is reflected in the various spatial senses of the English word ''out''. ''Out'' may be used in cases where a clearly defined trajector (TR) leaves a spatially bounded landmark (LM), as in:
:(1a) John went out of the room.
:(1b) Mary got out of the car.
:(1c) Spot jumped out of the pen.

In the most prototypical of such cases the landmark is a clearly defined container. However, ''out'' may also be used to indicate those cases where the trajector is a mass that spreads out, effectively expanding the area of the containing landmark:
:(2a) She poured out the beans.
:(2b) Roll out the carpet.
:(2c) Send out the troops.

Finally, ''out'' is also often used to describe motion along a linear path where the containing landmark is implied and not defined at all:
:(3) The train started out for Chicago.

Experientially basic and primarily spatial image schemas such as the Containment schema and its derivatives the Out schemas lend their logic to non-spatial situations. For example, one may metaphorically use the term ''out'' to describe non-spatial experiences:
:(4) Leave out that big log when you stack the firewood. (Schema used directly and non-metaphorically.)
:(4a) I don't want to leave any relevant data out of my argument. (Schema metaphorically projected onto argumentation.)
:(4b) Tell me your story again, and don't leave out any details. (Schema metaphorically projected onto story-telling.)
:(4c) She finally came out of her depression. (Schema metaphorically projected onto emotional life.)

Johnson argues that more abstract reasoning is shaped by such underlying spatial patterns. For example, he notes that the logic of containment is not just a matter of being in or out of the container. For example, if someone is in a ''deep'' depression, we know it is likely to be a long time before they are well. The deeper the trajector is in the container, the longer it will take for the trajector to get out of it. Similarly, Johnson argues that transitivity and the law of the excluded middle in logic are underlaid by preconceptual embodied experiences of the Containment schema.

==Lakoff: Image schemas in Brugman's ''The story of Over''==
In case study two of his book ''Women, Fire and Dangerous Things'', Lakoff re-presented the analysis of the English word ''over'' done by [[Claudia Brugman]] in her (1981) master's thesis. Similar to the analysis of ''out'' given by Johnson, Lakoff argued that there were six basic spatial schemas for the English word ''over''. Moreover, Lakoff gave a detailed accounting of how these schemas were interrelated in terms of what he called a ''radial category structure''. For example, these six schemas could be both further specified by other spatial schemas such as whether the trajector was in contact with the landmark or not (as in ''the plane flew over the mountain'' vs. ''he climbed over the mountain''). Furthermore, Lakoff identified a group of "transformational" image schemata such as rotational schemas and path to object mass, as in ''Spider-Man climbed all over the wall''. This analysis raised profound questions about how image schemas could be grouped, transformed, and how sequences of image schemas could be chained together in language, mind and brain.

==Relationships to similar theories==
Johnson indicates that his analysis of ''out'' drew upon a 1981 doctoral dissertation by [[Susan Lindner]] in linguistics at UCSD under [[Ronald Langacker]], and more generally by the theory of [[cognitive grammar]] put forth by him.&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite book |last=Langacker |first=Ronald W. |authorlink=Ronald Langacker |date=1987 |title=Foundations of Cognitive Grammar: Theoretical Prerequisites |location=Stanford, Calif. |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=0804712611 |oclc=37499775}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the force group of image schemas Johnson also drew on an early version of the [[Force Dynamics|force dynamic]] schemas put forth by [[Len Talmy]], as used by linguists such as [[Eve Sweetser]]. Other influences include [[Max Wertheimer]]'s [[Gestalt psychology|gestalt]] structure theory and [[Schema (Kant)|Kant's account of schemas]] in categorization, as well as studies in experimental psychology on the [[mental rotation]] of images.

In addition to the dissertation on ''over'' by Brugman, Lakoff's use of image schema theory also drew extensively on Talmy and Langacker's theories of spatial relations terms as well.

==Lists of image schemas==
While Johnson provided an initial list of image schemas in ''The Body in the Mind'' (p.&amp;nbsp;126), his diagrams for them are scattered throughout his book and he only diagrammed a portion of those image schemas he listed. In his work, Lakoff also used several additional schemas.

An '''influence diagram''' ('''ID''') (also called a '''relevance diagram''', '''decision diagram''' or a '''decision network''') is a compact graphical and mathematical representation of a decision situation.  It is a generalization of a [[Bayesian network]], in which not only [[bayesian inference|probabilistic inference]] problems but also [[decision making]] problems (following the [[expected utility|maximum expected utility]] criterion) can be modeled and solved.

ID was first developed in the mid-1970s by [[decision analysis|decision analysts]] with an intuitive semantic that is easy to understand. It is now adopted widely and becoming an alternative to the [[decision tree]] which typically suffers from [[exponential growth]] in number of branches with each variable modeled.  ID is directly applicable in [[team theory|team decision analysis]], since it allows incomplete sharing of information among team members to be modeled and solved explicitly.  Extensions of ID also find their use in [[game theory]] as an alternative representation of the [[game tree]].

==Semantics==

An ID is a [[directed acyclic graph]] with three types (plus one subtype) of [[graph node|node]] and three types of [[graph arc|arc]] (or arrow) between nodes.

Nodes:
:*''[[Decision making|Decision]] node'' (corresponding to each decision to be made) is drawn as a rectangle.
:*''[[Uncertainty]] node'' (corresponding to each uncertainty to be modeled) is drawn as an oval.
::*''Deterministic node'' (corresponding to special kind of uncertainty that its outcome is deterministically known whenever the outcome of some other uncertainties are also known) is drawn as a double oval.
:*''Value node'' (corresponding to each component of additively separable [[Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility]] function) is drawn as an octagon (or diamond).

Arcs:
:*''Functional arcs'' (ending in value node) indicate that one of the components of additively separable utility function is a function of all the nodes at their tails.
:*''Conditional arcs'' (ending in uncertainty node) indicate that the uncertainty at their heads is [[conditional probability|probabilistically conditioned]] on all the nodes at their tails.
::*''Conditional arcs'' (ending in deterministic node) indicate that the uncertainty at their heads is deterministically conditioned on all the nodes at their tails.
:*''Informational arcs'' (ending in decision node) indicate that the decision at their heads is made with the outcome of all the nodes at their tails known beforehand.

Given a properly structured ID:
:*Decision nodes and incoming information arcs collectively state the ''alternatives'' (what can be done when the outcome of certain decisions and/or uncertainties are known beforehand)
:*Uncertainty/deterministic nodes and incoming conditional arcs collectively model the ''information'' (what are known and their probabilistic/deterministic relationships)
:*Value nodes and incoming functional arcs collectively quantify the ''preference'' (how things are preferred over one another).

''Alternative, information, and preference'' are termed ''decision basis'' in decision analysis, they represent three required components of any valid decision situation.

Formally, the semantic of influence diagram is based on sequential construction of nodes and arcs, which implies a specification of all conditional independencies in the diagram.  The specification is defined by the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-separation criterion of Bayesian network.  According to this semantic, every node is probabilistically 
independent on its non-successor nodes given the outcome of its immediate predecessor nodes.  Likewise, a missing arc between non-value node &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and non-value node &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; implies that there exists a set of non-value nodes &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, e.g., the parents of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, that renders &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; independent of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; given the outcome of the nodes in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==

[[File:Simple Influence Diagram.svg|thumb|Simple influence diagram for making decision about vacation activity]]

Consider the simple influence diagram representing a situation where a decision-maker is planning their vacation.
:*There is 1 decision node (''Vacation Activity''), 2 uncertainty nodes (''Weather Condition, Weather Forecast''), and 1 value node (''Satisfaction'').
:*There are 2 functional arcs (ending in ''Satisfaction''), 1 conditional arc (ending in ''Weather Forecast''), and 1 informational arc (ending in ''Vacation Activity'').

:*Functional arcs ending in ''Satisfaction'' indicate that ''Satisfaction'' is a utility function of ''Weather Condition'' and ''Vacation Activity''.  In other words, their satisfaction can be quantified if they know what the weather is like and what their choice of activity is.  (Note that they do not value ''Weather Forecast'' directly)
:*Conditional arc ending in ''Weather Forecast'' indicates their belief that ''Weather Forecast'' and ''Weather Condition'' can be dependent.
:*Informational arc ending in ''Vacation Activity'' indicates that they will only know ''Weather Forecast'', not ''Weather Condition'', when making their choice.  In other words, actual weather will be known after they make their choice, and only forecast is what they can count on at this stage.

:*It also follows semantically, for example, that ''Vacation Activity'' is independent on (irrelevant to) ''Weather Condition'' given ''Weather Forecast'' is known.

==Applicability to value of information==

The above example highlights the power of the influence diagram in representing an extremely important concept in decision analysis known as the [[value of information]].  Consider the following three scenarios;
:*Scenario 1: The decision-maker could make their ''Vacation Activity'' decision while knowing what ''Weather Condition'' will be like.  This corresponds to adding extra informational arc from ''Weather Condition'' to ''Vacation Activity'' in the above influence diagram.
:*Scenario 2: The original influence diagram as shown above.
:*Scenario 3: The decision-maker makes their decision without even knowing the ''Weather Forecast''.  This corresponds to removing informational arc from ''Weather Forecast'' to ''Vacation Activity'' in the above influence diagram.

Scenario 1 is the best possible scenario for this decision situation since there is no longer any uncertainty on what they care about (''Weather Condition'') when making their decision.  Scenario 3, however, is the worst possible scenario for this decision situation since they need to make their decision without any hint (''Weather Forecast'') on what they care about (''Weather Condition'') will turn out to be.

The decision-maker is usually better off (definitely no worse off) to move from scenario 3 to scenario 2 through the acquisition of new information.  The most they should be willing to pay for such move is called the [[value of information]] on ''Weather Forecast'', which is essentially the [[expected value of sample information|value of imperfect information]] on ''Weather Condition''.

Likewise, it is the best for the decision-maker to move from scenario 3 to scenario 1.  The most they should be willing to pay for such move is called the [[Expected value of perfect information|value of perfect information]] on ''Weather Condition''.

The applicability of this simple ID and the value of information concept is tremendous, especially in [[Decision-making|medical decision making]] when most decisions have to be made with imperfect information about their patients, diseases, etc.

==Related concepts==

Influence diagrams are hierarchical and can be defined either in terms of their structure or in greater detail in terms of the functional and numerical relation between diagram elements.  An ID that is consistently defined at all levels&amp;mdash;structure, function, and number&amp;mdash;is a well-defined mathematical representation and is referred to as a ''well-formed influence diagram'' (WFID).  WFIDs can be evaluated using [[Node reversal|reversal]] and [[Node removal|removal]] operations to yield answers to a large class of probabilistic, inferential, and decision questions.  More recent techniques have been developed by [[artificial intelligence]] researchers concerning [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian network inference]] ([[belief propagation]]).

An influence diagram having only uncertainty nodes (i.e., a Bayesian network) is also called a '''relevance diagram'''.  An arc connecting node ''A'' to ''B'' implies not only that "''A'' is relevant to ''B''", but also that "''B'' is relevant to ''A''" (i.e., [[relevance]] is a [[symmetric]] relationship).

'''Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑː|m|ər}}; May 21, 1960 – November 28, 1994), also known as the '''Milwaukee Cannibal''' or the '''Milwaukee Monster''', was an American [[serial killer]] and [[sex offender]], who committed the [[rape]], [[murder]], and [[dismemberment]] of 17 men and boys from 1978 to 1991. Many of his later murders involved [[necrophilia]],&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 136"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human cannibalism|cannibalism]], and the permanent preservation of body parts — typically all or part of the [[skeleton]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]],&lt;ref name="RD"&gt;{{cite book |first= Robert J.|last= Dvorchak |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffery Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |year= 1991 |publisher= [[Dell Publishing]]|location=New York City|isbn= 978-0-440-21286-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[schizotypal personality disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J.

Convicted of 15 of the 16 murders he had committed in [[Wisconsin]], Dahmer was sentenced to 15 terms of [[life imprisonment]] on February 15, 1992.&lt;ref name=murder1&gt;{{cite book|editor-first=Duncan|editor-last=Campbell|title=Murder In Mind - Jeffrey Dahmer the Milwaukee serial killer|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|location=London, England|issue=5|ISSN=1364-5803}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later sentenced to a 16th term of life imprisonment for an additional homicide committed in [[Ohio]] in 1978.

On November 28, 1994, Dahmer was beaten to death by [[Christopher Scarver]], a fellow inmate at the [[Columbia Correctional Institution (Wisconsin)|Columbia Correctional Institution]].

==Early life==

=== Early childhood ===
Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer was born at the Evangelical Deaconess Hospital in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; on May 21, 1960, the first of two sons born to Joyce Annette (née Flint) and Lionel Herbert Dahmer. Dahmer's mother worked as a [[Teleprinter|teletype machine]] instructor,&lt;ref name=murder1/&gt; and his father was a student at [[Marquette University]], working towards a degree in chemistry. His father was of [[German Americans|German]] and [[Welsh Americans|Welsh]] ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his mother was of [[Norwegian Americans|Norwegian]] and [[Irish Americans|Irish]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Charles |last= Klotsche| title= The Silent Victims: The Aftermath of Failed Children on Their Mothers' Lives  |publisher=[[Pan American Press]] |location=Los Angeles, California|year= 1995|isbn= 0-9673890-2-X |pages= 19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that Dahmer was deprived of attention as an infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Willem |last=Martens |title=Sadism Linked to Loneliness: Psychodynamic dimensions of the Sadistic Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer |journal=[[Psychoanalytic Review]] |publisher=[[Guilford Press]]|location=New York City|date=August 2011 |volume=98|issue=4|pages=493–514 |doi= 10.1521/prev.2011.98.4.493 |pmid=21864144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Dahmer's mother found the routine of [[breastfeeding]] exhausting and irritating, she refused to feed her son in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, however, suggest that Dahmer was doted upon as an infant and toddler by both parents, although his mother was known to be tense, greedy for attention, and argumentative with her husband and their neighbors.&lt;ref name="MiM-p11" /&gt;

As her son entered first grade, Joyce Dahmer began to spend an increasing amount of her time in bed recovering from weakness. Lionel's university studies kept him away from home much of the time; when he was home, his wife demanded constant attention. She reportedly worked herself into a state of anxiety over trivial matters simply to appease her husband. On one occasion, Joyce Dahmer attempted suicide from an overdose of the [[Meprobamate|Equanil]] pills to which she had become addicted.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 32"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, neither parent devoted much time to their son.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 32"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dahmer has been described as being an "energetic and happy child" until he became notably subdued after undergoing a [[Inguinal hernia surgery|double hernia]] surgery, which was performed shortly before his fourth birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeffrey Dahmer|url=https://www.biography.com/people/jeffrey-dahmer-9264755|website=[[Biography.com]]|publisher=[[A&amp;E Networks]]|accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled his early years of family life as being of "extreme tension" which he noted between his parents, whom he observed to be constantly arguing with each other. At elementary school, he was regarded as both quiet and timid by his peers. On his first grade report card, one teacher described Dahmer as a reserved child whom she sensed felt neglected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; This teacher did note that this sense of neglect seemed to stem from his mother's illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, although largely reserved and uncommunicative in grade school, Dahmer did have a small number of friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an early age, Dahmer manifested an interest in animals. Friends later recalled Dahmer initially collected large insects, dragonflies, and butterflies, which he placed inside jars. Later, he collected animal carcasses from the roadside, occasionally accompanied by one or more of his few friends; he dismembered these animals either at home or in an expanse of woodland behind the family home. According to one friend, Dahmer dismembered these animals and stored the parts in jars in the family's wooden toolshed, always explaining that he was curious as to how each animal "fitted together".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one instance, he [[decapitation|decapitated]] the carcass of a dog before nailing the animal's body to a tree. He later impaled the skull of this dog&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon a stake beside a wooden cross in woodland behind his house.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=80}} Dahmer's fascination with dead animals might have begun when, at the age of four, he noted his father removing animal bones from beneath the family home. According to Lionel Dahmer, his son was "oddly thrilled" by the sound the bones made, and instantly developed a fixation for playing with and collecting animal bones. He occasionally searched beneath and around the family home for additional bones. With live animals, he explored their bodies to discover where their bones were located.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 32" /&gt;

The Dahmer family relocated to [[Doylestown, Ohio]], in October 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Joyce Dahmer was pregnant with her second child. When she gave birth to a baby boy on December 18, 1966, Jeffrey was allowed to choose the name of the baby. He chose the name David for his younger brother.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=61}} The same year, Lionel Dahmer achieved his degree and subsequently obtained employment as an [[analytical chemistry|analytical chemist]] in the city of [[Akron, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Donald A.|last=Davis|title=The Jeffrey Dahmer Story: An American Nightmare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSXCEA7LpjsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=lionel+dahmer+analytical+chemist#v=onepage&amp;q=lionel%20dahmer%20analytical%20chemist|date=November 15, 1991|publisher=[[St. Martin's Paperbacks]]|location=New York City|ISBN=978-0312928407|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the family relocated to [[Bath Township, Summit County, Ohio|Bath, Ohio]]. Two years later, over a family meal of chicken, Dahmer asked his father what would happen if the bones of the chicken were to be placed in a bleach solution.&lt;ref name="Shrine-p39"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lionel Dahmer was, by this stage, concerned as to his elder son's placid and [[lethargy|lethargic]] attitude and his solitary existence; therefore, he was delighted at the initiative displayed by his son towards what he believed to be scientific curiosity.&lt;ref name="Shrine-p39" /&gt; He willingly demonstrated to his son how to safely bleach and (later) preserve animal bones. This knowledge regarding the cleansing and preserving of bones was used by Dahmer on many of the animal remains which he continued to avidly collect.&lt;ref name=stoughton&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence and high school===
From his freshman year at [[Revere High School (Ohio)|Revere High School]], Dahmer was seen by his peers as an [[outcast (person)|outcast]] with few friends.{{refn|group=n|It has been suggested, in a 2002 paper by Silva, Ferrari and Leong published in the ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', that Dahmer may have suffered from [[Asperger syndrome]].{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}}} Many of Dahmer's classmates later recollected being disturbed by the fact that he drank both beer and [[distilled beverage|hard alcohol]], which he smuggled into school inside the lining of his army fatigue jacket&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concealed in his locker. This drinking occurred before, during, and after school, and was first noted when Dahmer was 14. On one occasion, a classmate observed Dahmer consuming a cup of [[gin]] and asked him why he was drinking liquor in class, to which Dahmer casually replied, "It's my medicine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=James|last1=Barron |first2=Mary B. W.|last2=Tabor |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JTUdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oKUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6988,582043 |title=Dahmer spent years crying out for attention |newspaper=[[Tuscaloosa News]] |publisher=New Media Investment Group, Inc.|location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama|date=August 3, 1991 |accessdate=August 24, 2017|pages=1A, 6A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in his freshman year at Revere High School, Dahmer, although largely uncommunicative, was observed by staff to be a polite student who was known to be highly intelligent. He initially achieved only average grades, which staff attributed to his [[apathy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known to have been a keen tennis player and to have briefly played in the high school band.&lt;ref name="Shrine-p42"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Jeffrey Dahmer HS Yearbook.jpg|140px|thumb|Dahmer at age 17, photographed for the 1977 Revere High School yearbook.]]

When he reached puberty, Dahmer discovered he was [[Homosexuality|homosexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not divulge his sexual orientation to his parents. In his early teens, he did engage in a brief relationship with another youth, although the pair never had intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; By his later admission, he began sexually fantasizing about dominating and controlling a completely submissive male partner. These fantasies gradually became intertwined with [[dissection]]. On one occasion, when he was approximately 16 years old, Dahmer conceived a [[rape fantasy]] of rendering a particular male jogger he found attractive [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] and then making sexual use of his unconscious body. To render the man unconscious, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes on the route he had noted the jogger took, baseball bat in hand, and lay in wait for him to run by. The jogger did not pass by on that particular day, however. Although Dahmer never attempted to implement this plan again,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; he later stated this was his first attempt to attack another individual.

Despite being regarded as a loner and an oddball among his peers at Revere High School, Dahmer became something of a [[wikt:class clown|class clown]] among some students due to the pranks he regularly staged—some of which were done to amuse his classmates, others apparently to simply attract attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pranks became known as "Doing a Dahmer" and included bleating, simulating [[epileptic seizure]]s or [[cerebral palsy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |first= John |last=Backderf|title= My Friend Dahmer |publisher= [[Abrams ComicArts]] |location=New York City|year= 2012 |isbn= 978-1-4197-0217-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knocking over items at school and at local stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1977, Dahmer's grades had declined, owing to his alcohol abuse and his continuing apathy toward academic and social interactions.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=76–79}} His parents hired a private tutor for their son, but the tutor only had limited success. The same year, Dahmer's parents attended counseling sessions to try to resolve personal differences and thus save their marriage. The counseling was ultimately unsuccessful, and they decided to divorce. Although initially on amicable grounds, both of Dahmer's parents began to quarrel frequently in the presence of their sons and, in early 1978, Lionel Dahmer moved out of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1978, Dahmer graduated from high school. A few weeks before his graduation, one of his teachers observed Dahmer sitting close to the school parking lot, drinking several cans of beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the teacher threatened to report the matter, Dahmer informed him he was experiencing "a lot of problems" at home and that the school's [[school counselor|guidance counselor]] was aware of them. Shortly after this incident, Joyce was awarded [[child custody|custody]] of her younger son and vacated the family residence, moving in with family members of hers; Dahmer, having just turned 18, was legally an adult and therefore not subject to court custodial considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Late teens and early 20s ==

===First murder and Army service===
Dahmer committed his first murder in the summer of 1978 at the age of 18, just three weeks after his graduation. At the time, he was living alone in the family home. Owing to his recent divorce from Dahmer's mother, Dahmer's father temporarily lived in a nearby motel and his mother had relocated to [[Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his younger brother David. On June 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer picked up a hitchhiker named Steven Mark Hicks who was four days shy of his 19th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Robert J.|last1=Dvorchak|first2=Lisa|last2=Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |publisher=[[Dell Publishing]]|location=New York City|year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mary B.W.|last=Taylor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/12/us/sorrow-and-frustration-on-trails-of-the-missing.html |title=Sorrow and Frustration On Trails of the Missing|work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=August 12, 1991|access-date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer lured the youth to his house on the pretext of the two young men drinking alcohol together. Hicks, who had been hitchhiking to a rock concert in Lockwood Corners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed to accompany Dahmer to his house. According to Dahmer, after several hours' drinking and listening to music, Hicks "wanted to leave and [I] didn't want him to."&lt;ref name="PurcellArrigo2006"&gt;{{cite book |first2=Bruce |last2= A. Arrigo |first= Catherine E. |last= Purcell |title= The Psychology of Lust Murder: Paraphilia, Sexual Killing, and Serial Homicide|url= https://books.google.com/?id=ScBmlAEACAAJ&amp;pg=PA77 |year= 2006 |publisher= Academic Press |location=New York City|isbn= 978-0-12-370510-5 |page= 77 |chapter= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Dahmer bludgeoned him with a 10&amp;nbsp;lb. [[dumbbell]]. Dahmer later stated he struck Hicks twice from behind&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the dumbbell as Hicks sat upon a chair. When Hicks fell unconscious, Dahmer [[strangulation|strangled]] him to death with the bar of the dumbbell, then stripped the clothes from Hicks' body before [[masturbating]] as he stood above the corpse.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The following day,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer dissected Hicks' body in his [[crawl space (basement)|crawl space]]; he later buried the remains in a shallow grave in his backyard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jody M.|last=Roy|title=''Love to Hate''|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York City|year=2002|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; before, several weeks later, unearthing the remains and [[paring knife|paring]] the flesh from the bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; He dissolved the flesh in acid before flushing the solution down the toilet; he crushed the bones with a [[sledgehammer]] and scattered them in the woodland behind the family home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robert J.|last1=Dvorchak|first2=Lisa|last2=Holewa |title=Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders|year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |pages= 43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six weeks after the murder of Hicks, Dahmer's father and his fiancée returned to his home where they discovered Jeffrey living alone at the house. That August, Dahmer enrolled at [[the Ohio State University]], hoping to major in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Robert J. Dvorchak|author2=Lisa Holewa |title=Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer's sole term at Ohio State University was completely unproductive, largely because of his persistent alcohol abuse throughout the majority of the term. He received failing grades in Introduction to Anthropology, Classical Civilizations, and Administrative Science. The only course Dahmer was successful at was Riflery, having received a B- grade. His overall GPA was 0.45/4.0.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=105}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=103–104}} On one occasion, Lionel Dahmer paid a surprise visit to his son, only to find his room strewn with empty liquor bottles. Despite his father having paid in advance for the second term, Dahmer dropped out of university after just three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; on his father's urging, Dahmer enlisted in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]],{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=107}} where he trained as a medical specialist at [[Fort Sam Houston]] in San Antonio, Texas. On July 13, 1979, he was stationed in [[Baumholder]], [[West Germany]], where he served as a combat medic in [[68th Armor Regiment|2nd Battalion, 68th Armored Regiment]], [[8th Infantry Division (United States)|8th Infantry Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=James |last1=Barron |first2=Mary B. W.|last2=Tabor|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/04/us/17-killed-and-a-life-is-searched-for-clues.html|title=17 Killed, and a Life Is Searched for Clues|work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=August 4, 1991|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to published reports, in Dahmer's first year of service, he was an "average or slightly above average" soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=108–109}} Two soldiers attest to having been raped by Dahmer while in the army; one of whom stated in 2010 that while stationed at Baumholder, Dahmer had repeatedly raped him over a 17-month period, while another soldier believes Dahmer drugged and raped him inside an [[armored personnel carrier]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Usborne|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/soldiers-sexual-abuse-and-the-serial-killer-the-us-military-s-secret-sexual-assaults-8679271.html|title=Soldiers, Sexual Abuse – and the Serial Killer: The US Military's Secret Sexual Assaults |work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent Print Ltd.|location=London, England|date=June 28, 2013|access-date=November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Jennifer|last1=Freyd|first2=Pamela|last2=Birrell|title=Blind to Betrayal: Why We Fool Ourselves We Aren't Being Fooled|publisher=Turner Publishing|location=Nashville, Tennessee|ISBN=9780470604403|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to Dahmer's alcohol abuse, his performance deteriorated and, in March 1981, he was deemed unsuitable for military service and was later discharged from the Army.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=110–111}} He received an [[honorable discharge]], as his superiors did not believe that any problems Dahmer had in the Army would be applicable to civilian life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 1981, Dahmer was sent to [[Fort Jackson (South Carolina)|Fort Jackson]], South Carolina, for debriefing and provided with a plane ticket to travel anywhere in the country. Dahmer later told police he felt he could not return home to face his father, so he opted to travel to [[Miami Beach, Florida]], both because he was "tired of the cold"&lt;ref name="adamWalsh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wisn.com/news/10903529/detail.html |title=Did Dahmer Have One More Victim? |work=The Milwaukee Channel |accessdate=February 5, 2007 |date=February 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222031507/http://www.wisn.com/news/10903529/detail.html |archivedate=February 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in an attempt to live on his own means. In Florida, Dahmer found employment at a [[delicatessen]] and rented a room in a nearby motel. Dahmer spent most of his salary on alcohol, and was soon evicted from the motel for non-payment. He initially spent his evenings on the beach as he continued to work at the sandwich shop until phoning his father and asking to return to Ohio in September of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Ohio and relocation to West Allis, Wisconsin===
After his return to Ohio, Dahmer initially resided with his father and stepmother and insisted on being delegated numerous chores to occupy his time while he looked for work. However, he continued to drink heavily and, just two weeks after his return, Dahmer was arrested for [[public intoxication|drunk and disorderly conduct]],{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=114}} for which he was fined $60 and given a [[suspended sentence|suspended 10-day jail sentence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer's father tried unsuccessfully to wean his son off alcohol. In December 1981, Dahmer's father and stepmother sent him to live with his grandmother in [[West Allis, Wisconsin|West Allis]], Wisconsin. Dahmer's grandmother was the only family member to whom he displayed any affection;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; they hoped that her influence, plus the change of scenery, might inspire Dahmer to refrain from alcohol, find a job, and live responsibly.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=115}}{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=117}} Initially, Dahmer's living arrangements with his grandmother were harmonious: he accompanied her to church; willingly undertook chores; actively sought work; and abided by most of her house rules (although he did continue to drink and smoke).{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=83}} This new influence in his life initially brought results and, in early 1982, Dahmer found employment as a [[phlebotomy|phlebotomist]] at the Milwaukee Blood Plasma Center. He held this job for a total of 10 months before being laid off.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; He remained unemployed for over two years, during which he lived upon whatever money his grandmother gave him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jeffrey-dahmer.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Mug shot of Jeffrey Dahmer, taken in 1982 after his arrest for [[indecent exposure]]]]
Shortly before losing his job, Dahmer was arrested for [[indecent exposure]]. On August 7, 1982, at [[Wisconsin State Fair Park]], Dahmer was observed to expose himself to a crowd of 25 women and children. For this incident, he was convicted and fined $50 plus [[court costs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1985, Dahmer was hired as a mixer at the Milwaukee Ambrosia Chocolate Factory, where he worked from 11 p.m to 7 a.m. six nights per week, with Saturday evenings off. Shortly after Dahmer found this employment, an incident occurred in which he was propositioned by another man while sitting reading in the West Allis Public Library. The stranger threw Dahmer a note offering to perform [[fellatio]] upon him. Although Dahmer did not respond to this proposition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incident stirred in his mind the fantasies of control and dominance he had developed as a teenager, and he began to familiarize himself with Milwaukee's [[gay bar]]s, bookstores and [[gay bathhouse]]s. He is also known to have stolen a male [[mannequin]] from a store,{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=119–120}} which he briefly used for sexual stimulation before his grandmother, having discovered the item stowed in a closet, demanded that he discard it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1985, he had begun to regularly frequent the bathhouses, which he later described as being "relaxing places",&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; but during his sexual encounters, he became frustrated at his partners' moving during the sexual act. Following his arrest, he stated: "I trained myself to view people as objects of pleasure instead of [as] people".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; For this reason, beginning in June 1986, he administered [[hypnotic|sleeping pills]] to his partners, giving them liquor laced with the sedatives, then raping their unconscious bodies. After approximately 12 such instances, the bathhouses' administration revoked Dahmer's membership, and he began to use hotel rooms to continue this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after his membership of the bathhouses was revoked,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer read a report in a newspaper regarding the upcoming funeral of an 18-year-old male; he conceived the idea of stealing the freshly interred corpse and taking it home.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book |last= Schwartz |first= Anne E |title= The Man Who Could Not Kill Enough: The Secret Murders of Milwaukee's Jeffrey Dahmer |date= June 1992 |publisher= Citadel |isbn= 978-1-55972-117-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dahmer, he attempted to dig the coffin from the ground, but found the soil too hard, before abandoning the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1986,{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=131}} Dahmer was arrested for masturbating in front of two 12-year-old boys as he stood close to the [[Kinnickinnic River (Milwaukee River)|Kinnickinnic River]].&lt;ref name="Bardsley-7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer initially admitted the offense and was again charged with indecent exposure, but quickly changed his story and claimed he had merely been urinating, unaware that there were witnesses. The charge was changed to [[disorderly conduct]] and, on March 10, 1987, Dahmer was sentenced to one year's [[probation]], with additional instructions he was to undergo counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 20s and early 30s: subsequent murders==

===Ambassador Hotel===
On November 20, 1987, Dahmer—at the time residing with his grandmother in West Allis, Wisconsin—encountered a 25-year-old man from [[Ontonagon, Michigan]] named Steven Tuomi at a bar and persuaded him to return to the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Dahmer had rented a room for the evening. According to Dahmer, he had no intention of murdering Tuomi, but simply intended to drug and rape him as he lay unconscious. The following morning, however, he awoke to find Tuomi lying beneath him on the bed, his chest "crushed in" and "black and blue" with bruises. Blood was also seeping from the corner of his mouth, and Dahmer's fists and one forearm were extensively bruised. Dahmer stated he had absolutely no memory of having killed Tuomi,&lt;ref name="Bardsley-7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris 1992 141"&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later informed investigators that he simply "could not believe this had happened." To dispose of Tuomi's body, he purchased a large suitcase in which he transported the body to his grandmother's residence. There, one week later,&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 110"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; he severed the head, arms, and legs from the torso,&lt;ref name="Norris 1992 141"/&gt; then filleted the bones from the body before cutting the flesh into pieces small enough to handle. He then placed the flesh inside plastic garbage bags.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 110"/&gt; He wrapped the bones inside a sheet and pounded them into [[splinter]]s with a sledgehammer. The entire dismemberment process took Dahmer approximately two hours to complete, and he disposed of all of Tuomi's remains—excluding the severed head&lt;ref name="autogenerated111"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;—in the trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a total of two weeks following Tuomi's murder, Dahmer retained the victim's head wrapped in a blanket. After two weeks, Dahmer boiled the head in a mixture of Soilex (an [[alkalinity|alkali]]-based industrial detergent) and bleach in an effort to retain the skull, which he then used as stimulus for masturbation. Eventually, the skull was rendered too brittle by this bleaching process, so Dahmer pulverized and disposed of it.&lt;ref name="autogenerated111"/&gt;

===Intermediate incidents===
Following the murder of Tuomi, Dahmer began to actively seek victims, most of whom he encountered in or close to gay bars, and whom he typically lured to his grandmother's home. There, he drugged them before or shortly after engaging in sexual activity with them. Once he had rendered the victim unconscious with sleeping pills, he killed them by strangulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jody M.|last=Roy|title=Love to Hate|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York City|date=2002|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after the murder of Steven Tuomi, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old Native American [[male prostitute]] named James Doxtator; Dahmer lured the youth to his home with an offer of $50 to pose for nude pictures. At Dahmer's West Allis residence, the pair engaged in sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Doxtator and strangled him on the floor of the cellar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer left the body in the cellar for one week before dismembering it in much the same manner as he had with Tuomi. He placed all of Doxtator's remains (excluding the skull) in the trash. He boiled the skull, and initially retained it before pulverizing it. On March 24, 1988, Dahmer met a 22-year-old [[bisexuality|bisexual]] man named Richard Guerrero outside a gay bar called The Phoenix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer lured Guerrero to his grandmother's residence, although the incentive on this occasion was $50 to simply spend the remainder of the night with him;&lt;ref name="autogenerated121"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; he then drugged Guerrero with sleeping pills and strangled him with a leather strap, with Dahmer then performing [[oral sex]] upon the corpse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated121"/&gt; Guerrero's body was dismembered within 24&amp;nbsp;hours of his murder, with the remains again disposed of in the trash and the skull again retained before being pulverized several months later.&lt;ref name="autogenerated129"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 23, Dahmer lured another young man to his house; however, after giving the victim a drugged coffee, both he and the victim heard Dahmer's grandmother call, "Is that you, Jeff?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dahmer replied in a manner that led his grandmother to believe he was alone, his grandmother did observe that Dahmer was not alone. Because of this, Dahmer opted not to kill this particular victim, instead waiting until he had become unconscious before taking him to the County General Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&amp;dat=19920208&amp;id=4OgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yjIHAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3993,4435325 |title=Teen describes escape from Dahmer |work=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]]|location=Lodi, California|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 8, 1992 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1988, Dahmer's grandmother asked him to move out of her house because of his habit of bringing young men to her house late at night and the foul smells emanating from both the basement and the garage. Dahmer found a one-bedroom apartment on North 25th Street and moved into his new residence on September 25.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=132}} The following day, Dahmer was arrested for drugging and [[child sexual abuse|sexually fondling]] a 13-year-old boy whom he had lured to his home on the pretext of posing nude for photographs.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=133–135}} In January 1989, Dahmer was convicted of second-degree [[sexual assault]] and of enticing a child for immoral purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sentencing for the assault was suspended until May 1989.&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Robert J. |last1=Dvorchak|first2=Lisa|last2=Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |publisher=[[Dell Publishing]]|location=New York City|year= 1992 |page= 63|isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer commenced a 10-day Easter absence from work, during which he moved back into his grandmother's home.

Two months after his conviction and two months prior to his sentencing for the sexual assault, Dahmer murdered his fifth victim. He was a [[mixed-race]] 24-year-old aspiring model named Anthony Sears, whom Dahmer met at a gay bar on March 25, 1989. According to Dahmer, on this particular occasion, he was not looking to commit a crime; however, shortly before [[last call (bar term)|closing time]] that evening, Sears "just started talking to me". Dahmer lured Sears to his grandmother's home, where the pair engaged in oral sex before Dahmer drugged and strangled Sears. The following morning, Dahmer placed the corpse in his grandmother's bathtub, where he decapitated the body before attempting to [[flaying|flay]] the corpse.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 136"/&gt; He then stripped the flesh from the body and pulverized the bones, which were again disposed of in the trash. According to Dahmer, he found Sears "exceptionally attractive", and Sears was the first victim from whom he permanently retained any body parts: he preserved Sears' head and genitalia in [[acetone]]&lt;ref name="Bardsley-8" /&gt; and stored them in his work locker. When he moved to a new address the following year, he took the remains there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 1989,&lt;ref name="autogenerated63"/&gt; Dahmer was sentenced to five years' probation and one year in the House of Correction, with [[work release]] permitted in order that he be able to keep his job; he was also required to register as a [[sex offender]].{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=138}}

Two months before his scheduled release from the work camp, Dahmer was paroled from this regime. (His five years' probation imposed in 1989 began at this point.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; On release, Dahmer temporarily moved back to his grandmother's home in West Allis{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|pp=143–144}} before, in May 1990, moving into the Oxford Apartments, located on North 25th Street in Milwaukee. Although located in a high crime area, the apartment was close to his workplace, was furnished and, at $300 per month inclusive of all bills excluding electricity, was economical.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===924 North 25th Street===

==== 1990 killings ====
On May 14, 1990, Dahmer moved out of his grandmother's house and into 924 North 25th Street, Apartment 213, taking Anthony Sears' skull, scalp, and painted genitals with him.&lt;ref name="autogenerated139"/&gt; Within one week of his moving into his new apartment, Dahmer had killed his sixth victim, Raymond Smith. Smith was a 32-year-old male prostitute whom Dahmer lured to Apartment 213 with the promise of $50 for sex.&lt;ref name="autogenerated141"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Dahmer's apartment, he gave Smith a drink laced with seven sleeping pills and manually strangled him. The following day, Dahmer purchased a Polaroid camera with which he took several pictures of Smith's body in suggestive positions before dismembering him in the bathroom. He boiled the legs, arms, and pelvis in a steel kettle with Soilex, which allowed him to then rinse the bones in his sink;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; he dissolved the remainder of Smith's skeleton—excluding the skull—in a container he filled with acid. He spray-painted Smith's skull and placed it alongside the skull of Anthony Sears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Robert J. Dvorchak|author2=Lisa Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately one week after the murder of Raymond Smith, on or about May 27, Dahmer lured another young man to his apartment. On this occasion, however, Dahmer himself accidentally consumed the drink laden with sedatives intended for consumption by his guest. When he awoke the following day, he discovered his intended victim had stolen several items of his clothing, $300, and a watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=142–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer never reported this incident to the police, although on May 29, he divulged to his probation officer that he had been robbed.

In June 1990, Dahmer lured a 27-year-old acquaintance named Edward Smith to his apartment. He drugged and strangled Smith. On this occasion, rather than immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching (which had rendered previous victims' skulls brittle), Dahmer placed Smith's skeleton in his freezer for several months in the hope it would not retain moisture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated146"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton of this victim would be acidified several months later. Dahmer accidentally destroyed the skull when he placed it in the oven to dry—a process that caused the skull to explode.&lt;ref name="autogenerated146"/&gt; Dahmer himself was to later inform police he had felt "rotten" about Smith's murder as he had been unable to retain any parts of his body.&lt;ref name="autogenerated146"/&gt;

Less than three months after the murder of Smith, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old Chicago native named Ernest Miller on the corner of North 27th Street. Miller agreed to accompany Dahmer to his apartment for $50 and further agreed to allow him to listen to his heart and stomach. When Dahmer attempted to perform oral sex upon Miller, he was informed: "That'll cost you extra,"&lt;ref name="autogenerated153"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon Dahmer gave his intended victim a drink laced with two sleeping pills. On this occasion, however, he had had only two sleeping pills to give his victim; therefore, he killed Miller by slashing his [[carotid artery]] with the same knife he used to dissect his victims' bodies. Miller bled to death within minutes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated154"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer then posed the nude body for various suggestive Polaroid photographs before placing the body in his bathtub for dismemberment. Dahmer repeatedly kissed and talked to the severed head while he dismembered the remainder of the body.&lt;ref name="autogenerated154" /&gt; He wrapped Miller's heart, biceps, and portions of flesh from the legs in plastic bags and placed them in the fridge for later consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer boiled the remaining flesh and organs into a "jelly-like substance" using Soilex, which again enabled him to rinse the flesh off the skeleton, which he intended to retain. To preserve the skeleton, he placed the bones in a light bleach solution for 24&amp;nbsp;hours before allowing them to dry upon a cloth for one week; the severed head was initially placed in the refrigerator before also being stripped of flesh, then painted and coated with enamel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks after the murder of Ernest Miller, on September 24, Dahmer encountered a 22-year-old man named David Thomas at the [[Shops of Grand Avenue|Grand Avenue Mall]] and persuaded him to return to his apartment for a few drinks, with additional money on offer if he would pose for photographs. In his statement to police after his arrest, Dahmer stated that, after giving Thomas a drink laden with sedatives, he did not feel attracted to him, but was afraid to allow him to awake in case he would be angry over having been drugged. Therefore, he strangled him and dismembered the body—intentionally retaining no body parts whatsoever. Nonetheless, he did photograph the dismemberment process and retained these photographs, which later aided in Thomas's subsequent identification.&lt;ref name="autogenerated217"&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the murder of David Thomas, Dahmer did not kill anyone for almost five months, although on a minimum of five occasions between October 1990 and February 1991, he unsuccessfully attempted to lure men to his apartment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated153"/&gt; He is also known to have regularly complained of feelings of both [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and depression to his probation officer throughout 1990; with frequent references to his sexuality, his solitary lifestyle, and financial difficulties. On several occasions, he is also known to have referred to harboring suicidal thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1991 killings ====
In February 1991, Dahmer observed a 17-year-old named Curtis Straughter standing at a bus stop near [[Marquette University]]. According to Dahmer, he lured Straughter into his apartment with an offer of money for posing for nude photos,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the added incentive of sexual intercourse. Dahmer drugged and strangled Straughter with a leather strap, then dismembered him, with Dahmer retaining the youth's skull, hands, and genitals and photographing each stage of the dismemberment process. Less than two months later, on April 7, Dahmer encountered a 19-year-old named Errol Lindsey&lt;ref name="Bardsley-10" /&gt;{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=211}} walking to get a key cut. Lindsey was heterosexual. Dahmer lured Lindsey to his apartment, where he drugged him, drilled a hole in his skull and poured [[hydrochloric acid]] into it. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this experiment (which Dahmer had conceived in the hope of inducing a permanent, unresistant, submissive state), saying: "I have a headache. What time is it?"{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=128}}&lt;ref&gt;Killers, issue 5, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, Dahmer again drugged Lindsey, then strangled him. He decapitated Lindsey and retained his skull; he then flayed Lindsey's body, placing the skin in a solution of cold water and salt for several weeks in the hope of permanently retaining it. Reluctantly, Dahmer disposed of Lindsey's skin when he noted it had become too frayed and brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1991, fellow residents of the Oxford Apartments had repeatedly complained to the manager of the Oxford Apartments, Sopa Princewill, of the foul smells emanating from Apartment 213, in addition to the sounds of falling objects and the occasional sound of a chainsaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Alex|last=Prud'Homme|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,973550-1,00.html |title=The Little Flat of Horrors|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=August 5, 1991 |accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princewill did contact Dahmer in response to these complaints on several occasions, although Dahmer initially excused the odors emanating from his apartment as being caused by his freezer breaking, causing the contents to become "spoiled". On later occasions, he informed Princewill that the reason for the resurgence of the odor was that several of his tropical fish had recently died, and that he would take care of the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the afternoon of May 26, 1991, Dahmer encountered a 14-year-old named Konerak Sinthasomphone on Wisconsin Avenue; he approached the youth with an offer of money to accompany him to his apartment to pose for Polaroid pictures. According to Dahmer, Sinthasomphone—the younger brother of the boy whom he had molested in 1988—was initially reluctant to the proposal, before changing his mind and accompanying Dahmer to his apartment, where the youth posed for two pictures in his underwear before Dahmer drugged him into unconsciousness and performed oral sex on him. On this occasion, Dahmer drilled a single hole into Sinthasomphone's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the [[frontal lobe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before Sinthasomphone fell unconscious, Dahmer led the boy into his bedroom, where the nude body of 31-year-old Tony Hughes, whom Dahmer had killed three days earlier, lay naked on the floor.&lt;ref name="Norris 1992 235"&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dahmer, he "believed [that Sinthasomphone] saw this body," yet did not react to seeing the bloated corpse—likely because of the effects of the sleeping pills he had ingested and the hydrochloric acid Dahmer had injected through his skull. Sinthasomphone soon became unconscious, whereupon Dahmer drank several beers while lying alongside Sinthasomphone before leaving his apartment to drink at a bar, then purchase more alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early morning hours of May 27, Dahmer returned toward his apartment to discover Sinthasomphone sitting naked on the corner of 25th and State, talking in [[Lao Language|Laotian]], with three distressed young women standing near him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Crocker| last=Stephenson|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oLUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wBIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3124,5920894 |title=2 women say police failed to aid 14-year-old |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |date=July 26, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer approached the trio and explained to the women that Sinthasomphone (whom he referred to by an [[pseudonym|alias]]) was his friend, and attempted to lead him to his apartment by the arm. The three women dissuaded Dahmer, explaining they had phoned 911.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=7}} Upon the arrival of two officers named [[John Balcerzak]] and Joseph Gabrish, Dahmer's demeanor relaxed: he informed the officers that Sinthasomphone was his 19-year-old boyfriend, that he had drunk too much following a quarrel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/26/us/officer-defends-giving-boy-back-to-dahmer.html |title=Officer Defends Giving Boy Back to Dahmer |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=August 26, 1991|access-date=December 14, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he frequently behaved in this manner when [[alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]]. The three women were exasperated and when one of the trio attempted to indicate to one of the officers that Sinthasomphone was bleeding from his buttocks and that he had seemingly struggled against Dahmer's attempts to walk him to his apartment, the officer harshly informed her to "butt out,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James|last=Barron |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/27/us/milwaukee-police-once-queried-suspect.html |title=Milwaukee Police Once Queried Suspect |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 27, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "shut the hell up"&lt;ref name="autogenerated179"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to not interfere, adding the incident was "[[domestic violence|domestic]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anne E.|last=Schwartz|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4DcdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6723,3131596|title=Suspended officers say the public doesn't know the whole story |work=The Milwaukee Journal |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|date=July 28, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Against the protests of the three women, the officers simply covered Sinthasomphone with a towel and walked him to Dahmer's apartment where, in an effort to verify his claim that he and Sinthasomphone were lovers, Dahmer showed the officers the two semi-nude Polaroid pictures he had taken of the youth the previous evening. The officers later reported having noted a strange scent reminiscent of excrement inside the apartment (this odor emanated from the decomposing body of Hughes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Imrie |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xe0eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bCQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5153,134140 |title=Officers were in Dahmer's apartment |agency=Associated Press|work=The Times-News |publisher=[[New Media Investment Group]]|location=Burlington, North Carolina|date=August 2, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer stated that to investigate this, one officer simply "peeked his head around the bedroom but really didn't take a good look." The officers then left, with a departing remark that Dahmer "take good care" of Sinthasomphone.&lt;ref name="autogenerated179"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had they conducted a background check on Dahmer, it would have revealed that he was a convicted [[child molestation|child molester]] under probation.&lt;ref name="Bardsley-3" /&gt; Upon the departure of the two police officers from his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain; on this second occasion, the injection proved fatal. The following day, May 28, Dahmer took a day's leave from work to devote himself to the dismemberment of the bodies of Sinthasomphone and Hughes. He retained both victims' skulls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Having left Sinthasomphone in the company of Dahmer, the patrol unit which had responded to the women's 911 call then radioed their dispatch unit.

On June 30 Dahmer traveled to Chicago, where he encountered a 20-year-old named Matt Turner at a bus station.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner accepted Dahmer's offer to travel to Milwaukee for a [[photo shoot|professional photo shoot]]. At Dahmer's apartment, Dahmer drugged, strangled and dismembered Turner and placed his head and internal organs in separate plastic bags in the freezer. Turner was not reported missing. Five days later, on July 5, Dahmer lured 23-year-old Jeremiah Weinberger from a Chicago bar to his apartment on the promise of spending the weekend with him. He drugged Weinberger and twice injected boiling water through his skull, sending him into a coma from which he died two days later.&lt;ref name="autogenerated188"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=188–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, Dahmer encountered 24-year-old&lt;ref name="Robert J. Dvorchak 1992 181"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Robert J.|last1=Dvorchak|first2=Lisa|last2=Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |publisher=[[Dell Publishing]]|location=New York City|year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Lacy at the corner of 27th and Kilbourn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacy agreed to Dahmer's ruse of posing nude for photographs and accompanied him to his apartment, where the pair engaged in tentative sexual activity before Dahmer drugged Lacy. On this occasion, Dahmer intended to prolong the time he spent with Lacy while alive; after unsuccessfully attempting to render Lacy unconscious with [[chloroform]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; he phoned his workplace to request a day's absence; this was granted, although the next day, he was suspended. After strangling Lacy, Dahmer had sex with the corpse before dismembering him. He placed Lacy's head and heart in the refrigerator and his skeleton in the freezer.&lt;ref name="Robert J. Dvorchak 1992 181"/&gt; Four days later, on July 19, Dahmer received word that he was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon receipt of this news, Dahmer lured 25-year-old Joseph Bradehoft to his apartment. Bradehoft was strangled and left lying on Dahmer's bed covered with a sheet for two days. On July 21, Dahmer removed these sheets to find the head covered in maggots, whereupon he decapitated the body, cleaned the head and placed it in the refrigerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later acidified Bradehoft's torso along with those of two other victims killed within the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= Robert J.|last1=Dvorchak|first2=Lisa|last2=Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |publisher=[[Dell Publishing]]|location=New York City|year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On July 22, 1991, Dahmer approached three men with an offer of $100 to accompany him to his apartment to pose for nude photographs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; drink beer and simply keep him company.&lt;ref name="autogenerated192"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the trio, 32-year-old Tracy Edwards, agreed to accompany him to his apartment. Upon entering Dahmer's apartment, Edwards noted a foul odor and several boxes of hydrochloric acid on the floor, which Dahmer claimed to use for cleaning bricks. After some minor conversation, Edwards responded to Dahmer's request to turn his head and view his tropical fish, whereupon Dahmer placed a handcuff upon his wrist. When Edwards asked, "What's happening?" Dahmer unsuccessfully attempted to cuff his wrists together,{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=151}} then told Edwards to accompany him to the bedroom to pose for nude pictures. While inside the bedroom, Edwards noted nude male posters on the wall and that a [[videotape]] of ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' was playing;&lt;ref name="autogenerated192"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL-SFva4Oko |title=The Trial of Jeffrey Dahmer - Documentary Part 12 of 16 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=February 4, 2012 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he also noted a blue [[drum (container)|57-gallon drum]] in the corner, from which a strong odor emanated.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=152}}

Dahmer then brandished a knife and informed Edwards he intended to take nude pictures of him. In an attempt to appease Dahmer, Edwards unbuttoned his shirt, saying he would allow him to do so if he would remove the handcuffs and put the knife away. In response to this promise, Dahmer simply turned his attention towards the TV; Edwards observed Dahmer rocking back and forth and [[chant]]ing before turning his attention back to him: he placed his head on Edwards' chest, listened to his [[cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] and, with the knife pressed against his intended victim, informed Edwards he intended to eat his heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In continuous attempts to prevent Dahmer from attacking him, Edwards repeated that he was Dahmer's friend and that he was not going to run away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Edwards had decided he was going to either jump from a window or run through the unlocked front door upon the next available opportunity.) When Edwards next stated he needed to use the bathroom, he asked if they could sit with a beer in the living room, where there was air conditioning, to which Dahmer consented, and the pair walked to the living room when Edwards exited the bathroom. Inside the living room, Edwards waited until he observed Dahmer have a momentary lapse of concentration before requesting to use the bathroom again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Edwards rose from the couch, he noted Dahmer was not holding the handcuffs, whereupon Edwards punched him in the face, knocking Dahmer off balance, and ran out the front door.{{sfn|Davis|1991|pp=153–154}}

At 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on July 22, Edwards flagged down two Milwaukee police officers at the corner of North 25th Street. The officers noted Edwards had a handcuff attached to his wrist,&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 2"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=154}} whereupon Edwards explained to the officers that a "freak" had placed the handcuffs upon him and asked if the police could remove them. When the officers' handcuff keys failed to fit the brand of handcuffs, Edwards agreed to accompany the officers to the apartment where, Edwards stated, he had spent the previous five hours before escaping.&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 2"/&gt; When the officers and Edwards arrived at Apartment 213, Dahmer invited the trio inside and acknowledged he had indeed placed the handcuffs upon Edwards, although he offered no explanation as to why he had done so. At this point, Edwards divulged to the officers that Dahmer had also brandished a large knife upon him and that this had happened in the bedroom. Dahmer made no comment to this revelation, indicating to one of the officers, Rolf Mueller, that the key to the handcuffs was in his bedside dresser in the bedroom. As Mueller entered the bedroom, Dahmer attempted to pass Mueller to himself retrieve the key, whereupon the second officer present, Robert Rauth, informed him to "back off".&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bedroom, Mueller noted there was indeed a large knife beneath the bed; he also saw an open drawer which, upon closer inspection, contained scores of Polaroid pictures—many of which were of human bodies in various stages of dismemberment. Mueller noted the decor indicated they had been taken in the very apartment in which they were standing. He walked into the living room to show them to his partner,&lt;ref name="Bardsley-4" /&gt; uttering the words, "These are for real."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; When Dahmer saw that Mueller was holding several of his Polaroids, he fought with the officers in an effort to resist arrest. The officers quickly overpowered him, cuffed his hands behind his back, and called a second squad car for backup. At this point, Mueller opened the refrigerator to reveal the freshly severed head of a black male on the bottom shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Dahmer lay pinned on the floor beneath Rauth, he turned his head towards the officers and muttered the words: "For what I did I should be dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more detailed search of the apartment, conducted by the Criminal Investigation Bureau, revealed a total of four severed heads in Dahmer's kitchen. A total of seven skulls—some painted, some bleached—were found in Dahmer's bedroom and inside a closet.{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=157}} In addition, investigators discovered collected blood drippings upon a tray at the bottom of Dahmer's refrigerator, plus two human hearts{{sfn|Davis|1991|p=158}} and a portion of arm muscle, each wrapped inside plastic bags upon the shelves. In Dahmer's freezer, investigators discovered an entire torso, plus a bag of human organs and flesh stuck to the ice at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in Apartment 213, investigators discovered two entire skeletons, a pair of severed hands, two severed and preserved penises, a mummified scalp and, in the 57-gallon drum, three further dismembered torsos dissolving in the acid solution. A total of 74 Polaroid pictures detailing the dismemberment of Dahmer's victims were found.&lt;ref name="Bardsley-5" /&gt; In reference to the recovery of body parts and artifacts at 924 North 25th Street, the [[coroner|chief medical examiner]] later stated: "It was more like dismantling someone's museum than an actual crime scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.medicineatmichigan.org/magazine/2009/spring/limelight/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100821014601/http://www.medicineatmichigan.org/magazine/2009/spring/limelight/ |archivedate=August 21, 2010 |work=Medicine at Michigan |title=Limelight |date=Spring 2009 |volume=11 |issue=1 |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confession===
Beginning in the early hours of July 23, 1991, Dahmer was questioned by Detective Patrick Kennedy as to the murders he had committed and the evidence found at his apartment. Over the following two weeks, Kennedy and, later, Detective Patrick Murphy conducted numerous interviews with Dahmer which, when combined, totalled over 60 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer [[waiver|waived]] his right to have a lawyer present throughout his interrogations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding he wished to confess all as he had "created this horror and it only makes sense I do everything to put an end to it."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1993"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He readily admitted to having murdered 16 young men in Wisconsin since 1987, with one further victim—Steven Hicks—killed in Ohio back in 1978.

Most of the victims had been rendered unconscious prior to their murder, although some had died as a result of having acid or boiling water injected into their brain. (As he had no memory of the murder of Tuomi, he was unsure whether he was unconscious when beaten to death, although he did concede it was possible that his viewing the exposed chest of Steven Tuomi while in a drunken stupor may have led him to unsuccessfully attempt to tear Tuomi's heart from his chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=109–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Almost all the murders Dahmer committed after moving into the Oxford Apartments had involved a ritual of posing the victims' bodies in suggestive positions—typically with the chest thrust outwards—prior to dismemberment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"/&gt; He readily admitted to performing [[necrophilia]] with several of his victims' bodies, including performing sexual acts with their [[viscus|viscera]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated159"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he dismembered their bodies in his bathtub. Having noted that much of the blood pooled inside his victims' chest after death, Dahmer first removed their internal organs, then suspended the torso so the blood drained into his bathtub, before [[dicing]] any organs he did not wish to retain and paring the flesh from the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bones he wished to dispose of were pulverized or acidified, with Soilex and bleach solutions used to aid in the preservation of the skeletons and skulls he wished to keep. In addition, he confessed to having consumed the hearts, livers, biceps, and portions of thighs of several victims killed within the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the increase in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, he stated he had been "completely swept along"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his compulsion to kill, adding: "It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked as to why he had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated he had been in the process of constructing a private [[altar]] of victims' skulls which he had intended to adorn upon the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims. This display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Ernest Miller and Oliver Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. [[Incense|Incense sticks]] were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights.&lt;ref name="autogenerated286"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair.&lt;ref name="autogenerated286"/&gt; When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview who the altar was dedicated to, Dahmer replied: "Myself ... It was a place where I could feel at home." He further described his intended altar as a "place for [[meditation]]," from where he believed he could draw a sense of power,&lt;ref name="autogenerated286"/&gt; adding: "If this [his arrest] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found."&lt;ref name="autogenerated286"/&gt;

===Indictment===

===Trial===
The trial of Jeffrey Dahmer began on January 30, 1992.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=207}} He was tried in Milwaukee for the 15 counts of murder before Judge Laurence Gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; By pleading guilty on January 13 to the charges brought against him, Dahmer had waived his rights to an initial trial to establish guilt (as defined in Wisconsin law).&lt;ref name="autogenerated215"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue debated by opposing [[counsel]]s at Dahmer's trial was to determine whether he suffered from either a [[mental disorder|mental]] or a [[personality disorder]]:&lt;ref name="autogenerated215"/&gt; the prosecution claiming that any disorders did not deprive Dahmer of the ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to deprive him of the ability to resist his [[Impulse (psychology)|impulses]]; the defense arguing that Dahmer suffered from a mental disease&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was driven by obsessions and impulses he was unable to control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=227–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defense experts argued that Dahmer was insane due to his necrophilic drive - his compulsion to have sexual encounters with corpses. Defense expert Dr. [[Fred Berlin]] testified that Dahmer was unable to conform his conduct at the time that he committed the crimes because he was suffering from [[Paraphilia]] or, more specifically, necrophilia. Dr. Judith Becker, a professor of Psychiatry and Psychology, was the second expert witness for the defense; Becker also diagnosed Dahmer with necrophilia. The final defense expert to testify, [[forensic psychiatry|forensic psychiatrist]] Dr. Carl Wahlstrom, diagnosed Dahmer with [[borderline personality disorder]], [[schizotypal personality disorder]], necrophilia, [[alcohol dependence]], and a [[psychosis|psychotic disorder]].&lt;ref name="RD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="diagnosis"&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Steve |last=Bogira |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-inner-life-of-a-psycho-killer/Content?oid=880359 |title=The inner life of a psycho killer |work=[[Chicago Reader]]|date=August 27, 1992 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="E&amp;M"&gt;{{cite book |first1= Charles Patrick |last1= Ewing|first2=Joseph T. |last2= McCann |title= Minds on Trial: Great Cases in Law and Psychology |year= 2006 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, England|isbn= 978-0-19-518176-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecution rejected the defense's argument that Dahmer was insane. Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Phillip Resnick testified that Dahmer did not suffer from primary necrophilia because he preferred live sexual partners as evidenced by his efforts to create unresistant, submissive sexual partners devoid of rational thought and to whose needs he did not have to cater.&lt;ref name="Silva"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=J.

The final witness to appear for the prosecution, forensic psychiatrist [[Park Dietz]], began his testimony on February 12. Dietz testified that he did not believe Dahmer to be suffering from any mental disease or defect at the time that he committed the crimes, stating: "Dahmer went to great lengths to be alone with his victim and to have no witnesses."&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 262"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that there was ample evidence that Dahmer prepared in advance for each murder, therefore, his crimes were not impulsive.&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal Feb. 12, 1992"&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Stingl|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dSohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4n4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4713,3624402 |title=Dahmer knew what he was doing, expert says|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=February 12, 1992 |accessdate=December 5, 2013|via=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dietz did concede any acquisition of a paraphilia was not a matter of personal choice,&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 262"/&gt; he also stated his belief that Dahmer's habit of becoming intoxicated prior to committing each of the murders was significant, stating: "If he had a compulsion to kill, he would not have to drink alcohol. He had to drink alcohol to overcome his inhibition, to do the crime which he would rather not do."&lt;ref name="Milwaukee Journal Feb. 12, 1992"/&gt; Dietz also noted that Dahmer strongly identified with evil and corrupt characters from both ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' and ''The Exorcist III''; particularly the level of power held by these characters. Expounding on the significance of these movies on Dahmer's psyche and many of the murders committed at the Oxford Apartments, Dietz explained that Dahmer occasionally viewed scenes from these films before searching for a victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people = Park Dietz | year = 1992 | title = At the movies with Jeffrey Dahmer | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98bRbgQpcGE | accessdate = 28 April 2017 | quote = | ref = DahmerTrialVideo }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dietz diagnosed Dahmer with [[substance use disorder]], paraphilia, and schizotypal personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Haycock (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two court-appointed mental health professionals—testifying independently of either prosecution or defense—were forensic psychiatrist George Palermo and clinical psychologist Samuel Friedman. Palermo stated that the murders were the result of a "pent-up aggression within himself [Dahmer]. He killed those men because he wanted to kill the source of his homosexual attraction to them. In killing them, he killed what he hated in himself." Palermo concluded that Dahmer was a sexual sadist with [[antisocial personality disorder]], but legally sane.&lt;ref&gt;Ewing (2006), 151&lt;/ref&gt; Friedman testified that it was a longing for companionship that caused Dahmer to kill. He stated, "Mr. Dahmer is not [[psychosis|psychotic]]." He spoke kindly of Dahmer, describing him as "Amiable, pleasant to be with, courteous, with a sense of humor, conventionally handsome, and charming in manner.

The trial lasted two weeks.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=211}} On February 14, both counsels delivered their [[closing argument]]s to the jury. Each counsel was allowed to speak for two hours. Defense attorney Gerald Boyle argued first. Repeatedly harking to the testimony of the mental health professionals—almost all of whom had agreed Dahmer was suffering from a mental disease&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Boyle argued that Dahmer's compulsive killings had been a result of "a sickness he discovered, not chose."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1454&amp;dat=19920215&amp;id=lHtOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oRQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1633,5266547 ''Star News'' Feb. 15, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; Boyle portrayed Dahmer as a desperately lonely and profoundly sick individual "so out of control he could not conform his conduct any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the defense counsel's 75-minute closing argument, Michael McCann delivered his closing argument for the prosecution, describing Dahmer as a sane man, in full control of his actions, who simply strove to avoid detection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19920215&amp;id=goZRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wRIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5809,4020474 ''Milwaukee Sentinel'' Feb. 15, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; McCann argued that the act of murder was committed in hostility, anger, resentment, frustration, or hatred, and that the 15 victims for whose murder he was tried "died merely to afford Dahmer a period of sexual pleasure." McCann further argued that by pleading guilty but insane to the charges, Dahmer was seeking to escape responsibility for his crimes.

On February 15, the court reconvened to hear the verdict: Dahmer was ruled to be sane and not suffering from a mental disorder at the time of each of the 15 murders for which he was tried,&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 272"&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in each count, two of the 12 jurors signified their [[dissent]].&lt;ref name="Masters 1993 272"/&gt; On the first two counts, Dahmer was sentenced to life imprisonment plus ten years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,975527,00.html "Guilty!"], ''Time'' magazine, May 18, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; with the remaining 13 counts carrying a [[mandate (criminal law)|mandatory]] sentence of life imprisonment plus 70 years. The death penalty was not an option for Judge Gram to consider at the penalty phase as the State of Wisconsin had abolished capital punishment in 1853.&lt;ref name="Bardsley-21" /&gt;

Upon hearing of Jeffrey's sentencing, his father Lionel and stepmother Shari requested to be allowed a ten-minute private meeting with their son before he was transferred to the [[Columbia Correctional Institution (Wisconsin)|Columbia Correctional Institution]] in [[Portage, Wisconsin|Portage]] to begin his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; This request was granted and the trio exchanged hugs and well-wishes before Dahmer was escorted away to begin his sentence.

Three months after his conviction for 15 murders in Milwaukee, Dahmer was [[extradition|extradited]] to Ohio to be tried for the murder of his first victim, Steven Hicks.{{sfn|Dahmer|1994|p=241}} In a court hearing lasting just 45 minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=M.

With Dahmer's consent, after one year in solitary confinement, he was transferred to a less secure unit, where he was assigned a two-hour daily work detail cleaning the toilet block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abc7chicago.com/news/jeffrey-dahmers-killer-explains-why-he-did-it/688971/|title=Jeffrey Dahmer's Killer Explains Why He Did It|access-date=July 21, 2017|newspaper=ABC7 Chicago|date=April 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after completing his lengthy confessions in 1991, Dahmer had requested to Detective Patrick Murphy that he be given a copy of the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated215"/&gt; This request was granted and Dahmer gradually devoted himself to [[Christianity]] and became a [[born again (Christianity)|born-again Christian]]. On his father's urging, he also read [[creationist]] books from the [[Institute for Creation Research]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnf1j4hRbjU Lionel &amp; Shari Dahmer on Larry King Live (mentioned at around 37:35)]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1994, Dahmer was [[baptism|baptized]] by [[Roy Ratcliff]], a minister in the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]] and a graduate of [[Oklahoma Christian University]], in the prison whirlpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JYZhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TbUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4821,6803994 |title=Dahmer found religion, played pranks in prison |work=[[The Beaver County Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 28, 1994 |accessdate=December 5, 2013|via=Google News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bardsley-22" /&gt; Following his baptism, Ratcliff visited Dahmer on a weekly basis up until November 1994.

In July 1994, a fellow inmate, Osvaldo Durruthy, attempted to slash Dahmer's throat with a razor embedded in a toothbrush as Dahmer returned to his cell from Roy Ratcliff's weekly church service conducted in the prison chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/390410/ |title=Wisconsin Inmate Held in Slaying of Dahmer |newspaper=[[Deseret News]] |publisher=[[Deseret News Publishing Company]]|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 29, 1994 |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer received superficial wounds but was not seriously hurt in this incident. According to Dahmer's family, he had long been ready to die, and accepted any punishment which he might endure in prison. In addition to his father and stepmother retaining regular contact, Dahmer's mother, Joyce, retained regular contact with her son (although prior to his arrest, the two had not seen each other since Christmas 1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce Dahmer related that in her weekly phone calls, whenever she expressed concerns for her son's physical well-being, Dahmer responded with comments to the effect of: "It doesn't matter, Mom.

===Death===
On the morning of November 28, 1994, Dahmer left his cell to conduct his assigned work detail. Accompanying him were two fellow inmates: [[Jesse Anderson]] and [[Christopher Scarver]].

In this renewed account of events, Scarver claimed that the two had laughed at him when he had turned around in response before Dahmer and Anderson each walked to separate rooms to begin their cleaning duty, with Scarver following Dahmer toward the staff locker room.

Scarver alleges that immediately before murdering Dahmer, he had cornered him, presented a newspaper article detailing Dahmer's crimes, and demanded that Dahmer answer whether the account was true.&lt;ref name="NYP" /&gt; Scarver further alleged he had been revolted by Dahmer's crimes and that Dahmer had been openly unrepentant; that Dahmer taunted prison employees and fellow inmates by shaping his prison food into imitations of severed limbs, complete with ketchup to simulate blood spattering; and that prison staff, knowing of Scarver's hatred for Dahmer, had deliberately left the two men unsupervised so that he could kill him.&lt;ref name="NYP"&gt;{{cite news|first1=Jamie|last1=Schram|title=Why I killed Jeffrey Dahmer|url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/28/meet-the-prisoner-who-murdered-killer-cannibal-jeffrey-dahmer/|accessdate=April 29, 2015|newspaper=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corp.]]|location=New York City|date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Scarver stated that Dahmer was so disliked by fellow inmates that he required a personal escort of at least one [[prison guard|guard]] whenever he was out of his cell to prevent inmates from attacking him.

Dahmer's [[estate (law)|estate]] was awarded to the families of 11 of his victims who had sued for damages.

==Known murder victims==
Jeffrey Dahmer is known to have killed 17 young men between 1978 and 1991. Of these victims, 12 were killed in his North 25th Street apartment. Three further victims were murdered and dismembered at his grandmother's West Allis residence, with his first and second victims being murdered at his parents' home in Bath, Ohio, and at the Ambassador Hotel in Wisconsin respectively. A total of 14 of Dahmer's victims were from various ethnic minority backgrounds, with nine victims being black. Dahmer was adamant that the race of his victims was incidental to him and that it was the body form of a potential victim that attracted his attention.&lt;ref name="Mind p. 36"/&gt;{{refn|group=n|Despite Dahmer's insistence the race of his victims was incidental to him, some theorize the majority of his murders may have held a racial motive.&lt;ref&gt;''Erasing Racism: The Survival of the American Nation'' {{ISBN|978-1-615-92527-8}} p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Twentieth-Century Murder'' {{ISBN|978-1-858-91390-2}} p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, his victim selection may have simply been a result of his living in an ethnically mixed area, and the [[demography|demographics]] of the districts of Milwaukee and Chicago where he typically selected his victims.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=127}}}}

Most of Dahmer's victims were killed by strangulation after being drugged with sedatives, although his first victim was killed by a combination of bludgeoning and strangulation and his second victim was battered to death, with one further victim killed in 1990, Ernest Miller, dying of a combination of [[acute stress reaction|shock]] and blood loss due to his carotid artery being cut.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Many of Dahmer's victims killed in 1991 had holes bored into their skulls through which Dahmer injected hydrochloric acid or, later, boiling water, directly into the brain&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|pp=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to induce a permanent, submissive, unresistant state. On at least three occasions, this proved fatal although on none of these occasions was this Dahmer's intention.&lt;ref name="autogenerated188"/&gt;

===1978===
*'''June 18''': Steven Hicks, 18. Last seen hitchhiking to a rock concert in [[Chippewa Lake Park]] in Bath, Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; By Dahmer's admission, what caught his attention to Steven Hicks hitchhiking was the fact that the youth was bare-chested. He was bludgeoned with a dumbbell and strangled to death with this instrument before being dismembered. Remains pulverized and scattered in woodland behind Dahmer's childhood home.

===1987===
*'''November 20''': Steven Tuomi, 25. Killed in a rented room at the Ambassador Hotel in Milwaukee. Dahmer claimed to have no memory of murdering Tuomi, yet stated he must have battered him to death in a drunken stupor. His body was dismembered in the basement of Dahmer's grandmother's house and the remains discarded in the trash. No remains were ever found.

===1988===
*'''January 16''': James Doxtator, 14. Met Dahmer outside a gay bar in Wisconsin. Doxtator was lured to West Allis on the pretext of earning $50 for posing for nude pictures. Dahmer strangled Doxtator and kept his body in the basement for a week before dismembering him and discarding the remains in the trash. No remains were ever found.
*'''March 24''': Richard Guerrero, 22. Drugged and strangled in Dahmer's bedroom at West Allis. Dahmer dismembered Guerrero's corpse in the basement, dissolved the flesh in acid and disposed of the bones in the trash. He bleached and retained the skull for several months before disposing of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; No remains were ever found.

===1989===
*'''March 25''': Anthony Sears, 24. Sears was the last victim to be drugged and strangled at Dahmer's grandmother's residence; he was also the first victim from whom Dahmer permanently retained any body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=az0pAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=yGUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5679,1156034/Sun |title=Journal.

===1990===
*'''May 20''': Raymond Smith, 32. The first victim to be killed at Dahmer's North 25th Street apartment. Smith was a male prostitute whom Dahmer encountered at a tavern. Dahmer gave Smith a drink laced with sleeping pills, then strangled him on his kitchen floor.&lt;ref name="autogenerated141"/&gt; His skull was spray-painted and retained.
*'''June 14''': Edward Smith, 27. A known acquaintance of Dahmer who was last seen in his company at a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Norris|1992|pp=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dahmer acidified Smith's skeleton; his skull was destroyed unintentionally when placed in the oven in an effort to remove moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; No remains were ever found.
*'''September 2''': Ernest Miller, 22. Miller was a dance student whom Dahmer encountered outside a bookstore. According to Dahmer, he was especially attracted to Miller's [[physical attractiveness|physique]]. He was killed by having his carotid artery severed before being dismembered in the bathtub, with Dahmer storing his entire skeleton in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet and his heart, biceps, and portions of his legs in the freezer for later consumption.
*'''September 24''': David Thomas, 22. Encountered Dahmer near the Grand Avenue Mall; he was lured to Dahmer's apartment on the promise of money for posing nude. Once a laced drink had rendered Thomas unconscious, Dahmer decided he "wasn't my type." Nonetheless, Dahmer strangled Thomas, taking Polaroid photos of the dismemberment process. No remains were ever found.&lt;ref name="autogenerated217"/&gt;

===1991===
*'''February 18''': Curtis Straughter, 17. Approached by Dahmer as he waited at a bus stop near Marquette University. Dahmer lured Straughter to his apartment, where the youth was drugged, and then handcuffed and strangled before being dismembered in the bathtub. His skull, hands, and genitals were retained.
*'''April 7''': Errol Lindsey, 19. The first victim upon whom Dahmer practiced what he later described to investigators as his "drilling technique," a procedure in which he drilled holes into the victim's skull, through which he injected hydrochloric acid into the brain. According to Dahmer, Lindsey awoke after this practice, after which he was again rendered unconscious with a drink laced with sedatives, then strangled to death. Dahmer flayed Lindsey's body and retained the skin for several weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His skull was found following Dahmer's arrest.
*'''May 24''': Tony Hughes, 31. Hughes was a [[deaf-mute]] whom Dahmer lured to his apartment upon the promise of posing nude for photographs. As Hughes was deaf, he and Dahmer communicated using handwritten notes. He was strangled and his body left on Dahmer's bedroom floor for three days before being dismembered, with Dahmer photographing the dismemberment process. His skull was retained and identified from dental records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Robert J. Dvorchak|author2=Lisa Holewa |title= Milwaukee Massacre: Jeffrey Dahmer and the Milwaukee Murders |year= 1992 |isbn= 978-0-7090-5003-2 |page= 178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''May 27''': Konerak Sinthasomphone, 14. The younger brother of the boy Dahmer had assaulted in 1988. Sinthasomphone was drugged and had hydrochloric acid injected into his brain before Dahmer left the youth unattended as he left the apartment to purchase beer. When he returned, he discovered Sinthasomphone naked and disoriented in the street, with three distressed young women attempting to assist him. When police arrived, Dahmer persuaded them he and Sinthasomphone were lovers and that the youth was simply intoxicated. When police left Sinthasomphone with Dahmer in his apartment, Dahmer again injected hydrochloric acid into Sinthasomphone's brain, and this proved fatal. His head was retained in the freezer and his body dismembered.
*'''June 30''': Matt Turner, 20. On June 30, Dahmer attended the [[Chicago Pride Parade]]. At a bus stop, he encountered a 20-year-old named Matt Turner and persuaded him to accompany him to Milwaukee to pose for a photo shoot. Turner was drugged, strangled, and then dismembered in the bathtub. His head and internal organs were put in the freezer and his torso subsequently placed in the 57-gallon drum Dahmer purchased on July 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''July 5''': Jeremiah Weinberger, 23. Met Dahmer at a gay bar in Chicago and agreed to accompany him to Milwaukee for the weekend. Dahmer drilled through Weinberger's skull and injected boiling water into the cavity. He later recalled Weinberger's death to be exceptional, as he was the only victim who died with his eyes open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberger's decapitated body was kept in the bathtub for a week before being dismembered; his torso was placed in the 57-gallon drum.
*'''July 15''': Oliver Lacy, 24. A bodybuilding enthusiast whom Dahmer enticed to his apartment on the promise of money for posing for photographs. Lacy was drugged and strangled with a leather strap before being decapitated, with his head and heart being placed in the refrigerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Masters|1993|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His skeleton was retained to adorn one side of the private shrine of skulls and skeletons Dahmer was in the process of creating when arrested one week later.
*'''July 19''': Joseph Bradehoft, 25. Dahmer's last victim. Bradehoft was a father of three children from [[Minnesota]] who was looking for work in Milwaukee at the time of his murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19910726&amp;id=3jcdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NCwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4914,2602947 |title=Milwaukee Journal Jul. 26, 1991 |publisher=Google News |date=July 26, 1991 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was left on Dahmer's bed for two days following his murder before, on July 21, being decapitated.

'''The Life Cube Project''' is a community interactive art installation based upon the creator's idea that if you write something down, it is far more likely to happen. The Life Cube installation encourages members of the community and the general public to decorate it with inspirational writing, [[painting]]s, [[drawing]]s, [[mural]]s, and [[tapestry|tapestries]] for all its visitors to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalystcreativ.com/creativweek-march-2014-scott-cohen-the-life-cube-project/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109172409/http://catalystcreativ.com/creativweek-march-2014-scott-cohen-the-life-cube-project/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through four iterations at the annual Burning Man festival in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015; thousands of participants touched, climbed, inscribed, painted, and added their personal visions to the Life Cube. In 2014, the Life Cube Project made its way out of Burning Man and into its first major city in the United States as experiential and [[interactive art]].

==History of the Life Cube at Burning Man==
Over the course of three years, and returning as an Honorarium project in 2015, the Artist and his project team designed, built, and burned Life Cubes at [[Burning Man]]. The first Life Cube, an eight-foot square, was planned in 2010 and erected in 2011, and the artist was motivated to build another version of the Life Cube the following year. In 2012, its dimensions expanded to sixteen feet, enhanced by writable surfaces for greater interactivity and a more creative and graphic external skin. The third Cube came together in 2013. It featured a more complex and compelling multi-level architectural design with a pillared facade, more surfaces for writing and drawing, a tapestry wall, colored strobes and spotlights, and giant painted murals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2013/nov/20/joe-downtown-why-giant-burning-cube-can-change-you/&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Life Cube at Downtown Las Vegas==
In 2013, artist Scott Cohen was invited by the Downtown Project to develop the Life Cube Project for [[Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ignitechannel.com/artist-interview-scott-cohen-life-cube-project/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109184755/https://ignitechannel.com/artist-interview-scott-cohen-life-cube-project/ |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, a Life Cube was constructed on an entire city block in the East Fremont district of downtown Las Vegas. Open to the public 24/7,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/as-we-see-it/2014/feb/05/burning-man-inspired-life-cube-downtown-las-vegas/&lt;/ref&gt; local artists and members of the community painted all of its surfaces. The Life Cube was covered in constantly evolving and overlapping murals, hosting handwritten and painted messages from its visitors who wrote their personal hopes and dreams on "wish-stick" postcards and dropped them inside.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2014/feb/04/burn-downtowns-life-cube-inviting-canvas-artists/&lt;/ref&gt; Locally owned shops, bars, and restaurants joined with the Gay and Lesbian Community Center, churches, and Las Vegas’ City Hall in the project’s goal-setting theme to their constituencies through the satellite cube program.&lt;ref&gt;http://virtual-rebel.com/2014/03/17/life-cube-set-to-burn-in-downtown-festival/&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of March 21, the Cube burned in a ceremony involving thousands of participants and viewers.

The Life Cube returned to downtown Las Vegas in March 2016 and burned on April 2, 2016 in yet another celebration.

==Other Installations==
In 2015, a non-burning metal and glass Life Cube was featured at the Reno Sculpture Fest. The 12’ sculpture included murals, Tapestry Walls, and art and wishes contributed by 1,000s of schoolchildren with outreach to prison inmates, recovering addicts, and challenged youth. Unlike previous Cubes, where "Wish-Stick" postcards were placed inside and burned, this Cube featured a Wish-Tag Wall, where participants wrote on colorful tags tied to the Cube for others to read.

The Life Cube was also featured in Yerington, NV in 2015 for a non-burning installation created specifically for the Mason Valley Boys and Girls Club. This installation included a Tapestry Wall consisting of 1,500 8′ by 8′ canvas panels and a Wish-Tag Wall created by students, teachers, staff, and volunteers from nine middle schools and high schools in the area. During this installation, artist Scott Cohen was also invited to speak at the Youth of the Year banquet &lt;ref&gt;http://www.rgj.com/story/news/local/mason-valley/2016/01/20/artist-speak-youth-year-banquet/79080302/?hootPostID=86e7c732a3c0ca201c3fcfd53d7758b1&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage students to follow their hopes, wishes, and dreams.

In October 2016, the Life Cube Project was featured in its first New York installation at the Riverdale School &lt;ref&gt;http://www.riverdale.edu/page.cfm?p=917&amp;newsid=369&amp;ncat=7,11,10,6,8,1,2,5,4,3&lt;/ref&gt; in Bronx, NY. The 12' Cube remained on Jones Lawn for over a week inviting students, parents, faculty, and other visitors to paint, draw, write, and collaborate. This Cube did not burn, but the evolving and inspiring art on the structure invited dozens of participants nonetheless.

The Life Cube Project was invited to El Paso, TX from October 6 - 8, 2017 for the 10th anniversary of the annual Chalk the Block arts festival, organized by the City of El Paso Museum and Cultural Affairs Department (MCAD). The artist, Scott Cohen, spent ten days leading up to the installation visiting over 20 local schools to talk to students about goal-setting and connecting art with community. He spoke to youth from military families at Fort Bliss as well as folks at Opportunity house, a local shelter. Following these artist talks and workshops, the 12' x 12' brushed metal and canvas Life Cube installation was erected on San Jacinto Square, in the heart of the Arts District of downtown El Paso, and was open to the general public for three days.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theprospectordaily.com/2017/10/09/chalk-the-block-celebrates-ten-years-with-largest-attendance/&lt;/ref&gt; The Life Cube for Chalk the Block El Paso included all the elements of its signature approach to connecting art and community: live-painting of murals by several local artists, Dream Tags, a Tapestry Wall featuring canvases created by thousands of El Paso students, and—of course—chalk.

==Satellite Cubes==
Designed and implemented expressly for the Las Vegas Life Cube Project, nearly one hundred four-foot cubes were distributed to various venues where they were decorated by local artists, teachers, and children of all ages in establishments and schools throughout the Valley.&lt;ref&gt;http://ccsd.net/district/news/schools/2014/mar/7/scott-es-among-schools-to-participate-in-life-cube-project&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite cubes were gathered and returned to the Life Cube site for the final burn, combining their accumulated wishes with those of the Life Cube.

==Burning the Life Cube==
The burn usually takes place as a closing ceremony for the Life Cube. The Las Vegas Cubes required the assistance and support of the [[Las Vegas Fire &amp; Rescue|Las Vegas Fire Department]], an expert burn master, a burn perimeter team, a plethora of municipal permits, event organizers, a traffic plan, engineering, fire safety and air quality reports, cleanup crews, and additional provisions for security, hygiene, and disposal.

Each wooden rod typically holds one string: a bass string attached to one rod and a standard acoustic guitar string attached to the other. This allows the player to pluck a one-string bass and a one-string guitar at the same time. Each of the two strings has its own electric pickup that feeds into an amplifier. Some variations contain multiple strings on the treble neck, similar to standard cigar box guitars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Johnny|title=Johnny Lowe|url=http://cigarboxguitars.com/community/musicians/johnny-lowe|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowebow was created with the one-man band in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Willmott|first1=Sherman|title=How Lowebow Can You Go|url=http://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis/commentary-how-lowebow-can-you-go/Content?oid=1123008|publisher=Memphis Flyer|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the '''Sears, Roebuck and Company Mail-Order Warehouse and Retail Store'''.

The first phase of the building, along Elliot Avenue and [[Lake Street (Minneapolis)|Lake Street]], was built in 1928.  It was expanded in 1929, 1964, and 1979, resulting in 1.2 million square feet (110,000 m²) of space. A central tower along Elliot Avenue rises 16 floors to 211 feet (64 m).
After Sears closed the site in 1994, it laid vacant as development proposals came and went.  The city of Minneapolis acquired the site in 2001 and sold the 1979 expansion portion in 2002 to be used by the neighboring [[Abbott Northwestern Hospital]] as a [[parking ramp]].  Two years later, [[Ryan Companies]] was given exclusive development rights to the site. The resulting plan divided the structure into a mixed-use site with about 300 residential units, plus office and retail space. In 2004, [[Allina Health]] (which owns Abbott Northwestern among other area hospitals) announced plans to move their corporate headquarters to the building, taking up most of the allotted office space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridgemedicalcenter.com/ahs/news.nsf/newspage/all_2_18_04] Allina Health selects Minneapolis for corporate headquarters&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of the residential space is known as the '''Chicago Lofts''' located on floors 9-16 and '''Midtown Exchange Apartments''' located on floors 2-8. The building also includes the '''Midtown Global Market''', which is home to a variety of small independently owned restaurants, cafes, and specialty grocers, and hosts community programs including music, dance, and children's activities. A prototype [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton Hotel]] was built in the former Sears parking lot. The building and hotel have direct access to the [[Midtown Greenway]].

==Other buildings==
Midtown Exchange has a sister building called the [[Landmark Center (Boston)|Landmark Center]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Both were built in the 1920s and their designs are nearly identical. Both are former Sears warehouses which have since been renovated into commercial space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brunercott.com/library/landmark/landmark.htm Landmark Center, Kenmore Square, Boston&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other [[adaptive reuse|adaptively reused]] [[Sears]] warehouses include those in [[Ponce City Market|Atlanta]] (1925), [[Sears, Roebuck and Company Complex|Chicago]] (1906), [[Southside on Lamar|Dallas]] (1910), [[Sears, Roebuck and Company Warehouse Building (North Kansas City, Missouri)|North Kansas City]] (1913), and [[Starbucks Center|Seattle]] (1912). Similar sites under construction include the 1927 [[Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company Mail Order Building (Los Angeles, California)|Sears Mail Order Building]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and the [[Crosstown Concourse]] (1927) in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].

Similar Sears warehouses existed in Philadelphia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Altmann|first1=Nicole|title=Philadelphia’s Sears Tower|url=http://www.phillyhistory.org/blog/index.php/2014/08/philadelphias-sears-tower/|website=PhillyHistory|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1919) and [[Kansas City]] (1925) but were demolished in 1994 and 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20537">'''Modularity of mind''' is the notion that a [[mind]] may, at least in part, be composed of innate neural structures or modules which have distinct established [[evolution]]arily developed functions. Somewhat different definitions of "module" have been proposed by different authors.

==Early investigations==
Historically, questions regarding the ''functional architecture'' of the mind have been divided into two different theories of the nature of the faculties. The first can be characterized as a horizontal view because it refers to mental processes as if they are interactions between faculties such as memory, imagination, judgement, and perception, which are not [[domain specificity|domain specific]] (e.g., a judgement remains a judgement whether it refers to a perceptual experience or to the conceptualization/comprehension process). The second can be characterized as a vertical view because it claims that the mental faculties are differentiated on the basis of domain specificity, are genetically determined, are associated with distinct neurological structures, and are computationally autonomous.

The vertical vision goes back to the 19th century movement called [[phrenology]] and its founder [[Franz Joseph Gall]], who claimed that the individual mental faculties could be associated precisely, in a sort of one-to-one correspondence, with specific physical areas of the brain. Hence, someone's level of intelligence, for example, could be literally "read off" from the size of a particular bump on his posterior parietal lobe. This simplistic view of modularity has been disproven over the course of the last century.

==Fodor's ''Modularity of Mind''==
In the 1980s, however, [[Jerry Fodor]] revived the idea of the modularity of mind, although without the notion of precise physical localizability. Drawing from [[Noam Chomsky]]'s idea of the [[language acquisition device]] and other work in [[linguistics]] as well as from the [[philosophy of mind]] and the implications of [[optical illusion]]s, he became a major proponent of the idea with the 1983 publication of ''Modularity of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry A. (1983). ''Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fodor, a module falls somewhere between the behaviorist and cognitivist views of lower-level processes.

[[Behaviorism|Behaviorists]] tried to replace the mind with reflexes which Fodor describes as encapsulated (cognitively impenetrable or unaffected by other cognitive domains) and non-inferential (straight pathways with no information added). Low level processes are unlike reflexes in that they are inferential. This can be demonstrated by [[argument from poverty of the stimulus|poverty of the stimulus]] arguments in which the proximate stimulus, that which is initially received by the brain (such as the 2D image received by the retina), cannot account for the resulting output (for example, our 3D perception of the world), thus necessitating some form of computation.

In contrast, [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] saw lower level processes as continuous with higher level processes, being inferential and cognitively penetrable (influenced by other cognitive domains, such as beliefs). The latter has been shown to be untrue in some cases, such as with many visual illusions (ex. [[Müller-Lyer illusion]]), which can persist despite a person's awareness of their existence. This is taken to indicate that other domains, including one's beliefs, cannot influence such processes.

Fodor arrives at the conclusion that such processes are inferential like higher order processes and encapsulated in the same sense as reflexes.

Although he argued for the modularity of "lower level" cognitive processes in ''Modularity of Mind'' he also argued that higher level cognitive processes are not modular since they have dissimilar properties. ''The Mind Doesn't Work That Way'', a reaction to [[Steven Pinker]]'s ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', is devoted to this subject.

Fodor (1983) states that modular systems must—at least to "some interesting extent"—fulfill certain properties:
# Domain specificity: modules only operate on certain kinds of inputs—they are specialised
# Informational encapsulation: modules need not refer to other psychological systems in order to operate
# Obligatory firing: modules process in a mandatory manner
# Fast speed: probably due to the fact that they are encapsulated (thereby needing only to consult a restricted database) and mandatory (time need not be wasted in determining whether or not to process incoming input)
# Shallow outputs: the output of modules is very simple
# Limited accessibility
# Characteristic [[ontogeny]]: there is a regularity of development
# Fixed neural architecture.

Pylyshyn (1999) has argued that while these properties tend to occur with modules, one—information encapsulation—stands out as being the real signature of a module; that is the encapsulation of the processes inside the module from both cognitive influence and from cognitive access.&lt;ref&gt;Pylyshyn, Z.W. (1999). Is vision continuous with cognition? The case for cognitive impenetrability of visual perception. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 22(3), 341-423. [http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ftp/pub/papers/bbs1999_reprint.pdf Full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511184911/http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/ftp/pub/papers/bbs1999_reprint.pdf |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example is that conscious awareness of the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]] being an illusion does not correct visual processing.&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology and massive modularity==
Other perspectives on modularity come from [[evolutionary psychology]], particularly from the work of [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]]. This perspective suggests that modules are units of mental processing that evolved in response to selection pressures. On this view, much modern human psychological activity is rooted in adaptations that occurred earlier in [[human evolution]], when [[natural selection]] was forming the modern human species.

Evolutionary psychologists propose that the mind is made up of genetically influenced and domain-specific&lt;ref&gt;Cosmides, L. &amp; Tooby, J. (1994). Origins of Domain Specificity: The Evolution of Functional Organization. In L.A. Hirschfeld and S.A. Gelmen, eds., Mapping the Mind: Domain Specificity in Cognition and Culture. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Reprinted in R. Cummins and D.D. Cummins, eds., Minds, Brains, and Computers. Oxford: Blackwell, 2000, 523-543.&lt;/ref&gt; mental algorithms or computational modules, designed to solve specific evolutionary problems of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmides, L., &amp; Tooby, J. (1992). Cognitive Adaptations for Social Exchange. In Barkow, Cosmides, and Tooby 1992, 163-228.&lt;/ref&gt; Cosmides and Tooby also state in a brief "primer" on their website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/primer.html |title=Evolutionary Psychology Primer by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby |publisher=Psych.ucsb.edu |date=1997-01-13 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "…the brain is a physical system. It functions like a computer," "…the brain’s function is to process information," "different neural circuits are specialized for solving different adaptive problems," and "our modern skulls house a stone age mind."

The definition of ''module'' has caused confusion and dispute. J. A. Fodor initially  defined module as "functionally specialized cognitive systems" that have nine features but not necessarily all at the same time. In his views modules can be found in peripheral  processing such as low-level visual processing but not in central processing. Later he  narrowed the two essential features to ''domain-specificity'' and ''information  encapsulation''. Frankenhuis and Ploeger&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt; write that domain-specificity means that "a given cognitive mechanism accepts, or is specialized to operate on, only a specific class of information". Information encapsulation  means that information processing in the module cannot be affected by information in the  rest of the brain. One example is that being aware that a certain optical illusion, caused by low  level processing, is false does not prevent the illusion from persisting.&lt;ref name=FP2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Frankenhuis | first1 = W. E. | last2 = Ploeger | first2 = A. | doi = 10.1080/09515080701665904 | title = Evolutionary Psychology Versus Fodor: Arguments for and Against the Massive Modularity Hypothesis | journal = Philosophical Psychology | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 687 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary psychologists instead usually define modules as functionally specialized  cognitive systems that are domain-specific and may also contain innate knowledge about the  class of information processed. Modules can be found also for central processing. This  theory is sometimes referred to as ''massive modularity.''&lt;ref name=FP2007/&gt;

A 2010 review by evolutionary psychologists Confer et al. suggested that domain general theories, such as for "rationality," has several problems: 1. Evolutionary  theories using the idea of numerous  domain-specific adaptions have produced testable predictions that have been empirically  confirmed; the theory of domain-general rational thought has produced no such predictions  or confirmations. 2. The rapidity of responses such as jealousy due to infidelity indicates  a domain-specific dedicated module rather than a general, deliberate, rational calculation  of consequences. 3. Reactions may occur instinctively (consistent with innate knowledge)  even if a person has not learned such knowledge. One example being that in the ancestral  environment it is unlikely that males during development learn that infidelity (usually  secret) may cause paternal uncertainty (from observing the phenotypes of children born many  months later and making a statistical conclusion from the phenotype dissimilarity to the cuckolded fathers).&lt;ref name=AmPs2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Confer | first1 = J.

Clune et al. (2013) have argued that computer simulations of the evolution of neural nets suggest that modularity evolves because, compared to non-modular networks, connection costs are lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Clune |first1= Jeff |last2= Mouret |first2= Jean-Baptiste |last3= Lipson |first3= Hod |year= 2013 |title= The evolutionary origins of modularity |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume= 280 |issue= 1755 |pages= |publisher= |doi= 10.1098/rspb.2012.2863 |arxiv= 1207.2743|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups of critics, including psychologists working within evolutionary frameworks,&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"&gt;Panksepp, J. &amp; Panksepp, J. (2000). [http://www.flyfishingdevon.co.uk/salmon/year3/psy364criticisms-evolutionary-psychology/panksepp_seven_sins.pdf The Seven Sins of Evolutionary Psychology. Evolution and Cognition], 6:2, 108-131.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the massively modular theory of mind does little to explain adaptive psychological traits. Proponents of other models of the mind argue that the [[computational theory of mind]] is no better at explaining human behavior than a theory with mind entirely a product of the environment. Even within evolutionary psychology there is discussion about the degree of modularity, either as a few generalist modules or as many highly specific modules.&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buller, David J. and Valerie Gray Hardcastle (2005) Chapter 4. "Modularity", in Buller, David J. The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology. The MIT Press. pp. 127 - 201&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics suggest that there is little empirical support in favor of the domain-specific theory beyond performance on the [[Wason selection task]], a task critics state is too limited in scope to test all relevant aspects of reasoning.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Davies |first1= Paul Sheldon |last2= Fetzer |first2= James H. |last3= Foster |first3= Thomas R. |year= 1995 |title= Logical reasoning and domain specificity |journal= [[Biology and Philosophy]] |volume= 10 |issue= 1 |pages= 1&amp;ndash;37 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/BF00851985 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= O'Brien |first1= David |authorlink1= |last2= Manfrinati |first2= Angela |authorlink2= |editor1-first= Mike |editor1-last= Oaksford |editor1-link= |editor2-last= Chater |editor2-first= Nick |title= Cognition and Conditionals: Probability and Logic in Human Thinking |url= |year= 2010 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-19-923329-8 |page= |pages= 39&amp;ndash;54 |chapter= The Mental Logic Theory of Conditional Propositions |chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=iQSDOqAvXIoC&amp;pg=PA47 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, critics argue that Cosmides and Tooby's conclusions contain several inferential errors and that the authors use untested evolutionary assumptions to eliminate rival reasoning theories.&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lloyd |first1= Elizabeth A. |last2= |first2= |year= 1999 |title= Evolutionary Psychology: The Burdens of Proof |journal= Biology and Philosophy |volume= 19 |issue= 2 |pages= 211–233 |publisher= |doi= 10.1023/A:1006638501739 |url= http://philpapers.org/archive/LLOEPT.pdf |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace (2010) observes that the evolutionary psychologists' definition of "mind" has been heavily influenced by [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] and/or [[information processing]] definitions of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. (2010). Getting Darwin Wrong: Why Evolutionary Psychology Won’t Work. Exeter, UK: Imprint Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics point out that these assumptions underlying evolutionary psychologists' hypotheses are controversial and have been contested by some psychologists, philosophers, and neuroscientists. For example, [[Jaak Panksepp]], an affective neuroscientist, point to the "remarkable degree of neocortical plasticity within the human brain, especially during development" and states that "the developmental interactions among ancient special-purpose circuits and more recent general-purpose brain mechanisms can generate many of the "modularized" human abilities that evolutionary psychology has entertained."&lt;ref name="Panksepp, J. 2000"/&gt;

Philosopher David Buller agrees with the general argument that the human mind has evolved over time but disagrees with the specific claims evolutionary psychologists make. He has argued that the contention that the mind consists of thousands of modules, including sexually dimorphic jealousy and parental investment modules, are unsupported by the available [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2= |first2= |year= 2005 |title= Evolutionary psychology: the emperor's new paradigm |journal= Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume= 9 |issue= 6 |pages= 277–283 |publisher= |doi= 10.1016/j.tics.2005.04.003|url= http://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/10843/13182/1/BullerTiCS%20Reprint.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013 |pmid=15925806}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has suggested that the "modules" result from the brain's developmental [[Neuroplasticity|plasticity]] and that they are adaptive responses to local conditions, not past evolutionary environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2= Hardcastle |first2= Valerie |year= 2000 |title= Evolutionary Psychology, Meet Developmental Neurobiology: Against Promiscuous Modularity |journal= Brain and Mind |volume= 1 |issue= 3 |pages= 307&amp;ndash;325 |publisher= |doi= 10.1023/A:1011573226794 |url= http://commons.lib.niu.edu/bitstream/10843/13181/1/evolutionarypsych.pdf |accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Buller has also stated that even if massive modularity is false this does not necessarily have broad implications for evolutionary psychology. Evolution may create innate motives even without innate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Buller |first1= David J. |last2=  |first2=  |year= 2005 |title= Get Over: Massive Modularity |journal= Biology &amp; Philosophy |volume= 20 |issue= 4 |pages= 881–891 |publisher=  |doi= 10.1007/s10539-004-1602-3 |url= http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/publications/_pdf/over.pdf |accessdate= March 23, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150317231528/http://www.niu.edu/phil/~buller/publications/_pdf/over.pdf |archive-date= March 17, 2015 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to modular mental structure, some theories posit [[Domain-general learning|domain-general processing]], in which mental activity is distributed across the brain and cannot be decomposed, even abstractly, into independent units. A staunch defender of this view is William Uttal, who argues in ''The New Phrenology'' (2003) that there are serious philosophical, theoretical, and methodological problems with the entire enterprise of trying to localise cognitive processes in the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Uttal, William R. (2003). ''The New Phrenology: The Limits of Localizing Cognitive Processes in the Brain.'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this argument is that a successful [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of mental processes has yet to be developed.

Merlin Donald argues that over evolutionary time the mind has gained adaptive advantage from being a general problem solver.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, ''A Mind So Rare: The Evolution of Human Consciousness'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20060620060057/http://psyc.queensu.ca/faculty/donald/book/mindsorare2.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; The mind, as described by Donald, includes module-like "central" mechanisms, in addition to more recently evolved "domain-general" mechanisms.

==Neurobiological approach to consciousness==
A science of [[consciousness]] must explain the exact relationship between subjective mental states and brain states, the nature of the relationship between the conscious mind and the electro-chemical interactions in the body ([[mind–body problem]]). Progress in [[neuropsychology]] and [[neurophilosophy]] has come from focusing on the body rather than the mind. In this context the neuronal correlates of consciousness may be viewed as its causes, and [[consciousness]] may be thought of as a state-dependent property of some undefined [[complex systems|complex]], adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Squire2008|Squire 2008]], p. 1223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovering and characterizing neural correlates does not offer a theory of consciousness that can explain how particular systems experience anything at all, or how and why they are associated with consciousness, the so-called [[hard problem of consciousness]],&lt;ref name="Kandel2007p382"&gt;[[#Kandel2007|Kandel 2007]], p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; but understanding the NCC may be a step toward such a theory. Most neurobiologists assume that the variables giving rise to consciousness are to be found at the neuronal level, governed by classical physics, though a few scholars have proposed theories of [[quantum consciousness]] based on [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quantum physics in neuroscience and psychology: A neurophysiological model of mind/brain interaction |author1=Jeffrey M. Schwartz |author2=Henry P. Stapp |author3=Mario Beauregard |url=http://www-physics.lbl.gov/~stapp/PTB6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is great apparent redundancy and parallelism in neural networks so, while activity in one group of neurons may correlate with a percept in one case, a different population might mediate a related percept if the former population is lost or inactivated. It may be that every phenomenal, subjective state has a neural correlate. Where the NCC can be induced artificially the subject will experience the associated percept, while perturbing or inactivating the region of correlation for a specific percept will affect the percept or cause it to disappear, giving a cause-effect relationship from the neural region to the nature of the percept.

What characterizes the NCC? What are the commonalities between the NCC for seeing and for hearing? Will the NCC involve all the [[Pyramidal cell|pyramidal neurons]] in the cortex at any given point in time? Or only a subset of long-range projection cells in the frontal lobes that project to the sensory cortices in the back? Neurons that fire in a rhythmic manner? Neurons that fire in a [[neural oscillations|synchronous manner]]? These are some of the proposals that have been advanced over the years.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Chalmers1998|Chalmers 1998]], available online.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools (e.g., [[#Adamantidis2007|Adamantidis et al. 2007]]) depends on the simultaneous development of appropriate behavioral assays and model organisms amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. It is the combination of such fine-grained neuronal analysis in animals with ever more sensitive psychophysical and brain imaging techniques in humans, complemented by the development of a robust theoretical predictive framework, that will hopefully lead to a rational understanding of consciousness, one of the central mysteries of life.

==Level of arousal and content of consciousness==
There are two common but distinct dimensions of the term ''consciousness'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zeman2001|Zeman 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt; one involving ''arousal'' and ''states of consciousness'' and the other involving ''content of consciousness'' and ''conscious states''. To be conscious ''of'' anything the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called ''vigilance''), whether in wakefulness or [[REM sleep]], vividly experienced in dreams although usually not remembered. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a [[circadian]] rhythm but may be influenced by lack of sleep, drugs and alcohol, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude that triggers some criterion reaction (for instance, the sound level necessary to evoke an eye movement or a head turn toward the sound source). Clinicians use scoring systems such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] to assess the level of arousal in patients.

High arousal states are associated with conscious states that have specific content, seeing, hearing, remembering, planning or fantasizing about something. Different levels or states of consciousness are associated with different kinds of conscious experiences. The "awake" state is quite different from the "dreaming" state (for instance, the latter has little or no self-reflection) and from the state of deep sleep. In all three cases the basic physiology of the brain is affected, as it also is in ''altered states of consciousness'', for instance after taking drugs or during meditation when conscious perception and insight may be enhanced compared to the normal waking state.

Clinicians talk about ''impaired states of consciousness'' as in "the [[coma|comatose state]]", "the [[persistent vegetative state]]" (PVS), and "the [[minimally conscious state]]" (MCS). Here, "state" refers to different "amounts" of external/physical consciousness, from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and general anesthesia, to a fluctuating and limited form of conscious sensation in a minimally conscious state such as sleep walking or during a complex partial [[epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schiff2004|Schiff 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; The repertoire of conscious states or experiences accessible to a patient in a minimally conscious state is comparatively limited. In brain death there is no arousal, but it is unknown whether the subjectivity of experience has been interrupted, rather than its observable link with the organism.

The potential ''richness of conscious experience'' appears to increase from deep sleep to drowsiness to full wakefulness, as might be quantified using notions from complexity theory that incorporate both the dimensionality as well as the granularity of conscious experience to give an [[Integrated information theory|integrated-information-theoretical account]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tononi2016|Tononi et al. 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; As behavioral arousal increases so does the range and complexity of possible behavior. Yet in REM sleep there is a characteristic [[atonia]], low motor arousal and the person is difficult to wake up, but there is still high metabolic and electric brain activity and vivid perception.

Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]] and [[pons]] must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus]], [[claustrum]] and the [[basal ganglia]].

==The neuronal basis of perception==
The possibility of precisely manipulating visual percepts in time and space has made [[visual perception|vision]] a preferred modality in the quest for the NCC. Psychologists have perfected a number of techniques – [[Visual masking|masking]], [[binocular rivalry]], [[flash suppression|continuous flash suppression]], [[motion induced blindness]], [[change blindness]], [[inattentional blindness]] – in which the seemingly simple and unambiguous relationship between a physical stimulus in the world and its associated percept in the privacy of the subject's mind is disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#KimBlake2004|Kim and Blake 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; In particular a stimulus can be perceptually suppressed for seconds or even minutes at a time: the image is projected into one of the observer's eyes but is invisible, not seen. In this manner the neural mechanisms that respond to the subjective percept rather than the physical stimulus can be isolated, permitting visual consciousness to be tracked in the brain. In a ''perceptual [[illusion]]'', the physical stimulus remains fixed while the percept fluctuates. The best known example is the ''[[Necker cube]]'' whose 12 lines can be perceived in one of two different ways in depth.

[[File:NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness3.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Necker Cube: The left line drawing can be perceived in one of two distinct depth configurations shown on the right. Without any other cue, the visual system flips back and forth between these two interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 16.1 ''The Bistable Necker Cube'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A perceptual illusion that can be precisely controlled is ''[[binocular rivalry]]''. Here, a small image, e.g., a horizontal grating, is presented to the left eye, and another image, e.g., a vertical grating, is shown to the corresponding location in the right eye. In spite of the constant visual stimulus, observers consciously see the horizontal grating alternate every few seconds with the vertical one. The brain does not allow for the simultaneous perception of both images.

Logothetis and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;[[#Logothetis1998|Logothetis 1998]]&lt;/ref&gt; recorded a variety of visual cortical areas in awake macaque monkeys performing a binocular rivalry task. Macaque monkeys can be trained to report whether they see the left or the right image. The distribution of the switching times and the way in which changing the contrast in one eye affects these leaves little doubt that monkeys and humans experience the same basic phenomenon. In the primary visual cortex (V1) only a small fraction of cells weakly modulated their response as a function of the percept of the monkey while most cells responded to one or the other retinal stimulus with little regard to what the animal perceived at the time. But in a high-level cortical area such as the inferior temporal cortex along the [[ventral stream]] almost all neurons responded only to the perceptually dominant stimulus, so that a "face" cell only fired when the animal indicated that it saw the face and not the pattern presented to the other eye. This implies that NCC involve neurons active in the inferior temporal cortex: it is likely that specific reciprocal actions of neurons in the inferior temporal and parts of the prefrontal cortex are necessary.

A number of [[fMRI]] experiments that have exploited binocular rivalry and related illusions to identify the hemodynamic activity underlying visual consciousness in humans demonstrate quite conclusively that activity in the upper stages of the ventral pathway (e.g., the [[fusiform face area]] and the [[parahippocampal place area]]) as well as in early regions, including V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), follow the percept and not the retinal stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ReesFrith2007|Rees and Frith 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, a number of fMRI&lt;ref&gt;[[#HaynesRees2005|Haynes and Rees 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lee2007|Lee et al. 2007]]&lt;/ref&gt; and DTI experiments&lt;ref&gt;[[#ShimonoNiki2013|Shimono and Niki 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest V1 is necessary but not sufficient for visual consciousness.&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;[[#CrickKoch1995|Crick and Koch 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a related perceptual phenomenon, ''[[flash suppression]]'', the percept associated with an image projected into one eye is suppressed by flashing another image into the other eye while the original image remains. Its methodological advantage over binocular rivalry is that the timing of the perceptual transition is determined by an external trigger rather than by an internal event. The majority of cells in the inferior temporal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus of monkeys trained to report their percept during flash suppression follow the animal's percept: when the cell's preferred stimulus is perceived, the cell responds. If the picture is still present on the retina but is perceptually suppressed, the cell falls silent, even though primary visual cortex neurons fire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#LeopoldLogothetis1996|Leopold and Logothetis 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#SheinbergLogothetis1997|Sheinberg and Logothetis 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; Single-neuron recordings in the medial temporal lobe of epilepsy patients during flash suppression likewise demonstrate abolishment of response when the preferred stimulus is present but perceptually masked.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kreiman2002|Kreiman et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global disorders of consciousness==
Given the absence of any accepted criterion of the minimal neuronal correlates necessary for consciousness, the distinction between a persistently vegetative patient who shows regular sleep-wave transitions and may be able to move or smile, and a minimally conscious patient who can communicate (on occasion) in a meaningful manner (for instance, by differential eye movements) and who shows some signs of consciousness, is often difficult. In global anesthesia the patient should not experience psychological trauma but the level of arousal should be compatible with clinical exigencies.

[[File:NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Midline structures in the brainstem and thalamus necessary to regulate the level of brain arousal. Small, bilateral lesions in many of these nuclei cause a global loss of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]], Figure 5.1 ''The Cholinergic Enabling System'' p. 92. See Chapter 5, available on line.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Blood-oxygen-level-dependent [[fMRI]] have demonstrated normal patterns of brain activity in a patient in a vegetative state following a severe traumatic brain injury when asked to imagine playing tennis or visiting rooms in his/her house.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Owen2006|Owen et al. 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; Differential brain imaging of patients with such global disturbances of consciousness (including [[akinetic mutism]]) reveal that dysfunction in a widespread cortical network including medial and lateral prefrontal and parietal associative areas is associated with a global loss of awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Laureys2005|Laureys 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Impaired consciousness in [[epileptic]] seizures of the [[medial temporal lobe|temporal lobe]] was likewise accompanied by a decrease in cerebral blood flow in frontal and parietal association cortex and an increase in midline structures such as the [[thalamus|mediodorsal thalamus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blumenfeld2004|Blumenfeld et al. 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively local bilateral injuries to midline (paramedian) subcortical structures can also cause a complete loss of awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Koch2004|Koch 2004]],  p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; These structures therefore ''enable'' and control brain arousal (as determined by metabolic or electrical activity) and are necessary neural correlates. One such example is the heterogeneous collection of more than two dozen nuclei on each side of the upper brainstem (pons, midbrain and in the posterior hypothalamus), collectively referred to as the [[reticular activating system]] (RAS). Their axons project widely throughout the brain. These nuclei – three-dimensional collections of neurons with their own cyto-architecture and neurochemical identity – release distinct neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, noradrenaline/norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine and orexin/hypocretin to control the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain, mediating alternation between wakefulness and sleep as well as general level of behavioral and brain arousal. After such trauma, however, eventually the excitability of the thalamus and forebrain can recover and consciousness can return.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Villablanca2004|Villablanca 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; Another enabling factor for consciousness are the five or more [[intralaminar nuclei]] (ILN) of the thalamus. These receive input from many brainstem nuclei and project strongly, directly to the basal ganglia and, in a more distributed manner, into layer I of much of the neocortex. Comparatively small (1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or less) bilateral lesions in the thalamic ILN completely knock out all awareness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bogen1995|Bogen 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forward versus feedback projections==
Many actions in response to sensory inputs are rapid, transient, stereotyped, and unconscious.&lt;ref name="milner"&gt;[[#MilnerGoodale1995|Milner and Goodale 1995]]&lt;/ref&gt; They could be thought of as cortical reflexes and are characterized by rapid and somewhat stereotyped responses that can take the form of rather complex automated behavior as seen, e.g., in complex partial [[epileptic]] seizures. These automated responses, sometimes called ''zombie behaviors'',&lt;ref&gt;[[#KochCrick2001|Koch and Crick 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt; could be contrasted by a slower, all-purpose conscious mode that deals more slowly with broader, less stereotyped aspects of the sensory inputs (or a reflection of these, as in imagery) and takes time to decide on appropriate thoughts and responses. Without such a consciousness mode, a vast number of different zombie modes would be required to react to unusual events.

A feature that distinguishes humans from most animals is that we are not born with an extensive repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("[[physiological prematurity]]"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Beilock2002|Beilock et al. 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

From an evolutionary standpoint it clearly makes sense to have both automated behavioral programs that can be executed rapidly in a stereotyped and automated manner, and a slightly slower system that allows time for thinking and planning more complex behavior. This latter aspect may be one of the principal functions of consciousness. Other philosophers, however, have suggested that consciousness would not be necessary for any functional advantage in evolutionary processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| authors=[[Owen Flanagan]] and T. W. Polger |year=1995 |title=Zombies and the function of consciousness |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=2 |pages=313–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=David|title=Consciousness and its function|journal=Neuropsychologia|year=2008|volume=46|pages=829–840|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.11.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No one has given a causal explanation, they argue, of why it would not be possible for a functionally equivalent non-conscious organism (i.e., a [[philosophical zombie]]) to achieve the very same survival advantages as a conscious organism. If evolutionary processes are blind to the difference between function ''F'' being performed by conscious organism ''O'' and non-conscious organism ''O*'', it is unclear what adaptive advantage consciousness could provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Stevan Harnad]] |year=2002 |chapter= Turing indistinguishability and the Blind Watchmaker |editor=J. H. Fetzer |title=Consciousness Evolving |publisher=John Benjamins |url=http://cogprints.org/1615 |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, an exaptive explanation of consciousness has gained favor with some theorists that posit consciousness did not evolve as an adaptation but was an [[exaptation]] arising as a consequence of other developments such as increases in brain size or cortical rearrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3790330 | pmid=24109460 | doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00667 | volume=4 | title=The evolutionary and genetic origins of consciousness in the Cambrian Period over 500 million years ago. | year=2013 | journal=Front Psychol | pages=667 |vauthors=Feinberg TE, Mallatt J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consciousness in this sense has been compared to the blind spot in the retina where it is not an adaption of the retina, but instead just a by-product of the way the retinal axons were wired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zack ROBINSON |author2=Corey J. MALEY |author3=Gualtiero PICCININI | year = 2015 | title = Is Consciousness a Spandrel?. | url = | journal = Journal of the American Philosophical Association | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 365–383 | doi = 10.1017/apa.2014.10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several scholars including Pinker, Chomsky, Edelman, and Luria have indicated the importance of the emergence of human language as an important regulative mechanism of learning and memory in the context of the development of higher-order consciousness.

It seems possible that visual zombie modes in the cortex mainly use the [[Two Streams hypothesis#Dorsal stream|dorsal stream]] in the parietal region.&lt;ref name="milner"/&gt; However, parietal activity can affect consciousness by producing attentional effects on the ventral stream, at least under some circumstances. The conscious mode for vision depends largely on the early visual areas (beyond V1) and especially on the ventral stream.

Seemingly complex visual processing (such as detecting animals in natural, cluttered scenes) can be accomplished by the human cortex within 130–150 ms,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thorpe1996|Thorpe et al. 1996]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#VanRullenKoch2003|VanRullen and Koch 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt; far too brief for eye movements and conscious perception to occur. Furthermore, reflexes such as the [[oculovestibular reflex]] take place at even more rapid time-scales. It is quite plausible that such behaviors are mediated by a purely feed-forward moving wave of spiking activity that passes from the retina through V1, into V4, IT and prefrontal cortex, until it affects motorneurons in the spinal cord that control the finger press (as in a typical laboratory experiment). The hypothesis that the basic processing of information is feedforward is supported most directly by the short times (approx. 100 ms) required for a selective response to appear in IT cells.

Conversely, conscious perception is believed to require more sustained, reverberatory neural activity, most likely via global feedback from frontal regions of neocortex back to sensory cortical areas&lt;ref name= "Crick"/&gt; that builds up over time until it exceeds a critical threshold. At this point, the sustained neural activity rapidly propagates to parietal, prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortical regions, thalamus, claustrum and related structures that support short-term memory, multi-modality integration, planning, speech, and other processes intimately related to consciousness. Competition prevents more than one or a very small number of percepts to be simultaneously and actively represented. This is the core hypothesis of the [[global workspace theory]] of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Baars1988|Baars 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dehaene2003|Dehaene et al. 2003]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In brief, while rapid but transient neural activity in the thalamo-cortical system can mediate complex behavior without conscious sensation, it is surmised that consciousness requires sustained but well-organized neural activity dependent on long-range cortico-cortical feedback.

[[File:公民.jpg|thumb|right|Citizen insignia, handwriting of [[Sun Yatsen]]]]

The '''Chinese New Citizens' Movement''' ({{zh|s=中国新公民运动|t=中國新公民運動|p=Zhōngguó XīnGōngMín YùnDòng}}) is a collection of numerous civil rights activists in [[mainland China]] since 2010. It is promoted by the loosely organized civil rights group "Citizens" (successor to the [[Open Constitution Initiative]] ({{zh|s=公盟|p=gōngméng}})) with the '''New Citizens' Spirit''': "Free, Righteous, Loving". It is a major component of the civil society movement in mainland China since the beginning of the 21st century. The New Citizen's Movement has close ties to the [[weiquan movement]] (rights defending movement), but it has clearer and higher-level charter and pursuits. It is a political movement, which hopes to facilitate a peaceful transition of the country towards constitutionalism. It is also a social movement, hoping to facilitate a transition from a "servants' society" to a [[civil society]].

The name "New Citizens' Movement" was proposed by [[Xu Zhiyong]], a prominent legal scholar and civil rights lawyer, in his article "China's New Citizens' Movement" in May 2012.&lt;ref name="citizensmovement"&gt;{{cite web |author=Xu Zhiyong | title=China's New Citizens' Movement | date=May 29, 2012 | publisher= | url = http://xuzhiyong2012.blogspot.com/2012/11/blog-post_9281.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = | language = Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese authorities have always tried to monitor and suppress the New Citizens' Movement. Xu Zhiyong, founder of the movement, was arrested on July 16, 2013.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news | author=Chris Buckley | title=A Leading Chinese Human Rights Advocate Is Detained in Beijing | date=July 17, 2013 | publisher=NYTimes | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/world/asia/china-detains-a-leading-human-rights-advocate.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news | author=Calum MacLeod | title=China silences anti-corruption activists | date=July 30, 2013 | publisher=USA Today | url =https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/07/30/china-corruption-prison/2590301/ | work = | pages = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news | author=Jane Perlez | title=Jailed Chinese Rights Advocate Speaks Out in Video | date=Aug 8, 2013 | publisher=NYTimes | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/world/asia/imprisoned-chinese-rights-advocate-urges-defiance-in-video.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another prominent businessman and financial supporter of the movement, [[Wang Gongquan]], was arrested on Sep 13, 2013.&lt;ref name="nty-wgq"&gt;{{cite news | title=China Detains a Billionaire for Activism | date=2013-09-13 |publisher=NYTimes | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/14/world/asia/activist-chinese-billionaire-is-arrested.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Citizens' spirit and logo==

===New Citizens' Spirit===
[[File:自由公義愛.jpg|thumb|The "Free, Righteous, Loving" insignia]]

The New Citizens' Spirit was first established by Xu Zhiyong in his article "New Citizens' Spirit - Free, Righteous, Loving".&lt;ref name="blogspot01"&gt;{{cite web | first=Xu Zhiyong | script-title=zh:新公民精神——自由、公义、爱 | date=Jun 20, 2012 | publisher=Works of Xu Zhiyong | url =http://xuzhiyong2012.blogspot.com/2012/11/blog-post_6084.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = | language = Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Citizens' logo===

The New Citizens' logo is the word "公民" (citizen) handwritten by [[Sun Yat-sen]]. The characters are in white on a blue background. It is the common symbol of Chinese citizens' pursuit of freedom, [[democracy]], [[rule of law]] and [[constitutionalism]]. It is often used in combination with the five Chinese characters denoting the New Citizens' Spirit.

==Activism of the New Citizens' movement==

===Citizens' pledge===
In June 2010, a group of scholars, lawyers, journalists and activists, including [[Xu Zhiyong]], [[Teng Biao]], [[Wang Gongquan]], [[Li Xiongbin]], [[Li Fangping]], [[Xu Youyu]] and [[Zhang Shihe]] (Laohumiao), initiated an open letter "The Citizens' Pledge", calling for the awakening and improvement of Chinese citizens' civil rights awareness.&lt;ref name=chinageeks&gt;{{cite web | last=Custer | first=Charlie | title=Xu Zhiyong, et al: "The Chinese Citizens' Pledge" | date=20 June 2010 | publisher=ChinaGeeks | url=http://www.chinageeks.org/2010/06/xu-zhiyong-et-al-the-chinese-citizens-pledge/ | accessdate=26 March 2015 | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326100122/http://www.chinageeks.org/2010/06/xu-zhiyong-et-al-the-chinese-citizens-pledge/ | archivedate=26 March 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event is usually regarded as the start of the New Citizens' Movement (even though it was prior to the coinage of the term).

===Equal rights for education===
"Equal Rights for Education" is armed to reduce and eliminate the huge unfairness of the distribution of education resources in mainland China. One specific campaign is to abolish the [[Hukou system|hukou]] restriction in [[gaokao]] (college admission exam) for migrants' children in large cities. The campaign started with just four student-parent volunteers in 2010, and grew to more than 100,000 in 2012. Under the pressure, the Ministry of Education revised the gaokao policy for migrants' student children in August 2012. Subsequently, all provinces and cities except Beijing and Shanghai, removed or promised to remove the hukou constraint. This campaign was initiated by Wang Gongquan.

===Wealth disclosure (of government officials)===
"Wealth Disclosure" calls for the disclosure of the wealth of government officials in mainland China. There have been public demonstrations in many cities. The notable ones include a demonstration by Yuan Dong, Zhang Baocheng, Ma Xinli and Hou Xin in Beijing's Xidan Square on Mar 31, 2013, and a demonstration by [[Liu Ping (activist)|Liu Ping]], [[Wei Zhongping]], Li Sihua etc. in Xinyu, Jiangxi on Apr 23, 2013.

===Same-city dinner gathering===
"Same-City Dining" is the regular dinner gathering held on the last Saturday each month. In mainland China, netizens' dinner gathering has been around for many years. Around the end of 2011, after deliberations, it was proposed to set a fixed date (last Saturday of the month) so as to strengthen the coalitions of citizens. The dinner gatherings are self-organized, generally covering social issues, but the topic and format are not fixed. At 2013, the dinner gatherings take place in more than 30 cities, including overseas Chinese. Even though dinner gatherings are low-key and not illegal, they are still under pressure in several cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, Nanning and Changsha. The participants may be questioned, and sensitive persons are sometimes threatened or detained.

===Citizen Lookout===
"Citizen Lookout" is a project to provide support for the basic needs of families of prisoners of conscience. The reference level is RMB 50,000 per year. This project was proposed by Li Huaping. It is similar to the "Songfandang" by Routangseng and "Ai-Mo-Can-Help" project by [[Ai Weiwei]] and Mo Zhixu.

==Reaction of Chinese authorities==

Chinese authorities have frequently suppressed independent activism. In 2009, authorities disbanded Gongmeng (Open Constitution Initiative) alleging tax evasion.  Many Gongmeng members subsequently joined "Citizens" to continue civil rights activism.

From the end of 2012 to 2013, many citizens took to the streets in Shenzhen, Beijing, Jiangxi and other cities, demanding that Chinese government officials disclose their wealth, which led to several arrests. Between March 31 and April 17, 2013, authorities arrested 10 citizens: Yuan Dong, Zhang Baocheng, Ma Xinli, Hou Xin, Ding Jiaxi, Zhao Changqing, Sun Hanhui, Wang Yonghong, Li Wei and Qi Yueying. Also arrested in Beijing were Zhang Xiangzhong, Li Gang, Li Huanjun, Song Ze and Xu Zhiyong. Three Xinyu citizens, Liu Ping, Wei Zhongping, Li Sihua were arrested in Jiangxi on April 28, 2013. Five citizens, Yuan Fengchu (Yuan Bing), Yuan Xiaohua, Huang Wenxun, Chen Jianxiong (Chen Jinxin), and Li Yinli were arrested in Hubei on May 25.

The trial of Liu Ping, Wei Zhongping and Li Sihua began in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/chinese-citizens-rights-activist-wang-gongquan-is-formally-arrested/2013/10/21/888909ca-3a73-11e3-b0e7-716179a2c2c7_story.html In China, citizens rights activist Wang Gongquan is formally arrested] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' 21 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  They had been in detention since April.&lt;ref&gt;Fang Yang [http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/829676.shtml 3 stand trial in Jiangxi for illegal assembly] ''[[Global Times]]'' 4 December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The three were indicted on a charge of illegal assembly in July, with additional charges of "gathering a crowd to disrupt order in a public place" and "using an evil cult to undermine law enforcement" given to Liu Ping and Wei Zhongping in September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrichina.org/content/6973 Lawyers Call for Release of Three Asset Transparency Advocates, Challenge Legality of Trial Delay] ''[[Human Rights in China (organization)|Human Rights in China]]'' 15 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On Jul 16, 2013, after being under [[House arrest#People's Republic of China|house arrest]] for more than three months, Xu Zhiyong was detained for allegedly "amassing a crowd to disturb order in a public space". The arrest was covered in the news and drew great attention both domestically and internationally.&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes2" /&gt; On Aug 22, Dr Xu was formally charged.&lt;ref name="formalcharge"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chinese citizens movement leader arrested|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/chinese-citizens-movement-leader-arrested|newspaper=Associated Press|author=Gillian Wong|date=Aug 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Jul 18, Chuan-Zhi-Xing ("Transitions"), a Beijing-based NGO/thinktank was closed due to its involvement with civil rights research.

Dr Xu's arrest caused wide-scale protest. [[Mao Yushi]], Wang Gongquan, Xiaoshu, He Sanwei, Yang Zili published an open letter demanding the release of Dr Xu and other arrested citizens. More than 3000 people signed the open letter.

On Aug 8, Guo Feixiong, a main organizer of New Citizens' Movement in southern China, was arrested. On Aug 11, Li Huaping, a main organizer of New Citizens' Movement in eastern China, was arrested.

On Sep 13, Wang Gongquan was detained by Beijing police for "disturbing order in public space". On Oct 20, he was formally charged.&lt;ref name="nty-wgq" /&gt;

On January 26, 2014, the [[Beijing Number One Intermediate People's Court]] sentenced Xu Zhiyong to a four-year prison sentence. The conviction was for assembling crowds with the intent to disrupt public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303553204579344160684807586]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, Ding Jiaxi and Li Wei, of the New Citizens' Movement, were put on trial for 'disrupting public order'. Foreign diplomats attended, but were not admitted to the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rthk.hk/rthk/news/englishnews/news.htm?englishnews&amp;20140409&amp;56&amp;998265 Anti-corruption activists in the dock], RTHK, 9 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Judicial interpretation}}
In the context of United States law, '''originalism''' is a concept regarding the [[constitutional interpretation|interpretation]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] that asserts that all statements in the constitution must be interpreted based on the original understanding of the authors or the people at the time it was ratified. This concept views the Constitution as stable from the time of enactment, and that the meaning of its contents can be changed only by the steps set out in [[Article Five of the United States Constitution|Article Five]].&lt;ref name="Boyce"&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1435069 B. Boyce, "Originalism and the Fourteenth Amendment", 33 ''Wake Forest L. Rev.'' 909]&lt;/ref&gt; This notion stands in contrast to the concept of the [[living constitution]], which asserts that the Constitution is intended to be interpreted based on the context of the current times, even if such interpretation is different from the original interpretations of the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1115&amp;context=fss_papers | title=The Holmes Lectures: The Living Constitution | author=Ackerman, Bruce | publisher=Yale University Law School | date=January 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Two Views of the Constitution: Originalism vs. Non-Originalism | author=Vloet, Katie  | date=September 22, 2015 | publisher=University of Michigan Law | url=https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/ConstitutionDay_092215.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term originated in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Brest1980"&gt;Brest, Paul. (1980). ''The Misconceived Quest for the Original Understanding''. Boston University Law Review, '''60''', 204–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Originalism is an umbrella term for interpretative methods that hold to the "fixation thesis", the notion that an utterance's semantic content is fixed at the time it is uttered.&lt;ref name="SemanticOriginalism"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1120244 L. Solum, "Semantic Originalism", ''Illinois Public Law Research Paper '' No. 07-24]&lt;/ref&gt; Originalists seek one of two alternative sources of meaning:
* The ''[[original intent]] theory'', which holds that interpretation of a written constitution is (or should be) consistent with what was meant by those who drafted and ratified it. This is currently a minority view among originalists.
*The ''[[original meaning]] theory'', which is closely related to textualism, is the view that interpretation of a written constitution or law should be based on what [[reasonable person]]s living at the time of its adoption would have understood the [[plain meaning rule|ordinary meaning]] of the text to be. Most originalists, such as [[Antonin Scalia]], are associated with this view.

Such theories share the view that there is an identifiable original intent or original meaning, contemporaneous with the ratification of a constitution or statute, which should govern its subsequent interpretation. The divisions between the theories relate to what exactly that identifiable original intent or original meaning is: the intentions of the authors or the ratifiers, the original meaning of the text, a combination of the two, or the original meaning of the text but not its expected application.

==Strict constructionism==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
Bret Boyce described the origins of the term ''originalist'' as follows: The term "originalism" has been most commonly used since the middle 1980s and was apparently coined by [[Paul Brest]] in ''The Misconceived Quest for the Original Understanding''.&lt;ref name="Boyce"/&gt; It is often asserted that ''originalism'' is synonymous with ''[[strict constructionism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uchicagolaw.typepad.com/faculty/2005/10/i_am_not_a_stri.html The University of Chicago, The Law School] "I am not a strict constructionist, and no one ought to be."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polazzo.stuysu.org/can_bush_deliver_a_conservative.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 16, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051219192336/http://polazzo.stuysu.org/can_bush_deliver_a_conservative.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/mentions.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=December 16, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216121611/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/mentions.htm |archivedate=December 16, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklywire.com/ww/04-10-00/boston_feature_1.html|title=News &amp; Opinion: Who Would Bush Appoint to the Supreme Court?

[[File:Antonin Scalia, SCOTUS photo portrait.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Supreme Court Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] was a firm believer in originalism]]
Both theories are associated with textualist and formalist schools of thought, however there are pronounced differences between them.  Scalia differentiated the two by pointing out that, unlike an originalist, a strict constructionist would not acknowledge that ''he uses a cane'' means ''he walks with a cane'' (because, strictly speaking, this is not what ''he uses a cane'' means).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Smith v. United States'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/91-8674.ZD.html 508 U.S. 223] (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia averred that he was "not a strict constructionist, and no-one ought to be"; he goes further, calling strict constructionism "a degraded form of textualism that brings the whole philosophy into disrepute".&lt;ref&gt;A. Scalia, ''A Matter of Interpretation'', {{ISBN|978-0-691-00400-6}}, Amy Guttman ed. 1997, at p.23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originalism is a theory of ''interpretation'', not ''construction''.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, ''[http://www.bu.edu/rbarnett/Original.htm#IB The Original Meaning of the Commerce Clause]''&lt;/ref&gt; However, this distinction between "interpretation" and "construction" is controversial and is rejected by many nonoriginalists as artificial. As Scalia said, "the Constitution, or any text, should be interpreted [n]either strictly [n]or sloppily; it should be interpreted reasonably"; once originalism has told a Judge what the provision of the Constitution means, they are bound by that meaning—however the business of Judging is not simply to know what the text means (interpretation), but to take the law's necessarily general provisions and apply them to the specifics of a given case or controversy (construction). In many cases, the meaning might be so specific that no discretion is permissible, but in many cases, it is still before the Judge to say what a reasonable interpretation might be. A judge could, therefore, be both an originalist ''and'' a strict constructionist—but he is not one by virtue of being the other.

==Forms==
Originalism is actually a family of related views. As a movement, originalism can be traced to Robert Bork's "Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems", published in the ''Indiana Law Journal'' in January 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4149&amp;context=fss_papers |title=Neutral Principles and Some First Amendment Problems |author=Robert H. Bork |via=Digitalcommons.law.yale.edu |journal=Indiana Law Journal 1 |volume=47 |issue=1 |date=January 1971 |accessdate=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was not until the 1980s, when conservative jurists began to take seats on the Supreme Court, that the debate really began in earnest. "Old originalism" focused primarily on "intent", mostly by default. But that line was largely abandoned in the early 1990s; as "new originalism" emerged; most adherents subscribed to "original meaning" originalism, though there are some intentionalists within new originalism.

===Original intent===
{{Main article|Original intent}}
The ''original form of originalism'' is sometimes called intentionalism, or ''original intent'' originalism, and looked for the subjective intent of a law's enactors. One problem with this approach is identifying the relevant "lawmaker" whose intent is sought. For instance, the authors of the U.S. Constitution could be the particular [[Founding Fathers]] that drafted it, such as those on the Committee of Detail. Or, since the Constitution purports to originate from the People, one could look to the various state ratifying conventions. The intentionalist methodology involves studying the writings of its authors, or the records of the [[Philadelphia Convention]], or debates in the state legislatures, for clues as to their intent.

There are two kinds of ''intent analysis'', reflecting two meanings of the word ''intent''. The first, a rule of common law construction during the Founding Era, is ''functional'' intent. The second is ''motivational'' intent. To understand the difference, one can use the metaphor of an architect who designs a Gothic church with [[flying buttresses]]. The functional intent of flying buttresses is to prevent the weight of the roof from spreading the walls and causing a collapse of the building, which can be inferred from examining the design as a whole. The motivational intent might be to create work for his brother-in-law who is a flying buttress subcontractor. Using original intent analysis of the first kind, we can discern that the language of Article III of the [[U.S. Constitution]] was to delegate to Congress the power to allocate original and appellate jurisdictions, and not to remove some jurisdiction, involving a constitutional question, from all courts. That would suggest that the decision was wrong in ''[[Ex Parte McCardle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/ussc/074-506.htm Ex Parte McCardle], 74 U.S. 506 (Wall.) (1868)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Problems with intentionalism====
However, a number of problems are inherent in intentionalism, and ''[[a fortiori]]'' when that theory is applied to the Constitution.  For example, most of the Founders did not leave detailed discussions of what their intent was in 1787, and while a few did, there is no reason to think that they should be dispositive of what the rest thought.  Moreover, the discussions of the drafters may have been recorded; however they were not available to the ratifiers in each state.  The theory of original intent was challenged in a string of [[law review]] articles in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Powell, "The Original Understanding of Original Intent", 98 ''Harv. L. Rev.'' 885 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, original intent was seen as lacking good answers to three important questions: whether a diverse group such as the framers even ''had'' a single intent; if they ''did'', whether it could be determined from two centuries' distance; and whether the framers themselves would have supported original intent.&lt;ref&gt;See also, W. Serwetman, [http://www.ninjalawyer.com/writing/original.html ''Originalism At Work in Lopez: An Examination of the Recent Trend in Commerce Clause Jurisprudence'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this, a different strain of originalism, articulated by (among others) Antonin Scalia,&lt;ref&gt;See "A Matter of Interpretation", supra; see also, A. Scalia, ''[http://www.joink.com/homes/users/ninoville/lesserevil.asp Originalism: the Lesser Evil]'', 57 U. Cin. L. Rev. 849.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bork]],&lt;ref&gt;See R. Bork, ''The tempting of America: The political seduction of the law''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Randy Barnett]],&lt;ref&gt;See R. Barnett, ''An Originalism for non-Originalists'', 45 Loy. L. Rev. 611; R. Barnett, [[Restoring the Lost Constitution]].&lt;/ref&gt; came to the fore. This is dubbed [[Original meaning|original ''meaning'']].

===Original meaning===
{{Main article|Original meaning}}
Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] argued that interpreting what was meant by someone who wrote a law was not trying to "get into his mind" because the issue was "not what this man meant, but what those words would mean in the mouth of a normal speaker of English, using them in the circumstances in which they were used."&lt;ref&gt;O. W. Holmes, ''Collected Legal Papers'', {{ISBN|978-0-8446-1241-6}}, p.204&lt;/ref&gt; This is the essential precept of modern originalism.

The most robust and widely cited form of originalism, ''original meaning'', emphasizes how the text would have been understood by a reasonable person in the historical period during which the constitution was proposed, ratified, and first implemented. For example, economist Thomas Sowell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/thomassowell/ts20041110.shtml|title=Thomas Sowell Articles – Political Columnist &amp; Commentator|work=townhall.com|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; notes that phrases like "due process" and "freedom of the press" had a long established meaning in English law, even before they were put into the Constitution of the United States." Applying this form involves studying dictionaries and other writings of the time (for example, Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''; see "Matters rendered moot by originalism", ''infra'') to establish what particular terms meant. See ''Methodology'', infra).

Justice Scalia, one of the most forceful modern advocates for originalism, defined himself as belonging to the latter category:
{{quote|The theory of originalism treats a constitution like a statute, and gives it the meaning that its words were understood to bear at the time they were promulgated. You will sometimes hear it described as the theory of original intent. You will never hear me refer to original intent, because as I say I am first of all a textualist, and secondly an originalist. If you are a textualist, you don't care about the intent, and I don't care if the framers of the Constitution had some secret meaning in mind when they adopted its words. I take the words as they were promulgated to the people of the United States, and what is the fairly understood meaning of those words.&lt;ref&gt;See A. Scalia, [http://www.joink.com/homes/users/ninoville/cua10-18-96.asp A Theory of Constitution Interpretation], speech at Catholic University of America, 10/18/96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though there may be no evidence that the Founding Fathers intended the Constitution to be like a statute, this fact does not matter under Scalia's approach. Adherence to original meaning is explicitly divorced from the intent of the Founders; rather, the reasons for adhering to original meaning derive from other justifications, such as the argument that the understanding of the ratifiers (the people of the several States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution) should be controlling, as well as consequentialist arguments about original meaning's positive effect on rule of law.

Perhaps the clearest example illustrating the importance of the difference between original intent and original meaning is the [[Twenty-seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-seventh Amendment]]. The Twenty-seventh Amendment was proposed as part of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791, but failed to be ratified by the required number of states for two centuries, eventually being ratified in 1992. An original intent inquiry might ask what the framers understood the amendment to mean when it was written, though some would argue that it was the intent of the latter-day ratifiers that is important. An original-meaning inquiry would ask what the plain, public meaning of the text was in 1992 when it was eventually ratified.

====Semantic originalism====
''Semantic-originalism'' is [[Ronald Dworkin]]'s term for the theory that the original meaning of many statutes implies that those statutes prohibit certain acts widely considered not to be prohibited by the statutes at the time of their passages.  This type of originalism contrasts with ''expectations originalism'', which adheres to how the statutes functioned at the times of their passages, without any expectation that they would function in any other particular ways.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Randy.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XYuGAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95 Restoring the Lost Constitution]'', p. 95 (Princeton U. Press 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice Antonin Scalia and other originalists often claim that the death penalty is not "cruel and unusual punishment" because at the time of the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighth Amendment]]'s passage, it was a punishment believed to be neither cruel nor unusual. Dworkin and the semantic-originalists assert, however, that if advances in moral philosophy (presuming that such advances are possible) reveal that the death penalty is in fact "cruel and unusual", then the original meaning of the Eighth Amendment implies that the death penalty is unconstitutional. All the same, Justice Scalia purported to follow semantic originalism, although he conceded that Dworkin does not believe Scalia was true to that calling.&lt;ref&gt;Scalia, Antonin.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdcWjMktgz0C&amp;pg=PA144 A Matter of Interpretation: Federal Courts and the Law: Federal Courts and the Law]'', p. 144 (Princeton University Press 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Framework originalism===
Framework Originalism is an approach developed by [[Jack Balkin]], a professor of law at [[Yale Law School]]. Framework Originalism, or Living Originalism, is a blend of primarily two constitutional interpretive methods: originalism and [[Living Constitution]]. Balkin holds that there is no inherent contradiction between these two, aforementioned, interpretive approaches—when properly understood. Framework Originalists view the Constitution as an "initial framework for governance that sets politics in motion." This "framework" must be built-out or filled-out over time, successive generations, by the various legislative and judicial branches. This process is achieved, primarily, through building political institutions, passing legislation, and creating precedents (both judicial and non-judicial).&lt;ref&gt;Balkin, Jack (February 16, 2009). "[https://mail-attachment.googleusercontent.com/attachment/u/0/ui=2&amp;ik=71e20d8366&amp;view=att&amp;th=14002ff1398f9561&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=inline&amp;realattid=f_hjepyml70&amp;safe=1&amp;zw&amp;saduie=AG9B_P8T-RRitBW0sudznuZoXQGm&amp;sadet=1374972385770&amp;sads=zqzsbgJ8uQrxF1pBi6GI2pLjpWk&amp;sadssc=1 Framework Originalism and The Living Constitution], Public Law &amp; Legal Theory Research Paper Series" ''Yale Law School''. Retrieved July 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the process of building out the Constitution on top of the framework of the original meaning is living constitutionalism, the change of and progress of law over time to address particular (current) issues. The authority of the judiciary and of the political branches to engage in constitutional construction comes from their "joint responsiveness to public opinion" over long stretches of time, while operating within the basic framework of the original meaning. Balkin claims that through mechanisms of social influence, both judges and the political branches inevitably come to reflect and respond to changing social mores, norms, customs and (public) opinions.

According to Framework originalism, interpreters should adhere to the original meaning of the Constitution, but are not necessarily required to follow the original expected application (although they may use it to create doctrines and decide cases). For example, states should extend the equal protection of the laws to all peoples, in cases where it would not originally or normally be applied to. Contemporary interpreters are not bound by how people in 1868 would have applied these words and meanings to issues such as racial segregation or (sexual) discrimination, largely due to the fact the fourteenth amendment is concerned with such issues (as well as the fact that the fourteenth amendment was not proposed or ratified by the founders). When the Constitution uses or applies principles or standards, like "equal protection" or "unreasonable searches and seizures," further construction is usually required, by either the judiciary, the executive or legislative branch. Therefore, Balkin claims, (pure, unadulterated) originalism is not sufficient to decide a wide range of cases or controversies. Judges, he posits, will have to "engage in considerable constitutional construction as well as the elaboration and application of previous constructions." For example, originalism (in and of itself), is not sufficient enough to constrain judicial behavior. Constraint itself does not just come from doctrine or canons, it also comes from institutional, political, and cultural sources. These constraints include: multi-member or panel courts (where the balance of power lies with moderate judges); the screening of judges through the federal judicial appointment process; social and cultural influences on the judiciary (which keep judges attuned and attentive to popular opinions and the political will of the people); and prevailing professional legal culture and professional conceptions of the role of the judiciary (which produce social norms or mores). These constraints ensure that judges act as impartial arbiters of the law and to try to behave in a principled manner, as it applies to decision making.

==Methodology==
In "The Original Meaning of the Recess Appointments Clause",  Michael B. Rappaport described the methodology associated with the "original meaning" form of originalism as follows:

*"The task is to determine the original meaning of the language … that is, to understand how knowledgeable individuals would have understood this language…when it was drafted and ratified. Interpreters at the time would have examined various factors, including text, purpose, structure, and history."
*"The most important factor is the text of the Clause. The modern interpreter should read the language in accord with the meaning it would have had in the late 1780s. Permissible meanings from that time include the ordinary meanings as well as more technical legal meanings words may have had."
*"If the language has more than one interpretation, then one would look to purpose, structure, and history to help to clarify the ambiguity. Purpose, structure, and history provide evidence for determining which meaning of the language the authors would have intended."
**"The purpose of a Clause involves the objectives or goals that the authors would have sought to accomplish in enacting it. One common and permissible way to discern the purpose is to look to the evident or obvious purpose of a provision. Yet, purpose arguments can be dangerous, because it is easy for interpreters to focus on one purpose to the exclusion of other possible purposes without any strong arguments for doing so."
**"Historical evidence can reveal the values that were widely held by the Framers' generation and that presumably informed their purposes when enacting constitutional provisions. History can also reveal their practices, which when widely accepted would be evidence of their values."
**"The structure of the document can also help to determine the purposes of the Framers. The decision to enact one constitutional clause may reveal the values of the Framers and thereby help us understand the purposes underlying a second constitutional clause."
*"One additional source of evidence about the meaning of constitutional language is early constitutional interpretations by government officials or prominent commentators. …Such interpretations may provide evidence of the original meaning of the provisions, because early interpreters would have had better knowledge of contemporary word meanings, societal values, and interpretive techniques. Of course, early interpreters may also have had political and other incentives to misconstrue the document that should be considered." (Id. at 5–7).

==Discussion==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

===Philosophical underpinnings===
Originalism, in all its various forms, is predicated on a specific view of what the Constitution ''is'', a view articulated by Chief Justice John Marshall in ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'':
{{quote|[T]he constitution organizes the government, and assigns to different departments their respective powers. It may either stop here; or establish certain limits not to be transcended by those departments.

The government of the United States is of the latter description. The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, the constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing; if these limits may, at any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained?}}

Originalism assumes that ''Marbury'' is correct: the Constitution is the ''operating charter'' granted to government by the people, as per the preamble to the [[United States Constitution]], and its written nature introduces a certain discipline into its interpretation. Originalism further assumes that the need for such a written charter was derived from the perception, on the part of the Framers, of the [[abuses of power]] under the (unwritten) [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British Constitution]], under which the Constitution was essentially whatever Parliament decided it should be. In writing out a Constitution which explicitly granted the government certain authorities, and withheld from it others, and in which power was balanced between multiple agencies (the [[President of the United States of America|Presidency]], two chambers of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] at the national level, and [[State governments of the United States]] with similar branches), the intention of the Framers was to restrain government, originalists argue, and the value of such a document is nullified if that document's meaning is not fixed. As one author stated, "If the constitution can mean anything, then the constitution is reduced to meaninglessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRjZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22if+the+constitution+can+mean+anything%22&amp;dq=%22if+the+constitution+can+mean+anything%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KhjCTaLfOKfgiAKwiYWrAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw|title=The New Guard|publisher=|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function of constitutional jurisprudence===
Dissenting in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'', Scalia wrote:
{{quote|Since the Constitution of the United States says nothing about this subject, it is left to be resolved by normal democratic means, including the democratic adoption of provisions in state constitutions. This Court has no business imposing upon all Americans the resolution favored by the elite class from which the Members of this institution are selected.}}

This statement summarizes the role for the court envisioned by originalists, that is, that the Court parses what the general law and constitution says of a particular [[case or controversy]], and when questions arise as to the meaning of a given constitutional provision, that provision should be given the meaning it was understood to mean when ratified. Reviewing Steven D Smith's book ''Law's Quandary'', Scalia applied this formulation to some controversial topics routinely brought before the Court:
{{quote|It troubles Smith, but does not at all trouble me—in fact, it pleases me—that giving the words of the Constitution their normal meaning would "expel from the domain of legal issues … most of the constitutional disputes that capture our attention", such as "Can a macho military educational institution dedicated to what is euphemistically called the 'adversative' method admit only men? Is there a right to abortion? Or to the assistance of a physician in ending one's life?" If we should read English as English, Smith bemoans, "these questions would seemingly all have received the same answer: 'No law on that one.{{'"}}

That is precisely the answer they should have received: The federal Constitution says nothing on these subjects, which are therefore left to be governed by state law.&lt;ref&gt;A. Scalia, ''[http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft0511/reviews/scalia.html Law &amp; Language]''; ''First Things'', November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Marbury'', [[Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] established that the Supreme Court could invalidate laws which violated the Constitution (that is, [[judicial review]]), which helped establish the Supreme Court as having its own distinct sphere of influence within the federal government. However, this power was itself balanced with the requirement that the Court could only invalidate legislation if it was ''unconstitutional''. Originalists argue that the modern court no longer follows this requirement. They argue that—since  ''[[U.S. v. Darby]]'', in which Justice [[Harlan Fiske Stone|Stone]] (writing for a unanimous Court) ruled that the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] had no legal meaning—the Court has increasingly taken to making rulings&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, ''[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0381_0479_ZS.html Griswold v. Connecticut]'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0381_0479_ZS.html 381 U.S. 479] (1965); ''[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html Roe v. Wade]'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0410_0113_ZS.html 410 U.S. 113] (1973); ''[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0487_0654_ZS.html Morrison v. Olson]'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0487_0654_ZS.html 487 U.S. 654] (1988); ''[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html Lawrence v. Texas]'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html 539 U.S. 558] (2003); ''[http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-633.ZO.html Roper v. Simmons]'', [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/03-633.ZO.html Docket No. 03—633] (2005); ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]], [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/04-108.ZO.html Docket No. 04-108]'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Court has determined not what the Constitution ''says'', but rather, the Court has sought to determine what is "morally correct" at ''this'' point in the nation's history, in terms of "the evolving standards of decency" (and considering "the context of international jurisprudence"), and then justified that determination through a "creative reading" of the text. This latter approach is frequently termed "the [[Living constitution]]"; Scalia inveighed that "the worst thing about the living constitution is that it will destroy the constitution".&lt;ref&gt;See Scalia, [http://www.joink.com/homes/users/ninoville/ww3-14-05.asp Constitutional Interpretation], speech at Woodrow Wilson International Center 3/14/05&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matters rendered moot by originalism===
Originalists are sharply critical of the use of ''the evolving standards of decency'' (a term which first appeared in ''[[Trop v. Dulles]]'') and of reference to the opinions of courts in foreign countries (excepting treaties to which the United States is a signatory, per Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution) in Constitutional interpretation.

In an originalist interpretation, if the meaning of the Constitution is static, then any ex post facto information (such as the opinions of the American people, American judges, or the judiciaries of any foreign country) is inherently valueless for interpretation of the meaning of the Constitution, and should not form any part of constitutional jurisprudence. The Constitution is thus fixed and has procedures defining how it can be changed.

The exception to the use of foreign law is the English [[common law]], which originalists regard as setting the philosophical stage for the US Constitution and the American common and civil law. Hence, an originalist might cite [[William Blackstone|Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England|Commentaries]]'' to establish the meaning of the term ''[[due process]]'' as it would have been understood at the time of ratification.

==Pros and cons==
Arguments for and against Originalism should be read in conjunction with alternative views and rebuttals, presented in footnotes.

===Arguments favoring originalism===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2008}}
* If a constitution no longer meets the exigencies of a society's "evolving standard of decency", and the people wish to [[Constitutional amendment|amend]] or replace the document, there is nothing stopping them from doing so in the manner which was envisioned by the drafters: through the amendment process. The [[Living Constitution]] approach would thus only be valuable in the absence of an amendment process.
* Originalism deters judges from unfettered discretion to inject their personal values into constitutional interpretation. Before one can reject originalism, one must find another criterion for determining the meaning of a provision, lest the "opinion of this Court [rest] so obviously upon nothing however the personal views of its members".&lt;ref&gt;See ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=00-8452#section3 Atkins v. Virginia]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=00-8452#section3 536 U.S. 304] (2002) (Scalia, dissenting)&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia has averred that "there is no other" criterion to constrain judicial interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Scalia, Woodrow Wilson speech, supra&lt;/ref&gt;
* Originalism helps ensure predictability and protects against arbitrary changes in the interpretation of a constitution; to reject originalism implicitly repudiates the theoretical underpinning of another theory of stability in the law, ''[[stare decisis]]''.
* If a constitution as interpreted can truly be changed at the decree of a judge, then "[t]he Constitution… is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which they may twist and shape into any form they please," said [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_18s16.html|title=Thomas Jefferson to Spencer Roane|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the purpose of the constitution would be defeated, and there would be no reason to have one.
* Sometimes the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] is cited as an example by originalism critics to attack originalism. Self-described originalists have been at least as willing as judges of other schools to give the Ninth Amendment no substantive meaning or to treat it as ''surplusage duplicative'' of the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]]. Bork described it as a Rorshach blot and claimed that the courts had no power to identify or protect the rights supposedly protected by it. Scalia held similarly: "[T]he Constitution's refusal to 'deny or disparage' other rights is far removed from affirming any one of them, and even afarther removed from authorizing judges to identify what they might be, and to enforce the judges' list against laws duly enacted by the people." ''[[Troxel v. Granville]]'' 530 U.S. 57 (2000) (Scalia, J. Dissenting). Scalia's interpretation renders the Ninth Amendment entirely unenforcable and moot, which is clearly contrary to its original intent. However, this is a criticism of specific originalists—and a criticism that they are insufficiently originalist—not a criticism of originalism. The theory of originalism as a whole is entirely compatible with the Ninth Amendment. Alternative theories of originalism have been argued by Randy Barnett that give the Ninth Amendment more practical effect than many other schools of legal thought do.
* Contrary to critics of originalism, originalists do not always agree upon an answer to a constitutional question, nor is there any requirement that they have to. There is room for disagreement as to what original meaning was, and even more as to how that original meaning applies to the situation before the court. But the originalist at least knows what he is looking for: the original meaning of the text. Usually, that is easy to discern and simple to apply. Sometimes there will be disagreement regarding the original meaning; and sometimes there will be disagreement as to how that original meaning applies to new and unforeseen phenomena. How, for example, does the First Amendment of the U.S. constitution guarantee of "the freedom of speech" apply to new technologies that did not exist when the guarantee was codified—to sound trucks,&lt;!-- huh? what is a 'sound truck'? perhaps a better example is needed --&gt; or to government-licensed over-the-air television? In such new fields the Court must follow the trajectory of the First Amendment, so to speak, to determine what it requires, and that enterprise is not entirely cut-and-dried, but requires the exercise of judgment. But the difficulties and uncertainties of determining original meaning and applying it to modern circumstances are negligible compared with the difficulties and uncertainties of the philosophy which says that the constitution changes; that the very act which it once prohibited it now permits, and which it once permitted it now forbids; and that the key to that change is unknown and unknowable. The originalist, if he does not have all the answers, has many of them.&lt;ref name="Scalia"&gt;[http://www.tannerlectures.utah.edu/lectures/documents/scalia97.pdf Common-Law Courts in a Civil-Law System: The Role of United States Federal Courts in Interpreting the Constitution and Laws]&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the people come to believe that the constitution is not a text like other texts; if it means, not what it says or what it was understood to mean, but what it should mean, in light of the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society, they will look for qualifications other than impartiality, judgment, and lawyerly acumen in those whom they elect to interpret it. More specifically, they will look for people who agree with them as to what those evolving standards have evolved to; who agree with them as to what the constitution ought to be. If the courts are free to write the Constitution anew, they will write it the way the majority wants; the appointment and confirmation process will see to that. This suggests the end of the Bill of Rights, whose meaning will be committed to the very body it was meant to protect against: the majority. By trying to make the Constitution do everything that needs doing from age to age, we shall have caused it to do nothing at all.&lt;ref name="Scalia" /&gt;

===Arguments opposing originalism===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2008}}

* If one is then to look at the interpretation (or, ''meaning''), which inheres at the particular time period, the question becomes: why is that reading the essential one? Or, restated, an essential reading, then, is owing to whom? Is it owing, then, to the meaning derived by the average person at that time? The collective intent of the voters who passed it? Or is it possible that they indeed entrusted the framers with the authority to draft the constitution; i.e., that the intent of the drafters should remain relevant?  Originalism faces [[hermeneutic]] difficulties in understanding the intentions of the Founding Fathers, who lived 200 years ago (original intent), or the context of the time in which they lived (original meaning). Justice Scalia accepted this problem: "It's not always easy to figure out what the provision meant when it was adopted…I do not say [originalism] is perfect. I just say it's better than anything else".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041009/NEWS/410090381/1002|title=Scalia talks up 'originalism' in UVM speech : Times Argus Online|publisher=|accessdate=March 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Legal controversy rarely arises over constitutional text with uncontroversial interpretations. How, then, does one determine the original "meaning" of an originally broad and ambiguous phrase?  Thus, originalists often conceal their choice between levels of generality or possible alternative meanings as required by the original meaning when there is considerable room for disagreement.
* It could be argued (as, for example, Justice [[Stephen Breyer|Breyer]] has) that constitutions are meant to endure over time, and in order to do so, their interpretation must therefore be more flexible and responsive to changing circumstances than the amendment process.
* Originalists often argue that, where a constitution is silent, judges should not read rights into it (i.e. a [[textualist]] interpretation).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailysignal.com/2017/02/10/neil-gorsuch-is-trumps-best-revenge-for-judicial-activism|title=Neil Gorsuch Is Trump's Best Revenge for Judicial Activism|last=2017|date=February 10, 2017|website=The Daily Signal|access-date=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]], seen through an originalist lens, can be seen as providing the judiciary with means of protecting {{clarify span|text=rights|explain=but only rights cognizable originally, so that there would be no instance of originalism sanctioning rights derived only from evolution over time.  Thus there should be no inconsistency in originalism as is claimed in the next sentence of the article.  Therefore the logic of this paragraph of the article appears to be erroneous, which very probably means that the line of reasoning exemplified in such paragraph is not seen in reliable sources, which would mean that such paragraph of the article constitutes original analysis, which is prohibited in Wikipedia.|date=March 2017}} which the founders had not thought, for whatever reasons, to explicitly list, such as rights involving abortion, gender and [[sexual orientation]] [[equal protection|equality]], and capital punishment. This presents a particular challenge to the theory of Original Intent, which seems to thus suggest just the opposite of what the text of the Constitution and ''original intent'' of the founders arguably affirm, creating an inconsistency in the practice of at least one branch of Originalism. The subsequent Tenth Amendment, detailing non-enumerated rights as the sole property of the states and the people, is often cited as the clarification for this inconsistency and the reason why the federal courts have no say in affirming or denying said rights per the Ninth Amendment.
* Originalism allows the ''dead hand'' of prior generations to control important contemporary issues to an extraordinary and unnecessary level of detail. While everyone agrees that broad constitutional principles should control, if the question is whether abortion is a fundamental right, why should past centuries-old intentions be controlling? The originalist's distinction between original meaning and original intention here is unclear due to the difficulty of discussing ''meaning'' in terms of specific details that the Constitutional text does not clarify.
* In writing such a broad phrase such as "cruel and unusual", it is considered implausible by some that the framers intended for its very specific meaning at that time to be permanently controlling. The purpose of phrases such as "cruel and unusual," rather, is specifically not to specify which punishments are forbidden, but to create a flexible test that can be applied over future centuries. Stated alternatively, there is no reason to think the framers have a privileged position in making this determination of what is cruel and unusual; while their ban on cruel punishment is binding on us, their understanding of the scope of the concept "cruel" need not be.
* If applied scrupulously, originalism requires the country either to continually reratify the Constitution in order to retain contemporary standards for tests such as "cruel and unusual punishment" or "unreasonable searches and seizures," or to change the language to specifically state that these tests shall be administered according to the standards of the society administering the test. Critics of originalism believe that the first approach is too burdensome, while the second is already inherently implied.

====Arguments against some of the proponents of originalism====

* Critics argue that originalism, as applied by its most prominent proponents, is sometimes pretext (or, at least, the "rules" of originalism are sometimes "bent") to reach desired ends, no less so than the Living Constitution. For example, [[Jack Balkin]] has averred that neither the original understanding nor the original intent of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] is compatible with the result implicitly reached by the originalist justices Thomas and Scalia in their willingness to join Chief Justice Rehnquist's concurrence in [[Bush v. Gore]], {{ussc|531|98|2000}}. Furthermore, while both Scalia and Thomas have objected on originalist grounds to the use of foreign law by the court (see, respectively, ''Thompson v. Oklahoma'', {{ussc-cite|487|815|868|1988}}, and ''Knight v. Florida'', {{ussc|528|990|1999}}), both have allowed it to seep into their opinions at one time or another (see, respectively, ''McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Committee'', {{ussc-cite|514|334|381|1995}} and ''Holder v. Hall'', {{ussc-cite|512|874|904|1994}})
* Another example is the centrality of the concept of "person" to the Constitution and the fact that any claim by originalists such as Bork, Scalia, or Thomas that the Constitution does not speak to human rights and gender equality ''[[A fortiori argument|a fortiori]]'' reflects a judicial effort to legislate meaning into the term Person; for example, Scalia's assertion that women's equality is entirely up to the political branches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Adam|title=Justice Scalia Mouths Off on Sex Discrimination|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2020667,00.html|accessdate=December 12, 2012|newspaper=Time|date=September 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ignores the use of the term "person" rather than "man" in the Constitution, and the common meaning of the term at the time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Fischer|first=David Hackett|authorlink=David Hackett Fischer|title=[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]]|year=1989|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-506905-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead interprets the Constitution to say that only heterosexual men and male fetuses are "persons" thus reading silence into the Constitution on a matter on which it is not silent for the purpose of narrowing the Constitution's meaning. The device of "originalism" is thus used to replace the original intent, the original meaning, and the text itself with Scalia's subjective view or desires.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6433">'''PCLake''' is a dynamic, [[mathematical model]] used to study [[eutrophication]] effects in shallow [[lake]]s and ponds. PCLake models explicitly the most important [[Biotic component|biotic]] groups and their interrelations, within the general framework of [[nutrient cycle]]s. PCLake is used both by scientist and water managers.

==Background==
Typically, shallow lakes are in one of two contrasting [[alternative stable state]]s:&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer M, 1993. Alternative equilibria in shallow lakes. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 8: 275–-279&lt;/ref&gt;  a clear state with submerged macrophytes and piscivorous fish, or a turbid state dominated by phytoplankton and benthivorous fish. A switch from one state to the other is largely driven by the input of nutrients ([[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]]) to the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 1997. A model of nutrient dynamics in shallow lakes in relation to multiple stable states. Hydrobiologia 342/343: 1–8&lt;/ref&gt; If the nutrient loading exceeds a critical value, eutrophication causes a switch from the clear to the turbid state. As a result of urban water pollution and/or [[intensive agriculture]] in [[drainage basin|catchment areas]], many of the world’s shallow lakes and ponds are in a eutrophic state with turbid waters and poor ecological quality. In this turbid state, the lake also becomes subject to algal blooms of toxic [[cyanobacteria]] (also called blue-green algae). Recovery of the clear state however is difficult as the critical nutrient loading for the switch back is often found to be lower than the critical loading towards the turbid state. Lowering the nutrient input thus does not automatically lead to a switch back to the clear water phase. Hence, the system shows [[hysteresis]].

==Application==
PCLake is designed to study the effects of eutrophication on shallow lakes and ponds.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH, 2005. Model studies on the eutrophication of shallow lakes and ditches. PhD thesis. Wageningen University&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, the model is used by scientists to study the general behavior of these ecosystems. For example, PCLake is used to understand the phenomena of alternative stable states and hysteresis, and in that light, the relative importance of lake features such as water depth or [[fetch (geography)|fetch length]].&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH and others, 2008. Critical phosphorus loading of different types of shallow lakes and the consequences for management estimated with the ecosystem model PCLake. Limnologica 38: 2003–2019&lt;/ref&gt; Also the potential effects of climate warming for shallow lakes have been studied.&lt;ref&gt;Mooij WM and others, 2007. Predicting the effect of climate change on temperate shallow lakes with the ecosystem model PCLake. Hydrobiologia 584: 443–454&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, PCLake is applied by lake water resource managers that consider the turbid state as undesirable. They can use the model to define the critical loadings for their specific lakes and evaluate the effectiveness of restoration measures. For this purpose also a meta-model has been developed.&lt;ref&gt;http://themasites.pbl.nl/modellen/pclake/&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-model can be used by water managers to derive an estimate of the critical loading values for a certain lake based on only a few important parameters, without the need of running the full dynamical model.&lt;ref&gt;Schep, S. (in Dutch) 2010. Neuraal netwerk PCLake ten behoeve van KRW-verkenner. Witteveen+Bos; rapportnr. UT565-2-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model content==
Mathematically, PCLake is composed of a set of coupled [[differential equation]]s. With a large number of [[state variables]] (&gt;100) and [[parameters]] (&gt;300), the model may be characterized as relatively complex. The main biotic variables are [[phytoplankton]] and [[submerged aquatic vegetation]], describing [[primary production]]. A simplified [[food web]] is made up of [[zooplankton]], zoo[[benthos]], young and adult whitefish and piscivorous fish. The main abiotic factors are transparency and the nutrients phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and silica (Si). At the base of the model are the water and nutrient budgets (in- and outflow). The model describes a completely mixed water body and comprises both the water column and the upper sediment layer. The overall nutrient cycles for N, P and Si are described as completely closed (except for in- and outflow and [[denitrification]]). Inputs to the model are: lake hydrology, nutrient loading, dimensions and sediment characteristics. The model calculates [[chlorophyll]]-a, transparency, cyanobacteria, vegetation cover and fish biomass, as well as the concentrations and fluxes of nutrients N, P and Si, and oxygen. Optionally, a wetland zone with marsh vegetation and water exchange with the lake can be included.

PCLake is calibrated against nutrient, transparency, chlorophyll and vegetation data on more than 40 European (but mainly Dutch) lakes, and systematic sensitivity and uncertainty analysis have been performed.&lt;ref&gt;Janse JH and others, 2010. Estimating the critical phosphorus loading of shallow lakes with the ecosystem model PCLake: sensitivity, calibration and uncertainty. Ecological Modelling 221: 654–665&lt;/ref&gt;
Although PCLake is primarily used for Dutch lakes, it is likely that the model is also applicable to comparable non-[[stratification (water)|stratifying]] lakes in other regions, if parameters are adjusted or some small changes to the model are made.

==Model development==
The first version of PCLake (by then called PCLoos) was built in the early 1990s at the [[Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment]] (RIVM), within the framework of a research and restoration project on Lake Loosdrecht. It has been extended and improved since then. Parallel to PCLake, [[PCDitch]] was created, which is an ecosystem model for ditches and other linear water bodies. The models were further developed by dr. Jan H. Janse and colleagues at the [[Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency]] (PBL), formerly part of the RIVM. Since 2009, the model is jointly owned by PBL and the Netherlands Institute of Ecology, where further development and application of PCLake is taking place, related to aquatic-ecological research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7292">'''The Pacific Northwest Labor and Civil Rights History Projects''' are a series of multimedia public history initiatives. The projects cover a range of themes and subjects in the Northwest and Seattle, with a particular focus on working people and their movements. The effort, particularly the [[Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project]], has garnered praise for the breadth of primary and secondary resources made available and its joint creation by academics, community members and hundreds of students. It has been recognized as a model of digital and publicly engaged scholarship.&lt;ref name=Dublin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dublin|first=Thomas|title=The New Labor History, the New Media, and New Challenges|journal=Labor: Studies in Working-Class History of the Americas|date=Summer 2010|volume=7|issue=2|pages=83–96 |url=http://depts.washington.edu/labhist/labor_review.pdf|doi=10.1215/15476715-2009-078}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klinetobe|first=Charles|title=Review:The Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|url=http://digitalhistory.unl.edu//p-reviews/seattleklinetobe.php|work=Digital History Project|publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffey|first=Trevor|title=Rethinking Race and Place: The Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|journal=OAH Magazine of History|date=January 2012|volume=26|issue=1|pages=47–50|url=http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/1/47.full?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=IeFmtkRZYTKf7CO|doi=10.1093/oahmag/oar049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The primary projects in the series are the [[Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project]], [[Great Depression in Washington State Project|the Great Depression in Washington State Project]], [[Waterfront workers history project|the Waterfront Workers History Project]], [[the Labor Press Project]], [[Seattle General Strike Project|the Seattle General Strike Project]], [[Communism in Washington State History and Memory Project|the Communism in Washington State Project]] and the Antiwar and Radical History Project. The [[Strikes! Labor History Encyclopedia for the Pacific Northwest]] draws together the resources available on the other sites and adds additional information on workers from the many industries and communities of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey|title=Seattle Civil Rights &amp; Labor History Project: an Online Video Oral History Collection|journal=Northwest Oral History Association Newsletter|date=Spring 2007|url=http://depts.washington.edu/civilr3/pdf/NOHA%20Spring%2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these resources are only digitized and available through the projects, having been culled from archival material and personal collections and materials including the only known film of the 1919 Seattle General Strike and the 1934 West Coast Waterfront Strike are exceedingly rare.

==Impact==
The Projects have gained attention as a trailblazing initiative in public scholarship and engagement between the University of Washington and the Seattle community to record histories like [http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/Cannery_intro.htm Filipino Cannery Unionism] and the [[Chicano/a Movement in Washington State History Project|Chicano Movement in Washington State]] that are largely unavailable elsewhere. A unique, collaborative process has also given community members greater control over content than traditional academic research and created more investment by students in their work &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole|first=Peter|title=Web Site Review: Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|journal=Journal of American History|date=March 2008|volume=95|issue=4|url=http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/issues/954/wr4.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110070938/http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/issues/954/wr4.html|archivedate=2013-11-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosales-Castaneda|first=Oscar|title=Writing Chicana/o History with the Seattle Civil Rights and Labor History Project|journal=Writing History in the Digital Age|date=Spring 2012|url=http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu/public-history/rosales-castaneda-2012-spring/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of the Projects beyond the academic realm was demonstrated when Washington State law on neighborhood association covenants changed as a result of information brought to light on racially exclusive housing covenants that remained in neighborhood charters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turnbull|first=Lornet|title=Homeowners find records still hold blot of racism|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002297312_covenants03m.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=June 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gregory|first=James|title=Stain of racism still haunts Seattle neighborhoods|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/opinion/2002913362_jamesgregory06.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, the projects have brought light to rarely studied stories, like the Seattle Black Panther Party. The local Chapter was one of the first founded outside Oakland and one of the longest lived. The Civil Rights and Labor History Project unearthed material and conducted oral histories that form the largest body of material on any Party chapter in the nation, including the founding chapter in Oakland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Solomon|first=Cara|title=The story of Seattle's Black Panther Party|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003009057_blackpanthers21m.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=May 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
All of the projects have been notable for the quantity of material made available online. The Labor Press Project hosts thousands of digitized articles from more than thirty different union and radical newspapers, and the Strikes! Labor History Encyclopedia contains a day-by-day database of articles from the Northwest related to labor covering the crucial periods of 1915-1919 and 1930-1939. Video oral histories are key part of the projects, showing first-hand perspectives that are placed alongside original academic essays and digitized historical materials.&lt;ref name=Dublin /&gt; The Projects have also focused on outreach to Washington Public Schools, working with educators to design curriculum using the materials to teach students about the sometimes forgotten history of labor and civil rights in the Northwest and fulfill State requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=James|author2=Trevor Griffey|title=Teaching a City about Its Civil Rights History: A Public History Success Story|journal=Perspectives|date=April 2007|volume=45|issue=4|url=http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2007/0704/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4349">In [[mathematics]], specifically in the study of [[ordinary differential equation]]s, the '''Peano existence theorem''', '''Peano theorem''' or '''Cauchy–Peano theorem''', named after [[Giuseppe Peano]] and [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]], is a fundamental [[theorem]] which guarantees the [[existence]] of solutions to certain [[initial value problem]]s.

==History==
Peano first published the theorem in 1886 with an incorrect proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Peano |title=Sull’integrabilità delle equazioni differenziali del primo ordine |journal=Atti Accad. Sci. Torino |volume=21 |year=1886 |pages=437–445 |url=https://archive.org/stream/attidellaraccade21real#page/436/mode/2up/search/peano }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he published a new correct proof using successive approximations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=G. |last=Peano |title=Demonstration de l’intégrabilité des équations différentielles ordinaires |journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] |volume=37 |issue=2 |year=1890 |pages=182–228 |doi=10.1007/BF01200235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorem==
Let ''D'' be an [[open subset|open]] subset of '''R''' × '''R''' with
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon D \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
a continuous function and
:&lt;math&gt;y'(x) = f\left(x,y(x)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
a [[continuous function|continuous]], [[explicit ordinary differential equation|explicit]] [[first-order differential equation]] defined on ''D'', then every initial value problem
:&lt;math&gt;y\left(x_0\right) = y_0&lt;/math&gt;
for ''f'' with &lt;math&gt;(x_0, y_0) \in D&lt;/math&gt;
has a local solution
:&lt;math&gt;z\colon I \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,
such that &lt;math&gt; z'(x) = f\left(x,z(x)\right) &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; x \in I &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Coddington|Levinson|1955|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution need not be unique: one and the same initial value (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) may give rise to many different solutions ''z''.

==Related theorems==
The Peano theorem can be compared with another existence result in the same context, the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]]. The Picard–Lindelöf theorem both assumes more and concludes more. It requires [[Lipschitz continuity]], while the Peano theorem requires only continuity; but it proves both existence and uniqueness where the Peano theorem proves only the existence of solutions. To illustrate, consider the [[ordinary differential equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;y' = \left\vert y\right\vert^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; on the domain &lt;math&gt; \left[0, 1\right].&lt;/math&gt;

According to the Peano theorem, this equation has solutions, but the Picard–Lindelöf theorem does not apply since the right hand side is not Lipschitz continuous in any neighbourhood containing 0. Thus we can conclude existence but not uniqueness. It turns out that this ordinary differential equation has two kinds of solutions when starting at &lt;math&gt;y(0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;y(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y(x)=x^2/4&lt;/math&gt;. The transition between &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=(x-C)^2/4&lt;/math&gt; can happen at any C.

The [[Carathéodory's existence theorem|Carathéodory existence theorem]] is a generalization of the Peano existence theorem with weaker conditions than continuity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3880">According to the '''Porter hypothesis''', strict [[environmental regulation]]s can induce efficiency and encourage innovations that help improve commercial competitiveness. The hypothesis was formulated by the economist [[Michael Porter]] in an article in 1995.

The hypothesis suggests that strict environmental regulation triggers the discovery and introduction of cleaner technologies and environmental improvements, '''the innovation effect''', making production processes and products more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, M.: The Porter Hypothesis Revisited. A Literature Review of Theoretical Model and Empirical Test. Lüneburg: Centre for Sustainability Management, 2003, p.2 [http://www2.leuphana.de/umanagement/csm/content/nama/downloads/download_publikationen/38-2downloadversion.pdf CSM Lüneburg]&lt;/ref&gt; The cost savings that can be achieved are sufficient to overcompensate for both the compliance costs directly attributed to new regulations and the innovation costs.

In the [[first mover advantage]], a company is able to exploit innovation by [[learning curve]] effects or [[patent]]ing and attains a dominating competitive position compared to companies in countries where environmental regulations were enforced much later.

The Porter hypothesis has been applied to [[Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals|REACH]].

Various studies found that stricter environmental regulation stimulates innovation ("weak" version of Porter hypothesis). There is mixed evidence whether stricter regulation enhances business performance ("strong" version).&lt;ref&gt;''The Porter Hypothesis at 20. Can Environmental Regulation Enhance Innovation and

'''Proteak''' is a forestry company that cultivates [[teak]] trees on plantations located on reclaimed ranch lands in the dry tropical regions of [[Mexico]] and [[Latin America]]. Based out of [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]], Proteak has satellite offices in [[Wimberley]], [[Texas]] and [[Tepic]], [[Mexico]]. At their manufacturing facilities, Proteak produces a range of teak products including: [[cutting board]]s, [[butcher block]]s, [[deck (building)|decking]], [[flooring]] and [[lumber]].

== History ==
Proteak Renewable Forestry, SAPIB was founded in 2000 by a group of investors in the [[US]] and [[Mexico]]. Forestry management operations began in 2000 with the planting of teak forests along the [[Pacific]] coast of [[Mexico]]. In 2006, Proteak began to offer its first commercial product lines.

In 2010, Proteak reported that having over 8,000 acres&lt;ref&gt;http://www.proteak.com/home.html&lt;/ref&gt; under cultivation on reclaimed ranch lands, while protecting roughly 2,000 of virgin tropical forests adjacent to those plantations. As part of the company's operating guidelines, Proteak preserves standing forests on the properties that it acquires. Proteak's sustainable practices have earned its plantations a [[Forest Stewardship Council]] certificate.

Proteak's IPO closed on June 30, 2010, selling approximately 79 million shares&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3024399920100630&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Mexican Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aw5mwv7fUknY&amp;pos=7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plantation Teak ==

Due to the high demand for teak lumber, commercial forestry operations began to grow teak in dry tropical climates around the world throughout the 20th century. The deforestation of teak's natural range in [[Southeast Asia]] and trade sanctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/burma/burma.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527120417/http://www.ustreas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/burma/burma.shtml |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; imposed by the [[US Treasury Department]], have not only served to drive the cost of [[teak]] higher, but have also led consumers to look for environmentally sustainable sources of tropical hardwood lumber.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theinteriorevolution.com/archives/1536&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plantation Teak]] can be cultivated sustainably and is typically priced substantially lower than old growth teak.

Although the world's largest remaining teak forests are located inside [[Burma]], the human rights violations perpetrated by the government of [[Myanmar]] have cause some consumers to refer to teak from the region as "conflict teak."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/thailand/091214/thailand-conflict-timber-burmese-teak?page=0,0&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rumors suggest that teak trees grown on a plantation exhibit lower densities than those grown in Southeast Asia. However, studies conducted by the [[USDA]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/pdf2001/willi01d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have found no significant correlation between growth rate and its density.

== Kitchen products ==
Proteak's most visible product line include cutting boards, butcher blocks, counter tops and other kitchen accessories. The timber used to manufacture these products comes entirely from Proteak's FSC certified plantations.

Teak is often used in kitchen applications because of its highly resilient characteristics compared to other hardwoods. Equipped with a naturally high level of oily resins called tectoquinones, teak wood has a unique ability to repel moisture, fungi, warping and rot. Plantation teak kitchen products are often popular with environmentally conscious chefs who prefer the material for its relatively small [[ecological footprint]].

Compared with other sustainable options like bamboo, teak cutting boards and [[butcher blocks]] are often considered to result in less wear on knife blades. [[End grain]] cutting boards showcase the tree's natural rings and hide knife marks and wear. Other manufacturing styles, such as edge grain or face grain are generally more affordable thanks to the efficiency of their construction.

== Decking and lumber ==
Teak lumber and decking make up another prominent portion of Proteak's commercial offerings through it subsidiary Teakyard. Boards cut from teak logs exhibit an attractive golden or brown complexion with a tight grain pattern. Often used in the construction of boats, patios, and outdoor furniture, teak lumber is known for its ability to resist rot, warping and cracking.

[[Plantation teak]] lumber is also available at a significantly lower price than teak imported from Burma's old-growth forests. Likewise, it's often preferred by consumers who are looking for an ethical or environmentally friendly teak option for their construction project.

== Slow growth ==
"Slow growth" attempts to duplicate old-growth teak with the proper growing conditions. Proteak employs the slow growth process in the cultivation of its [[plantation teak]] by selecting plantation sites that mimic the soil and precipitation characteristics of [[Southeast Asia]].

Proteak produces its timber without the use of fertilizers or irrigation, both of which speed up the growth of the wood and alter the teak's famous grain pattern.

The '''quasispecies model''' is a description of the process of the Darwinian [[evolution]] of certain [[self-replication|self-replicating]] entities within the framework of [[physical chemistry]]. A quasispecies is a large group or "'''cloud'''" of related [[genotype]]s that exist in an environment of high mutation rate (at stationary state&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eigen|first=Manfred|last2=McCaskill|first2=John|last3=Schuster|first3=Peter|title=Molecular quasi-species|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100335a010|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|language=en|volume=92|issue=24|pages=6881–6891|doi=10.1021/j100335a010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002C-84A7-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;), where a large fraction of offspring are expected to contain one or more mutations relative to the parent.  This is in contrast to a [[species]], which from an evolutionary perspective is a more-or-less stable single genotype, most of the offspring of which will be genetically accurate copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Biebricher, C.K &amp; Eigen, M.|chapter=What is a Quasispecies|editor=Esteban Domingo|title=Quasispecies: Concept and Implications for Virology |publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=978-3-540-26395-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is useful mainly in providing a qualitative understanding of the evolutionary processes of self-replicating macromolecules such as [[RNA]] or [[DNA]] or simple asexual organisms such as [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[virus]]es (see also [[viral quasispecies]]), and is helpful in explaining something of the early stages of the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]]. Quantitative predictions based on this model are difficult because the parameters that serve as its input are impossible to obtain from actual biological systems. The quasispecies model was put forward by [[Manfred Eigen]] and [[Peter Schuster]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Eigen M, Schuster P |year=1979 |title=The Hypercycle: A Principle of Natural Self-Organization |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin |isbn=0-387-09293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on initial work done by Eigen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eigen |first=Manfred |date=October 1971 |title=Selforganization of matter and the evolution of biological macromolecules |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften |volume=58 |issue=10 |pages=465–523 |doi=10.1007/BF00623322 |pmid=4942363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simplified explanation==

When evolutionary biologists describe competition between species, they generally assume that each species is a single genotype whose descendants are mostly accurate copies.  (Such genotypes are said to have a high reproductive ''fidelity''.)  Evolutionarily, we are interested in the behavior and fitness of that one species or genotype over time.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Some organisms or genotypes, however, may exist in circumstances of low fidelity, where most descendants contain one or more mutations.  A group of such genotypes is constantly changing, so discussions of which single genotype is the most fit become meaningless.  Importantly, if many closely related genotypes are only one mutation away from each other, then genotypes in the group can mutate back and forth into each other.  For example, with one mutation per generation, a child of the sequence AGGT could be AGTT, and a grandchild could be AGGT again.  Thus we can envision a "'''cloud'''" of related genotypes that is rapidly mutating, with sequences going back and forth among different points in the cloud.  Though the proper definition is mathematical, that cloud, roughly speaking, is a quasispecies.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Quasispecies behavior exists for large numbers of individuals existing at a certain (high) range of mutation rates.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, MA, Martus G, Capel E, Parera M, Franco S, Nevot M (2012) Quasispecies Dynamics of RNA Viruses. In: Viruses: Essential Agents of Life, Springer, Dordrecht, pp. 21-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quasispecies, fitness, and evolutionary selection===
In a species, though reproduction may be mostly accurate, periodic mutations will give rise to one or more competing genotypes.  If a mutation results in greater replication and survival, the mutant genotype may out-compete the parent genotype and come to dominate the species.  Thus, the individual genotypes (or species) may be seen as the units on which selection acts and biologists will often speak of a single genotype's [[fitness (biology)|fitness]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In a quasispecies, however, mutations are ubiquitous and so the fitness of an individual genotype becomes meaningless: if one particular mutation generates a boost in reproductive success, it can't amount to much because that genotype's offspring are unlikely to be accurate copies with the same properties.  Instead, what matters is the ''connectedness'' of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Villarreal | first1 = L.P. | last2 = Witzany | first2 = G. | year = 2013 | title = Rethinking quasispecies theory: From fittest type to cooperative consortia | journal = World Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 70–79 | doi = 10.4331/wjbc.v4.i4.79 | pmid = 24340131 | pmc=3856310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the sequence AGGT has 12 (3+3+3+3) possible single point mutants AGGA, AGGG, and so on.  If 10 of those mutants are viable genotypes that may reproduce (and some of whose offspring or grandchildren may mutate back into AGGT again), we would consider that sequence a well-connected node in the cloud.  If instead only two of those mutants are viable, the rest being lethal mutations, then that sequence is poorly connected and most of its descendants will not reproduce. The analog of fitness for a quasispecies is the tendency of nearby relatives within the cloud to be well-connected, meaning that more of the mutant descendants will be viable and give rise to further descendants within the cloud.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

When the fitness of a single genotype becomes meaningless because of the high rate of mutations, the cloud as a whole or quasispecies becomes the natural unit of selection.

===Application to biological research===

Quasispecies represents the evolution of high-mutation-rate viruses such as [[HIV]] and sometimes single genes or molecules within the genomes of other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |last2=et. al. |year= |title=RNA virus populations as quasispecies |journal=Genetic Diversity of RNA Viruses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Domingo |first1=E. |year=2002 |title=Quasispecies theory in virology |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=76 |pages=463–465 |doi= 10.1128/jvi.76.1.463-465.2002|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/76/1/463.full|pmc=135734 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilke |year=2005 |title=Quasispecies theory in the context of population genetics |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=5 |pages=44 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-5-44 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/44|pmc=1208876 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasispecies models have also been proposed by Jose Fontanari and [[Emmanuel David Tannenbaum]] to model the evolution of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tannenbaum ED, Fontanari JF |year=2008 |title=A quasispecies approach to the evolution of sexual replication in unicellular organisms |journal=Theory Bioscience |volume=127 |pages=53–65 |doi=10.1007/s12064-008-0023-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quasispecies was also shown in compositional replicators (based on the [[Gard model]] for [[abiogenesis]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross |first1=R. |last2=Fouxon |first2=I. |last3=Lancet |first3=D. |last4=Markovitch |first4=O. |year=2014 |title=Quasispecies in population of compositional assemblies |journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=14 |pages=2623 |doi=10.1186/s12862-014-0265-1 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/2623/abstract |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102125325/http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/14/2623/abstract |archivedate=January 2, 2015 |pmid=25547629 |pmc=4357159}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also suggested to be applicable to describe cell's replication, which amongst other things requires the maintenance and evolution of the internal composition of the parent and bud.

==Formal background==

The model rests on four assumptions{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}:
# The self-replicating entities can be represented as sequences composed of a small number of building blocks—for example, sequences of RNA consisting of the four bases [[adenine]], [[guanine]], [[cytosine]], and [[uracil]].
# New sequences enter the system solely as the result of a copy process, either correct or erroneous, of other sequences that are already present.
# The substrates, or raw materials, necessary for ongoing replication are always present in sufficient quantity. Excess sequences are washed away in an outgoing flux.
# Sequences may decay into their building blocks. The probability of decay does not depend on the sequences' age; old sequences are just as likely to decay as young sequences.

In the quasispecies model, [[mutation]]s occur through errors made in the process of copying already existing sequences. Further, [[natural selection|selection]] arises because different types of sequences tend to replicate at different rates, which leads to the suppression of sequences that replicate more slowly in favor of sequences that replicate faster. However, the quasispecies model does not predict the ultimate extinction of all but the fastest replicating sequence. Although the sequences that replicate more slowly cannot sustain their abundance level by themselves, they are constantly replenished as sequences that replicate faster mutate into them. At equilibrium, removal of slowly replicating sequences due to decay or outflow is balanced by replenishing, so that even relatively slowly replicating sequences can remain present in finite abundance.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Due to the ongoing production of mutant sequences, selection does not act on single sequences, but on mutational "clouds" of closely related sequences, referred to as ''quasispecies''. In other words, the evolutionary success of a particular sequence depends not only on its own replication rate, but also on the replication rates of the mutant sequences it produces, and on the replication rates of the sequences of which it is a mutant. As a consequence, the sequence that replicates fastest may even disappear completely in selection-mutation equilibrium, in favor of more slowly replicating sequences that are part of a quasispecies with a higher average growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schuster P, Swetina J |date=November 1988 |title=Stationary mutant distributions and evolutionary optimization |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |volume=50 |issue=6  |pages=635–660 |issn=0092-8240 |doi=10.1007/BF02460094 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |location=Dordrecht |pmid=3219448}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mutational clouds as predicted by the quasispecies model have been observed in RNA viruses and in ''in vitro'' RNA replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Domingo E, Holland JJ |date=October 1997 |title=RNA virus mutations and fitness for survival |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=51 |pages=151–178  |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.51.1.151 |pmid=9343347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burch CL, Chao L |year=2000 |title=Evolvability of an RNA virus is determined by its mutational neighbourhood |journal=Nature |volume=406 |pages=625–628 |doi=10.1038/35020564 |pmid=10949302 |issue=6796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mutation rate and the general fitness of the molecular sequences and their neighbors is crucial to the formation of a quasispecies. If the mutation rate is zero, there is no exchange by mutation, and each sequence is its own species. If the mutation rate is too high, exceeding what is known as the [[Error threshold (evolution)|error threshold]], the quasispecies will break down and be dispersed over the entire range of available sequences.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Mathematical description==

A simple mathematical model for a quasispecies is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eigen|first=Manfred|last2=McCaskill|first2=John|last3=Schuster|first3=Peter|title=Molecular quasi-species|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/j100335a010|journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry|language=en|volume=92|issue=24|pages=6881–6891|doi=10.1021/j100335a010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002C-84A7-C}}&lt;/ref&gt; let there be  &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;  possible sequences and let there be &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; organisms with sequence ''i''. Let's say that each of these organisms asexually gives rise to &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; offspring. Some are duplicates of their parent, having sequence ''i'', but some are mutant and have some other sequence. Let the mutation rate &lt;math&gt;q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; correspond to the [[probability]] that a ''j'' type parent will produce an ''i'' type organism. Then the [[Expected value|expected]] fraction of offspring generated by ''j'' type organisms that would be ''i'' type organisms is &lt;math&gt;w_{ij}=A_j q_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\sum_i q_{ij}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

Then the total number of ''i''-type organisms after the first round of reproduction, given as &lt;math&gt;n'_i&lt;/math&gt;, is

:&lt;math&gt;n'_i=\sum_j w_{ij}n_j&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes a death rate term &lt;math&gt;D_i&lt;/math&gt; is included so that:

:&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}=A_j q_{ij}-D_i\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to 1 when i=j and is zero otherwise. Note that the ''n-th'' generation can be found by just taking the ''n-th'' power of '''W''' substituting it in place of '''W''' in the above formula.

This is just a [[system of linear equations]]. The usual way to solve such a system is to first [[Diagonalizable matrix|diagonalize]] the '''W''' matrix. Its diagonal entries will be [[eigenvalues]] corresponding to certain linear combinations of certain subsets of sequences which will be [[eigenvectors]] of the '''W''' matrix. These subsets of sequences are the quasispecies.  Assuming that the matrix '''W''' is a [[primitive matrix]] ([[Irreducibility (mathematics)|irreducible]] and [[Perron–Frobenius theorem|aperiodic]]), then after very many generations only the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue will prevail, and it is this quasispecies that will eventually dominate. The components of this eigenvector give the relative abundance of each sequence at equilibrium.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== Note about primitive matrices ===

'''W''' being primitive means that for some integer &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, that the &lt;math&gt;n^{th} &lt;/math&gt; power of '''W''' is &gt; 0, i.e. all the entries are positive.  If '''W''' is primitive then each type can, through a sequence of mutations (i.e. powers of '''W''') mutate into all the other types after some number of generations. '''W''' is not primitive if it is periodic, where the population can perpetually cycle through different disjoint sets of compositions, or if it is reducible, where the dominant species (or quasispecies) that develops can depend on the initial population, as is the case in the simple example given below.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Alternative formulations===

The quasispecies formulae may be expressed as a set of linear differential equations. If we consider the difference between the new state &lt;math&gt;n'_i&lt;/math&gt; and the old state &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; to be the state change over one moment of time, then we can state that the time derivative of &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt; is given by this difference,   &lt;math&gt;\dot{n}_i = n'_i-n_i&lt;/math&gt; we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{n}_i=\sum_j w_{ij}n_j-n_i&lt;/math&gt;

The quasispecies equations are usually expressed in terms of concentrations &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; where

:&lt;math&gt;x_i\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{n_i}{\sum_j n_j}&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;x'_i\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{n'_i}{\sum_j n'_j}&lt;/math&gt;.

The above equations for the quasispecies then become for the discrete version:

:&lt;math&gt;x'_i = \frac{\sum_j w_{ij}x_j}{\sum_{ij} w_{ij}x_j}&lt;/math&gt;

or, for the continuum version:

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_i =\sum_j w_{ij}x_j-x_i\sum_{ij}w_{ij}x_j.&lt;/math&gt;

===Simple example===
The quasispecies concept can be illustrated by a simple system consisting of 4 sequences. Sequences [0,0], [0,1], [1,0], and [1,1] are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Let's say the [0,0] sequence never mutates and always produces a single offspring. Let's say the other 3 sequences all produce, on average, &lt;math&gt;1-k&lt;/math&gt; replicas of themselves, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; of each of the other two types, where &lt;math&gt;0\le k\le 1&lt;/math&gt;. The '''W''' matrix is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;1-k&amp;k&amp;k\\
0&amp;k&amp;1-k&amp;k\\
0&amp;k&amp;k&amp;1-k
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

The diagonalized matrix is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{W'}=
\begin{bmatrix}
1-2k&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;1-2k&amp;0&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0\\
0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1+k
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

And the eigenvectors corresponding to these eigenvalues are:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
![[Eigenvalue]] !! [[Eigenvector]]
|-
|1-2k || [0,-1,0,1]
|-
| 1-2k || [0,-1,1,0]
|-
| 1 || [1,0,0,0]
|-
| 1+k || [0,1,1,1]
|}

Only the eigenvalue &lt;math&gt;1+k&lt;/math&gt; is more than unity. For the n-th generation, the corresponding eigenvalue will be &lt;math&gt;(1+k)^n&lt;/math&gt; and so will increase without bound as time goes by. This eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector [0,1,1,1], which represents the quasispecies consisting of sequences 2, 3, and 4, which will be present in equal numbers after a very long time. Since all population numbers must be positive,  the first two quasispecies are not legitimate. The third quasispecies consists of only the non-mutating sequence 1. It's seen that even though sequence 1 is the most fit in the sense that it reproduces more of itself than any other sequence, the quasispecies consisting of the other three sequences will eventually dominate (assuming that the initial population was not homogeneous of the sequence 1 type).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In [[information technology]] a '''reasoning system''' is a [[software system]] that generates conclusions from available [[knowledge]] using [[logic]]al techniques such as [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Reasoning systems play an important role in the implementation of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge-based systems]].

By the everyday usage definition of the phrase, all computer systems are reasoning systems in that they all automate some type of logic or decision. In typical use in the [[Information Technology]] field however, the phrase is usually reserved for systems that perform more complex kinds of reasoning. For example, not for systems that do fairly straightforward types of reasoning such as calculating a sales tax or customer discount but making logical inferences about a medical diagnosis or mathematical theorem. Reasoning systems come in two modes: interactive and batch processing. Interactive systems interface with the user to ask clarifying questions or otherwise allow the user to guide the reasoning process. Batch systems take in all the available information at once and generate the best answer possible without user feedback or guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wos|first1=Larry|last2=Owerbeek|first2=Ross|last3=Ewing|first3=Lusk|last4=Boyle|first4=Jim|title=Automated Reasoning: Introductions and Applications|date=1984|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-054453-1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasoning systems have a wide field of application that includes [[Scheduling (production processes)|scheduling]], [[Business rules approach|business rule processing]], [[problem solving]], [[complex event processing]], [[intrusion detection]], [[predictive analytics]], [[robotics]], [[computer vision]], and [[natural language processing]].

==History==
The first reasoning systems were theorem provers, systems that represent axioms and statements in First Order Logic and then use rules of logic such as [[modus ponens]] to infer new statements. Another early type of reasoning system were general problem solvers. These were systems such as the [[General Problem Solver]] designed by [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herb Simon|Simon]]. General problem solvers attempted to provide a generic planning engine that could represent and solve structured problems. They worked by decomposing problems into smaller more manageable sub-problems, solving each sub-problem and assembling the partial answers into one final answer. Another example general problem solver was the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|SOAR]] family of systems.

In practice these theorem provers and general problem solvers were seldom useful for practical applications and required specialized users with knowledge of logic to utilize. The first practical application of [[automated reasoning]] were [[expert system]]s. Expert systems focused on much more well defined domains than general problem solving such as medical diagnosis or analyzing faults in an aircraft. Expert systems also focused on more limited implementations of logic. Rather than attempting to implement the full range of logical expressions they typically focused on modus-ponens implemented via IF-THEN rules. Focusing on a specific domain and allowing only a restricted subset of logic improved the performance of such systems so that they were practical for use in the real world and not merely as research demonstrations as most previous automated reasoning systems had been. The engine used for automated reasoning in expert systems were typically called [[inference engine]]s. Those used for more general logical inferencing are typically called [[Automated theorem provers|theorem provers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayes-Roth|first=Frederick|title=Building Expert Systems|year=1983|publisher=AddisonWesley|isbn=0-201-10686-8|first2=Donald|last2=Waterman|first3=Douglas| last3=Lenat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise in popularity of expert systems many new types of automated reasoning were applied to diverse problems in government and industry. Some such as case-based reasoning were off shoots of expert systems research. Others such as constraint satisfaction algorithms were also influenced by fields such as decision technology and linear programming. Also, a completely different approach, one not based on symbolic reasoning but on a connectionist model has also been extremely productive. This latter type of automated reasoning is especially well suited to pattern matching and signal detection types of problems such as text searching and face matching.

==Use of logic==
The term reasoning system can be used to apply to just about any kind of sophisticated decision system as illustrated by the specific areas described below. However, the most common use of the term reasoning system implies the computer representation of logic.  Various implementations demonstrate significant variation in terms of [[Formal system|systems of logic]] and formality. Most reasoning systems implement variations of [[Propositional calculus|propositional]] and [[Symbolic logic|symbolic]] ([[Predicate logic|predicate]]) logic.  These variations may be mathematically precise representations of formal logic systems (e.g., [[First-order logic|FOL]]), or extended and [[Hybrid logic|hybrid]] versions of those systems (e.g., Courteous logic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Benjamin N. |last=Grosof |title=Courteous Logic Programs: Prioritized Conflict Handling For Rules |date=30 December 1997 |work=IBM Research Report |id=RC 20836 (92273) |url=http://www.research.ibm.com/iagents/paps/rc20836.ps |format=Postscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;).   Reasoning systems may explicitly implement additional logic types (e.g., [[Modal logic|modal]], [[Deontic logic|deontic]], [[Temporal logic|temporal]] logics).  However, many reasoning systems implement imprecise and semi-formal approximations to recognised logic systems.  These systems typically support a variety of procedural and semi-[[Declarative programming|declarative]] techniques in order to model different reasoning strategies.  They emphasise pragmatism over formality and may depend on custom extensions and attachments in order to solve real-world problems.

Many reasoning systems employ [[deductive reasoning]] to draw [[inference]]s from available knowledge.  These inference engines support forward reasoning or backward reasoning to infer conclusions via [[modus ponens]].   The [[Recursion|recursive]] reasoning methods they employ are termed ‘[[forward chaining]]’ and ‘[[backward chaining]]’, respectively. Although reasoning systems widely support deductive inference, some systems employ [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]], [[Defeasible reasoning|defeasible]] and other types of reasoning. [[Heuristic]]s may also be employed to determine acceptable solutions to [[Computational complexity theory#Intractability|intractable problems]].

Reasoning systems may employ the [[closed world assumption]] (CWA) or [[open world assumption]] (OWA).  The OWA is often associated with [[Ontology|ontological]] knowledge representation and the [[Semantic Web]].   Different systems exhibit a variety of approaches to [[negation]].  As well as [[Logical complement|logical]] or [[bitwise complement]], systems may support existential forms of strong and weak negation including [[Negation as failure|negation-as-failure]] and ‘inflationary’ negation (negation of non-[[Ground expression|ground atoms]]).   Different reasoning systems may support [[Monotonic function#Monotonic logic|monotonic]] or [[Non-monotonic logic|non-monotonic]] reasoning, [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratification]] and other logical techniques.

==Reasoning under uncertainty==

Many reasoning systems provide capabilities for reasoning under [[uncertainty]]. This is important when building [[situated]] [[Distributed Multi-Agent Reasoning System|reasoning agents]] which must deal with uncertain representations of the world.  There are several common approaches to handling uncertainty.  These include the use of certainty factors, [[Probability|probabilistic]] methods such as [[Bayesian inference]] or [[Dempster–Shafer theory]], multi-valued (‘[[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]]’) logic and various [[Connectionism|connectionist]] approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Yoram |last1=Moses |first2=Moshe Y |last2=Vardi |first3=Ronald |last3=Fagin |first4=Joseph Y |last4=Halpern |title=Reasoning About Knowledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xHmlRamoszMC |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-56200-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of reasoning system==

This section provides a non-exhaustive and informal categorisation of common types of reasoning system.  These categories are not absolute.  They overlap to a significant degree and share a number of techniques, methods and [[algorithm]]s.

===Constraint solvers===
Constraint solvers solve [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s (CSPs).  They support [[constraint programming]].  A [[Constraint (information theory)|constraint]] is a condition which must be met by any valid [[Problem solving|solution to a problem]].  Constraints are defined declaratively and applied to [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] within given domains.  Constraint solvers use [[Search algorithm|search]], [[backtracking]] and [[Local consistency|constraint propagation]] techniques to find solutions and determine optimal solutions.  They may employ forms of [[Linear programming|linear]] and [[nonlinear programming]].  They are often used to perform [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] within highly [[Combinatorics|combinatorial]] problem spaces.  For example, they may be used to calculate optimal scheduling, design efficient [[integrated circuit]]s or maximise productivity in a manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Schalkoff |title=Intelligent Systems: Principles, Paradigms and Pragmatics: Principles, Paradigms and Pragmatics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80FXUtF5kRoC |year=2011 |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-8017-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theorem provers===
[[Automated theorem proving|Theorem provers]] use [[automated reasoning]] techniques to determine [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] of mathematical theorems.  They may also be used to verify existing proofs.  In addition to academic use, typical applications of theorem provers include verification of the correctness of integrated circuits, software programs, engineering designs, etc.

===Logic programs===
[[Logic programming|Logic programs]] (LPs) are [[Computer program|software programs]] written using [[programming language]]s whose [[Language primitive|primitives]] and [[Expression (programming)|expressions]] provide direct representations of constructs drawn from mathematical logic.  An example of a general-purpose logic programming language is [[Prolog]].  LPs represent the direct application of logic programming to solve problems.   Logic programming is characterised by highly declarative approaches based on formal logic, and has wide application across many disciplines.

===Rule engines===
[[Business rules engine|Rule engines]] represent conditional logic as discrete rules.  Rule sets can be managed and applied separately to other functionality.  They have wide applicability across many domains.  Many rule engines implement reasoning capabilities.  A common approach is to implement [[Production system (computer science)|production system]]s to support forward or backward chaining.  Each rule (‘production’) binds a conjunction of [[Clause|predicate clauses]] to a list of executable actions.  At run-time, the rule engine matches productions against facts and executes (‘fires’) the associated action list for each match.  If those actions remove or modify any facts, or assert new facts, the engine immediately re-computes the set of matches.  Rule engines are widely used to model and apply [[business rule]]s, to control [[Decision making|decision-making]] in automated processes and to enforce business and technical policies.

===Deductive classifier===
[[Deductive classifier]]s arose slightly later than rule-based systems and were a component of a new type of artificial intelligence knowledge representation tool known as [[frame language]]s. A frame language describes the problem domain as a set of classes, subclasses, and relations among the classes. It is similar to the [[Object-oriented analysis and design|object-oriented]] model. Unlike object-oriented models however, frame languages have a formal semantics based on first order logic. They utilize this semantics to provide input to the deductive classifier. The classifier in turn can analyze a given model (known as an [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]]) and determine if the various relations described in the model are consistent. If the ontology is not consistent the classifier will highlight the declarations that are inconsistent. If the ontology is consistent the classifier can then do further reasoning and draw additional conclusions about the relations of the objects in the ontology. For example, it may determine that an object is actually a subclass or instance of additional classes as those described by the user. Classifiers are an important technology in analyzing the ontologies used to describe models in the [[Semantic web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|accessdate=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|first2=James|last2=Hendler|first3=Ora|last3=Lassila|title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities|journal=Scientific American|date=May 17, 2001|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34|volume=284|pages=34–43|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html|archivedate=April 24, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Machine learning systems===
[[Machine learning]] systems evolve their behavior over time based on [[experience]].   This may involve reasoning over observed events or example data provided for training purposes.  For example, machine learning systems may use [[inductive reasoning]] to generate [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] for observed facts.  Learning systems search for generalised rules or functions that yield results in line with observations and then use these generalisations to control future behavior.

===Case-based reasoning systems===
[[Case-based reasoning]] (CBR) systems provide solutions to problems by analysing similarities to other problems for which known solutions already exist.  They use [[Analogy|analogical]] reasoning to infer solutions based on case histories.  CBR systems are commonly used in customer/[[technical support]] and [[call centre]] scenarios and have applications in [[Manufacturing|industrial manufacture]], [[agriculture]], [[medicine]], [[law]] and many other areas.

===Procedural reasoning systems===
A [[Procedural Reasoning System|procedural reasoning system]] (PRS) uses reasoning techniques to select [[plan]]s from a [[procedural knowledge]] base.  Each plan represents a course of action for achievement of a given [[goal]].  The PRS implements a [[Belief-Desire-Intention software model|belief-desire-intention model]] by reasoning over facts (‘[[belief]]s’) to select appropriate plans (‘[[intention]]s’) for given goals (‘desires’).  Typical applications of PRS include management, monitoring and [[Fault detection and isolation|fault detection]] systems.

[[Twitterbot]]s are already well-known examples, but corresponding [[autonomous agent]]s on [[Facebook]] and elsewhere have also been observed. Nowadays, social bots can generate convincing [[internet persona]]s that are well capable of influencing real people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[First Monday (journal)|First Monday]]|title=Social bots distort the 2016 U.S. Presidential election online discussion |author=Alessandro Bessi and Emilio Ferrara|date=2016-11-07|url=http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/7090/5653}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtarget"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/socialbot|publisher=whatis.techtarget.com|title=What is socialbot? - Definition from WhatIs.com|accessdate=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RiseOfSocialBots" /&gt; although they are not always reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/36619546/china-kills-ai-chatbots-after-they-start-criticising-communism/#page1 China kills AI chatbots after they start praising US, criticising communists] Yahoo! News August 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Social bots, besides being able to produce messages autonomously, also share many traits with [[spambot]]s with respect to their tendency to infiltrate large user groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Ferrara |first=Emilio |eprint=1708.08134 |title=Measuring social spam and the effect of bots on information diffusion in social media |year=2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using social bots is against the terms of service of many platforms, especially Twitter &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-automation|title=Automation rules|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Instagram &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/about/legal/terms/before-january-19-2013/|title=Terms of Use • Instagram|website=www.instagram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However many users, especially businesses still automate their Instagram activity in order to gain real followers rather than buying fake ones. This is commonly done through third-party social automation companies.

Unless strict regulations on their use are passed, socialbots are expected to play a major role in future shaping of [[public opinion]] by autonomously acting as incessant and never-tiring [[influencer marketing|influencers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How robots could shape Germany's political future|publisher=The Local|date=21 November 2016|url=http://www.thelocal.de/20161121/social-bots-robots-germany-elections-future|quote="Social Bots" were the sinister cyber friend in the US elections who didn't actually exist.

==Uses==

*foster [[Notability|fame]]: having an arbitrary number of (unrevealed) bots as (fake) followers can help simulate real success
*[[spamming]]: having advertising bots in online chats is similar to email spam, but a lot more direct
*[[mischief]]: e.g. signing up an opponent with a lot of fake identities and spam the account or help others discover it to discreditize the opponent
*[[bias]] [[public opinion]]: influence [[Fad|trends]] by countless messages of similar content with different phrasings
*limit [[free speech]]: important messages can be pushed out of sight by a deluge of automated bot messages
The effects of all points can be likened to and support methods of traditional [[psychological warfare]].

==Detection==
The first generation of bots could sometimes be distinguished from real users by their often [[superhuman]] capacities to post messages around the clock (and at massive rates).

'''Social position''' is the position of an [[individual]] in a given [[society]] and [[culture]]. A given position (for example, the occupation of ''[[priest]]'') may belong to many individuals. Social position influences [[social status]].

Social positions an individual may hold fall into the categories of [[employment|occupation]] (medical doctor, academic lecturer), [[profession]] (member of associations and organisations), [[family]] (parent, sibling, etc.), [[hobby]] (member of various clubs and organisations), among others. An individual is likely to create a personal [[hierarchy]] of such positions, where one will be a central position while the rest are peripheral positions.

Social positions are ''visible'' if they require an individual to wear a [[uniform]] or some other kind of identifying mark. Often individual clothes or other attributes will advertise what social position one has at the moment. Non-visible social positions are called ''hidden''. A position that is deemed the most important to a given individual is called ''central'', others are ''peripheral''. If a ''sequence of positions'' is required to obtain a given position, it can be defined as a [[career]], and a change of position in this context is a [[promotion (rank)|promotion]] or [[demotion]]. Some social positions may make it easier for a given person to obtain others; in other cases, some positions may be restricted to individuals meeting specific criteria.

Social position together with [[social role]] determines an individual's place in the [[social environment]] and [[social organisation]]. A group of social positions will create a [[social class]] and a [[social circle]].

A [[social conflict]] caused by interference between social positions is called a ''position conflict''.

==Research==

The sociological term for social position is a way of identifying a person's position within the [[social hierarchy]] in a society.

=== Subjective social position ===

Subjective social position refers to an individual's perceived social position in a social hierarchy. According to Kristina Lindemann the individual objective characteristics like education, occupation and income are related with the subjective social position.&lt;ref name="lindemann"/&gt; In addition, the culture and society that a person lives and grows in, heavily impacts an individual’s subjective social position.  "An individual's subjective social position status depends not only on the objective characteristics but also on how people experience society, the way they perceive their position in comparison with others,and what they imagine their position would be in the future."&lt;ref name="lindemann"&gt;
Lindemann, Kristina. "The Impact of Objective Characteristics on Subjective Social Position." Trames 11 (2007): 54-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Lindemann divides objective characteristics into two groups, ascribed and achieved characteristics.  Ascribed characteristics are things like age, gender, and ethnicity.  Achieved characteristics are things like the education level, occupation, or income. Studies have indicated a significant relevance of these characteristics to an individual’s subjective social position.

On the other hand, some theories expect that objective characteristics do not have influence on subjective social position. The reference group theory mentioned by Lindemann in her essay states that people see the world as an enlarged version of their [[reference group]].  People base their social position upon the people around them. Typically people’s family, friends, and co-workers are usually very similar, and in general, most people see themselves as average and unexceptional. The status maximizing process also mentioned by Lindemann means that subjective social position reflects also person prospects and hopes for future societal attainment.

Lindemann’s empirical study focuses on Estonian society. Age is considered an impactful characteristic on people when identifying with their social position in Estonia. Young people give higher estimation to their social position, which is a tendency also found in other Eastern European countries. Gender and ethnicity, are also considerable characteristics in identifying social position.  In general, the subjective social position of men and women is not significantly different in western countries.  [[Ethnicity]] impacts social position differently from [[country]] to country.  More importantly the influence of ethnicity is closely related to the extent [[ethnic minorities]] are accepted by the overall society.&lt;ref name="lindemann"/&gt;

Different studies have shown that the effect of income on class identification in particular has increased during the last decades in Western countries. In Estonia, the income is the most important determinant that shapes people opinion of their social position. The increased influence of income on the subjective social position can be explained by the rise of consumer society values. In her studies Lindemann also found that occupation and education influence significantly the subjective social position.  As expected, managers and professionals and higher educated people identify with the middle or higher strata, while unskilled workers and low educated people relate with the lower positions in social hierarchy.&lt;ref name="lindemann"/&gt;

In several studies, researchers have assessed Individuals' perceived social position using the single-item MacArthur scale of subjective social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Relationship of subjective and objective social status with psychological and physiological functioning: Preliminary data in healthy, White women.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0278-6133.19.6.586|journal = Health Psychology|pages = 586–592|volume = 19|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.19.6.586|first = Nancy E.|last = Adler|first2 = Elissa S.|last2 = Epel|first3 = Grace|last3 = Castellazzo|first4 = Jeannette R.|last4 = Ickovics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changes in self-rated health and subjective social status over time in a cohort of healthcare personnel|url = http://hpq.sagepub.com/content/19/9/1185|journal = Journal of Health Psychology|date = 2014-09-01|issn = 1359-1053|pmid = 23682064|pages = 1185–1196|volume = 19|issue = 9|doi = 10.1177/1359105313485486|first = Mark G.|last = Thompson|first2 = Manjusha J.|last2 = Gaglani|first3 = Allison|last3 = Naleway|first4 = Swathi|last4 = Thaker|first5 = Sarah|last5 = Ball}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MacArthur scale of subjective social status is a drawing of a ten-rung ladder presented as the distribution of individuals in a social hierarchy. People with the highest salaries, best ranked jobs and highest education levels are depicted as standing on the upper rungs of the ladder, whereas those with the lowest salaries, poorest jobs, and lowest education levels are those who stand at the bottom of the ladder.

=== Social class ===
{{Main|Social class}}
A [[social class]] (or, simply, class), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the [[social sciences]] and [[political theory]] centered on models of [[social stratification]] in which people are grouped into a set of [[Dominance hierarchy|hierarchical]] social categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Grant, J. Andrew |chapter=class, definition of |editor=Jones, R.J. Barry |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries A-F |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-24350-6 |page=161 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a29qBofx8Y8C&amp;pg=PA161}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most common being the [[upper class|upper]], [[middle class|middle]], and [[working class|lower classes]].

Class is a subject of analysis for [[List of sociologists|sociologists]], [[political scientist]]s, [[anthropologists]], and [[social history|social historians]]. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of  "class", and the term has a wide range of  sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term "social class" is usually synonymous with "[[Socioeconomic status|socio-economic]] class", defined as "people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status", e.g., "the [[working class]]"; "an emerging professional class".&lt;ref&gt;Princeton University. [http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=social+class&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o8=1&amp;o1=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o9=&amp;o6=&amp;o3=&amp;o4=&amp;h=0 "Social class"]. WordNet Search 3.1. Retrieved on: 2012-01-25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, academics distinguish social class and socioeconomic status, with the former referring to one’s relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter referring to one’s current social and economic situation and, consequently, being more changeable over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3102/0013189X14528373 |authors=Rubin, M., Denson, N., Kilpatrick, S., Matthews, K. E., Stehlik, T., &amp; Zyngier, D. |year=2014 |title="I am working-class": Subjective self-definition as a missing measure of social class and socioeconomic status in higher education research |work=Educational Researcher |volume=43 |pages=196–200 |doi=10.3102/0013189X14528373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time.  [[Karl Marx]] thought "class" was defined  by one's relationship to the [[means of production]] (their [[relations of production]]). His simple understanding of classes in modern [[Capitalism|capitalist society]], are the [[proletariat]], those who work but do not own the means of production; and the [[bourgeoisie]], those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the former. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist [[Max Weber]], who argued "class" is determined by economic position, in contrast to "[[social status]]" or "''Stand''"&lt;!--German term, could be confused with English word, so italics needed--&gt; which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max (1921/2015). "Classes, Stände, Parties" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society: New Translations on Politics, Bureaucracy and Social Stratification.  Edited and Translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 37–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "class" is etymologically derived from the Latin ''classis'', which was used by [[census]] takers to categorize citizens by wealth, in order to determine military service obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, D.F. |chapter=Social class and Status |editor=Mey, Jacob |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Pragmatics |publisher=Elsevier |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-08-096297-9 |page=952 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GcmXgeBE7k0C&amp;pg=PA952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 18th century, the term "class" began to replace classifications such as [[Estates of the realm|estate]]s, [[nobility|rank]], and [[religious order|order]]s as the primary means of organizing society into hierarchical divisions. This corresponded to a general decrease in significance ascribed to hereditary characteristics, and increase in the significance of wealth and [[income]] as indicators of position in the social hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Class, Social |editor=Kuper, Adam |title=The social science encyclopedia|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-415-32096-2 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2oES3pJufP4C&amp;pg=PA111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Penney, Robert |chapter=Class, social|editors=Christensen, Karen &amp; Levinson, David |title=Encyclopedia of community: from the village to the virtual world, Volume 1 |publisher=SAGE |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7619-2598-9 |page=189 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human capital ===
{{Main|Human capital}}

One way to change one's social position is to increase human capital.  The human capital theory suggest that people having more job-relevant resources, such as education and training, should receive more organizational rewards i.e. promotions than people with fewer of these resources.  Human capital alone can affect social position to a certain extent.  An individual has to have social skills and build social networks to help promote their social position.&lt;ref name="james"&gt;James, Erika H. "Race Related Differences in Promotions and Support." Organization Science 11.5 (2000): 493-508.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social capital ===
{{Main|Social capital}}

Another way to effectively increase one's chance of obtaining or sustaining social position is by increasing [[social capital]].  The social capital theory posits that certain qualities in workplace relationships are beneficial for receiving organizational rewards, and employees whose relationships are not characterized by these qualities are at a disadvantage.&lt;ref name="james" /&gt; In other words, people who have social relationships with upper management might get to know about a promotion possibility before someone lacking in the social capital infrastructure that relays that sort of information.

Erika James finds through studies and analysis that in general blacks have been promoted at a slower pace than whites.  This workplace discrimination occurred most likely because of unequal human/social capital between the two races.  Clearly this is not a justification for the actions to occur.  The issue of race still exists as a statistically proven factor in American job markets.

=== Trust ===
{{Main|Trust (social sciences)}}

For an individual to hold a social position thoroughly and knowledgeably they must be trusted in the{{Which|date=February 2011}} [[Market (economics)|market]] and reflect it in their behavior. Paul S. Adler says that a review of trends in [[employment relations]], interdivisional relations, and interfirm relations finds evidence suggesting that the effect of growing knowledge-intensity may indeed be a trend toward greater reliance on trust.  He believes the form of trust that is most effective in this context is of a distinctively modern kind - "reflective trust"  - as opposed to traditionalistic, "blind" trust.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;Adler, Paul S. "Market, Hierarchy, and Trust: The Knowledge Economy and the Future of Capitalism" ''Organization Science'' 12.2 (2001): 215-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

The values at work in modern trust are those of the scientific community: "universalism, communism, disinterestedness, organized skepticism" (Merton 1973, p.&amp;nbsp;270). Modern trust is inclusive and open. The author concludes that the efficacy of trust for knowledge management and the likelihood of its growth over time are maximized if:

# Trust is balanced by hierarchical rules to ensure stability and equity
# Trust is balanced by market competition to ensure flexibility and opportunity
# Trust is modern and reflective rather than traditionalistic and blind

There is an element of trust necessary within society and for identifying with a particular social position - especially relevant to particular community positions where one's actions weigh heavily on one's social position.&lt;ref name=Adler /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23523">A '''Student Bill of Rights''' or Charter of Student Rights and Freedoms is a document adopted by a student group, university or college or government at a local, state or national level. It outlines a population's basic beliefs regarding student rights. These statements of belief are often the foundation for future legislative efforts or collaborative efforts to create joint statements between organizations. The [[European Student Union]], for example, uses their Student Rights Charter when lobbying for student rights in the European Union Higher Education Area as a document representing the student will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esu-online.org/news/article/6064/97/ European Student Union] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926185642/http://www.esu-online.org/news/article/6064/97/ |date=2012-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The historic [[National Student Association]] in the United States used their Student Bill of Rights to help create dialogue between the [[American Association of University Professors]] and to initiate the creation of a joint statement on student rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaup.org/aaup/pubsres/policydocs/contents/stud-rights.htm American Association of University Professors]&lt;/ref&gt; This collaborative effort gave credence to the demands of students and helped normalize student rights on campuses across North America. While the [[United States Student Association]] does not have a student bill of rights of its own, it upholds the 1947 student bill of rights put forth by the National Student Association.&lt;ref&gt;United States Student Association http://www.usstudents.org/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

These documents tend to do several things. They can be statements of belief, policy or law. When put forth by a student organization or third party organization they tend to be statements of belief because these organizations do not often have the ability to enforce their beliefs. Even though they are not legally binding they are important because they help policy and lawmakers understand what students expect and believe to be ethical treatment. At the institutional level they tend to be policy statements. These are legally binding as a promise from the institution to the students who attend and have been found in court to be considered to be part of the educational contract.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan and Lee (2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

At any level these documents provide students with an understanding of their civil or legal rights which are already contained in legislation. These include rights pertinent to all citizens and also to students in the educational setting and provide procedural rights to inform students how institutions should be respecting their legal rights. When used as a statement of belief, however, they often include rights an organization feels students should have and the procedural rights institutions must follow to ensure these rights are fulfilled. There are currently a number of student petitions calling for the creation of national student bills in various countries. While there have been some attempts to create subject specific student bills in the United States, like the Academic Bill of Rights, these have not been successful due primarily for demand for a document which is wider in scope and deals with students constitutional, civil, contractual and consumer rights.

==North American Student Bills==
No country in North America has yet adopted a National Student Bill of Rights, Charter of Rights and Freedoms or Code of Rights and Responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Occupy Education http://www.facebook.com/occupycollege&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;navigatehighered.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===

====American National Student Bills====
In the United States there have been several national student bill of rights drafted by student organizations including the historic National Student Association and the American Association of University Professors and other non-governmantal organizations but as yet none have been legally institutionalized.

====National Student Association (NSA)====
In 1947 the National Student Association NSA in the United States adopted a student bill of rights. The text of this document is not easily accessible.  In 1967, however, the NSA put forth a joint statement on the rights and freedoms of students with the American Association of University Professors AAUP (now the Association of American Colleges and Universities). This statement was endorsed by a number of professional organizations. This document included the following rights:

Constitutional Rights
# Exercise of rights of citizenship
# Freedom of association
# Right to due process
Speech and Association Rights
# Student participation in institutional government
# Student publications
Due Process Rights
# Standards for investigation of student conduct
## Investigation of student conduct
## Hearings for student conduct
Classroom Rights
# Protection of freedom of inquiry and expression
# Protection from improper academic evaluation
# Protection from improper student information disclosure&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaup.org/aaup/pubsres/policydocs/contents/stud-rights.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States Student Association====
The United States Student Association does not have an official student bill of rights. The USSA was formed when the historic NSA merged with the National Student Lobby NSL in 1978. They did not officially adopt the student bill of rights put forth in 1947. They text of this document is not on their website and cannot easily be found with a search of the internet.

====2003 Academic Bill of Rights====
In 2003, Georgia Congressman Kingston proposed the first national student bill of rights, House Bill #318. This bill, which was rejected in congress, was not an all encompassing student bill of rights but was narrowly defined to address academic freedom. Nevertheless, it was the first attempt at the creation of national legislation. The congressman found that "at almost every American university, conservative professors are drastically outnumbered." This bill was intended to secure the intellectual freedom of students and faculty. It did not address whether teachers would have the freedom to determine all course goals, curriculum, assignments, grading schemes and course timeline. These issues are of major importance because students in Europe are calling for rights which protect students from teachers having complete academic freedom in the classroom and which regulate them to ensure students have minimum educational quality standards.&lt;ref name="navigatehighered.weebly"&gt;http://navigatehighered.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/7/5/12753485/student_code_-_still_editing2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Institutional Student Bills===
In the United States individual institutions often have their own Student Bill of Rights, Charter of Rights and Freedoms or Code of Rights and Responsibilities. In elementary and secondary education these codes are often drafted by school board officials with perhaps the input of parent or parent teacher associations. In post secondary institutions these are often drafted by the academic senate with the contribution of student representatives. This process often includes varying degrees of student input from student surveys to no student voice and the academic senate may have as much as 50% student representation or as little as 0% student representation depending on the structure of the institution.

===Canada===

====Canadian Federation of Students====
The [[Canadian Federation of Students]] has yet to accept a student bill or rights, code of rights and responsibilities or a charter of rights and freedoms. The Canadian Encyclopedia, which details issues of Canadian life and governance, however, states that in Canada  "Basically 2 sorts of rights apply to students: substantive rights - the actual rights that students should enjoy - and procedural rights - methods by which students claim their rights. This article is concerned with students in public institutions, although those in private schools can claim rights under the common law and provincial education Acts."

====Declaration on the Canadian Student====
In the 1960s, the [[Canadian Union of Students]] had adopted the Declaration on the Canadian Student, a declaration aimed defining the rights and role of a student. The Declaration was adopted at the September 1965 annual meeting of the CUS, and was initiated mainly by the [[Student Federation of the University of Ottawa|Students' Union of the University of Ottawa]] President [[Jock Turcot]].&lt;ref&gt;La Rotonde. L’AGÉUO définit l’étudiant canadien. Published 22 September 1965&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the CUS re-affirmed the "fundamental philosophy" behind the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.studentunion.ca/2013/07/the-declaration-of-the-canadian-student/&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Student Bills==

===European Student Union===
In 2008 the European Student Union adopted a Student Rights Charter &lt;ref name="esu-online"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esu-online.org/news/article/6064/97/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926185642/http://www.esu-online.org/news/article/6064/97/ |archivedate=2012-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is in essence their platform. This document includes those rights and freedoms which members of the European student Union are lobbying for in their own countries. Romania currently has the strongest student rights legislation in the European Union and this is in part to do with the efforts of the European Student Union to press for legislation.&lt;ref name="esu-online" /&gt; The 2008 ESU Student Rights Charter includes the following rights:

===European National Country Level Student Bills===

====Germany====

====Romania====
Romania is the country which has the greatest student rights legislation currently in place. In 2010 the National Alliance of student organizations in Romania, which is also part of the European Student Union, and the Romanian Students' Union(USR) worked with the Romanian National Government to bring into law the Romanian National Student Code of Rights and Responsibilities.

Copenhagen 1811, in Danish, printed by Johan Frederik Schulz. In Kirstine Meyer's 1920 edition of Ørsted's works, vol.'''III''' pp. 151-190. ) "First Introduction to Physics: the Spirit, Meaning, and Goal of Natural Science". Reprinted in German in 1822, Schweigger's ''Journal für Chemie und Physik'' '''36''', pp. 458–488, as translated in {{harvnb|Ørsted|1997|pp=296–298}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[principle]] for the purpose of [[thinking]] through its consequences. Given the structure of the [[experiment]], it may not be possible to perform it, and even if it could be performed, there need not be an intention to perform it.

The common goal of a thought experiment is to explore the potential consequences of the principle in question:
::"A thought experiment is a device with which one performs an intentional, structured process of intellectual deliberation in order to speculate, within a specifiable problem domain, about potential consequents (or antecedents) for a designated antecedent (or consequent)" (Yeates, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;150).

Examples of thought experiments include [[Schrödinger's cat]], illustrating [[quantum indeterminacy]] through the manipulation of a perfectly sealed environment and a tiny bit of [[radioactive]] substance, and [[Maxwell's demon]], which attempts to demonstrate the ability of a hypothetical finite being to violate the [[second law of thermodynamics|2nd law of thermodynamics]].

== Overview ==
The ancient Greek '''δείκνυμι''' ''([[Transliteration|transl.]]: deiknymi)'', or thought experiment, "was the most ancient pattern of [[mathematical proof]]", and existed before Euclidean mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Szábo, Árpád. (1958) " 'Deiknymi' als Mathematischer Terminus fur 'Beweisen' ", ''Maia'' N.S. '''10''' pp. 1–26 as cited by [[Imre Lakatos]] (1976) in ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'' p.9. (John Worrall and Elie Zahar, eds.) Cambridge University Press {{ISBN|0-521-21078-X}}. The English translation of the title of Szábo's article is "'Deiknymi' as a mathematical expression for 'to prove'", as translated by [http://cimm.ucr.ac.cr/ciaem/articulos/historia/filo/%C3%81rpad%20zs%C3%A1bo%20and%20imre%20lakatos,%20or%20the%20relation%20between%20history%20and%20philosophy%20of%20mathematics.*M%C3%A1t%C3%A9,%20Andr%C3%A1s.*Lakatos.pdf András Máté] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425231500/http://cimm.ucr.ac.cr/ciaem/articulos/historia/filo/%C3%81rpad%20zs%C3%A1bo%20and%20imre%20lakatos,%20or%20the%20relation%20between%20history%20and%20philosophy%20of%20mathematics.*M%C3%A1t%C3%A9,%20Andr%C3%A1s.*Lakatos.pdf |date=2012-04-25 }}, p.285&lt;/ref&gt; where the emphasis was on the conceptual, rather than on the experimental part of a thought-experiment. Perhaps the key experiment in the history of modern science is [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s demonstration that falling objects must fall at the same rate regardless of their masses. This is widely thought&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Martin, "Wittgenstein's Beetle and Other Classic Thought Experiments", Blackwell, (Oxford), 2005, pp. 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  to have been a straightforward physical demonstration, involving climbing up the Leaning Tower of Pisa and dropping two heavy  weights off it, whereas in fact, it was a logical demonstration, using the 'thought experiment' technique. The 'experiment' is described by Galileo in ''[[Two New Sciences|Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche]]'' (1638) (literally, 'Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations') thus:

{{quote|''Salviati''. If then we take two bodies whose natural speeds are different, it is clear that on uniting the two, the more rapid one will be partly retarded by the slower, and the slower will be somewhat hastened by the swifter. Do you not agree with me in this opinion?

''Simplicio''. You are unquestionably right.

''Salviati''. But if this is true, and if a large stone moves with a speed of, say, eight while a smaller moves with a speed of four, then when they are united, the system will move with a speed less than eight; but the two stones when tied together make a stone larger than that which before moved with a speed of eight. Hence the heavier body moves with less speed than the lighter; an effect which is contrary to your supposition. Thus you see how, from your assumption that the heavier body moves more rapidly than the lighter one, I infer that the heavier body moves more slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://galileoandeinstein.physics.virginia.edu/tns61.htm |title=Galileo on Aristotle and Acceleration  |accessdate=2008-05-24 }} &lt;/ref&gt;}}

Although the extract does not convey the elegance and power of the 'demonstration' terribly well, it is clear that it is a 'thought' experiment, rather than a practical one. Strange then, as Cohen says, that philosophers and scientists alike refuse to acknowledge either Galileo in particular, or the thought experiment technique in general for its pivotal role in both science and philosophy. (The exception proves the rule&amp;nbsp;— the iconoclastic philosopher of science, [[Paul Feyerabend]], has also observed this methodological prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Paul Feyerabend, 'Against Method', Verso (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;)

Instead, many philosophers prefer to consider 'Thought Experiments' to be merely the use of a hypothetical [[scenario]] to help understand the way things are.

== Variety ==
Thought experiments have been used in a variety of fields, including [[philosophy]], [[law]], [[physics]], and [[mathematics]]. In philosophy, they have been used at least since [[classical antiquity]], some pre-dating [[Socrates]]. In law, they were well-known to [[Roman law]]yers quoted in the [[Pandects|Digest]].&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Pandects'' "every logical rule of law is capable of illumination from the law of the Pandects."&lt;/ref&gt; In physics and other sciences, notable thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th century, but examples can be found at least as early as [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]].

==Origins and use of the literal term==
Johann Witt-Hansen established that [[Hans Christian Ørsted]] was the first to use the Latin-German mixed term ''Gedankenexperiment'' (lit. thought experiment) circa 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Witt-Hansen (1976). Although ''Experiment'' is a German word, it is derived from [[Latin]]. The synonym ''Versuch'' has purely [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] roots.&lt;/ref&gt; Ørsted was also the first to use its entirely German equivalent, ''Gedankenversuch'', in 1820.

Much later, [[Ernst Mach]] used the term ''Gedankenexperiment'' in a different way, to denote exclusively the ''imaginary'' conduct of a ''real'' experiment that would be subsequently performed as a ''real physical experiment'' by his students.&lt;ref&gt;Mach, Ernst (1883), The Science of Mechanics (6th edition, translated by Thomas J. McCormack), LaSalle, Illinois: Open Court, 1960.  pp. 32-41, 159-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Physical and mental experimentation could then be contrasted: Mach asked his students to provide him with explanations whenever the results from their subsequent, real, physical experiment differed from those of their prior, imaginary experiment.

The English term ''thought experiment'' was coined (as a [[calque]]) from Mach's ''Gedankenexperiment'', and it first appeared in the 1897 English translation of one of Mach’s papers.&lt;ref&gt;Mach, Ernst (1897), "On Thought Experiments", in ''Knowledge and Error'' (translated by Thomas J. McCormack and Paul Foulkes), Dordrecht Holland: Reidel, 1976, pp. 134-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to its emergence, the activity of posing hypothetical questions that employed subjunctive reasoning had existed for a very long time (for both scientists and philosophers). However, people had no way of categorizing it or speaking about it. This helps to explain the extremely wide and diverse range of the application of the term "thought experiment" once it had been introduced into English.

==Uses==
Thought experiments, which are well-structured, well-defined hypothetical questions that employ [[subjunctive]] reasoning ([[irrealis moods]]) – "What might happen (or, what might have happened) if . . . " – have been used to pose questions in philosophy at least since Greek antiquity, some pre-dating [[Socrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|authorlink=Nicholas Rescher|last=Rescher |first= N.|chapter=Thought Experiment in Pre-Socratic Philosophy|pages=31–41 |editor1-last=Horowitz  |editor1-first=T. |editor2-last=Massey |editor2-first=G.J.  |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00003190/ |title=Thought Experiments in Science and Philosophy | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, (Savage)|year=1991 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In physics and other sciences many thought experiments date from the 19th and especially the 20th Century, but examples can be found at least as early as [[Galileo]].

In thought experiments we gain new information by rearranging or reorganizing already known empirical data in a new way and drawing new (a priori) inferences from them or by looking at these data from a different and unusual perspective. In Galileo’s thought experiment, for example, the rearrangement of empirical experience consists in the original idea of combining bodies of different weight.&lt;ref&gt;Brendal, Elke, "Intuition Pumps and the Proper Use of Thought Experiments". Dialectica. V.58, Issue 1, p 89–108, March   2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Thought experiments have been used in [[philosophy]] (especially [[ethics]]), [[physics]], and other fields (such as [[cognitive psychology]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[social psychology]], [[law]], [[organizational studies]], [[marketing]], and [[epidemiology]]).  In law, the synonym "hypothetical" is frequently used for such experiments.

Regardless of their intended goal, all thought experiments display a patterned way of thinking that is designed to allow us to explain, predict and control events in a better and more productive way.

===Theoretical consequences===
In terms of their theoretical consequences, thought experiments generally:
* challenge (or even refute) a prevailing theory, often involving the device known as [[reductio ad absurdum]], (as in Galileo's original argument, a [[proof by contradiction]]),
* confirm a prevailing theory,
* establish a new theory, or
* simultaneously refute a prevailing theory and establish a new theory through a process of mutual exclusion

===Practical applications===
Thought experiments can produce some very important and different outlooks on previously unknown or unaccepted theories. However, they may make those theories themselves irrelevant, and could possibly create new problems that are just as difficult, or possibly more difficult to resolve.

In terms of their practical application, thought experiments are generally created to:
* challenge the prevailing [[status quo]] (which includes activities such as correcting [[misinformation]] (or misapprehension), identify flaws in the argument(s) presented, to  preserve (for the long-term) objectively established fact, and to refute  specific assertions that some particular thing is permissible, forbidden, known, believed, possible, or necessary);
* [[extrapolate]] beyond (or [[interpolate]] within) the boundaries of already established fact;
* [[predict]] and [[forecasting|forecast]] the (otherwise) indefinite and unknowable future;
* explain the past;
* the [[retrodiction]], [[postdiction]] and [[hindcast]]ing of the (otherwise) indefinite and unknowable past;
* facilitate decision making, choice and strategy selection;
* solve problems, and generate ideas;
* move current (often insoluble) problems into another, more helpful and more productive problem space (e.g.: [[functional fixedness]]);
* attribute causation, preventability, blame and responsibility for specific outcomes;
* assess [[culpability]] and [[compensatory damages]] in social and legal contexts;
* ensure the repeat of past success; or
* examine the extent to which past events might have occurred differently.
* ensure the (future) avoidance of past failures

==In science==
Scientists tend to use thought experiments as imaginary, "proxy" experiments prior to a real, "physical" experiment ([[Ernst Mach]] always argued that these '''''gedankenexperiments''''' were "a necessary precondition for physical experiment"). In these cases, the result of the "proxy" experiment will often be so clear that there will be no need to conduct a physical experiment at all.

Scientists also use thought experiments when particular physical experiments are impossible to conduct ([[Carl Gustav Hempel]] labeled these sorts of experiment "''theoretical experiments-in-imagination''"), such as [[Einstein's thought experiments|Einstein's thought experiment]] of chasing a light beam, leading to [[special relativity]].  This is a unique use of a scientific thought experiment, in that it was never carried out, but led to a successful theory, proven by other empirical means.

==Relation to real experiments==
The relation to real experiments can be quite complex, as can be seen again from an example going back to Albert Einstein. In 1935, with two coworkers, he published a paper on a newly created subject called later the EPR effect ([[EPR paradox]]). In this paper, starting from certain philosophical assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E.T. (1989).[http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/cmystery.pdf  Clearing up the Mysteries], opening talk at the 8th International MAXENT Workshop, St John's College, Cambridge UK.&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis of a rigorous analysis of a certain, complicated, but in the meantime assertedly realizable model, he came to the conclusion that  ''quantum mechanics should be described as "incomplete"''. [[Niels Bohr]] asserted a refutation of Einstein's analysis immediately, and his view prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;French, A.P., Taylor, E.F. (1979/1989). ''An Introduction to Quantum Physics'', Van Nostrand Reinhold (International), London, {{ISBN|0-442-30770-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, J.A, Zurek, W.H., editors (1983). ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;d'Espagnat, B. (2006). ''On Physics and Philosophy'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, {{ISBN|978-0-691-11964-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some decades, it was asserted that feasible experiments could prove the error of the EPR paper. These experiments tested the [[Bell inequalities]] published in 1964 in a purely theoretical paper. The above-mentioned EPR philosophical starting assumptions were considered to be falsified by empirical fact (e.g. by the optical ''real experiments'' of  [[Alain Aspect]]).

Thus ''thought experiments'' belong to a theoretical discipline, usually to [[theoretical physics]], but often to [[theoretical philosophy]]. In any case, it must be distinguished from a real experiment, which belongs naturally to the experimental discipline and has "the final decision on ''true'' or ''not true''", at least in physics.

==Causal reasoning==
The first characteristic pattern that thought experiments display is their orientation
in time.&lt;ref&gt;Yeates, 2004, pp.138-143.&lt;/ref&gt; They are either:
* ''Antefactual speculations'': experiments that speculate about what might have happened prior to a specific, designated event, or
* ''Postfactual speculations'': experiments that speculate about what may happen subsequent to (or consequent upon) a specific, designated event.

The second characteristic pattern is their movement in time in relation to “the present
moment standpoint” of the individual performing the experiment; namely, in terms of:
* Their ''temporal direction'': are they past-oriented or future-oriented?
* Their ''temporal sense'':
:(a) in the case of past-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal “movement” from the present to the past, or from the past to the present? or,
:(b) in the case of future-oriented thought experiments, are they examining the consequences of temporal “movement” from the present to the future, or from the future to the present?

== Seven types ==
[[File:The Prefactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a prefactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.143.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Generally speaking, there are seven types of thought experiments in which one reasons from causes to effects, or effects to causes:&lt;ref&gt;See Yeates, 2004, pp.138-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prefactual===
''Prefactual (before the fact) thought experiments'' — the term '''[[Defensive_pessimism#Prefactual_thinking|prefactual]]''' was coined by Lawrence J. Sanna in 1998&lt;ref&gt;Sanna, L.J., "Defensive Pessimism and Optimism: The Bitter-Sweet Influence of Mood on Performance and Prefactual and Counterfactual Thinking", ''Cognition and Emotion'', Vol.12, No.5, (September 1998), pp.635-665. (Sanna used the term ''prefactual'' to distinguish these sorts of thought experiment from both ''semifactuals'' and ''counterfactuals''.)&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on possible future outcomes, given the present, and ask "What will be the outcome if event E occurs?"

===Counterfactual===
[[File:The Counterfactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a counterfactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Counterfactual (contrary to established fact) thought experiments'' — the term ''[[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]]'' was coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.44, No.5, (27 February 1947), pp.113-128.&lt;/ref&gt; extending [[Roderick Chisholm]]'s (1946) notion of a "contrary-to-fact conditional"&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, R.M., "The Contrary-to-Fact Conditional", ''Mind'', Vol.55, No.220, (October 1946), pp.289-307.&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on the possible outcomes of a different past;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]] (''[[Shadows of the Mind|Shadows of the Mind: A Search for the Missing Science of Consciousness]]'', Oxford University Press, (Oxford),1994, p.240) considers counterfactuals to be "things that might have happened, although they did not in fact happen".&lt;/ref&gt; and ask "What might have happened if A had happened instead of B?" (e.g., "If [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]  '''''had'''''  cooperated with each other, what would mathematics look like today?").&lt;ref&gt;In 1748, when defining causation, [[David Hume]] referred to a counterfactual case: "…we may define a cause to be an ''object, followed by another, and where all objects, similar to the first, are followed by objects similar to the second''. Or in other words, ''where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed'' …" (Hume, D. (Beauchamp, T.L., ed.), ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1999, (7), p.146.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semifactual===
[[File:The Semifactual Thought Experiment.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of a semifactual thought experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
''Semifactual thought experiments'' — the term ''semifactual'' was coined by [[Nelson Goodman]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, N., "The Problem of Counterfactual Conditionals", ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol.44, No.5, (27 February 1947), pp.113-128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goodman's original concept has been subsequently developed and expanded by (a) Daniel Cohen (Cohen, D., "Semifactuals, Even-Ifs, and Sufficiency", ''International Logic Review'', Vol.16, (1985), pp.102-111), (b) Stephen Barker (Barker, S., "''Even'', ''Still'' and Counterfactuals", ''Linguistics and Philosophy'', Vol.14, No.1, (February 1991), pp.1-38; Barker, S., "Counterfactuals, Probabilistic Counterfactuals and Causation", ''Mind'', Vol.108, No.431, (July 1999), pp.427-469), and (c) Rachel McCloy and Ruth Byrne (McCloy, R. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J., "Semifactual 'Even If' Thinking", ''Thinking and Reasoning'', Vol.8, No.1, (February 2002), pp.41-67).&lt;/ref&gt; — speculate on the extent to which things might have remained the same, despite there being a different past; and asks the question Even though X happened instead of E, would Y have still occurred? (e.g., Even if the goalie '''''had''''' moved left, rather than right, could he have intercepted a ball that was traveling at such a speed?).

Semifactual speculations are an important part of clinical medicine.

===Prediction===
[[File:Prediction, Forecasting and Nowcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of prediction, forecasting and nowcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.145.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of [[prediction]] attempts to project the circumstances of the present into the future. According to David Sarewitz and Roger Pielke (1999, p123), scientific prediction takes two forms:
:(1) “The elucidation of invariant — and therefore predictive — principles of nature”; and
:(2) “[Using] suites of observational data and sophisticated numerical models in an effort to foretell the behavior or evolution of complex phenomena”.&lt;ref&gt;Sarewitz, D. &amp; Pielke, R., "Prediction in Science and Policy", ''Technology in Society'', Vol.21, No.2, (April 1999), pp.121-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they perform different social and scientific functions, the only difference between the qualitatively identical activities of ''predicting'', ''forecasting,'' and ''nowcasting'' is the distance of the speculated future from the present moment occupied by the user.&lt;ref&gt;Nowcasting (obviously based on forecasting) is also known as ''very-short-term forecasting''; thus, also indicating a ''very-short-term'', ''mid-range'', and ''long-range forecasting'' continuum.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the activity of nowcasting, defined as “a detailed description of the current weather along with forecasts obtained by extrapolation up to 2 hours ahead”, is essentially concerned with describing the current state of affairs, it is common practice to extend the term “to cover very-short-range forecasting up to 12 hours ahead” (Browning, 1982, p.ix).&lt;ref&gt;Browning, K.A. (ed.), ''Nowcasting'', Academic Press, (London), 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, and Brown — Murphy, A.H. &amp; Brown, B.G., "Similarity and Analogical Reasoning: A Synthesis", pp.3-15 in Browning, K.A. (ed.),
''Nowcasting'', Academic Press, (London), 1982 — describe a large range of specific applications for meteorological nowcasting over wide range of user demands:&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Agriculture: (a) wind and precipitation forecasts for effective seeding and spraying from aircraft; (b) precipitation forecasts to minimize damage to seedlings; (c) minimum temperature, dewpoint, cloud cover, and wind speed forecasts to protect crops from frost; (d) maximum temperature forecasts to reduce adverse effects of high temperatures on crops and livestock; (e) humidity and cloud cover forecasts to prevent fungal disease crop losses ; (f) hail forecasts to minimize damage to livestock and greenhouses; (g) precipitation, temperature, and dewpoint
forecasts to avoid during- and after-harvest losses due to crops rotting in the field; (h) precipitation forecasts to minimize losses in drying raisins; and (i) humidity forecasts to reduce costs and losses resulting from poor conditions for drying tobacco.&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Construction: (a) precipitation and wind speed forecasts to avoid damage to finished work (e.g. concrete) and minimize costs of protecting exposed surfaces, structures, and work sites; and (b) precipitation, wind speed, and high/low temperature forecasts to schedule work in an efficient manner.&lt;br /&gt;
(3) Energy: (a) temperature, humidity, wind, cloud, etc. forecasts to optimize procedures related to generation and distribution of electricity and gas; (b) forecasts of thunderstorms, strong winds, low temperatures, and freezing precipitation minimize damage to lines and equipment and
to schedule repairs.&lt;br /&gt;
(4) Transportation: (a) ceiling height and visibility, winds and turbulence, and surface ice and snow forecasts minimize risk, maximize efficiency in pre-flight and in-flight decisions and other adjustments to weather-related fluctuations in traffic; (b) forecasts of wind speed and direction, as well as severe weather and icing conditions along flight paths facilitate optimal airline route planning; (c) forecasts of snowfall, precipitation, and other storm-related events allow truckers, motorists, and public transportation systems to avoid damage to weather-sensitive goods, select optimum routes, prevent accidents, minimize delays, and maximize revenues under conditions of adverse weather.&lt;br /&gt;
(5) Public Safety &amp; General Public: (a) rain, snow, wind, and temperature forecasts assist the general public in planning activities such as commuting, recreation, and shopping; (b) forecasts of temperature/humidity extremes (or significant changes) alert hospitals, clinics, and the public to weather conditions that may seriously aggravate certain health-related illnesses; (c) forecasts related to potentially dangerous or damaging natural events (e.g., tornados, severe thunderstorms, severe winds, storm surges, avalanches, precipitation, floods) minimize loss of life and property damage; and (d) forecasts of snowstorms, surface icing, visibility, and other events (e.g. floods) enable highway maintenance and traffic control organizations to take appropriate actions to reduce risks of traffic accidents and protect roads from damage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindcasting===

The activity of [[Backtesting#Hindcast|hindcasting]] involves running a forecast model after an event has happened in order to test whether the model's [[simulation]] is valid.

In 2003, Dake Chen and his colleagues “trained” a computer using the data of the surface temperature of the oceans from the last 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, D., Cane, M.A., Kaplan, A., Zebiak, S.E. &amp; Huang, D., "Predictability of El Niño Over the Past 148 Years", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.733-736; Anderson, D., "Testing Time for El Niño", ''Nature'', Vol.428, No.6984, (15 April 2004), pp.709, 711.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, using data that had been collected on the surface temperature of the oceans for the period 1857 to 2003, they went through a hindcasting exercise and discovered that their simulation not only accurately predicted every [[El Niño]] event for the last 148 years, it also identified the (up to 2 years) looming foreshadow of every single one of those El Niño events.&lt;ref&gt;Not only did their hindcasting demonstrate that the computerized simulation models could predict the onset of El Niño climatic events from changes in the temperature of the ocean's surface temperature that occur up to two years earlier — meaning that there was now, potentially, at least 2 years' lead time — but the results also implied that El Niño events seemed to be the effects of some causal regularity; and, therefore, were not due to simple chance.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retrodiction===
[[File:Retrodiction or Postdiction.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of retrodiction or postdiction.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.146.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of ''[[retrodiction]]'' (or ''postdiction'') involves moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the present into the speculated past to establish the ultimate cause of a specific event (e.g., [[reverse engineering]] and [[forensics]]).

Given that retrodiction is a process in which "past observations, events and data are used as evidence to infer the process(es) the produced them" and that [[Medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] "involve[s] going from visible effects such as symptoms, signs and the like to their prior causes",&lt;ref&gt;p.24, Einhorn, H.J. &amp; Hogarth, R.M., "Prediction, Diagnosis, and Causal Thinking in Forecasting", ''Journal of Forecasting'', (January–March 1982), Vol.1, No.1, pp.23-36.&lt;/ref&gt; the essential balance between prediction and retrodiction could be characterized as:
::'''retrodiction : diagnosis :: prediction : prognosis'''
regardless of whether the [[prognosis]] is of the course of the disease in the absence of treatment, or of the application of a specific treatment regimen to a specific disorder in a particular patient.&lt;ref&gt;"…We consider diagnostic inference to be based on causal thinking, although in doing diagnosis one has to mentally reverse the time order in which events were thought to have occurred (hence the term “backward inference”). On the other hand, predictions involve forward inference; i.e., one goes forward in time from present causes to future effects. However, it is important to recognize the dependence of forward inference/prediction on backward inference/diagnosis. In particular, it seems likely that success in predicting the future depends to a considerable degree on making sense of the past. Therefore, people are continually engaged in shifting between forward and backward inference in both making and evaluating forecasts. Indeed, this can be eloquently summarized by Kierkegaard's observation that, 'Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards' …"(Einhorn &amp; Hogarth, 1982, p.24).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Backcasting===
[[File:Backcasting.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Temporal representation of backcasting.&lt;ref&gt;Taken from Yeates, 2004, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The activity of ''[[backcasting]]'' — the term ''backcasting'' was coined by John Robinson in 1982&lt;ref&gt;See Robinson, J.B., "Energy Backcasting: A Proposed Method of Policy Analysis", ''Energy Policy'', Vol.10, No.4 (December 1982), pp.337-345; Robinson, J.B., "Unlearning and Backcasting: Rethinking Some of the Questions We Ask About the Future", ''Technological Forecasting and Social Change'', Vol.33, No.4, (July 1988), pp.325-338; Robinson, J., "Future Subjunctive: Backcasting as Social Learning", ''Futures'', Vol.35, No.8, (October 2003), pp.839-856.&lt;/ref&gt; — involves establishing the description of a very definite and very specific future situation. It then involves an imaginary moving backwards in time, step-by-step, in as many stages as are considered necessary, from the future to the present to reveal the mechanism through which that particular specified future could be attained from the present.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson's backcasting approach is very similar to the ''anticipatory scenarios'' of Ducot and Lubben (Ducot, C. &amp; Lubben, G.J., "A Typology for Scenarios", ''Futures'', Vol.11, No.1, (February 1980), pp.51-57), and Bunn and Salo (Bunn, D.W. &amp; Salo, A.A., "Forecasting with scenarios", European Journal of Operational Research, Vol.68, No.3, (13 August 1993), pp.291-303).&lt;/ref&gt;

Backcasting is not concerned with predicting the future:
::The major distinguishing characteristic of backcasting analyses is the concern, not with likely energy futures, but with how desirable futures can be attained. It is thus explicitly [[normative]], involving 'working backwards' from a particular future end-point to the present to determine what policy measures would be required to reach that future.&lt;ref&gt;p.814, Dreborg, K.H., "Essence of Backcasting", ''Futures'', Vol.28, No.9, (November 1996), pp.813-828.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jansen (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;503:&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, L., "Towards a Sustainable Future, en route with Technology", pp.496-525 in Dutch Committee for Long-Term Environmental Policy (ed.), ''The Environment: Towards a Sustainable Future (Environment &amp; Policy, Volume 1)'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, (Dortrecht), 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
::Within the framework of technological development, “forecasting” concerns the extrapolation of developments towards the future and the exploration of achievements that can be realized through technology in the long term. Conversely, the reasoning behind “backcasting” is: on the basis of an interconnecting picture of demands technology must meet in the future — “sustainability criteria” — to direct and determine the process that technology development must take and possibly also the pace at which this development process must take effect.
::Backcasting [is] both an important aid in determining the direction technology development must take and in specifying the targets to be set for this purpose. As such, backcasting is an ideal search toward determining the nature and scope of the technological challenge posed by sustainable development, and it can thus serve to direct the search process toward new — sustainable — technology.

==In philosophy==
In philosophy, a thought experiment typically presents an imagined scenario with the intention of eliciting an intuitive or reasoned response about the way things are in the thought experiment.  (Philosophers might also supplement their thought experiments with theoretical reasoning designed to support the desired intuitive response.)  The scenario will typically be designed to target a particular philosophical notion, such as morality, or the nature of the mind or linguistic reference.  The response to the imagined scenario is supposed to tell us about the nature of that notion in any scenario, real or imagined.

For example, a thought experiment might present a situation in which an agent intentionally kills an innocent for the benefit of others.  Here, the relevant question is not whether the action is moral or not, but more broadly whether a moral theory is correct that says morality is determined solely by an action's consequences (See [[Consequentialism]]).  [[John Searle]] imagines a man in a locked room who receives written sentences in Chinese, and returns written sentences in Chinese, according to a sophisticated instruction manual.  Here, the relevant question is not whether or not the man understands Chinese, but more broadly, whether a [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist theory of mind]] is correct.

It is generally hoped that there is universal agreement about the intuitions that a thought experiment elicits.  (Hence, in assessing their own thought experiments, philosophers may appeal to "what we should say," or some such locution.)  A successful thought experiment will be one in which intuitions about it are widely shared.  But often, philosophers differ in their intuitions about the scenario.

Other philosophical uses of imagined scenarios arguably are thought experiments also.  In one use of scenarios, philosophers might imagine persons in a particular situation (maybe ourselves), and ask what they would do.

For example, in the [[veil of ignorance]], [[John Rawls]] asks us to imagine a group of persons in a situation where they know nothing about themselves, and are charged with devising a social or political organization. The use of the [[state of nature]] to imagine the origins of government, as by [[Hobbes|Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]], may also be considered a thought experiment. [[Søren Kierkegaard]] explored the possible ethical and religious implications of [[Abraham]]'s [[binding of Isaac]] in ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'' Similarly, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], in ''[[On the Genealogy of Morals]]'', speculated about the historical development of Judeo-Christian morality, with the intent of questioning its legitimacy.

An early written thought experiment was [[Plato]]'s [[allegory of the cave]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Rep.'' vii, I–III, 514–518B.&lt;/ref&gt; Another historic thought experiment was [[Avicenna]]'s "[[Avicennism#Thought experiments on self-consciousness|Floating Man]]" thought experiment in the 11th century. He asked his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air isolated from all [[Wikt:sensation|sensations]] in order to demonstrate human [[self-awareness]] and [[self-consciousness]], and the [[Substance theory|substantiality]] of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 315, [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-415-13159-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possibility===
In many thought experiments, the scenario would be [[nomological possibility|nomologically possible]], or possible according to the laws of nature.  John Searle's [[Chinese room]] is nomologically possible.

Some thought experiments present scenarios that are not [[Subjunctive possibility|nomologically]] possible.  In his [[Twin Earth thought experiment]], [[Hilary Putnam]] asks us to imagine a scenario in which there is a substance with all of the observable properties of water (e.g., taste, color, boiling point), but is chemically different from water.  It has been argued that this thought experiment is not nomologically possible, although it may be possible in some other sense, such as [[metaphysical possibility]].  It is debatable whether the nomological impossibility of a thought experiment renders intuitions about it moot.

In some cases, the hypothetical scenario might be considered metaphysically impossible, or impossible in any sense at all.  [[David Chalmers]] says that we can imagine that there are [[philosophical zombie|zombies]], or persons who are physically identical to us in every way but who lack consciousness.  This is supposed to show that [[physicalism]] is false.  However, some argue that zombies are inconceivable:  we can no more imagine a zombie than we can imagine that 1+1=3. Others have claimed that the conceivability of a scenario may not entail its possibility.

===Interactive thought experiments in digital environments===
{{External links|section|date=May 2018}}
The philosophical work of [[Stefano Gualeni]] focuses on the use of virtual worlds to materialize thought experiments and to playfully negotiate philosophical ideas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools: How to Philosophize with a Digital Hammer|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-52178-1|location=Basingstoke (UK)|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arguments were originally presented in his 2015 book [http://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9781137521774 ''Virtual Worlds as Philosophical Tools''.]

Gualeni's argument is that the history of philosophy has, until recently, merely been the history of written thought, and digital media can complement and enrich the limited and almost exclusively linguistic approach to philosophical thought.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gualeni|first=Stefano|date=2016|title=Self-reflexive videogames: observations and corollaries on virtual worlds as philosophical artifacts|url=http://www.gamejournal.it/gualeni-self-reflexive-videogames/|journal=G A M E, The Italian Journal of Game Studies|volume=1, 5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He considers virtual worlds to be philosophically viable and advantageous in contexts like those of thought experiments, when the recipients of a certain philosophical notion or perspective are expected to objectively test and evaluate different possible courses of action, or in cases where they are confronted with interrogatives concerning non-actual or non-human phenomenologies &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Among the most visible thought experiments designed by [[Stefano Gualeni]]:

* [http://evil.gua-le-ni.com ''Necessary Evil''] (2013)

* [[Braitenberg vehicle]]s (robotics, neural control and sensing systems) (some have been built)
* [[Doomsday argument]] ([[anthropic principle]])
* [[The Lady, or the Tiger?]] (human nature)&lt;ref&gt;While the problem presented in this short story's scenario is not unique, it is extremely unusual. Most thought experiments are intentionally (or, even, sometimes unintentionally) skewed towards the inevitable production of a particular solution to the problem posed; and this happens because of the way that the problem and the scenario are framed in the first place. In the case of ''The Lady, or the Tiger?'', the way that the story unfolds is so "end-neutral" that, at the finish, there is no "correct" solution to the problem. Therefore, all that one can do is to offer one's own innermost thoughts on how the account of human nature that has been presented might unfold ? according to one's own experience of human nature ? which is, obviously, the purpose of the entire exercise. The extent to which the story can provoke such an extremely wide range of (otherwise [[equipollent]]) predictions of the participants' subsequent behaviour is one of the reasons the story has been so popular over time.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14938">The '''throw-away society''' is a human society strongly influenced by [[consumerism]]. The term describes a critical view of [[overconsumption]] and excessive production of short-lived or [[disposable]] items over durable goods that can be repaired.

==Origin of the term==
In its August 1, 1955 issue [[Life magazine]] published an article titled ''"Throwaway Living"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lifemagazineconnection.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;products_id=1069&lt;/ref&gt;
This article has been cited as the source that first used the term "throw-away society".&lt;ref&gt;http://photo.pds.org:5012/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2007121404&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise of packaging waste==
As a consequence of economic growth, we have seen both increased production and increased product waste during the last century. Between the start of New York City [[waste collection]]s in 1905 and 2005 there was a tenfold rise in "product [[waste]]" ([[packaging]] and old products), from 92 to 1,242 pounds (42 to 563 kilograms) per person per year. Containers and packaging now represent 32 percent of all [[municipal solid waste]]. Non-durable goods (defined as products in use for less than three years) constitute 27 percent, while durable goods comprise 16 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Products, Waste, And The End Of The Throwaway Society, Helen Spiegelman and Bill Sheehan, The Networker, http://www.sehn.org/Volume_10-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food service and disposable food packaging==
{{see|Disposable food packaging}}
[[Disposable tableware]] was a key part of the business strategy of chain [[Fast food|fast food]] restaurants in the US.&lt;ref name="feedbins"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37JhTU1lVp8 McDonald's ad "Feed the Wastebaskets"] (video), training children to bus disposable packaging [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tRmNqpdG6M (alternate link)]&lt;/ref&gt; In order for the business model to work, fast food chains found it economically advantageous to convince consumers through advertising campaigns to carry their own tableware to a waste bins, in order to avoid labor expenses incurred in clearing tables.&lt;ref name="dontbus"&gt;[http://www.skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html http://skoozeme.com/issues/dontbus.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  By establishing a custom in which customers are encouraged to carry disposables, some of the internal costs of the disposable tableware can be offset.

In 2002, [[Taiwan]] began taking action to reduce the use of [[disposable tableware]] at institutions and businesses, and to reduce the use of [[plastic bag]]s. Yearly, the nation of 17.7 million people was producing {{convert|59000|t}} of disposable tableware waste and {{convert|105000|t}} of waste plastic bags, and increasing measures have been taken in the years since then to reduce the amount of waste.&lt;ref&gt;Env. Research Foundation (undated). [http://www.rachel.org/?q=en/node/149 Taiwan’s Plastics Ban].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Taiwan's Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) banned outright the use of disposable tableware in the nation's 968 schools, government agencies and hospitals.  The ban is expected to eliminate {{convert|2600|t}} of waste like [[disposable cup]]s yearly.&lt;ref&gt;China Post. June 5, 2013. [http://www.chinapost.com.tw/print/111477.htm EPA to ban disposable cups from June 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]], laws banning use of disposable food and drink containers at large-scale events have been enacted. Such a ban has been in place in Munich, Germany since 1991, applying to all city facilities and events. This includes events of all sizes, including very large ones ([[Christmas market]], Auer-Dult Faire, [[Oktoberfest]] and Munich City Marathon). For small events of a few hundred people, the city has arranged for a corporation offer rental of crockery and dishwasher equipment. In part through this regulation, Munich reduced the waste generated by Oktoberfest, which attracts tens of thousands of people, from 11,000 metric tons in 1990 to 550 tons in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Pre-Waste EU. (undated).

China produces about 57 billion pairs of [[single-use]] [[chopstick]]s yearly, of which half are exported. About 45 percent are made from trees &amp;ndash; about 3.8 million of them &amp;ndash; mainly [[Populus|cotton wood]], [[birch]], and [[spruce]], the remainder being made from [[bamboo]]. Japan uses about 24 billion pairs of these disposables per year, and globally about 80 billion pairs are thrown away by about 1.4 million people. Reusable chopsticks in restaurants have a lifespan of 130 meals. In Japan, with disposable ones costing about 2 cents and reusable ones costing typically $1.17, the reusables better the $2.60 breakeven cost. Campaigns in several countries to reduce this waste are beginning to have some effect.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times. Reus Oct. 24, 2011.

==Waste and socioeconomic status==
[[Garbage]] produced because of the rise in [[disposable product]]s is often shipped from richer to poorer nations, causing [[environmental issue|environmental]] and social problems for [[developing nation]]s. Most notable are the large shipments of trash from North America and Western Europe to Africa and Asia due to the relatively low cost of disposal. By the 1990s, over half of all nations in Africa have faced negative externalities from [[toxic waste]] dumped by richer countries. Waste, both toxic and non-toxic is often dumped without [[safety regulations]]. It is thrown in unlined and unregulated [[landfill]]s where it [[soil contamination|contaminates soil]] and water, and even [[waste incineration|burnt]], which circulates toxins in the air. Recently, [[electronic waste]] shipped to [[Nigeria]] has increased due to higher consumption of electronics by North America Europe, with hundreds of shipments of old electronics dropped off at [[Lagos]], Nigeria, every month. A significantly large percentage of the trash being hazardous waste shipped with the "explicit intent of cheap (and unsafe) disposal". China, also, receives huge amounts of waste, often toxic material, averaging 1.9 million tons per year, because companies find it cheaper to ship garbage away rather than dispose of it themselves.

==Food waste==
{{main article|food waste}}
In 2004, a [[University of Arizona]] study indicates that forty to fifty percent of all edible food never gets eaten. Every year [[orders of magnitude (currency)|$43 billion]] worth of edible food is estimated to be thrown away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=US wastes half its food | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Suppliers2/US-wastes-half-its-food | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2014-07-05 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned obsolescence==
"[[Planned obsolescence]]" is a manufacturing philosophy developed in the 1920s and 1930s, when [[mass production]] became popular.  The goal is to make a product or part that will fail, or become less desirable over time or after a certain amount of use. Vance Packard, author of ''[[The Waste Makers]]'', book published in 1960, called this "the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, [[debt]]-ridden, permanently discontented individuals."

==Durability of goods==

Producers make goods disposable rather than durable so that consumers must continue to repurchase the good, earning the producer a steady supply of customers, rather than a one-time purchase. Profit is maximized for the firm when the usefulness of a good is "uneconomically short", because firms can spend the least amount possible creating a nondurable good, which they sell repeatedly to the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bulow|first1=Jeremy|title=An Economic Theory of Planned Obsolescence|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=November 1986|volume=101|issue=4|pages=729|doi=10.2307/1884176|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=4627944&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=29 November 2017|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goods are often replaced even before their usefulness runs out. The perceived durability of a good in a throwaway society is often less than its physical durability. For example, in fast fashion, consumers buy the latest, novelty item because producers market styles that pass with the seasons. There is pressure on producers to advertise an increased number of "seasons", creating new styles so consumers can update their wardrobes often by buying cheap and flimsy, yet stylish clothes to keep up with current fashion trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bhardwaj|first1=Vertica|last2=Fairhurst|first2=Ann|title=Fast fashion: response to changes in the fashion industry|journal=The International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research|date=18 February 2010|volume=20|issue=1|doi=10.1080/09593960903498300|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09593960903498300|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Items that once were considered durable items are now almost exclusively disposable, so it is actually more difficult for consumers who want a durable version to find anywhere selling one. The shift to disposable was ostensibly because of reasons such as convenience or hygiene, even if the inconvenience of using a durable version is very slight, or there is no proven increase in hygiene. This can lead to higher costs over time, more waste produced, more resources used, and lesser quality goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Tim|title=Longer Lasting Products: Alternatives To The Throwaway Society|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|pages=4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only has there been a movement by manufacturers towards goods that are less durable and not maintainable, producers have also withheld technology that would make common goods more durable, such as in the manufacture of light bulbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Tim|title=Longer Lasting Products: Alternatives To The Throwaway Society|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-566-08808-7|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian church attitude==

[[Pope Francis]] frequently speaks about a "throwaway culture" in which unwanted items and unwanted people, such as the unborn, the elderly, and the poor, are discarded as waste.&lt;ref name=vow&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/opinion/the-popes-ecological-vow.html?_r=0 | title = The Pope's Ecological Vow | first = Paul | last = Vallely | authorlink = Paul Vallely | date = June 28, 2015 | accessdate = June 29, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=return&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2015/06/the-return-of-catholic-anti-modernism | title = The Return of Catholic Anti-Modernism | first = R.R. | last = Reno | date = June 18, 2015 | accessdate = June 30, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abortion&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Pope Calls Abortion Evidence of Throwaway Culture | date= | publisher= | url =https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/01/13/262085456/pope-calls-abortion-evidence-of-the-throwaway-culture | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2014-01-13 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his encyclical [[Laudato si']], he discusses pollution, waste, the lack of recycling, and the destruction of the earth as symptoms of this throwaway culture.&lt;ref name=Laudato&gt;{{cite web | url =http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html | title = Encyclical Letter Laudato Si’ Of The Holy Father Francis On Care For Our Common Home (official English-language text of encyclical) |accessdate=June 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Francis stated that in a throwaway culture, even [[human|human lives]] are seen as disposable.&lt;ref name=abortion/&gt;&lt;ref name=Laudato/&gt;   He also cited the dangers of this culture in connection with [[immigration]], saying, "A change of attitude towards [[human migration|migrant]]s and [[refugee]]s is needed on the part of everyone, moving away from attitudes of defensiveness and fear, indifference and [[marginalization]] – all typical of a throwaway culture – towards attitudes based on a culture of [[Encounter (psychology)|encounter]], the only culture capable of building a better, more just and fraternal world."&lt;ref name=protection&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Pope calls for protection of unaccompanied child migrants | date= | publisher= | url =http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2014/07/15/pope_calls_for_protection_of_unaccompanied_child_migrants_/1102879 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2014-07-22 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Christian Aid campaigners with Hilary Benn and Andrew Smith 20050127.jpg|thumb|Activists from [[Christian Aid]] lobbying for Trade Justice.]]

'''Trade justice''' is a campaign by [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]], plus efforts by other actors, to change the rules and practices of [[International trade|world trade]] in order to promote fairness. These organizations include consumer groups, trade unions, faith groups, [[aid agency|aid agencies]] and environmental groups.

The organizations campaigning for trade justice posit this concept in opposition to [[free trade]], the advocates of which often also claim pro-poor outcomes.  Trade justice advocates argue that truly free trade does not and will never exist, and that governmental policies on trade should be in the public interest, rather than the interest of wealthy entities who try to influence trade negotiation to benefit their individual interests. Advocates of trade justice argue that growing inequity and serious gaps in [[social justice]], and the global export of [[terrorism]], are symptoms of an economic system that permits harms to be exported to other countries, while importing their goods.  They point to [[extinction]], [[deforestation]], [[social unrest]], as consequences of [[globalisation]], and in particular of an "unfair" globalisation. In the past, the responses sought by critics of the international trade system included various penalties on "unfair" goods. This argument generally made little headway against the long-term movement towards [[free trade]]; imposition of penalties for "[[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]" was sometimes motivated by domestic political reasons such as the United States imposition of [[steel tariffs]] in 2001).

Today, the trade justice movement concentrates more on the abolition of [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and dumping, and to a much lesser extent on offsetting penalties on "unfair" goods. Indeed, although there are many who are still critical of free trade in general, there is a trend towards campaigning against what is seen as [[hypocrisy]] by [[developed countries]] in using [[protectionism]] against the poorest countries, especially in agricultural products, while requiring them to leave their own producers without protection.

== Trade justice movement ==

The [[Trade Justice Movement]] in the UK was the first formal coalition of groups to use the term "trade justice" (partly because in the UK, "[[fair trade]]" usually refers to [[Fairtrade certification]] and is a consumer model of change rather than an overtly political movement calling for government action). The term trade justice has been widely adopted internationally by campaign groups, for example by the over 100 national platforms of the [[Global Call to Action Against Poverty]] where it is one of the four main demands. In many countries "[[fair trade]]" is used as well as or instead of "trade justice".

The global institutions that are most often targeted in trade justice campaigns against the alleged injustices of the current international trade system are the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB). Campaigners also lobby their own governments with the intention of creating pressure on them to prioritise poverty reduction when making international trade rules. In trading blocs such as the [[European Union]] (EU), the campaigns seek to influence policy across a number of member state governments.

"Trade Justice" and "Fair Trade" were originally used by those supporting [[social justice]] and the alleviation of the intense [[poverty]] found in many developing nations. They contrasted "fair trade" with 'unfair' [[international trade]] practices. It is associated particularly with [[Labor union|labour unions]] and [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]], in their criticism of disparities between the protections for [[Capital (economics)|capital]] versus those for labour and the environment. The use of the term has expanded beyond campaigns to reform current trading practices, and the major institutions such as the [[World Trade Organization]] which embody them. Now it has become a movement to allow consumers to choose ''not'' to participate in these practices. [[Fairtrade labelling]] or "Fairtrade certification" allows [[consumer]]s to identify goods especially commodities such as [[coffee]], that meet certain agreed standards of fairness.

== Issues ==

Academics such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]] argue that the insertion of a [[constructive ambiguity]] such as valuing [[innovation]] in [[bilateral trade agreements]] (and then according [[normative]] and ongoing [[lobbying]] power to such textual negotiating truces by formally linking them with [[non-violation nullification of benefits]] provisions) may undermine democratic [[sovereignty]] with regard to construction of domestic policy, particularly in areas such as the environment and public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Faunce | first = Thomas Alured | author-link = Thomas Alured Faunce | title = Reference pricing for pharmaceuticals: is the Australia–United States free trade agreement affecting Australia’s pharmaceutical benefits scheme? | journal = Med J Aust | year = 2007 | volume = 187 | pages = 240–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Faunce | first1 = TA | last2 = Neville | first2 = W | last3 = Anton | first3 = Wasson A | contribution = Non Violation Nullification of Benefit Claims: Opportunities and Dilemmas in a Rule-Based WTO Dispute Settlement System | editor-last = Bray | editor-first = M | title = Ten Years of WTO Dispute Settlement: Australian Perspectives | publisher = Office of Trade Negotiations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade | place = Commonwealth of Australia | pages = 123–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is strenuously contested by trade law officials and many domestic policy makers.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

"The mostly widely referred to demand of trade justice campaigners is access to the markets of developed countries or rich countries. When developing countries export to developed country markets, they often face tariff barriers that can be as much as four times higher than those encountered by developed countries. Poverty claims that those barriers cost poor countries $100 billion a year – twice as much as they receive in aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalfootprints.org/trade|title=Trade footprint|last=|first=|date=|website=HEC Global Learning Centre|access-date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most trade justice campaigners focus in some way on the agricultural subsidies of rich countries that make it difficult for farmers in poor countries to compete.  For example, they argue that the European Union's agricultural export subsidies encourage [[overproduction]] of goods such as [[tomato]]es or [[sugar]], which are then sold cheaply or 'dumped' in poor countries. Local farmers cannot sell their goods as cheaply and go out of business.&lt;ref name="Oxfam"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godfrey|first1=Claire|title=Stop the Dumping! How EU Agricultural Subsidies Are Damaging Livelihoods in the Developing World|url=http://www.iatp.org/files/Stop_the_Dumping_How_EU_Agricultural_Subsidies.htm|publisher=Institute for Agriculture &amp; Trade Policy|accessdate=16 February 2017|date=2002|archive-date=16 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216214819/https://www.iatp.org/files/Stop_the_Dumping_How_EU_Agricultural_Subsidies.htm|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign points to the treatment of agriculture at the WTO, which has institutionalised these injustices. In the few instances where developing countries have used the complex and expensive WTO process to declare subsidies (e.g. US cotton subsidies) excessive, developed countries ignore these rulings, which the WTO itself does not enforce. Recently rich countries have begun to talk about cutting export subsidies, but they often demand greater access to poor country markets in return.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

The term "trade justice" emphasizes that even if the playing field were level, instead of tilted against developing countries, the poorest developing countries in particular would still struggle to gain from trade if forced to trade under [[free trade]] terms.  This is because of their overwhelming lack of competitiveness – poor countries do not have huge stocks of exports waiting to be shipped to rich countries, instead most small farmers want to be able to sell their goods locally.{{Citation needed |date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.schooleconomicscience.org/em_post/justice-and-international-trade/|title=Justice and International Trade - School of Economic Science|work=School of Economic Science|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/nov/27/farming-subsidies-distort-advantages-food-insecurity|title=Why farming subsidies still distort advantages and cause food insecurity|last=Ghosh|first=Jayati|date=2013-11-27|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-20|work=|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, homosexual acts are [[LGBT rights by country or territory|legal]] in almost all [[Western countries]], and in many of these countries '''violence against LGBT people''' is classified as a [[hate crime]],&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Stotzer, R.:  [https://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/Comparison%20of%20Hate%20Crime%20Formatted.pdf Comparison of love Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups], [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06.

In [[LGBT rights in Europe|Europe]], the [[LGBT rights in the European Union|European Union]]'s [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]] and [[Charter of Fundamental Rights]] offer some protection against sexuality-based discrimination.

Historically, state-sanctioned persecution of homosexuals was mostly limited to [[male homosexuality]], termed "[[sodomy]]". During the medieval and early modern period, the penalty for sodomy was usually death. During the modern period (from the 19th century to the mid-20th century) in the Western world, the penalty was usually a fine or imprisonment.

There was a drop in locations where homosexual acts remained illegal from 2009 when there were 80 countries worldwide (notably throughout the [[LGBT in the Middle East|Middle East]], [[Central Asia]] and in most of [[Africa]], but also in some of the [[LGBT rights in the Americas#Caribbean|Caribbean]] and [[LGBT rights in Oceania|Oceania]]) with five carrying the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7883204&amp;page=1 New Benefits for Same-Sex Couples May Be Hard to Implement Abroad]"ABC News.

==State-sanctioned violence==

===Historic===
[[File:Burning of Sodomites.jpg|thumb|The knight von Hohenberg and his squire, being burned at the stake for sodomy, Zurich 1482 (Zurich Central Library)]]

====The Middle East====
An early law against sexual intercourse between men is recorded in [[Leviticus]] by the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]], prescribing the [[death penalty]]. A violent law regarding homosexual intercourse is prescribed in the [[Assyrian Empire#Middle Assyrian period|Middle Assyrian]] [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] (1075 BCE), stating: "If a man lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a [[eunuch]]".

In the account given in [[Tacitus]] ''[[Germania (Tacitus)|Germania]]'', the death penalty was reserved for two kinds of capital offenses: military treason or desertion was punished by [[hanging]], and moral infamy (cowardice and homosexuality:  ''ignavos et imbelles at corpore infames''); Gordon translates ''corpore [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'' as "unnatural prostitutes"; Tacitus refers to male homosexuality, see
David F. Greenberg, ''The construction of homosexuality'', p.&amp;nbsp;242 f. Scholarship compares the later Germanic concept of Old Norse ''[[argr]]'', Langobardic ''arga'', which combines the meanings "effeminate, cowardly, homosexual", see [[Jaan Puhvel]], 'Who were the Hittite ''hurkilas pesnes''?' in: A. Etter (eds.), ''O-o-pe-ro-si'' (FS Risch), Walter de Gruyter, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;154.

====Europe====
[[File:Bor-Nederlantsche-Oorloghen 9161.tif|{{Largethumb}}|left|Execution by fire and torture of five homosexual Franciscan monks, Bruges, 26 July 1578]]
In [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]], the poorly attested ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' penalized an adult male for committing a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against an [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|underage male citizen]] ''([[ingenui|ingenuus]])''. It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. The law may also have been used to prosecute [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|adult male citizens]] who willingly took a [[Pathicus|pathic role in same-sex acts]], but prosecutions are rarely recorded and the provisions of the law are vague; as [[John Boswell]] has noted, "if there was a law against homosexual relations, no one in [[Cicero]]'s day knew anything about it."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boswell]], ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 67–68, quotation on p. 69. See also Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116; [[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992), p. 106ff.; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 140–141; Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 86, 224; Jonathan Walters, "Invading the Roman Body," in ''Roman Sexualites'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 33–35, noting particularly the overly broad definition of the ''Lex Scantinia'' by Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (American Philosophical Society, 1953, reprinted 1991), pp. 559 and 719. Freeborn Roman men could engage in sex with males of lower status, such as prostitutes and slaves, without moral censure or losing their perceived masculinity, as long as they took the active, penetrating role; see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]].&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Roman Empire]] came under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]], all male homosexual activity was increasingly repressed, often on pain of death.&lt;ref name = THEOD&gt;(Theodosian Code 9.7.6): All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people.&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 CE,  the Christian emperors [[Constantius II|Constantius]] and [[Constans]] declared same-sex marriage to be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosian Code]] 9.8.3: ''"When a man marries and is about to offer himself to men in womanly fashion (quum vir nubit in feminam viris porrecturam), what does he wish, when sex has lost all its significance; when the crime is one which it is not profitable to know; when Venus is changed to another form; when love is sought and not found? We order the statutes to arise, the laws to be armed with an avenging sword, that those infamous persons who are now, or who hereafter may be, guilty may be subjected to exquisite punishment.''&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, in the year 390 CE,  emperors [[Valentinian II]], [[Theodosius I]] and [[Arcadius]] declared homosexual sex to be illegal and those who were guilty of it were condemned to be publicly burned alive.&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt;  Emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565 CE) made homosexuals a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] for problems such as "famines, earthquakes, and pestilences."&lt;ref&gt;Justinian ''Novels'' 77, 144; Michael Brinkschröde, "Christian Homophobia: Four Central Discourses," in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws and codes prohibiting homosexual practice were in force in [[Europe]] from the fourth&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt; to the twentieth centuries, and Muslim countries have had similar laws from the beginnings of [[Islam]] in the seventh century up to and including the present day. [[Abbasid]] [[Baghdad]], under the [[Caliph]] [[Al-Hadi]] (785–786 CE), punished homosexuality with death.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Florence|City of Florence]] also instated the death penalty. In Florence, a young boy named [[Giovanni di Giovanni]] (1350–1365?) was castrated and burned between the thighs with a red-hot iron by court order under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forbidden Friendships, Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=24, 227, 356, 360|last=Rocke|first=Michael|isbn=0-19-512292-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="litandhomo"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Literature and Homosexuality |first=Michael J |last=Meyer |year=2000 |publisher=Rodopi |page=206|isbn=90-420-0519-X |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; These punishments continued into the [[Renaissance]], and spread to the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[canton of Zürich]]. Knight Richard von Hohenberg (died 1482) was burned at the stake together with his lover, his young squire, during this time. In France, [[French people|French]] writer [[Jacques Chausson]] (1618–1661) was also burned alive for attempting to seduce the son of a nobleman.

In 17th century [[Malta]], there was harsh prejudice and laws towards those who were found guilty or speak openly of being involved in same-sex activity. English voyager and author [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]], writing in March 1616, says a Spanish soldier and a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] teenage boy were publicly burnt to [[ash|ashes]] for confessing to have practiced sodomy together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Melita Historica|last=Brincat|first=Joseph M.|title=Book reviews|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2007)4/07.pdf|date=2007|volume=14|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, and fear to similar faith, about a hundred males involved in same-sex prostitution sailed to [[Sicily]] the following day. This episode, published abroad by a foreign writer, is the most detailed account of LGBT life during the rule of the Order. It represents that homosexuality was still a [[taboo]], but a widespread practice, an [[open secret]], and LGBT-related information was suppressed.&lt;ref name="buttigieg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buttigieg|first=Emanuel|date=2011|title=Nobility, Faith and Masculinity: The Hospitaller Knights of Malta, c.1580-c.1700|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=DVqd_gb2tmMC&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=A &amp; C Black|isbn=9781441102430|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Timeline of LGBT history in Britain|England]], the [[Buggery Act 1533|Buggery Act of 1534]] made sodomy and bestiality punishable by death. This act was replaced in 1828, but sodomy remained punishable by death under the new act until 1861. The [[James Pratt and John Smith|last executions]] were in 1835.

In [[Nazi Germany]], homosexuals were among the groups targeted by [[the Holocaust]] (''See [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]]''). (In 1936, the homosexual [[Federico García Lorca]] was executed by right-wing rebels who became [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s dictatorship in Spain, Hitler's ally.) [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]] generally oppose homosexuality to the extent of supporting a renewed persecution the way it took place in Nazi Germany. Being homosexual is equated with being unmasculine and the German word ″Schwul″ ('gay') is used by German Neonazis as a curse word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/artikel/schwule-nazis-ein-brisantes-thema-f%C3%BCr-die-rechtsextreme-szene-8724|title=Schwule Nazis?

Even in countries where homosexuality is legal (most countries outside of Africa and the Middle East), there are reports of homosexual people being targeted with bullying or physical assault or even homicide.

{{further|Homophobic violence in Brazil}}
According to the Grupo Gay da Bahia, Brazil's oldest gay rights NGO, the rate of murders of homosexuals in [[LGBT rights in Brazil|Brazil]] is particularly high, with a reported 3,196 cases over the 30-year period of 1980 to 2009 (or about 0.7 cases per 100,000 population per annum).&lt;ref name="globo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/eleicoes2010/mat/2010/10/16/numero-de-assassinatos-de-gays-no-pais-cresceu-62-desde-2007-mas-tema-fica-fora-da-campanha-922804348.asp |title=Número de assassinatos de gays no país cresceu 62% desde 2007, mas tema fica fora da campanha - Jornal O Globo |publisher=Oglobo.globo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brazilian gay group [[Grupo Gay da Bahia]] (GGB) reported 190 documented alleged homophobic murders in Brazil in 2008, accounting for about 0.5% of intentional homicides in Brazil ([[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate]] 22 per 100,000 population as of 2008). 64% of the victims were gay men, 32% were [[trans women]] or transvestites, and 4% were lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 Gay-Bashing Murders Up 55 Percent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030115100/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 |date=2010-10-30 }} (ipsnews.net, 22 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
By comparison, the FBI reported five homophobic murders in the [[History of violence against LGBT people in the United States|United States]] during 2008, corresponding to 0.03% of intentional homicides (homicide rate 5.4 per 100,000 population as of 2008).

The numbers produced by the Grupo Gay da Bahia (GGB) have occasionally been contested on the grounds that they include all murders of LGBT people reported in the media — that is, not only those motivated by bias against homosexuals. Reinaldo de Azevedo, columnist of the [[right-wing]] [[Veja (magazine)|Veja]] magazine, Brazil's most read weekly publication, called the GGB's methodology "unscientific" based on the above objection: that they make no distinction between murders motivated by bias and those that were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = UM VERMELHO-E-AZUL PARA DISSECAR UMA NOTÍCIA.

[[File:Vigil of solidarity in the wake of the Orlando Pulse shooting (27027482763).jpg|thumb|Vigil held in Minneapolis for victims of the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]]]]
In many parts of the world, including much of the [[European Union]] and [[LGBT rights in the United States|United States]], acts of violence are legally classified as hate crimes, which entail harsher sentences if convicted. In some countries, this form of legislation extends to [[verbal abuse]] as well as physical violence.

Violent hate crimes against LGBT people  tend to be especially brutal, even compared to other hate crimes: "an intense rage is present in nearly all homicide cases involving gay male victims".
It is rare for a victim to just be shot; he is more likely to be stabbed multiple times, mutilated, and strangled. "They frequently involved [[torture]], cutting, mutilation... showing the absolute intent to rub out the human being because of his (sexual) preference".&lt;ref name="ALTS"/&gt;
In a particularly brutal case in the United States, on March 14, 2007, in [[Wahneta, Florida]], 25-year-old [[Ryan Keith Skipper]] was found dead from 20 stab wounds and a slit throat. His body had been dumped on a dark, rural road less than 2 miles from his home. His two alleged attackers, William David Brown, Jr., 20, and Joseph Eli Bearden, 21, were indicted for robbery and first-degree murder. Highlighting their [[malice (legal term)|malice]] and contempt for the victim, the accused killers allegedly drove around in Skipper's blood-soaked car and bragged of killing him. According to a sheriff's department affidavit, one of the men stated that Skipper was targeted because "he was a faggot."&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

In [[LGBT rights in Canada|Canada]] in 2008, police-reported data found that approximately 10% of all hate crimes in the country were motivated by sexual orientation. Of these, 56% were of a violent nature. In comparison, 38% of all racially motivated offenses were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf|title=Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Bias: 2008 Hate Crime Survey|author=Stahnke, Tad|publisher=[[Human Rights First]]|year=2008|display-authors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827144817/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org//pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf|archivedate=2010-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year in the United States, according to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] data, though 4,704 crimes were committed due to racial bias and 1,617 were committed due to sexual orientation, only one murder and one [[forcible rape]] were committed due to racial bias, whereas five murders and six rapes were committed based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="FBI Table 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2008/index.html|title=Hate Crime Statistics: Offense Type by Bias Motivation|year=2008|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Northern Ireland]] in 2008, 160 [[homophobic]] incidents and 7 [[transphobic]] incidents were reported. Of those incidents, 68.4% were violent crimes; significantly higher than for any other bias category. By contrast, 37.4% of racially motivated crimes were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

People's ignorance of and prejudice against LGBT people can contribute to the spreading of misinformation about them and subsequently to violence. In 2018, a transgender woman was killed by a mob in Hyderabad, India, following false rumors that transgender women were sex trafficking children. Three other transgender women were injured in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suri|first1=Manveena|title=Indian mob kills transgender woman over fake rumors spread on WhatsApp|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/28/asia/india-transgender-whatsapp-mob-intl/index.html|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=CNN|date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research on university-level students indicated the importance of queer visibility and its impact in creating a positive experience for LGBTIQ+ members of a campus community, this can reduce the impact and effect of incidents on youth attending university. When there is a poor climate - students are much less likely to report incidents or seek help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waling|first=Andrea|last2=Roffee|first2=James A|date=2018-03-30|title=Supporting LGBTIQ+ students in higher education in Australia: Diversity, inclusion and visibility|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0017896918762233|journal=Health Education Journal|language=en|volume=|pages=0017896918762233|doi=10.1177/0017896918762233|issn=0017-8969|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation against homophobic hate crimes===
{{Update|section|inaccurate=y|date=May 2013}}
Members of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] began describing hate crimes based on sexual orientation (as opposed to generic [[anti-discrimination]] legislation) to be counted as aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bello|first1=Barbara Giovanna|editor1-last=Stange|editor1-first=Mary Zeiss|editor2-last=Oyster|editor2-first=Carol K.|editor3-last=Sloan|editor3-first=Jane E.|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, Volume 1|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412976855|pages=662-665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA664|accessdate=22 February 2018|chapter=Hate Crimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[LGBT history in the United States|United States]] does not have federal legislation marking sexual orientation as criteria for hate crimes, but several states, including the District of Columbia, enforce harsher penalties for crimes where real or perceived sexual orientation may have been a motivator. Among these 12 countries as well, only the United States has criminal law that specifically mentions gender identity, and even then only in 11 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; In November 2010, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted 79-70 to remove "sexual orientation" from the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, a list of unjustified reasons for executions, replacing it with "discriminatory reasons on any basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/11/18/un-deletes-gay-reference-from-anti-execution-measures/|title=UN deletes gay reference from anti-execution measures|first=Jessica|last=Geen|publisher=Pink News|date=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution specifically mentions a large number of groups, including race, religion, linguistic differences, refugees, [[street children]] and [[indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=1261706&amp;type=World|title=U.N. panel cuts gay reference from violence measure|publisher=U.S. Daily|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal and police response to these types of hate crimes is hard to gauge, however. Lack of reporting by authorities on the statistics of these crimes and under-reporting by the victims themselves are factors for this difficulty.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; Often a victim will not report a crime as it will shed unwelcome light on their orientation and invite more victimization.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/02/05/bc-arron-webster-ryan-cran-released.html|title=Gay community troubled by release of killer in Stanley Park death|date=5 February 2009|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged judicative bias===

Legal defenses like the [[gay panic defense]] allow for more lenient punishments for people accused of beating, torturing, or killing homosexuals because of their orientation. These arguments posit that the attacker was so enraged by their victim's advances as to cause [[temporary insanity]], leaving them unable to stop themselves or tell right from wrong. In these cases, if the loss of faculties is proven, or sympathized to the jury, an initially severe sentence may be significantly reduced. In several [[common law countries]], the mitigatory defense of [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]] has been used in violent attacks against LGBT persons, which has led several [[Australia|Australian]] states and territories to modify their legislation, in order to prevent or reduce the using of this legal defense in cases of violent responses to non-violent homosexual advances.

There have been several highly publicized cases where people convicted of violence against LGBT people have received shorter sentences. One such case is that of Kenneth Brewer. On 30 September 1997, he met Stephen Bright at a local gay bar. He bought the younger man drinks and they later went back to Brewer's apartment. While there, Brewer made a sexual advance toward Bright, and Bright beat him to death. Bright was initially charged with [[second-degree murder]], but he was eventually convicted of third-degree [[assault]] and was sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reasonable"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Cynthia|title=Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom|url=https://books.google.com/?id=se0xg_yvRSMC&amp;pg=PA91 |publisher=[[NYU Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8147-5115-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cases like Bright's are not isolated. In 2001, [[Aaron Webster]] was beaten to death by a group of youths armed with baseball bats and a pool cue while hanging around an area of [[Stanley Park]] frequented by gay men. Ryan Cran was convicted of [[manslaughter]] in the case in 2004 and released on parole in 2009 after serving only 4 years of his six-year sentence.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; Two youths were tried under Canada's [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]] and sentenced to three years after pleading guilty. A fourth assailant was [[acquitted]].&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

Judges are not immune to letting their own prejudices affect their judgment either. In 1988, [[LGBT rights in Texas|Texas]] Judge Jack Hampton gave a man 30 years for killing two gay men, instead of the life sentence requested by the prosecutor. After handing down his judgment, he said: "I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage boys ...[I] put prostitutes and gays at about the same level ... and I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute."&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/10/23news.html|title=Asking for it|last=Stryker|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Salon Magazine]]|date=23 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, a [[LGBT rights in Florida|Florida]] judge trying a case concerning the beating to death of a gay man asked the prosecutor, "That's a crime now, to beat up a homosexual?"  The prosecutor responded, "Yes, sir. And it's also a crime to kill them."  "Times have really changed," the judge replied. The judge, Daniel Futch, maintained that he was joking, but was removed from the case.&lt;ref name="ALTS"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hate Crimes: a reference handbook|last=Altschiller|first=Donald|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;

[[Gay pride parade|LGBT Pride Parades]] often attract violence because of their public nature. Though many countries where such events take place attempt to provide police protection to participants, some would prefer that the parades not happen, and police either ignore or encourage violent protesters. The country of [[LGBT rights in Moldova|Moldova]] has shown particular contempt to marchers, shutting down official requests to hold parades and allowing protesters to intimidate and harm any who try to march anyway. In 2007, after being denied a request to hold a parade, a small group of LGBT people tried to hold a small gathering. They were surrounded by a group twice their size who shouted derogatory things at them and pelted them with eggs. The gathering proceeded even so, and they tried to lay flowers at the Monument to the Victims of Repression. They were denied the opportunity, however, by a large group of police claiming they needed permission from [[city hall]].&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

The following year, a parade was again attempted. A bus carried approximately 60 participants to the capital, but before they could disembark, an angry crowd surrounded the bus. They shouted things like "let's get them out and beat them up", and "beat them to death, don't let them escape" at the frightened passengers. The mob told the activists that if they wanted to leave the bus unharmed, they would have to destroy all of their pride materials. The passengers complied and the march was called off. All the while, police stood passively about 100 meters away, taking no action even though passengers claimed at least nine emergency calls were made to police while on the bus.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Christian|title=Gay Pride Parade Trapped on Bus|publisher=SameSame|date=May 12, 2008|url=http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028012532/http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm|archivedate=October 28, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=67 GenderDoc-M|title=Moldovan Gay Pride Threatened, Cops Refuse Protection for Marchers|date=May 11, 2008|url=http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2008/05/moldovan-gay-pride-threatened-cops.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia]]'s officials are similarly averse to [[LGBT culture in Russia|Pride Parades]]. [[Mayor of Moscow|Mayor]] of [[Moscow]] [[Yury Luzhkov]] has repeatedly banned marches, calling them "[[satan]]ic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ireland|first=Doug|title=Moscow Pride Banned Again|publisher=UK Gay News|date=May 17, 2007|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/08/May/3107.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304181750/http://ukgaynews.org.uk/archive/08/may/3107.htm|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pride participants instead tried to peacefully assemble and deliver a petition to city hall regarding the [[right of assembly]] and [[Freedom of speech by country#Russia|freedom of expression]]. They were met by [[skinheads]] and other protesters, and police who had closed off the square and immediately arrested activists as they entered. As some were being arrested, other participants were attacked by protesters. Police did nothing. Around eleven women and two men were arrested and left in the heat, denied medical attention, and verbally abused by police officers. The officers told the women, "No one needs lesbians, no one will ever get you out of here." When participants were released from custody hours later, they were pelted by eggs and shouted at by protesters who had been waiting.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Have the Upper Hand: Freedom of assembly in Russia and the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people|date=June 2007|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[ILGA-Europe]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202073400/http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|archivedate=2008-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT rights in Hungary|Hungary]], on the other hand, has tried to afford the best protection they can to marchers, but cannot stem the flow of violence. In 2008, hundreds of people participated in the [[Budapest Pride|Budapest Dignity March]]. Police, on alert due to attacks on two LGBT-affiliated businesses earlier in the week, erected high metal barriers on either side of the street the march was to take place on. Hundreds of angry protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at police in retaliation. A police van was set on fire and two police officers were injured in the attacks. During the parade itself, protesters threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s, eggs and firecrackers at marchers. At least eight participants were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peto, Sandor and Krisztina Than|title=Anti-gay violence mars Hungarian parade|publisher=The Star Online|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/6/worldupdates/2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014221138/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F7%2F6%2Fworldupdates%2F2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|archivedate=October 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-five people were detained in connection with the attacks, and observers called the spectacle "the worst violence during the dozen years the Gay Pride Parade has taken place in Budapest".&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bos|first=Stefan|title=Violent Protests Disrupt Hungary's Gay Rights Parade|publisher=VOA News|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802145651/http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm|archivedate=August 2, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Israel]], three marchers in a [[Jerusalem gay pride parade|gay pride parade in Jerusalem]] on June 30, 2005 were stabbed by [[Yishai Shlisel]], a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jew]]. Shlisel claimed he had acted "in the name of God". He was charged with attempted murder.Ten years later, On 30 July 2015, [[Jerusalem gay pride parade#2015 attack|six marchers were injured]], again by [[Yishai Shlisel]] when he stabbed them. It was three weeks after he was released from jail. One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the [[Hadassah Medical Center]] three days later, on 2 August 2015. Shortly after, Prime Minister Netanyahu offered his condolences, adding "We will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law."

===Advocacy in song lyrics===
[[File:Buju Banton (Apollo theater, 2007).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Buju Banton]], a Jamaican musician, performing in 2007.]]
As a result of the strong anti-homosexual culture in [[Jamaica]], many [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] artists, such as [[Buju Banton]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Sizzla]], have published song lyrics advocating violence against homosexuals.
Similarly, [[hip-hop]] music occasionally includes aggressively homophobic lyrics,&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since appeared to reform.

Banton wrote a song when he was 15 years old that became a hit when he released it years later in 1992 called "Boom Bye Bye". The song is about murdering homosexuals and "advocated the shooting of gay men, pouring acid on them and burning them alive."&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; A song by Elephant Man proclaims: "When you hear a lesbian getting raped/It's not our fault ... Two women in bed/That's two sodomites who should be dead."&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;

Canadian activists have sought to deport reggae artists from the country due to homophobic content in some of their songs, which they say promote anti-gay violence. In the UK, [[Scotland Yard]] has investigated reggae [[lyrics]] and Sizzla was barred from entering the [[United Kingdom]] in 2004 over accusations his music promotes murder.&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/coalition-seeks-ejection-of-reggae-stars-over-anti-gay-lyrics-1.650484|title=Coalition seeks ejection of reggae stars over anti-gay lyrics|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay rights advocates have started the group [[Stop Murder Music]] to combat what they say is the promotion of hate and violence by artists. The group organized protests, causing some venues to refuse to allow the targeted artists to perform, and the loss of sponsors. In 2007, the group asked reggae artists to promise "not to produce music or make public statements inciting hatred against gay people. Neither can they authorise the re-release of previous homophobic songs." Several artists signed that agreement, including Buju Banton, Beenie Man, Sizzla and [[Capleton]],&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; but some later denied signing it.&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9251.html|title=Immigration minister criticised for letting homophobic artist into Canada|first=Tony|last=Grew|publisher=[[Pink News]]|date=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, skinheads in North America who promoted emerging neo-Nazi pop culture and [[Racism in North America|racist]] rock songs increasingly went to punk rock concerts that with anti-gay music advocating violence.

==Motivations==
===Macho culture and social homophobia===
{{Original research section|date=April 2013}}
{{main|Homophobia}}
The vast majority of homophobic criminal assault is perpetrated by male aggressors on male victims, and is connected to aggressive heterosexual [[machismo]] or [[male chauvinism]].
Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay.
Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy J. Chodorow. [http://www.cyberpsych.org/homophobia/chodorow.htm Statement in a public forum on homophobia by The American Psychoanalytic Foundation, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/050802_masculinity.html|title=Masculinity Challenged, Men Prefer War and SUVs|work=LiveScience.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, allegedly homophobia is rampant in sports, and in the [[subculture]] of its supporters, that are considered [[stereotype|stereotypically]] "male", such as [[association football|football]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/34787/fans-culture-hard-to-change "Fans' culture hard to change"]&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobia does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexual in a [[heteronormative]] culture, thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person.

Various [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes repression, denial or [[reaction formation]].&lt;ref&gt;West, D.J. ''Homosexuality re-examined.''

====Religious texts====
{{Religious text primary|section|date=May 2016}}
Some verses of the [[Bible and violence|Bible]] are often interpreted as forbidding homosexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]].|[[Leviticus 18]]:22}}

{{quote|And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.|[[Kedoshim|Leviticus 20]]:13}}

The above verses are the cause of tension between the devout of the [[Abrahamic religions]] and members of the LGBT community. It is viewed by many as an outright condemnation of homosexual acts between men, and, more commonly in ancient times than today, justification for violence.

In ''Religion Dispatches'' magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge argues that the six or so verses that are often cited to condemn LGBT people are referring instead to "abusive sex." She states that the Bible has no condemnation for "loving, committed, gay and lesbian relationships" and that [[Jesus]] was silent on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/802/the_%22gay%22_princess_di_bible/|title=The "Gay" Princess Di Bible|author=Candace Chellew-Hodge|work=Religion Dispatches|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian groups advocate [[conversion therapy]] and promote [[ex-gay]] groups.

The [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church teaches]] that a homosexual orientation is not sinful and that LGBT people are to be treated with compassion and respect, as all others are.  It also [[theology of the body|teaches that sex]] is meant to be had between opposite sex spouses.  A 1992 letter from [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]], the future Pope Benedict XVI, condemned [[gay bashing]].&lt;ref name=reltol/&gt;  It said that LGBT people "have the same rights as all persons including the right of not being treated in a manner which offends their personal dignity."&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;  It adds that 
 	
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word, in action and in law.&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;&lt;ref name=assumption/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in the same letter Ratzinger suggested that anti-gay violence could be the fault of victims if they push too hard to seek equal rights, thereby absolving responsibility by those who conduct violent behaviour:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When civil legislation is introduced to protect behavior to which no one has any conceivable right, neither the church nor society at large should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground and irrational and violent reactions increase.&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Theology of Pope Benedict XVI#Homosexuality and LGBT rights|Pope Benedict XVI]], then the leader of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] stated that "protecting" humanity from homosexuality was just as important as saving the world from [[climate change]] and that all relationships beyond traditional heterosexual ones are a "destruction of God's work."&lt;ref name="pope" /&gt;{{deadlink|date=July 2018}} [[Pope Francis]] has been seen as [[Pastoral care for gay Catholics|more welcoming to LGBT people]], saying to a gay man that "God made you like this.

[[Evangelicalism#Africa|Evangelicals in Africa]] sometimes use religion to justify violence against LGBT people and criminalizing homosexual behavior. [[Archbishop]]s [[Peter Akinola]] of [[Christianity in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and Henry Orombi of [[Religion in Uganda#Christianity|Uganda]] would not condemn violence against gays and lesbians when questioned on the issue at the [[Global Anglican Future Conference]].&lt;ref name="ekklesia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/7382|title=Evangelical leader criticises failure to condemn violence against gays|publisher=Ekklesia|date=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Russell, Chief Executive of [[Church Army]], expressed outrage over their resistance, stating "Quite honestly [refusal to condemn violence against gay people in their home countries] is disgraceful, it sullies their cause, and is totally un-Christian. You cannot justify violence in God's name. Period. [...] Those who perpetrate violence against gay people in Africa now can use this silence to justify their behaviour. Christians must speak up and say this is wrong."&lt;ref name="ekklesia" /&gt;

====Islam====
{{See also|Islam and homosexuality}}
The [[Quran and violence|Quran]], the book of Islam, cites the story of the "people of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]]" (also known as the people of [[Sodom and Gomorrah#Islamic|Sodom and Gomorrah]]), destroyed by the [[Anger#Islam|wrath]] of [[God in Islam|Allah]] because they engaged in [[Lust#Islam|lustful]] carnal acts between men.

[[Islam#Scholars|Scholars of Islam]], such as [[Shaykh al-Islām]] [[Imam Malik]], and [[Imam Shafi]] amongst others, ruled that Islam disallowed homosexuality and ordained capital punishment for a person guilty of it.&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|title=Homosexuality and Lesbianism: Sexual Perversions|publisher=IslamOnline|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603002449/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|archivedate=2010-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal punishment for [[Islamic views on anal sex|sodomy]] has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe [[Capital and corporal punishment in Islam|capital punishment]]; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment. Homosexual activity is a [[Islamic criminal jurisprudence|crime]] and forbidden in most [[Islam by country|Muslim-majority countries]]. In some relatively [[Islam and secularism|secular]] Muslim-majority countries such as [[LGBT rights in Indonesia|Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="RoughGuideSEAsia2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rough Guide to South East Asia: Third Edition|page=74|url=http://www.roughguides.com/|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd|isbn=1-84353-437-1|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT rights in Jordan|Jordan]] and [[LGBT rights in Turkey|Turkey]], this is not the case.

The [[Quran]], much like the [[Bible]] and [[Torah]], has a vague condemnation of homosexuality and how it should be dealt with, leaving it open to interpretation. For this reason, Islamic jurists have turned to the collections of the [[hadith]] (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) and [[Sunnah]] (accounts of his life). These, on the other hand, are perfectly clear and particularly harsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bosworth, Ed. C. and E. van Donzel|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Leiden|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi|Ibn al-Jawzi]] records Muhammad as cursing sodomites in several hadith, and recommending the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in same-sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA89|last=Wafer|first=Jim|title=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality|page=89 |publisher=New York University Press|year=1997|accessdate=2010-07-24|isbn=978-0-8147-7468-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]] again reports Muhammad as having prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive partner: "Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lot, kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done."&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"/&gt; The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dynes|first=Wayne|title=Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality|location=New York|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it must be noted that these views vary depending upon sect. It is noteworthy to point out that Quranists (those who do not integrate the aforementioned Hadiths into their belief system) do not advocate capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/more/traits/homosexuality.html|title=Homosexuality prohibited in Submission (Islam)|website=www.masjidtucson.org|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|imams]] still preach their views, stating that homosexuals and "women who act like men" should be executed under the Islamic law.

====Judaism====
{{See also|Judaism and homosexuality}}
In [[Judaism]], the [[Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism|death penalty]] against homosexuality has not been used in practice for more than 2000 years, though many [[Jewish religious movements|movements]] still view homosexual acts as sinful. [[Orthodox Judaism]] [[Homosexuality and Judaism#Orthodox Jewish views|generally prohibits homosexual conduct]]. While there is disagreement about which acts come under core prohibitions, all of Orthodox Judaism puts certain core homosexual acts, including [[Sodomy#Judaism|sodomy]] in the category of ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor''&amp;mdash;"die rather than transgress"&amp;mdash;the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts (also including [[Thou shalt not kill#Jewish doctrine|murder]], [[Idolatry in Judaism|idolatry]], [[Thou shalt not commit adultery#In Judaism|adultery]], and [[Jewish views on incest|incest]]) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of [[self-sacrifice under Jewish Law]] to die rather than do.
