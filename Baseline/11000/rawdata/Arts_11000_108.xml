'''Books Through Bars''' is an [[United States|American]] organization that works to provide quality reading material to prisoners in [[Pennsylvania]] and surrounding states. [[New Society Publishers]] of [[Philadelphia]] founded Books Through Bars in 1990.&lt;ref name= history&gt;"[http://booksthroughbars.org/about/history/ History]". ''Books Through Bars''. Retrieved December 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Books Through Bars was separately incorporated as a nonprofit organization on March 19, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.corporations.pa.gov/search/CorpSearch Books Through Bars: Entity Number 2994731]". ''Business Entity Details''. Pennsylvania Department of State. Retrieved December 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There are approximately 30 similar, but unaffiliated, organizations throughout the United States.

Because prisoners in American [[prison]]s are not able to receive books from sources other than recognized publishers, bookstores, or other legitimate distributors, those without the financial resources to buy books have very limited access to them. Prison libraries are not being funded, in part because reading material is widely seen as irrelevant to a "mostly uneducated and indeed largely illiterate prison population".&lt;ref name=Scalia&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scalia|first1=Antonin|title=Lewis v.

New Society Publishers began its program after it began receiving letters from indigent prisoners, and provides donated books to individual prisoners, prison libraries, and [[halfway house]]s.&lt;ref name=Donating&gt;{{cite web|title=Donating Books|url=http://booksthroughbars.org/donate/books/|website=Books Through Bars|accessdate=30 June 2014|quote=Dropping off books...

The organization distributes several hundred packages per month. It also sponsors regular public events relating to issues such as [[human rights]], the [[war on drugs]], and [[prison reform]].

[[File:Chesthetica901.png|thumb|320px|CHESTHETICA v9.01, a chess aesthetics evaluating software]]

'''[[Chess]] [[aesthetics]]''' or beauty in chess is generally appreciated by both players and composers. This is evident, for example, in {{chessgloss|brilliancy prizes}}&lt;ref&gt;Damsky, I. (2002). Chess Brilliancy. Everyman Publishers, London, England.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avni, A. (1998). Creative Chess, Expanded Edition. Everyman Publishers, London, England. {{ISBN|978-1-85744-149-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov, A. (1925). Красота в шахматной игре, Beauty at the Chess Game, (in Russian), Leningrad, Russia.&lt;/ref&gt; awarded to some games in certain [[Chess tournament|tournaments]] and also in the world of [[chess composition]]. There are many books published featuring chess problems or puzzles that emphasize its aesthetic aspect.&lt;ref&gt;Levitt, J. and Friedgood D. (2008). Secrets of Spectacular Chess, 2nd Edition (Expanded), 1 May, Everyman Chess, London, England. {{ISBN|978-1-85744-551-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howard, K. (1967). The Enjoyment of Chess Problems. Dover Publications, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipton, M., Matthews, R. C. O. and Rice, J. (1965).Chess Problems: Introduction to an Art, Citadel Press, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest is from the 9th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Adli, Book of Chess (in Arabic), as referenced in Nowakowski, R. J. (1998). Games of No Chance. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetics in chess can be both a source of pleasure for humans and also instruction, as compositions or games featuring it typically illustrate original ideas or new instantiations of old ones. A good chess problem composer, however, is not necessarily a good player.

Factors about a game or move sequence (also referred to as a ''[[Combination (chess)|combination]]'') that might cause it to be regarded as 'brilliant' by most players include, among other things: expediency, disguise, sacrifice, correctness, preparation, paradox, unity and originality.

* ''Expediency'' refers to a move's effectiveness in achieving something tangible, like checkmate or a decisive {{chessgloss|material}} gain.
* ''Disguise'' occurs when a move played (usually the {{chessprobgloss|key}} move) does not expose the solution immediately.
* ''Sacrifice'' refers to the exchange of a more powerful piece for a weaker one, but can also mean the exchange of other less tangible advantages, like {{chessgloss|mobility}}.
* ''Correctness'' simply means the solution should work against any defense. (A plus but not always possible in real games.)
* ''Preparation'' means that the aesthetic perceived—say, in a particular tactical combination—was achieved in great part due to the strategic play preceding it.&lt;ref&gt;Sukhin, I. (2007). Chess Gems: 1000 Combinations You Should Know, Mongoose Press, Massachusetts, USA. {{ISBN|978-0-9791482-5-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''Paradox'' refers to the range of things that violate 'good practice' in chess, for example, the deliberate exposure of one's king.
* ''Unity'' refers to the cooperation between pieces toward the attainment of a specific goal (e.g. [[checkmate]], winning material, controlling more {{chessgloss|space}}).
* ''Originality'' means something the observer has not seen before, and must therefore rely heavily on personal experience.

[[Chess_problem#Beauty_in_chess_problems|Composition conventions]] such as not having any [[Check (chess)|checks]] or {{chessgloss|captures}} in the first (i.e. key) move, and the use of variations to illustrate a particular theme (e.g. [[zugzwang]], [[Pin (chess)|pin]]), also play a role in the aesthetics of the game.

Conceptually, a 'common ground' of aesthetics between the domains of real (e.g. tournament) games and compositions can be established. These are beauty characteristics that apply approximately equally to both domains; examples include [[heuristic]] violations, economy and material sacrifice. This common ground is useful in computational models of aesthetics in the game because it helps in experiments comparing the beauty of compositions (on average, considered more beautiful) against the beauty of real games (on average, considered less beautiful).&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal, M. A. M. (2008). A Discrete Computational Aesthetics Model for a Zero-Sum Perfect Information Game, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230855649_A_Discrete_Computational_Aesthetics_Model_for_A_Zero-Sum_Perfect_Information_Game PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Some factors that pertain solely to real games (e.g. pressure under [[Chess#Time_control|time control]]) or compositions (e.g. avoidance of [[castling]] moves) may be conflated with ''aesthetics'' in the game—and perhaps to some degree this is justifiable;&lt;ref&gt;Humble, P.N. (1995). The Aesthetics of Chess: A Reply to Ravilious. British Journal of Aesthetics, vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 390–94.&lt;/ref&gt; however, they would lie outside the common ground described above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1552">'''Decadent Action''' was a mock "consumer terrorist group"[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/individual/743579] and "High Street anarchist-guerrilla organisation"[http://www.monoculartimes.co.uk/counterculture/decadentaction.shtml] (or [[culture jammers]]) which argued that only a credit collapse through excessive [[consumer spending]] could bring about the end of [[capitalism]]. It argued that bringing about excessive [[inflation]] through unrestrained consumer spending was the sole lever which could precipitate the economic collapse upon which any revolutionary action is predicated. Therefore it promoted the idea of irresponsible credit and excessive spending on hedonistic pursuits to achieve its goals.

Its manifesto was first published in ''[[The Idler (1993)|The Idler]]'' magazine and then [[Stewart Home]]'s ''Mind Invaders: A Reader in Psychic Warfare, Cultural Sabotage And Semiotic Terrorism'' (1997). The group was notable for organising the first Phone-in Sick Day, which saw thousands of [[British Airways]] and Irish [[Garda Síochána|Garda]] call in sick to work[http://www.gatt.org/sick2000.html].

'''''Eight Elvises''''' is a 1963 [[silkscreen]] painting by American [[pop artist]] [[Andy Warhol]] of [[Elvis Presley]]. In 2008 it was sold by [[Annibale Berlingieri]] for [[USD|$]]100 million to a private buyer, making the painting the most valuable work by Andy Warhol at the time. The current owner and location of the painting, which has not been seen publicly since the 1960s, are unknown, although it is believed the buyer was the Royal Qatari family. 

==Background==

''Eight Elvises'' is composed of eight identical, overlapping images of [[Elvis Presley]] in [[cowboy]] attire, silkscreened over a silver background.&lt;ref name="MC_354freddys swag"&gt;McCarthy (2006), 354&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Andrew|title=The $100m Warhol|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/the-100m-warhol-1830661.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was originally a portion of a {{convert|37|ft|m|abbr=out|adj=mid|long}} piece, containing sixteen copies of Elvis, that was showcased in a 1963 exhibition at the [[Ferus Gallery]] in Los Angeles. The exhibition, Warhol's second at the Ferus, contained several other pieces using the same image of Elvis, as well as a series of [[head shot]]s of [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref name="MC_354freddys swag" /&gt; The images of Elvis were taken from a [[film still|publicity still]] from the movie ''[[Flaming Star]]''.&lt;ref name=MC_363&gt;McCarthy (2006), 363&lt;/ref&gt; When the gallery was dismantled, the section with eight images of Elvis became a distinct piece, measuring {{convert|6+1/2|by|12|ft|cm|abbr=out}}.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy (2006), 356&lt;/ref&gt; While Warhol created 22 versions of the painting with two Elvises on it, known as ''Double Elvis'', only one piece titled ''Eight Elvises'' was created.&lt;ref name=Johnson /&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|last=Lerner|first=George|title=Warhol 'Double Elvis' goes for $37 million|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/09/us/new-york-warhol-double-elvis/|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Entry of Christ into Jerusalem''''' is an 1125 [[fresco]] by the [[Master of San Baudelio de Berlanga]], originally located at [[San Baudelio de Berlanga]] but now on display in the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. It depicts [[Christ]] and seven [[disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] entering [[Jerusalem]] to the acclaim of its inhabitants.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
This fresco is in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style popular in northern [[Spain]] during the twelfth century. The life-size figures, extending the entire height of the fresco, are marked by curvilinear patterning, schematic drapery folds, and repeated figures creating abstract designs.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus, riding an ass and her foal, raises his hands to bless the multitudes come to greet his arrival. These multitudes have been condensed to two kneeling figures spreading branches before him.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

==Historical information==
San Baudelio was constructed in the eleventh century, but the frescoes were not added for another century. There are two distinct cycles: the upper walls were covered in colorful scenes from Christ's life, while the lower walls depicted hunt scenes and exotic animals indicative of the [[Islamic]] influence in the region.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; While the two sets of images have very different subjects, there are many indications that they were created simultaneously, by artists from the same atelier if not the very same artist. The frescoes have a similar quality of line, and the draftsmanship of various human and animal figures seems related. They were also created using the same techniques: initial sketches in [[buon fresco]] and [[fresco-secco]], details added in [[tempera]], polished with [[limewater]].&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John P.|title=The Art of Medieval Spain: A.D. 500-1200|year=1993|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|location=[[New York, New York]]|isbn=0870996878|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdXQnaME1gMC&amp;pg=PA228 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although seemingly at odds, the two sets of frescoes, religious and secular, worked together quite well considering the time and place of their creation. The unstable border between Christian and Muslim regions saw much interpenetration of ideas and people. The [[Mozarab]]ic people in the region, who practiced Christianity with the trappings of Arab culture, would have been ideally served by San Baudelio's mixture of cultures and iconographies.&lt;ref name=garnett/&gt;

===Location history===
The remoteness of [[Berlanga de Duero]] and inaccessibility of its church helped the frescoes survive for centuries, protecting them from everything but the weather.&lt;ref name=day/&gt; In 1927, the villagers of Berlanga sold the frescoes that had not been destroyed to an art dealer named Leon Levi. They were then dispersed to museums around the world, including the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]], and the [[Prado Museum]].&lt;ref name=garnett&gt;{{cite web|last=Garnett|first=Rachel|title=The Fresco Paintings of San Baudelio|url=http://www.unt.edu/honors/eaglefeather/2005_Issue/2005_PDFs/Garnett.pdf|publisher=[[University of North Texas]]|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
The IMA acquired ''Entry of Christ into Jerusalem'' in 1957 as a gift of G. H. A. Clowes and Elijah B. Martindale. It was given the accession number 57.151 and hangs in the Irving M. Fauvre Gallery by its sister fresco, ''Marriage at Cana''.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry of Christ into Jerusalem|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/entry-christ-jerusalem-master-san-baudelio-de-berlanga|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2492">'''George Dickie''' (born 12 August 1926 in [[Palmetto, Florida]]) is a Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[University of Illinois at Chicago]].&lt;ref name="faculty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tigger.uic.edu/~gdickie/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212134133/http://tigger.uic.edu/~gdickie/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 December 2012 |title=George Dickie faculty page |website=University of Illinois at Chicago |accessdate=5 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His specialities include aesthetics, philosophy of art and Eighteenth Century theories of taste.

==Education and career==
He received a BA from [[Florida State University]] in 1949 and a PhD from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1959.&lt;ref name = "faculty" /&gt; He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/78fellow.html |title=1978 U.S. and Canadian Fellows |website=John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation |accessdate=5 May 2014 via Wayback Machine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312160335/http://www.gf.org/78fellow.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as President of the Illinois Philosophy Association (1990–91) and President of the [[American Society for Aesthetics]] (1993–94).

==Work==
He is an influential philosopher of art working in the analytical tradition. His [[institutional theory of art]] inspired both supporters who produced variations on the theory as well as detractors.

One of his more influential works is ''The Century of Taste'' (1996), an inquiry into several eighteenth-century philosophers' treatments of the subject.  The bulk of the work is devoted to championing [[David Hume]]'s treatment of the subject over that of [[Immanuel Kant]].  A review of the work can be found in ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', 107:3 (July, 1998).

The [[literature|literary]] concept of the '''heteronym''' refers to one or more imaginary character(s) created by a writer to write in different styles. Heteronyms differ from [[pen names]] (or [[pseudonym]]s, from the Greek words for "false" and "name") in that the latter are just false names, while the former are characters that have their own supposed physiques, biographies, and writing styles.&lt;ref&gt;ZENITH, Richard (2002), ''The Book of Disquiet'', Penguin Classics, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heteronyms were named and developed by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] writer and poet [[Fernando Pessoa]] in the early 20th Century, but they were thoroughly explored by the Danish philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]] in the 19th century and have also been used by other writers.

==Pessoa's heteronyms==
In Pessoa's case, there are at least 70 heteronyms (according to the latest count by Pessoa's editor Teresa Rita Lopes). Some of them are relatives or know each other; they criticise and translate each other's works. Pessoa's three chief heteronyms are Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis and [[Álvaro de Campos]]; the latter two consider the former their master. There are also two whom Pessoa called ''semi-heteronyms'', [[Bernardo Soares]] and the Baron of Teive, who are semi-autobiographical characters who write in prose, "a mere mutilation" of the Pessoa personality. There is, lastly, an ''orthonym'', [[Fernando Pessoa]], the namesake of the author, who also considers Caeiro his master.

The heteronyms dialogue with each other and even with Pessoa in what he calls "the theatre of being" or "drama in people". They sometimes intervened in Pessoa's social life: during Pessoa's only attested romance, a jealous Campos wrote letters to the girl, who enjoyed the game and wrote back.

Pessoa, also an amateur astrologer, created in 1915 the heteronym Raphael Baldaya, a long bearded astrologer. He elaborated horoscopes of his main heteronyms in order to determine their personalities.

'''Fernando Pessoa on the heteronyms'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;How do I write in the name of these three? Caeiro, through sheer and unexpected inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that I’m going to write in his name. Ricardo Reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode. Campos, when I feel a sudden impulse to write and don’t know what. (My semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles Álvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy, so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He’s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn’t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He’s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same – whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as "me myself" instead of "I myself", etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:::: Fernando Pessoa, Letter to Adolfo Casais Monteiro, 13.01.1935, in ''The Book of Disquiet'', tr. Richard Zenith, Penguin Classics, 2002, p. 474.

'''George Steiner on the heteronyms'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Pseudonymous writing is not rare in literature or philosophy (Kierkegaard provides a celebrated instance). 'Heteronyms', as Pessoa called and defined them, are something different and exceedingly strange. For each of his 'voices', Pessoa conceived a highly distinctive poetic idiom and technique, a complex biography, a context of literary influence and polemics and, most arrestingly of all, subtle interrelations and reciprocities of awareness. Octavio Paz defines Caeiro as 'everything that Pessoa is not and more'.

He is a man magnificently at home in nature, a virtuoso of pre-Christian innocence, almost a Portuguese teacher of Zen. Reis is a stoic Horatian, a pagan believer in fate, a player with classical myths less original than Caeiro, but more representative of modern symbolism. De Campos emerges as a Whitmanesque futurist, a dreamer in drunkenness, the Dionysian singer of what is oceanic and windswept in Lisbon. None of this triad resembles the metaphysical solitude, the sense of being an occultist medium which characterise Pessoa's 'own' intimate verse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:::: George Steiner, "A man of many parts", in ''The Observer'', Sunday, 3 June 2001.

'''Richard Zenith on the heteronyms'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Álvaro de Campos, the poet-persona who grew old with Pessoa and held a privileged place in his inventor’s hearts. Soares, the assistant bookkeeper and Campos, the naval engineer never met in the pen-and-paper drama of Pessoa’s heteronyms, who were frequently pitted against one other, but the two writer-characters were spiritual brothers, even if their worldly occupations were at odds. Campos wrote prose, as well as poetry, and much of it reads at it came, so to speak, from the hand of Soares. Pessoa was often unsure who was writing when he wrote, and it’s curious that the very first item among the more than 25,000 pieces that make up his archives in the National Library of Lisbon bears the heading  ''A. de C. (?) or B. de D.  (or something else).''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:::: Richard Zenith, introduction to ''The Book of Disquiet'', Penguin Classics, 2002, p. XI.

==Álvaro de Campos==
This heteronym was created by [[Fernando Pessoa]] as an ''[[alter ego]]'' who inherited his role from '''Alexander Search''' and this one from '''Charles Robert Anon'''. The latter was created when Pessoa lived in [[Durban]], while Search was created in 1906, when Pessoa was a student at Lisbon's University, in search of his Portuguese cultural identity, after his return from [[Durban]]. 

Anon was supposedly English, while Search, although English, was born in Lisbon. After the Portuguese republican revolution, in 1910, and consequent patriotic atmosphere, Pessoa dropped his English heteronyms and '''Álvaro de Campos''' was created as a Portuguese ''[[alter ego]]''. Álvaro de Campos, born in 1890, was supposedly a Portuguese naval engineer graduated in [[Glasgow]]. 

Campos sailed to the Orient, living experiences that he describes in his poem "Opiarium". He worked in London (1915), Barrow on Furness and Newcastle (1922), but became unemployed, and returned to Lisbon in 1926, the year of the military putsh that installed dictatorship. He also wrote "Lisbon Revisited (1923)" and "Lisbon Revisited (1926)".

Campos was a [[decadentism|decadent]] poet, but he embraced [[Futurism]]; his poetry was strongly influenced by [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Marinetti]]. He wrote the "Ode Triumphal" and "Ode Maritime", published in the literary journal ''[[Geração de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'', in 1915, and other unfinished. 

while unemployed in Lisbon, he became depressed, returning to [[Decadentism]] and [[Pessimism]]. 
Then he wrote his master work, "Tobacco Shop", published in 1933, in the literary journal ''[[Presença]]''.

==Alberto Caeiro==
Pessoa created this heteronym as "Master" of the other heteronyms and even Pessoa himself. 
This fictional character was born in 1889 and died in 1915, at 26, the same age of Pessoa's best friend [[Mário de Sá-Carneiro]], who killed himself in Paris, in 1916. Thus, Sá-Carneiro seems to have inspired, at least partially, Alberto Caeiro.
 
Caeiro was a humble man of poor education, but a great poet "naif", he was born in Lisbon, but lives almost his life in the countryside, Ribatejo, near Lisbon, where he died. However, his poetry is full of philosophy. He wrote "Poemas Inconjuntos" (Disconnected Poems) and "O Guardador de Rebanhos" (The Keeper of Sheep), published by [[Fernando Pessoa]] in his "Art Journal" ''Athena'' in 1924-25.

In a famous letter to the literary critic Adolfo Casais Monteiro, dated January 13, 1935, Pessoa describes his "triumphal day", Mach 8, 1914, when Caeiro "appeared", making him write down all the poetry of "The Keeper of Sheep" at once. Caeiro influenced the Neopaganism of Pessoa, and of the heteronyms António Mora and Ricardo Reis. Poetically, he influenced mainly the Neoclassicism of Reis, which is connected to Paganism.

==Ricardo Reis==

[[Image:Carta astral ricardo reis.jpg|thumb|300px|Astrological chart of the heteronym ''Ricardo Reis'' by Fernando Pessoa.]]

This heteronym was created by [[Fernando Pessoa|Pessoa]] as a Portuguese doctor born in [[Oporto]], in September 19, 1887. Reis supposedly studied at a boarding school run by [[Jesuit]]s in which he received a classical education. He was an amateur [[latinist]] and poet; politically a monarchist, he went into exile to Brazil after the defeat of a monarchical rebellion against the [[Portuguese Republic]] in 1919. Ricardo Reis reveals his [[Epicureanism]] and [[Stoicism]] in the "Odes by Ricardo Reis", published by [[Fernando Pessoa|Pessoa]] in 1924, in his literary journal ''Athena''.

Since [[Fernando Pessoa|Pessoa]] didn't determine the death of Reis, one can assume that he survived his author who died in 1935. In ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]'' (1984), Portuguese [[nobel prize]] [[José Saramago]] rebuilds, in his own personal outlook, the literary world of this heteronym after 1935, creating a dialog between Ricardo Reis and the ghost of his author.

== List of Pessoa's heteronyms ==

{| class="wikitable" border="1" width="100%"

! No. !! Name !! Type !! *Notes
|-
| 1 || Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa || himself || Commercial correspondent in Lisbon
|-
| 2 || Fernando Pessoa || orthonym || Poet and prose writer
|-
| 3 || Fernando Pessoa || autonym || Poet and prose writer
|-
| 4 || Fernando Pessoa || heteronym || Poet, a pupil of Alberto Caeiro

| 5 || Alberto Caeiro || heteronym || Poet, author of 'O guardador de Rebanhos','O Pastor Amoroso' and 'Poemas inconjuntos', master of Fernando Pessoa heteronyms, Álvaro de Campos, Ricardo Reis, António Mora and Coelho Pacheco
|-
| 6 || Ricardo Reis || heteronym || Poet and prose writer, author of 'Odes' and texts on the work of Alberto Caeiro. ''Biographical note'': (Oporto, 1887–1936). He graduated in medicine  and is an unconditional admirer of the Greek civilisation above all others, and considers himself to be an expatriate from Greece. Being a royalist he chooses to emigrate to Brazil in 1919 (Portuguese monarchy had been overthrown in 1910). In his neoclassical odes he ponders on the briefness of life, the inevitability of death and the helplessness of  the human condition. This “sad epicure” tries to find some contentment through the acceptance of fate and self-discipline lives by Horatio’s a motto: carpe diem (seize the day).  
|-
| 7 || Frederico  Reis || heteronym/para-heteronym || Essayist, brother of Ricardo Reis, upon whom he writes
|-
| 8 || Álvaro de Campos || heteronym || Poet and prose writer, a pupil of Alberto Caeiro. ''Biographical note'': Álvaro de Campos. (Tavira, Algarve, 1890 - ?). He studies naval engineering in Scotland. He feels a foreigner wherever he is. Suffocated by a tedious and monotonous existence, failing to see the meaning of life, he looks for new sensations and travels to the Far East. When he comes back he is a renewed man. He embraces the futuristic movement and worships industrialisation and scientific and technological progress, with its hectic relentless rhythm and continuous change. There is an ecstasy of the senses, his relationship with machines and charcoal and steel is almost erotic. But in the background of this modern world lurk the shadows of the assembly line, the pollution, the emptiness of material things. The darkness of what is to come —eventually Campos tires. In his third phase, profoundly disenchanted with the present, he evokes the long-gone days of his perfectly happy childhood.

'''Sir Joshua Reynolds''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|RA|FRS|FRSA}} (16 July 1723 – 23 February 1792) was an English painter, specialising in portraits.[[John Russell (art critic) | John Russell]] said he was one of the major European painters of the 18th century. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/arts/art-view-anybody-who-was-somebody-knocked-at-his-door.html|title=ART VIEW; ANYBODY WHO WAS SOMEBODY KNOCKED AT HIS DOOR|first=John|last=Russell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted the [[Grand manner|"Grand Style"]] in painting which depended on idealization of the imperfect. He was a founder and first president of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] in 1769. In 2018, the 250th anniversary of the founding of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in [[London]], UK was celebrated, of which Sir Joshua Reynolds was the first president. 

==Early life==
[[File:Self-portrait c.1747-9 by Joshua Reynolds (2).jpg|thumb|Joshua Reynolds, ''Self-portrait'', aged about 24]]
[[File:PlymptonOldGrammarSchool Devon.JPG|thumb|[[Plympton Grammar School|Old Grammar School, Plympton]], founded 1658, built 1664, attended by Joshua Reynolds whose father was headmaster]]
Reynolds was born in [[Plympton]], [[Devon]], on 16 July 1723&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; the third son of the Rev. Samuel Reynolds, master of the [[Plympton Grammar School|Plympton Free Grammar School]] in the town. His father had been a fellow of [[Balliol College]], Oxford, but did not send any of his sons to the university.&lt;ref name=penny1&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Ambitious Man|first=Nicholas|last=Penny|pages=17–18|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of his sisters was [[Mary Palmer]] (1716–1794), seven years his senior, author of ''Devonshire Dialogue'', whose fondness for drawing is said to have had much influence on him when a boy. In 1740 she provided £60, half of the premium paid to [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]] the portrait-painter, for Joshua's pupilage, and nine years later advanced money for his expenses in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Elizabeth, Biography of Mary Palmer, Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Vol.43&lt;/ref&gt; His other siblings included [[Frances Reynolds]] and [[Elizabeth Johnson (pamphleteer)|Elizabeth Johnson]].

As a boy, he came under the influence of [[Zachariah Mudge (clergyman)|Zachariah Mudge]], whose Platonistic philosophy stayed with him all his life. Reynolds made extracts in his [[commonplace book]] from [[Theophrastus]], [[Plutarch]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Marcus Antonius]], [[Ovid]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Milton]], [[Alexander Pope]], [[John Dryden]], [[Joseph Addison]], [[Richard Steele]], [[Aphra Behn]], and passages on art theory by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Charles Alphonse Du Fresnoy]], and [[André Félibien]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Martin Postle, ‘[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23429 Reynolds, Sir  Joshua  (1723–1792)]’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2009. Retrieved 24 Sep 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The work that came to have the most influential impact on Reynolds was [[Jonathan Richardson]]'s ''An Essay on the Theory of Painting'' (1715). Reynolds' annotated copy was lost for nearly two hundred years until it appeared in a Cambridge bookshop, inscribed with the signature ‘J. Reynolds Pictor’, and is now in the collection of the Royal Academy of Arts, London.&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Joshua Reynolds by Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|150px|Self-portrait, aged 17, entitled, ''Uffizi Self-portrait'']]
Having shown an early interest in art, Reynolds was apprenticed in 1740 to the fashionable London portrait painter [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]], who had been born in Devon.&lt;ref name=penny1/&gt; Hudson had a collection of Old Master drawings, including some by [[Guercino]], of which  Reynolds made copies.&lt;ref name=penny1/&gt;  Although apprenticed to Hudson for four years, Reynolds remained with him only until summer 1743.&lt;ref name=penny1/&gt; Having left Hudson, Reynolds worked for some time as a portrait-painter in Plymouth Dock (now [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]]). He returned to London before the end of 1744, but following his father's death in late 1745 he shared a house in Plymouth Dock with his sisters.&lt;ref name=penny1/&gt;

In 1749, Reynolds met Commodore [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]], who invited him to join [[HMS Centurion (1732)|HMS ''Centurion'']], of which he had command, on a voyage to the Mediterranean. While with the ship he visited Lisbon, Cadiz, Algiers, and Minorca. From Minorca he travelled to Livorno in Italy, and then to Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, pp. 35–7&lt;/ref&gt; where he spent two years,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, p.39&lt;/ref&gt; studying the Old Masters and acquiring a taste for the "Grand Style".{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Lord Edgcumbe, who had known Reynolds as a boy and introduced him to Keppel, suggested he should study with [[Pompeo Batoni]], the leading painter in Rome, but Reynolds replied that he had nothing to learn from him.&lt;ref name=penny1/&gt; While in Rome he suffered a severe cold, which left him partially deaf, and, as a result, he began to carry a small [[ear trumpet]] with which he is often pictured.

Reynolds travelled homeward overland via Florence, Bologna, Venice,&lt;ref&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, pp. 62–5&lt;/ref&gt; and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, p.86&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by [[Giuseppe Filippo Liberati Marchi|Giuseppe Marchi]], then aged about 17.&lt;ref name=marchi/&gt; Apart from a brief interlude in 1770, Marchi remained in Reynolds' employment as a studio assistant for the rest of  the artist's career.&lt;ref name=marchi&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Giuseppe Marchi|page=181|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his arrival in England in October 1752, Reynolds spent three months in Devon,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, p.89&lt;/ref&gt; before establishing himself in London, where he remained for the rest of his life. He took rooms in [[St Martin's Lane]], before moving to Great Newport Street, his sister Frances acted as his housekeeper.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He achieved success rapidly, and was extremely prolific.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie and Taylor 1865, volume 1, p.102. His pocket book records him as painting 150 sitters in 1758 alone.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Edgecumbe recommended the Duke of Devonshire and Duke of Grafton to sit for him, and other peers followed, including the Duke of Cumberland, third son of George II,&lt;ref name=penny22&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Ambitious Man|first=Nicholas|last=Penny|page=22|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; in whose portrait, according to [[Nicholas Penny]] "bulk is brilliantly converted into power".&lt;ref name=penny22/&gt; In 1760 Reynolds moved into a large house, with space to show his works and accommodate his assistants, on the west side of [[Leicester Square|Leicester Fields]] (now Leicester Square).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Ambitious Man|first=Nicholas|last=Penny|page=24|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Joshua Reynolds Self Portrait.jpg|thumbnail|upright|left|''Self-portrait'']]
Alongside ambitious full-length portraits, Reynolds painted large numbers of smaller works. In the late 1750s, at the height of the social season, he received five or six sitters a day, each for an hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Ambitious Man|first=Nicholas|last=Penny|pages=17–8|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1761 Reynolds could command a fee of 80 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] for a full-length portrait; in 1764 he was paid 100 guineas for a portrait of [[John Fane, 9th Earl of Westmorland|Lord Burghersh]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'' ''Sale Of The Vaile And Other Pictures'' 25 May 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

The clothing of Reynolds' sitters was usually painted by either one of his pupils,&lt;ref name=northcote/&gt; his studio assistant Giuseppe Marchi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Tate Gallery|title=Suzanna Beckford 1756|accessdate=3 July 2016|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/reynolds-suzanna-beckford-n05799/text-summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the specialist drapery painter [[Peter Toms (painter)|Peter Toms]].&lt;ref name=northcote&gt;{{cite book|title=The life of Sir Joshua Reynolds |volume=2|first=James |last=Northcote:| page=26|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Northcote, his pupil, wrote of this arrangement that "the imitation of particular stuffs is not the work of genius, but is to be acquired easily by practice, and this was what his pupils could do by care and time more than he himself chose to bestow; but his own slight and masterly work was still the best."&lt;ref name=northcote/&gt; Lay figures were used to model the clothes.&lt;ref name=penny22/&gt;
 
Reynolds often adapted the poses of his subjects from the works of earlier artists, a practice mocked by [[Nathaniel Hone the Elder|Nathaniel Hone]] in a painting called ''The Conjuror'' submitted to the Royal Academy exhibition of 1775, and now in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Ireland]]. It shows a figure representing, though not resembling, Reynolds, seated in front of a cascade of prints from which Reynolds had borrowed with varying degrees of subtlety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Reynolds and Hone|first=John|last=Newman|pages=344–54|title=Reynolds|publisher=Royal Academy of Arts|type=Exhibition catalogue|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not known principally for his landscapes, Reynolds did paint in this genre. He had an excellent vantage from his house, [[Wick House, Richmond Hill|Wick House]], on [[Richmond Hill, London|Richmond Hill]], and painted the view in about 1780.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richmond.gov.uk/local_history_richmond_hill.pdf|publisher=London Borough of Richmond|title=Local History RichmondHill|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204050838/http://www.richmond.gov.uk/local_history_richmond_hill.pdf|archivedate=4 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Age of Innocence - Reynolds.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Age of Innocence (painting)|The Age of Innocence]]'' {{circa|1788}}, Reynolds emphasized the natural grace of children in his paintings]]
Reynolds also was recognized for his portraits of children. He emphasized the innocence and natural grace of children when depicting them. His 1788 portrait, [[The Age of Innocence (1788 painting)|''Age of Innocence'']], is his best known character study of a child. The subject of the painting is not known, although conjecture includes Theophila Gwatkin, his great niece, and Lady Anne Spencer, the youngest daughter of the fourth Duke of Marlborough.

===The Club===
Reynolds worked long hours in his studio, rarely taking a holiday. He was gregarious and keenly intellectual, with many friends from London's intelligentsia, numbered amongst whom were [[Samuel Johnson|Dr Samuel Johnson]], [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Giuseppe Baretti]], [[Henry Thrale]], [[David Garrick]], and artist [[Angelica Kauffman]]. Johnson said in 1778: "Reynolds is too much under [Charles James] Fox and Burke at present. He is under the ''Fox star'' and the ''Irish constellation'' [meaning Burke]. He is always under some planet".&lt;ref&gt;James Boswell, ''Life of Johnson'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 923.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his popularity as a portrait painter, Reynolds enjoyed constant interaction with the wealthy and famous men and women of the day, and it was he who brought together the figures of [[The Club (dining club)|"The" Club]]. It was founded in 1764 and met in a suite of rooms on the first floor of the Turks Head at 9 Gerrard Street, now marked by a plaque. Original members included Burke, [[Bennet Langton]], [[Topham Beauclerk]], Goldsmith, Anthony Chamier, [[Thomas Hawkins (literary editor)|Thomas Hawkins]], and Nugent, to be joined by Garrick, [[James Boswell|Boswell]], and Sheridan. In ten years the membership had risen to 35. The Club met every Monday evening for supper and conversation and continued into the early hours of Tuesday morning. In later years, it met fortnightly during Parliamentary sessions. When in 1783 the landlord of the Turks Head died and the property was sold, The Club moved to Sackville Street.&lt;ref&gt;City of Westminster green plaques {{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Academy===

Reynolds was one of the earliest members of the [[Royal Society of Arts]], helped found the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain]], and in 1768 became the first president of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], a position he was to hold until his death. In 1769, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], only the second artist to be so honored.&lt;ref&gt;Wendorf, Richard, ''Sir Joshua Reynolds: The Painter in Society'' (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1998), p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''Discourses'', a series of lectures delivered at the Academy  between 1769 and 1790, are remembered for their sensitivity and perception. In one lecture he expressed the opinion that "invention, strictly speaking, is little more than a new combination of those images which have been previously gathered and deposited in the memory." William Jackson in his contemporary essays said of Reynolds ' there is much ingenuity and originality in all his academic discourses, replete with classical knowledge of his art, acute remarks on the works of others,  and general taste and discernment'.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, William ''The Four Ages including essays on various subjects'', Cadell &amp; Davies, London 1798&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds and the Royal Academy received a mixed reception. Critics included [[William Blake]] who published the vitriolic ''Annotations to Sir Joshua Reynolds' Discourses'' in 1808. [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[James Northcote (painter)|James Northcote]] were fervent acolytes: Turner requested he be laid to rest at Reynolds' side, and Northcote, who spent four years as Reynolds' pupil, wrote to his family "I know him thoroughly, and all his faults, I am sure, and yet almost worship him."

The Royal Academy of Art in London celebrated their 250th anniversary in 2018, since their opening in 1768. This became an impetus for galleries and museums across the UK to celebrate "the making, debating and exhibiting art at the Royal Academy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/ra250uk|title=RA250 UK|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waddedson manor was amongst the historic houses that supported Sir Joshua Reynolds's influence at the academy, acknowledging how:
[[File:Waddesdon 2468.jpg|thumb|Reynolds's 'Mrs Sheridan in the character of St Cecilia' was considered by the artist's nephew as a 'sight worth coming to Devonshire to see, I cannot suppose that there was ever a greater Beauty in the world, nor even Helen or Cleopatra could have exceeded her', 1775, [[Waddesdon Manor]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;[He] transformed British painting with portraits and subject pictures that engaged their audience's knowledge, imagination, memory and emotions... As an eloquent teacher and art theorist, he used his role at the head of the Royal Academy to raise the status of art and artists of Britain. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://waddesdon.org.uk/joshua-reynolds/|title=Joshua Reynolds digital trail, Waddesdon Manor|last=Carey|first=Juliet|date=30 March 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Lord Keppel''===
[[File:Augustus Keppel, Viscount Keppel by Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Augustus Keppel|Lord Keppel]]'' (1779)]]
In the [[Battle of Ushant (1778)|Battle of Ushant]] against the French in 1778, [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Lord Keppel]] commanded the [[English Channel|Channel]] Fleet and the outcome resulted in no clear winner; Keppel ordered the attack be renewed and was obeyed except by Sir [[Hugh Palliser]], who commanded the rear, and the French escaped bombardment. A dispute between Keppel and Palliser arose and Palliser brought charges of misconduct and neglect of duty against Keppel and the Admiralty decided to court-martial him. On 11 February 1779 Keppel was acquitted of all charges and became a national hero. One of Keppel's lawyers commissioned Sir [[Nathaniel Dance-Holland]] to paint a portrait of Keppel but Keppel redirected it to Reynolds. Reynolds alluded to Keppel's trial in the painting by painting his hand on his sword, reflecting the presiding officer's words at the court-martial: "In delivering to you your sword, I am to congratulate you on its being restored to you with so much honour".&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, pp. 350–353.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal Painter in Ordinary to the King===
On 10 August 1784 [[Allan Ramsay (artist)|Allan Ramsay]] died and the office of [[Principal Painter in Ordinary]] to [[King George III]] became vacant. [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] felt that he had a good chance of securing it, but Reynolds felt he deserved it and threatened to resign the presidency of the Royal Academy if he did not receive it. Reynolds noted in his pocket book: "Sept. 1, 2½, to attend at the Lord Chancellor's Office to be sworn in painter to the King".&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt; It did not make Reynolds happy, however, as he wrote to Boswell: "If I had known what a shabby miserable place it is, I would not have asked for it; besides as things have turned out I think a certain person is not worth speaking to, nor speaking of", presumably meaning the king.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, p. 427"&gt;McIntyre, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds wrote to [[Jonathan Shipley]], [[Bishop of St Asaph]], a few weeks later: "Your Lordship congratulation on my succeeding Mr. Ramsay I take very kindly, but it is a most miserable office, it is reduced from two hundred to thirty-eight pounds per annum, the Kings Rat catcher I believe is a better place, and I am to be paid only a fourth part of what I have from other people, so that the Portraits of their Majesties are not likely to be better done now, than they used to be, I should be ruined if I was to paint them myself".&lt;ref name="McIntyre, p. 427"/&gt;

===''Lord Heathfield''===
[[File:George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield - by Joshua Reynolds - Project Gutenberg eText 19009.jpg|thumb|''[[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lord Heathfield]]'' (1787)]]
In 1787 Reynolds painted the portrait of [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lord Heathfield]], who became a national hero for the successful defence of [[Gibraltar]] in the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Great Siege]] from 1779 to 1783 against the combined forces of France and Spain. Heathfield is depicted against a background of clouds and cannon smoke, wearing the uniform of the 15th Light Dragoons and clasping the key of the Rock, its chain wrapped twice around his right hand.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, p. 472.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Constable]] said in the 1830s that it was "almost a history of the defence of Gibraltar".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; Desmond Shawe-Taylor has claimed that the portrait may have a religious meaning, Heathfield holding the key similar to St. Peter (Jesus' "rock") possessing the keys to Heaven, Heathfield "the rock upon which Britannia builds her military interests".&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Desmond Shawe-Taylor, ''The Georgians: Eighteenth-Century Portraiture and Society'' (London: Barrie &amp; Jenkins, 1990), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In 1789, Reynolds lost the sight of his left eye, which forced him into retirement. In 1791 [[James Boswell]] dedicated his ''[[Life of Samuel Johnson]]'' to Reynolds. Reynolds  agreed with Burke's ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' and, writing in early 1791, expressed his belief that the ''ancien régime'' of France had fallen due to spending too much time tending, as he puts it; &lt;blockquote&gt;to the splendor of the foliage, to the neglect of the stirring the earth about the roots. They cultivated only those arts which could add splendor to the nation, to the neglect of those which supported it – They neglected Trade &amp; substantial Manufacture...but does it follow that a total revolution is necessary that because we have given ourselves up too much to the ornaments of life, we will now have none at all.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; When attending a dinner at Holland House, Fox's niece Caroline was sat next to Reynolds and "burst out into glorification of the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] &amp;ndash; and was grievously chilled and checked by her neighbour's cautious and unsympathetic tone".&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June 1791 at a dinner at the Freemasons' Tavern to mark the king's birthday, Reynolds drank to the toasts "GOD ''save the'' KING!" and "May our glorious Constitution under which the arts flourish, be immortal!", in what was reported by the ''Public Advertiser'' as "a fervour truly patriotick". Reynolds "filled the chair with a most convivial glee".&lt;ref name="McIntyre, p. 523"&gt;McIntyre, p. 523.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to town from Burke's house in [[Beaconsfield]] and [[Edmond Malone]] wrote that "we left his carriage at the Inn at Hayes, and walked five miles on the road, in a warm day, without his complaining of any fatigue".&lt;ref name="McIntyre, p. 523"/&gt;

Later that month Reynolds suffered from a swelling over his left eye and had to be purged by a surgeon. In October he was too ill to take the president's chair and in November Fanny Burney recorded that &lt;blockquote&gt;I had long languished to see that kindly zealous friend, but his ill health had intimidated me from making the attempt": "He had a bandage over one eye, and the other shaded with a green half-bonnet. He seemed serious even to sadness, though extremely kind. 'I am very glad,' he said, in a meek voice and dejected accent, 'to see you again, and I wish I could see you better! but I have only one eye now, and hardly that.' I was really quite touched.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, pp. 523–524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; On 5 November Reynolds, fearing he might not have an opportunity to write a will, wrote a memorandum intended to be his last will and testament, with [[Edmund Burke]], [[Edmond Malone]], and [[Philip Metcalfe]] named as executors. On 10 November Reynolds wrote to Benjamin West to resign the presidency, but the General Assembly agreed he should be re-elected, with Sir [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] and West to deputise for him.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 524–525"&gt;McIntyre, pp. 524–525.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doctors [[Richard Warren]] and Sir [[George Baker, 1st Baronet|George Baker]] believed Reynolds' illness to be psychological and they bled his neck "with a view of drawing the humour from his eyes" but the effect, in the view of his niece, was that it seemed "as if the 'principle of life' were gone" from Reynolds. On New Year's Day 1792 Reynolds became "seized with sickness" and from that point could not keep down food.&lt;ref name="McIntyre, pp. 524–525"/&gt;
Reynolds died on 23 February 1792 at his house in [[Leicester Fields]] in London between eight and nine in the evening.

Burke was present on the night Reynolds died, and was moved within hours to write a eulogy of Reynolds starting with the following sentiments: "Sir Joshua Reynolds was on very many accounts one of the most memorable men of his Time. He was the first Englishman who added the praise of the elegant Arts to the other Glories of his Country. In Taste, in grace, in facility, in happy invention, and in the richness and Harmony of colouring, he was equal to the great masters of the renowned Ages." Burke's tribute was well received and one journalist called it "the eulogium of [[Apelles]] pronounced by [[Pericles]]".&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, p. 528.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reynolds was buried at [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. In 1903, [[Statue of Joshua Reynolds|a statue]], by [[Alfred Drury]], was erected in his honour in Annenberg Courtyard of [[Burlington House]], home of the Royal Academy.&lt;ref name="LR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/burlington-house-courtyard-joshua-reynolds|title=Burlington House courtyard – Joshua Reynolds|publisher=London Remembers|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the statue are fountains and lights, installed in 2000, arranged in the pattern of a star chart at midnight on the night of Reynolds' birth. The planets are marked by granite discs, and the Moon by a water recess. &lt;ref name="AU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://burlingtonhouse.org/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=Burlington House|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal characteristics==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Gilbert Stuart Sir Joshua Reynolds.jpg|thumb|right|''Joshua Reynolds'' painted by American artist [[Gilbert Stuart]], oil on canvas, 1784]]

In appearance Reynolds was not striking. Slight, he was about 5'6" with dark brown curls, a florid complexion and features that [[James Boswell]] thought were "rather too largely and strongly limned." He had a broad face and a cleft chin, and the bridge of his nose was slightly dented; his skin was scarred by smallpox and his upper lip disfigured as a result of falling from a horse as a young man. [[Edmond Malone]] asserted that "his appearance at first sight impressed the spectator with the idea of a well-born and well-bred English gentleman."

In his mature years he suffered from deafness, as recorded by [[Fanny Burney]], although this did not impede his lively social life (he used an ear trumpet).&lt;ref&gt;Burney, F. ''The Diary of Fanny Burney'', Dent (Everyman edition), London, 1971, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned for his placidity, Reynolds often claimed that he "hated nobody". Never quite losing his Devonshire accent, he was not only an amiable and original conversationalist, but a friendly and generous host, so that [[Fanny Burney]] recorded in her diary that he had "a suavity of disposition that set everybody at their ease in his society", and [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] believed "of all the polite men of that age, Joshua Reynolds was the finest gentleman." Dr. Johnson commented on the "inoffensiveness" of his nature; [[Edmund Burke]] noted his "strong turn for humor". Thomas Bernard, who later became [[List of Anglican Bishops of Killaloe|Bishop of Killaloe]], wrote in his closing verses on Reynolds stating:

[[File:Miniature Portrait of Sir Joshua Reynolds by William Grimaldi.jpg|thumb|left|Enamel Miniature Portrait of ''Sir Joshua Reynolds'' by William Grimaldi. Dated 1811]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Thou say'st not only skill is gained
But genius too may be attained
By studious imitation;
Thy temper mild, thy genius fine
I'll copy till I make them mine
By constant application.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some, such as [[Hester Lynch Piozzi]], construed Reynolds' equable calm as cool and unfeeling.

It is to this lukewarm temperament that [[Frederick W. Hilles]], Bodman Professor of English Literature at [[Yale University|Yale]] attributes Reynolds' never having married. In the editorial notes of his compendium ''Portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds'', Hilles theorizes that "as a corollary one might say that he [Reynolds] was somewhat lacking in a capacity for love", and cites Boswell's notary papers: "He said the reason he would never marry was that every woman whom he liked had grown indifferent to him, and he had been &lt;u&gt;glad&lt;/u&gt; he did not marry her." Reynolds' own sister, Frances, who lived with him as housekeeper, took her own negative opinion further still, thinking him "a gloomy tyrant". The presence of family compensated Reynolds for the absence of a wife; he wrote on one occasion to his friend [[Bennet Langton]], that both his sister and niece were away from home "so that I am quite a bachelor". 

Biographer [[Ian McIntyre]] discusses the possibility of Reynolds having enjoyed sexual rendezvous with certain clients, such as Nelly O'Brien (or "My Lady O'Brien", as he playfully dubbed her) and [[Kitty Fisher]], who visited his house for more sittings than were strictly necessary. [[Dan Cruickshank]] in his book ''London's Sinful Secret'' summarized Reynolds as having visited and re-visited various reputed red light districts in London after his return from Italy as a possible contributor to his medical condition and appearance due to commonly contracted disease in those areas of London.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Cruickshank]], ''London's Sinful Secret'', p.92. St. Martin's Press, New York (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1867">A '''''kommos''''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] κομμός, ''kommós'', literally "striking", especially "beating of the head and breast in [[mourning]]"&lt;ref name=LSJ&gt;{{LSJ|kommo/s1|κομμός|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Lyric poetry|lyrical song]] of [[Lament|lamentation]] in an [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[tragedy]] that the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] and a [[Drama|dramatic]] [[Character (arts)|character]] sing together.&lt;ref name="r57"&gt;Rehm (1992, 57).&lt;/ref&gt; A kommos occurs "when the tension of the play rises to a [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of grief or horror or joy".&lt;ref&gt;Baldry (1971, 64).&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the final section (lines 908-1077) of [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Persians]]'' (472 BCE) in which [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] laments the defeat of his [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] army, the final appearance of [[Antigone]] in [[Sophocles]]' ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' (c.442 BCE), the interaction between the chorus and [[Oedipus]] when he returns having blinded himself in Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' (c.429 BCE), and the exchange between [[Orestes]], [[Electra]] and the chorus immediately after [[Clytemnestra]]'s murder in [[Euripides]]' ''[[Electra (Euripides)|Electra]]'' (c.410 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 57) and Baldry (1971, 64).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assassinations''' have formed a major plot element in various works of fiction. This article provides a list of fictional stories in which assassination features as an important plot element.  Passing mentions are omitted.
 
Assassination can be regarded as the murder of a ''prominent'' person for a motive which is broadly public and political rather than merely personal or financial.&lt;ref&gt;
Murders within families are often termed assassinations if the family members are very prominent. This would be true of Roman Empire poisonings, or the 2001 [[Nepalese royal massacre|slaughter of the royal family in Nepal]]. The murder of the well-known actor [[Phil Hartman]] by his wife in 1998 does not qualify.
&lt;br /&gt;
Is the 1978 murder of actor [[Bob Crane]] assassination? No. Is the 1987 murder of singer [[Peter Tosh]] by robbers assassination? If the motive is extortion, no. If an author writes a novel proposing a broad conspiracy, then yes. Is the 1948 death of actor [[Solomon Mikhoels]] assassination? Yes. It was orchestrated by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]].
&lt;br /&gt;
King [[Alex I of England|Charles I]]? No. Executed publicly, after a trial. Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]? Yes. Executed secretly, with his children, without a trial.
&lt;br /&gt;
There will always be a problem with a precise definition and applying that definition to specific cases.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Assassinations in fiction have attracted scholarly attention.  In ''Assassinations and Murder in Modern Italy: Transformations in Society and Culture'', as well as analyzing Italian assassinations in their historical and cultural contexts, Stephen Gundle and Lucia Rinaldi explore the films, plays, other works of fiction, and art that the act of assassination has inspired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palgrave-usa.com/catalog/product.aspx?isbn=1403983917 ''Assassinations and Murder in Modern Italy'']: ''Transformations in Society and Culture'', edited by Stephen Gundle and Lucia Rinaldi (Palgrave Macmillan, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Cullather]] has discussed "The Movie Version" of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cullather, "History, Conspiracy, and the Kennedy Assassination", ''Retrieving the American Past'', ed. Marc Horger (New York: Pearson Custom Publishing, 2005), pp. 301–30&lt;/ref&gt;

This list prefers to highlight less familiar cultural artifacts, while trying not to itemize every [[Ian Fleming]] or [[Agatha Christie]] title, or every [[Mafia]] film. The historical–historically based or historically inspired–takes precedence over the purely fictional and sensational.

Introductory notes:

This section does not indicate the country of origin for a film which is in English. (Far too many countries produce films in English, either by themselves, or in complex co-production arrangements which are '''irrelevant''' to the subject matter of this article.)

When the nationality of a film is indicated, that is primarily about the '''language''' of the film. In cases where a country has multiple official languages, or languages in common use, then the film's language is noted in parentheses. French Canadian films represent an exception (since the editor of this section is a Canadian). (Presumably, at some point, there could be British (Welsh) or South African (Afrikaans) films listed here, but in both of these cases, the nationality is not indicated now.)

The other reason to note a film's nationality is to provide a context for the film's description. So a "President" in a Polish film description implies a Polish President. In the general English-speaking context, a "President" is assumed to be American, rather than Irish or South African and so forth, but that is usually clarified here by using "US President" explicitly.

This section assumes an intelligent readership that does not require links to define major world cities (no Moscow or New Delhi, much less [[Paris, France]]), or the states and provinces of the USA, Canada, and Australia. Indian states, alas, are not so familiar to anglophones outside the subcontinent, so this section will use [[Himachal Pradesh]]. British and Irish counties, in spite of their antiquity in many cases, are also not immediately familiar to many, so this section will use [[Co. Durham]] and [[Co. Donegal]] when needed.

If there is a link to a "novel", then it is to an actual novel, and not merely the definition of the word "novel". Links in this section should always be consequential.
--&gt;
The list is organized chronologically by year of release, rather than year of production.&lt;br /&gt;
Within each year, films based on genuine historical events are listed first, followed by any purely fictional entries.
&lt;!--
  -- Previously, this list distinguished real from imaginary by having links to the years
  -- of the actual historical events.
  -- Links to years have now generally been suppressed in English Wikipedia.

Many books have been produced about iconic photographs and giving suggested examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hariman|first1=Robert|last2=Lucaites|first2=John Louis|title=No caption needed : iconic photographs, public culture, and liberal democracy|date=2007|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226316062}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomson|first1=Ruth|title=Photos Framed A Fresh Look at the World's Most Memorable Photographs.|date=2014|publisher=Candlewick Pr|isbn=9780763671549}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morelli|first1=Gianni|last2=Mottadelli|first2=Roberto|title=100 Photographs That Changed the World|date=2017|publisher=White Star|isbn=9788854410800}}&lt;/ref&gt; This '''list of iconic photographs''' provides an index to articles where the major topic is an iconic photograph of events or people. The requirement is that the particular photographs themselves are sufficiently famous to warrant an article – the fame of the person or event is not in itself enough. Sometimes the articles are about the person rather than the photograph taken of them but this is normally where they would probably not have become notable except for the image. Some of the photographs are of staged situations that did not actually take place at all.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Only articles that display the actual photograph are considered (those without an image have not been included in this index) but, because they are often not available under a free licence, these images are linked to here but not displayed.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27803">This is a list of [[nonfiction]] works that have been made into [[feature film]]s. The title of the work is followed by the work's author, the title of the film, and the year of the film. If a film has an alternate title based on geographical distribution, the title listed will be that of the widest distribution area.

The list does not include [[documentary film]]s that are based on real events and people which are not based chiefly on a written work. For other documentary film categories, see [[:Category:Documentaries|documentaries]].

'''Lord Buckethead''' is a British [[political satire|satirical political candidate]]. A candidate of that name has stood in three [[List of United Kingdom general elections|United Kingdom general elections]] against three different [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party leaders]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers]]. Representing the Gremloids, a [[List of frivolous political parties|frivolous political party]], he ran against [[Margaret Thatcher]] for parliament in [[Finchley (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections in the 1980s|Finchley]] in 1987, against [[John Major]] in [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections in the 1990s|Huntingdon]] in 1992, and against [[Theresa May]] in [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections in the 2010s|Maidenhead]] in 2017 where he polled 0.4% of the vote. 

Outside of political contexts, Lord Buckethead has appeared at [[Glastonbury Festival]], introducing the band [[Sleaford Mods]] in 2017,&lt;ref name="Mods"/&gt; and has additionally released a [[Christmas music|Christmas song]] titled "A Bucketful of Happiness".&lt;ref name="Bucketful"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/world-news/and-finally/lord-buckethead-released-a-music-video-for-christmas-and-its-a-mustwatch-36425363.html|title=Lord Buckethead released a music video for Christmas and it’s a must-watch - Independent.ie|author=|date=|website=independent.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Lord Buckethead claims to be an [[Intergalactic travel|intergalactic]] space lord. His name and costume are derived from the 1984 cult sci-fi comedy [[Hyperspace (film)|''Hyperspace'']] (also known as ''Gremloids'', the name of Lord Buckethead's party) by writer and director [[Todd Durham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/real-lord-buckethead-cult-sci-fi-film-inspired-theresa-mays/|title=The real Lord Buckethead: the cult sci-fi film that inspired Theresa May's election rival|work=The Telegraph|access-date=10 June 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate going by the name of Lord Buckethead has stood for parliament in three [[List of United Kingdom general elections|United Kingdom general elections]], but on every occasion his face was obscured as he was wearing a bucket-like mask on his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Who is Lord Buckethead, the man who stood against Theresa May? – BBC Newsbeat|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/40217791/who-is-lord-buckethead-the-man-who-stood-against-theresa-may|accessdate=9 June 2017|publisher=BBC Newsbeat|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Buckethead's participation in parliamentary elections has been considered typical of a British tradition for "unorthodox candidates" in politics, having been compared to the activities of the [[Official Monster Raving Loony Party]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/09/lord-buckethead-elmo-and-mr-fish-finger-a-very-british-election|title=Lord Buckethead, Elmo and Mr Fishfinger: a very British election|last=Malkin|first=Bonnie|date=9 June 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=10 June 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, VIPCO, an indie home video label in the UK, was experiencing some problems. The owner of VIPCO, Mike Lee was running less controversial labels in 1987, so Mike decided to enter the election to get some publicity for one of the films he had at his company. Mike decided to dress up as Lord Buckethead, the villain of ''Gremloids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reprobatemagazine.uk/2017/06/14/article-lord-buckethead-the-whole-story/|title=Article: Lord Buckethead – The Whole Story|date=14 June 2017|work=The Reprobate|access-date=26 February 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, VIPCO, which had been revived, had Gremloids on its release slate. Mike Lee decided to join the election as Lord Buckethead again.  

The 2017 incarnation of Lord Buckethead was named as Jonathan David Harvey in the returning officer's declaration for the Maidenhead constituency in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 United Kingdom general election]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/elections/2017/05/lord-buckethead-vs-theresa-may-meet-uks-weirdest-political-parties|title=Lord Buckethead vs Theresa May – meet the UK's weirdest political parties|website=New Statesman|language=en|access-date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/13/lord-buckethead-to-stand-against-theresa-may-in-general-election-6635416/|title='Lord Buckethead' to stand against Theresa May in General Election|last=Metro.co.uk|first=Georgia Diebelius for|date=13 May 2017|website=Metro|access-date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/621214/election-results-2017-theresa-may-lord-buckethead-dab-celebration-maidenhead-video|title=Lord Buckethead is election hero after dabbing on stage next to Theresa May|date=10 June 2017|work=Daily Star|location=United Kingdom|access-date=10 June 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked by [[CBC Radio]] interviewer [[Carol Off]] if he was the same individual running as Lord Buckethead in each election or "are you like [[Doctor Who]], do you regenerate for each election?", he replied: "I am Buckethead. We are Buckethead. We are Legion. Does that answer your question?"&lt;ref name=platform/&gt;

In 1992, he (again Mike Lee) stood in [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] against [[John Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/media/1738/1950-1992.pdf|title=Huntingdonshire Vote Counts 1950–92|website=Official Huntingdonshire.Gov.UK|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received 107 votes (0.1%) in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|general election]].&lt;ref name="Engel2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matthew Engel|title=Engel's England: Thirty-nine counties, one capital and one man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfJYBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT150|date=23 October 2014|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=978-1-84765-928-6|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, Lord Buckethead (Jonathan David Harvey) campaigned for election in [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]] against Prime Minister [[Theresa May]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/gallery/general-election-2017/115987/pictures-lord-buckethead-campaigns-for-election-in-maidenhead.html|title=PICTURES: Lord Buckethead campaigns for election in Maidenhead|access-date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/09/532224198/a-man-with-a-bucket-on-his-head-ran-to-unseat-theresa-may-why-well|title=A Man with a Bucket on His Head Ran To Unseat Theresa May.

*[[Nuclear weapons]]: "A firm public commitment to build the 100-billion-pound renewal of Britain's [[Trident nuclear programme|Trident weapons system]], followed by an equally firm commitment, privately, not to build it.

*Instead of Theresa May's commitment to bring back&lt;ref name=platform/&gt; [[Premiership of Theresa May#Grammar schools|grammar schools]], Buckethead would build "gamma" schools founded on three principles: "One, better funding for teachers, to attract bright graduates. Two, increased facilities for children, especially playing fields.

'''''Mary Shelley's Frankenhole''''' is an American [[Adult animation|adult]] [[stop-motion]] animated television series created by [[Dino Stamatopoulos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brigid Alverson|title=Interview: 'Mary Shelley's Frankenhole' Creator Dino Stamatopoulos|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2011/10/28/interview-mary-shelleys-frankenhole-creator-dino-stamatopoulos/|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=[[MTV Geek!]]|date=October 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ddd&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott Thill|title=Exclusive Clips: Horror Satire Reanimates Mary Shelley's Frankenhole|url=https://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/01/mary-shelleys-frankenhole/|accessdate=1 May 2012|newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|date=January 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series premiered on June 27, 2010 on [[Cartoon Network|Cartoon Network's]] late night programming block [[Adult Swim]]. It ended on March 25, 2012, with a total of 20 episodes, over the course of 2 seasons.

==Premise==
[[Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Victor Frankenstein]] has completely mastered immortality and has now also created an infinite number of [[Einstein–Rosen Bridge]]s (wormholes) or "Frankenholes" between Somewhere in Eastern [[Europe]] (which is teeming with [[monster]]s and [[supernatural]] forces) and every time period from the past and the future. This allows historical figures and celebrities seeking the doctor's services to find him. Although many classic horror monsters are present, the series' main focus is Dr. Frankenstein and his family. Creator Dino Stamatopoulos says "regular human beings are the monsters."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adultswim.com/shows/mary-shelleys-frankenhole/extras/interview/frankenhole-interview-blast-dino-stamatopoulos.html Interview with Dino Stamatopoulos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Dr. Frankenstein himself, other characters from ''[[Frankenstein]]'' appear.

==Characters==
* '''Dr. [[Victor Frankenstein]]''' (voiced by [[Jeff B. Davis]]) – An immortal genius [[mad scientist]]. He "doesn't like anyone," wears a lab coat and has red hair. He is a sadomasochist (auto eroticism such as burning his crotch, shooting himself below the waist, etc.) and is opposed to the idea of regular sex, especially with his wife, who uses his fetish to her advantage by bribing him with genital mutilation. He had a troubled relationship with his father since his dying wish was to not be brought back to life. He begins work at midnight for "creditability." Since he never gave the immortality serum to his sons, they continue to age while Victor and Elizabeth stay youthful.
* '''[[Doctor Septimus Pretorius|Professor Sanguinaire Polidori]]''' (voiced by [[Scott Adsit]]) – The immortal assistant and partner of Victor. He is tall, has white hair and wears a lab coat. He sometimes acts as a conscience for Frankenstein, but is often quiet (playing into his supporting cast role). Often a voice of reason, "Polly Dolly" (as Frankenstein calls him) has a soft spot for the sinister. He insists they revive Frankenstein's father so they can beat him up, drinks poison, and often has a disdainful tone in his voice. Polidori has been Frankenstein's assistant for quite some time; he was already immortal when Frankenstein and Elizabeth were first married (in fact, Polidori was the one who married them). When bringing patients into Frankenstein's lab, it is said that he gives Frankenstein creepy introductions. He is based on [[Doctor Septimus Pretorius]] from ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]''. His name is based upon author [[John Polidori]], a friend of [[Mary Shelley]].
* '''[[Elizabeth Lavenza|Elizabeth Frankenstein]]''' (voiced by [[Britta Phillips]]) – Victor's immortal wife. She tries to act motherly but is sexually starved and is having an affair with Count Dracula, although she does this to try to make Victor jealous. She is often at odds with her husband and lover, often expressing displeasure over the little time Victor devotes to the family due to working from midnight forward. Victor secretly gave Elizabeth the immortality serum without her knowing about it when she married Victor's childhood friend Henry Clerval, and never asked to be immortal. When she did finally give into his obsessive demands to marry her, he instantly became bored. This is the reason for their faulted relationship.
* '''[[Count Dracula]]''' (voiced by Chris Shearer) – Victor's rival who is having an affair with Elizabeth, with hopes of turning her into a [[vampire]]. He often argues with Victor, usually belittling Elizabeth in the process. He is known to be politically correct during his arguments with Frankenstein. Dracula usually exits a scene turning into a bat.
* '''[[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's "Creature"]]''' (voiced by [[Scott Adsit]]) – Victor's cynical creation and servant, who prefers to be called Creation instead of Monster. He is an alcoholic according to Victor, expressing his life and future are death, and has a big fear of fire. He at one point mentions that Frankenstein was fearful of his creation, but now has come to be annoyed by the monster.  His left leg is Jewish, and can speak when detached. He's also very much infatuated with "The Bride", who was made for him. However, she has a true disdain for him, going so far as to have her hair replaced with fire to keep him away.
* '''[[Igor (character)|Igor]]''' (voiced by Tigger Stamatopoulos) – Victor's hunch-backed assistant with a girlish, childish voice who usually briefly supplies tools during Victor's projects. Igor usually responds to his orders with "You got it".
* '''Blanket Jackson''' (voiced by Mark Rivers) – [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson's]] adult son, who recently bought ownership of the tavern where all the local monsters hang out.
* '''Heinrich Frankenstain and Gustav Frankenstain''' (voiced by Mark Rivers and Scott Adsit) – The elderly, mortal sons of Victor and Elizabeth. Victor doesn't care much about them but despite this, Elizabeth tries to be motherly. In some ways, she cares more about them than Victor does. When Heinrich has been shown in his youth, he was full of joy. In his youth, it was the only time even Victor and Polidori found him adorable. But most likely over the years, both quickly grew bored of the children. Though Heinrich remains a happy child at heart, Gustav has become bitter about his mortality and hates his parents for not making him immortal, often cursing at them in German under his breath. The Grim Reaper doesn't take their lives because he wants to punish Victor and Elizabeth by letting them live (the two may have gained immortality because of Death's bitter qualities). They are named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus, a scientist.
* '''[[Lawrence Talbot|Stewart Lawrence]]''' (voiced by [[Jay Johnston]]) – A suicidal man with the curse of the [[Werewolf]] as the result of a [[time paradox]] of ironically biting himself while in his transformed state. He can only be killed at the hands of someone who loves him. He's an annoyance to almost everyone as he's constantly complaining about his curse.
* '''Joe Yunger''' (voiced by [[Joe Unger]]) – A local [[vampire hunter]] who often hangs out at the tavern. Because of their mutual hatred of vampires, he and Victor have become good friends.
* '''The Mummy''' (voiced by [[Dino Stamatopoulos]]) – A wannabe comedian mummy who constantly annoys everyone with his bad jokes and mummy puns.
* '''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''' (voiced by [[Dan Harmon]]) – The local pharmacist and Victor's rival mad-scientist.
* '''[[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas K. Gandhi]]''' (voiced by Mark Rivers) – One of the local vampires.
* '''[[Mother Teresa]]''' (voiced by Dino Stamatopoulos) – The Frankensteins' servant.
* '''Vampire Trio''' - A group of vampires that usually show up together.  
** '''Nosferatu''' – A silent vampire who is often seen hanging out at the local tavern. He speaks in silent film title cards. He is a parody of [[Count Orlok]] from 1922's Nosferatu, and pastiche versions of Sesame Street's [[Count von Count]] and [[General Mills monster-themed breakfast cereals|Count Chocula]] of breakfast cereal fame.
* '''[[Death (personification)|Death]]''' (Dino Stamatopoulos) – The physical manifestation of Death. He goes out of his way to try and bother the immortal Dr. Frankenstein. Death takes joy out of his powers and duty, but is seen as a goof ball by anyone not subject to his power. He really just wants Dr. Frankenstein's respect. His design is inspired by Death as it appears in ''[[The Masque of the Red Death]]''.

'''Migrantas''' are an [[artist collective]] based in [[Berlin]], Germany that formed in 2004.&lt;ref name="date-formed" /&gt; The collective focuses on themes such as migration, identity and intercultural communication and designs pictograms together with migrants which are then placed in public spaces in order to give voice to [[Immigration|migrants]] living in [[Germany]].

The collective is made up of migrants and is organised non-hierarchically. Since 2004, the project has been organising exhibitions in various European cities. In 2011, the [[collective]] was awarded the German award for integration and tolerance by the [[German chancellor]], [[Angela Merkel]] on behalf of the Initiative Hauptstadt Berlin.&lt;ref name="Hauptstadt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Graffiti fördern Integration" /&gt;

Migrantas views [[pictograms]] as universally understandable images and a global language.&lt;ref name="global" /&gt; Pictograms designed by Migrantas are similar to those found all over in the world in public spaces where they are normally used in place of written language in advertising and street signs.&lt;ref name="signs" /&gt; The difference between Migrantas' pictograms is that they are used to highlight the individual, cultural, socio-economic and political aspects of migration.&lt;ref name="goethe" /&gt;

The pictograms are developed during [[workshops]] together with migrant groups and associations. The idea is then to make visible the feelings and everyday experiences of migrants, which migrantas argue otherwise receive very little publicity. The collective mostly works with women and encourages workshop participants to express their everyday experiences, feelings and views of life as a migrant living in a foreign culture.&lt;ref name="auswaertigesamt" /&gt; The sketches produced in these workshops are then developed into pictograms by the collective members themselves.

Finally, the pictograms are placed in public spaces during 'urban actions'&lt;ref name="urban" /&gt; which until now have included using posters, billboards, and advertising on public transport. At the same time, migrantas also organises exhibitions of its work and the sketches produced during its workshops. Migrantas argues that this gives the migrants themselves the opportunity to receive public recognition for their own work. At the same time, this provides individuals who have very little access to the media the opportunity to publicise their own experiences of migration and immigration.&lt;ref name="wiedemann" /&gt;

The ''''' Mural Paintings from the Herrera Chapel'''''  is group of mural painting by [[Annibale Carracci]] and collaborators, conserved between the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]]&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and de [[Museo del Prado]].

== History ==
In 1602, the Spanish nobleman [[Juan Enriquez de Herrera]] dedicated a chapel in the church of Santiago, the Spanish Franciscan of Rome to [[Diego de Alcala]]. The mural decoration, with scenes from the saint's life, was done by the Bolognese painter [[Annibale Carracci]]. In 1604 began designing the master of all the preparatory cartoons, but he came ill while personally directing the work 'in situ'. So, the work was finished by his collaborators, who included [[Giovanni Lanfranco]] [[Sisto Badalocchio]] and [[Francesco Albani]]. In the mid-nineteenth century the frescoes were uprooted and transferred to canvas and are now distributed between [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya|MNAC]] and [[Museo del Prado]].

== Description ==
The group consists of 16 items, 9 of which are kept at the MNAC&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=fce3ac54f2987b63332300a72fa27ff58fbe6216fdddd677b896b59423ea837a?inventoryNumber=005674-CJT&amp;lang=en  The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the other 7 at the Museo del Prado in Madrid. From the former church of [[San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/carracci-anibal/ Museo del Prado]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|left|100px|Idries Shah]]
Based on university lectures at the New School for Social Research, New York, and the University of California, San Francisco, ''Neglected Aspects of Sufi Study'' deals with many of the problems of Sufic methods of study and those which militate against its effective progress in the modern world; notably the unrecognised assumptions which we make about ourselves and about learning and its process.

==Reception==

''Neglected Aspects of Sufi Study'' was favourably received, the Books and Bookmen review commenting that; “It elaborates points found difficult in our culture because of sets of mind.”&lt;ref&gt;Books and Bookmen&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Asian Affairs]] wrote that it “contains serious warnings about the dangers of facile cult-formation”,&lt;ref&gt;Asian Affairs, February 1979&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Psychology Today]] review described the book as “an extraordinarily effective learning tool.”&lt;ref&gt;Psychology Today, June 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ford manual 1919.djvu|thumb|262x262px]]

An '''owner's manual''' (also called an '''instruction manual''' or a '''user guide''') is an instructional [[book]] or [[book]]let that is supplied with almost all technologically advanced consumer products such as [[vehicles]], [[home appliances]] and [[computer peripheral]]s.
Information contained in the owner's manual typically includes:
* [[Safety]] instructions; for [[Legal liability|liability]] reasons these can be extensive, often including warnings against performing operations that are ill-advised for product longevity or overall user safety reasons.
* Assembly instructions; for products that arrive in pieces for easier shipping.
* Installation instructions; for products that need to be installed in a home or workplace.
* Setup instructions; for devices that keep track of time or which maintain user accessible state.
* Instructions for normal or intended operations.
* [[Computer programming|Programming]] instructions; for [[microprocessor]] controlled products such as [[VCR]]s, [[programmable calculator]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s.
* [[Preventive maintenance|Maintenance]] instructions.
* [[Troubleshooting]] instructions; for when the product does not work as expected.
* Service locations; for when the product requires [[repair]] by a factory authorized [[technician]].
* [[Regulation|Regulatory code]] compliance information; for example with respect to safety or [[electromagnetic interference]].
* Product [[technical specifications]].
* [[Warranty]] information; sometimes provided as a separate sheet.

Until the last decade or two of the twentieth century it was common for an owner's manual to include detailed [[repair]] information, such as a [[circuit diagram]]; however as products became more complex this information was gradually relegated to specialized [[service manual]]s, or dispensed with entirely, as devices became too inexpensive to be economically repaired.

Owner's manuals for simpler devices are often [[multilingual]] so that the same boxed product can be sold in many different markets. Sometimes the same manual is shipped with a range of related products so the manual will contain a number of sections that apply only to some particular model in the product range.

With the increasing complexity of modern devices, many owner's manuals have become so large that a separate [[quickstart guide]] is provided. Some owner's manuals for computer equipment are supplied on [[CD-ROM]] to cut down on manufacturing costs, since the owner is assumed to have a computer able to read the CD-ROM. Another trend is to supply instructional video material with the product, such as a [[videotape]] or [[DVD]], along with the owner's manual.

Many businesses offer [[PDF]] copies of manuals that can be accessed or downloaded free of charge from their websites.

== Installation manual ==
An installation manual or installation guide is a [[Technical communication|technical communication]] [[Document|document]] intended to instruct people how to install a particular product. An installation manual is usually written by a [[Technical writer|technical writer]] or other technical staff. 

Installation is the act of putting something in place so that it is ready for use.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of “installation” from the Cambridge Academic Content Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; An installation manual most commonly describes the safe and correct installation of a product. The term product here relates to any consumer, non-consumer, hardware, software, electrical, electronic or mechanical product that requires installation. The installation of a computer program is also known as the [[Installation (computer programs)|setup]].
[[Image:Installatiehandleiding rollend hekwerk installatie.jpg|thumb|link=https://www.manualise.com/en/installation-manual/|250px|A sample of an installation manual]]
In case of an installation manual, the installation instruction is a separate document that focuses solely on the person(s) that will perform the installation. However, the installation instruction can also be an integrated part of the overall owner's manual.

The size, structure and content of an installation manual depend heavily on the nature of the product and the needs and capabilities of the intended target group. Furthermore, various standards and directives are available that provide guidance and requirements for the design of instructions.

The international standard IEC 82079&lt;ref&gt;IEC 82079-1:2012, p. 31, 5 Content of instructions for use&lt;/ref&gt; prescribes the required installation topics for an installation instruction. Among these topics, are procedures, diagrams and conditions for installation activities, such as unpacking, mounting and connecting.

For machines the European Machinery Directive prescribes that an instruction manual must contain assembly, installation and connecting instructions, including drawings, diagrams and the means of attachment and the designation of the chassis or installation on which the machinery is to be mounted.&lt;ref&gt;Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC , p. 25-26, 1.7.4.2 Contents of the instructions.&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Car owner's manuals ==
All new cars come with an owner's manual from the manufacturer. Most owners leave them in the [[glove compartment]] for easy reference. This can make their frequent absence in [[rental car]]s frustrating because it violates the driver's [[user expectations]], as well as makes it difficult to use controls that aren't understood, which is not good because understanding control operation of an unfamiliar car is one of the first steps recommended in [[defensive driving]]. Owner's manuals usually cover three main areas: a description of the location and operation of all controls; a schedule and descriptions of maintenance required, both by the owner and by a mechanic; and specifications such as oil and fuel capacity and part numbers of light bulbs used. Current car owner's manuals have become much bigger in part due to many safety warnings most likely designed to avoid [[product liability]] lawsuits, as well as from ever more complicated audio and navigational systems, which often have their own manual.

If owners lose their car manual, they can either order a replacement from a dealer, pick up a used one secondhand, or download a PDF version of the manual online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.edmunds.com/how-to/how-to-find-your-car-owners-manual-online.html |title = How to Find Your Car Owner's Manual Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 the next generation of digitized car manuals came online, which use [[Watson_(computer)|IBM Watson]] Artificial Intelligence to understand and answer questions in natural driver language&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/2017/11/end-of-the-car-manual/&lt;/ref&gt;. "Ask Mercedes" was the first in a wave of these vehicle assistants which can support both speech and text-based input.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.diplomaticsales.mercedes-benz.com/passengercars/being-an-owner/ask-mercedes-campaign/stage.module.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
The [[noun phrase]] ''owner's manual'' has been used by [[analogy]] in the title of numerous instructional books about entities that are not manufactured products, such as [[pet]]s, body parts and [[business]]es.

== User guides ==
The equivalent document for [[computer software]] is called a [[user guide]] since [[User (computing)|users]] are typically [[license]]es rather than [[owner]]s of the software.

== Unicode ==
The OPEN BOOK ([[Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs|📖]]) Unicode symbol equals ''read operator's manual''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F300.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; OPEN BOOK has Unicode code point U+1F4D6.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2877">The '''Pahargarh caves''' are a [[cave complex]] containing [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] [[Cave painting|paintings]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]], near the village of [[Pahargarh]]. The most prominent of the caves is known locally as '''Likhichhaj'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://morena.nic.in/VisitingSabalgarh.html|title=Cave paintings in the cave shelters|last=|first=|date=|website=The Worth Visiting Places of Distt|publisher=Morena District|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings were discovered in 1979 by D. P. S. Dwarikesh, a professor of [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Michigan]], and Shri Ram Sharma, a civil engineer from Pahargarh. Dwarikesh and Sharma conducted preliminary surveys of the caves, documenting over 600 paintings, and speculated that there were thousands more. However, they were not able to obtain permission to excavate and the caves have not been investigated since.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/western_news/1039/|title=India cave project gets preliminary grant OK|last=|first=|date=4 December 1980|work=Western News|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issue=14|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/pahargarh-caves-clues-to-india-prehistory/1/402256.html|title=Pahargarh caves: A wealth of archaeological treasure|last=Bobb|first=Dilip|date=15 October 1981|work=India Today|access-date=2017-07-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Made with red and white [[ochre]]-based paints, the depictions include human and animal figures as well as abstract shapes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The dating of the paintings is uncertain. According to Dwarikesh, [[ostrich]] [[Eggshell|egg shells]] discovered in the caves were [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to 25,000 years ago,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; but they also discovered [[Iron Age in India|Iron Age]] artefacts dating to ca. 1500 BCE and the paintings themselves depict tools consistent with a date of 600 BCE.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMOgcqNS4bs&amp;t=3s&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Claude Perrault]]'s Colonnade''' is the easternmost façade of the [[Palais du Louvre]] in [[Paris]].
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="220"&gt;
File:Louvre-facade-est.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;
It has been celebrated as the foremost masterpiece of [[French Baroque and Classicism|French Architectural Classicism]] since its construction, mostly between 1667 and 1670. Cast in a restrained classicizing baroque manner, it interprets rules laid down by the ancient Roman architect [[Vitruvius]], whose works Perrault had translated into French. Architect [[Louis Le Vau]] and artist [[Charles Le Brun]] also contributed to the realization of Perrault's work.

==Description==
[[File:Louvre - Élévation de la principale facade au côté de Saint-Germain-l'Auxerrois - Architecture françoise Tome4 Livre6 Pl7.jpg|thumb|Engraving of the east facade from [[Jacques-François Blondel|Blondel]]'s ''Architecture françoise'', 1756|500x500px]]

Little that could be called [[Baroque]] can be identified in Perrault’s cool classicism that looks back to the 16th century. The façade, divided into five parts, is a typical solution of French classicism. The simple character of the ground floor basement sets off the [[Сoupled column|paired]] [[Corinthian column]]s, modeled strictly according to Vitruvius, against a shadowed void, with pavilions at the ends. This idea of coupled columns on a high podium goes back as far as [[Bramante]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Summerson|Summerson, John]] (1963), ''The Classical Language of Architecture'', [[London]] and [[New York City|New York]]: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], pg 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Those rhythmical columns form a shadowed colonnade with a central [[pediment]]ed [[triumphal arch]] entrance raised on a high, rather defensive base. Crowned by an uncompromising Italian [[balustrade]] along its distinctly non-French flat roof, the whole ensemble represents a ground-breaking departure in French architecture.
[[File:East facade of Louvre, Paris September 2013.jpg|thumb|The colonnade in 2013]]

==History==
[[File:Lifting of the Louvre pediment stones 1674 by Le Clerc - Berger 1993 fig86.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The lifting of the Louvre pediment stones, 1674, engraving by [[Sébastien Leclerc (1637–1714)|Sébastien Leclerc]]]]

Perrault (1613–1688) won the competition held by [[Louis XIV]] for a design for the eastern façade of the Louvre Palace, beating out even [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], who had traveled from Italy expressly for the purpose. This work consumed Perrault from 1665 to 1680, and established his reputation: the severely designed colonnade overlooking the [[Place du Louvre]] — for which buildings including the [[Hôtel du Petit-Bourbon]] were demolished to provide the necessary urban space — became widely celebrated.

In 1964, the French [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]], [[André Malraux]], ordered the digging out of the dry moat  in front of Perrault’s Colonnade. A characteristic feature of French classical architecture, it is shown in nearly every project and early drawing of the east facade, and its reexcavation revealed the original ''soubassement'', or podium (see the engraving from Blondel's book). The moat may have been filled in around 1674 to facilitate construction (see the engraving by [[Sébastien Leclerc (1637–1714)|Sébastien Leclerc]]) and not restored due to lack of funds to build the ''contrescarpe'' after Louis XIV's attention shifted to the [[Palace of Versailles]]. However, in 1981 [[Germain Bazin]] argued that the reconstruction of the moat was misguided, since for aesthetic reasons Louis XIV had never wanted it.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1993, p. 63. Berger cites Whiteley &amp; Braham 1969 and Bazin 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
For centuries, Perrault’s Colonnade has provided a model for many grand edifices in Europe and America:

'''Plastered human skulls''' are reconstructed human skulls that were made in the ancient [[Levant]] between 7000 and 6000 BC in the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] period. They represent some of the oldest forms of art in the [[Middle East]] and demonstrate that the prehistoric population took great care in burying their [[ancestors]] below their homes. The skulls denote some of the earliest sculptural examples of [[portrait]]ure in the [[history of art]].

==Discovery==
One skull was accidentally unearthed in the 1930s by the archaeologist [[John Garstang]] at [[Jericho]] in the [[West Bank]]. A number of plastered skulls from Jericho were discovered by the British archaeologist [[Kathleen Kenyon]] in the 1950s and can now be found in the collections of the [[British Museum]], the [[Ashmolean Museum]], the [[Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge|Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]], the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], the [[Nicholson Museum]] in Sydney and the [[Jordan Archaeological Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;ROM Collection [http://images.rom.on.ca/public/index.php?function=image&amp;action=simpledetail&amp;image_name=ROM2004_1044_7 ROM Images. "Plastered Human Skull."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ashmolean.org/collections/highlights/?type=highlights&amp;id=33&amp;department=1|title=TREASURES {{!}} Ashmolean Museum|website=www.ashmolean.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://maa.cam.ac.uk/maa-highlights/middleeast/israel_palestine/388/|title=MAA - Features|website=maa.cam.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sites where plastered skulls were excavated include [[Ain Ghazal]] and [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], and [[Tell Ramad]], [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/p/plastered_skull.aspx The British Museum. "Plastered Skull."]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the plastered skulls were from adult males, but some belonged to women and children.

==Archaeological significance==
The plastered skulls represent some of the earliest forms of burial practices in the southern [[Levant]]. During the [[Neolithic]] period, the deceased were often buried under the floors of their homes.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; Sometimes the skull was removed, and its cavities filled with plaster and painted. In order to create more lifelike faces, [[Seashell|shells]] were inset for eyes, and paint was used to represent facial features, hair, and [[moustaches]].&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/the-neolithic-revolution.html German, Senta. "The Neolithic Revolution."]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars believe that this burial practice represents an early form of [[ancestor worship]], where the plastered skulls were used to commemorate and respect family ancestors.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; Other experts argue that the plastered skulls could be linked to the practice of head hunting, and used as trophies. Plastered skulls provide evidence about the earliest arts and [[religious]] practices in the [[ancient Near East]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13055">The following is '''a list of unproduced [[Ridley Scott]] projects''' in roughly chronological order. During his long career, English film director [[Ridley Scott]] has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his direction. Some of these projects, fell in [[development hell]] or are officially canceled.

== 1970s ==

=== ''Tristan and Isolde'' ===
In the mid-1970s, before the beginning of the filming of ''[[The Duellists]]'', Scott pitched the idea of a film adaptation of [[medieval]] romantic [[legend]] of ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'', and he planned to release this film as his second movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Evan Jacobs |url=http://movieweb.com/exclusive-setting-the-period-with-tristan-isolde-executive-producer-ridley-scott/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: Setting the Period With Tristan + Isolde Executive Producer Ridley Scott |website=Movieweb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project never materialized at the time, and Scott pitched the idea of ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' during the filming of ''The Duellists'' as a replacement of this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Franco |first=James |url=http://www.newsweek.com/james-francos-favorite-mistake-filming-tristan-isolde-63903 |title=James Franco’s Favorite Mistake: Filming Tristan &amp; Isolde |website=Newsweek.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film, [[Tristan &amp; Isolde (film)|Tristan &amp; Isolde]], was finally released in 2006 with [[Kevin Reynolds (director)|Kevin Reynolds]] as the director and with Scott as the producer.

== 1980s ==

=== ''Dune'' ===
Around 1981, Scott was hired to direct a film adaptation of [[Frank Herbert]]'s novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel D. Snyder |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/03/the-messy-misunderstood-glory-of-david-lynchs-em-dune-em/284316/ |title=The Messy, Misunderstood Glory of David Lynch's Dune |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Scott was finally replaced by [[David Lynch]], and the [[Dune (film)|film]] was released in 1984.

== 1990s ==

=== ''Crisis in the Hot Zone'' ===
In February 1994, Scott signed a deal with [[20th Century Fox]] to direct a film adaptation of [[Richard Preston]]'s article ''[[The Hot Zone|Crisis in the Hot Zone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-02-14-1994-1 |title=Now displaying the Daily Variety for February 14, 1994 |website=Varietyultimate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late April 1994, [[Robert Redford]] and [[Jodie Foster]] were in talks for star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-05-02-1994-13 |title=Now displaying the Weekly Variety for May 02, 1994 |website=Varietyultimate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was finally shut down due to many production problems and Foster's departure from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-19-1994-1 |title=Now displaying the Daily Variety for August 19, 1994 |website=Varietyultimate.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''I Am Legend'' ===
On July 2, 1997, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Scott had signed a contract with [[Warner Bros.]] to direct the third film adaptation of [[Richard Matheson]]'s novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]''.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|author=Anita M. Busch |url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/scott-is-stuff-of-legend-1116677570/ |title=Scott is stuff of ‘Legend’ |publisher=Variety |date=1997-07-02 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] was attached to portray Dr. Robert Neville&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and [[Mark Protosevich]] was attached to write the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Padraig Cotter |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/i-am-legend/43440/the-legend-of-ridley-scott-s-i-am-legend |title=The legend of Ridley Scott’s I Am Legend |publisher=[[Den of Geek]] |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project was finally cancelled due to budgetary concerns on March 16, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-03-16/news/9803160197_1_legend-hollywood-reporter-million-budget |title=Schwarzenegger's 'Legend' Is In Peril |website=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1998-03-16 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was subsequently revived and in 2007 [[I Am Legend (film)|the film]] was released with [[Francis Lawrence]] as director and with [[Will Smith]] in the lead role.

== 2000s ==

=== ''Alien 5'' ===
In an interview on January 23, 2002, Scott expressed his desire to make a fifth installment in the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson |first=Paul |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2002/01/23/alien-vs-predator-battle-of-the-sequels |title=Alien vs. Predator: Battle of the Sequels |publisher=IGN |date=2002-01-23 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the fifth film would explain the Aliens' origins and where they were discovered.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; [[James Cameron]] was attached to return as writer and producer.&lt;ref name=Reddit-JamesCameron-AMA-20140412&gt; {{cite web |url=  https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22uz4m/i_am_james_cameron_ama/cgqn1y0/ |title= I am James Cameron. AMA. |date= 12 April 2014 |author= James Cameron |publisher= Reddit |work= Ask Me Anything }} &lt;/ref&gt; However, the project was finally shelved by [[20th Century Fox]] (since they thought that they would ruin the franchise with a fifth film) due to the production of the spin-off ''[[Prometheus (2012 film)|Prometheus]]'', and ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' was released in 2004 instead, as the first installment of the [[Alien vs. Predator|''Alien vs. Predator'' spin-off franchise.]]

=== ''Gladiator 2'' ===
On September 11, 2003, Scott expressed interest in direct the [[Gladiator 2|planned sequel]] to his successful ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2003/09/11/ridley-talks-gladiator-2 |title=Ridley Talks Gladiator 2 |publisher=IGN |date=2003-09-11 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that Scott and [[Russell Crowe]] stated that they wanted to hire [[Nick Cave]] for rewrite the sequel's script.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes-2006-05-08"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1646784/ridley_lays_quotgladiator_2quot_to_rest |publisher= Rotten Tomatoes |title= Ridley Lays "Gladiator 2" to Rest |author= Scott Weinberg |date= 8 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117094059/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/news/1646784/ridley_lays_quotgladiator_2quot_to_rest |archive-date= 2011-01-17 |dead-url=no}} &lt;/ref&gt; However, at the end, Cave's script was rejected and Scott and Crowe cancelled plans for a sequel in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/06/nick-cave-rejected-gladiator-script|title=Nick Cave's rejected Gladiator 2 script uncovered!|first=Sean|last=Michaels|date=6 May 2009|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== ''Blood Meridian'' ===
On May 10, 2004, Scott revealed his intentions to make, along with screenwriter [[William Monahan]] and producer [[Scott Rudin]], a [[Blood Meridian (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s acclaimed novel ''[[Blood Meridian]]'',&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2004/05/10/ridley-onboard-blood-meridian |title=Ridley Onboard Blood Meridian? |publisher=IGN |date=2004-05-10 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a project that  had tried to be filmed in the past by various other filmmakers, like screenwriter [[Steve Tesich]] and actor [[Tommy Lee Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://movieweb.com/william-monahan-to-adapt-blood-meridian/ |title=William Monahan to adapt Blood Meridian |website=Movieweb.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paramount Pictures]] was set to develop the feature,&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; and in June 2008, during an interview with ''Eclypse Magazine'', Scott stated that the script was written, but it contained much violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eclipsemagazine.com/hollywood-insider/interview-the-great-ridley-scott-speaks-with-eclipse-by-scott-essman/5812 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604172245/http://eclipsemagazine.com/hollywood-insider/interview-the-great-ridley-scott-speaks-with-eclipse-by-scott-essman/5812 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-06-04 |title=INTERVIEW: The great Ridley Scott Speaks with Eclipse by Scott Essman &amp;#124; EclipseMagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on August 17, 2008, Rudin stated that Scott and Monahan had left the project and that director [[Todd Field]] would direct it instead than Scott.&lt;ref name="JMedinaLAT"&gt;{{cite news |author= Medina, Jeremy|title= Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian film changes directors |publisher= ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|date= August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Todd Field still working hard on Blood Meridian|url= http://www.talkingfilms.net/todd-field-still-working-hard-on-blood-meridian|date= January 14, 2010|accessdate= April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Untitled Lucius Verus spin-off ===
In 2006, [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported plans for a ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' spin-off. [[DreamWorks]] had approached Scott with the intentions of producing a spin-off with [[Maximus Decimus Meridius|Lucius Verus]] as the main character.&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes-2006-05-08"/&gt; However, after the cancellation of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)#Possible sequel|Gladiator 2]]'', any further proposals for a sequel or spin-off were quickly abandoned.

=== ''Metropolis'' ===
In the 2000s, Scott mooted a sequel to 1982's ''[[Blade Runner]]'' under the title "Metropolis".&lt;ref name=isbn9780810869523-pp225&gt; {{cite book |page= 225 |title= The Ridley Scott Encyclopedia |author= Laurence Raw |publisher= Scarecrow Press |year= 2009 |isbn= 9780810869523 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Purefold'' ===
On June 4, 2009,''[[The New York Times]]'' revealed that Scott along with his now-deceased brother [[Tony Scott]] were working on a [[Web series|webseries]] inspired by ''[[Blade Runner]]'' with episodes of 5 or 10 minutes, that, according to Ridley, it could have also been transmitted on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone |first=Brad |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/web-series-tied-to-blade-runner-is-in-the-works/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223044740/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/web-series-tied-to-blade-runner-is-in-the-works/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-02-23 |title=Web Series Tied to 'Blade Runner' Is In the Works - NYTimes.com |date=2014-02-23 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, it was reported that the production of the series was cancelled due to funding problems.

== 2010s ==

=== ''Robin Hood 2'' ===
On April 4, 2010, Scott revealed his hopes of making a sequel to ''[[Robin Hood (2010 film)|Robin Hood]]'' and more films after that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://login.thetimes.co.uk/?gotoUrl=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/film/ |title=Film |website=Loginthetimes.co./uk |accessdate=2016-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201065415/https://login.thetimes.co.uk/?gotoUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetimes.co.uk%2Ftto%2Farts%2Ffilm%2F |archivedate=2016-12-01 |df= }} {{subscription required|date=December 2016}} {{pn|date=November 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2010, [[Russell Crowe]] expressed his desire to reprise his role as [[Robin Hood|Robin Longstride/Robin Hood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collett |first=Mike |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cannes-idUKTRE64A6N620100513?pageNumber=1 |title=Robin Hood opens Cannes, Crowe hints at sequel &amp;#124; Reuters |website=Uk.reuters.com |date=2010-05-13 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, plans for the sequel fell in [[development hell]], with anticipation of an update being made after this announcement.

=== Untitled Sci-fi short films ===
On March 12, 2013, [[Tubefilter]] reported that Scott would work with [[Machinima]] in the production of twelve [[science fiction]] short films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gutelle |first=Sam |url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/03/12/ridley-scott-machinima-sci-fi/ |title=Ridley Scott Will Create New Batch Of Sci-Fi Classics For Machinima |website=Tubefilter.com |date=2013-03-12 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on November 21 of that year, Scott reported that the Sci-Fi shorts project was canceled due the end of the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=Joshua |url=http://www.tubefilter.com/2013/11/21/machinima-ridley-scott-cancel-series-of-sci-fi-shorts/ |title=Machinima And Ridley Scott Cancel Plans For Series Of Sci-Fi Shorts |website=Tubefilter.com |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Rio Grande"''' is a psychedelic western saga co-written by [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Andy Paley]] and co-produced by Brian Wilson and [[Lenny Waronker]] for [[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson's first solo album]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morethings.com/music/best_albums_generation_1985-2005.htm The True and Objective List of the Best 100 Albums of This Generation (1985-2005)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Its modular set of movements hearkened back to the style that Brian Wilson used during the "[[Good Vibrations]]"/''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' era with [[musique concrète]]. "Rio Grande" was evidence that he could still create brilliant, pictorial landscapes of music similar to ''Smile'' whenever he had the freedom, confidence, and courage to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/4/2004_4_40.shtml AmericanHeritage.com / Brian Wilson's Wave&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304235304/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/4/2004_4_40.shtml |date=2006-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the longest piece of music in the Brian Wilson catalogue at eight minutes and 12 seconds.

Although it did not contain [[Van Dyke Parks]]' imagery or have the out-of-the-box, ambitious enlightenment of the ''Smile''-era work, it gave ''[[Brian Wilson (album)|Brian Wilson]]'' the progressive relativity of a genuine comeback album. Mostly, "Rio Grande" unmasked a notion of the old Brian Wilson and helped bridge a gap between the original ''Smile'' and the long-awaited, eventual 2004 release of ''[[Smile (Brian Wilson album)|Smile]]''.

==Creation of "Rio Grande"==
Waronker and [[Seymour Stein]], the President of Sire Records, encouraged Wilson to make an impressionistic collage that had made ''Smile'' an interesting listening experience. [[Eugene Landy]] suggested to Brian to make a suite about the development of an individual. However, it was [[Lenny Waronker]] who insinuated to Brian to undertake a more complex, revealing, and provisional composition with an Old West theme &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adriandenning.co.uk/brian.html Brian Wilson | album reviews | adriandenning.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the [[Howard Hawks]] film ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' and also the movie ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]''. A Hawaiian theme was also being considered at the time but was dropped in favor of a Western theme. Work on "Rio Grande" began on October 1, 1987, which happened at the same time as a Los Angeles earthquake. A similar concept being worked on during the same period involved "Saturday Morning in the City" and "Saturday Evening in the City" about describing an ordinary Californian suburban weekend but was soon dropped. Early titles before "Rio Grande" was chosen included 'Baby, Child, Adult,' 'Child, Adult, and Parent,' and "Life's Suite." The lyrics of "Life's Suite" (pun intended), written by Landy, were brought in at the last moment and were rejected out of hand by Waronker.

==Relation to ''Smile''==
The idea of "Rio Grande" was conceived as far back as 1970 when Waronker came by Brian's Bellagio mansion with Brian playing him the basic melody of "Cool, Cool Water." {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}Waronker got the notion if he ever got the chance to produce him; he would want a synthesis of the commercial "Good Vibrations" combined with the pacific "Cool, Cool Water" leading to "Rio Grande" years later. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}Its different "feels" and movements relate specifically to "[[Cabin Essence]]", "Cool, Cool Water", and most of all, "[[Heroes and Villains]]." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7813 Rio Grande by Brian Wilson Songfacts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaic suite could easily be compared to the Who's "[[A Quick One While He's Away]]" and "Rael" as a mini-rock opera. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}It also would easily have been perfect for the unrealized Americana theme on the original ''Smile''. {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}The ending of the short snippet of "Walk On By" on the Friends/20/20 two-fer is reminiscent of "Mrs. O'Leary's Cow" which later showed up in the middle of Part C of "Rio Grande" (see below). {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}"Rio Grande" was recorded in sections at different studios across Los Angeles to sound like one cohesive work like earlier ''Smile'' recordings.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Sections==
===Part A: (0:01–0:57 minutes)===
The first part, Part A, starts off with [[Calliope (music)|calliope]]-like music similar to the "[[The Elements (Beach Boys song)|Fire]]" music he had created 20 years before. The Baystate [[Bluegrass music|Bluegrass]] Band contributed to the suite as well as other different groups as stated above. 'Ride 'Em Cowboy' is repeated in a chant similar to his work on ''Smile'' (e.g. "[[You're Welcome]]", "With Me Tonight"). It segues into Part B with a steam engine whistle similar to the ending of "[[Roll Plymouth Rock]]" on the 2004 ''Smile''.

===Part B: (0:58–2:42)===
Part B is the main theme of "Rio Grande" like an old [[cowboy]] song sung by [[Gene Autry]] or [[Roy Rogers]]. It has a riff similar to one from The Beach Boys' "That Same Song." Part B is meta-physical and autobiographical in the sense of the 'river-as-allegory-of-life' idea, and the main character 'would swim the river but can't.' The [[Rio Grande]] also takes him on an adventure or journey like a [[Lewis and Clark]] expedition. It evokes images of [[Lone Ranger]], [[Tom Mix]], and [[Hopalong Cassidy]] as well as other iconic Western figures and makes explicit reference to the [[Cherokee Trail]]. In an earlier version of "Rio Grande", Part B included "Cool, Cool Guy" but was left out in the released version.

===Part C: (2:43–3:56)===
In Part C, the listener is taken to what sounds like a [[campfire]] vignette before being interrupted by a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[rain dance]] followed by thunder and rain. The wordless vocal lines are similar to the "Fire" music from ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''.

===Part D: (3:57–6:11)===
"Take Me Home" is the name of Part D, in which the music slows down to a dream-like state where the main character is thinking about his girl who on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodhumorsmile.com/page18.htm Heroes and Villains&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It sounds like a variation of Part B before ending with a vocal segue.

===Part E: (6:12–7:02)===
Part E is the profound "Night Bloomin' Jasmine" section, which was written in 1979. It was one of a short list of songs or pieces by Wilson written in a minor key. An early version was recorded in 1982 with [[Dennis Wilson|brother Dennis]] at the infamous "hamburger sessions" and/or "cocaine sessions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lovesurroundsme.tripod.com/nightbloomin.html Night Blooming&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The odd 'Get A Job' interlude in the early version was excluded from the final version.

===Part F: (7:03–8:12)===
The music in the last section is a reprise of Part B, bringing the journey full-circle in which the main character experienced one man out in the wilderness against nature, the old west, and the great outdoors. Like the opposites in ''Smile'' such as "Heroes and Villains" and 'Lost &amp; Found' in Cabin Essence,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.cthome.net/tobelman/page03.htm The Opposites&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; opposites exist in "Rio Grande." These include: big man against little man, cowboy against Indian, and all men against nature. The opus closes with a thick, heavy drum being slammed.

'''''Saint John the Evangelist''''' is a 1635–1636 painting by [[Francesco Furini]], which has been in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] since 1987.

It was inspired by the work of [[Caravaggio]] and was commissioned by the painter's patron marquess Vitelli. The facial features show it was based on the same model as the artist's ''Apollo the Archer'' ([[Columbia University]]) and for various female allegorical figures.

'''''Sinfonía de Antígona''''' (''[[Antigone]] Symphony'') is [[Carlos Chávez]]'s Symphony No. 1, composed in 1933. The music originated as theatre music to accompany the tragedy of Antigone, hence the title of the symphony. The material was reworked into a single movement and rescored for a large orchestra. It lasts about 11 minutes in performance.

==History==
The ''Sinfonía de Antígona'' originated from the incidental music Chávez composed for a production of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' tragedy ''[[Antigone]]'', given by the group Teatro Orientación at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in Mexico City in 1932. Chávez re-shaped some of the musical materials and orchestrated the result as his First Symphony. It was premiered in Mexico City under the composer's baton on 15 December 1933 ({{harvnb|Slonimsky|1945|loc=233–34}}; {{harvnb|Orbón|1987c|loc=79}}). Two movements of the original theatre music, for a chamber ensemble of seven players, was eventually published by the composer's estate as ''Antígona, apuntes para la Sinfonía'' (Antigone, sketches for the Symphony) {{harv|Chávez|2000}}.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for piccolo, flute, alto flute, oboe, cor anglais, [[Heckelphone]], E{{Music|flat}} clarinet, two clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons, eight horns, three trumpets, bass tuba, timpani, percussion (three players), two harps, and strings.

==Analysis==
Chávez employs a modal language consciously borrowed from the [[Musical system of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek musical system]], in particular the Greek [[Dorian mode#Greek Dorian mode|Dorian]] and [[Hypodorian mode|Hypodorian]], including the Dorian [[chromatic genus]]. The obsessive use throughout the symphony of the two consecutive semitones of this genus creates a ritual atmosphere {{harv|Orbón|1987b|loc=82}}. The rhythms sometimes employ 5/8 time, taken from the ancient Greek paeonic (or cretic) meter (García Morillo 1960, 76). The harmonic idiom employed by Chávez in this symphony systematically avoids conventional [[triad (music)|triads]], replacing them with [[Quartal and quintal harmony|quartal harmonies]] generated by superimposing fourths {{harv|Orbón|1987b|loc=83}}.

Although there are no programmatic references, the music's bleak and austere character reflects the drama for which it was originally created. The sparse orchestration contributes to the remote strangeness of the music through unusual unison and octave doublings, such as piccolo, clarinet, and trumpet; piccolo and Heckelphone; and oboe, clarinet, and Heckelphone {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=69–70}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">Indigenous Mexican art celebrates the skeleton and uses it as a regular motif.  The use of skulls and skeletons in art originated before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Conquest]]: The [[Aztecs]] excelled in stone sculptures and created striking carvings of their Gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2008/may/02/skullartisnotanewidea|title=Skull art is not a new idea|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=2 May 2008|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coatlicue]], the Goddess of earth and death, was portrayed with a necklace of human hearts, hands and a skull pendant. She was imbued with the drama and grandeur necessary to dazzle the subject people and to convey the image of an implacable state. The worship of death involved worship of life, while the skull – symbol of death – was a promise to resurrection. The Aztecs carved skulls in monoliths of lava, and made masks of [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] and jade. Furthermore, the skull motif was used in decoration. They were molded on pots, traced on scrolls, woven into garments, and formalized into hieroglyphs.

==Spanish invasion==
When the Spanish invaded and conquered [[Tenochtitlan]] in the sixteenth century, they imposed the  [[Catholic]] religion and Spanish folk-practices of the era. This included the pagan tradition of celebrating the dead with food-offerings and feasts. However, the Spanish priests were eager to discontinue these ancient traditions that found fertile ground in Mexico. The Spanish suppressed the Mexican skull art tradition because it was too ''Indito'' or pagan for their refined European tastes. Not until Mexico won its independence from Spain in 1821, did skull art begin to re-emerge as a symbol of ''Mexicanidad''.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Reign of Porfirio Díaz==
When [[Porfirio Díaz]] became president, he was burdened with a bankrupt economy. To help the economic situation in Mexico, Díaz encouraged foreign investments. Investors were pleased with Mexico's cheap labor force. The Mexican–Indian laborer worked under cruel conditions. [[José Guadalupe Posada]], Mexican engraver, with his drawing criticized the conditions in Mexico.
Jose Guadalupe Posada is probably the most important Mexican artist of our times. During his lifetime, Posada was a witness to the crucial social and political changes which shaped Mexico into a modern nation. Changes such as the downfall of a dictator, a wide – spread social revolution, and the struggle for a power combined with the birth of a democratic process, all these experiences deeply influenced him. Through his work, he documented these occurrences and became a pictorial historian.

==José Guadalupe Posada==
[[File:Posada1.Quijote.jpeg|thumb|Posada's Skull art was a chilling message]]
Posada's drawings brought an awakening to the common man. He made those who could not read to understand what was happening in their country. Although the use of skulls and skeletons in art had been suppressed by foreign influences, it was still recognized among the poor in their celebrations of the Day of the Dead.
Using skull art was Posada's way to make a connection with the popular audience. Reproduced on box lids is his most famous engraving – [[la Calavera Catrina]] – which shows a fashionable lady in the guise of a skeleton. [[Diego Rivera]] called José Guadalupe Posada the greatest Mexican people's artist. From this influence, Rivera painted common people living and working in their environment. His work also carried a social message.
Posada and Rivera deeply influenced the Jaliscano [[Jorge González Camarena]], who disregarded the traditional methods and embraced the popular art of Posada and Rivera. Recurring battle scenes appear in González Camarena's work where Revolutionary soldiers become part of the ancient Mexican history as their lifeless bodies change into skeletons.[[File:Gran calavera eléctrica2.jpg|thumb|José Guadalupe Posada's version of Skull art used as a political message to those who did not know how to read.]]

==Frida Kahlo==
[[Frida Kahlo]] was also the product of a bold and brilliant generation that looked back with devotion to its Mexican roots and valued the reality it found there, uncontaminated by foreign influence. She admitted having a great deal of admiration for her husband's work, as well as that of Jose Guadalupe Posada and she found great beauty in the highly developed pre-Conquest indigenous art.

==Surrealists==
Frida was claimed early on by [[André Breton]] and the Surrealists as one of their own, and for a time she did not mind to be caught up and identified with the chic vanguard movement. But, later she declared herself not one of them because she said "I painted dreams, I painted my own reality." In the 1940s she painted "The Dream," where a conscious skeleton floats above the sleeping Frida. The Mexican brujos say "to live is to sleep and to die is to awaken." For Frida, perhaps, death like dreams exists in parallel.
[[File:The Kid - Diego Rivera.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Rivera]]'s Skull art expression]]

==Chucho Reyes==
While Frida's work focused on ''Mexicanidad'', Chucho Reyes integrated European fine art styles with the essence of the popular Mexican skull art. Perhaps his art was politically unpopular for those who chose to disregard foreign influences. However, Reye's unconventional combination was most likely influenced by his eccentric father who, although devoutly Catholic, practiced [[brujeria]]. He slept in a bed where [[rooster]]s were tied to each bedpost and a large eye was painted above his bed on the ceiling. This mixture of European religious beliefs with Mexican witchcraft was what most likely inspired Reyes to combine different artistic styles. Art like this will take quite a while to master

==Superstitions and saints==
Although modernly the ancient Aztec religious traditions that have remained are called brujeria by those who practice European religions, in [[Oaxaca]] – superstitions and saints are spoken in the same breath.

==Rufino Tamayo &amp; the Oaxacan School==
[[Rufino Tamayo]] founded the Oaxacan school of painting on the principle that although painting must take place on the plastic level, it does not exclude the possibility that the work contain a profound consequence not altogether expressed. Tamayo seemed to strip away man's external self, found for instance in religion, in order to examine man's fundamental fears. His fear of nature, of the cosmos, and above everything else, man's fear of himself. The subtle and rich art of pre-Columbian times greatly inspired Tamayo. From this influence he painted man as a transparent flesh existing on a living skeleton.

==Francisco Toledo==
On the other hand, [[Francisco Toledo]] painted his subjects as if they were x-rays. Salacious curiosity with the inner being becomes almost pornographic as his erotic and irreverent resurgence of Skull Art comes forward.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: La Muerte Agachada.jpg|thumb|Francisco Toledo's La Muerte Agachada (Falling over with laughter)]] --&gt;

==Rodolfo Nieto==
While Rufino Tamayo founded the Oaxacan School, it was [[Rodolfo Nieto]][http://www.RodolfoNieto.com] who defined it. Rodolfo added a dramatic tone to skull art. Using light colors fixed against dark hues, he showed the continual battle of life and death. With gaiety, humor, whimsies, and boyhood stories of [[Tarzan]] the Ape Man fighting the perils of the jungle, Rodolfo laughed at death while living in the shadows of his own deepening depression.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Flashes of light confused by color, juxtaposed against the stark black canvasses, he did not attempt to define human existence, but just to live it, knowing that the skull was always within him.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  His painter wife Nancy Nieto removed the fleshy mask of life in order to examine the basis of life, the skull and skeleton..... &lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image: Calavera de Monzo.jpg|thumb|Rodolfo Nieto's "Calavera de Monzo" preception of Skull Art, a way he laughed at his own approaching death]] --&gt;

==Chicano / Mexican – American==
Often Chicano or Mexican American artists turn to their history, recently and notably Nancy Nieto brings a bold resurgence to the ancient tradition of Mexican skull art.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:La Musica.jpg|thumb|Nancy Nieto's La Musica]]--&gt; Woven into a veil of rich colors and unconventional forms, adopted from the Oaxacan School, her work removes the veil of mystery the mystery of life only to reveal the mystery of death. She shows depths of mystery yet has a harmonious eurhythmic note of the epic origins of the chromatic [[Oaxaca]]. She struggles to re-address Francisco Toledo's erotic themes, and to step away from Rodolfo Nieto's dramatic tomes. Her work renews the Aztec view of death as a transitional cycle between the individual life and the ubiquitous "to be".

'''Solaris Pictures''' is perhaps the only [[India]]n [[film production]] company that has consistently been making bold and path-breaking films on issues such as [[homosexuality]] and [[gay rights]], films that engage the audience and initiate dialogues on issues dealing with health and sexuality, human rights, and the gay and transgender communities.

Solaris Pictures believes in pushing the envelope - both as [[Film producer|producer]] and as [[distributor]], and in partnering with grassroots [[NGO]]s and [[community-based organization]]s in India, and international collaborators from around the world. It produces films that go beyond mere entertainment, to emotionally engage the audience and initiate dialogues about underserved issues like health and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[human rights]], [[gay]] and [[transgender]] issues.

Thei social awareness films and spots for the [[National Institute for Hearing Handicapped]], [[Cancer Patients Aid Association]] and Cama &amp; Albless Hospital have been telecast on both [[DD National]] and [[Mumbai]] [[Doordarshan]].

Solaris Pictures is one of the principal organizers of [[Kashish Mumbai Queer Film Festival]] that was first held in April 2010 in Mumbai at [[PVR Cinemas]] and [[Alliance Francaise]] and then in 2011 and 2012 at [[Cinemax]] Versova and [[Alliance Francaise]]

Solaris Pictures has also organized [[Flashpoint Human Rights Film Festival]] in Mumbai and New Delhi in 2010/2011 and 2011/2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/Entertainment/Human-rights-film-festival-returns-in-Mumbai/Article1-779904.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming from a country like [[India]] that is still in denial, where being HIV+ is still a curse, [[68 Pages]] rips open the underbelly of its society to reveal how it stigmatizes and shuns those who are [[HIV+]] or even those who just want to be what they are. Through 68 Pages of a counselors diary, we see the stories of Paayal, a [[sex worker]]; Nishit, an ID user; Kiran, a [[gay]] man and Umrao, a [[transsexual]] bar dancer - their stories of pain and fear, humiliation and rejection - not only by the society, but even by their loved ones. While these stories expose the shallowness of the system, it also offers hope and healing by trying to bring about a better understanding of their fight to live with dignity. The film is a tribute to the human spirit of optimism and survival. { Source: imdb} [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1151299/]

[[The Pink Mirror]] pits two Indian [[drag queen]]s against a westernized gay teenager in a battle to woo a handsome hunk. It's a clash of the east and west. The drag queens, who are expert in the art of seduction with their wit, innuendo and cunning or the young teenager who is saucy, slutty and sly? Underneath the campy humorous exterior, the film is an exploration of the [[India]]n [[gay]] landscape and understanding of the deep, humanly tender bondings that exist between drag queens in India who form unique, non-patriarchal families. Using the [[Bollywood]] soap idiom of song, dance and drama and for the first time in the Indian drag queens' very own language, Hindi, the film also explores other veiled issues related to the Indian [[gay]] community: the lurking threat of [[HIV/AIDS]]. {Source: imdb} [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386499]

The '''House of Creativity "Staraya Ladoga"''' was an all-Russian centre for artistic creativity, which existed in the [[Volkhovsky District]] of [[Leningrad Oblast]] from the mid-20th century up to the 1990s. It was located opposite the ancient village of [[Staraya Ladoga]] on the right bank of the [[Volkhov River]].

== History ==
After the origination of the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists]], a question about the foundation of the house for vacation and creativity was stated. For this purpose in 1935, some accommodations were allocated in the Leningrad suburb [[Gatchina]].&lt;ref&gt;Л. С. Конова. Санкт-Петербургский Союз художников. Краткая хроника 1932-2009 // Петербургские искусствоведческие тетради. Выпуск 16. — СПб, 2009. — С.72.&lt;/ref&gt; The restoration of them began in 1936,&lt;ref&gt;Смета административно-хозяйственных расходов и планы ЛОССХ на 1936 год // Центральный Государственный Архив литературы и искусства. СПб. Ф.78. Оп.1. Д.3, Л.2.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[World War II]] intervened in it. [[Gatchina]] was occupied for almost three years during World War II. The [[Gatchina Palace]] was destroyed and the house for vacation and creativity, too. In February 1945, it was the second attempt of the foundation of this one. The ex-estate of the prince Nikolay Shakhovskoy in [[Staraya Ladoga]] was given up to Leningrad artists as a base zone for the rest and creative work.&lt;ref&gt;Стенографический отчёт заседания Правления ЛССХ совместно с Правлением Ленизо и Художественным фондом по обсуждению плана работ на 1945 год и о подготовке к выставке 1945 года // Центральный Государственный Архив литературы и искусства. СПб. Ф.78. Оп.1. Д.49, Л.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a good choice. Staraya Ladoga has always been drawing attention of Russian painters by the ancient barrows, architectural monuments and romantic views of the [[Volkhov River]]. There were the artists [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], [[Orest Kiprensky]], [[Aleksander Orłowski]], [[Ivan Ivanov (artist)|Ivan Ivanov]], [[Alexey Venetsianov]] and many others in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Н. В. Мурашова, Л. П. Мыслина. Дворянские усадьбы Санкт-Петербургской губернии. Южное Приладожье. Кировский и Волховский районы. — СПб, Алаборг, 2009. C. 207—224.&lt;/ref&gt; A future member of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] and the [[Peredvizhniki]] group [[Vassily Maximov]] was born and laid to rest there. He portrayed scenes from an everyday life of peasants.

Renowned artist [[Nicholas Roerich]] painted his sketches there during the summer of 1899. He named this landscape the best of the Russian one.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Д. П. Бучкин. О доме творчества «Старая Ладога» // Д. П. Бучкин. Гравюры и рассказы. — СПб, Бибилиотека «Невского альманаха», 2004. — С. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that a feeling of ancient Motherland could overfill the viewer when directing the look at Staraya Ladoga.&lt;ref name="База отдыха «Староладожская дача"&gt;[http://ladogadacha.ru/ База отдыха «Староладожская дача] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110200600/http://ladogadacha.ru/ |date=2015-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valentin Serov]], [[Konstantin Korovin]], [[Boris Kustodiev]] also worked there. [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]] was in Staraya Ladoga many times in 1924–26. He took part in the restoration of [[St. George's Church, Staraya Ladoga|St. George's Church]].&lt;ref&gt;А. Н. Самохвалов. Ладога, и не только Ладога // А. Н. Самохвалов. Мой творческий путь. — Л: Художник РСФСР, 1977. — С. 102 —113.&lt;/ref&gt; That experience gave a great deal to this artist: it helped him to understand the effect of joining a monumental painting with the architectural forms.&lt;ref&gt;А. Н. Самохвалов. В поисках монументальной выразительности // А. Н. Самохвалов. В годы беспокойного солнца. — СПб: Всемирное слово, 1996. — С. 193 —194.&lt;/ref&gt;
He painted his ''Staraya Ladoga'' (1924) and ''Family of Fisherman'' (1926, [[Russian Museum]]) there.&lt;ref&gt;Баршова И., Сазонова К. Александр Николаевич Самохвалов. — Л: Художник РСФСР, 1963. — С. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restoring works continued 15 years since 1946, meanwhile Leningrad artists began to work in Staraya Ladoga since 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Л. С. Конова. Санкт-Петербургский Союз художников. Краткая хроника 1932-2009 // Петербургские искусствоведческие тетради. Выпуск 20. — СПб, 2012. — С.176.&lt;/ref&gt;  Primarily artists stayed at the native country houses. The most popular was a house of an old woman Tatyana Egorovna, whose portrait we can find in numerous canvases. Many years this place was a plentiful source of inspiration for such artist as [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov|Sergei Osipov]], [[Gleb Savinov]], [[Nikolai Timkov]], [[Arseny Semionov]] and also for many others.&lt;ref&gt;А. Н. Семёнов, С. И. Осипов, К. А. Гущин. Выставка произведений. Каталог. Авт. вступ. статьи Г. Ф. Голенький. — Л: Художник РСФСР, 1977. — С. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an important center of the art life of Russia for 30 years a House of Creativity "Staraya Ladoga" began to work permanently in the beginning of 1960s after the finish of the restoration.&lt;ref name="iskusstvo.tv"&gt;[http://www.iskusstvo.tv/Vistavki/Dom-tvorchestva-hudozhnikov-Staraya-Ladoga.html Дом творчества художников «Старая Ладога» в галерее «Голубая гостиная» Санкт-Петербургского Союза художников]&lt;/ref&gt; Such artists as [[Evsey Moiseenko]], [[Alexander Nikolayevich Samokhvalov|Alexander Samokhvalov]], [[Vecheslav Zagonek]], [[Vladimir Ovchinnikov (painter)|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]], [[Boris Ugarov]], [[Boris Shamanov]], [[Vsevolod Bazhenov]], [[Piotr Buchkin]], [[Zlata Bizova]], [[Taisia Afonina]], [[Marina Kozlovskaya]], [[Dmitry Maevsky]], [[Alexander Semionov]], [[Arseny Semionov]], [[Vladimir Sakson]], [[Gleb Savinov]], [[Elena Zhukova]], [[Sergei Yefimovich Zakharov|Sergei Zakharov]], [[Ivan Varichev]], [[Veniamin Borisov]], [[Valery Vatenin]], [[Ivan Godlevsky]], [[Vladimir Krantz]], [[Lazar Yazgur]], [[Irina Dobrekova]], [[Pyotr Fomin]] and many other Leningrad and other regions painters and graphic artists worked there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socrealizm.com.ua|title=Socialist Realism|last=|first=|date=|website=Socialist Realism. Kiev club of collectors.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970-1980 a House of Creativity was widening, the new buildings were built. They used it a whole-year. A dwelling there for 1–2 months was without any payment for the artists. All commitments on accommodation, meals and journeys took the Art Foundation of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Paintings created there or based on the studies initiated by these places reached all genres painting and first of all landscape. Among them  ''[[Volkhov River]]. Last Snow'' (1967) by [[Nikolai Timkov]], ''Volhov.

Also it became a base of an extensive fount of painting, graphics and sculpture of the museum "Staraya Ladoga".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ladogamuseum.ru/about/funds/f1/ Фонд живописи, графики и скульптуры музея - заповедника «Старая Ладога»]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] and liquidation of the Art Foundation at the beginning of the 1990s, the House of Creativity lost its financial support and was closed. Since 2003, when the 1250th anniversary of [[Staraya Ladoga]] was celebrated, public efforts to revive it have been intensified.&lt;ref name="База отдыха «Староладожская дача"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iskusstvo.tv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nimrah.ru"/&gt;

"'''The Angel'''" ({{lang-da|Engelen}}) is a literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about an angel and a dead child gathering flowers to carry to Heaven. The tale was first published with three others in ''[[New Fairy Tales (1844)|New Fairy Tales]]'' by C.A. Reitzel in November [[1843 in literature|1843]].  The four tales were received by the Danish critics with great acclaim. A print depicting the angel and child became very popular.

== Plot ==
When the tale opens, a child has died, and an angel is escorting him to Heaven. They wander over the Earth for a while, visiting well-known places. Along the way they gather flowers to transplant into the gardens of Heaven. The angel takes the child to a poverty-stricken area where a dead field lily lies in a trash heap. The angel salvages the flower explaining that it had cheered a crippled boy before he died. The angel then reveals he was the boy, and the boy continued his journey.

== Themes ==
Jens Andersen, author of ''Hans Christian Andersen: A New Life'' (2005), describes God as "one of Andersen's most beloved ghosts" and notes that God  in "The Angel" is a "pleasant and helpful traveling companion [...] There are few figures in his works to whom he returns more often or examines from so many different childish angles". The poet had an unshakable faith that a whole new existence awaited him once his spirit left his earthly frame at the appropriate time. When Andersen was assailed with doubts regarding the soul's immortality, he reverted to his child faith and could not bring himself to suggest that the human being is simply dispersed as gases and other substances to fertilize the earth at death as the scientific Niels Bryde does in Andersen's 1857 novel ''To Be or Not to Be''. Andersen regarded God as a release for those suffering and a new chance for those who have failed. God was an optimistic and promising beginning for Andersen.&lt;ref name="JensAndersen"&gt;Andersen (Jens) 2005, pp. 330,537ff&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The tale is completely Andersen's invention, and may have been motivated by the death of the eldest daughter of his friends, Edvard and Jette Collins. The theme of a child transformed into an angel had possessed Andersen since the completion of his poem "The Dying Child".&lt;ref name="Wullschlager235"&gt;Wullschlager 2002, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gustav Hetsch, the story is one of three Andersen stories (along with "Beneath the Pillar and "The Nightingale") to have been inspired by [[Jenny Lind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hetsch |first=Gustav |date=July 1930 |title=Hans Christian Andersen's Interest in Music |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/738371?uid=3739696&amp;uid=2134&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21103777380097 |journal=The Musical Quarterly |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=322–329 |accessdate=March 31, 2014 |doi=10.1093/mq/xvi.3.322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history ==
[[File:Angel Andersen 01.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration by [[Vilhelm Pedersen]], Andersen's first illustrator]]

"The Angel" was first published in Copenhagen on 11&amp;nbsp;November 1843 by C. A. Reitzel in the first volume of the first collection of ''New Fairy Tales''. For the first time, the phrase "told for children" was not part of the title&amp;mdash;an omission Andersen scholar and biographer Jackie Wullschlager believes exhibited a new confidence on Andersen's part: "These [tales] were the most mature and perfectly constructed tales he had written, and though some of them at once became, and have remained favorites of children, Andersen here melds together the childlike and the profound with exceptional artistry."&lt;ref name="Wullschlager"&gt;Wullschlager 2002, pp. 230&amp;ndash;1,235&lt;/ref&gt;  The first edition of 850 was sold out by December 18, and Reitzel planned publication of another 850.&lt;ref name="Wullschlager"/&gt;

"The Angel" was the first tale in the volume that included "[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]", "[[The Sweethearts; or, The Top and the Ball]]",  and "[[The Ugly Duckling]]". The tale was republished 18&amp;nbsp;December 1849 in ''Fairy Tales'' and again on 15&amp;nbsp;December 1862 in ''Fairy Tales and Stories''.&lt;ref&gt;The Angel&lt;/ref&gt;

Wullschlager describes "The Angel" as a "sentimental genre picture [...] that suited the taste of the times."  A print made from an illustration of the tale by the German artist [[Wilhelm von Kaulbach]] was widely popular and sold briskly.  Andersen once found the print in Portugal, a country in which he was relatively unknown.&lt;ref name="Wullschlager235"/&gt;

== Critical response ==
''New Fairy Tales'' was a break-through for Andersen who, until its publication, had generally received vigorous condemnation from the Danish critics for his venture into the fairy tale genre. Reviews for the collection however were ecstatic.

'''''The Fog Warning''''' is  one of several paintings on marine subjects by the late-19th-century American painter [[Winslow Homer]] (1836–1910). Together with ''The Herring Net'' and ''[[Breezing Up]]'', painted the same year and also depicting the hard lives of fishermen in [[Maine]], it is considered among his best works on such topics.&lt;ref name=MFA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/the-fog-warning-31042|title=The Fog Warning: Halibut Fishing, 1885 |publisher=[[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] |accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WHFog&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winslowhomer.org/the-fog-warning.jsp |title=''The Fog Warning'', 1885 by Winslow Homer |publisher=Winslow Homer.org |accessdate=September 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Net&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winslowhomer.org/the-herring-net.jsp|title=''The Herring Net'', 1885 by Winslow Homer |publisher=Winslow Homer.org |accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

After initially making his reputation with paintings on themes related to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], in the late 1860s and through the 1870s Winslow Homer turned instead to painting people relaxing and at play: children, young women, [[genre painting]]s of farm and sea scenes. In 1881–82 he spent time in [[Cullercoats]], in northeast [[England]], and on his return to the US, settled for good in [[Prout's Neck, Maine]], where his father and brother had recently purchased a large amount of land. His brother had spent his honeymoon in Prout's Neck in 1875, and Winslow had visited him then.&lt;ref name=PMA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmuseum.org/homer/about-winslow-homer|title=About Winslow Homer|publisher=[[Portland Museum of Art]] |accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both these locations he returned to painting the sea with more serious themes, the hard and dangerous lives of the fishermen and their families, and "humankind’s life-and-death struggles against the sea and the elemental power of nature" throughout the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=PMA/&gt;

He had a studio built for him in Prout's Neck, which was completed in 1884. Here he painted ''The Fog Warning'', one of his three best paintings he completed there in 1885 depicting the lives of the local fishermen. These are considered among his best; the others are ''Lost on the Grand Banks'', and ''The Herring Net''.&lt;ref name=MFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHFog/&gt;&lt;ref name=Net/&gt; Many of his late paintings, like ''The Fog Warning'', depict a single figure at sea.&lt;ref name=WHFog/&gt; Another theme in many of his paintings of the fisherman's life was the bounty of the sea, which also provides the people's livelihood; the two are combined in this painting, which was originally exhibited under the title ''Halibut Fishing''.&lt;ref name=WHFog/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Winslow Homer.jpg|thumb|upright|Winslow Homer in 1890]]
The painting depicts a lone fisherman in a [[dory]] who has caught several [[halibut]] but now sees fog blowing up, threatening to cut him off as he rows back to his ship. His face is turned in profile to the viewer as he looks over his shoulder at the streamers of fog in the background.&lt;ref name=MFA/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHFog/&gt; The [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Boston Fine Art Museum]] gives this description:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Fog Warning is a painting with a narrative, though its tale is disturbing rather than charming. As indicated by the halibut in his dory, the fisherman in this picture has been successful. But the hardest task of the day, the return to the main ship, is still ahead of him. He turns to look at the horizon, measuring the distance to the mother ship, and to safety. The seas are choppy and the dory rocks high on the waves, making it clear that the journey home will require considerable physical effort. But more threatening is the approaching fog bank, whose streamers echo, even mock, the fisherman's profile.&lt;ref name=MFA/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The scene is psychologically tense; the risk of being lost at sea as a result of a sudden fog was all too real at the time, and the viewer does not know whether this man will reach his ship in time.&lt;ref name=MFA/&gt; The picture has been used in elementary-school education to teach about interpretation of art and fishermen's lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Children and Their Art: Methods for the Elementary School |first1=Al |last1=Hurwitz |first2=Michael |last2=Day |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2006 |page=405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies==
Several studies for the painting survive, among them a more intimate, less monumental version called ''Halibut Fishing''.&lt;ref name=midd&gt;{{cite book |title=American Paintings &amp; Historical Prints from the Middendorf Collection: A Catalogue of an Exhibition |first=John William |last=Middendorf |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] / [[Baltimore Museum of Art]] |year=1967 |oclc=1014725 |page=52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homer's handyman Henry Lee posed for the painting in a dory supported on a pile of sand.&lt;ref name=midd/&gt;

==Thematically related works==

In addition to ''Herring Nets'' and ''[[Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)|Breezing Up]]'', which share the focus on Maine fishermen, Homer's ''[[Lost on the Grand Banks]]'' (also 1885) and ''[[:File:Winslow Homer 005.jpg|After the Hurricane, Bahamas 1899]]'' depict tragedy at sea: the former another fisherman in mortal danger at sea, the latter one thrown up on shore dead. In contrast, in ''Summer Night'' (1890) the sea is raging in the background while in the middle ground people silhouetted against the waves watch, but in the foreground two girls are dancing, unconcerned.

{{Portal |Children's literature}}

'''''The Marzipan Pig''''' (1986, {{ISBN|0-374-34859-6}}) is a children's book by [[Russell Hoban]]. The plot involves a [[marzipan pig]] that has somehow fallen behind a couch. 

==Plot summary==
The pig laments being forgotten and as dust begins to cover him, he remains hopeful about someone discovering him. When he is eventually found (and eaten) by a mouse, parts of his personality are transferred to the mouse. The mouse in turn, falls in love with a nearby grandfather clock and comes to visit each night. The clock, of course, cannot reciprocate the mouse's love. One night the mouse leaves never to come back. The clock suddenly feels the loss and desperately awaits her return, finally knowing both tight loneliness and cold emptiness. Alas, she does not come back and when he is next wound up, his spring breaks.

The mouse, unbeknownst to the clock, has been eaten by an owl that falls in love with a lighted taxi meter and dances for rides. Where the mouse was eaten, a little pink flower grows up. A bee drinks the flower's nectar and shows its affection to a dying [[hibiscus]] flower. A rather snooty white mouse thinks she'd make a better hibiscus and uses the dead petals to make a dress. Then, trying to hang on the plant, she falls into a postman's bag and is thrown back to the owl. Back at the house, she finds a package with a new marzipan pig - one without any knowledge of love or loneliness. The mouse eats the new marzipan pig and falls asleep. The little boy who lives in the house opens the package (it is his birthday) and finds the mouse who escapes back into its hole. The boy tells his mother that he saw a mouse in a pink dress, though his mother never believes him. This time the mouse is not eaten by the owl but instead dances outside in the moonlight.

==Animated version==
The story has been adapted in an animated television film, produced and directed by [[Michael Sporn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sporn|first=Michael|title=Russell Hoban 1925-2011|url=http://www.michaelspornanimation.com/splog/?detectqt=false&amp;p=2862|website=www.michaelspornanimation.com |accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adaptation was animated by [[Tissa David]] and narrated by [[Tim Curry]]. It was aired on [[HBO]] as part of their ''[[HBO Storybook Musicals]]'' series.

'''''The Merchant of Venice''''' is a 16th-century play written by [[William Shakespeare]] in which a merchant in Venice (Antonio) must default on a large loan provided by a Jewish moneylender, [[Shylock]]. It is believed to have been written between 1596 and 1599. Though classified as a [[Shakespearean comedy|comedy]] in the [[First Folio]] and sharing certain aspects with Shakespeare's other [[romantic comedy|romantic comedies]], the play is  most remembered for its dramatic scenes, and it is best known for [[Shylock]] and the famous "Hath not a Jew eyes?" speech on humanity. Also notable is [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]]'s speech about "[[The quality of mercy (Shakespeare quote)|the quality of mercy]]". Critic [[Harold Bloom]] listed it among Shakespeare's great comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vftwsGjRSNMC|title=William Shakespeare: Comedies|page=1|editor-last=Bloom|editor-first=Harold|publisher=Infobase Publishing|date=2009|isbn=1604136316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot summary ==
[[File:Gilbert-Shylock.jpg|thumb|Gilbert's ''[[Shylock]] After the Trial'', an illustration to The ''Merchant of Venice''.]]
Bassanio, a young [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] of noble rank, wishes to woo the beautiful and wealthy heiress [[Portia (Merchant of Venice)|Portia]] of Belmont. Having squandered his estate, he needs 3,000 [[ducats]] to subsidise his expenditures as a suitor. Bassanio approaches his friend [[Antonio (Merchant of Venice)|Antonio]], a wealthy merchant of Venice who has previously and repeatedly bailed him out. Antonio agrees, but since he is cash-poor – his ships and merchandise are busy at sea to [[Tripoli]]s, [[the Indies]], [[New Spain|Mexico]] and [[England]] – he promises to cover a bond if Bassanio can find a lender, so Bassanio turns to the Jewish moneylender Shylock and names Antonio as the loan's guarantor.

Antonio has already antagonized Shylock through his outspoken [[antisemitism]] and because Antonio's habit of lending money without interest forces Shylock to charge lower rates.  Shylock is at first reluctant to grant the loan, citing abuse he has suffered at Antonio's hand. He finally agrees to lend the sum to Bassanio without interest upon one condition: if Antonio is unable to repay it at the specified date, Shylock may take a [[pound (mass)|pound]] of Antonio's flesh. Bassanio does not want Antonio to accept such a risky condition; Antonio is surprised by what he sees as the moneylender's generosity (no "usance" – interest – is asked for), and he signs the contract. With money at hand, Bassanio leaves for Belmont with his friend Gratiano, who has asked to accompany him. Gratiano is a likeable young man, but he is often flippant, overly talkative, and tactless. Bassanio warns his companion to exercise self-control, and the two leave for Belmont.

Meanwhile, in Belmont, Portia is awash with suitors. Her father left a [[Will and testament|will]] stipulating each of her suitors must choose correctly from one of three caskets – made of gold, silver and lead respectively. Whoever picks the right casket wins Portia's hand. The first suitor, the Prince of Morocco, chooses the gold casket, interpreting its slogan, "Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire", as referring to Portia. The second suitor, the conceited Prince of Arragon, chooses the silver casket, which proclaims, "Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves", as he believes he is full of merit. Both suitors leave empty-handed, having rejected the lead casket because of the baseness of its material and the uninviting nature of its slogan, "Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath". The last suitor is Bassanio, whom Portia wishes to succeed, having met him before. As Bassanio ponders his choice, members of Portia's household sing a song that says that "fancy" (not true love) is "engend'red in the eyes, / With gazing fed";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-navigators.com/merchant/MerchantText32.html#67|title=The Merchant of Venice: Act 3, Scene 2|website=www.shakespeare-navigators.com|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bassanio chooses the lead casket and wins Portia's hand.

[[File:Shakespeare's Heroines - Jessica.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of Jessica, from ''The Graphic Gallery of Shakespeare's Heroines'']]
At Venice, Antonio's ships are reported lost at sea, so the merchant cannot repay the bond. Shylock has become more determined to exact revenge from Christians because his daughter Jessica eloped with the Christian Lorenzo and converted. She took a substantial amount of Shylock's wealth with her, as well as a turquoise ring which Shylock had been given by his late wife, Leah. Shylock has Antonio brought before court.

At Belmont, Bassanio receives a letter telling him that Antonio has been unable to repay the loan from Shylock. Portia and Bassanio marry, as do Gratiano and Portia's handmaid Nerissa. Bassanio and Gratiano leave for [[Venice]], with money from Portia, to save Antonio's life by offering the money to Shylock. Unknown to Bassanio and Gratiano, Portia sent her servant, Balthazar, to seek the counsel of Portia's cousin, Bellario, a lawyer, at [[Padua]].

The climax of the play takes place in the court of the [[Doges of Venice|Duke of Venice]]. Shylock refuses Bassanio's offer of 6,000 ducats, twice the amount of the loan. He demands his pound of flesh from Antonio. The Duke, wishing to save Antonio but unable to nullify a contract, refers the case to a visitor. He identifies himself as Balthasar, a young male "doctor of the law", bearing a letter of recommendation to the Duke from the learned lawyer Bellario. The doctor is Portia in disguise, and the law clerk who accompanies her is Nerissa, also disguised as a man. As Balthasar, Portia repeatedly asks Shylock to show mercy in a [[The quality of mercy (Shakespeare quote)|famous speech]], advising him that mercy "is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes" (IV, i, 185). However, Shylock adamantly refuses any compensations and insists on the pound of flesh.

As the court grants Shylock his bond and Antonio prepares for Shylock's knife, Portia deftly appropriates Shylock's argument for "specific performance". She says that the contract allows Shylock to remove only the ''flesh'', not the "blood", of Antonio (see [[Quibble (plot device)|quibble]]). Thus, if Shylock were to shed any drop of Antonio's blood, his "lands and goods" would be forfeited under Venetian laws. She tells him that he must cut precisely one pound of flesh, no more, no less; she advises him that "if the scale do turn, But in the estimation of a hair, Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate."

Defeated, Shylock concedes to accepting Bassanio's offer of money for the defaulted bond, first his offer to pay "the bond thrice", which Portia rebuffs, telling him to take his bond, and then merely the principal, which Portia also prevents him from doing on the ground that he has already refused it "in the open court". She cites a law under which Shylock, as a Jew and therefore an "alien", having attempted to take the life of a citizen, has forfeited his property, half to [[Venetian Republic|the government]] and half to Antonio, leaving his life at the mercy of the Duke. The Duke pardons Shylock's life. Antonio asks for his share "in use" until Shylock's death, when the principal will be given to Lorenzo and Jessica. At Antonio's request, the Duke grants remission of the state's half of forfeiture, but on the condition that Shylock convert to Christianity and bequeath his entire estate to Lorenzo and Jessica (IV,i).

Bassanio does not recognise his disguised wife, but offers to give a present to the supposed lawyer. First she declines, but after he insists, Portia requests his ring and Antonio's gloves. Antonio parts with his gloves without a second thought, but Bassanio gives the ring only after much persuasion from Antonio, as earlier in the play he promised his wife never to lose, sell or give it. Nerissa, as the lawyer's clerk, succeeds in likewise retrieving her ring from Gratiano, who does not see through her disguise.

At Belmont, Portia and Nerissa taunt and pretend to accuse their husbands before revealing they were really the lawyer and his clerk in disguise (V). After all the other characters make amends, Antonio learns from Portia that three of his ships were not stranded and have returned safely after all.

== Date and text ==

The date of composition for ''The Merchant of Venice'' is believed to be between 1596 and 1598. The play was mentioned by [[Francis Meres]] in 1598, so it must have been familiar on the stage by that date. The title page of the first edition in 1600 states that it had been performed "divers times" by that date. Salerino's reference to his ship the ''Andrew'' (I,i,27) is thought to be an allusion to the Spanish ship ''St. Andrew,'' captured by the English at [[Cádiz]] in 1596. A date of 1596–97 is considered consistent with the play's style.

The play was entered in the [[Stationers' Register|Register]] of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]], the method at that time of obtaining [[copyright]] for a new play, by [[James Roberts (printer)|James Roberts]] on 22 July 1598 under the title ''The Merchant of Venice'', otherwise called ''The Jew of Venice''. On 28 October 1600 Roberts transferred his right to the play to the stationer [[Thomas Heyes]]; Heyes published the first [[book size|quarto]] before the end of the year. It was printed again in 1619, as part of William Jaggard's so-called [[False Folio]]. (Afterward, Thomas Heyes' son and heir Laurence Heyes asked for and was granted a confirmation of his right to the play, on 8 July 1619.) The 1600 edition is generally regarded as being accurate and reliable. It is the basis of the text published in the 1623 [[First Folio]], which adds a number of stage directions, mainly musical cues.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Wells]] and Michael Dobson, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'' [[Oxford University Press]], 2001, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

=== Shylock and the antisemitism debate ===
The play is frequently staged today, but is potentially troubling to modern audiences because of its central themes, which can easily appear [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]]. Critics today still continue to argue over the play's stance on the Jews and Judaism.
[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Shylock e jessica.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Shylock and Jessica'' (1876) by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]].]]

==== Shylock as a villain ====
English society in the Elizabethan era has been described as "judeophobic".&lt;ref&gt;Philipe Burrin, ''Nazi Anti-Semitism: From Prejudice to Holocaust''. The New Press, 2005, p. 17. {{ISBN|1-56584-969-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of the Jews in England|English Jews]] had been [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled]] under [[King Edward I of England|Edward I]] in 1290 and were not permitted to return until 1656 under the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]]. In Venice and in some other places, Jews were required to wear a red hat at all times in public to make sure that they were easily identified, and had to live in a ghetto protected by Christian guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Venice.html|title=Venice, Italy Jewish History Tour|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=16 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakespeare's play may be seen as a continuation of this tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hales, John W. [https://archive.org/stream/englishhistorica09londuoft#page/652/mode/2up "Shakespeare and the Jews"], ''The English Review'', Vol. IX, 1894.&lt;/ref&gt; The title page of the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Quarto]] indicates that the play was sometimes known as ''The Jew of Venice'' in its day, which suggests that it was seen as similar to Marlowe's ''[[The Jew of Malta]]''. One interpretation of the play's structure is that Shakespeare meant to contrast the mercy of the main Christian characters with the vengefulness of a Jew, who lacks the religious [[divine grace|grace]] to comprehend mercy. Similarly, it is possible that Shakespeare meant Shylock's [[forced conversion]] to Christianity to be a "[[happy ending]]" for the character, as, to a Christian audience, it saves his soul and allows him to enter Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Gorman | last=Beauchamp | date=2011 | title=Shylock's Conversion | work=[[Humanitas]] | volume=24 | pages=55–92 | url=http://www.nhinet.org/beauchamp24-1.pdf | access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of what Shakespeare's [[authorial intent]] may have been, the play has been made use of by antisemites throughout the play's history. The [[Nazis]] used the usurious Shylock for their propaganda. Shortly after [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938, ''The Merchant of Venice'' was broadcast for propagandistic ends over the German airwaves. Productions of the play followed in [[Lübeck]] (1938), [[Berlin]] (1940), and elsewhere within the Nazi territory.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture by James Shapiro: "Shakespeare and the Jews".&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles called ''Observer'', first published in 1785, British playwright [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]] created a character named Abraham Abrahams, who is quoted as saying, "I verily believe the odious character of Shylock has brought little less persecution upon us, poor scattered sons of [[Abraham]], than the [[Inquisition]] itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Louis I.|title=Richard Cumberland: Critic and Friend of the Jews (Classic Reprint)|year=2012|publisher=Forgotten Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cumberland later wrote a successful play, ''[[The Jew]]'' (1794), in which his title character, [[The Jew|Sheva]], is portrayed sympathetically, as both a kindhearted and generous man. This was the first known attempt by a dramatist to reverse the negative stereotype that Shylock personified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Armin|first=Robert|title=Sheva, the Benevolent|year=2012|publisher=Moreclacke Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Stereotypes of Jews in literature|depiction of Jews in literature]] throughout the centuries bears the close imprint of Shylock. With slight variations much of English literature up until the 20th century depicts the Jew as "a monied, cruel, lecherous, avaricious outsider tolerated only because of his golden hoard".&lt;ref&gt;David Mirsky, "The Fictive Jew in the Literature of England 1890–1920", in the ''Samuel K. Mirsky Memorial Volume''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shylock as a sympathetic character ====
[[File:Portia and Shylock.jpg|thumb|right|''Shylock and Portia'' (1835) by [[Thomas Sully]].]]
Many modern readers  and theatregoers have read the play as a plea for tolerance, noting that Shylock is a sympathetic character. They cite as evidence that Shylock's "trial" at the end of the play is a mockery of justice, with Portia acting as a judge when she has no right to do so. The characters who berated Shylock for dishonesty resort to trickery in order to win. In addition, Shakespeare gives Shylock one of his most eloquent speeches:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''Salerio.'' Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his flesh. What's that good for?
''Shylock.'' To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me and hindered me half a million, laughed at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine enemies – and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction.&lt;/poem&gt;|Act III, scene I}}

It is difficult to know whether the sympathetic reading of Shylock is entirely due to changing sensibilities among readers—or whether Shakespeare, a writer who created complex, multi-faceted characters, deliberately intended this reading.

One of the reasons for this interpretation is that Shylock's painful status in Venetian society is emphasised. To some critics, Shylock's celebrated "Hath not a Jew eyes?" speech redeems him and even makes him into something of a tragic figure; in the speech, Shylock argues that he is no different from the Christian characters.&lt;ref&gt;Scott (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Detractors note that Shylock ends the speech with a tone of revenge: "if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?" Those who see the speech as sympathetic point out that Shylock says he learned the desire for revenge from the Christian characters: "If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I will better the instruction."

Even if Shakespeare did not intend the play to be read this way, the fact that it retains its power on stage for audiences who may perceive its central conflicts in radically different terms is an illustration of the subtlety of Shakespeare's characterisations.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2007), p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the trial Shylock represents what Elizabethan Christians believed to be the Jewish desire for "justice", contrasted with their obviously superior Christian value of mercy. The Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to love his enemies, although they themselves have failed in the past. Jewish critic [[Harold Bloom]] suggests that, although the play gives merit to both cases, the portraits are not even-handed: "Shylock's shrewd indictment of Christian hypocrisy delights us, but … Shakespeare’s intimations do not alleviate the savagery of his portrait of the Jew…"&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2007), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Buchel Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree as Shakespeare s Shylock.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as Shylock, painted by [[Charles Buchel]] (1895–1935).]]

=== Antonio, Bassanio ===
Antonio's unexplained depression – "In sooth I know not why I am so sad" – and utter devotion to Bassanio has led some critics to theorise that he is suffering from [[unrequited love]] for Bassanio and is depressed because Bassanio is coming to an age where he will marry a woman. In his plays and poetry Shakespeare often depicted strong male bonds of varying [[homosociality]], which has led some critics to infer that Bassanio returns Antonio's affections despite his obligation to marry:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Harold|authorlink=Harold Bloom|title=Interpretations: William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice|year=2010|publisher=Infobase|location=New York|isbn=978-1-60413-885-6|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;ANTONIO: Commend me to your honourable wife:
Tell her the process of Antonio's end,
Say how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.

BASSANIO: But life itself, my wife, and all the world
Are not with me esteemed above thy life;
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you. (IV,i)&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In his essay "Brothers and Others", published in ''The Dyer's Hand,'' [[W. H. Auden]] describes Antonio as "a man whose emotional life, though his conduct may be chaste, is concentrated upon a member of his own sex." Antonio's feelings for Bassanio are likened to a couplet from Shakespeare's ''Sonnets'': "But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,/ Mine be thy love, and my love's use their treasure." Antonio, says Auden, embodies the words on Portia's leaden casket: "Who chooseth me, must give and hazard all he hath." Antonio has taken this potentially fatal turn because he despairs, not only over the loss of Bassanio in marriage but also because Bassanio cannot requite what Antonio feels for him. Antonio's frustrated devotion is a form of idolatry: the right to live is yielded for the sake of the loved one. There is one other such idolator in the play: Shylock himself. "Shylock, however unintentionally, did, in fact, hazard all for the sake of destroying the enemy he hated, and Antonio, however unthinkingly he signed the bond, hazarded all to secure the happiness of the man he loved." Both Antonio and Shylock, agreeing to put Antonio's life at a forfeit, stand outside the normal bounds of society. There was, states Auden, a traditional "association of sodomy with usury", reaching back at least as far as [[Dante]], with which Shakespeare was likely familiar. (Auden sees the theme of [[usury]] in the play as a comment on human relations in a mercantile society.)

Other interpreters of the play regard Auden's conception of Antonio's sexual desire for Bassanio as questionable. Michael Radford, director of the 2004 film version starring [[Al Pacino]], explained that, although the film contains a scene where Antonio and Bassanio actually kiss, the friendship between the two is platonic, in line with the prevailing view of male friendship at the time. [[Jeremy Irons]], in an interview, concurs with the director's view and states that he did not "play Antonio as gay". [[Joseph Fiennes]], however, who plays Bassanio, encouraged a homoerotic interpretation and, in fact, surprised Irons with the kiss on set, which was filmed in one take. Fiennes defended his choice, saying "I would never invent something before doing my detective work in the text. If you look at the choice of language … you'll read very sensuous language. That's the key for me in the relationship. The great thing about Shakespeare and why he's so difficult to pin down is his ambiguity. He's not saying they're gay or they're straight, he's leaving it up to his actors. I feel there has to be a great love between the two characters … there's great attraction. I don't think they have slept together but that's for the audience to decide."&lt;ref&gt;Reuters.

== Performance history ==

The earliest performance of which a record has survived was held at the court of [[James I of England|King James]] in the spring of 1605, followed by a second performance a few days later, but there is no record of any further performances in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Boyce, ''Encyclopaedia of Shakespeare'', New York, Roundtable Press, 1990, p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1701, [[George Granville]] staged a successful adaptation, titled ''The Jew of Venice'', with [[Thomas Betterton]] as Bassanio. This version (which featured a [[masque]]) was popular, and was acted for the next forty years. Granville cut the clownish [[#Characters|Gobbos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warde|first1=Frederick|title=The Fools of Shakespeare; an interpretation of their wit, wisdom and personalities|date=1915|publisher=McBride, Nast &amp; Company|location=London|pages=103–120|url=http://www.shakespeare-online.com/plays/characters/merchantgobbo.html|accessdate=28 April 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/foolsshakespear00wardgoog|archivedate=2006-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in line with [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[decorum]]; he added a jail scene between Shylock and Antonio, and a more extended scene of toasting at a banquet scene. [[Thomas Doggett]] was Shylock, playing the role comically, perhaps even farcically. [[Nicholas Rowe (dramatist)|Rowe]] expressed doubts about this interpretation as early as 1709; Doggett's success in the role meant that later productions would feature the troupe clown as Shylock.

In 1741, [[Charles Macklin]] returned to the original text in a very successful production at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]], paving the way for [[Edmund Kean]] seventy years later (see below).&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Halliday, ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564–1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; pp. 261, 311–12. In 2004, the film was released.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Sullivan]] wrote [[incidental music]] for the play in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/venice/index.html Information about Sullivan's incidental music to the play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125144749/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/venice/index.html |date=25 November 2009 }} at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 31 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shylock on stage ===
{{See also|Shylock}}

Jewish actor [[Jacob Pavlovitch Adler|Jacob Adler]] and others report that the tradition of playing Shylock sympathetically began in the first half of the 19th century with [[Edmund Kean]],&lt;ref&gt;Adler erroneously dates this from 1847 (at which time Kean was already dead); the ''Cambridge Student Guide to The Merchant of Venice'' dates Kean's performance to a more likely 1814.&lt;/ref&gt; and that previously the role had been played "by a comedian as a repulsive [[clown]] or, alternatively, as a monster of unrelieved evil." Kean's Shylock established his reputation as an actor.&lt;ref&gt;Adler (1999), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Kean's time forward, all of the actors who have famously played the role, with the exception of [[Edwin Booth]], who played Shylock as a simple villain, have chosen a sympathetic approach to the character; even Booth's father, [[Junius Brutus Booth]], played the role sympathetically. [[Henry Irving]]'s portrayal of an aristocratic, proud Shylock (first seen at the Lyceum in 1879, with Portia played by [[Ellen Terry]]) has been called "the summit of his career".&lt;ref&gt;Wells and Dobson, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob Adler was the most notable of the early 20th century: Adler played the role in [[Yiddish theatre|Yiddish]]-language translation, first in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Yiddish Theater District]] in the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], and later on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], where, to great acclaim, he performed the role in [[Yiddish]] in an otherwise English-language production.&lt;ref&gt;Adler (1999), pp. 342–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kean and Irving presented a Shylock justified in wanting his [[revenge]]; Adler's Shylock evolved over the years he played the role, first as a stock Shakespearean villain, then as a man whose better nature was overcome by a desire for revenge, and finally as a man who operated not from revenge but from [[pride]]. In a 1902 interview with ''Theater'' magazine, Adler pointed out that Shylock is a wealthy man, "rich enough to forgo the interest on three thousand ducats" and that Antonio is "far from the chivalrous gentleman he is made to appear. He has insulted the Jew and spat on him, yet he comes with hypocritical politeness to borrow money of him." Shylock's fatal flaw is to depend on the law, but "would he not walk out of that courtroom head erect, the very apotheosis of defiant hatred and scorn?"&lt;ref&gt;Adler (1999), pp. 344–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern productions take further pains to show the sources of Shylock's thirst for vengeance. For instance, in the [[The Merchant of Venice (2004 film)|2004 film adaptation]] directed by [[Michael Radford]] and starring [[Al Pacino]] as Shylock, the film begins with text and a montage of how [[Venice Ghetto|Venetian Jews]] are cruelly abused by bigoted Christians. One of the last shots of the film also brings attention to the fact that, as a convert, Shylock would have been cast out of the Jewish community in Venice, no longer allowed to live in the ghetto. Another interpretation of Shylock and a vision of how "must he be acted" appears at the conclusion of the autobiography of [[Alexander Granach]], a noted Jewish stage and film actor in Weimar Germany (and later in Hollywood and on Broadway).&lt;ref&gt;Granach (1945; 2010), pp. 275–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Henry Wilson]]'s play ''Shylock's Revenge'', was first produced at the [[University of Hamburg]] in 1989, and follows the events in ''The Merchant of Venice''. In this play Shylock gets his wealth back and becomes a Jew again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.se/books?hl=sv&amp;id=1zMofz4P_8sC&amp;dq=%22David+Henry+Wilson%22+%22Shylock's+Revenge%22&amp;q=%22Shylock's+Revenge%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Shylock's+Revenge%22&amp;f=false|title=Shylock: A Legend and Its Legacy|first=John|last=Gross|date=4 January 1994|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=335|accessdate=20 September 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise sometimes quote and paraphrase Shakespeare, including ''The Merchant of Venice''.

One of the four short stories comprising [[Alan Isler]]'s ''The Bacon Fancier'' (1999) is also told from Shylock's point of view. In this story, Antonio was a converted Jew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/22/reviews/970622.22saynort.html|title=The Joy of Theft|website=archive.nytimes.com|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' is a 2002 film based on [[The Pianist (memoir)|a memoir]] by [[Władysław Szpilman]].

A '''Velvet Elvis''' is a [[painting]] of [[Elvis Presley]] on [[velvet]].  It typically represents a costumed torso of Elvis holding a [[microphone]], painted on [[black]] [[velvet]] (or velvet of some other dark color, such as [[navy blue]], [[red]] or [[purple]]). This iconic [[velvet painting]] is considered an archetypical example of [[kitsch]].

A brief history of black velvet paintings is presented by Pamela Liflander in ''Black Velvet Artist'', a booklet published by [[Running Press]], [[Philadelphia]] in 2003, and included in an art kit by the same name. Liflander also details the life of [[Edgar Leeteg]], "the father of American black velvet kitsch," whose "raucous and bawdy" life was previously captured by [[James Michener]] in ''[[Rascals in Paradise (book)|Rascals in Paradise]]'' (1957).

Velvet was a popular medium for artists on the streets of [[Tijuana]], reaching a height of popularity in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ojr.org/ojr/spike/1040196203.php|title=The Rise and Fall of Velvet Elvis|publisher=OJR|accessdate=2006-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6646">'''Vexillography''' is the art and practice of designing flags; it is allied with [[vexillology]], the scholarly study of flags, but is not synonymous with that discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Whitney. Flag Bulletin XL:202(2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  A person who designs flags is a vexillographer.

==Principles of flag design==
Flag designs exhibit a number of regularities, arising from a variety of practical concerns, historical circumstances, and cultural prescriptions that have shaped and continue to shape their evolution.

Vexillographers face the necessity for the design to be manufactured (and often [[Mass production|mass-produced]]) into or onto a piece of cloth, which will subsequently be hoisted aloft in the outdoors to represent an organization, individual, idea, or group. In this respect, flag design departs considerably from [[logo]] design: logos are predominantly still images suitable for reading off a page, screen, or billboard; while flags are alternately draped and fluttering images - visible from a variety of distances and angles (including the reverse). The prevalence of simple bold colors and shapes in flag design attests to these practical issues.

Flag design has a history, and new designs often refer back to previous designs, effectively quoting, elaborating, or commenting upon them. Families of current flags may derive from a few common ancestors - as in the cases of the [[Pan-African colours]], the [[Pan-Arab colors]], the [[Pan-Slavic colors]], the [[Nordic Cross flag]] and the [[Ottoman flag]].

Certain cultures prescribe the proper design of their own flags, through [[Heraldry|heraldic]] or other authoritative systems. Prescription may be based on religious principles: see, for example, [[Islamic flags]]. Vexillographers have begun to articulate design principles, such as those jointly published by the [[North American Vexillological Association]] and the [[Flag Institute]] in their ''Guiding Principles of Flag Design,''&lt;ref name="navaDesign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nava.org/flag-design/ |title=Flag Design |publisher=North American Vexillological Association / Association nord-américaine de vexillologie |accessdate=2016-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides the following basic principles:

# "When designing a flag remember that it will fly in the wind and is not just a rectangular design on paper - so think what the flag will look like when flying in a brisk breeze and when hanging down on a still day."
# "Simplicity is important in creating a design that is easy to recognize and simple to reproduce. Try re-drawing the design freehand to see whether an imperfect drawing of the flag can still be easily identified. Also try imagining it at a small size, such as a lapel pin, or when viewed from a distance, when small details will not be obvious."
# "A flag needs to be distinctive to stop it being mistaken for another. Compare it to neighboring and similar flags to check that they are not easily confused."
# "If you want a flag to remain popular for a long time, it should look as “timeless” as possible, to make it immune to changing fashions. Avoid using features in the design that will cause the flag to become dated or obsolete, e.g., a reference to farming could be timeless but depicting a particular style of tractor will date very quickly. Imagine the flag in a historic setting and in a very modern setting to check whether it would work in both."

'''Virgil Charles Aldrich''' (13 September 1903 in [[Narsinghpur]], [[British India|India]] – 28 May 1998 in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]]), was an American [[philosopher of art]], [[Philosophy of language|language]], and [[Philosophy of religion|religion]].

==Early life and education==
The son of Floyd Clement Aldrich and his wife Ann Hanley, Virgil Aldrich earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] in 1925. He studied at [[Oxford University]] in 1927 and then went on to earn a ''[[Diplôme d'Études Supérieures]] de Philosophie'' at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in 1928 before completing his [[Ph.D.]] at the [[University of California Berkeley]] in 1931. He married Louise Hafliger on 3 September 1927 and they had one son, David Virgil Aldrich.

==Academic career==
Aldrich's first academic appointment was his appointment as an [[professor|instructor]] in [[philosophy]] at [[Rice University]] in 1931 and Sterling Fellow at [[Yale University]] in 1931-32. Promoted to [[assistant professor]], he remained at Rice until 1942, when he was appointed visiting professor at [[Columbia University]] from 1942 to 1946. Appointed [[professor]] of philosophy at [[Kenyon College]] in 1946, he remained there until 1965, serving as visiting professor at [[Brown University]] in 1962-63. In 1965, he became professor of philosophy at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he remained until his retirement in 1972.  On his retirement, he moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], where he became an adjunct professor at the [[University of Utah]].

Aldrich served as Director of the [[Kyoto American Studies Institute]] in [[Japan]] and for short periods was visiting professor at [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Michigan]], and [[the University of Texas]].  He served as trustee and president of the [[American Society of Aesthetics]] and president of [[American Philosophical Association]].

=="Some Meanings of Vague" (1937)==

In his article "Some Meanings of Vague",&lt;ref&gt;''Analysis'', Vol. 4, No. 6 (Aug. 1937), pp. 89–95, Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Analysis Committee.&lt;/ref&gt; Aldrich puts forth a series of definitions of [[vagueness|vague]] objects and [[sensum]], and then argues that any empiricist must account for vague sensum every bit as much as clear sensum, without skirting the issue.  He takes there to be many kinds of vagueness—importantly, there is vagueness of symbols and vagueness of senses.  Here symbols are anything which is used to refer, including verbal words, signs, pictures, and more.  Vagueness regarding symbols can be the same as the vagueness which regards the senses.  There can, additionally, be vagueness of the practices surrounding the use of the symbol to refer.  These, he suggests, should be avoided.

'''''Water Lilies''''' (or '''''Nymphéas''''', {{IPA-fr|nɛ̃.fe.a|lang}}) is a [[Serial imagery|series]] of approximately 250 oil paintings by French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] [[Claude Monet]] (1840–1926). The paintings depict his [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|flower garden]] at [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|his home]] in [[Giverny]], and were the main focus of his artistic production during the last thirty years of his life. Many of the works were painted while Monet suffered from [[cataracts]].&lt;ref name=A&gt;"Monet, Claude." [[Grove Art Online]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smart|first1=Alastair|title=Why are Monet's water-lilies so popular?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/11167000/Why-are-Monets-water-lilies-so-popular.html|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Monet's long preference for producing and exhibiting a series of paintings related by subject and perspective began in 1889, with at least ten paintings done at the ''Valley of the Creuse'', which were shown at the Galerie Georges Petit.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Paul Hayes, ''Monet in the '90s: The Series Paintings'', 1989, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] in association with [[Yale University Press]], p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among his other famous series are his ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]''.

During the 1920s, the state of France built a pair of oval rooms at the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] as a permanent home for eight water lily [[mural]]s by Monet. The exhibit opened to the public on 16 May 1927, a few months after Monet's death.&lt;ref name="A"/&gt; Sixty water lily paintings from around the world were assembled for a special exhibition at the Musée de l'Orangerie in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Bell. "Paris sees Monet lilies in a new light." ''[[The Times]]''. 8 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings are on display at museums all over the world, including the [[Princeton University Art Museum]], [[Musée Marmottan Monet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marmottan.fr/fr/claude_monet-musee-2517 Claude Monet paintings] at the Marmottan&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search?ft=monet Water Lilies] at the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Art Institute of Chicago]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/artist/Monet%2C+Claude Water Lilies] at the Art Institute of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slam.org/emuseum/code/emuseum.asp?style=single&amp;currentrecord=1&amp;page=seealso&amp;profile=objects&amp;searchdesc=The%20Promenade%20with%20the%20Rail...&amp;searchstring=id/,/is/,/7056/,/false/,/true&amp;newvalues=1&amp;rawsearch=id/,/is/,/1930/,/false/,/true&amp;newstyle=single&amp;newprofile=objects&amp;newsearchdesc=Water%20Lilies&amp;newcurrentrecord=1&amp;module=objects Water Lilies] at the Saint Louis Art Museum,&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]] in Kansas City, Missouri,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nelson-atkins.org/art/CollectionDatabase.cfm?id=6650&amp;theme=euro Water Lilies], the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Carnegie Museum of Art]], the [[National Museum of Wales]], the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes]], the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1960.81 |title=Water Lilies (Agapanthus) |publisher=Cleveland Museum of Art |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Portland Art Museum]] and the [[Legion of Honor (museum)|Legion of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.famsf.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The paintings at auction==
On 19 June 2007, one of Monet's water lily paintings sold for £18.5 million at a [[Sotheby's]] auction in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalya Alberge. "Monet lilies make £18.5m but just miss world record." ''The Times''. 20 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 June 2008 another of his water lily paintings, ''[[Le Bassin Aux Nymphéas]]'', sold for almost £41 million at [[Christie's]] in [[London]], almost double the estimate of £18 to £24 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xmotu.com/laurahenrycollection/news_monet.html The Laura Henry Collection] "Monet masterpiece sells at auction for almost £41million" ''The Laura Henry Collection''. 25 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, it was announced that the 1906 ''Nymphéas'' work would be auctioned in [[London]] in June 2010. The painting had an estimated sale price of between £30 and £40 million.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10225556.stm|title=Monet water lily to be auctioned at Christie's|date=3 June 2010|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giovanna Bertazzoni, [[Christie's]] auction house director and head of impressionist and modern art, said, "Claude Monet's water-lily paintings are amongst the most recognised and celebrated works of the 20th Century and were hugely influential to many of the following generations of artists."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The sale took place on 23 June 2010 at the auction house and the painting attracted bids of up to £29 million, but it ultimately failed to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10396341.stm|title=Picasso reaches £34.7m in Christie's auction|date=24 June 2010|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 May 2014, one of the Water Lilies paintings was auctioned at Christie's, New York City for $27 million.[16]  This auction totaled $141 millon &lt;ref&gt;https://news.artnet.com/market/christies-141-million-impressionist-evening-sale-496091&lt;/ref&gt; with the Monet piece Le bassin aux nymphéas being auctioned for $27 million of this amount. 

In June of 2014, one of the Water Lilies, ''Nymphéas'', sold for $54 million USD at a Sotheby's auction in London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; This piece was auctioned to an anonymous buyer, but the piece went on to be part of the exhibition "Painting the Modern Garden: From Monet to Matisse" at the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Royal Academy of Arts, London, starting in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-monet-painting-auction-20140626-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The co-chairman of Sotheby's modern and impressionist art department, Helena Newman, claims that the result is at the top of the original estimated selling price. This price was between 34 and 51 million USD. 

While many of Monet’s masterpieces have sold, there are still an estimated 250 oil paintings from this series.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/claude-monet-water-lilies-sell-for-32m-in-second-highest-auction-sale-for-his-work-9558624.html&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is widely popular, with many of these pieces residing in exhibits that have yet to go to auction.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3656">[[Muhammad Iqbal]] also known as Allama Iqbal (1877–1938), was a Muslim philosopher, poet and politician of early 20th-century. He is particularly known in Indian sub-continent for his Urdu philosophical poetry. Iqbal became prominence since 1899, when he recited ''Nalay e Yatem'' at the annual meeting of [[Anjuman-e-Himayat-e-Islam]], [[Lahore]]. The poems he wrote up to 1905, imbibe patriotism that includes the ''[[Tarana-e-Hind]]'' (popularly known as ''[[Saare Jahan Se Achcha]]''). The ''[[Bang-e-Dara]]'' (1924) is a collection of Urdu poetry written in three distinct phases of Iqbals life, In his early work he also wrote on most of the Indian iconic personalities such as ''[[Rama Tirtha]]'', ''[[Guru Nanak]]'' and ''[[Rama]]''.&lt;ref name="Faiz"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treasury Of Urdu Poetry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYnxB4-pJRUC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=94–95|year=2009|publisher=Rajpal and sons
