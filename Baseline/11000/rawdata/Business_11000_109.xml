==Early years==
Belda was born in Morocco

==Business experience==
* Non executive Chairman of the board from April 2008 to June 2010
*Chief executive officer and Chairman of the board from January 2001 to April 2008
*President and Chief Executive Officer of Alcoa from May 1999 to January 2001
*President and Chief Operating Officer of Alcoa from 1997 to May 1999
*He served as Alcoa's Vice Chairman from 1995 to 1997
*Executive Vice President from 1994 to 1995;
*From 1979 to 1994, he was President of [[Alcoa Aluminio S.A.]] in Brazil, Alcoa's Brazilian affiliate

==Compensation==
While CEO of Alcoa in 2007, Alain J. P. Belda earned a total compensation of $25,931,201, which included a base salary of $1,457,500, a cash bonus of $1,000,000, stocks granted of $6,978,791, and options granted of $13,558,026.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equilar.com/CEO_Compensation/ALCOA_INC_Alain_J._P._Belda.php CEO Compensation for Alain J. P. Belda] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208210653/http://equilar.com/CEO_Compensation/ALCOA_INC_Alain_J._P._Belda.php |date=2009-02-08 }}, Equilar.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
On October 6, 2005, in the paper [[EXAME]] in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], there appeared an article by journalist [[Alexa Salomão]], where Belda was quoted as saying Alcoa was paying Brazilians twice as much for energy for the corporation's Brazilian [[aluminum smelter]]s, as it was paying [[Iceland]]'s state-run energy firm [[Landsvirkjun]]: "...the agreed price — 30 dollars per megawatt-hour — was far from ideal. In Iceland, the company pays half that." ([http://mar.anomy.net/files/2006/06/alcoa-frett.htm]) When this news reached Icelandic media, on June 7, 2006 ([http://eggin.blogdrive.com/archive/129.html], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060612204742/http://www.malbein.net/pallasgeir/?p=149]), the reaction was negative from environmentalists opposed to the already controversial [[Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant]], and others, as Icelandic citizens and other firms pay 8 times that.

[[Friðrik Sophusson]], the director of [[Landsvirkjun]], said the quoted price was ridiculous, the real price being somewhat higher. A [[New York City|New York]] spokesperson for Alcoa said Belda had been "inaccurate" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070930154655/http://ruv.is/heim/frettir/frett/store64/item73762/]) in the interview. An Icelandic social-democratic [[member of parliament]], [[Helgi Hjörvar]], who is on the board of [[Landsvirkjun]], challenged authorities to reveal the real price and thus "clear the air" surrounding the project—the dam and the smelter. No answer was ever received. Representatives of Alcoa finally apologized to [[Landsvirkjun]] for the slip-up, Salomão's article was removed from Alcoa's website.

==Other directorships==
[[Citigroup Inc.]] and [[DuPont|E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]] and    [[International Business Machines]]. Mr. Belda serves on the board of trustees of [[The Conference Board]], the world's leading business membership and research organization, and is a member of the board of trustees of the [[Brown University Corporation]].

&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Mangalibi Darcos 20040621.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Antoine Ghonda next to [[Xavier Darcos]] on June 21st 2004. (France Foreign Affairs Ministry. Photo F. Eberhardt)]] --&gt;
'''Antoine Ghonda Mangalibi''' (born February 19, 1965 in [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]]) was the foreign minister of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from June 30, 2003 until July 23, 2004.

Ghonda grew up in the Bas Congo province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was then known as Zaire. He did university studies in the United States, and earned a B.A. degree in International Relations from [[Florida International University]] in 1992.  From 1992 to 2000, he worked in his family's businesses, and developed a lucrative career in international trade.  He took a keen interest in politics during these years, but did not align himself politically during the late years of the [[Mobutu Sese Seko]] presidency, nor during the early part of the presidency of [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]].

In 2000, however, he plunged into politics, joining the [[Congolese Liberation Movement]], a rebel group led by [[Jean-Pierre Bemba]]. In 2003, the Congolese Liberation Movement made peace with the national government led by [[Joseph Kabila]] and joined a transitional government in which there were four vice-presidents, including two heading major rebel groups. Bemba became one of the vice-presidents and was given the power to appoint the foreign minister. Ghonda was given the post.

In July 2004 Bemba demanded that Ghonda be sacked, and President Kabila was forced to oblige. Although there was active speculation in Kinshasa's newspapers about the reasons for Bemba's demand, there was not a consensus, and several reasons were advanced. They included Ghonda's criticism of troops from [[Rwanda]] and [[Uganda]] operating on Congolese soil, Ghonda's friendship with Joseph Kabila, and the mentioning of Ghonda by [[George W. Bush]] as one of the three pillars of the new Congo, with Bemba not being mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monuc.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?ctl=Details&amp;tabid=1583&amp;mid=1561&amp;ItemID=2561|title=DRC Press Review for July 23, 2004|date=July 23, 2004|publisher=[[United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo|MONUC]]|accessdate=5 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430115539/http://monuc.unmissions.org/Default.aspx?ctl=Details&amp;tabid=1583&amp;mid=1561&amp;ItemID=2561|archivedate=30 April 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing the confidence of Bemba, however, Ghonda became more influential with President Kabila.  In the cabinet reshuffle of March 7, 2005, Ghonda was named as one of two roving ambassadors (ambassadeurs itinérants) for the Congolese President.&lt;ref&gt;Gauthier de Villiers, ''République démocratique du Congo:  De la guerre aux élections'' (Paris:  L'Harmattan, 2009), p.249&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 2006 legislative elections, Ghonda was elected to a seat in National Assembly, representing a district in Bas-Congo province whose main town is Kisantu.  The Foundation Antoine Ghonda in this town is a leading source of socio-economic development in the area.

The '''Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka''', or '''AATSL''', is a Sri Lankan qualification and professional body for vocational accountants which was launched as an initiative that came through the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka]] (CA Sri Lanka). AAT is a technician level qualification offering higher apprenticeships which entitles those who have completed the exams and obtained relevant supervised work experience to become an accountant.&lt;ref name=refone&gt;{{cite web|title= History - The Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka|url= http://www.aatsl.lk/about-us/profile.html|website= AATSL|publisher= AATSL|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The need for accounting technicians were emphasized in the master plan for Accountancy Education in Sri Lanka prepared by the [[Asian Development Bank]] Inception Mission in 1986 and following that AATSL was established in Dec. 1987 on the model of the [[Association of Accounting Technicians|Association of Accounting Technicians (UK)]] and subsequently AAT Ireland (called Institute of Accounting Technicians Ireland) was formed in April 1983.&lt;ref name=his&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.aatsl.lk/about-us/history.html|website=Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka|publisher=AATSL|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional Recognition ==

AAT Sri Lanka is registered under the Companies Act No 17 of 1982 and re-registered under the Companies Act No 7 of 2007, as a company limited by guarantee. Two years after its inception, the Institute was admitted to the Associate Membership of the [[International Federation of Accountants|International Federation of Accountants (IFAC)]] which is a key body for Accountants. AAT Sri Lanka also has the distinction of being the first Associate Member of the [[Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants|Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA)]], a leading network of accounting bodies in the region.

== Governing Council ==

AATSL is governed by a governing council which has the primary responsibility of presiding over the AATSL’s affairs and provide efficient governance for the benefit of all stakeholders. It has 16 non-executive autonomous members who are either elected by the members of the Association or nominated by various bodies or persons. All Council Members serve in an independent capacity and do not receive any remuneration for their services.&lt;ref name=refs&gt;{{cite web|title=Governing Council|url=http://www.aatsl.lk/about-us/governing-council.html|website=Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka|publisher=AATSL|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Qualifications ==

Accounting Technicians are Middle Level Professional Accountants immediately after obtaining the Associate Membership (MAAT). However, by gaining experience in the field of Accountancy they can reach to Senior Technician Level (SAT) and Fellow Technician Level (FMAAT), which are considered as well groomed Professional Accountants. One can add more value and recognition to this qualification by gaining qualifications in other Professional Accountancy bodies.

== AAT Business School ==

AAT Business School is a Strategic Business Unit (SBU) operating under the AATSL, committed towards enhancing competencies and recognition of those seeking individual development. It was officially inaugurated on 22 January 2014 by Mr. Warren Allen, the President of The International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) (2012–14). The AAT Business School offers programs which can be categorized into Information Technology, Management Development Program (MDP), Taxation, English language and People and Leadership Skills (PLS).&lt;ref name=biz&gt;{{cite web|title= About AAT Business School|url=http://www.aatsl.lk/aat-business-school/about-aat-business-school.html|website= Association of Accounting Technicians of Sri Lanka|publisher=AATSL|accessdate=22 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1452">'''Birel''' S.p.A. of [[Lissone]] (near [[Milan]], [[Italy]]) started building [[kart]]s in the late 1950s after many years as a [[bicycle]] manufacturer.

They have had numerous world champions over the years including Mike Wilson and Gianluca Beggio.

The book, "Birel: 40 Years of Karting", was published in 2003.

Birel is the manufacturer of the "Easykart" 60 cc Cadet (8–12 years), 100 cc Junior (12–16 years) and 125 cc Light and Heavy class (16+ years). Championships in these classes are held in 26 countries worldwide, including Italy, United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, Russia and many other European and South American countries. Birel stages Easykart "World Finals" each October, and 2011 marked the tenth year of the competitions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5633">The '''Business Council of Australia''' ('''BCA''') is an [[industry association]] that comprises the [[chief executive]]s of more than 100 of Australia's biggest [[corporation]]s. It was formed in 1983 by the merger of the Business Roundtable – a spin-off of the [[Committee for Economic Development of Australia]] – and the Australian Industry Development Association. The organisation is headquartered in [[Melbourne]] with offices in Sydney and Canberra.

Its stated reason for existence is to give the business community a greater voice in public policy debates about the direction of Australian society.

==Structure==
BCA members determine the work program and policy positions through their participation in policy committees, task forces and the BCA Board.

===Board===
The BCA Board oversees the work of the BCA Secretariat, committees and task forces, makes recommendations on issues concerning membership and committee and task force appointments, identifies and clarifies policy issues, and proposes the BCA policy agenda. 

Business Council of Australia Board members, as of April 2017, were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Our Board | publisher=Business Council of Australia | accessdate=2017-04-05 | url=http://www.bca.com.au/about-us/our-board | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213065650/http://www.bca.com.au/about-us/our-board# | archive-date=2014-02-13 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former presidents include [[Catherine Livingstone]], [[Tony Shepherd (businessman)|Tony Shepherd]], [[Michael Chaney]], [[Hugh Morgan (businessman)|Hugh Morgan]], [[Roderick Carnegie]] and [[Arvi Parbo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Previous BCA Presidents | accessdate=2017-04-05 | url=
http://www.bca.com.au/about-us/previous-bca-presidents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The secretariat includes policy directors, working together with the policy and research team, the communications team and the administrative support team.

==Policy==
The reform agenda of the BCA advocates the [[water privatisation|privatisation]] and [[commodification of water]] rights. While it backed the Labor Government's original emissions trading scheme proposed under [[Kevin Rudd]]'s leadership and negotiated with the Coalition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bca.com.au/Content/101466.aspx Australia’s Emissions Trading Scheme: An Opportunity]&lt;/ref&gt; it opposes the scheme agreed between Julia Gillard's Labor Government, Greens and Independents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/opinion/bca-slams-carbon-tax-and-urges-genuine-reform/story-e6frg9px-1226165295093 BCA slams carbon tax and urges genuine reform], ''The Australian'', 13 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The BCA has advocated higher pay for outstanding teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bca.com.au/Content/101292.aspx Education Overhaul Will Open Door of Opportunity]&lt;/ref&gt;

The BCA lobbies the [[Australian Government]] and the [[Council of Australian Governments]] to influence policy changes.

In June 2009, it called for taxes to be increased on consumer goods but halved for corporations. The council made the call in a submission, entitled ''Unrealised Gains'', to the [http://taxreview.treasury.gov.au/Content/Content.aspx?doc=html/home.htm Henry Tax Review]. It said the [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] should be increased from its current rate of 10 per cent; while corporate tax should be cut to 15 per cent, from its current rate of 30 per cent.&lt;ref name="Tax cut"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/15/2597970.htm Business Council pushes for GST increase ], ''Australian Broadcasting Corporation'', Retrieved 16 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilising the DW/BI system is the final step before business users can get access to the information. The first impression the business community gets is when introduced to the BI frontend drives. Because the acceptance from the users is important the deployment has to be thoughtfully planned to ensure that the DW/BI system can perform and is delivering the results it is designed to.
To ensure that the implementation can perform and deliver it has to be exposed to extensive end-to-end testing .&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Kimball|Kimball]] et al., ''The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit'', Second Edition. New York, Wiley, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-470-14977-5}}, 542&lt;/ref&gt; The process of testing is an ongoing activity along the development process, because defects that should be correct later in the lifecycle are difficult to find and are associated with exponentially increasing costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.information-management.com/issues/20070601/1086005-1.html?pg=1 Information Management: Strategies for Testing Data Warehouse Applications]&lt;/ref&gt; A way of securing that the testing is done through the development lifecycle is to follow a methodology.
Kimball prescribe that before adding the DW/BI system, it should have passed a mock test that will cover the following procedures;
 
* Testing procedures
* Data quality
* Operations process testing
* Performance testing
* Deployment testing
* User desktop readiness.

'''''Caesar''''' is a [[city-building game|city-building]] [[computer game]] where the player undertakes the role of a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Governor#Rome|governor]], building ancient Roman [[City|cities]].

Released in [[1992 in video gaming|1992]] on the [[Amiga]], ported the next year to [[Atari ST]], [[personal computer|PC]] and [[Macintosh]], the game was similar to ''[[SimCity (1989 video game)|SimCity]]''. In addition to similar [[graphics]] and [[user interface]]s, it also came with issues of [[micromanagement (computer gaming)|micromanagement]], including complicated city-planning requirements such as building the right number of schools, theaters, libraries, bathhouses, and other amenities, within suitable distances of residential areas.

== Differences from SimCity ==
Notable differences of ''Caesar'' from ''Sim City'' included:

* Addition of a military aspect to the game.
* Simulation with detailed historical city themes and structures.

In ''Caesar'' the player was required to organize and fund armed campaigns against barbarians, and budget accordingly. The battles themselves were not featured in the original game, but the player needed to accommodate expenses such as travelling troops, billeting and provisions, as well as maintaining a road network to transport legions more effectively. ''SimCity'' eventually offered historical city graphics to overlay its game engine but the underlying user interface and growth simulation remained unchanged.

== Sequels ==
''Caesar'' was developed and designed by [[Impressions Games]] and distributed by [[Sierra Entertainment]]. Impressions developed another Roman-themed game at the same time as ''Caesar'', ''[[Cohort 2]]'', a game which allowed the player to direct Ancient Roman battles in a style akin to a crude precursor of the ''[[Command &amp; Conquer]]'' series. Impressions included a feature in ''Cohort 2'' which allowed players of ''Caesar'' to load their saved files and play out the battles from ''Caesar'' in ''Cohort 2''. Later, Impressions released an updated version of ''Caesar'' which automatically launched a version of ''Cohort 2'' whenever the player engaged in battle. This version was released under the title ''Caesar Deluxe'' in [[1994 in video gaming|1993]].

Impressions released additional sequels ''[[Caesar II]]'' in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]] and ''[[Caesar III]]'' in [[1998 in video gaming|1998]]. A third sequel, ''[[Caesar IV]]'', was announced August 2005 by [[Tilted Mill Entertainment]] and was subsequently released on September 26, 2006.

==Reception==
According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of ''Caesar'' and ''Caesar II'' surpassed 400,000 units by the end of March 1996.&lt;ref name=sierrasales&gt;{{cite report | date = March 31, 1996 | title = Sierra On-Line Form 10-K |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180416004925/https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/724991/0000891020-96-000721.txt | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/724991/0000891020-96-000721.txt | archivedate=April 16, 2018 | location=[[Bellevue, Washington]] | pages=7-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' in June 1993 recommended ''Caesar'' to ''SimCity'' fans who "wished for more buttons to push, knobs to adjust and wires to reroute". The magazine concluded that "''Caesar'' provides that rare quality in strategy gaming — an experience whose rewards prove equal to its challenges ... [it] provides the serious player with a real lion's feast".&lt;ref name="greenberg199306"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=107 | title=Impressions' Caesar | work=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1993 | accessdate=7 July 2014 | author=Greenberg, Allen L. | pages=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of pre 20th-century strategy games in the issue gave the game three-plus stars out of five, calling it "More of a game than a simulation, but it can be fun".&lt;ref name="brooks199306"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&amp;pub=2&amp;id=107 | title=An Annotated Listing of Pre-20th Century Wargames | work=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1993 | accessdate=7 July 2014 | author=Brooks, M. Evan | pages=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Caesar'' and its [[Caesar II|sequel]] were named, collectively, the 96th best computer game ever by ''PC Gamer UK'' in 1997. The editors wrote, "Impressions keep on keeping on with the likes of ''Lords of the Realm'' [...] but have never managed to regain the dizzy peak they climbed with their handsome brace of think-'em-ups."&lt;ref name=pcgameruktop100&gt;{{cite journal | author=Flynn, James; Owen, Steve; Pierce, Matthew; Davis, Jonathan; Longhurst, Richard | journal=[[PC Gamer UK]] | title=The ''PC Gamer'' Top 100 |date=July 1997 | issue=45 | pages=51-83 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Zone''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: Zona Central de São Paulo) is an [[Subdivisions of the City of São Paulo#Administrative Zones|administrative zone]] of the city of [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].

One of the largest [[Commercial district|commercial]] and [[Business district|business]] districts in [[South America]], the region is administered by the [[subprefecture of Sé]]. It is not concurrent, although often confused, with the regions known as ''Centro Expandido'' ("Expanded Center"), a broader area used by the city government for urban planning and [[road space rationing]] actions and ''Centro Histórico de São Paulo'' ("São Paulo Historic Center"), which, as the name implies, includes only the oldest part of the central region.

== Limits ==

Officially, the central area is bounded by districts of Municipality Cathedral. However, the social perception of what is called "center of São Paulo" varies and may include other areas of city. Until the creation of the administrative office of the Cathedral, the notion of "center" was equivalent to the region of the former administration regional office, who also included the districts of Brás and Pari,  currently covered by a Municipality of Mooca. The concept of a central area of São Paulo, however, is wider depending on the study is done about the region and may include items such as financial centers [[Paulista Avenue]] and Berrini.

=== Social Characteristics ===

According to the 2000 census, the total population of the area is 374,002 inhabitants, including the neighborhoods and districts of [[Sé (São Paulo)|Sé]] itself, [[Bela Vista]], [[Bom Retiro (São Paulo)|Bom Retiro]], [[Cambuci (São Paulo)|Cambuci]], [[Consolação (district of São Paulo)|Consolação]], Aclimação, [[Brás (district of São Paulo)|Brás]], [[Liberdade (district of São Paulo)|Liberdade]], [[República (São Paulo)|República]] and Santa Cecília. It is the least populated administrative region in the city, albeit one with a wider range of public facilities and jobs. The average income in the area is [[R$]]&amp;nbsp;2335.54, and each year the central area of [[São Paulo]] has a rate negative of [[population growth]] that reaches 5% per year, according to [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] and [[:pt:SEADE|SEADE]] statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/brasil/2008/01/24/periferia_de_sao_paulo_cresce_mais_que_o_centro_aponta_seade_1164511.html Outskirts of São Paulo grows more than the center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831210532/http://ultimosegundo.ig.com.br/brasil/2008/01/24/periferia_de_sao_paulo_cresce_mais_que_o_centro_aponta_seade_1164511.html |date=August 31, 2011 }} Retrieved on January 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.terra.com.br/brasil/interna/0,,OI2268177-EI8139,00.html São Paulo has drop in population growth] Retrieved on January 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

This factor contributed to what has been called degradation the region, as some experts in urban studies, with the removal of the São Paulo elite of the central areas, occurs along the removal of public stewardship, leading to a sense of abandonment.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Despite showing an average income higher than that of other regions of the city, it has many homeless individuals and pockets of poverty, such as the region known as ''[[Cracolândia]]'' (lit. "[[Crack cocaine|Crackland]]"), which has recently been undergoing a controversial process of revitalization by the city government, accused of promoting "social hygiene" through [[gentrification]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The ''Centro'' region is the most well-served by [[Transport in São Paulo|public transportation]], with four of the five [[São Paulo Metro|Metrô]] subway lines operating in the area, along with several [[CPTM]] commuter rail lines. It is also home to some of the major institutions of higher education in the city, as [[Mackenzie University]], The Armando Alvares Penteado Foundation (FAAP) and units of the [[University of São Paulo]] (USP), like Law School, The University Center on Maria Antonia Street, and the headquarters of the USP Post-Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Affairs.

=== Sightseeing ===

Torre Banespa ("[[Banco Banespa|Banespa]] Tower"), situated on the highest point of the [[Altino Arantes Building]] and [[Edifício Itália]] are the main sightseeing places in the region and [[São Paulo]] as a whole, providing a privileged views of the city with a range of up to 40 kilometers, making it possible to see other city landmarks such as the [[Mercado Municipal]], the [[São Paulo Cathedral]], [[Edifício Copan]] and even [[Serra da Cantareira]] at distance. [[Mirante do Vale]] Building, completed in 1960, although not well known as a sightseeing place due to its location at the bottom of a valley, is still the tallest building in Brazil.

[[File:Victoria 5.jpg|thumb|[[Victoria 5]] projector]]

'''Cinemeccanica''' is a [[motion picture]] equipment company specializing in [[Movie projector|cinema projectors]]. The company was formed in 1920 in [[Milano]], Italy. Currently they have two film projectors available, the [[Victoria 5]] (introduced in 1975) and the [[Victoria 8]] (introduced in 1961). A new digital projector, the [[CMC3 D2]] is also available.

The Victoria 8 at one time came in two models, a 35&amp;nbsp;mm film gauge and a dual 35/70&amp;nbsp;mm film gauge. The projector has become less popular in recent years with the smaller and cheaper Victoria 5 now the best selling projector from Cinemeccanica.

The company also manufacture film platter systems (the [[CNR-35N]]), film rewinders and [[Dolby Digital]] and [[Dolby SR|SR]] soundtrack readers.

The '''Consumer Credit Act 1974''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/39/contents c 39]) is an [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] that significantly reformed the law relating to [[consumer credit]] within the [[United Kingdom]].

Prior to the Consumer Credit Act, legislation covering consumer credit was slapdash and focused on particular areas rather than consumer credit as a whole, such as moneylenders and [[hire-purchase]] agreements. Following the report of the Crowther Committee in 1971 it was decided that wide-ranging reform of consumer credit law was needed, and a bill to do this was introduced to Parliament. Despite its progress through Parliament being disrupted by [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|a general election]], the bill passed quickly through the legislative process thanks to support from both the government and the opposition, coming into law on 31 July 1974.

The Act introduces new protection for consumers and new regulation for bodies trading in consumer credit and related industries. Such traders must have full licenses from the [[Office of Fair Trading]], which may be suspended or revoked in the event of irregularities. The Act also regulates what may be taken as [[Security (finance)|security]], limits the ways in which credit organisations can advertise and gives the [[county court]] the ability to intercede in the case of unfair or unjust credit agreements. It also gives additional rights to the debtor, including certain limited rights to cancel concluded agreements. The Act was amended by the [[Consumer Credit Act 2006]].

==Background==

===Early evolution of consumer protection===
[[Credit (finance)#Consumer credit|Consumer credit]] regulation was almost entirely ignored by both Parliament and the courts for over 800 years, with the judges and [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Members of Parliament]] taking the attitude that there was no reason to interfere with fairly concluded [[English contract law|contracts]]. The first piece of legislation to deal with consumer credit was the [[Bills of Sale Act 1854]], which required [[bill of sale|bills of sale]] to be registered. This allowed the courts to intervene for the first time, since an unregistered bill of sale was void and could not be claimed by creditors.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; This act was followed by the [[Bills of Sale Act 1878]] and the [[Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882]], which provided limited protection for debtors. Outside of these acts, however, little was done between 1854 and 1900, and moneylenders used this to their advantage, sometimes abusively; the report of the House of Commons Select Committee on Money-Lending in 1898 included testimony from one moneylender who admitted he charged 3,000% interest, while another had worked under 34 different aliases to avoid having notoriety associated with his name.&lt;ref name=g3&gt;Goode (1979) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this report the [[Moneylenders Act 1900]] was passed, which required registration for moneylenders and allowed the courts to dissolve "unfair" moneylending agreements. This act had two main weaknesses, however; firstly, many of the debtors who would like to sue their moneylender to have the agreement cancelled were by definition poor, and could not afford legal representation. Secondly, the Act only focused on specific types of lenders; lending by a single moneylender was covered, lending by a bank was not. In 1927 a [[Moneylenders Act 1927|second Moneylenders Act]] was passed, which required licensing as well as registration and forbade moneylenders from employing agents, canvasses or sending out unsolicited advertisements.&lt;ref name=g3/&gt; Unfortunately the 1900 and 1927 Acts also covered commercial transactions, and since people lending money in a commercial area were not excluded as banks were, a slight infraction could make a loan completely irrecoverable. This was partially solved with the passing of the [[Companies Act 1967]], which allowed the [[Board of Trade]] to give individual moneylenders licenses saying that they were acting as banks, not moneylenders.&lt;ref name=g4&gt;Goode (1979) p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the restrictions on business caused by the Moneylenders Act 1927, the idea of [[hire-purchase]] developed. These were first regulated by the [[Hire-Purchase and Small Debt (Scotland) Act 1932]], which only covered [[Scotland]]; England and Wales was first covered by the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1938]], later amended by the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1954]] and the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1964]]. The 1965 Act applied to all hire-purchase agreements worth less than £2,000 and when the hirer and buyer was not a corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowther Committee===
In 1965 the Crowther Committee was established to look at the state of consumer credit law in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Keenan (2005) p.420&lt;/ref&gt; Chaired by [[Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther|Lord Crowther]], the Committee began sitting in December that year and eventually extended their review to cover consumer credit generally rather than just the bills of sale and moneylending they had initially been concerned with, and their report was finally published in March 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; The report discussed the economical, social and legal aspects of consumer credit, and concluded that the existing law was so confused and unsatisfactory that it was not worth amending.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Instead it recommended the complete repeal of all existing legislation and its replacement with two new acts: a Lending and Security Act, which would regulate legitimate business transactions, and a Consumer Sale and Loan Act which would regulate consumer credit and establish a licensed system for its use.

The reaction to the report from consumer and business organisations was overwhelmingly positive, but the government initially did nothing, since the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] wanted time to work out the particular details of any Acts. Their hand was eventually forced by [[Norah Phillips, Baroness Phillips|Baroness Phillips]] a year later, who initiated a debate in the [[House of Lords]] on the matter. The government's official statement was that they were willing to accept almost all the recommendations made about consumer credit, they did not wish to legislate on lending and securities.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.7&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1973 they created a Voluntary Code which they expected those lending to observe. The Code set out guidelines for loaning money to individuals and disclosing the cost of the loan.

In September 1973 the government issued a [[white paper]] titled ''Reform of the Law on Consumer Credit'' in which they indicated they were planning to implement almost all of the Crowther Committee's consumer credit recommendations. The only real differences were an increase in the limits for financial protection from £2,000 to £5,000 (due to the drop in value of money), and stronger protection for hirers under hire-purchase agreements.&lt;ref name=g9&gt;Goode (1979) p.9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation of the Act==
The Act was first introduced to Parliament as the Consumer Credit Bill at the beginning of November 1973, and initially ran to 96 pages. It was given its [[second reading]] on 14 November,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1973/nov/14/consumer-credit-bill|title=CONSUMER CREDIT BILL (Hansard, 14 November 1973)|date=14 November 1973|publisher=[[Hansard]]|accessdate=2009-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was welcomed by both the government and opposition.By February 1974 it had passed through the [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Committee stage|Committee Stage]], but its progress was cut short by a [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|general election]] in the same month. Thanks to the support of the opposition to the original bill this did not make a significant impact, and the new administration immediately reintroduced the bill in the [[House of Lords]]. It was passed on 31 July 1974, and immediately received the [[Royal Assent]].&lt;ref name=g10&gt;Goode (1979) p.10&lt;/ref&gt; The final version of the act contained 193 sections and 5 schedules, much larger than the original 96 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisions of the Act==
The Act is divided into 12 sections, and is "designed to provide a comprehensive code regulating the consumer credit and consumer hire fgb and almost every aspect of a credit granting operation".&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part I: Director General of Fair Trading===
The office of Director General of Fair Trading was created by the [[Fair Trading Act 1973]], with the Director appointed by the government for a five-year term. Consumer credit was not originally part of his duties (although the scope of his role did contain some elements of consumer credit) and the [[Crowther Committee]] had recommended the creation of a separate Consumer Credit Commissioner, something included in the original bill. When the bill was resurrected after the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974]] general election, however, it was decided that the duties should instead be given to the Office of Fair Trading, and for this purpose a separate division (the Division of Consumer Credit) was set up within the OFT.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 1 of the Act gives the Director General of Fair Trading the duties of administering the licensing system set up by the Act, supervising the working and enforcement of the Act and any regulations made by it and, if appropriate, enforce the Act and regulations himself. The DGFT is also tasked with advising the government about social and commercial developments within the United Kingdom, and any actions taken to enforce the Act and its orders and regulations. Section 4 of the act requires him to disseminate any appropriate information and advice about consumer credit to the people of the United Kingdom. This allows him to educate the public about consumer credit, and was intended to be conducted through organisations such as the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]]. The Director's duties under this Act overlap slightly with those given by the Fair Trading Act, but are still an expansion over his original role.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.43&lt;/ref&gt; The Director General is tasked with issuing licenses, and under Section 35 of the Act, the Director is required to maintain a register containing all appropriate information related to licenses and applications for licenses. The register was created on 2 February 1976, and is kept at Chancery House in London.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.47&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Enterprise Act 2002]] formally substituted the Office of Fair Trading for the Director General of Fair Trading for the purposes of this Act.&lt;ref&gt;Enterprise Act 2002 S.278-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part II: Credit agreements, hire agreements and linked transactions===
Part II contains definitions for many types of agreements covered by the Act. There are three main types of agreement; regulated consumer credit agreements, regulated consumer hire agreements and partially regulated agreements.

====Regulated agreements====
A regulated consumer credit agreement is defined as an agreement between two parties, one of whom (the debtor) is an individual, and the other of whom (the creditor) is "any other person", in which the creditor provides the debtor with credit not exceeding £5,000 (this figure was subsequently increased to £25,000 and under the Consumer Credit Act 2006 there is no upper limit). An exception to this definition is so-called "exempt agreements", which are agreements made where the creditor is a land improvement company, a charity, a [[friendly society]], a trade union, an insurance company or "a body corporate named or specifically referred to in any public general Act".&lt;ref&gt;Consumer Credit Act 1974 S.16(1)&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "agreement" is given as any discussion which produces a legal relationship; a [[English contract law|contract]]. As such the decision of courts as to whether an agreement constituted an "agreement" under the Act rests with English contract law, and is not discussed within the Act. In many cases this is largely academic, however, since unless one party tries to contest the existence of a contract any agreement can proceed regardless of its validity under contract law.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

"Individual" is defined as including a partnership or other unincorporated body, but not corporations registered at [[Companies House]] or created by an [[Act of Parliament]] or [[Royal Charter]], such as the [[BBC]]. The definition also excludes "corporations sole", such as certain government ministers and bishops. Under the [[Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965]], [[industrial and provident society|industrial and provident societies]] are considered corporate bodies and thus excluded from the Act, but friendly societies and trade unions are unincorporated and thus qualify. In contrast, however, the definition of "person" includes both individuals and incorporated bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

A regulated consumer hire agreement is defined as an agreement between two bodies, one of whom (the hirer) is an individual, and the other of whom, (the owner) is a person, by which goods are loaned to the hirer for use without an option to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement must be "capable of subsisting" for longer than three months, not require the hirer to make payments of more than £5,000 total and not be an "exempt agreement". "Goods" are defined as [[Personal property|chattels personal]], with "capable of subsisting" simply meaning that the agreement does not restrict the time limit of use to less than three months. The agreement does not have to exceed three months, but the option to do so must be given by one party.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

====Partially regulated agreements====
Partially regulated agreements are those consumer hire or consumer credit agreements which are not an exempt agreement but are exempt from certain provisions of the Act. What these provisions are depends on the type of agreement; small agreements, non-commercial agreements and contracts with a foreign element.

Small agreements are defined in Section 17 of the act as regulated consumer credit agreements where the credit does not exceed £30 and regulated consumer hire agreements which do not require the hirer to pay more than £30 in fees. This does not include hire-purchase or conditional sale agreements, which do not qualify regardless of the size of credit, secure transactions and transactions where the parties have attempted to break up a transaction into multiple smaller ones worth under £30 to avoid regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.58&lt;/ref&gt;  Small agreements are exempt from almost all of Part V of the act, although they remain controlled by Part IV.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.59&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act is primarily aimed at commercial and professional traders, and as a result excludes non-commercial agreements. Non-commercial agreements are defined by the Act as agreements where neither the creditor nor debtor are providing the transaction for business purposes in any way. Non-commercial agreements are exempt from Part V of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

Contracts with a foreign element would not normally be mentioned in Acts of Parliament, which are deliberately constructed to avoid giving the law extraterritorial effect. In this case, however, the Act contains provisions for contracts with a foreign element, which due to the nature of commerce are common (a credit card issued in the United Kingdom, for example, which is used on holiday in France). As a result, Section 16(5) specifically excludes contracts "having a connection with a country outside the United Kingdom" from the Act.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part III: Licensing of credit and hire businesses===
The previous Acts on commercial credit provided no mechanism to regulate and enforce the rules, and the Consumer Credit Act's licensing system was the first major regulatory process within British consumer credit law. Licenses are required to carry out a consumer credit or consumer hire business, with exceptions for local authorities and corporate bodies allowed by an Act of Parliament to carry out consumer credit business. All other bodies must apply to the Consumer Credit Licensing Branch of the [[Office of Fair Trading]] for a license.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.106&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types of license====
There are two types of license given - group licenses and standard licenses.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

Group licenses are issued by the Director General of Fair Trading to cover a group of people in those activities described in the license. Group licenses can be issued following an application, or simply voluntarily by the Director. Holders of a group license do not have to apply individually and are not vetted individually, and holding a group license does not prevent members from also applying for a standard license. The group licenses are intended for cases where individual screening is not in the public interest; for example, when bodies are so large and established that their reputation is without question and individual screening would take too much time. Bodies currently holding group licenses include the [[Law Society of England and Wales]] and the [[Law Society of Northern Ireland]], both professional associations of [[solicitors]]. The Director has the ability to exclude named individuals from group licenses to prevent obvious abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard licenses are licenses issued by the Director General to an individual. It can only be provided following an application, not at the Director General's discretion like a group license, and covers certain activities in a fixed period. Initially there was no obligation to issue licenses, but an amendment to the bill in Parliament means that the Director General is required to issue a license on the application of any person, providing that person is a fit person to engage in such activities and the name he applies to be licensed under is not misleading or undesirable. The license allows an individual or a partnership to trade under those names listed on the license, and is divided into seven categories:
*Category A: Consumer credit business
*Category B: Consumer hire business
*Category C: Credit brokerage
*Category D: Debt-adjusting and counselling
*Category E: Debt-collecting
*Category F: Credit reference agencies

Holders of a license are obliged to inform the Director General when there is a change made within the office of a corporate licensee, an unincorporated body or a partnership. This must be done within 21 days of the change occurring. Details of new licenses are published in the ''Consumer Credit Bulletin'', the weekly journal of the [[Office of Fair Trading]].  A license lasts for 3 years beginning with the date specified on the license, not the date of its issue. A person who engages in activities that require a license when he does not have one commits a criminal offence. In addition, those agreements he makes are considered unenforceable unless the Director General directly intercedes.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

A license can be terminated on the death of the licensee, the licensee becoming bankrupt, the licensee becoming a patient under the [[Mental Health Act 1959]], a bankruptcy deal under the [[Bankruptcy Act 1914]] in which the license is given to a trustee or a deal under the [[Deeds of Arrangement Act 1914]] in which the licensee's license is handed to a trustee. Such provisions cover both individual, unincorporated bodies and partnerships who are license holders.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.119&lt;/ref&gt; These provisions do not cover corporate bodies, because following consultations the Government became aware that the liquidation and winding-up of a corporate body would pose problems with licensing, largely because the body continues to trade through a liquidator.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part IV: Seeking business===
The Act specifically controls the way in which traders and companies seek business. Prior to this individual aspects had been controlled — advertisement by moneylenders had been strictly regulated since the [[Moneylenders Act 1927]] — but no other aspects of consumer credit were regulated at all. While this was acceptable for large and respectable institutions, the evolution of less reputable trading organisations necessitated some kind of regulation, and the Consumer Credit Act was the first statute to provide such controls for consumer credit organisations. It covers three main areas: advertising, canvassing and quotations and the display of information. No regulations have yet been made on quotations or the display of information.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.140&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising====
The advertising provisions apply to any advertisement published for the business carried out by the advertiser which indicates he is willing to provide credit or provide goods to be hired. "advertisement" is taken to mean any form of advertisement, including a publication, television or radio broadcast, the display of signs, labels or goods, the distribution of samples, circulars, catalogues or price lists or the exhibition of picture, models or films, or in "any other way". Previous legislation such as the [[Advertisements (Hire-Purchase) Act 1967]] limited the definition of advertisement to visual advertisements and excluded oral communications and radio broadcasts, which are included by the Act. The test of whether an oral communication counts as an "advertisement" is whether or not the communication is made for drawing attention to the advertiser's business or for answering a specific enquiry without promoting the business. In ''[[R. v Delmayne]]'' [1970] 2 QB 170 the [[High Court of Justice]] decided that even replying to an enquiry can amount to an advertisement if framed in such a way that it is calculated to attract business.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

Part IV only applies to "public" advertising published to promote a business — as such circulars given to employees advertising such terms would not be considered "advertisements". Advertisements are not regulated by the Act if the advertiser is not involved in a consumer credit business, consumer hire business or a business in which he provides credit to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.142&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Part IV, the Secretary of State can make regulations limiting the form and content of advertisements covered by the Act. The regulations can also specifically include certain terms or facts, and failing to follow them constitutes an offence. The intent of these regulations is to ensure that no advertisement contains misleading information, that advertisements provide the reader with a "reasonable picture" of the terms and conditions and that the reader is aware that the availability and terms of credit may be affected by factors such as the age and employment of the applicant.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.144&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canvassing====
The Crowther Committee recommended that [[Peddler|doorstep canvassing]] for loans should be completely prohibited. The original provisions in the bill were indeed extremely stringent, and caused potential problems for other businesses, but were significantly amended and now only affect the canvassing they were intended to prevent. Canvassing is defined as a situation in which an individual (the canvasser) solicits the entry of another individual (the consumer) into an agreement based on his oral representations during a visit by the canvasser to "any place" for the purpose of making such representations. Exceptions to "any place" are places where business is carried out, either permanently or temporarily, by the creditor, owner, supplier, canvasser, employer of the canvasser or the consumer. There is no requirement that the oral solicitations take place in person - they can come over the telephone, or be trying to induce another individual to convince the consumer into entering an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part V: Entry into credit or hire agreements===
Part V of the Act deals with four elements of entering into a credit or hire agreement; pre-contract disclosure, the formalities of entry into a regulated agreement, cancellation of a regulated agreement and its consequences and withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement and its consequences. In some cases, specific information must be disclosed before a contract is made, with the standard provision that contracts where this is not followed are unenforceable without an order from the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.181&lt;/ref&gt;

====Formalities====
There are certain formalities for entry into a regulated agreement, mostly based on the documentation that must be provided. Under Section 60, the Secretary of State is required to make certain regulations covering the format that contracts must take. These regulations must ensure that the debtor is made aware of the rights and/or duties conferred on him by the agreement, the amount and rate of the total charge for credit, the protection and remedies available to him and "any other matters which, in the opinion of the secretary of state, it is desirable for him to know about in connection with the agreement". The Act allows the Director General of Fair Trading to waive certain requirements if it appears, on the application of a consumer credit business, that to enforce them would be impracticable.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 61 lays out the formalities required for a regulated agreement. The terms must be found in a signed and legible document, a copy of the unsigned agreement must be supplied to the debtor or hirer, a copy of the signed document must be supplied to the debtor or hirer and a notice advising the debtor or hirer of his rights of cancellation must be included with the signed and unsigned copies. The "signed and legible document" is described in Section 61 as a document which contains all the prescribed terms, other than implied terms, and is, when presented to the debtor or hirer for signature, in such a state that all its terms are legible. Such a document must be in the form "prescribed by regulations".&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.183&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulations in question are the 1983 Regulations (UK Parliament SIs 1980-1989/1983/1551-1600/Consumer Credit (Agreements) Regulations 1983 (SI 1983/1553) 1983 No 1553 "Consumer Credit (Agreements) Regulations 1983"). These regulations laid down specific rules regarding certain "prescribed terms". For example, a regulated credit agreement had to contain prescribed information about the amount of credit, the length of any fixed term loan, the amount of monthly repayments and so on. If a lender failed to comply with the prescribed regulations then the agreement would not be "properly executed" under section 61 and could then be challenged as "irredeemably unenforceable" under section 127.

====Withdrawals====
Part V contains several provisions relating to the cancellation of a regulated agreement and the withdrawal from a prospective regulated agreement. These are similar to those found in the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1965]], but cover all consumer credit and consumer hire agreements rather than the hire-purchase and instalment sale agreements previously covered. The withdrawal from a prospective agreement is found primarily at [[common law]]; a party may withdraw from a prospective agreement at any point before it becomes a contract without obligations. He can withdraw the prospective agreement by notice to the other party, with the Act allowing the creditor to use credit brokers as agents for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.190&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to cancel a confirmed agreement was introduced by the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1964]], mainly to frustrate doorstep salesmen who would take advantage of an unsuspecting person and force them to sign up to an agreement, normally with misrepresentations. In the Consumer Credit Act, the right of cancellation is covered in Section 67, which allows the debtor or hirer the right to cancel an agreement if there were false oral representations made to the debtor by somebody acting for the creditor. The cancellation may be enacted by serving a notice of writing given to the creditor or an agent of the creditor within six days of the agreement being made.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.202&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part VI: Matters arising during currency of credit or hire agreements===

===Part VII: Default and termination===

===Part VIII: Security===
The Act was the first attempt by the Government of the United Kingdom to provide coherent rules relating to the taking of [[Security (finance)|securities]] when dealing with consumer credit. Other than the Bills of Sale Acts there had been little law on securities before this, apart from a few provisions in the Hire-Purchase Acts. The Consumer Credit Act devoted an entire part of the Act to security, mostly between debtor and creditor, with third-party rights and regulations mostly governed by [[common law]]. The Act provides the form of securities, requires certain information and documents to be supplied, controls the enforcement of securities and provides certain circumstances in which securities can be considered void.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.260&lt;/ref&gt;

"Security" is defined by the Act to mean any form of [[Mortgage law|mortgage]], [[Bond (finance)|bond]], indemnity, guarantee or other right provided by the debtor as "security" to the consumer credit or hire-purchase agreement being conducted with the creditor. This covers both "real" securities such as mortgages and personal securities such as bonds. The only requirement is that the security must be given at the request of the debtor. Any security must be expressed in writing, and in some cases are part of the original hire agreement. This is distinct from previous law, which required a written note of the agreement but allowed the agreement to be conducted orally.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.261&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain other formalities must be observed; under Section 105, a security is not considered properly executed unless a document is signed on or on behalf of the debtor. This document must conform to certain regulations; the terms must be legible when it is presented to be signed, it must give all the terms and conditions other than implied terms, a copy must also be presented and if the security is provided before the regulated agreement is made, a copy of the security agreement must be given to the debtor within seven days of the regulated agreement being made.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.262&lt;/ref&gt; If the formalities are not complied with the security agreement becomes unenforceable without a court order.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.263&lt;/ref&gt; The Act does not provide for any civil or criminal sanctions for creditors who enforce the agreement without a court order, however, but it may lead to the revocation or suspension of the creditor's license.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part IX: Judicial control===
Part IX gives the courts wide powers to re-open credit deals deemed extortionate and gives them control over regulated agreements. Section 189 establishes that "courts" means the [[county court]]; all problems are to be brought to the county court, although certain situations relating to extortionate credit agreements can be sent to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]].&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.321&lt;/ref&gt;

====Orders====
[[File:Watford County Court.jpg|thumb|right|The County Court at Watford: the county court deals with the majority of judicial actions brought under the Act.]]
The courts are allowed to issue enforcement orders for cases where the contract has been infringed upon, except in situations where the contract has not been signed or the terms are not set out in the contract, in which case they are permanently unenforceable. The courts are also prohibited from making enforcement orders where the owner or creditor did not give a copy of the agreement to the debtor or hirer before the contract commenced. Other than this the court is obliged to issue such orders. There are also situations in which orders can be made even when there has been no infringement. These are when the debtor or hirer has died, to recover protected goods without the consent of a debtor and to enforce a land mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.323&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts can also make "time orders" providing for either payment by the debtor of any sum owed to the creditor, remedying any breach of the agreement by the debtor other than non-payment of money or both. These orders are made at the discretion of the courts after an application for an enforcement order.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.325&lt;/ref&gt; The time orders can also cover [[Bailment|statutory bailment]] in the case of hire-order or hire-purchase agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.326&lt;/ref&gt; If the court feels that the property in dispute or acting as security is at risk of damage or deprecation, they can give protection orders preventing the use of the property. This re-enacts Section 35 of the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1965]], which was repealed by the Consumer Credit Act.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.330&lt;/ref&gt;

Other orders are "special orders", covered by Section 133 of the Act. There are two types; return orders and transfer orders. Return orders are orders from the court requiring the return of goods covered by the agreement to the creditor. These orders may be immediate or subject to a delay, and may give the debtor the option to pay the goods value to the creditor if he does not return the goods in time. Transfer orders are orders transferring the creditor's ownership of certain goods to the debtor, ordering the payment of the rest of the goods to the creditor. This can only be done if the debtor pays an amount of money equal or more than one third of the value of the returned goods.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.332&lt;/ref&gt;

====Credit bargains====
The courts have long held [[Equity (law)|equitable]] jurisdiction to set aside "harsh and unconscionable bargains", but prior to the Consumer Credit Act this was mainly used in cases where uninformed tradespeople have been selling goods at a loss, and was rarely used in the 20th century. The [[Moneylenders Act 1900]] allowed the court to re-open a moneylending transaction if there was evidence that interest rates were "harsh and unconscionable or otherwise such that a court of equity would give relief", unless the moneylender could justify the rates. It was rarely used in the field of consumer credit because it was limited to those sorts of consumer transactions covered by the Moneylenders Act, and did not cover hire-purchase agreements or instalment sale agreements or loan transactions from people who were not moneylenders, such as banks.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.334&lt;/ref&gt;

The Consumer Credit Act provided guidelines for the court in determining whether a credit bargain is extortionate and extends the courts jurisdiction in this area to cover all credit agreements. If the court does believe the bargain was extortionate, it can re-open the agreement and examine the terms of it. If they decide it is indeed extortionate, they can set aside the remaining money owed, order the creditor to give money to the debtor, alter the terms of the agreement or order the return of any security.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.341&lt;/ref&gt; This only covers consumer credit agreements, not hire agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.335&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part X: Ancillary credit businesses===

====Definitions====
An ancillary credit business is defined in Section 145 of the Act as any business that works in [[credit broker]]age, debt adjusting, debt collecting, debt counselling or as a credit reference agency.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.346&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit brokers are people involved in negotiating deals between potential debtors looking for credit and creditors, normally in exchange for a commission. Under the Act, "credit broker" includes not only [[mortgage broker]]s and loan brokers but also car dealers, shops that introduce customers to financial houses for [[hire-purchase]] agreements and [[solicitor]]s who negotiate advances for non-corporate clients. An exception to this is if introductions and negotiations are not made in the individual's capacity as an employee of a business.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.347&lt;/ref&gt;

Debt adjusting is when a company or individual negotiates with the creditor or owner in an agreement on behalf of the debtor to change the terms for the discharge of the debt, takes over the debt in exchange for payment by the debtor or engages in "any similar activity concerned with the liquidation of a debt".Pieheads  This is again a wide area; the base definition covers, for example, solicitors and accountants who act as negotiators for clients who owe money to a third party. There are certain exceptions; a solicitor negotiating for the settlement of his client's debts is not considered to be working as a debt adjuster thanks to Section 146 of the Act, which excludes "a solicitor engaging in contentious business" as defined in the [[Solicitors Act 1957]].&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.348&lt;/ref&gt;

Debt counselling is the giving of advice to debtors or hirers about the liquidation of debts under consumer credit or consumer hire agreements. This covers any debt counsellor, regardless of if it is free legal advice; as a result the [[Citizens Advice Bureau]], for example, is considered a debt counsellor, although its advisers are covered by a group license. Debt collectors are covered by similar provisions, and are defined as anybody who takes steps to "procure payment of debts due" under consumer credit agreements and consumer hire agreements. Those who "purchase" debts and attempt to collect on them are covered by this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.349&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions for these definitions are provided under Section 146 if the credit broker, debt adjuster, debt counsellor or debt collector is the creditor or owner under the credit agreement, the supplier under the agreement, a credit broker who has acquired the business of the supplier or somebody expressly excluded from certain definitions, such as a [[solicitor]]. The provisions for suppliers only come into effect when the credit is a loan, so that the supplier and creditor are different people. The exceptions do not include people who "buy" the roles above by purchasing the debts, such as professional debt buyers or financial houses.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.350&lt;/ref&gt;

Credit reference agencies are covered separately from other ancillary credit businesses, and are defined in Section 148 as individuals or companies which carry on a business "comprising the furnishing of persons with information relevant to the financial standard of individuals, being information collected by the agency for that purpose". This definition was the subject of much academic debate, because the holding of the license for a credit reference agency involves a duty to supply information on credit status which the company might prefer to keep confidential. There are exceptions; the information must be collected for the purpose of giving it to others, so the fact that a bank, for example, has that information, does not mean they need to obtain a license as a credit reference agency.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.351&lt;/ref&gt;

====Licensing and other matters====
Part III of the Act applies directly to ancillary credit businesses, who must obtain a license. As with standard credit agreements, agreements made by an unlicensed ancillary trader are only enforceable against the other party if the Director General of Fair Trading issues an order which applies to the agreement. Under Section 149, creditors have an onus to make sure that the credit brokers they obtain business from are duly licensed. Again, if the broker is unlicensed, the agreement between the debtor and creditor is only enforceable when the Director General makes an order saying so. These provisions came into effect on 1 July 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.353&lt;/ref&gt;

Part IV of the Act also applies to ancillary credit businesses in relation to advertising, canvassing and quotations, as well as ways in which business can be sought. The Act also limited the brokerage fees that credit brokers can charge. Under Section 155, if the brokerage work does not lead to the client entering into an agreement with a creditor within 6 months of the work, the entire fee (minus the sum of £1) is refundable to the client. The Director General at the time indicated that those businesses which flouted Section 155 would be refused a license. These provisions came into force on 1 April 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Goode (1979) p.354&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part XI: Enforcement of Act===

===Part XII: Supplement===

==Implementation of the Act==
Some elements of the Act came into force on 31 July 1974, the day it was passed, but many were left to be brought in later at the discretion of the government. This process was "painfully slow", with almost nothing apart from the licensing system being active in 1979.&lt;ref name=g10/&gt; Section 141, which requires enforcement actions of a regulated credit or linked transaction to be pursued in the [[county court]], came into force on 19 May 1985 through the [[Statutory instrument (UK)|statutory instrument]] "Consumer Credit Act 1974 (Commencement No. 8) Order 1983".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=17 February 1988|title=LEGAL UPDATE - Consumer credit – Consumer Credit Act 1974 (practice note issued by the Queen's Bench Masters 21 January 1988)|journal=Law Society Gazette|volume=85|issue=38|issn=0262-1495|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/uk/legal/results/docview/docview.do?docLinkInd=true&amp;risb=21_T7549115139&amp;format=GNBFULL&amp;sort=PUBLISHED-DATE,D,H,$PSEUDOLOSK,A,H&amp;startDocNo=1&amp;resultsUrlKey=29_T7549115144&amp;cisb=22_T7549115143&amp;treeMax=true&amp;treeWidth=0&amp;csi=280335&amp;docNo=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act repealed the [[Hire-Purchase Act 1965]], the [[Advertisements (Hire Purchase) Act 1967]], the [[Moneylenders Act 1900]], the [[Moneylenders Act 1927]], the [[Pawnbrokers Act 1872]] and the [[Pawnbrokers Act 1960]]. The Act was influential outside the United Kingdom, and was studied in both the [[United States]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It formed the basis of a 1979 Directive on Consumer Credit of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=g10/&gt;

The Act did not go to the full extent suggested by the Crowther Committee's report, with protection only being available for consumers, not for the credit industry.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson (1975) p.436&lt;/ref&gt;
The Act was widely supported by all sides of the political spectrum, and by academia. Arthur Rogerson compared it to the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] in that, like the 1925 Act, it "represents fundamental rethinking of an area of great economic significance, which has resulted in the sweeping away of a chaos of obsolete rules, and the substitution for them of a simpler and better enforced body of law".&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson (1975) p.435&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''data pool''' is a [[Gateway (computer program)|Gateway]] to access the [[GDSN]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gs1.org/gdsn&lt;/ref&gt; Networks, where all necessary information to perform business transactions between trading partners is exchanged in a standardized way.

A data pool is the common point in the communication between the trading partners, provide synchronization capability of their data.  This information is accessible synchronized trading partners in a common, simple, fast and accurate manner.

The information exchanged in a typical data pools master data [[Global Trade Item Number]] and [[Global Location Number|GLN]], as well as other core attributes, necessary for the smooth transaction of goods. For example, product description, dimensions, packaging levels, product category, company address, minimum order volume, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gs1.fr/Publications/Publications/GDSN-Synchronisez-vos-processus-d-affaires&lt;/ref&gt;

Suppliers upload data to a data pool, which is pushed to synchronized retailers. This communication takes place under common rules and standards, with the consideration the business agreements between trading partners.

'''ELT''' is an alternative to [[extract, transform, load]] (ETL) used with [[data lake]] implementations.
In ELT models the data is not processed on entry to the data lake which enables faster loading times. But it does require sufficient processing within the data processing engine to carry out the transform on demand and return the results to the consumer in a timely manner.
Since the data is not processed on entry to the data lake the query and schema do not need to be defined a-priori (often the schema will be available during load since many data sources are extracts from databases or similar structured data systems and hence have an associated schema).

==History and Acquisitions==
Forensic Technologies International was founded in 1982 by two engineers, Joseph Reynolds and Daniel Luczak, to provide [[expert witness]]es for litigation and provide visual presentations to demonstrate complex technical issues for juries. Luczak later served as FTI's chairman from 1992 to 1998. The company went public in May 1996, raising $11.1 million and debuting at $8.50 a share. It was one of the first litigation support companies to be publicly traded.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1998/06/08/a-case-for-courtroom-presentations/dbff5862-2bcf-4dcc-8bde-e1b2da8bd4d8/|title=A CASE FOR COURTROOM PRESENTATIONS|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/2001/08/13/its-a-grand-time-to-be-a-workout-artist/49c5c577-e470-4aa3-babb-3e063d876283/|title=It's a Grand Time to Be a Workout Artist|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic Technologies International rebranded itself as FTI Consulting in 1998, and in 1999 began trading on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] as FCN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/41/FTI-Consulting-Inc.html|title=FTI Consulting, Inc. - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on FTI Consulting, Inc.|website=www.referenceforbusiness.com|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fticonsulting-emea.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fticonsulting-emea.com/en/about/our-history|title=Company History {{!}} Business Growth {{!}} FTI Consulting EMEA|website=www.fticonsulting-emea.com|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1998, FTI's business focused increasingly on "financial surgery on troubled companies, either through bankruptcy proceedings or in workout situations with creditors."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The company added over 1,000 employees to its Forensic and Litigation Consulting ("FLC") division since the passing of the 2002 [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]], which excluded auditors from providing consulting work to their public clients.

'''Francisco Seeber''' (November 15, 1841 &amp;ndash; December 13, 1913) was an Argentine military officer, businessman and [[Mayor of Buenos Aires]].

==Life and times==
Francisco Seeber was born in [[Buenos Aires]] to Sophia Taut and Magnus Seeber, both [[German Argentine]] immigrants.&lt;ref name=alcurnia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogiafamiliar.net/getperson.php?personID=I23414&amp;tree=BVCZ|title=Francisco Seeber Taut|publisher=Genealogía Familiar}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his studies in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], and returned in 1859. He joined the [[Argentine Army]], and fought in the [[Battle of Cepeda (1859)]] and as a Captain in the [[Paraguayan War]] in 1865 and 1866. Upon his return, he joined the editorial board of ''La Libertad'', and was elected to the [[Buenos Aires Province]] Legislature. He married Fanny Agrelo in 1868, and they had nine children.&lt;ref name=alcurnia/&gt;

Seeber established a construction firm, Catalinas Warehouses and Pier Company, Ltd., in 1872.&lt;ref name=nuevo&gt;Cutolo, Vicente. ''Nuevo Diccionario Biográfico Argentino''. Buenos Aires: Editorial Elche, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The firm obtained a municipal contract to construct the Catalina Docks (located along what later became the [[Catalinas Norte]] office park). Needing a large and steady supply of soil to level and grade the hitherto flood-prone site for the wharf, Seeber bought land in the then-desolate northwest end of the city with the intent of hauling soil to Catalinas for [[land reclamation]]. He recruited his workers mostly from [[Entre Ríos Province]]; they established a neighborhood ([[Villa Urquiza]]) there in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.clarin.com/elrincondevillaurquiza/2008/8/26/historia-villa-urquiza/ Historia de Villa Urquiza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109035415/http://blogs.clarin.com/elrincondevillaurquiza/2008/8/26/historia-villa-urquiza |date=2009-11-09 }} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeber was named President of the [[Buenos Aires Western Railway]] in 1887. He commissioned the construction of the important [[Rail transport in Argentina|rail link]] between [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] and [[Buenos Aires]]. He invested in the city's first large-scale [[department store]], ''[[Galerías Pacífico|Bon Marché]]'', and was appointed Mayor of [[Buenos Aires]] on May 10, 1889, by President [[Miguel Juárez Celman]].&lt;ref&gt;Rögind, William. ''Historia del Ferrocarril del Sud. 1861-1936''. Buenos Aires, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

He continued his immediate predecessors' emphasis on [[public works]], having 400 blocks of city streets paved, installing sanitation services in the impoverished [[La Boca]] district, establishing [[right-of-way (traffic)|right-of-way]] ordinances for the city's growing traffic, and initiating the development of what later became [[Florida Street]] (today Buenos Aires' best known [[pedestrianized street]]). He also approved plans for what, during the 1920s, became [[Diagonal Norte]] Avenue as part of larger (never realized) design for a series of diagonal avenues downtown. Another plan approved during his tenure ultimately became [[Nueve de Julio Avenue]] in the 1930s, and his administration also began or completed the creation or improvement of numerous [[city park]]s and recreational and cultural sites, among them the [[Buenos Aires Zoo]] and the [[National Historical Museum (Argentina)|National Historical Museum]].&lt;ref name=nuevo/&gt;

The [[Panic of 1890]] led to Seeber's resignation on June 4, and on June 22, he traveled to [[Germany]]. He represented Argentina in the 1894 [[Universal Peace Congress]] in [[Antwerp]], where he was an early advocate for [[free trade]]. Seeber returned that year and took part in a commission to organize the nation's far-flung territories in [[Patagonia]] and the far north. Following an 1897 stay in Europe to study the organization of the [[Quartermaster]] Corps, he toured [[South America]] for an appreciation of prevailing conditions, about which he wrote in his 1903 survey, ''Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Uruguay, Perú, Bolivia y Paraguay: estudios comparativos''. Seeber, who also wrote numerous articles on his military studies in Europe, was named head of the Quartermaster's Advisory Board in Argentina.&lt;ref name=nuevo/&gt;

Francisco Seeber retired in Buenos Aires, and died there in 1913 at age 72.&lt;ref name=nuevo/&gt; He was interred in [[La Recoleta Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=alcurnia/&gt;

'''Frans Cornelis Adrianus van Anraat''' (born August 9, 1942 in [[Den Helder]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] war criminal and a businessman.  He sold raw materials for the production of [[chemical weapons]] to [[Iraq]] during the reign of [[Saddam Hussein]]. In December 2005, a court in [[The Hague]] convicted him of complicity in [[war crimes]] for his role in selling chemical weapons to Saddam's government. He was given a 15-year sentence.&lt;ref name="BBCHague"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4555000.stm Killing of Iraq Kurds 'genocide'] BBC News, 23 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the appeal court sentenced Van Anraat to 17 years in prison.

Van Anraat is the only Dutchman ever to appear on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|FBI's most wanted list]].&lt;ref name="NOSFBI"/&gt;

==Business in Iraq==
In the 1970s, Van Anraat worked at engineering companies in [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Singapore]] that were building chemical plants in Iraq. Having learned about the trade in chemicals, he founded his own company, "FCA Contractor", based in [[Bissone]], [[Switzerland]]. Starting in 1984, he supplied thousands of tons of chemicals to Iraq including the essential raw materials for producing [[mustard gas]] and [[nerve gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|title=Dutchman in Iraq genocide charges
|date=2005-03-18
|accessdate=
|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both gases were used during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], between 1980 and 1988, as well as during the [[Halabja poison gas attack]] the military carried out on Iraqi [[Kurds]], in 1988, which killed about 5,000 people. The attack was part of the [[Al-Anfal campaign]] of the Iraqi regime against Kurds in the north of the country.

==Arrest and trial==
After his arrest and release in Italy in 1989, Van Anraat fled to Iraq, where he lived for the next 14 years.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4358741.stm

|accessdate=2007-05-09
}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Saddam's regime fell in 2003, Van Anraat returned to the Netherlands. He was arrested on December 6, 2004 for complicity in war crimes and [[genocide]]. On December 23, 2005, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for complicity in war crimes, but the court decided the charges of complicity in genocide could not be substantiated.&lt;ref name="NOSFBI"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

The court also ruled that the killing of thousands of Kurds in Iraq in the 1980s was indeed an act of genocide.&lt;ref name="BBCHague"/&gt; In the 1948 [[Geneva Convention]], the definition of genocide is  "acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group". The Dutch court said that it was considered "legally and convincingly proven that the Kurdish population meets the requirement under the Genocide Conventions as an [[ethnic group]]. The court has no other conclusion than that these attacks were committed with the intent to destroy the Kurdish population of Iraq."

Both the public prosecutor and Van Anraat appealed the verdict. In May 2007, the appeal court sentenced Van Anraat to 17 years in prison. The charge for complicity in multiple war crimes explains the extra two years, but he was not found guilty for complicity in genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Informant for Dutch secret service==
Shortly after the arrest of Van Anraat, several Dutch newspapers reported that Van Anraat had been an informant for the Dutch [[secret service]], the [[AIVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Dutch press, Van Anraat received protection from the AIVD and was placed in a [[safehouse]] of the [[Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations]], in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">'''Hypernorms''' are a concept from [[Business ethics]] that applies to principles so fundamental that, by definition, they serve to evaluate lower-order [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], reaching to the root of what is [[Ethics|ethical]] for humanity.

They were first proposed [[Thomas Donaldson (professor)|Thomas Donaldson]] and Thomas W. Dunfee &lt;ref name=Dunfee&amp;Donaldson&gt;“When ethics travel: the promise and peril of global business ethics” by Thomas Donaldson and Thomas W. Dunfee, California Management Review, Summer 1999; 41, 4; ABI/INFORM Global pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt; as part of an integrative [[social contract]] model of business ethics.&lt;ref name=Mayer&amp;Cava&gt;Social Contract Theory and Gender Discrimination: Some Reflections on the Donaldson/Dunfee Model Don Mayer; Anita Cava Business Ethics Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 2, Social Contracts and Business Ethics. (Apr., 1995), pp. 257-270.&lt;/ref&gt;
Donaldson and Dunfee have described hypernorms as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"principles so fundamental that they constitute norms by which all others are to be judged. Hypernorms are discernible in a convergence of religious, political and philosophical thought. An "authentic norm" is one that is generated within a community's moral free space and which satisfies the requirements of terms 1 and 2 of the macrosocial contract. Authentic norms are based upon the attitudes and behaviors of the members of their source communities. A "legitimate norm" is an authentic norm that is compatible with hypernorms."&lt;ref name=ties&gt;Précis for Ties that Bind* Thomas Donaldson Thomas W.

'''INFOTAB''' (International Tobacco Information Center) was based in Brussels as the cigarette industry's international lobby organisation.  It developed through four main stages.

Initially the program to set up a joint lobby by the competing cigarette manufacturers was known by the code-name [[Operation Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/foz1aa00/pdf|title=Industry Documents Library|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/vix66b00/pdf|title=Industry Documents Library|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was formally set up in mid 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/cyg85a00/pdf|title=Industry Documents Library|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first actual organisation with staff was established by [[Mary Covington]] on loan from Philip Morris.  It functioned under the name ICOSI (International Committee on Smoking Issues),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/ppdl0012|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its main operating subcommitte was SAWP (Social Acceptability Working Party) which tried to find ways to make smoking more acceptable to non-smokers. An Australian ex-member of parliament, [[Julian Doyle]] was the main director at this stage.

ICOSI was transformed into INFOTAB in 1984 when they decided to fund and staff the organisation to attack the growing political moves against the tobacco industry with the European Community (based in Brussels), and the World Health Organisation (WHO) and International Labor Organisation (ILO) in Geneva. The WHO in particular had a highly active anti-smoking program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/tmnk0196|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main director of INFOTAB was the Australian newspaper executive Bryan C Simpson.

In the November 1998, the [[Master Settlement Agreement]] was signed between the Clinton Administration, the US States Attorneys General. and the tobacco industry. This agreement supposedly clamped down  on the underhand activities of the tobacco industry and so INFOTAB was supposed to disappear.  It didn't.

Many of the functions were simply passed over to the Tobacco Documentation Center which was by then a highly diffuse organisation with database operations in various countries, but based initially on the Brussels INFOTAB database division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu/tobacco/docs/stfd0204|title=Industry Documents Library|website=www.industrydocumentslibrary.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/pfe51a99/pdf|title=Industry Documents Library|website=legacy.library.ucsf.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kering S.A.''' ({{IPA-fr|kɛːʁiŋ|lang}}) is an international luxury group based in [[Paris]], [[France]]. It owns [[luxury goods]] brands, including [[Gucci]], [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]], [[Balenciaga]], [[Alexander McQueen (brand)|Alexander McQueen]], [[Bottega Veneta]], [[Boucheron]] and [[Brioni (fashion)|Brioni]], [[Pomellato]].

The company was founded in 1963. It was known as '''Pinault S.A.''' until 1994, as '''Pinault-Printemps-Redoute''' from 1994 to 2005, as '''PPR''' from 2005 to 2013, and became Kering in 2013. It has been quoted on [[Euronext Paris]] since 1988 and has been a constituent of the [[CAC 40]] index since 1995. The company has been headed by [[François-Henri Pinault]] since 2005.

== History ==
=== Building a retail empire with wood ===
In 1963, with a loan from his family and a bank, [[François Pinault]] opened the ''Établissements Pinault'' in [[Brittany]] (France) and specialized in timber trading. The company grew organically and through successful acquisitions. In 1988, Pinault S.A. was listed on the [[Paris Stock Exchange]], multiplying the group’s financial power.

In 1989, it purchased 20% of [[CFAO]], a French distribution conglomerate active throughout [[Africa]]. In 1990, Pinault S.A. and CFAO merged, and François Pinault became head of the newly formed group. This accelerated its acquisitions in the retail sector: [[Conforama]] (French furniture retailer) in 1991, [[Printemps]] (department stores in Paris) in 1992, which also owned 54% of [[La Redoute]] (French mail-order shopping retailer), and [[Fnac]] (French bookstore, multimedia and electronics retailer) in 1994. To align the group’s identity with its new activities, it was renamed Pinault-Printemps-Redoute (PPR) in 1994.

=== Offloading retail assets to invest in luxury ===
[[File:PPR SA.svg|thumb|right|Former logo of the company, when it was known as PPR (Pinault-Printemps-Redoute)]]
In 1999, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute purchased a controlling 42% stake of the [[Gucci group]] for $3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/05/27/europe/gucci/|title=Gucci fades on court ruling|website=Cnn.com|date=27 May 1999|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the Gucci deal, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute also acquired the brand [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/mar/20/business/fi-19096|title=Gucci Group Agrees to Sell 40% Stake to French Retailer|website=Latimes.com|date=20 March 1999|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1999/11/16/gucci-to-buy-parent-of-yves-saint-laurent/1971b749-2e0c-448f-86b3-57dd492b6999/|title=Gucci to Buy Parent Of Yves Saint Laurent|website=Washingtonpost.com|date=16 November 1999|author=Sri Ramakrishnan|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It confirmed this new strategy with its following acquisitions, which included the French high-jewelry house [[Boucheron]] (2000), the Italian leather goods maker [[Bottega Veneta]], and the fashion house [[Balenciaga]] (2001). In 2001, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute also signed strategic partnerships with ex-[[Givenchy]] fashion designer [[Alexander McQueen]] and with [[Stella McCartney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McNeil |first1=Peter |last2=Riello |first2=Giorgio |date=19 May 2016 |title=Luxury: A Rich History |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EsowDAAAQBAJ |language= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191640278|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a new strategy for the group, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute offloaded its assets in the retail sector one after the other: Pinault Bois et Matériaux, upon which the whole group developed and grew, was acquired in 2003 by the British group [[Wolseley plc|Wolseley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citywire.co.uk/money/ooh-la-la-wolseley-gets-heavy-in-france/a247731|title=Ooh la la, Wolseley gets heavy in France|website=Citywire.co.uk|date=24 April 2003|author=Joanne Wallen|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, François Pinault handed over the helm of [[Groupe Artémis|Artémis]], the family holding company that controlled Pinault-Printemps-Redoute and other assets ([[Château Latour]], [[Christie’s]], etc.), to his son François-Henri. In 2004, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute acquired almost all of the remaining shares of the [[Gucci group]] to reach a 99.4% ownership of the Italian luxury company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2004/03/23/ppr-moves-to-buy-last-30-of-gucci-group/|title=PPR moves to buy last 30% of Gucci Group|website=Nypost.com|date=23 March 2004|author=Suzanne Kapner|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, François-Henri Pinault chose a hands-on approach to managing Pinault-Printemps-Redoute and decided to take over the position of CEO.&lt;ref name="nyt curtain"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/t-magazine/the-man-behind-the-curtain.html|title=The Man Behind the Curtain|website=Nytimes.com|date=15 February 2013|author=Joshua Levine|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group officially changed its name to PPR.

The divestment of the group’s retail assets continued: Le Printemps (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/20/business/worldbusiness/20iht-ppr.html|title=As sales fall, PPR works to unload Printemps|website=Nytimes.com|date=20 June 2006|author=Sara Gay Forden, Jacqueline Simmons|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conforama (2011), CFAO and Fnac (2012), and La Redoute (2013). In the meantime, PPR acquired the [[Sowind Group]] (owner of Swiss high-end watchmaker [[Girard-Perregaux]]) and the Italian bespoke tailor [[Brioni (fashion)|Brioni]] (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204190704577026011411533018|title=PPR Buys Menswear Brand Brioni|website=Wsj.com|date=8 November 2011|author=Christina Passariello|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Italian group [[Pomellato]] (Pomellato and Dodo jewelry brands),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwd.com/accessories-news/jewelry/kering-acquires-pomellato-6906980/|title=Kering Acquires Pomellato|website=Wwd.com|date=24 April 2013|author=Luisa Zargani, Miles Socha|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Chinese jeweler [[Qeelin]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fashionunited.com/executive/management/ppr-acquires-majority-stake-in-chinese-qeelin-20121112490803|title=PPR acquires majority stake in Chinese Qeelin|website=Fashiounited.com|date=9 December 2012|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fashion designer [[Christopher Kane]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/article/christopher-kane-bought-by-ppr-majority-stake-acquisition|title=PPR Buys Majority Stake In Christopher Kane|website=Vogue.co.uk|date=15 January 2013|author=Ella Alexander|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and luxury watch manufacturer [[Ulysse Nardin]] (2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethdoerr/2014/07/30/kering-previously-ppr-gucci-group-acquires-ulysse-nardin/|title=Kering (Previously PPR, Gucci Group) Acquires Ulysse Nardin|website=Forbes.com|date=30 July 2014|author=Elizabeth Doerr|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kering, a new luxury company===
[[File:Hôpital Laennec de Paris ext 1.JPG|thumb|right|The company's head office in [[Paris]] at 40 rue de Sèvres, formerly the [[:fr:Hôpital Laennec de Paris|Hôpital Laennec]]]]
On March 22, 2013, PPR changed its name to Kering in order to fully achieve the group’s shift towards luxury goods.  Pronounced {{IPA-fr|kɛːʁiŋ|}}, to sound like the English word "[[wikt:caring#English|caring]]", the new name is a reference to the Pinault family’s region of origin, [[Brittany]], where ''[[wikt:kêr#Breton|kêr]]'' means "home". The new logo has an [[owl]] as its emblem, a bird that can rotate its head 270 degrees, giving it extraordinary vision, and François Pinault’s favorite animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/business/global/ppr-to-show-breton-roots-with-rebranding-as-kering.html|title=PPR to Show Breton Roots With Rebranding as Kering|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes official"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonydemarco/2013/06/18/its-official-ppr-becomes-kering-reportedly-in-talks-to-acquire-richard-mille/|title=It's Official: PPR Becomes Kering; Reportedly In Talks To Acquire Richard Mille|website=Forbes.com|date=18 June 2013|author=Anthony DeMarco|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, [[Alessandro Michele]], an unknown accessories designer, was named creative director of Gucci, and quickly revitalized the brand’s creativity, fashion relevance, and profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d9f408e1-8022-32c3-b3d5-8b510da100ac|title=Kering reports strongest revenue growth since 2012|website=Ft.com|date=10 February 2017|author=Harriet Agnew|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg surge"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-26/kering-shares-surge-after-gucci-s-strongest-growth-in-20-years|title=Gucci's Latest Revival Fueled by Sequins Rather Than Sex|website=Bloomberg.com|date=26 April 2017|author=Robert William|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2014 to 2017, Gucci's sales doubled from 3,497.2 million euros to 6,211.2 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/bof-exclusive/bof-exclusive-marco-bizzarri-on-guccis-remarkable-turnaround|title=Marco Bizzarri on Gucci’s Remarkable Turnaround|website=Businessoffashion.com|date=27 October 2016|author=Limei Hoang|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, following [[Hedi Slimane]]’s four-year success at the creative helm of Yves Saint Laurent, Kering named a new creative director, [[Anthony Vaccarello]], to pursue the evolution of the brand while maintaining its growth pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashionista.com/2017/02/kering-sales-full-year-2016|title=10 months after Hedi Slimane's departure, Yves Saint Laurent is still Kering's big money-maker|website=Fashionista.com|date=10 February 2017|author=Maura Brannigan|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Kering named Georgian-born designer [[Demna Gvasalia]] as creative director of [[Balenciaga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/oct/02/demna-gvasalia-reinvigorates-balenciaga-with-strategic-disrespect|title=Demna Gvasalia reinvigorates Balenciaga with strategic disrespect|website=Theguardian.com|date=2 October 2016|author=Jess Cartner-Morley|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commitments ==
=== Sustainability ===
In April 2012, Kering committed to a 4-year plan aiming to significantly reducing its impact on the environment. The group defined a set of quantifiable targets covering both environmental and social issues, and developed the Environmental Profit &amp; Loss account (E P&amp;L) to measure its progress.&lt;ref name="bof report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/bof-exclusive/bof-exclusive-kering-goes-public-with-sustainability-report-revealing-progress-and-pain-points|title=Kering Goes Public with Sustainability Report, Revealing Progress and Pain Points|website=Businessoffashion.com|date=3 May 2016|author=Kate Abnett|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After publishing its 2016 sustainability report,&lt;ref name="bof report"/&gt; Kering announced its new sustainability program, targeting a 40% reduction of its global environmental impact by 2025, a strategy aligned with the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/fashion/franois-henri-pinault-kering-sustainability.html|title=François-Henri Pinault, Kering Chief, on Why Green Is the New Black|website=Nytimes.com|date=25 January 2017|author=Elizabeth Paton|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/business_models/libby_maccarthy/kering_transform_luxury_industry_next_gen_sustainable|title=Kering to Transform Luxury Industry with Next-Gen Sustainability Strategy|website=Sustainablebrands.com|date=26 January 2017|author=Libby MacCarthy|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Kering became part of the [[Dow Jones Sustainability Indices]] world and Europe, and was recognized as an industry leader in 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.fashionnetwork.com/news/Kering-still-industry-leader-in-Dow-Jones-Sustainability-Indices,572365.html|title=Kering still industry leader in Dow Jones Sustainability Indices|website=Fashionnetwork.com|date=17 September 2015|author=Monica Karski|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, during the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Kering was named top sustainable textile, apparel and luxury goods corporation in the [[The Global 100|Corporate Knights Global 100 index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/kering-most-sustainable-global-corporation-11122255/|title=Kering Named Most Sustainable Global Corporation|website=Wwd.com|date=23 January 2018|author=Lorelei Marfil |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, in partnership with the [[London College of Fashion]], Kering launched the first online class ([[Massive open online course|Mooc]]) in fashion and sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/a18278649/kering-launches-first-online-course-in-luxury-fashion-and-sustainability/|title=Kering launches first online course in luxury fashion and sustainability|website=Harpersbazaar.com|date=20 February 2018|author=Sarah Karmali|accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, Kering started to implement the use of the first 100% traceable organic cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.just-style.com/news/pioneering-partnership-on-traceable-organic-cotton-for-kering_id134742.aspx|title=Pioneering partnership on traceable organic cotton for Kering|last=Abdulla|first=Hannah|date=15 October 2018|work=Just-Style|access-date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kering Foundation===
{{main article|Kering Foundation}}
The Kering Foundation is committed to defending women’s dignity and rights by combating violence against women and promoting women’s empowerment. Since 2009, the Foundation initiated 47 partnerships with NGOs and supported many social projects oriented towards women’s rights.

Many brands have their own philanthropic projects with the support of the Kering Foundation. Gucci launched its project ''Chime for Change'', an international campaign to raise funds for women’s emancipation, focusing on education, health and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/28/chime-for-change-campaign-beyonce-help-girls-run-the-world_n_2784192.html |title=Chime For Change Campaign, Beyoncé Launch Initiative To Help Girls Run The World |publisher=huffingtonpost.com |date= 2013-01-03|accessdate=2013-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Tax evasion by Marco Bizzarri ===

In 2018 a network of international journalists, the European Investigative Collaborations (EIC), received leaked documents that provide insight into Kerings tax evasion strategies. The CEO of Gucci, Marco Bizzarri, by contract received a net salary of 8 million Euros. To pay as little tax as possible for this salary a special strategy was formed by Kering. That included a residence in Switzerland and two contracts for Bizzarri, one in Italy and one in Luxemburg. The salary was then paid by a shell corporation in Luxemburg. Using this strategy € 9,49 million gross gained Bizzarri € 8,04 net income.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/gucci-chef-marco-bizzarri-mogelte-millionengehalt-an-der-steuer-vorbei-a-1190037.html&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement Kering said that it's methods were within given laws.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kering-gucci-tax/kering-says-gucci-boss-tax-compliant-in-italy-after-report-idUSKBN1FF2SN&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible tax evasion ===
 
In November 2017 Italian authorities opened a criminal investigation into a tax case involving Kering and its flagship brand Gucci. The inquiry included a raid on Gucci offices in Florence and Milan. The authorities were looking into whether Gucci should have paid as much as 1.3 billion Euro in past domestic taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/kering-gucci-tax-investigation.html|title=kering-gucci-tax-investigation|website=nytimes.com|date=16 March 2018|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Including France and UK, the amount of possible tax evasion by Kering is considered to be up to 2.5 billion Euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/evasion-fiscale/article/2018/03/16/le-groupe-francais-de-luxe-kering-aurait-soustrait-2-5-milliards-d-euros-d-impots-selon-mediapart_5272324_4862750.html|title=le-groupe-francais-de-luxe-kering-aurait-soustrait-2-5-milliards-d-euros-d-impots-selon-mediapart|website=lemonde.fr|date=21 March 2018|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poland|Polish]] business title '''''Manager Magazin - Edycja Polska''''' (''manager magazin EDYCJA POLSKA'') was published under license by the German title ''[[Manager Magazin]]'' from 2004 to 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manager Magazin to close|url=http://www.publicitas.com/du/home/media-news-events/news-detail/?newsid=25890&amp;title=poland-manager-magazin-to-close#.VNBtomSsXRA|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=Publicitas|date=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of two major business magazines in Poland at that time.&lt;ref&gt;the other title was the Polish edition of ''[[Forbes]]'', as license published by [[Axel Springer AG|Axel-Springer-Verlag]] in Poland&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and profile==
The title was published by a [[joint venture]] between [[Hamburg]] based ''Manager Magazin Verlagsgesellschaft mbH'' ([[Der Spiegel|Spiegel group]]) and [[Warsaw]] publishing house ''Infor SA''. ''Wydawnictwo Infor Manager Sp. z o.o.'' published its first issue of the Polish ''Manager Magazin'' in November 2004 (issue 12/2004). In 2007 Spiegel group purchased Infor's shares and rebranded the publishing house into ''Manager Media Sp.z o.o.''. 

The magazine focussed on upper managers in Polish business. The title had a print run of 50,000 copies, copy price at 9.80 [[Złoty]]&lt;ref&gt;15 Złoty with inserted CD-ROM&lt;/ref&gt; and sold around 30,000 copies at outlets and via subscription. The magazine was registered at the Polish auditing association ZKDP.&lt;ref&gt;''Związek Kontroli Dystrybucji Prasy''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Editor-in-chief]] for the launch was business journalist Jan Bazyl Lipsczyc. In 2006 Dorota Goliszewska became editor-in-chief. Deputy editors were Dorota Kornacka and Piotr Lemberg. The CEO was Philipp Busch, and later Nikolaus von Nathusius.

Beside the main title ''Manager Magazin'', the company published special issues on specifically focused topics. With the brand ''Manager Eventy'' several kinds of events were organized also: gala events for proprietary-award ceremonies, seminars and workshops. In October 2008 a conference with [[nobelist]] [[Joseph Stiglitz]] was organized in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;information at website of the [[Warsaw School of Economics]] [http://www.sgh.com.pl/informacje/konferencje/atompage.2008-09-26.4430822568/ SGH] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301222213/http://www.sgh.com.pl/informacje/konferencje/atompage.2008-09-26.4430822568/ |date=2012-03-01 }} (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt; 

A change in the Spiegel-group management in 2008 resulted in a change of their foreign investments strategy. Based on the decision to generally withdraw from foreign countries activities,&lt;ref&gt;there have been rumors about plans of Spiegel group to publish a news weekly in Poland, ref. ''Welt.de'' from [https://www.welt.de/wams_print/article1263881/Jubilaeum_fuer_Matussek_und_Preise_fuer_Jung_von_Matt.html 14 October 2007] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ref. to an interview in media trade title ''Horizont'', issue [http://www.horizont.net/aktuell/medien/pages/protected/showRSS.php?id=75495 14/2008] Spiegel in spring 2008 still planned an enlargement of their Polish activities (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ref.

''Gazeta.pl'' from [http://gospodarka.gazeta.pl/gospodarka/1,69806,6022908.html 3 December 2008] (in Polish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ref. ''New-Business.de'' from [http://www.new-business.de/medien/detail.php?rubric=MEDIEN&amp;nr=581630#581630 4 December 2008] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied at his village school in the early years. When his family moved to the Port City of Chittagong, he enrolled at [[Chittagong Collegiate School]] and completed his matriculation. Next, Mosharraf enrolled into Sir Ashutosh College and passed his Higher Secondary Certification Exam.
In 1962, he enrolled in the department of [[Mining Engineering]] at [[University of Engineering and Technology (Lahore)]] and completed his BSc in 1966. He staged several processions and movement for the six-point demand in [[Lahore]].  In 1965 he was appointed President of East Pakistan Student Association in light of justifying the six-point demand of then East Pakistan.

He was elected as the [[Member of Provincial Assembly]] (MPA) for the first time in 1970 from Mirsharai. After the liberation war, he was re-elected as the Member of Parliament in 1973.  Successively, due to his honesty, integrity and sincere love for the people of Mirsharai he was re-elected in 1986 and in 1996 as the MP.  After 1986 Election he was appointed as the opposition party Whip in the National Assembly. After the 1996 election, under the Awami League run Government, he managed the Ministry of Civil Aviation &amp; Tourism and the Ministry of Public Works and Housing with utmost honesty and efficiency in the capacity of full cabinet Minister.  In addition to his post as the President of Chittagong North District Awami League, he has been appointed as the member of Central Working Committee of AL.

===Bangladesh Liberation War===
In 1971 Mosharraf directly participated in the great [[Liberation War of Bangladesh]] as a valiant Freedom Fighter ([[Mukti Bahini]]).  He is one of the very few members of parliament who participated in Liberation War as a Freedom Fighter at that time. During the Liberation War he was engaged as the commander of the sub-sector under sector No 1.  On the violent night of 25 March 1971, when Pakistani soldiers of 25 Brigade marched towards Chittagong from Comilla Cantonment with tanks and artilleries committing atrocities on their way, Mosharraf, upon receiving this information took his comrades and destroyed the Shubhopur Bridge by setting it ablaze so that 25 Brigade of Pakistan could not enter Chittagong.  Later Mosharraf took CNC special training from India and entered the country and conducted more successful operations against [[Pakistani Army]].  He was nearly killed while on mission to destroy Eastern Refinery and while conducting some other important operations in Chittagong. 

=== Business ===
In 1983, Mosharraf founded GasMin Limited "GasMin Limited" an [[ISO 9001:2000]] certified Construction and Engineering Firm primarily providing services in the energy sector development in Bangladesh.  He further expanded the Hotel Sayeman which was first built by his father in 1964 into a 75-room resort with swimming pool and other modern amenities.  To develop the tourism and investment atmosphere in the port city of Chittagong, he further went into development of a long-awaited Four Star Hotel, The Peninsula Chittagong, under joint venture investment from the United States on his family owned land in GEC Circle of Chittagong. 

=== Cabinet Minister ===
After the general election in 1996, Mosharraf was made the Minister of Civil Aviation &amp; Tourism. In 2014 he was made Minister of Public Works &amp; Housing under the Awami League government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.observerbd.com/details.php?id=119860|title=Minister for Housing and Public Works Engineer Mosharraf Hossain - Business - observerbd.com|work=The Daily Observer|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Olateju Oyeleye''' was born in [[Ilesha]], [[Osun State]], [[Nigeria]] on 7 April 1924.&lt;ref name=pamphlet&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Life of Leadership and Service|journal=Teju @ 80: a birthday celebration|year=2004|location=Lagos}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of a farmer, Pa Joseph Oyeleye Aare, whose main produce was cocoa, kolanut, and bitter kola. His mother, Madam Felicia Esan Oyeleye, was a "petty trader" who hawked beans and pap.&lt;ref name=teju&gt;{{cite news|last=Oyeleye|first=Teju|title=Personal Interview|accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early childhood was the foundation of his religious life and core values, where his parents through example developed his faith in God, "respect for others, desire for service, and passion for excellence".&lt;ref name=pamphlet/&gt;
Teju Oyeleye attended Peter's Angliochan Primary School, the equivalent to Elementary School in North America. He later attended Ilesha Grammar School, where he graduated in 1942.&lt;ref name=pamphlet/&gt;
He had several important role models growing up.  His older brother, Daniel Babalola Oyeleye, got him his first job after high school at the Nigerian Post and Telegram, or P&amp;T, organisation, where he worked for about 10 years.  His older brother also encouraged him to follow his passion for science. While working at P&amp;T, he developed a fascination for [[morse code]] and the science around how the [[telegraph key]] worked.   Another mentor was the cousin of a good friend who was a teacher at [[Yaba Technical Institute|Yaba Technical College]].  The cousin's explanation of how a telegraph key functioned and the relationship between electricity and [[magnetism]] was crucial in his selecting Electrical Engineering in college.  A final role model for Teju was Mr. Joseph Onawumi, who encouraged him with his GCE Advanced level classes (the equivalent to AP classes) in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics and assisted him with his application to the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name=gunju&gt;{{cite news|last=Oyeleye|first=Gunju|title=Personal Interview|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== College ==
In 1952, Teju Oyeleye attended the University of London. The scholarship he earned for his exceptional scores on the GCE "A” level examinations, from the Western Nigeria Production Board, aided him in his goal to study Engineering at the university. The field of engineering and science and technology as a whole was relatively new for Teju entering college. His high school, Ilesha Grammar School, did not offer any science classes which left him at a significant disadvantage compared to his peers at University of London.&lt;ref name= Layi&gt;{{cite news|last=Oyeleye|first=Layi|title=Personal Interview|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his unwavering interest in science and technology helped him overcome his shortcomings in the field. In 1957, he received an Electrical Engineering degree from the University of London.&lt;ref name=pamphlet/&gt;
During his time at the University of London, Teju was the president of African Students and was the publicity officer of the college students union.&lt;ref name=teju/&gt;

== Career ==

=== Ferguson Radio Corporation ===
After college, Teju Oyeleye spent two years (1957–1959) getting practical experience at [[Ferguson Radio Corporation]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[North London]].&lt;ref name=teju/&gt; After his experience at Fergusson Radio, Teju Oyeleye returned to Nigeria with his wife Mrs. Funke Oyeleye, a registered nurse.

=== WNTV-WNBS (Western Nigeria Television and Broadcasting Service) ===
Back in Nigeria, Teju Oyeleye jumped into a much bigger project. The Western Nigerian Television Station hired him in September 1959 as a Development Engineer.&lt;ref name=pamphlet/&gt; This was the first television station in Africa which meant a lot of things were required of the company. First, the company needed to provide television service to the general public. They would then have to broadcast channels for the consumers to watch. This required a lot of professionals, many of whom were being called back from their dwellings in England, to come over and establish this new television station in Nigeria.&lt;ref name=gunju/&gt; Teju Oyeleye was one of the engineers chosen to fulfill the demand. 
The television station grew rapidly since Teju's arrival. The shows started in black and white with shows only airing from four o'clock in the afternoon to midnight. The shows that aired included live programs, recorded programs, movies, interviews, outside broadcasts and the radio broadcasting he was also in charge with included the morning news, jingles, and talk shows. [[Color television]] arrived in 1975, a few years after the time Teju Oyeleye moved to his next professional challenge Total Nigeria Limited.&lt;ref name=gunju/&gt; 
As West Nigerian Television and Broadcasting Services (WNTV-WNBS) developed and expanded from one city to the entire continent around the time of Teju's arrival, so did Teju's role in the company become much more integral to the company's success. Teju experienced a series of promotions from his initial program as Development Manager to his position as Chief Engineer, and eventually general manager in 1966 which was the equivalent of chief executive officer in North American companies.&lt;ref name=pamphlet/&gt; He was the first Nigerian general manager of the first television station in Africa. 
Teju's management style was "collaborative in nature and his direct reports were given significant responsibility as well as the accountability that went along with it".&lt;ref name=gunju/&gt; In other words, he encouraged his employees and himself to work with each other to get most tasks done and his workers were responsible for the work they were assigned. He would often set goals for his workers and use simple [[data analysis]] to measure how close they came to accomplishing these goals.
:"We set up the scheme of service, the staff regulations and the financial regulations. We were having a monthly meeting at which we would review the previous month and set out what we were going to do in the ensuing month. We had a programme committee under the chairmanship of the controller of programs. We used participatory management techniques in which each of the 6 HOD's [heads of department] participated in the management. The departments were Administration under the secretary, Engineering under the Chief Engineer, Programs under the Controller of Programs, News and Current Affairs under the Head of News and Commercial under the Commercial Manager who was located in [[Lagos]] because of the strategic location as the commercial and administrative capital at that time".&lt;ref name=teju/&gt;
During his time as general manager, he mentored a lot of second generation Television Station CEOs. A number of his pupils eventually went on to head the newer TV stations while they were being created all across Nigeria.

=== Total Nigeria PLC ===
Eventually Teju felt it was time to leave his executive position at WNTV-WNBS. He made note that "Anytime you don't feel you're contributing sufficiently to a job… it's time to leave".&lt;ref name=gunju/&gt;
When he joined [[Total S.A.|Total]] in 1973, he started as an Assistant Operations Manager. However, in a span of six years and five promotions, he had risen to the rank of general manager, which in this scenario was the equivalent to chief operating officer.  He held this position for another six years, until 1984. His experience as general manager at Western Nigeria Television was not a waste when it came to climbing the ranks. He explained during our interview, "No experience is lost if you value it well".&lt;ref name=teju/&gt;
Prior to him, no other Nigerian had risen to that level in the organisation.  At the time he joined Total they were ranked number three in Nigeria in terms of [[productivity]] amongst the petroleum companies.  Eleven years later when he was promoted from his position as general manager (In this scenario he was the chief operating officer), the brand had risen to be number one in Nigeria.&lt;ref name=gunju/&gt;
For his next assignment, Engineer Oyeleye was asked to help set up several new ventures (similar to incubator companies) for Total.&lt;ref name=gunju/&gt; For the three years he spent in the role of Group Executive Director of Total Nigeria Subsidiaries, Engr. Oyeleye formed several successful subsidiaries that grew significantly in size.  The Nigerian Gas Cylinder Manufacturing company was the first of its kind in Nigeria and manufactured gas cylinders that were used for cooking in almost every home.  Another highly successful subsidiary supplied [[bitumen]] (road tar) and [[lubricant]]s to the country.&lt;ref name=gunju/&gt; Teju Oyeleye retired from Total in 1991, but remained on the board of directors until 1994.&lt;ref name=teju/&gt; He was succeeded as general manager by Sunny A. Olu Jegede.

== Professional Organizations ==

=== Nigerian Society of Engineers ===
In 1958, Olateju Oyeleye and Chief G.O. Aiwereoba formed the Nigerian Society of Engineers in London, England.  After several meetings, the inaugural meeting on the Nigerian Society of Engineers was held at the Nigerian house in London in February that same year. Engr. Teju Oyeleye took on the position of Secretary-General during the earlier years of the organisation, starting from when Chief G.O. Aiwereoba was president.&lt;ref name=Fadahunsi&gt;{{cite book|last=Fadahunsi|first=Samuel|title=Reflections on the Events of My Life|year=2010|publisher=University Press PLC|location=Ibadan|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aiwereoba stepped down the following year and a new president was elected every two years. Teju Oyeleye took over the organisation for two years, in 1976 to 1977.&lt;ref name= pastpresidents&gt;{{cite web|title=NSE Past Presidents|url=http://nsemembership.org|publisher=Nigerian Society of Engineers|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nigerian Society of Engineers was the largest body in Africa that recognised students and graduate engineers. It was founded to create a more unionised voice of Nigeria's engineers so they could discuss with government officials and unofficial authorities topics related to technology. It also served as a beacon of knowledge where so many experienced engineers gathered to share their experiences with the less experienced engineers and also other officials not directly involved in the engineering profession. However, the most important function of this society was to promote the ideas and interests of its members and to protect each member and their families with backup monetary support.&lt;ref name=nse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nse.org.ng|title=What is NSE|publisher=The Nigerian Society of Engineers|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Nigerian Society has over time split into several divisions. A few of these divisions include one for [[Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers|Chemical Engineers]] (NSCE), one for Civil Engineers (NICE), and one for female engineers, APWE.&lt;ref name=nse/&gt;

=== Nigerian Institute of Management ===
Engr. Teju Oyeleye was elected in 1988 to be the eighth president of the [[Nigerian Institute of Management]].&lt;ref name=teju/&gt; The Nigerian Institute of Management was designed to educate any person interested in pursuing a management profession in Nigeria. It sets the standard of knowledge for all managers and ensures that these managers are aware of all the skills vital to successfully running a company. It also judges all potential managers on their [[wikt:Special:Search/qualification|qualifications]] and denies those who are not up to par a profession in the management field.&lt;ref name=nim&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Nigerian Institute of Management|title=About NIM Chartered|url=http://managementnigeria.org|accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Institute was founded in 1961 to educate managers and professionals interested in management with practical skills necessary to assertively and effectively manage a company. The organisation's goal was to educate positive managing traits; like the drive to find more economically efficient ways, being more transparent with all issues, and to avoid fraudulent and unethical practices taking place, in a manager's respective company.&lt;ref name=nim/&gt;
Teju's main responsibility was to decide which standards should be necessary for a manager to run a company. In 1991, however, he stepped down from his position at this organisation.&lt;ref name=teju/&gt;

== Religious life ==
Olateju Oyeleye was baptised at age two and confirmed at age eighteen by Archbishop L.G. Vinnig.&lt;ref name=pamphlet/&gt;
He was a devout Christian, who read the bible from [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] to [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] at age fourteen. Throughout his life he devoted at least one hour to bible study and prayer each day ("A Life of…"). His religion strongly influenced his life and his success at work. He made it his objective to make his life so exemplary that people would follow suit.&lt;ref name=teju/&gt;
Currently, he regularly attends the Cathedral Church of Christ and St Peters Church Isona Ilesa. He also attends Church of Pentecost, or the Anglican Communion where he was baptised, at [[Festac Town]]. In the Cathedral Church of Christ, he is a member of the Torch Bearers society while at Church of Pentecost, he is a grand patron of the Fountain of Hope Society.&lt;ref name=teju/&gt;
During our interview, Teju explained, "Christianity is a way of life. It is a way of living. The power of positive thinking will succeed you in everything you are doing.”

== Family and Relationships ==
Teju Oyeleye married Anne Awujoola Oyeleye (née Smith) in London, England in 1956.  Mrs. Oyeleye was a registered nurse who taught at the Jericho Nursing School in Ibadan after they moved to Nigeria.  They had 3 children Dr. Layi Oyeleye, Dr. Gunju Oyeleye, and Dr. Biola Oyeleye who are engineers and an [[ophthalmologist]] by training, respectively.  Mrs Oyeleye died in a car accident in March 1978.&lt;ref name= Layi/&gt;

After the passing of his first wife, he married Comfort Olubunmi Oyeleye (née Awolowo) in 1979.  Mrs Oyeleye is an Accounting Executive.  They have 3 children Mr. Tolu Oyeleye, Dr. Kike Olaniyan (née Oyeleye), and Mr. Fola Oyeleye.  They are computer scientist, medical doctor, and materials engineer by training, respectively.&lt;ref name= Layi/&gt;

== Awards and Commendations ==
In December 2003, Teju received an Officer of the [[Order of the Niger]] (OON) from previous Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo. This was one of the highest awards given by the president of Nigeria. This award acknowledges his National development, or all the renovations Engr. Olateju Oyeleye made to Nigeria, including his work at WNTV-WNBS, Total Nigeria PLC, NSE, NIM, NCC, and many others.&lt;ref name=teju/&gt;

'''Peak capitalism''' is a term used in recent academic literature to describe a situation in which [[capitalism]] can no longer survive. The phrase is based on the concept of [[peak oil]] and suggests that a capitalist system in a [[postmodern]] world can no longer survive, given that the international system depends entirely upon non-renewable resources to reproduce society.&lt;ref&gt;http://rdwolff.com/content/peak-oil-and-peak-capitalism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://endofcapitalism.com/category/collapse/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://members.optusnet.com.au/~lionelorford/Peak%20Capitalism%20exec%20summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v70637451h2upwj6/ | doi=10.1007/0-306-48082-4_17 | title=Schumpeter and the Crisis of the Tax State | journal=The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences | pages=337–351 | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = Karl-Heinz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, Karl-Heinz 2003, 'Schumpeter and the Crisis of the Tax State', The European Heritage in Economics and the Social Sciences, 2003, Volume 1, pages 337–351&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[state education agency]], its activities are directed by the governor appointed [[Pennsylvania]]'s Secretary of Education. The agency is headquartered at 333 Market Street in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.education.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/department_information/7203 Department Information]", ''Pennsylvania Department of Education''. Retrieved on April 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees 500 public school districts [[List of school districts in Pennsylvania|public school districts of Pennsylvania]], over 170ublic charter schools (2014), 14 public cyber charter schools, Career and Technology Centers/Vocational Technical schools, 29 public [[Intermediate Unit]]s, the education of youth in State Juvenile Correctional Institutions, Head Starts and publicly funded preschools in the Commonwealth (PreK Counts Keystone Stars) and 22 community colleges.

The agency maintains a database of all education institutions in the Commonwealth with associated data. EdNA [http://www.education.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/find_an_institution/7205/education_names_and_addresses__(edna_v_2)/509789] These entities include school districts and their schools, intermediate units, area vocational technical schools, charter schools, nonpublic and private schools, higher education institutions and more.

== History ==
Following passage and signing of the Free School Law on April 1, 1834, the Secretary of the Commonwealth acted as head of the Common School System until 1837.  In that year a separate Department of Schools was created with a Superintendent of Common Schools as its chief officer. In 1873, the title was changed to Superintendent of Public Instruction, and greater responsibilities were assigned to that official and to the Department. In 1969, the name of the Department of Public Instruction was changed to the Department of Education, with the title of Superintendent of Public Instruction changed to the Secretary of Education.  It previously ran the [[Pennsylvania State Board of Censors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/about_pde/7203 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=About PDE |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
The mission statement of the Pennsylvania Department of Education is "to assist the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|General Assembly]], the [[Governor]], the Secretary of Education and Pennsylvania educators in providing for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of education."  The Department has broad discretionary powers in both the development and administration of educational policies which enhance the educational experience and quality in Pennsylvania.  The Department also works as an ongoing study of the educational process within the state, conducting studies and programs designed to evaluate specific needs or qualities of the system.  In doing so, the Pennsylvania Department of Education will recommend changes and improvements to the Governor, the Board of Education, and the General Assembly.

The Pennsylvania Department of Education also oversees policies of public libraries, academic libraries, and the [[State Library of Pennsylvania]] located in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]].  It provides policy of equal opportunity in the educational system, with special regard to nonpublic education and state policy of education.  It is within the Pennsylvania Department of Education's mission to collaborate with other state educational departments in an effort to create a cohesive and dynamic learning environment.

[[File:Waitress taking an order.jpg|thumb|325px|A [[waitress]] writes down the food order of diners]]

In the [[United States]]  and (at least some) other English-speaking countries, a '''pink-collar- worker''' refers to someone working in the care-oriented career field or in jobs historically considered to be "women’s work."  This may include jobs in nursing, teaching, secretarial work, waitressing, or child care.&lt;ref name="statistic1"/&gt; While these jobs may be filled by men, they are typically female-dominated and may or may not pay significantly less than [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] or [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] jobs.&lt;ref name="statistic2"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "pink-collar" was popularized in the late 1970s by writer and social critic Louise Kapp Howe to denote women working as nurses, secretaries, and elementary school teachers. Its origins, however, go back to the early 1970s, to when the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was placed before the states for ratification. At that time, the term was used to denote secretarial staff as well as non-professional office staff, all of which were largely held by women. These positions were not white-collar jobs, but neither were they blue-collar, manual labor. Hence, the creation of the term "pink-collar," which indicated it was not white-collar, was nonetheless an office job and one that was overwhelmingly filled by women.

== Occupations ==
Pink-collar occupations tend to be personal-service-oriented worker working in retail, nursing, and [[Teacher|teaching]] (depending on the level), are part of the [[service sector]], and are among the most common occupations in the [[United States]]. The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] estimates that, as of May 2008, there were over 2.2 million persons employed as servers in the United States.&lt;ref name="statistic1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes353031.htm |title=Occupational Employment and Wages - Waiters and Waitresses |accessdate=2006-12-31 |author=U.S. Department of Labor - Bureau of Labor Statistics |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=24 May 2006 |work= |publisher=US Department of Labor }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the [[World Health Organization]]'s 2011 World Health Statistics Report states that there are 19.3 million nurses in the world today.&lt;ref name="statistic2"&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Statistics 2011|url=http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/2011/en/|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, women comprise 92.1% of the registered nurses that are currently employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quick Facts on Registered Nurses|url=http://www.dol.gov/wb/factsheets/Qf-nursing.htm|publisher=US Department of Labor|accessdate=1 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Historically, women were responsible for the running of a household.&lt;ref&gt;Ware 1982, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Their financial security was often dependent upon a male patriarch. Widowed or divorced women struggled to support themselves and their children.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt;

Women began to develop more opportunities when they moved into the paid workplace, formerly of the male domain. In the 20th century women aimed to be treated like the equals of their male counterparts. In 1920 American women won the [[suffrage|right to vote]], marking a turning point in their roles in life.&lt;ref&gt;Naffziger, Claudeen Cline; et al. (1974). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/582762 "Development of Sex Role Stereotypes"], ''The Family Coordinator'' '''256''' (3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Many single women traveled to cities like New York where they found work in factories and [[sweatshop]]s, working for low pay operating sewing machines, sorting feathers, rolling tobacco and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

These factories were dirty, noisy, dark, and dangerous. Workers frequently breathed dangerous fumes and worked with flammable materials.&lt;ref name="humowitz239"&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; Women lost fingers and hands in accidents because in order to save money they were required to clean and adjust the machines while they were running.&lt;ref name="humowitz239"/&gt; Unfortunately, most women who worked in the factories did not earn enough money to live on and lived in poverty.

Throughout the 20th century certain women helped change women's roles in America. [[Emily Balch]], [[Jane Addams]], and [[Lillian Wald]] are among the most notable.&lt;ref name="gourley99"&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; They created settlement houses and launched missions in crowded, unsanitary neighborhoods where immigrants lived.&lt;ref name="gourley99"/&gt; Balch, Addams, and Wald offered social services to the women and children, often inviting them into their homes and classrooms.&lt;ref name="gourley99"/&gt;

Women took on leadership roles starting in the church. Women became involved with the church activities, a few went on to become president of the societies. The women who joined these societies worked with their members some of whom were full-time teachers, nurses, missionaries, and social workers to accomplish their leadership tasks and make a difference.&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;Wallace, Ruth A (2000). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1388082 "Women and Religion: The Transformation of Leadership Roles,"] ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' '''502''' (4)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]] was the first to elect a woman president in 1938.&lt;ref name="Wallace"/&gt;

=== During World Wars I and II ===
[[File:U.S. Navy Nurse Corps recruiting poster, January 1945 (NH 78855).jpg|150px|thumb|left|A [[U.S. Navy]] recruiting poster from World War II, showing an officer of the [[Navy WAVES]] before a hospital ship]]

[[World War I]] was the beginning of "pink-collar jobs" as the military needed personnel to type letters, answer phones, and perform other tasks. One thousand women worked for the U.S. Navy as [[stenographer]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, clerks, and telephone operators.&lt;ref&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of nursing also became [[Feminisation of the workplace|"feminized"]] and was an accepted profession for women. In 1917, [[Louisa Lee Schuyler]] opened the [[Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing]], the first to train women as professional nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; After completing training, some female nurses worked in hospitals, but most worked in field tents.

[[World War II]] marked the first time women began working in high-paying industrial jobs. They worked in factories and some even joined the armed forces. These women were segregated from men in separate groups. Although women joined the workforce they still encountered discrimination in and out of the workplace, which persisted despite [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|anti-discrimination laws passed in the 1960s]].&lt;ref name="Emily Stoper 1991"/&gt;

Women who joined the armed forces participated in every military field except combat. One thousand female pilots joined the [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]], one hundred and forty thousand women joined the [[Women's Army Corps]] and one hundred thousand women joined the [[U.S. Navy]] as nurses and administrative staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=May |first=Elaine Tyler |title=Pushing the Limits |publisher=Oxford University |location=New York |year=1994 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two million women held office jobs during World War II, which offered job security because they had become "feminized".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hartmann |first=Susan M. |title=The Home Front and Beyond |publisher=G.K. Hall &amp; Co. |location=Boston |year=1982 |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life in the working world ==
[[File:Pink 2.JPG|thumb|This graph shows the increase in women graduating high school and attending college, while there is a decrease in high school dropouts.]]

A typical job sought by working women was that of a [[switchboard operator|telephone operator]] or [[Hello Girls|Hello Girl]]. The Hello Girls began as women who operated on switchboards during the first world war by answering telephones and talking to impatient callers in a calming tone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/news/topics/hello.html|title=Topics in Chronicling America-Hello Girls|last=|first=|date=January 29, 2015|website=The Library of Congress|access-date=December 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The workers would sit on stools facing a wall with hundreds of outlets and tiny blinking lights. The women had to work quickly when a light flashed by plugging the cord into the proper outlet. Despite the difficult work, many women wanted this job because it paid five dollars a week and provided a rest lounge for the employees to take a break.&lt;ref name="Catherine Gourley 2008"/&gt;

Female secretaries were also popular. They were instructed to be efficient, tough, and hardworking while also appearing soft, accommodating, and subservient.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;Rung, Margaret C. (1997). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3116078 "Paternalism and Pink Collar: Gender and Federal Employee Relations,1941-50,"] ''The Business History Review'' '''399''' (3)&lt;/ref&gt; Women were expected to be the protector and partner to their boss behind closed doors and a helpmate in public. These women were encouraged to go to charm schools and express their personality through fashion instead of furthering their education.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

[[Social work]] became a female-dominated profession in the 1930s, emphasizing a group professional identity and the casework method.&lt;ref name="Susan Ware 1982"&gt;Ware 1982, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Social workers gave crucial expertise for the expansion of federal, state and local government, as well as services to meet the needs of the Depression.&lt;ref name="Susan Ware 1982"/&gt;

Teachers in primary and secondary schools remained female, although as the war progressed, women began to move on to better employment and higher salaries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ware 1982, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, teaching positions paid less than $1,500 a year and fell to $800 in rural areas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Women scientists found it hard to gain appointments at universities. Women scientists were forced to take positions in high schools, state or women's colleges, governmental agencies and alternative institutions such as libraries or museums.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Women who took jobs at such places often did clerical duties and though some held professional positions, these boundaries were blurred.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Mostly women were hired as librarians who had been professionalized and feminized. In 1920, women accounted for 88% of librarians in the United States.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Two-thirds of the [[American Geographical Society]] (AGS)'s employees were women, who served as librarians, editorial personnel in the publishing programs, secretaries, research editors, copy editors, proofreaders, research assistants and sales staff. These women came with credentials from well-known colleges and universities and many were overqualified for their positions, but later were promoted to more prestigious positions.

Although female employees did not receive equal pay, they did get sabbaticals to attend university and to travel for their professions at the cost of the AGS.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Monk, Janice (April 2003). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/30033908 "Women's Worlds at the American Geographical Society,"] ''Geographical Review'' '''93''' (2): 237–257&lt;/ref&gt; Those women working managerial and library or museums positions made an impact on women in the work force, but still encountered discrimination when they tried to advance.

In the 1940s, clerical work expanded to occupy the largest number of women employees, this field diversified as it moved into commercial service.&lt;ref&gt;Susan M. Hartmann, The Home Front and Beyond (Boston, MA: G.K. Hall &amp;Co., 1982), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The average worker in the 1940s was over 35 years old, married, and needed to work to keep their families afloat.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, women were taught that marriage and domesticity were more important than a career. Most women followed this path because of the uncertainty of the post-war years.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Suburban housewives were encouraged to have hobbies like bread making and sewing. The 1950s housewife was in conflict between being "just a housewife" because their upbringing taught them competition and achievement. Many women had furthered their education deriving a sense of self-worth.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pay ===

A single woman working in a factory in the early 20th century earned less than $8 a week, which is equivalent to roughly less that $98 dollars a week today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/|title=US Inflation Calculator|website=US Inflation Calculator|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the woman was absent or was late, employers penalized them by docking their pay.&lt;ref name="Catherine Gourley 2008"&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; These women would live in boarding houses costing $1.50 a week, waking at 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to start their ten-hour work day. When women entered the paid workforce in the 1920s they were paid less than men because employers thought the women's jobs were temporary. Employers also paid women less than men because they believed in the "Pin Money Theory", which said that women's earnings were secondary to that of their male counterparts. With this being said, women took typical jobs that were "considerably less substantial than their husbands' in terms of both the average number of hours worked per week as well as continuity over time".&lt;ref name="Hilary Silver 1993"&gt;Silver, Hilary. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/684634 "Housework and Domestic Work,"] ''Sociological Forum'' 182 no.2 (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; However, working women still experienced stress and overload because they were still responsible for the majority of the housework and taking care of the children. This left women isolated and subjected them to their husband's control.&lt;ref name="Hilary Silver 1993" /&gt;

In the early 1900s women's pay was one to three dollars a week and much of that went to living expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Jules (1991). ''Breaking Barriers'' (New York: The Penguin Group), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1900s female tobacco strippers earned five dollars a week, half of what their male coworkers made and [[seamstress]]es made six to seven dollars a week compared to a cutter's salary of $16.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Woloch 1984, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; This differed from women working in factories in the 1900s as they were paid by the piece, not receiving a fixed weekly wage.&lt;ref name="humowitz236-7"&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, pp. 236–237&lt;/ref&gt; Those that were pinching pennies pushed themselves to produce more product so that they earned more money.&lt;ref name="humowitz236-7" /&gt; Women who earned enough to live on found it impossible to keep their salary rate from being reduced because bosses often made "mistakes" in computing a worker's piece rate.&lt;ref name="Humowitz240"&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this, women who received this kind of treatment did not disagree for fear of losing their jobs. Employers would frequently deduct pay for work they deemed imperfect and for simply trying to lighten the mood by laughing or talking while they worked.&lt;ref name="Humowitz240" /&gt; In the 1937 a woman's average yearly salary was $525 compared to a man's salary of $1,027.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; In the 1940s two-thirds of the women who were in the labor force suffered a decrease in earnings; the average weekly paychecks fell from $50 to $37.&lt;ref name="Emily Stoper 1991" /&gt; This gap in wage stayed consistent, as women in 1991 only earned seventy percent of what men earned regardless of their education.&lt;ref name="Emily Stoper 1991"&gt;Stoper, Emily (May 1991). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1046935 "Women's Work, Women's Movement: Taking Stock,"] ''Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science'' '''515''' pp. 151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on in the 1970s and 1980s as women began to fight for equality, they fought against discrimination in jobs where women worked and the educational institutions that would lead to those jobs.&lt;ref name="Emily Stoper 1991" /&gt; In 1973 the average salaries for women were 57% compared to those of men, but this [[gender pay gap|gender earnings gap]] was especially noticeable in pink-collar jobs where the largest number of women were employed.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt; Women were given routine, less responsible jobs available and often with a lower pay than men. These jobs were monotonous and mechanical often with assembly-line procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, a study was carried out that examined the pay differences between single and married women. It was found that married women made substantially less than single women, as single women made up to 97% of what a single man would make and married women would only make up to 62% of married men's pay.&lt;ref name="Waldfogel 1995 584–610"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldfogel|first=Jane|date=1995|title=The Price of Motherhood: Family Status and Women's Pay in Young British Cohort|jstor=2663545|journal=Oxford Economic Papers|volume=47|issue=4|pages=584–610}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was found to potentially be because of taking maternity leaves, as less work related experience would be gained in the time that these women left to care for their children, leading to less investment from the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldfogel|first=Jane|date=1997|title=The Effect of Children on Women's Wages|jstor=2657300|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=62|issue=2|pages=209–217|doi=10.2307/2657300}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also found that women now are more likely to join or re-join the work force after having children, rather than the traditional role of becoming a stay at home mother.&lt;ref name="Waldfogel 1995 584–610"/&gt;

=== Education ===

Women entering the  workforce had difficulty finding a satisfactory job without references or an education.&lt;ref&gt;Gourley 2008, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; However, opportunities for [[higher education]] expanded as women were admitted to all-male schools like the [[United States service academies]] and [[Ivy League]] strongholds.&lt;ref&gt;Woloch 1984, p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; Education became a way for society to shape women into its ideal housewife. In the 1950s, authorities and educators encouraged college because they found new value in vocational training for domesticity.&lt;ref&gt;Woloch 1984, p. 500&lt;/ref&gt; College prepared women for future roles because while men and women were taught together, they were groomed for different paths after they graduated.&lt;ref&gt;Woloch 1984, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; Education started out as a way to teach women how to be a good wife, but education also allowed women to broaden their minds.

Being educated was an expectation for women entering the paying workforce, despite the fact that their male equivalents did not need a high school diploma.&lt;ref&gt;Humowitz Weissman 1978, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; While in college, a woman would experience extracurricular activities, such as a sorority, that offered a separate space for the woman to practice types of social service work that was expected from her.&lt;ref name="Nancy Woloch 1984"&gt;Woloch 1984, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all of a woman's education was done in the classroom. Women were also educated through their peers through "dating". Men and women no longer had to be supervised when alone together. Dating allowed men and women to practice the paired activities that would later become a way of life.&lt;ref name="Nancy Woloch 1984"/&gt;

New women's organizations sprouted up working to reform and protect women in the workplace. The largest and most prestigious of these organizations was The General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC), whose members were conservative middle-class housewives. The International Ladies Garment Workers Union (ILGWU) was formed after women shirtwaist makers went on strike in New York City in 1909. It started as a small walkout, with a handful of members from one shop and grew to a force of ten of thousands, changing the course of the labor movement forever. In 1910 women allied themselves with the Progressive Party who sought to reform social issues.

Another organization that grew out of women in the workforce, was the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor. The Women's Bureau regulated conditions for women employees. As female labor became a crucial part of the economy, efforts by the Women's Bureau increased. The Bureau pushed for employers to take advantage of "women-power" and persuaded women to enter the employment market.

In 1913 the ILGWU signed the well-known "protocol in the Dress and Waist Industry" which was the first contract between labor and management settled by outside negotiators. The contract formalized the trade's division of labor by gender.

Another win for women came in 1921 when congress passed the Sheppard-Towner Act, a welfare measure intended to reduce infant and maternal mortality; it was the first federally funded healthcare act. The act provided federal funds to establish health centers for prenatal and child care. Expectant mothers and children could receive health checkups and health advice. &lt;!-- This paragraph seems to be more about the expansions of women's rights than it is about pink-collar workers, I would recommend taking it out Kali Moumblow (talk) 20:11, 16 November 2017 (UTC)) --&gt;

In 1963 the Equal Pay Act was passed making it the first federal law against sex discrimination, equal pay for equal work, and made employers hire women workers if they qualified from the start.

Unions also became a major outlet for women to fight against the unfair treatment they experienced. Women who joined these types of unions stayed before and after work to talk about the benefits of the union, collect dues, obtain charters, and form bargaining committees.

The National Recovery Administration (NRA) was approved in May 1933. The NRA negotiated codes designed to rekindle production. It raised wages, shortened workers' hours, and increased employment for the first time maximizing hour and minimizing wage provisions benefiting female workers. The NRA had its flaws however, it only covered half of the women in the workforce particularly manufacturing and trade. The NRA regulated working conditions only for women with a job and did not offer any relief for the two million unemployed women who desperately needed it.

The 1930s proved successful for women in the workplace thanks to federal relief programs and the growth of unions. For the first time women were not completely dependent on themselves, in 1933 the federal government expanded in its responsibility to female workers. In 1938 the Fair Labor Standards Act grew out of several successful strikes. Two million women joined the workforce during the Great Depression despite negative public opinion.

==Pink ghetto==
"'''Pink ghetto'''" is a term used to refer to jobs dominated by women. The term was coined in 1983 to describe the limits women have in furthering their careers, since the jobs are often dead-end, stressful and underpaid. The term ''pink ghetto'' is just simply another way of describing pink-collar work. ''Pink ghetto'' was more commonly used in the early years, when women were finally able to work. Pink-collar work became the popular term once it was popularized by Louise Kapp Howe, a writer and social critic, in the 1970s.

''Pink ghetto'' can also describe the placement of female managers into positions that will not lead them to the [[board room]], thus perpetuating the "[[glass ceiling]]". This includes managing areas such as human resources, customer service, and other areas that do not contribute to the corporate "bottom line".

Scholars such as Judy Wajcman argue that technology has long been monopolized by men and is a great source of their power historically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BtaiFSv09jMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=technology+displaces+jobs+for+men&amp;ots=KDnJauxEJQ&amp;sig=OWtNUf_MqgUz-VTNZPDigVtTJEY#v=onepage&amp;q=technology%20displaces%20jobs%20for%20men&amp;f=false|title=Feminism Confronts Technology|last=Wajcman|first=Judy|date=1991|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0271008024|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more millennial men are doing pink collar work because technology is affecting blue collar work. Machines are able to perform many of the tasks that were typically gendered male within factories. In a 1990 study conducted by Allan H. Hunt and Timothy L. Hunt, they examined how industrial robots would impact both the creation of jobs as well as job displacement among unskilled workers in the United States. It was concluded that the impact of unemployment due to the spread of robotics would be felt the greatest by uneducated, unskilled blue-collar workers. New technology in the form of robotics eliminates many semi or unskilled jobs, and has taken traditional men filled roles away from the job market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L.|first=Hunt, H. Allan{{!}}Hunt, Timothy|date=1983-00-00|title=Human Resource Implications of Robotics.|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED228547|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judy Wajman maintains that skills involving machines and strength are associated with masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Male Designs on Technology|last=Wajman|first=Judy|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the least technical jobs (pink-collar) jobs are associated with women. These machines designed by men, using the technology they have always monopolized, are now displacing them and forcing them into feminized pink-collar work.

It was found as well that men going into traditionally claimed pink collar jobs are felt discriminated and threatened in their jobs.&lt;ref name="Kalokerinos 553–565"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kalokerinos|first=Elise K.|last2=Kjelsaas|first2=Kathleen|last3=Bennetts|first3=Steven|last4=von Hippel|first4=Courtney|date=2017-08-01|title=Men in pink collars: Stereotype threat and disengagement among male teachers and child protection workers|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2246/abstract|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|language=en|volume=47|issue=5|pages=553–565|doi=10.1002/ejsp.2246|issn=1099-0992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men going into positions such as teaching, nursing and childcare faced many negative stereotypes in these lines of work, as men have traditionally been viewed as stern, strong and holding dominant attitudes. This stereotype about men negatively impacts men in these lines of work, as it is expected that a woman with the same position would be more nurturing, caring and well suited for the work.&lt;ref name="Kalokerinos 553–565"/&gt;

}}'''Pino Tovaglia''' (3 December 1923 - 30 November 1977) was an Italian graphic designer. He is regarded as one of the major exponents of the [[International Typographic Style|Swiss Style]] in Italy.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Born in [[Milan]], Tovaglia was active in the field of graphic design since his youth, first as an assistant of  [[Carlo Carrà]], and then as a collaborator of  [[Marco Zanuso]], [[Giò Ponti]], and the Castiglioni  brothers. From 1946 he was professor of graphic design in several art schools of Milan.&lt;ref name="Vogue"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fabia Di Drusco|title=Focus su Pino Tovaglia|url=http://www.vogue.it/uomo-vogue/news/2012/04/pino-tovaglia-triennale|accessdate=14 October 2016|work=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 Tovaglia won the National Prize of Advertising thanks to an advertisement series made for [[Finmeccanica]]. In 1956 he founded the NCPT Studio together with Giulio Confalonieri, Ilio Negri and Michele Provinciali. In 1958 he won the Golden Palm at the  [[Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;Giorgio Fioravanti. "Pino Tovaglia". ''Il dizionario del grafico''. Bologna, Zanichelli, 1993.{{ISBN|88-08-14116-0}}.  p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1967 to 1970 Tovaglia was art director of [[Pirelli]], and in the same period he realized famous posters such as ''Italia da salvare'' (1967), ''Cinturato Pirelli'' (1967) and ''Brandy Stock'' (1970). In 1972 he realized the restyling of the [[Alfa Romeo]] logo, while in 1975 he designed the symbol of the [[Lombardy Region]] in collaboration with [[Bruno Munari]], [[Bob Noorda]] and Roberto Sambonet.&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;

A member of [[Alliance Graphique Internationale]], in 1998 he was awarded a posthumous [[Compasso d'Oro]] for his career. A collection consisting in over 13,000 pieces is kept at the CSAC (Study Center and Archives of Communication) of the [[University of Parma]], and several of his works are part of the permanent collection at [[MoMa]], New York.&lt;ref name="Vogue"/&gt;

==Background==
Seow Poh Leng, the second son of Seow Chye Watt,&lt;ref name="song"&gt;Song Ong Siang (1923) ''One Hundred Years' History of the Chinese in Singapore''.London : J. Murray. pp 474 - 475&lt;/ref&gt; came from humble beginnings. He spent two years in a Chinese school and completed his schooling at the [[Anglo-Chinese School]]. After passing his [[Senior Cambridge]] examinations, he decided to become a teacher. He competed for the [[Queen's Scholarships]] in 1902. He failed to win the much-coveted prize, and attributed his failure to the fact that he had to divide his time between his duties as a pupil teacher and preparing for the examinations.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMBRAS1923"&gt;[[Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society]] By Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Malayan Branch Published by The Branch, 1923 Item notes: v.26 1953; p. 117. 118, 119 and Journal By Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Malaysian Branch, Published 1958, Pgs 117, 119 &amp; 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to help support his family, he was forced to take up additional work. After school each day he would sell [[nonya]] cakes and [[nasi lemak]] cooked by his mother and sisters. One day, when he saw some of his pupils in the distance, he threw all of his food away fearing they would see him and lose respect for him. He was punished when he returned home.

Later, Seow moved on from teaching to become the manager of the [[Ho Hong Bank]]. He was also a cashier at [[John Little (department store)|John Little]] &amp; Co for many years, before he entered the [[rice]] business. His chequered career included stints as a chemist's assistant, schoolmaster, lawyer's clerk, stock-broker, insurance agent and company liquidator.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMBRAS1923"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese in Southeast Asia and Beyond By Qinghuang Yan, {{ISBN|981-279-047-0}}, {{ISBN|978-981-279-047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the promoters of the [[Eastern United Assurance Corporation]] Ltd. (EUA), [[Chinese Commercial Bank]] (CCB) and [[Ho Hong Bank]] (HHB). He founded HHB in January 1917&lt;ref&gt;[http://exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg/limboonkeng/EN/SE06-Entrepreneur-02.html Lim Boon Keng - A Life To Remember (1969-1857), Exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218091357/http://exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg/limboonkeng/EN/SE06-Entrepreneur-02.html |date=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[Lim Peng Siang]], Dr [[Lim Boon Keng]] and others, and served as its secretary and general manager. HHB was the first Straits Chinese institution to enter the field of worldwide banking and established connections with [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] and many others, in order to facilitate direct trade between the Chinese in [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and people in other parts of the world. Later, HHB was amalgamated with CCB and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (OCBC).&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JMBRAS1923"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Readings in Malayan Economics By Thomas Henry Silcock Compiled by Thomas Henry Silcock Published by Published by D.

According to government archives, Seow was responsible for the development of a row of nine terrace houses along Cairnhill Road. The same records show that he owned bungalows in [[Emerald Hill Road]] and Lorong 20 Geylang Road, and had additions and alterations done to them.&lt;ref&gt;Singapore National Archives -- Maps &amp; Building Plans 1918, 1926, 1927, 1929 -- Microfilm No: CBS 105, Microfilm No: CBS 1105, Microfilm No: CBS 1038&lt;/ref&gt; He bought  117 Emerald Hill in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Illustrated Magazine Publishing Co.,Ltd., 1992: Singapore: days of old, Page 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public life==
Seow Poh Leng was concerned with public welfare and engaged in many different roles and activities in this area. He suggested constructing a short connection road between Emerald Hill Road and Cairnhill Circle.&lt;ref&gt;(Vide Government Records -- Singapore Improvement Trust -- File Reference No: SIT 945/31, File Opened 16/08/1936, File Closed 04/08/1954, Microfilm No.: HDB 1028 Blip No: CD No .: PDF No. Access: 01.)&lt;/ref&gt; He was also involved with the Singapore and South Malaya Boy Scouts Association since its inauguration, holding the position of secretary and treasurer, and did much to interest parents in the movement. Other activities included organising charity and social concerts and entertainment. His contributions to the ''Straits Chinese Magazine'' dealt with such subjects as education and social reform.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;

A love of [[theatre]] ran in the family. According to Sir Song Ong Siang, Seow took part in amateur theatricals in the 1930s. He was a lover of [[Shakespeare]] and named his seaside bungalow in Siglap "Titania" and his house on Emerald Hill Road, "Oberon."&lt;ref&gt;Emerald Hill, the Story of a Street in Words and Pictures: The Story of a Street in Words and Pictures By Kip Lin Lee, National Museum (Singapore), National Museum (Singapore) Published by National Museum, 1984; pp. vi, 22, 23&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered modern and loved artistic activities such as acting and singing, and served as the Hon. Secretary to the Straits Chinese Recreation Club in 1905.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama By Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn Contributor Gabrielle H. Cody, Evert Sprinchorn Published by Columbia University Press, 2007; Item notes: v.1; {{ISBN|0-231-14032-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-231-14032-4}}; p. 775&lt;/ref&gt;

Seow was a keen sportsman on the football field and in club sports, a tennis player and a chess player. He was one of the early members of Tanjong Katong Swimming Party, now the Chinese Swimming Club, where he once held the office of vice-president. During the early years of the volunteer movement, he served in its ranks.&lt;ref name="song"/&gt;

In 1936 His Excellency The Governor appointed him to be a member of the Council of Raffles College.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 3 November 1936, Page 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 he was elected to membership of the Council of the King Edward VII College of Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 22 May 1937, Page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from The Hawker Bill, in which he played a major role, he was also associated with other subjects he believed to be of  importance to the common man like championing pedal rickshaws&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 27 April 1936, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt; and the abolition of water meter rents.&lt;ref&gt;The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 7 November 1936, Page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawker Bill==
[[Hawker centre|Hawkers]] had been considered by some people to be a nuisance. In 1903, a bill was drafted by the Chinese Protectorate to provide licensing of hawkers and setting aside spaces where hawking was allowed. In 1905, Municipal Commissioners asked that the Municipal Ordinance be amended to provide them with the necessary powers to register hawkers and bring them under control, but this was refused by the Governor. There were numerous other activities through the years intended to regulate and control the number and activities of hawkers. The view among some people was that the evils of hawking were becoming more serious year on year.&lt;ref name="hawker"&gt;Report of the Committee Appointed to Investigate the Hawker Question in Singapore printed at the Government Printing Office in Singapore by W. T. Cherey, Government Printer, 1932 incorporating (1) Report of the Committee Appointed to Investigate the Hawker Question in Singapore dated 4 November 1931, (2) Minutes of a meeting between the committee (W. Bartley, R. Onrart, J. A. Black, Gaw Khek Khiam, S. Q. Wong and Dr. K. Ragunatuan) and Seow Poh Leng dated 25 August 1931, (3) Memorandum from Seow Poh Leng to the President of the Municipal Commissioners of Singapore dated 1 June 1931 relating to a meeting on 9 March 1931, (4) Annexment I of "C" being a reprint of The Hapless Hawker: A Plea for Humane Treatment by Seow Poh Leng, J.

E." by Seow Poh Leng in the ''Malaya Tribune'' 4 April 1931, (6) Annexment IV of "C" being a table of comparative prices (hawkers versus shops or markets) of common articles during the last week in May 1931, provided by Seow Poh Leng (7) Attachment to Annexment IV of "C" being a supplementary schedule of comparative prices (hawkers versus shops or markets) handed in by Seow Poh Leng to meeting of hawkers committee on 25 August 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, the Governor of Singapore appointed a committee "to investigate the hawker question in Singapore and to make recommendations as to any change in policy in this respect which may be considered advisable", consulting and taking evidence from the Municipal Health Officer, the police, Superintendent of Town Cleansing, Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Clerical Union, [[Teo Chew]] guilds, Indo-Ceylon Club and the Straits Chinese-British Association.&lt;ref name="hawker"/&gt;

Seow championed the plight of hawkers who he felt were being treated callously and without any regard for the social benefits they were bringing, or for their own precarious economic situation. Through articles in the newspaper, including a self-composed poem, depositions and meetings with the committee. He sought to achieve a fair and balanced outcome that would take into consideration the needs of the masses who were not European, and who relied on the lower-priced food and non-food merchandise provided by the street hawkers of Singapore, exposing in the process the constant brutality hawkers faced from the authorities and bribery hawkers often had to resort to in order to continue to operate.&lt;ref name="hawker"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Seow's family lived in a shop house along Emerald Hill Road opposite Dr [[Lim Boon Keng]], whom he had worked for on a part-time basis. When Lim heard that Lilian LuckNeo Tan's family were looking for a groom for her, he recommended Seow to them. Lilian's family wanted a kind and good man for her and it did not matter to them if he was from a poor or rich family. Lilian was the great grand daughter of famous philanthropist Tan Tock Seng. Her father was Tan Soon Toh and her mother was Lin Neo (Jambol) Seow. Tan Soon Toh's father was [[Tan Kim Ching]], Siamese Consul General in Singapore and the person who introduced the schoolteacher, Anna Hariette Leonowens, to the King of Siam.&lt;ref&gt;{{gutenberg|no=8678|name=The English Governess at the Siamese Court by Anna Harriette Leonowens}} (Project Gutenberg)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hobden, Heather ''The King of Siam's Eclipse: the total solar eclipse of August 18th 1868 and other fateful eclipses in Thailand'' ({{ISBN|978-1-871443-32-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Cavenagh Private Letterbooks Volume XI Oct 1865 To Oct 1868 and Volume VII 10th Jul 1863 To 27th Dec 1863''. University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Tan Kim Ching was the son of [[Tan Tock Seng]].&lt;ref name="Edwin Lee 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rose"&gt;Lim, Betty (1994) A Rose on My Pillow: recollections of a Nyonya. Singapore : Armour Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lilian Tan was a refined lady, spared from having to do household chores. Her family lived in a three-storey house along River Valley Road. When the time came for her to be bethrothed, her parents decided the groom should marry into their family which was a common practice at the time. This meant that her husband would come and set up home in her family's house. Their marriage produced three children - (Seow Sieu Jin, Amy Seow Guat-Cheng and Betty Seow Guat-Beng - later Mrs Betty [[Lim Koon Teck]]).&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;

One evening, Lilian was out riding in the family's horse carriage and happened to pass by Bidadari, the Christian cemetery. She noted how peaceful it looked and mentioned that she would like to be buried there when her time came. When the first [[influenza]] epidemic hit Singapore, Lillian succumbed to the virus. She died in October 1918 at the age of 32. In accordance with her wish for a [[Christian]] burial, Seow asked a pastor to baptise her and she was buried at Bidadari. Lilian's mother later converted to Christianity.&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times, 17 October 1918, Page 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Seow remarried a few years after Lilian's death. His new wife, Polly Tan Poh Li (daughter of [[Tan Boo Liat]]) was his niece. Lilian's mother thought it would not be a bad thing for Seow to marry her.&lt;ref name="Edwin Lee 1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rose"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerald Hill, the story of a street in words and pictures by  Kip Lin Lee, National Museum (Singapore), Published by National Museum (Singapore), 1984&lt;/ref&gt; His children by Polly were Eugene Seow Eu Jin and Rosie Seow Guat Kheng.&lt;ref&gt;Seow Poh Leng By Lee, Hwee Hoon (2009-01-14) National Library Board Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[alumnus]] of the Anglo Chinese School, Seow instituted a medal in 1936 to be awarded to the top ACS boy at the Senior Cambridge/GCE "O" Level Examinations.

'''''The Money of Invention: How Venture Capital Creates New Wealth''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book about [[venture capital]], written by [[Paul A. Gompers]] and [[Josh Lerner]], Professors of Business Administration at [[Harvard Business School]]. The book was first published in 2001 by the Harvard Business School Press. It is considered one of the best studies about the venture capital industry in United States.

== Overview ==
''The Money of Invention'' is a non-technical overview of the venture capital (VC), written for a general audience who wants to understand how VC industry works.&lt;ref name="kingston"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kingston|first=George|year=2003|title=Review of The Money of Invention|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Magazine|volume= 20|pages=325–332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="morck"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morck|first=Randall |date=Dec 2002|title=Review: The Money of Invention|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume= 40|issue= 4|pages=1259–1261|jstor=3217345|publisher=American Economic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is composed of three major sections. The first section focuses on the perspective of the [[entrepreneur]]s, the second on the venture capitalists, and the third on what Gompers and Lerner call 'the emulators', organizations that try to copy the venture capital model.

In the first section, the authors identify the challenges entrepreneurs face when trying to raise [[capital (economics)|capital]]: (1) ''[[uncertainty]]'' about the future; (2) ''information gaps'' about the new product and the market for it; (3) the predominance of ''soft assets'' (e.g. [[patent]]s, [[trade secret]]s), in contrast to hard assets (e.g. land, equipment) that are easier to finance; and (4) the [[volatility (finance)|volatility]] of the ''product- and [[financial market]] conditions''. The authors then explain how VCs addresses these problems: screening mechanisms, [[due diligence]], [[staged financing]], [[syndicated investment]], [[executive compensation]] rules, financing covenants like [[convertible debt]], and [[corporate governance]] mechanisms are some of the solutions employed and discussed in the book.

In the second section, the authors focus on venture capital organizations. This section is part a historical account about the VC industry in United States, beginning with the founding of the first modern VC firm, [[American Research and Development Corporation]], by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] president [[Karl Compton]] and [[Harvard Business School|HBS]] professor [[Georges Doriot]], in 1946. It also explores subsequent VC booms to the federally guaranteed [[Small Business Administration|Small Business Investment Companies]] Program in the 1960s and the 1974 [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]], allowing a "prudent man" to hold some high-risk investments and increasing the flow of institutional money into the VC business. This section also describes the ways in which venture capital is structured, connecting its success to the [[limited partnership]] structure (e.g. [[management fee]]s, [[carried interest]]s, contractual restrictions); the mechanisms to raise funds and the emergence of the [[fund of fund]]s; and the challenges of the regulators to grapple with its information gap problems. The section closes with a detailed study of the [[overshooting]] phenomena that explains the volatility of the returns of the industry.

The third section of the book looks at efforts to apply the principles of venture investing in [[corporation|corporate]], [[public sector]], educational, and international settings. The authors argue that the lack of adequate [[Executive compensation|compensation]] schemes and [[organizational structure]]s usually limit the success of the venture capital model in these settings.

== Reviews ==
Randall Morck, an academic in the field, says that the book is "accessible to undergraduates and MBAs with little economics and to the general reader", but recommends ''[[The Venture Capital Cycle]]'' (Paul Gompers and Josh Lerner 1999, Cambridge: MIT Press) from the same authors for a high-level academic treatment of the same issues. He further states that the book may be interesting to economists, explaining that "the familiar problems of [[agency cost]], [[information asymmetry]], [[adverse selection]], and [[moral hazard]] assume overarching importance in the VC business." He praises the book for giving "clarifying to these problems", being useful to "counterweight the more traditional presentation of these issues".&lt;ref name=morck /&gt;

Reviewers also say that the authors "are strong supporters of the venture capital model", and hence "the reader is left with little doubt that the VC business has managed the trick at least tolerably well." &lt;ref name=kingston /&gt;&lt;ref name=morck /&gt; George Kingston points out that the book was published prior to the [[stock market]] downturn of the [[internet bubble]] and "it does not address the impact of these events on venture capital".&lt;ref name=kingston /&gt;

'''Trevor James Flugge''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|l|uː|g|i}} {{respell|FLOO|ghee}}; born 1 February 1947) is an [[Australia]]n farmer and businessman. He is best known as a former official of the [[Australian Wheat Board]] (AWB).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianwoolgrowers.com.au/media_links.html Australian Wool Growers Association] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206002825/http://www.australianwoolgrowers.com.au/media_links.html |date=6 February 2007 }} (accessed:13-03-2007)&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the board in 1984, was chair of AWB in 1995-2002, and was present at meetings in [[Iraq]] which were linked to the [[Oil-for-Food Programme#Oil for wheat|Oil-for-Food scandal]], and an [[Paul Volcker Committee|inquiry by the United Nations]].

==Background==
Flugge was educated at [[Aquinas College, Perth]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://owca.org.au/june2004.pdf ''OWCA'', June 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; and became a farmer in the [[Katanning, Western Australia|Katanning]] area.

In 1987, he was an unsuccessful [[National Party of Australia|National Party]] candidate for the seat of [[Division of O'Connor|O'Connor]] (against [[Wilson Tuckey]]) at the [[Australian federal election, 1987|Australian election]] that year.

Flugge has also served as chair of the Australian Wheat Growers Association, and as a board member of the major diversified company [[Wesfarmers]]

==Oil-for-Food scandal &amp; the Cole Inquiry==
Trevor Flugge was chair of AWB until March 2002, when he was voted off the board by A-class shareholders (wheat growers). He was appointed a consultant to AWB after the vote and travelled to [[Baghdad]] later that year, with AWB chairman [[Andrew Lindberg]], to rescue an AWB wheat export deal with [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime.

There were later accusations that AWB had paid [[bribe]]s to secure the export contract. AWB officials agreed to pay [[US dollar|$]]2 million to the Iraqi regime, which would then allow wheat exports to resume. This payment was made by inflating the price of wheat contracts administered by the [[United Nations]] [[Oil-for-Food Program]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/02/02/1138836372830.html The Age - The Odd Stray Shot] (accessed:13-03-2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 invasion]] and overthrow of the Hussein regime, Flugge was made a senior adviser to the Iraqi agriculture department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/media/transcripts/2003/030422_flugge_iraq.html Transcript - Alexander Downer Interview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218154214/http://www.dfat.gov.au/media/transcripts/2003/030422_flugge_iraq.html |date=18 February 2007 }} (accessed:13-03-2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the bribery became public in 2005, Flugge denied to the UN's [[Paul Volcker Committee|Volker inquiry]] that he knew about AWB's payments to the Hussein regime. Flugge was also called before an Australian government investigation in 2005, the [[Cole inquiry]]. When giving evidence to the latter inquiry, Flugge frequently claimed to have no knowledge of matters discussed at meetings he attended, due to hearing loss.
