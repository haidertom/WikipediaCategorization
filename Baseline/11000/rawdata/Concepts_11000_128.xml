      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6935">[[Image:Airbus A380 seatmap.svg|thumb|right|An [[Airbus A380]] layout with 519 seats displayed]]
{{original research|date=November 2016}}

An '''aircraft seat map''' or '''seating chart''', is a diagram of the [[airline seat|seat]] layout inside a passenger [[airliner]].  They are often published by airlines for informational purposes, and are of use to passengers for selection of their seat at booking or check-in.

Seat maps usually indicate the basic seating layout, the numbering and lettering of the seats, the location of the [[emergency exit]]s, [[Aircraft lavatory|lavatories]], [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]]s, [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s and wings. Airlines which allow internet check-in frequently present a seat map indicating free and occupied seats to the passenger so that they select their seat from it.

In addition to the published seat maps from airliners, there are a number of independent websites which also publish seat maps along with reviews of individual seats, noting the particularly good (extra legroom, quiet cabin, etc.) or bad (lack of recline, unusually cramped, missing window, etc.) seats.

==Published by airlines==
Most of the airlines publish the seat configurations for their aircraft, but the quality of these seat maps is sometimes questionable. Some of the details and information about seats are confusing. Usually airlines do not publish seat maps for every aircraft, only for the larger aircraft and for the ones flying on frequent routes.

When passengers complete an online booking, or check in online, they are often also presented with an aircraft seat map. However, this data is typically sourced from the original text-only seat maps on computer reservation systems such as [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]] where the seatmap is simply held as a two-dimensional array and as such can only display a grid of seats, as opposed to the more ingenious layouts now used in First and Business Class.

Nichols et al. (2013) have reported that when people book seats on-line, they exhibit a leftward preference for seats on an aircraft, but a rightward preference for seats at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholls, M. E. R., Thomas, N. A, and Loetscher, T., "An Online Means of Testing Asymetries in Seating Preference Reveals a Bias for Airplanes and Theatres", ''[[Human Factors (journal)|Human Factors]]'', Vol. 55, Issue 4 (2), August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published by specialized websites==
In addition to those published seat maps which can be found on airline websites, there are some other websites that publish aircraft seat maps for almost all commercial carriers. Seat maps that can be found on these sites usually have more details and on some websites you can find comments from other passengers with advantages and disadvantages about each seat.

The accuracy and editorial independence of specialised websites showing seat maps have also been questioned. [[SeatGuru]] has come under scrutiny since it was sold to the online booking agent Expedia for $1.2m,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airreview.com/News/Story/0.htm, “Airreview'', May 8, 2007, accessed Feb 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and Expedia now use the SeatGuru information when selling seats. As a result, SeatGuru has received some criticism for presenting seat maps which are inaccurate and where no one from the company has travelled on the aircraft;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upgradetravelbetter.com/2009/06/01/airline-seat-advice-showdown-seatguru-seatexpert/ Airline seat advice showdown 2009: SeatGuru vs. SeatExpert | Upgrade: Travel Better&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912090510/http://www.upgradetravelbetter.com/2009/06/01/airline-seat-advice-showdown-seatguru-seatexpert/ |date=September 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example showing bars on aircraft where there are none (on the Singapore A380) or seat rows that don’t exist (on the Emirates A380).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/archive/t-1141727.html SeatGuru vs. SeatExpert: Which one to believe? [Archive&amp;#93; - FlyerTalk Forums&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest generation of user-generated airline seatmaps include comments from frequent flyers, and one specialised website has gained access from airlines to take pictures of every seat,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airreview.com/Seatmap|title=Airline seating plans from Airreview.com|work=mapseat.com|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sit in them to write specific recommendations, alongside the detailed seat maps.

==Seat designation==
[[Image:AircraftSeatHJK.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Right-hand 3 seats skip over letter "I"]]
On many aircraft, the rightmost seats have letter designations HJK, skipping the letter I. This is because each seat has a row number followed by letter; letters that confuse with numbers (I, O, Q, S, or Z) must be avoided. [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) was the first to implement this, avoiding I (1), O (0) and S (5). The remaining letters are called the DEC alphabet.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Occasionally, aircraft with a seating structure of 2+2 may letter the seats as "ACDF" to keep with the standard of A/F being window and C/D being aisle on short-haul aircraft (which generally have 3+3 seats).

In First and Business class cabins, the seat letters for the window seats will typically be the same as in coach, with some letters skipped in between as there are fewer seats per row. For example, if economy cabin is ten across, labeled ABC-DEFG-HJK, the Business Class cabin might be labeled AC-DG-HK for a six across layout, with A-DG-K for a four across First Class. One notable exception to this is [[Delta Air Lines]], who uses sequential letters regardless of cabin layout on all aircraft (AB-CD-EF in Business Class and ABC-DEF-GHJ in Economy).

Some airlines omit the row number 13, reputedly because of a widespread superstition [[Triskaidekaphobia|that the number is unlucky]]. This is the case with [[Lufthansa]], for example (as shown on the [https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Lufthansa/Lufthansa_Airbus_A321_NEK.php Lufthansa A321/100 seating plan]). Emirates used to have a row 13, but on their latest A380 aircraft have removed it (as shown on [http://www.airreview.com/Seatmap/Emirates/A380/index.htm Emirates A380-800 seating plan]). [[British Airways]] is less superstitious, and their [http://www.britishairways.com/travel/clbeur/public/en_gb seat maps for A320 aircraft] shows a row 13. [[Delta Air Lines]] also includes row 13 in many of their seat maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Delta Airlines Airbus A320  Seat Map - SeatLink|url = https://www.seatlink.com/airlines/delta-airlines/seat-maps/delta-airlines-airbus-a320-320-32r-seat-map/|website = www.seatlink.com|accessdate = 2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alakh Niranjan''' is a term used by [[Nath]] Yogis as a synonym for [[Creator deity|Creator]], and to describe the characteristics of God and the Self, known as the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. ''Alakh'' means "one which cannot be seen (perceived)" and ''niranjan'' means "spotfree".  Niranjan is another name of Lord [[Shiva]]. Also spelled, "Alekh".

The original Sanskrit term ''Alakhshya'' means "one that can not be perceived"&lt;ref&gt;http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.5:1:413.apte&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alakh Niranjan in Yoga tradition==
Alakh means '''A-Lakhshana''' which means beyond identifying features (lakhshana) or attributes. It refers to Attributeless God or [[Nirguna]] [[Brahman]] in here. This idea comes from ancient Yoga traditions originating in Swetashwetara Upanishad. This particular [[Upanishad]] deals with Yoga, [[Vedantic]] [[Monotheism]] as well as [[Shiva]] as [[Sat-Chit-Ananda]].
-
Legend has it, that the slogan or elating cry for the Supreme Being was first coined by [[Matsyendranath]]''. Matsyendra is popularly regarded as the 'second [[Guru]]' of Nath Yoga Cult after Lord Shiva as [[Adinath Shiva|Adinath]]. He first used the words "Alakh Niranjan" to denote God as perceived by a Yoga adept in known history. His disciple is known as ''Yogi Gorakhnath'', also known as ''[[Gorakshanath]]'', without whose mention, Nath Yoga becomes unimaginable. It is Gorakhnath and Matsyendranath who popularised Kaya Sadhana throughout known limits of India and beyond. 

Gorakhnath actually organised and assimilated most Yogis of the [[Hatha Yoga]] and [[Tantra]] Cult into the enormous Nath tradition. The city of [[Gorakhpur]] in North India is named after the legendary Yogi. 'Alakh Niranjan' became a very popular name for God all over India during and after Gorakhnath's time. Later first [[Sikh Guru]], [[Nanak]] used this holy name to denote God.
* Famous works by Guru Matsyendranath: ''Kaulayogini Tantra''.
* Guru Gorakhnath's celebrated works are ''[[Gorakhsha Samhita]]'', ''Yoga-Bija''.
* Guru Nanak's works include Japji Sahib.

ADESH ADESH - 
Whenever Yogis or Nath-Yogis meet, they greet each other with the salutation “Adesh-Adesh!” Gorakshanath the Maha Yogi wrote:

:''Aatmetu paramaatmeti jiivatmeti vicaarane''
:''Trayaanaam aikya-samshutir asdes’s iti kiirtitah''

::''In our relative thought we distinguish between Atman, Paramatman, and Jiva.''
::''The Truth is that these three are one and a realization of it is called [[Adesha]].''


Thus the yogi in his contact with others expressed only the simple truth in the words, “Adesh-Adesh!” It is a foundation stone on which all spiritual light and attainment must be erected. It is the first truth to attain the First Lord

==Film adaptions==
Alakh Niranjan was adapted into Indian films in 1940, 1950, and in 1975 by [[Babubhai Mistry]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/find?s=tt&amp;q=Alakh+Niranjan Alakh Niranjan] [[IMDB]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], ''aufheben'' is used by [[Hegel]] to explain what happens when a thesis and [[antithesis]] interact, and in this sense is translated mainly as "sublate".&lt;ref name="hegel" /&gt;

==Hegel==
In Hegel, the term ''Aufhebung'' has the apparently contradictory implications of both preserving and changing, and eventually advancement (the German verb ''aufheben'' means "to cancel", "to keep" and "to pick up"). The tension between these senses suits what Hegel is trying to talk about. In sublation, a term or concept is both preserved and changed through its dialectical interplay with another term or concept. Sublation is the motor by which the dialectic functions.

Sublation can be seen at work at the most basic level of Hegel's system of logic. The two concepts ''Being'' and ''Nothing'' are each both preserved and changed through sublation in the concept ''Becoming''. Similarly, ''determinateness'', or ''quality'', and ''magnitude'', or ''quantity'', are each both preserved and sublated in the concept ''measure''.

Hegel's [[philosophy of history]] stresses the importance of negative (the antithesis) in history—negative includes wars, etc., but not only. His conception of historical [[progress (history)|progress]] follows a [[dialectic]] spiral, in which the thesis is opposed by the antithesis, itself sublated by the synthesis. Hegel stated that Aufheben is uniquely exempt from the historical process in that it is supposed to be true for all time and never changes or develops further as in ''das absolute Wissen'' ("[[absolute knowledge]]"). The synthesis both abolishes and preserves the thesis and the antithesis, an apparent contradiction which leads to difficulties in interpreting this concept (and to translate ''Aufheben'').{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In Hegel's logic, self-contradiction is legitimate and necessary.

For Hegel, history (like logic) proceeds in every small way through sublation. For example, the Oriental, [[Ancient Greeks|Greek]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Empires (in which the individual is ignored or annihilated, then recognized, and finally suppressed by the States) are preserved ''and'' destroyed in the [[First French Empire]], which, for Hegel, placed the individual in harmony with the State.

At the level of social history, sublation can be seen at work in the [[master-slave dialectic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hegel |first=Georg |title=The Difference Between the Fichtean and Schellingian Systems of Philosophy |date=1978 |publisher=Ridgeview Pub Co |location=New York |isbn=978-0917930126}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=December 2009}}

Hegel approached the history of philosophy in the same way, arguing that important philosophical ideas of the past are not rejected but rather preserved and changed as philosophy develops.

In Hegel's view, one can always find another thing in [[Human self-reflection|reflective philosophy]] upon which some "absolute" ground relies. With [[Fichte]]'s ultimate ground, the "I" or "[[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]", for example, one can immediately see the reliance upon the "non-I", which allows Fichte to distinguish what he means by the "I". Reflection is circular, as Fichte unapologetically acknowledged.

For Hegel, [[Human self-reflection|reflective thought]] is to be avoided due to its [[Circular definition|circularity]]. It leads to covering the same problems and ground ever and anon for each philosophical generation. It is a ''[[Perennial philosophy|philosophia perennis]].''

Instead, Hegel calls on [[speculative reason|speculative thought]]: two contradictory elements are held together, uplifted and sublated without completely destroying one another. Speculative thought seeks to avoid the [[idealism]] inherent in reflective thought and allows one to think in concrete terms about how things work, both in the present, real world and in history.

==Marx==

{{See also|Historical materialism}}

Marx identifies sublation as the manner in which [[materialism|material]], historical conditions develop. This is in stark contrast to the philosophical [[idealism]] of Hegel, for whom sublation reflects the agency of a specific ''[[Geist]]'' – a concept that has often been translated as "mind" or "spirit".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1947">In [[mathematics]], an '''axiom of countability''' is a property of certain [[mathematical object]]s (usually in a [[Category (mathematics)|category]]) that asserts the existence of a [[countable|countable set]] with certain properties. Without such an axiom, such a set might not provably exist.

==Important examples==
Important countability axioms for [[topological space]]s include:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Modern General Topology|series=North-Holland Mathematical Library|first=J.-I.|last=Nagata|edition=3rd|publisher=Elsevier|year=1985|isbn=9780080933795|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecvd8dCAQp0C&amp;pg=PA104}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[sequential space]]: a set is open if every [[sequence]] [[limit of a sequence|convergent]] to a [[point (geometry)|point]] in the set is eventually in the set
*[[first-countable space]]: every point has a countable [[neighbourhood system|neighbourhood basis]] (local  base)
*[[second-countable space]]: the topology has a countable [[base (topology)|base]]
*[[separable space]]: there exists a countable [[dense (topology)|dense]] subset
*[[Lindelöf space]]: every [[open cover]] has a countable [[subcover]]
*[[σ-compact space]]: there exists a countable cover by compact spaces

==Relationships with each other==
These axioms are related to each other in the following ways:
*Every first countable space is sequential.
*Every second-countable space is first-countable, separable, and Lindelöf.
*Every σ-compact space is Lindelöf.
*Every [[metric space]] is first countable.
*For metric spaces second-countability, separability, and the Lindelöf property are all equivalent.
 
==Related concepts==
Other examples of mathematical objects obeying axioms of countability include [[sigma-finite]] [[measure (mathematics)|measure space]]s, and [[lattice (order)|lattice]]s of [[countable type]].

'''''Black Gold''''' is a 2006 documentary film that follows the efforts of an Ethiopian coffee-union manager as he travels the world to obtain a better price for his workers' [[coffee bean]]s. The film was directed and produced by Marc James Francis and Nick Francis from [[Speakit Films]], and co-produced by Christopher Hird. It premiered at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/regionalfilm/southeast-news-brightonatsundance.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522132345/http://www.close-upfilm.com/features/regionalfilm/southeast-news-brightonatsundance.htm |archivedate=22 May 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film focuses on the coffee growers of the [[Oromia Region]] of southern and western [[Ethiopia]], the birthplace of coffee. It follows [[Tadesse Meskela]], the General Manager of the [[Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union]], as he visits coffee-growing regions in [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]] and Oromia (including the Kilenso Mokonisa Cooperative in the [[Bule Hora]] [[woreda]] in the [[Borena Zone]] of the Oromia Region), as well as a coffee processing center, a coffee auction house, and his union's headquarters in [[Addis Ababa]]. He also travels to England and the United States in an effort to promote Ethiopian coffee by eliminating the numerous middlemen. There is also a scene where coffee farmers pray to God for a higher price, which was filmed at the Negele Gorbitu Cooperative, located near [[Irgachefe]] in the [[Gelana Abaya|Abaya]] woreda of the Borena Zone. The Ethiopian coffee farmers speak about their lives, with one explaining that he is cutting down his coffee plants and planting ''[[khat]]'' (a plant containing [[cathinone]], an [[amphetamine]]-like stimulant) instead, due to the low price he is getting for coffee because of the explosion in the number of coffee farmers across the globe, and the comparatively higher price he can get for ''khat''.

The film also includes footage of the [[New York Board of Trade]], a [[commodity markets|commodity-trading]] floor in New York City, where the "C" international benchmark price of coffee is set each business day based on supply and demand, and explores the effects that these international prices (which by 2006 were at an all-time low) have on Ethiopian coffee growers. Other footage was shot at the first [[Starbucks]] and the [[World Barista Championship]] at the 2005 [[Specialty Coffee Association of America]] conference in Seattle; and at a café and the [[Illy]] coffee company in [[Trieste]], [[Italy]]. These scenes stand in stark contrast to the footage of the impoverished conditions faced by the Ethiopian coffee farmers and their families.

==Production==
In July 2003, Nick Francis  and Marc James Francis travelled to Ethiopia and started making the film. The meeting with Tadesse Meskela, the manager of Oromia Coffee Farmers Co-operative Union, was a decisive moment in the production of the film.&lt;ref name="Production notes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Production Notes|url=http://blackgoldmovie.com/production-notes|publisher=Speakit Films|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiring passion and determination of Tadesse, along with his continuous efforts to improve the lives of the farmers he represents, made Nick Francis and Marc James Francis decide much further in the production process to centre the film narrative around Tadesse's journey, his character functioning as a guide into the coffee world. The Ethiopian footage was filmed on two occasions (in 2003 and 2005), for six weeks each time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portafilter.net/2006/11/podcast-56-black-gold-movie.html |title=Podcast 56 - Black Gold The Movie |publisher=portafilter.net |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first shoot in Ethiopia, the crew flew to Cancun to document the meetings of the [[World Trade Organization]], where pivotal decisions that affect Africa's economy and development were being made in setting the trade rules and where the struggle for fairer international trade rules was played out. Unprecedented, that year developing countries refused to be forced into signing agreements that were against their interests, and the WTO talks completely collapsed. After the team's return to the UK, they spent the following months developing a rough cut of ''Black Gold''. During these months, the direction of the film took shape, along with the rest of the necessary shoots meant to develop the thrust of the narrative. In 2005, the team returned to Ethiopia for further shoots.

Although [[Starbucks]], [[Sara Lee (corporation)|Sara Lee]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Kraft Foods|Kraft]], and [[Nestlé]]—the world's largest sellers of coffee—are mentioned in the film, all five companies declined invitations to be interviewed for the film.&lt;ref name="Production notes" /&gt; By the end of 2005, the final cut of ''Black Gold'' was done and officially premiered during the 2006‘s edition of Sundance Film Festival.

==Music==
[[Andreas Kapsalis]], whom Marc James Francis and Nick Francis met during the Sundance Documentary Composers Lab, wrote the final soundtrack. In doing so, he used in part Mathew Coldrick's Ethiopian instrumental samples, recorded from Ethiopia. Joe Henson, Kunja Chatterton, and Mathew Herbert also contributed to the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soundtrack|url=http://blackgoldmovie.com/soundtrack|publisher=Speakit Films|accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==
In the first few weeks after the premiere, the film helped to generate donations approximately up to $25,000. The dilapidated school featured in the film was built.

Tadesse Meskela, the main character in ''Black Gold'', was able to increase the market price for his cooperative union's coffee. Tadesse Meskela was invited to 10 Downing Street, where he took his message directly to [[Tony Blair]].

After seeing the film, the UN have invited Tadesse to New York to do a presentation about his co-operatives at the 46th Session of the [[Commission for Social Development]].

''Black Gold'' was screened at the [[World Bank]] and [[European Union]], as part of debates about trade policy and development. The Ethiopian ambassadors based at Berlin, Washington, D.C., and London attended screenings.

''Black Gold'' was the first film to receive funding from BritDoc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kopp|first=Ingrid|title=Your Film Can Change the World|url=http://workingfilms.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/your-film-can-change-the-world.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203173950/http://workingfilms.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/your-film-can-change-the-world.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=3 December 2010|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Evans|first=Chris|title=Black Gold: storm in a coffee cup|url=http://www.screendaily.com/black-gold-storm-in-a-coffee-cup/4033053.article#|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate response to ''Black Gold''==
Since the first showing of ''Black Gold'' during Sundance, Starbucks sent people to screenings of the film in what has been called by one journalist "going on a charm offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carnevale|first=Rob|title=Black Gold - Marc and Nick Francis interview|url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/Film-Review/black-gold-marc-and-nick-francis-interview|publisher=indielondon.co.uk|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seager|first=Ashley|title=Starbucks stirred by fair trade film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jan/29/development.filmnews|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=29 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the film became more and more popular, Starbucks flew Tadesse and four other African coffee producers to their Seattle headquarters for a weekend conference, which was seen by many as a PR stunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ethiopian coffee farmer Tadesse Meskela Gudeta tastes Indonesian coffee Thursday at Starbucks' African Coffee Celebration|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/photo/Ethiopian-coffee-farmer-Tadesse-Meskela-Gudeta-904004.php|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siel|title=Black Gold: A Coffee Film That Has Starbucks Scared|url=http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/black-gold-a-coffee-film-that-has-starbucks-scared.html|publisher=treehugger.com|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, just before the film premiered at the London Film Festival in October 2006, a memo received by Starbucks staff from the headquarters leaked to the ''Black Gold forum''. The internal memo was sent out to inform all Starbucks employees that ''Black Gold'' was "incomplete and inaccurate".&lt;ref name="Forrest" /&gt;

'''Black pride''' is a movement in response to dominant white cultures and ideologies that encourages [[black people]] to celebrate black culture and embrace their African heritage.&lt;ref name="Tyson2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lois Tyson|title=Learning for a Diverse World: Using Critical Theory to Read and Write about Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eNe_wvUh3ewC&amp;pg=PA209|year=2001|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-8153-3774-4|pages=208–209|quote=Because the dominant white culture in America treated African Americans as subalterns rather than full American citizens and full human beings, the Black Pride movement encouraged black Americans to look to Africa for their cultural origins.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, it was a direct response to white [[Racism in the United States|racism]] especially during the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name="Glasker2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wayne C.

==Beauty and fashion==
Beauty standards are a major theme of black pride.

In the 1960s to 1970s, [[kente cloth]] and the Black Panthers uniform were worn in the U.S. as expressions of black pride.&lt;ref name="Hurst2015" /&gt; Headscarves were sometimes worn by [[Nation of Islam]] and other Black Muslim Movement members as an expression of black pride and a symbol of faith.&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt; Other women used scarves with African prints to cover their hair.&lt;ref name="Hurst2015" /&gt;

[[Maxine Leeds Craig]] argues that all-black beauty pageants such as [[Miss Black America]] were institutionalized forms of black pride created in response to exclusion from white beauty pageants.&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt;

===Brazil===
The black pride movement is very prevalent in [[Brazil]], especially throughout the poorer population, and it is found in the Brazilian [[funk]] music genre that began arose in the late 1960s, as also in [[funk carioca]], that emerged in the late 1980s. Both the origin of Brazilian funk and funk carioca reflects Brazilian black resistance. Ethnomusicologist George Yúdice states that youths were engaging black culture mediated by a U.S. culture industry met with many arguments against their susceptibility to cultural colonization. Although it borrows some ingredients from [[hip hop]], its style still remains unique to Brazil (mainly Rio de Janeiro and also São Paulo).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yúdice|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jamaica===
Black pride has been a central theme of the originally [[Jamaica]]n [[Rastafari movement]] since the second half of the 20th century. It has been described as "a rock in the face of expressions of white superiority."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/rastafari/history/slavery.shtml Rastafari and slavery]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The slogan has been used in the [[United States]] by [[African Americans]] to celebrate heritage&lt;ref name="Tyson2001" /&gt; and personal pride. The black pride movement is closely linked with the developments of the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Black Power movement]]&lt;ref name="Glasker2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vahistorical.org/collections-and-resources/virginia-history-explorer/civil-rights-movement-virginia/rising-black |title=Rising Black Consciousness |publisher=[[Virginia Historical Society]] |quote=As the civil rights movement gained ground, removing the stigma of inferiority not only in schools but throughout society, black pride increased. |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which opposed the conditions of the United States' segregated society, and lobbied for better treatment for people of all races.

'''Choice editing''' refers to the active process of controlling or limiting the choices available to consumers so as to drive to an end goal, specifically by [[ban (law)|banning things]] or imposing [[pigovian tax|punitive taxation]].  The term has gained currency in discussions about [[sustainability]].

==Definition==
The [[Sustainable Development Commission]] defined "choice editing" as "...shifting the field of choice for mainstream consumers: cutting out unnecessarily damaging products and getting real sustainable choices on the shelves."&lt;ref name=SDC2006&gt;
{{cite report
  |publisher=[[Sustainable Development Commission]]
  |url=http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/data/files/publications/Looking_back_SCR.pdf
  |title=Looking Back, Looking Forward: Lessons in Choice Editing for Sustainability
  |date=May 2006
  |page=2
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process involves "...[removing] environmentally offensive products from commercial consideration or [making] such products expensive to use."&lt;ref name=Maniates&gt;

  |first=Michael|last=Maniates
  |title=Editing out Unsustainable Behavior
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Choice editing is a direct control of the impact from consumption and aims to only provide sustainable products in the market. Not only products can be edited out or replaced, but also product components, processes and business models.&lt;ref name=WBCSD&gt;
{{cite report
  |publisher=World Business Council for Sustainable Development
  |title=Sustainable consumption facts and trends: from a business perspective
  |year=2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Choice editing is nothing new. It has been around through standards, [[tax]]es, [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]] that made certain products more desirable for consumers than others. The Sustainable Development Roundtable in 2006 announced that in the past choice editing was a major driver of “green” innovations, which suggests its potential to increase [[sustainable consumption]].&lt;ref name=WorldWatch2010&gt;

  |year=2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actors==
Governments and policy makers can edit citizens’ choices through laws, taxes, subsidies and voluntary bans. Businesses can edit choice by removing products from their range that might have negative impact on health or environment. Additionally, they can control their value chain and together with suppliers, processors and retailers develop solutions for more sustainable products and processes. A close collaboration along the value chain is important as the product’s environmental and social performance reflects the whole life cycle assessment. 

Retailers can actively "edit out" choices by not stocking products that they, or the state, consider to have an unacceptable environmental impact, thus being unsustainable options. Moreover, retailers can edit choice by requiring their suppliers to meet certain criteria.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

  |accessdate=June 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
; Editing by policy makers - light bulb ban
The [[Australia]]n government phased out [[incandescent light bulb]]s by 2010 as a step towards preventing possible electricity shortages and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They were replaced by [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s (CFLs) and [[LED lamp]]s. The expected consequences are reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 4 million tons per year from 2012. The [[European Union]] is following Australia’s example by removing all incandescent bulbs by 2012. Many other countries such as [[Canada]], the [[United States]] and [[Indonesia]] will do so as well.&lt;ref name=WorldWatch2010/&gt;

; Banning a product component – Henkel
[[Henkel]] took over the [[Brazil]]ian company Alba in 2006. Some of the company’s adhesive products contained toluene, which was misused by young people for [[Inhalant abuse|glue sniffing]]. After the takeover, Henkel developed a toluene-free formula and by 2007 introduced the toluene-free brand Cascola. 

; Editing the supply chain – Adidas
[[Adidas]] supports its suppliers in order to reduce their environmental impact by developing training materials, technical guidelines and workshop tailored to each supplier’s special need. 

This way Adidas actively edits the environmental impact of its supply chain.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;

; Editing processes – Tijin
Tijin is a Japanese company operating in the chemical industry. They edited their business processes by developing a recycling system for polyester. This reduces energy and resource use, CO2 emission and waste. Tijin established a global network with companies that collect polyester garments for recycling and support the expansion of products containing recycled polyester.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;

; Editing the corporate behavior - Hipp
As assessed by Belz and Peattie (2009), Prof. Dr Claus Hipp's philosophy of appropriate corporate behavior covering market, employees, the state and nature makes his baby foods company highly coveted by consumers. The company's ethics commission believes in economic fair play that can match the consumer's willingness to pay while processing the highest quality of organic raw materials that are sustainably grown. While many manufacturing companies' sustainability goals are towards the nature and the environment, Hipp takes a long-term ambition to survive in nature, as a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;

  |location=UK|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
An often raised ethical question in this matter is, whether consumers should choose freely or not. Should items be simply removed from their choices? Who decides what is removed and why? Some argue that instead of choice editing, labeling should provide information about the social and environmental performance of a product. Based on that, consumers are free to choose between sustainable and unsustainable products themselves.&lt;ref name=Maniates/&gt;

The opposite opinion is held by Tim Lang, professor of food policy at [[City University London]] and a prominent figure in Britain's food industry. In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist Leo Hickman, Lang argues that the consumer need not be bothered in the supermarket aisle to agonise over complex issues such as animal welfare, carbon footprints, workers' rights and excessive packaging, often without any meaningful data on the label to inform their decision-making. Lang instead suggested that the manufacturers and retailers should take more responsibility by making most of these decisions on consumer's behalf before the product even reaches the shelves. This would in turn allow the consumer to avoid endorsing products that are damaging to the environment as well as the society.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news
  |first=L.|last=Hickman
  |title=Does the consumer really know?
  |work=The Guardian
  |date=25 October 2007
  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/oct/25/ethicalliving.lifeandhealth1
  |accessdate=June 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Furthermore, there is still no agreement on who defines if a product is sustainable or unsustainable. Therefore, decisions made about the availability of a product can cause conflicts between the different actors like government, policy makers, businesses and consumers as they might have varying views concerning the sustainable or unsustainable nature of a product.&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt;

In [[biology]], '''constructive development''' refers to the hypothesis that organisms shape their own developmental trajectory by constantly responding to, and causing, changes in both their internal state and their external environment.&lt;ref name="Waddington1969"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Waddington|first1=CH|editor1-last=Waddington|editor1-first=CH|title=Towards a Theoretical Biology|date=1969|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|chapter=Paradigm for an evolutionary process}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewontin1983"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewontin|first1=RC|editor1-last=Bendall|title=Evolution from Molecules to Men|date=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|chapter=Gene, organism and environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oyama1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oyama|first1=S|title=The Ontology of Information: Developmental Systems and Evolution|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oyama2001"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Oyama|editor1-first=S|editor2-last=Griffiths|editor2-first=PE|editor3-last=Gray|editor3-first=RD|title=Cycles of Contingency: Developmental Systems and Evolution|date=2001|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noble2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noble|first1=D|title=The Music of Life|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gerhart|first1=JC|last2=Kirschner|first2=MW|title=The theory of facilitated variation|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA|date=2007|volume=104|pages=8582–8589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hallgrimsson2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallgrimsson|first1=B|last2=Hall|first2=BK|title=Epigenetics: Linking genotype and phenotype in development and evolution|date=2011|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructive development can be contrasted with programmed development, the hypothesis that organisms develop according to a genetic program or blueprint.&lt;ref name="Oyama1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laland|first1=KN|last2=Uller|first2=T|last3=Feldman|first3=MW|last4=Sterelny|first4=K|last5=Müller|first5=GB|last6=Moczek|first6=AP|last7=Jablonka|first7=E|last8=Odling-Smee|first8=FJ|title=The extended evolutionary synthesis: its structure, assumptions and predictions|journal=Proc R Soc B|date=2015|volume=282|page=20151019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constructivist perspective is found in philosophy, most notably [[developmental systems theory]], and in the biological and social sciences, including [[developmental psychobiology]] and key themes of the [[extended evolutionary synthesis]]. Constructive development may be important to [[evolution]] because it enables organisms to produce functional phenotypes in response to genetic or environmental perturbation, and thereby contributes to [[adaptation]] and diversification.&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Laland2015" /&gt;

==Key themes of constructive development==

===Responsiveness and flexibility===
At any point in time, an organism’s development depends on both the current state of the organism and the state of the environment. The developmental system, including the genome and its epigenetic regulation, responds flexibly to internal and external inputs. One  example is condition-dependent gene expression, but regulatory systems also rely on physical properties of cells and tissues and exploratory behavior among microtubular, neural, muscular and vascular systems.&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirschner|first1=M|last2=Gerhart|first2=J|title=The Plausibility of Life: Resolving Darwin’s Dilemma|date=2005|publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple modes of inheritance===
Organisms inherit (i.e., receive from their predecessors) a diverse set of developmental resources, including DNA, [[Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance|epigenetic marks]], organelles, enzymes, hormones, antibodies, transcription factors, symbionts, socially transmitted knowledge and [[Ecological inheritance|environmental conditions modified by parents]].&lt;ref name="Jablonka2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jablonka|first1=E|last2=Lamb|first2=MJ|title=Evolution in Four Dimensions|date=2005|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental environments are constructed===
In the course of development, organisms help shape their internal and external environment, and in this way, influence their own development. Organisms also construct developmental environments for their offspring through various forms of extra-genetic inheritance.&lt;ref name="Badyaev2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badyaev|first1=AV|last2=Uller|first2=T|title=Parental effects in ecology and evolution: mechanisms, processes and implications|journal=Phil Trans R Soc B|date=2009|volume=364|pages=1169–1177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributed control===
No single source of influence has central control over an organism's development.&lt;ref name="Oyama2001" /&gt; Whilst the genetic influence on development is fundamental, causation does not only occur from the bottom up, but also flows [[Downward causation|‘downwards’]]&lt;ref name="Ellis2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=GFR|last2=Noble|first2=D|last3=O’Connor|first3=T|title=Top-down causation: an integrating theme within and across the sciences?|journal=Interface Focus|date=2012|volume=2|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; from more complex levels of organismal organization (e.g., tissue-specific regulation of gene expression). The result is that many features of organisms are emergent properties that are not encoded in the genome.

==Mechanisms of constructive development==

Constructive development is manifest in context-dependent gene expression, physical properties of cells and tissues, exploratory behavior of physiological systems and learning.

===Context-dependent gene expression===
Although all the cells of an organism contain the same [[DNA]], there can be hundreds of different types of cells in a single organism. These diverse cell shapes, behaviors and functions are created and maintained by tissue-specific gene expression patterns and these can be modified by internal and external environmental conditions.

===Physical properties of cells and tissues===
Assembly of organs, tissues, cells and subcellular components are in part determined by their physical properties.&lt;ref name="Newman2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newman|first1=SA|last2=Müller|first2=GB|title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|chapter=Morphological Evolution: Epigenetic Mechanisms}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[cell membrane]] that forms a barrier between the inside and outside of the cell is a lipid bilayer that forms as result of the thermodynamic properties of the [[phospholipids]] it’s made of (hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tails).

===Exploratory processes===
Exploratory processes are selective processes that operate within individual organisms during their lifetimes.&lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005" /&gt; In many animals, the vascular, immune and nervous systems develop by producing a variety of forms, and the most functional solutions are selected for and retained, while others are lost. For example, the ‘shape’ of the [[circulatory system]] is constructed according to the oxygen and nutrient needs of tissues, rather than being genetically predetermined. Likewise, the [[nervous system]] develops through axonal exploration. Initially muscle fibers are connected to multiple neurons but synaptic competition selects certain connections over others to define the mature pattern of muscle innervation. The shape of a cell is determined by the structure of its [[cytoskeleton]]. A major element of the cytoskeleton are [[microtubules]], which can grow in random directions from their origin. Microtubule-associated proteins can aid or inhibit microtubule growth, guide microtubules to specific cellular locations and mediate interactions with other proteins. Therefore, microtubules can be stabilized in new configurations that give rise to new cell shapes (and potentially new behaviors or functions) without changes to the microtubule system itself.

===Learning===
In animals, many behaviors are acquired through learning. Social learning and cultural transmission are important sources of adaptive [[phenotypic plasticity]], enabling animals to adapt to their environments even if those environments have not frequently been encountered in the evolutionary history of the species. Social learning also enables stable inheritance of many characters. Cross-fostering of [[great tit]] and [[blue tit]] chicks show that social learning can result in stable inheritance of species-typical foraging behaviors (foraging height, prey type, prey size, foraging method) as well as nest site choice, alarm calls, songs, and mate choice.&lt;ref name="Slagsvold2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slagsvold|first1=T|last2=Weibe|first2=KL|title=Learning the ecological niche|journal=Proc R Soc B|date=2007|volume=274|pages=19–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Slagsvold2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slagsvold|first1=T|last2=Weibe|first2=KL|title=Social learning in birds and its role in shaping a foraging niche|journal=Phil Trans R Soc B|date=2011|volume=366|pages=969–977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[killer whale]] research has demonstrated the divergence of orcas into several species mediated by learned and socially transmitted differences in diets.&lt;ref name="Whitehead2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitehead|first1=H|last2=Rendell|first2=L|title=The Cultural Lives of Whales and Dolphins|date=2015|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructive development and evolution==

Within evolutionary biology, development has been traditionally viewed as under the direction of a genetic program (e.g.&lt;ref name="Mayr1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr|first1=E|title=The triumph of the evolutionary synthesis|journal=Times Literary Suppl|date=1984|volume=2 November|pages=1261–1262}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and metaphors such as genetic ‘blueprint’, ‘program’ or ‘instructions' are still widespread in biology textbooks.&lt;ref name="Moczek2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moczek|first1=AP|title=The nature of nurture and the future of evodevo: toward a comprehensive theory of developmental evolution|journal=Integrative Comp Biol|date=2012|volume=52|pages=108–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the constructive development perspective views the genome as a sub-system of the cell shaped by evolution to detect and respond to the signals it receives.&lt;ref name="Keller2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keller|first1=EF|title=From gene action to reactive genomes|journal=J Physiol|date=2014|volume=592|pages=2423–2429}}&lt;/ref&gt; These different perspectives affect evolutionary interpretations. One example is the evolutionary significance of environmentally induced phenotypes. [[Mary Jane West-Eberhard]] famously suggested that responses to the environment can be the starting point for evolutionary change,&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=West-Eberhard|first1=MJ|title=Developmental Plasticity and Evolution|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; termed ‘plasticity-led evolution’. From a programmed development perspective, developmental plasticity is considered to be controlled by genetically specified switches or reaction norms. For these   to produce functional responses to environmental change, their reaction norms must have been pre-screened by prior selection. Therefore, ‘plasticity-led evolution’ reduces to the standard evolutionary explanation of natural selection acting on genetic variation. Conversely, ‘plasticity-led evolution’ gains greater significance if development is constructive and open-ended. New functional phenotypes can emerge with little or no initial genetic modification (see [[facilitated variation]] and &lt;ref name="Gerhart2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirschner2005" /&gt;), and provide the new raw material on which natural selection can act (e.g.&lt;ref name="Lange2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lange|first1=A|last2=Nemeschkal|first2=HL|last3=Müller|first3=GB|title=Biased polyphenism in polydactylous cats carrying a single point mutation: the hemingway model for digit novelty|journal=Evol Biol|date=2014|volume=41|pages=262–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

{{Selfref|For geographical coordinates on Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Geographical coordinates]].}} --&gt;
[[File:3D Spherical.svg|thumb|300px|right|The [[spherical coordinate system]] is commonly used in ''physics''. It assigns three numbers (known as coordinates) to every point in [[Euclidean space]]: radial distance ''r'', polar angle ''&amp;theta;'' ([[theta]]), and azimuthal angle ''&amp;phi;'' ([[phi]]). The symbol ''&amp;rho;'' ([[rho]]) is often used instead of ''r''.]]
In [[geometry]], a '''coordinate system''' is a system that uses one or more [[number]]s, or '''coordinates''', to uniquely determine the position of the [[Point (geometry)|points]] or other geometric elements on a [[manifold]] such as [[Euclidean space]].&lt;ref&gt;Woods p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Coordinate System|urlname=CoordinateSystem}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of the coordinates is significant, and they are sometimes identified by their position in an ordered [[tuple]] and sometimes by a letter, as in "the ''x''-coordinate". The coordinates are taken to be [[real number]]s in [[elementary mathematics]], but may be [[complex number]]s or elements of a more abstract system such as a [[commutative ring]]. The use of a coordinate system allows problems in geometry to be translated into problems about numbers and ''vice versa''; this is the basis of [[analytic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Coordinates|urlname=Coordinates}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common coordinate systems==

===Number line===
{{main|Number line}}
{{anchor|Number line}} &lt;!-- [[Negative distance]] redirects here. I considered the main but this is better. Courtesy note per [[WP:SPECIFICLINK]]. --&gt;
The simplest example of a coordinate system is the identification of points on a line with real numbers using the ''number line''. In this system, an arbitrary point ''O'' (the ''origin'') is chosen on a given line. The coordinate of a point ''P'' is defined as the signed distance from ''O'' to ''P'', where the signed distance is the distance taken as positive or negative depending on which side of the line ''P'' lies. Each point is given a unique coordinate and each real number is the coordinate of a unique point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Stewart | first1=James B. | last2 = Redlin | first2 = Lothar | last3=Watson | first3=Saleem | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=College Algebra | publisher=[[Brooks Cole]]  | year=2008 | edition = 5th | pages=13&amp;ndash;19 | isbn=0-495-56521-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Number-line.svg|center|The number line]]

===Cartesian coordinate system===
{{main|Cartesian coordinate system}}
[[File:Cartesian-coordinate-system.svg|right|thumb|250px|The [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in the plane.]]
The prototypical example of a coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system. In the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], two [[perpendicular]] lines are chosen and the coordinates of a point are taken to be the signed distances to the lines. 
[[File:Rectangular coordinates.svg|left|thumb|250px]]
In three dimensions, three mutually orthogonal planes are chosen and the three coordinates of a point are the signed distances to each of the planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Moon P, Spencer DE |year=1988 |chapter=Rectangular Coordinates (x, y, z) |title=Field Theory Handbook, Including Coordinate Systems, Differential Equations, and Their Solutions |edition=corrected 2nd, 3rd print |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |pages=9–11 (Table 1.01) |isbn=978-0-387-18430-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be generalized to create ''n'' coordinates for any point in  ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

Depending on the direction and order of the coordinate axes, the three-dimensional system may be a [[right-hand rule|right-handed]] or a left-handed system.  This is one of many coordinate systems.
{{Clear}}

===Polar coordinate system===
{{main|Polar coordinate system}}
Another common coordinate system for the plane is the ''polar coordinate system''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Finney|first=Ross|author2=George Thomas |author3=Franklin Demana |author4=Bert Waits |title=Calculus: Graphical, Numerical, Algebraic|edition=Single Variable Version|date=June 1994|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Co.|isbn=0-201-55478-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A point is chosen as the ''pole'' and a ray from this point is taken as the ''polar axis''. For a given angle θ, there is a single line through the pole whose angle with the polar axis is θ (measured counterclockwise from the axis to the line). Then there is a unique point on this line whose signed distance from the origin is ''r'' for given number ''r''. For a given pair of coordinates (''r'',&amp;nbsp;θ) there is a single point, but any point is represented by many pairs of coordinates. For example, (''r'',&amp;nbsp;θ), (''r'',&amp;nbsp;θ+2π) and (−''r'',&amp;nbsp;θ+π) are all polar coordinates for the same point. The pole is represented by (0, θ) for any value of θ. 
{{Clear}}

===Cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems===
{{main|Cylindrical coordinate system|Spherical coordinate system}}
There are two common methods for extending the polar coordinate system to three dimensions. In the '''cylindrical coordinate system''', a ''z''-coordinate with the same meaning as in Cartesian coordinates is added to the ''r'' and ''θ'' polar coordinates giving a triple (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''θ'',&amp;nbsp;''z'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Margenau |first1=Henry |authorlink1=Henry Margenau |last2=Murphy |first2=George M. |year=1956 |title=The Mathematics of Physics and Chemistry |publisher=D. van Nostrand |location=New York City |page=178 |lccn=55010911 |isbn=9780882754239 |oclc=3017486}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spherical coordinates take this a step further by converting the pair of cylindrical coordinates (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') to polar coordinates (''ρ'',&amp;nbsp;''φ'') giving a triple (''ρ'',&amp;nbsp;''θ'',&amp;nbsp;''φ'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Philip M. Morse|Morse PM]], [[Herman Feshbach|Feshbach H]] | year = 1953 | title = Methods of Theoretical Physics, Part I | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | isbn = 0-07-043316-X | pages = 658 | lccn = 52011515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homogeneous coordinate system===
{{main|Homogeneous coordinates}}
A point in the plane may be represented in ''homogeneous coordinates'' by a triple (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'') where ''x''/''z'' and ''y''/''z'' are the Cartesian coordinates of the point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Introduction to Algebraical Geometry|first=Alfred Clement|last=Jones
|publisher=Clarendon|year=1912}}&lt;/ref&gt; This introduces an "extra" coordinate since only two are needed to specify a point on the plane, but this system is useful in that it represents any point on the [[projective plane]] without the use of [[infinity]]. In general, a homogeneous coordinate system is one where  only the ratios of the coordinates are significant and not the actual values.

===Other commonly used systems===
Some other common coordinate systems are the following:
* [[Curvilinear coordinates]] are a generalization of coordinate systems generally; the system is based on the intersection of curves.
** [[Orthogonal coordinates]]: [[coordinate surfaces]] meet at right angles
** [[Skew coordinates]]: [[coordinate surfaces]] are not orthogonal
* The [[Log-polar coordinates|log-polar coordinate system]] represents a point in the plane by the logarithm of the distance from the origin and an angle measured from a reference line intersecting the origin.
* [[Plücker coordinates]] are a way of representing lines in 3D Euclidean space using a six-tuple of numbers as [[homogeneous coordinates]].
* [[Generalized coordinates]] are used in the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] treatment of mechanics.
* [[Canonical coordinates]] are used in the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] treatment of mechanics.
* [[Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|Barycentric coordinates]] as used for [[ternary plot]]s and more generally in the analysis of [[triangle]]s.
* [[Trilinear coordinates]] are used in the context of triangles.

There are ways of describing curves without coordinates, using [[intrinsic equation]]s that use invariant quantities such as [[curvature]] and [[arc length]]. These include:
*The [[Whewell equation]] relates arc length and the [[tangential angle]].
*The [[Cesàro equation]] relates arc length and curvature.

==Coordinates of geometric objects==
Coordinates systems are often used to specify the position of a point, but they may also be used to specify the position of more complex figures such as lines, planes, circles or spheres. For example, [[Plücker coordinates]] are used to determine the position of a line in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Hodge
  | first = W. V. D.
  | authorlink = W. V. D. Hodge

  | isbn = 978-0-521-46900-5
  | origyear = 1947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is a need, the type of figure being described is used to distinguish the type of coordinate system, for example the term ''[[line coordinates]]'' is used for any coordinate system that specifies the position of a line.

It may occur that systems of coordinates for two different sets of geometric figures are equivalent in terms of their analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems in a case like this are said to be ''dualistic''. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the ''principle of [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Woods p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transformations==
{{See also|Active and passive transformation}}
{{main|List of common coordinate transformations}}
Because there are often many different possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures, it is important to understand how they are related. Such relations are described by ''coordinate transformations'' which give formulas for the coordinates in one system in terms of the coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') and polar coordinates (''r'',&amp;nbsp;''θ'') have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive ''x'' axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;cos''θ'' and ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;sin''θ''.

With every [[bijection]] from the space to itself two coordinate transformations can be associated:
* such that the new coordinates of the image of each point are the same as the old coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping are the inverse of those for the coordinate transformation)
* such that the old coordinates of the image of each point are the same as the new coordinates of the original point (the formulas for the mapping are the same as those for the coordinate transformation)

For example, in [[Dimension|1D]], if the mapping is a translation of 3 to the right, the first moves the origin from 0 to 3, so that the coordinate of each point becomes 3 less, while the second moves the origin from 0 to −3, so that the coordinate of each point becomes 3 more.

{{distinguish-redirect|Coordinate line|Line coordinates}}
{{distinguish-redirect|Coordinate plane|Plane coordinates}}

In two dimensions, if one of the coordinates in a point coordinate system is held constant and the other coordinate is allowed to vary, then the resulting curve is called a '''coordinate curve'''. In the Cartesian coordinate system the coordinate curves are, in fact, [[straight line]]s, thus '''coordinate lines'''. Specifically, they are the lines parallel to one of the coordinate axes. For other coordinate systems the coordinates curves may be general curves. For example, the coordinate curves in polar coordinates obtained by holding ''r'' constant are the circles with center at the origin. Coordinates systems for Euclidean space other than the Cartesian coordinate system are called [[Curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear coordinate systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mathematical Methods for Engineers and Scientists |volume=2|first=K. T.|last=Tang|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=3-540-30268-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure does not always make sense, for example there are no coordinate curves in a [[homogeneous coordinate system]].

[[File:Parabolic coordinates 3D.png|thumb|left|190px|Coordinate surfaces of the three-dimensional paraboloidal coordinates.]]
In three-dimensional space, if one coordinate is held constant and the other two are allowed to vary, then the resulting surface is called a '''coordinate surface'''. For example, the coordinate surfaces obtained by holding ρ constant in the [[spherical coordinate system]] are the spheres with center at the origin. In three-dimensional space the intersection of two coordinate surfaces is a coordinate curve. In the Cartesian coordinate system we may speak of '''coordinate planes'''.

Similarly, '''coordinate hypersurfaces''' are the {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional spaces resulting from fixing a single coordinate of an ''n''-dimensional coordinate system.&lt;ref&gt;

|first=Vladimir D.|last=Liseikin|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=3-540-34235-4|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coordinate maps==
{{main|Coordinate map}}
{{further|Manifold}}
The concept of a ''coordinate map'', or ''coordinate chart'' is central to the theory of manifolds. A coordinate map is essentially a coordinate system for a subset of a given space with the property that each point has exactly one set of coordinates. More precisely, a coordinate map is a [[homeomorphism]] from an open subset of a space ''X'' to an open subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Munkres, James R. (2000) ''Topology''. Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-181629-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often not possible to provide one consistent coordinate system for an entire space. In this case, a collection of coordinate maps are put together to form an [[atlas (topology)|atlas]] covering the space. A space equipped with such an atlas is called a ''manifold'' and additional structure can be defined on a manifold if the structure is consistent where the coordinate maps overlap. For example, a [[differentiable manifold]] is a manifold where the change of coordinates from one coordinate map to another is always a differentiable function.

==Orientation-based coordinates==
In [[geometry]] and [[kinematics]], coordinate systems are used not only to describe the (linear) position of points, but also to describe the [[orientation (geometry)|angular position]] of axes, planes, and [[rigid bodies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems |author1=Hanspeter Schaub |author2=John L. Junkins |chapter=Rigid body kinematics |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXvESNWrfpUC&amp;pg=PA71 |isbn=1-56347-563-4 |year=2003 |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, the orientation of a second (typically referred to as "local") coordinate system, fixed to the node, is defined based on the first (typically referred to as "global" or "world" coordinate system). For instance, the orientation of a rigid body can be represented by an orientation [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], which includes, in its three columns, the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of three points. These points are used to define the orientation of the axes of the local system; they are the tips of three [[unit vectors]] aligned with those axes.

[[Harold Kelley|Kelley]]'s '''covariation model''' (1967, 1971, 1972, 1973)&lt;ref&gt;also known as 'ANOVA model' (Kelley &amp; Michela, 1980:462)&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[attribution theory]] in which people make causal inferences to explain why other people and ourselves behave in a certain way. It is concerned with both [[social perception]] and [[self-perception]] (Kelley, 1973).

The covariation principle states that, "an effect is attributed to the one of its possible causes with which, over time, it covaries" (Kelley, 1973:108). That is, a certain behaviour is attributed to potential causes that appear at the same time. This principle is useful when the individual has the opportunity to observe the behaviour over several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;see also Kelley's discounting principle (1971, 1972): single observation&lt;/ref&gt; Causes of an outcome can be attributed to the person (internal), the stimulus (external), the circumstance, or some combination of these factors (Hewstone et al., 1973). Attributions are made based on three criteria: Consensus, Distinctiveness, and Consistency (Kelley, 1973).

==Consensus==

Consensus is the co-variation of behavior across different people. If lots of people find Lisa attractive, consensus is high. If only Arnab finds Lisa attractive, consensus is low. High consensus is attributed to the stimulus (in the above example, to Lisa), while low consensus is attributed to the person (in this case, Arnab).

==Distinctiveness==

Distinctiveness refers to how unique the behavior is to the particular situation. There is a low distinctiveness if an individual behaves similarly in all situations, and there exists a high distinctiveness when the person only shows the behaviour in particular situations. If the distinctiveness is high, one will attribute this behaviour more to the circumstance instead of person (Gilovich et al., 2005).

Referring to the example of Dr. Stanton's complimenting Barry's work, if Dr. Stanton almost never compliments other people's work, he shows high distinctiveness. But if he compliments everybody's work, this is low distinctiveness, and one will attribute the behaviour to the person, in this case, Dr. Stanton (Orvis et al., 1975).

==Consistency==

Consistency is the covariation of behavior across time. If Jane is generous all the time, she shows high consistency. If Jane is rarely generous or is generous only at specific times, perhaps around the holidays, she shows low consistency. High consistency is attributed to the person (Jane is a generous person), while low consistency is attributed to the circumstance (the holidays make people generous).

==Making attributions using consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency==

According to Hewstone and Jaspars (1987), we are able to determine whether a person would likely make a personal (internal), stimulus (external) or circumstantial attribution by assessing the levels of consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency in a given situation: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Low Consensus, Low Distinctiveness, High Consistency = Personal Attribution &lt;br/&gt;
High Consensus, High Distinctiveness, High Consistency = Stimulus Attribution &lt;br/&gt;
High Consensus, Low Distinctiveness, Low Consistency = Circumstance Attribution &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In reference to McArthur's study (1972), let us consider the following example: "John laughs at the comedian" This outcome could be caused by something in the person (John), the stimulus (the comedian) the circumstances (the comedy club on that night), or some combination of these factors (Hewstone et al., 1987).

If John is the only person laughing at the comedian (low consensus), he laughs at the comedian at other comedy clubs (high consistency), and he laughs at other comedians (low distinctiveness), then the effect is seen as caused by something in the person (John).

If everyone is laughing at the comedian (high consensus), John laughs at the comedian at other comedy clubs (high consistency), and he does not laugh at other comedians (high distinctiveness), then the effect is seen as caused by something in the stimulus (the comedian).

If everyone is laughing at the comedian (high consensus), John doesn't laugh at the comedian at other comedy clubs (low consistency), and he laughs at other comedians at the club (low distinctiveness) then the effect is seen as caused by something in the circumstance (the comedy club on that night).

==Causal schema==

A causal schema refers to the way a person thinks about plausible causes in relation to a given effect. It provides him or her with the means of making causal attributions when the information provided is limited. The three causal schemata recognized by Kelley are ''Multiple Sufficient Causes'', ''Multiple Necessary Causes'', and ''Causal Schema for Compensatory Causes'' (Kelley, 1973).

Multiple Sufficient Causes: He or she may believe that either cause A or cause B suffices to produce a given effect (Kelley et al., 1980). For example, if an athlete fails a drug test (effect), we reason that he or she may be attempting to cheat (cause A) or may have been tricked into taking a banned substance (cause B). Either cause sufficiently attributes to the effect (McLeod, 2010).

Multiple Necessary Causes: Both A and B are necessary to produce a given effect (Kelley et al., 1980). For example, if an athlete wins a marathon (effect), we reason that he or she must be very fit (cause A), and highly motivated (cause B) (McLeod, 2010).

Causal Schema for Compensatory Causes: The effect occurs if either A or B is maximally present, or if both A and B are moderately present. For example, success (effect) depends on high ability (cause A) or low task difficulty (cause B). Success will occur if either cause is highly present or if both are moderately present (Kelley 1973).

==Limitations==

Kelley's covariation model also has its limitations. The critique of the model mainly concerns the lack of distinction between intentional and unintentional behavior, and between reason and cause explanations (Malle, 1999).

Intentional behavior occurs when there is a desire for an outcome, together with a belief that a certain behavior will lead to the desired outcome. These beliefs and desires are mental states acting as reasons behind an intention to act. When behavior is unintentional, the behavior is not explained by reasons, but rather by cause explanations not related to mental states of desire and belief. Malle (1999) found that whether behavior is intentional or unintentional predicts the type of explanation, and that the type of explanation presented predicts the judgement of intentionality.

Malle (1999) also pointed at the differential effect of being an [[Actor-observer bias|actor versus observer]], the effect of the [[self-serving bias]] and the distinction between subjective and rational reasoning as important factors acting on attributions of behavior. This is not accounted for by the covariation model. Malle offers a new theoretical framework to give a broader and more comprehensive understanding of attributions of behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10532">'''Cyberformance''' refers to live theatrical performances in which remote participants are enabled to work together in real time through the medium of the internet, employing technologies such as chat applications or purpose-built, multiuser, real-time collaborative software (for example, [[UpStage]], Visitors Studio, the Waterwheel Tap, [[MOO]]s, and other platforms).  Cyberformance is also known as online performance, networked performance, telematic performance, and [[digital theatre]]; there is as yet no consensus on which term should be preferred, but cyberformance has the advantage of compactness. For example, it is commonly employed by users of the [[UpStage]] platform to designate a special type of [[Performance art]] activity taking place in a [[cyber-]]artistic environment.

Cyberformance can be created and presented entirely online, for a distributed online audience who participate via internet-connected computers anywhere in the world, or it can be presented to a proximal audience (such as in a physical theatre or gallery venue) with some or all of the performers appearing via the internet; or it can be a hybrid of the two approaches, with both remote and proximal audiences and/or performers.

==History and context==
The term 'cyberformance' (a [[portmanteau word]] blending 'cyberspace' with 'performance') was coined by the net artist and curator [[Helen Varley Jamieson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Online performances or virtual theatre has taken place in a number of the virtual environments that have emerged since the 1980s, including the multi-user virtual environments known as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s in the 1970s, internet chat spaces (e.g. [[Internet Relay Chat]], or IRC) in the 1980s, the [[The Palace (computer program)|Palace graphical chatroom]] in the 1990s, and [[UpStage]], Visitors Studio, [[Second Life]], Waterwheel Tap and other platforms in the 2000s. Notable cyberformance groups and projects thus far include:

* [[The Hamnet Players]]. Founded by [[The Hamnet Players|Stuart Harris]], this group performed in IRC; their earliest performance was "Hamnet" in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marmot.org.uk/hamnet/ The Hamnet Players]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Plaintext Players]]. Founded by [[Antoinette LaFarge]], this group performs in MOOs and mixed reality spaces; their earliest performance was "Christmas" in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yin.arts.uci.edu/~players/ The Plaintext Players]&lt;/ref&gt;
* "ParkBench." Created by Nina Sobell and Emily Hartzell in 1994, this was a collaborative performance and drawing space using live video and a web browser interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cat.nyu.edu/parkbench/ ParkBench]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Desktop Theater]]. Founded by Adriene Jenik and Lisa Brenneis, this group performed in the Palace; an example of their work is "waitingforgodot.com", 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desktoptheater.org/ Desktop Theater]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Avatar Body ''Collision''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avatarbodycollision.org/ Avatar Body Collision]&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Helen Varley Jamieson]], Karla Ptacek, Vicki Smith, and Leena Saarinen in 2002, this online performance collective uses [[UpStage]], a web-based software purpose-built for cyberformance with a New Zealand government grant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Features of cyberformance==
Cyberformance differs from [[Digital Performance|digital performance]], which refers to any kind of digitally mediated performance, including those with no significant networked element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The internet is often a subject and inspiration of the work as well as being the central enabling technology.

Cyberformers often work with the dual identities afforded by avatars, exploiting the gap between online persona and offline self.  They can also take advantage of the ease of switching between avatars in a way unavailable to 'proximal' actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The following criteria of violence or threat of violence fall outside of the definition of terrorism:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/dtra/terrorism_concepts.pdf Terrorism: Concepts, Causes, and Conflict Resolution], Jan 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azdema.gov/museum/famousbattles/pdf/Terrorism%20Definitions%20072809.pdf Various Definitions of Terrorism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319000454/http://www.azdema.gov/museum/famousbattles/pdf/Terrorism%20Definitions%20072809.pdf |date=2016-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many reasons as to why there is no universal consensus regarding the definition of terrorism. Angus Martyn in a briefing paper for the Australian Parliament has stated that "The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism. During the 1970s and 1980s, the [[United Nations]] attempts to define the term foundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of [[Wars of national liberation|conflicts over national liberation]] and [[self-determination]]."&lt;ref name=Martyn&gt;Angus Martyn, [http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm The Right of Self-Defence under International Law-the Response to the Terrorist Attacks of 11 September] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429023013/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/Pubs/CIB/2001-02/02cib08.htm |date=April 29, 2009 }}, Australian Law and Bills Digest Group, Parliament of Australia Web Site, 12 February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These divergences have made it impossible to conclude a [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]] that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Paniagua (2008),  p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the [[international community]] adopted a series of [[Definition of terrorism#The sectoral approach|sectoral conventions]] that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities. In addition, since 1994, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] has condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism: "Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance [[Theory of justification|unjustifiable]], whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them."&lt;ref&gt;1994 United Nations Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annex to UN General Assembly resolution 49/60 ,"Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism", of December 9, 1994, [https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r060.htm  UN Doc. A/Res/60/49]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study by Jeffrey Record for the [[United States Army]] quoted a source (Schmid and Jongman 1988) that counted 109 definitions of [[terrorism]] that covered a total of 22 different definitional elements.&lt;ref name="Record-p6-fn10"&gt;Record, p. 6 (page 12 of the PDF document), citing in footnote 10 Alex P. Schmid, Albert J. Jongman, et al., ''Political Terrorism: A New Guide to Actors, Authors, Concepts, Data Bases, Theories, and Literature'', New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction Books, 1988, pp. 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Record continued "Terrorism expert [[Walter Laqueur]] also has counted over 100 definitions and concludes that the 'only general characteristic generally agreed upon is that terrorism involves violence and the threat of violence.' Yet terrorism is hardly the only enterprise involving violence and the threat of violence. So does war, coercive diplomacy, and bar room brawls".&lt;ref name="Record-p6-fn11"&gt;Record, p. 6 (page 12 of the PDF document) citing in footnote 11: Walter Laqueur, ''The New Terrorism: Fanaticism and the Arms of Mass Destruction'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Terrorism2 london times 1-30-1795.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A 30 January 1795 use of the word 'terrorism' in ''[[The Times]]'', an early appearance in English. The excerpt reads: "There exists more than one system to overthrow our liberty. Fanaticism has raised every passion; Royalism has not yet given up its hopes, and Terrorism feels bolder than ever."]]
The term "terrorism" comes from French {{lang|fr|terrorisme}}, from {{lang-la|terror}}, "great fear", "dread", related to the Latin verb {{lang|la|terrere}}, "to frighten". The {{lang|la|terror cimbricus}} was a panic and state of emergency in Rome in response to the approach of warriors of the [[Cimbri]] tribe in 105 BCE. The French [[National Convention]] declared in September 1793 that "terror is the order of the day". The period 1793–94 is referred to as {{lang|fr|La Terreur}} ([[Reign of Terror]]). [[Maximilien Robespierre]], a leader in the [[French revolution]] proclaimed in 1794 that "Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible."&lt;ref&gt;Burgess&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Committee of Public Safety]] agents that enforced the policies of "The Terror" were referred to as "Terrorists".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.terrorism-research.com/history/early.php Early History of Terrorism], http://Terrorism-Research.com&lt;/ref&gt; The word "terrorism" was first recorded in English-language dictionaries in 1798 as meaning "systematic use of [[terror]] as a policy".&lt;ref name=com&gt;Harper&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Reign of Terror was imposed by the French government, in modern times "terrorism" usually refers to the killing of people by non-governmental political activists for political reasons, often as a public statement. This meaning originated with Russian radicals in the 1870s. [[Sergey Nechayev]], who founded the ''[[People's Reprisal]]'' (Народная расправа) in 1869, described himself as a "terrorist".&lt;ref name="Crenshaw77"&gt;Crenshaw, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; German radicalist writer [[Johann Most]] helped popularize the modern sense of the word by dispensing "advice for terrorists" in the 1880s.&lt;ref name="Crenshaw44"&gt;Crenshaw, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Myra Williamson]]: "The meaning of "terrorism" has undergone a transformation. During the reign of terror a regime or system of terrorism was used as an instrument of governance, wielded by a recently established revolutionary state against the enemies of the people. Now the term "terrorism" is commonly used to describe terrorist acts committed by ''non-state or subnational entities'' against a state."&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Williamson, Myra|title=Terrorism, war and international law: the legality of the use of force against Afghanistan in 2001|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7546-7403-0|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuJIPP9HfRsC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In international law==

===The need to define terrorism in international criminal law===
[[Ben Saul]] has noted that a "A combination of pragmatic and principled arguments supports the case for defining terrorism in international law",&lt;ref&gt;Ben Saul, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1292059 "Defining 'Terrorism' to Protect Human Rights"] in Sydney Law School Legal Studies Research Paper, No. 08-125 (2008) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; including the need to condemn violations to [[human rights]], to protect the [[State (polity)|state]] and deliberative politics, to differentiate public and private violence, and to ensure international peace and security.
 
Carlos Diaz-Paniagua, who coordinated the negotiations of the proposed United Nations [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], noted, on his part, the need to provide a precise definition of terrorist activities in international law: "Criminal law has three purposes: to declare that a conduct is forbidden, to prevent it, and to express society's condemnation for the wrongful acts.  The symbolic, normative role of criminalization is of particular importance in the case of terrorism.  The criminalization of terrorist acts expresses society's repugnance at them, invokes social censure and shame, and stigmatizes those who commit them.  Moreover, by creating and reaffirming values, criminalization may serve, in the long run, as a deterrent to terrorism, as those values are internalized."&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Diaz-Paniagua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Negotiating%20terrorism%3A%20the%20negotiation%20dynamics%20of%20four%20UN%20counter-terrorism%20treaties%2C%201997-2005&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997-2005''], City University of New York (2008) p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, international criminal law [[treaties]] that seek to prevent, condemn and punish terrorist activities, require precise definitions:

{{quote|The definition of the offence in criminal law treaty plays several roles.  First and foremost, it has the symbolic, normative role of expressing society's condemnation of the forbidden acts.  Second, it facilitates agreement.  Since states tend to be reluctant to undertake stringent obligations in matters related to the exercise of their domestic jurisdiction, a precise definition of the crime, which restricts the scope of those obligations, makes agreement less costly.  Third, it provides an inter-subjective basis for the homogeneous application of the treaty's obligations on judicial and police cooperation.  This function is of particular importance in extradition treaties because, to grant an extradition, most legal systems require that the crime be punishable both in the requesting state and the requested state.  Fourth, it helps states to enact domestic legislation to criminalize and punish the wrongful acts defined in the treaty in conformity with their human rights' obligations.  The principle of ''nullum crimen sine lege'' requires, in particular, that states define precisely which acts are prohibited before anyone can be prosecuted or punished for committing those same acts.&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Diaz-Paniagua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Negotiating%20terrorism%3A%20the%20negotiation%20dynamics%20of%20four%20UN%20counter-terrorism%20treaties%2C%201997-2005&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997-2005''], City University of New York (2008) pp. 46-7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saul noted in this sense that, missing a generally agreed, all-encompassing, definition of the term:
{{quote|'Terrorism' currently lacks the precision, objectivity and certainty demanded by legal discourse. Criminal law strives to avoid emotive terms to prevent prejudice to an accused, and shuns ambiguous or subjective terms as incompatible with the principle of non-retroactivity. If the law is to admit the term, advance definition is essential on grounds of fairness, and it is not sufficient to leave definition to the unilateral interpretations of States. Legal definition could plausibly retrieve terrorism from the ideological quagmire, by severing an agreed legal meaning from the remainder of the elastic, political concept. Ultimately it must do so without criminalizing legitimate violent resistance to oppressive regimes – and becoming complicit in that oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Saul, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1292059 "Defining 'Terrorism' to Protect Human Rights"] in Sydney Law School Legal Studies Research Paper, No. 08-125 (2008) p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Obstacles to a comprehensive definition====
Diaz-Paniagua has noted that, to "...create an effective legal regime against terrorism, it would be necessary to formulate a comprehensive definition of that crime that, on the one hand, provides the strongest moral condemnation to terrorist activities while, on the other hand, has enough precision to permit the prosecution of criminal activities without condemning acts that should be deemed to be legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;See Marsavelski, A. (2013) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2329401 ''The Crime of Terrorism and the Right of Revolution in International Law']' (In Chapter II.A.4., entitled "Criteria for the Use of Revolutionary Force", Marsavelski provides four guiding principles for distinguishing legitimate acts of freedom fighters from terrorist acts). (Connecticut Journal of International law, Vol. 28) at pp. 278-75.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, due to major divergences at the international level on the question of the legitimacy of the use of violence for political purposes, either by states or by self-determination and revolutionary groups, this has not yet been possible."&lt;ref&gt;C.F. Diaz-Paniagua, [https://books.google.com/books?id=q2qHd6a-slIC&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;dq=Negotiating%20terrorism%3A%20the%20negotiation%20dynamics%20of%20four%20UN%20counter-terrorism%20treaties%2C%201997-2005&amp;hl=es&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Negotiating terrorism: The negotiation dynamics of four UN counter-terrorism treaties, 1997-2005''], City University of New York (2008) p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense, [[M. Cherif Bassiouni]] notes:
{{quote|to define 'terrorism' in a way that is both all-inclusive and unambiguous is very difficult, if not impossible.  One of the principle difficulties lies in the fundamental values at stake in the acceptance or rejection of terror-inspiring violence as means of accomplishing a given goal.  The obvious and well known range of views on these issues are what makes an internationally accepted specific definition of what is loosely called 'terrorism,' a largely impossible undertaking. That is why the search for and internationally agreed upon definition may well be a futile and unnecessary effort.&lt;ref&gt;M. Cherif Bassiouni, "A Policy-oriented Inquiry of 'International Terrorism'" in: M. Cherif Bassiouni, ed., ''Legal Responses to International Terrorism: U.S. Procedural Aspects'', (Dordrecht, Boston and London: Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1988) xv – xvi.)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Sami Zeidan, a Lebanese diplomat and scholar, explained the political reasons underlying the current difficulties to define terrorism as follows:
{{quote|There is no general consensus on the definition of terrorism. The difficulty of defining terrorism lies in the risk it entails of taking positions. The political value of the term currently prevails over its legal one. Left to its political meaning, terrorism easily falls prey to change that suits the interests of particular states at particular times. The Taliban and Osama bin Laden were once called freedom fighters (mujahideen) and backed by the CIA when they were resisting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Now they are on top of the international terrorist lists. Today, the United Nations views Palestinians as freedom fighters, struggling against the unlawful occupation of their land by Israel, and engaged in a long-established legitimate resistance, yet Israel regards them as terrorists. Israel also brands the Hizbullah of Lebanon as a terrorist group, whereas most of the international community regards it as a legitimate resistance group, fighting Israel's occupation of Southern Lebanon. In fact, the successful ousting of Israeli forces from most of the South by the Hizbollah in 2000 made Lebanon the only Arab country to actually defeat the Israeli army. The repercussion of the current preponderance of the political over the legal value of terrorism is costly, leaving the war against terrorism selective, incomplete and ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;Sami Zeidan, Desperately Seeking Definition: The International Community's Quest for Identifying the Specter of Terrorism, 36 Cornell International Law Journal (2004) pp. 491-92&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the same vein, [[Jason Burke]], a British reporter who writes about radical [[Islamist]] activity, said:
{{quote|There are multiple ways of defining terrorism, and all are subjective. Most define terrorism as "the use or threat of serious violence" to advance some kind of "cause". Some state clearly the kinds of group ("sub-national", "non-state") or cause (political, ideological, religious) to which they refer. Others merely rely on the instinct of most people when confronted with innocent civilians being killed or maimed by men armed with explosives, firearms or other weapons. None is satisfactory, and grave problems with the use of the term persist. Terrorism is after all, a tactic. The term "war on terrorism" is thus effectively nonsensical. As there is no space here to explore this involved and difficult debate, my preference is, on the whole, for the less loaded term "Militancy". This is not an attempt to condone such actions, merely to analyse them in a clearer way.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke. ''Al Qaeda'', ch. 2, p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The political and emotional connotation of the term "terrorism" makes difficult its use in legal discourse. In this sense, Saul notes that: 
{{quote|Despite the shifting and contested meaning of "terrorism" over time, the peculiar semantic power of the term, beyond its literal signification, is its capacity to stigmatize, delegitimize, denigrate, and dehumanize those at whom it is directed, including political opponents. The term is ideologically and politically loaded; pejorative; implies moral, social, and value judgment; and is "slippery and much-abused." In the absence of a definition of terrorism, the struggle over the representation of a violent act is a struggle over its legitimacy. The more confused a concept, the more it lends itself to opportunistic appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Saul, ''Defining Terrorism in International Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Historically, the dispute on the meaning of terrorism arose since the [[laws of war]] were first codified in 1899. The [[Martens Clause]] was introduced as a compromise wording for the dispute between the [[Great Power]]s who considered [[francs-tireurs]] to be [[unlawful combatants]] subject to execution on capture, and smaller states who maintained that they should be considered lawful combatants.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 1 cites The life and works of Martens are detailed by V. Pustogarov, "Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845-1909) — A Humanist of Modern Times", ''International Review of the Red Cross'' (IRRC), No. 312, May–June 1996, pp. 300-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Ticehurst ([[#References|references]]) in hist footnote 2 cites  F. Kalshoven, ''Constraints on the Waging of War'', Martinus Nijhoff, Dordrecht, 1987, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently the 1977 [[Protocol I|Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts]], which applies in situations [[Protocol I#Part I GENERAL PROVISIONS|Article 1. Paragraph 4]] "... in which peoples are fighting against colonial domination and alien occupation and against racist regimes...", contains many ambiguities that cloud the issue of who is or is not a legitimate combatant.&lt;ref&gt;Gardam [https://books.google.com/books?id=MGT2hJFS9MkC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=in+which+peoples+are+fighting+against+colonial+domination+and+alien+occupation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=K_N1cgeQ2L&amp;sig=Mysj3VFtq3WBNFXpbpjqkbQpPao&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA91,M1  p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt;  
These difficulties have led Pamala Griset to conclude that: "the meaning of terrorism is embeded in a person's or nation's philosophy. Thus, the determination of the 'right' definition of terrorism is subjective." &lt;ref&gt;Griset, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YpmZ76zRW2oC&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;pg=PR13#v=onepage&amp;q=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false p. xiii].

====The sectoral approach====
To elaborate an effective legal [[International regime|regime]] to prevent and punish international terrorism—rather than only working on a single, all-encompassing, comprehensive definition of terrorism—the [[international community]] has also adopted a "...'sectoral' approach aimed at identifying offences seen as belonging to the activities of terrorists and working out treaties in order to deal with specific categories thereof".&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"&gt;Andrea Gioia, "The UN Conventions on the Prevention and Suppression of International Terrorism" in Giuseppe Nesi, ed., ''International Cooperation in Counter-terrorism: The United Nations And Regional Organizations in the Fight Against Terrorism'', p. 4 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The treaties that follow this approach focus on the wrongful nature of terrorist activities rather than on their [[intention (criminal law)|intent]]:

{{quote|On the whole, therefore, the 'sectoral' conventions confirm the assumption that some offences can be considered ''in themselves'' as offences of international concern, irrespective of any 'terrorist' intent or purpose. Indeed, the principal merit of the 'sectoral approach' is that it avoids the need to define 'terrorism' of 'terrorist acts' ... So long as the 'sectoral' approach is followed, there is no need to define terrorism; a definition would only be necessary if the punishment of the relevant offences were made conditional on the existence of a specific 'terrorist' intent; but this would be counter-productive, inasmuch as it would result in unduly restricting their suppression.&lt;ref name="autogenerated4"/&gt; }}

Following this approach, the international community has adopted the following sectoral [[counter-terrorism]] conventions, open to the [[ratification]] of all states:

* The 1963 [[Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed On Board Aircraft]]
* The 1970 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]]
* The 1971 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation]]
* The 1979 [[Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material]]
* The 1988 [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation]]
* The 1988 [[Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation]]
* The 1988 [[Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf]]
* The 1991 [[Convention on the Marking of Plastic Explosives for the Purpose of Identification]]
* The 1997 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings]].
* The 1999 [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism]]
* The 2005 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism]]

Analyzing these treaties, Andrew Byrnes observed that: 
{{quote|These conventions – all of which are described by the United Nations as part of its panoply of anti-terrorist measures – share three principal characteristics:

(a) they all adopted an "operational definition" of a specific type of terrorist act that was defined without reference to the underlying political or ideological purpose or [[motive (law)|motivation]] of the perpetrator of the act – this reflected a [[consensus]] that there were some acts that were such a serious threat to the interests of all that they could not be justified by reference to such motives;

(b) they all focused on actions by [[non-state actor]]s (individuals and organisations) and the State was seen as an active ally in the struggle against terrorism – the question of the State itself as terrorist actor was left largely to one side; and

(c) they all adopted a [[criminal law]] enforcement model to address the problem, under which States would cooperate in the [[arrest|apprehension]] and prosecution of those alleged to have committed these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes (2002), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Byrnes notes that "this act-specific approach to addressing problems of terrorism in binding international treaties has continued up until relatively recently. Although political denunciation of terrorism in all its forms had continued apace, there had been no successful attempt to define 'terrorism' as such in a broad sense that was satisfactory for legal purposes. There was also some scepticism as to the necessity, desirability and feasibility of producing an agreed and workable general definition."&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes (2002),  p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, since 2000, the United Nations General Assembly has been working on a proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]].

===Comprehensive conventions===
The [[international community]] has worked on two comprehensive counter-terrorism treaties, the [[League of Nations]]' 1937 Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of Terrorism, which never entered into force, and the [[United Nations]]' proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], which hasn't been finalized yet.

====League of Nations====
In the late 1930s, the [[international community]] made a first attempt at defining terrorism. Article 1.1 of the [[League of Nations]]' 1937 Convention for the prevention and punishment of Terrorism,&lt;ref&gt;League of Nations' 1937 [http://www.jur.uib.no/ansatte/joreh/temasider/internasjonalisering/Convention%20on%20terrorism%201937.pdf  Convention for the prevention and punishment of Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185446/http://www.jur.uib.no/ansatte/joreh/temasider/internasjonalisering/Convention%20on%20terrorism%201937.pdf |date=2011-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which never entered into force, defined "acts of terrorism" as "criminal acts directed against a State and intended or calculated to create a state of terror in the minds of particular persons or a group of persons or the general public". Article 2 included as terrorist acts, if they were directed against another state and if they constituted acts of terrorism within the meaning of the definition contained in article 1, the following:
{{quote|1. Any willful act causing death or grievous bodily harm or loss of liberty to:
:a) [[Head of state|Heads of State]], persons exercising the prerogatives of the head of the State, their [[Order of succession|hereditary or designated successors]];
:b) The wives or husbands or the above-mentioned persons;
:c) Persons charged with public functions or holding public positions when the act is directed against them in their public capacity.
2. Willful destruction of, or damage to, public property or property devoted to a public purpose belonging to or subject to the authority of another High Contracting Party.

3. Any willful act calculated to endanger the lives of members of the public.

4. Any attempt to commit an [[offence (law)|offence]] falling within the foregoing provisions of the present article.

====Proposed Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism====

Since 2000, the United Nations General Assembly has been negotiating a [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]]. The definition of the crime of terrorism, which has been on the negotiating table since 2002 reads as follows:
{{quote|1. Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person, by any means, unlawfully and intentionally, causes:
:(a) Death or serious bodily injury to any person; or
:(b) Serious damage to public or [[private property]], including a place of public use, a State or government facility, a public transportation system, an infrastructure facility or the environment; or
:(c) Damage to property, places, facilities, or systems referred to in paragraph 1 (b) of this article, resulting or likely to result in major economic loss, when the purpose of the conduct, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an [[international organization]] to do or abstain from doing any act.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, Sixth session (28 January-1 February 2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113112445/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement |date=13 January 2012 }}, Annex II, art. 2.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Among the negotiators, that definition is not controversial in itself; the deadlock in the negotiations arises instead  from the opposing views on whether such a definition would be applicable to the [[armed forces]] of a state and to [[self-determination]] movements. Thalif Deen described the situation as follows: "The key sticking points in the draft treaty revolve around several controversial yet basic issues, including the definition of ´terrorism´. For example, what distinguishes a "terrorist organisation" from a 'liberation movement'? And do you exclude activities of national armed forces, even if they are perceived to commit acts of terrorism? If not, how much of this constitutes 'state terrorism'?"&lt;ref&gt;Thalif Deen, [http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=29633 POLITICS:  U.N. Member States Struggle to Define Terrorism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611053853/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=29633 |date=June 11, 2011 }}, IPS 25 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  The coordinator of the negotiations, supported by most western delegations, proposed the following exceptions to address those issues:
{{quote|1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States, peoples and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and international humanitarian law.

2. The activities of '''armed forces''' during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention.

3. The activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, '''inasmuch as they are governed''' by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.

4. Nothing in this article condones or makes lawful otherwise unlawful acts, nor precludes prosecution under other laws.&lt;ref name="daccess-dds-ny.un.org"&gt;United Nations General Assembly, [http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement Report of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996, Sixth session (28 January-1 February 2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113112445/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N02/248/17/PDF/N0224817.pdf?OpenElement |date=13 January 2012 }}, Annex IV, art. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The state members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] proposed instead the following exceptions:
{{quote|2. The activities of 'the parties' during an armed conflict, 'including in situations of foreign occupation', as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention.

3. The activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, 'inasmuch as they are in conformity' with international law, are not governed by this Convention.&lt;ref name="daccess-dds-ny.un.org"/&gt;}}

===Sectoral conventions===
The various sectoral counter-terrorism [[treaty|conventions]] defines as terrorist particular categories of activities.

====Terrorist Bombings Convention====
Article 2.1 of the 1997 [[International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings]] defines the [[offence (law)|offence]] of terrorist bombing as follows:
{{quote|Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person unlawfully and intentionally delivers, places, discharges or detonates an explosive or other lethal device in, into or against a place of public use, a State or government facility, a public transportation system or an infrastructure facility:
:a) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or
:b) With the intent to cause extensive destruction of such a place, facility or system, where such a destruction results in or is likely to result in major economic loss.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorist Bombings Convention [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-9.pdf art. 2.1].
&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Article 19 expressly excluded from the scope of the convention certain activities of state [[armed forces]] and of [[self-determination]] movements as follows:
{{quote|1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States, and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, and international humanitarian law.
2. The activities of armed forces during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law, are not governed by this Convention, and the activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Terrorist Bombings Convention [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-9.pdf art. 19].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Terrorist Financing Convention====
Article 2.1 of the 1999 sectoral United Nations [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism]] (Terrorist Financing Convention) defines the crime of terrorist financing as the offence committed by "any person" who "by any means, directly or indirectly, unlawfully and wilfully, provides or collects funds with the intention that they should be used or in the knowledge that they are to be used, in full or in part, in order to carry out" an act "intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act."

====Nuclear Terrorism Convention====
The 2005 United Nations [[International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism]] defines the crime of nuclear terrorism as follows:
{{quote|Article 2
1. Any person commits an offence within the meaning of this Convention if that person unlawfully and intentionally:
(a) Possesses [[radioactive material]] or makes or possesses a device:
:(i) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily [[injury]]; or
:(ii) With the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the [[Natural environment|environment]];
(b) Uses in any way radioactive material or a device, or uses or damages a nuclear facility in a manner which releases or risks the release of radioactive material:
:(i) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or
:(ii) With the intent to cause substantial damage to property or to the environment; or
:(iii) With the intent to compel a natural or legal person, an [[international organization]] or a State to do or refrain from doing an act.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Terrorism Convention, [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-15.pdf art. 2].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Article 4 of the convention expressly excluded from the application of the convention the use of [[nuclear weapon]]s during [[armed conflict]]s without, though, recognizing the legality of the use of those weapons:
{{quote|1. Nothing in this Convention shall affect other rights, obligations and responsibilities of States and individuals under international law, in particular the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international humanitarian law.

2. The activities of [[armed forces]] during an armed conflict, as those terms are understood under international humanitarian law, which are governed by that law are not governed by this Convention, and the activities undertaken by [[military]] forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties, inasmuch as they are governed by other rules of international law, are not governed by this Convention.

3. The provisions of paragraph 2 of the present article shall not be interpreted as condoning or making lawful otherwise unlawful acts, or precluding prosecution under other laws.

4. This Convention does not address, nor can it be interpreted as addressing, in any way, the issue of the [[International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons|legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons]] by States.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Terrorism Convention, [http://treaties.un.org/doc/db/Terrorism/english-18-15.pdf art. 4].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Definitions of terrorism in other UN decisions===
In parallel with the criminal law [[codification (law)|codification]] efforts, some [[United Nations System|United Nations organs]] have put forward some broad political definitions of terrorism.

====UN General Assembly Resolutions====
A 1996 non-binding United Nations Declaration to Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, annexed to the UN General Assembly Resolution 51/210, described terrorist activities in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/51/a51r210.htm|title=A/RES/51/210.  Measures to eliminate international terrorism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.}}

[[Antonio Cassese]] has argued that the language of this and other similar UN declarations "sets out an acceptable definition of terrorism."&lt;ref name = "Cassese"&gt;Cassese (2002),  p. 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

====UN Security Council====
In 2004, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1566]] condemned terrorist acts as:
{{quote|criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of hostages, with the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a group of persons or particular persons, intimidate a population or compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act, which constitute offences within the scope of and as defined in the international conventions and protocols relating to terrorism, are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other similar nature.}}

====The High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change and the Secretary General====
Also in 2004, a [[High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change]] composed of independent experts and convened by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] called states to set aside their differences and to adopt, in the text of a proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], the following political "description of terrorism":
{{quote|any action, in addition to actions already specified by the existing conventions on aspects of terrorism, the Geneva Conventions and Security Council resolution 1566 (2004), that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to [[civilians]] or [[non-combatants]], when the purpose of such an act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a Government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/peacebuilding/pdf/historical/hlp_more_secure_world.pdf Report of the High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change "A more secure world: Our shared responsibility"] (2004) para. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The following year, Secretary-General of the United Nations [[Kofi Annan]] endorsed the High Level Panel's definition of terrorism and asked states to set aside their differences and to adopt that definition within the proposed comprehensive terrorism convention before the end of that year. He said:
{{quote|It is time to set aside debates on so-called "State terrorism". The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law. And the right to resist occupation must be understood in its true meaning. It cannot include the right to deliberately kill or maim civilians. I endorse fully the High-level Panel's call for a definition of terrorism, which would make it clear that, in addition to actions already proscribed by existing conventions, any action constitutes terrorism if it is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a Government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act. I believe this proposal has clear moral force, and I strongly urge world leaders to unite behind it and to conclude a comprehensive convention on terrorism before the end of the sixtieth session of the General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, Secretary General, Report of the Secretary-General ''In larger freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all''  [https://www.un.org/largerfreedom/chap3.htm Chapter 3] (2005) para. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The suggestion of incorporating this definition of terrorism into the comprehensive convention was rejected. Some [[List of United Nations member states|United Nations' member states]] contended that a definition such as the one proposed by the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, and endorsed by the Secretary General, lacked the necessary requirements to be incorporated in a [[criminal law]] instrument. Carlos Diaz-Paniagua, who coordinated the [[negotiation]]s of the proposed [[Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism]], stated that a comprehensive definition of terrorism to be included in a criminal law [[treaty]] must have "legal precision, certainty, and fair-labeling of the criminal conduct - all of which emanate from the basic human rights obligation to observe due process."&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Barnidge, ''Non-State Actors and Terrorism: Applying the Law of State Responsibility and the Due Diligence Principle'' 2007, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The [[European Union]] defines terrorism for legal/official purposes in Art. 1 of the ''Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism'' (2002).&lt;ref name = "StateWatch"&gt;[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2002/jul/frameterr622en00030007.pdf State Watch].&lt;/ref&gt; This provides that terrorist offences are certain criminal offences set out in a list consisting largely of serious offences against persons and property that;
{{quote|...given their nature or context, may seriously damage a country or an international organisation where committed with the aim of: seriously intimidating a population; or unduly compelling a Government or international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act; or seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a country or an international organisation.}}

===North Atlantic Treaty Organization===
[[NATO]] defines terrorism in the AAP-06 NATO Glossary of Terms and Definitions, Edition 2014 as "The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence against individuals or property in an attempt to coerce or intimidate governments or societies to achieve political, religious or ideological objectives".&lt;ref&gt;http://nso.nato.int/nso/zPublic/ap/aap6/AAP-6.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The now lapsed [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] specified the following definition of terrorism:

{{quote|Whoever with intent to overawe the Government as by law established or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people or to alienate any section of the people or to adversely affect the harmony amongst different sections of the people does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological or otherwise) of a hazardous nature in such a manner as to cause, or as is likely to cause, death of, or injuries to, any person or persons or loss of, or damage to, or destruction of, property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community, or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person in order to compel the Government or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act, commits a terrorist act.}}

===Pakistan===
The Pakistan Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Ordinance, 1999 states:

A person is said to commit a terrorist act if he,

(a) in order to, or if the effect of his actions will be to, strike terror or create a sense of fear and insecurity in the people, or any section of the people, does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive or inflammable substances, or such fire-arms or other lethal weapons as may be notified, or poisons or noxious gases or chemicals, in such a manner as to cause, or be likely to cause, the death of, or injury to, any person or persons, or damage to, or destruction of, property on a large scale, or a widespread disruption of supplies of services essential to the life of the community, or threatens with the use of force public servants in order to prevent them from discharging their lawful duties; or

===United States===
{{See also|Domestic terrorism in the United States}}

====U.S. Code (U.S.C.)====
Title 22, Chapter 38 of the United States Code (regarding the [[U.S. Department of State|Department of State]]) contains a definition of terrorism in its requirement that annual country reports on terrorism be submitted by the [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] to [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] every year. It reads:
{{quote|[T]he term 'terrorism' means [[premeditated]], politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2656f-|title=22 U.S. Code § 2656f - Annual country reports on terrorism|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Title 18 of the United States Code]] (regarding criminal acts and criminal procedure) defines international terrorism as:
{{quote|(1) [T]he term 'international terrorism' means activities that — 
:(A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the [[Criminal law of the United States|criminal laws of the United States]] or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States or of any State; 
:(B) appear to be intended — 
:: (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;
:: (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or 
:: (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, [[assassination]], or [[kidnapping]]; and 
:(C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2331-|title=18 U.S. Code § 2331 - Definitions|work=LII / Legal Information Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Commenting on the genesis of this provision, [[Edward Peck (American diplomat)|Edward Peck]], former U.S. Chief of Mission in [[Iraq]] (under [[Jimmy Carter]]) and former ambassador to [[Mauritania]] said:
{{quote| In 1985, when I was the Deputy Director of the Reagan White House Task Force on Terrorism, [my working group was asked] to come up with a definition of terrorism that could be used throughout the government. We produced about six, and each and every case, they were rejected, because careful reading would indicate that our own country had been involved in some of those activities. […] After the task force concluded its work, Congress [passed] U.S. Code Title 18, Section 2331 ... the US definition of terrorism. […] one of the terms, "international terrorism," means "activities that," I quote, "appear to be intended to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping." […] Yes, well, certainly, you can think of a number of countries that have been involved in such activities. Ours is one of them. […] And so, the terrorist, of course, is in the eye of the beholder.&lt;ref name="DemocracyNow"&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/07/28/1440244 Democracy Now] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060731140522/http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F07%2F28%2F1440244 |date=2006-07-31 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====U.S. Code of Federal Regulations====
The U.S. [[Code of Federal Regulations]] defines terrorism as "the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives" (28 C.F.R. Section 0.85).

====U.S. Department of Defense====
The [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] recently changed its definition of terrorism. Per Joint Pub 3-07.2, ''Antiterrorism,'' (24 November 2010), the Department of Defense defines it as "the unlawful use of violence or threat of violence to instill fear and coerce governments or societies. Terrorism is often motivated by religious, political, or other ideological beliefs and committed in the pursuit of goals that are usually political."

The new definition distinguishes between motivations for terrorism (religion, ideology, etc.) and goals of terrorism ("usually political"). This is in contrast to the previous definition which stated that the goals could be religious in nature.

====U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency====
The U.S. [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) contains a definition of terrorism, which reads:

{{quote|Terrorism is the use of force or violence against persons or property in violation of the criminal laws of the United States for purposes of intimidation, coercion, or [[ransom]]. Terrorists often use threats to:
* Create fear among the public.
* Try to convince citizens that their government is powerless to prevent terrorism.
* Get immediate publicity for their causes.}}

The new definition does not require that the act needs to be politically motivated. The FEMA also said that terrorism "include threats of terrorism; assassinations; kidnappings; [[hijacking (disambiguation)|hijacking]]s; [[Bomb threat|bomb scare]]s and [[bomb]]ings; [[cyber attack]]s (computer-based); and the use of [[chemical weapon|chemical]], [[biological weapon|biological]], [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]] and [[radiological weapon]]s" and also states that "[h]igh-risk targets for acts of terrorism include military and civilian government facilities, [[international airport]]s, large [[City|cities]], and high-profile [[landmark]]s. Terrorists might also target large public gatherings, water and food supplies, utilities, and corporate centers. Further, terrorists are capable of spreading fear by sending [[explosives]] or chemical and biological agents through the mail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1549-20490-0802/terrorism.pdf|title=Federal Emergency Management Agency — Terrorism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. National Counterterrorism Center====
The U.S. [[National Counterterrorism Center]] (NCTC) define terrorism the same as United States Code 22 USC § 2656f(d)(2). The Center also defines a terrorist act as a "premeditated; perpetrated by a sub-national or clandestine agent; politically motivated, potentially including religious, philosophical, or culturally symbolic motivations; violent; and perpetrated against a non-combatant target."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghri.org/GHR-International%20Definitions.htm|title=GHR International Definitions|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422010111/http://www.ghri.org/GHR-International%20Definitions.htm|archivedate=2009-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2002, the U.S. national security strategy defined terrorism as "premeditated, politically motivated violence against innocents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward P. |last=Halibozek |first2=Andy |last2=Jones |first3=Gerald L. |last3=Kovacich |year=2007 |title=The corporate security professional's handbook on terrorism |edition=illustrated |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=0-7506-8257-4 |page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qpwcHUNXw-kC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition did not exclude actions by the United States government and it was qualified some months later with "premeditated, politically motivated violence against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tom |last=Rockmore|first2=Joseph |last2=Margolis |first3=Armen |last3=Marsoobian|year=2005 |title=The philosophical challenge of September 11: Metaphilosophy |volume=35|number=3 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=1-4051-0893-2 |page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Crs1bGcjAp8C&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====USA PATRIOT Act of 2001====
The [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act of 2001]] defines domestic terrorism as "activities that (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or of any state; (B) appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S."

====Terrorism Risk Insurance Act====
Section 102(1)(a) of the [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]] contains a definition of terrorism in order for insurance companies to provide coverage to all prospective policy holders at time of purchase and to all current policyholders at renewal and requires that the federal government pay 90 percent of covered terrorism losses exceeding the statutorily established deductible paid by the insurance company providing the coverage. It reads:
{{quote|(1) ACT OF TERRORISM-
::(A) CERTIFICATION- The term 'act of terrorism' means any act that is certified by the [[U.S. Secretary of Treasury|Secretary [of Treasury]]], in concurrence with the Secretary of State, and the [[Attorney General of the United States]]--
:::(i) to be an act of terrorism;
:::(ii) to be a violent act or an act that is dangerous to--

::::(III) infrastructure;
:::(iii) to have resulted in damage within the United States, or outside of the United States in the case of--
::::(I) an air carrier or vessel described in paragraph
::::(5)(B); or
::::(II) the premises of a United States mission; and
:::(iv) to have been committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/fin-mkts/Documents/TRIAasamended-CompositeTextPost.pdf The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002(TRIA), as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005 (TRIEA) and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorizaton Act of 2007 (TRIPRA)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In general insurance policies==
Some insurance companies exclude terrorism from general property insurance (e.g. [[home insurance]]). An insurance company may include a specific definition of terrorism as part of its policy, for the purpose of excluding at least some loss or damage caused by terrorism. For example, [[RAC Insurance]] in Australia defines terrorism thus:
{{quote|
''terrorism'' – includes but is not limited to the use of force or violence and/or threat, by any person or group of persons done for or in connection with political, religious, ideological or similar purposes including the intention to influence any government and/or to put the public, or any section of the public, in fear.

==Social==
As [[Bruce Hoffman]] has noted: "terrorism is a pejorative term. It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore. (...) Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization 'terrorist' becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned. If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism. If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism."&lt;ref name="Hoffman-1998-p23"/&gt; For this and for political reasons, many news sources (such as [[Reuters]]) avoid using this term, opting instead for less accusatory words like "bombers", "militants", etc.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/citydiary/2735455/City-Diary.html  City Diary: Reuters sticks to the facts], City Diary, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 28 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=O6QTfAkk22AC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Definitions+of+terrorism&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Definitions%20of%20terrorism&amp;f=false pp. 28&amp;ndash;30]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline of political definitions==
Listed below are some of the historically important understandings of terror and terrorism, and enacted but non-universal definitions of the term:
&lt;!-- Listed oldest to newest --&gt;
* '''1795'''. "Government intimidation during the Reign of Terror in France." The general sense of "systematic use of terror as a policy" was first recorded in English in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/terrorism|title=Terrorism - Define Terrorism at Dictionary.com|date=|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1987'''. A definition proposed by Iran at an international Islamic conference on terrorism: "Terrorism is an act carried out to achieve an inhuman and corrupt ''(mufsid)'' objective, and involving [a] threat to security of any kind, and violation of rights acknowledged by religion and mankind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justresponse.net/defining_terrorism.html|title=JUST Response - Ayatollah Taskhiri - Definition of terrorism|date=|work=justresponse.net|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1988'''. A proposed academic consensus definition: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Terrorism is an anxiety-inspiring method of repeated violent action, employed by (semi-) clandestine individual, group or state actors, for idiosyncratic, criminal or political reasons, whereby - in contrast to assassination - the direct targets of violence are not the main targets. The immediate human victims of violence are generally chosen randomly (targets of opportunity) or selectively (representative or symbolic targets) from a target population, and serve as message generators.&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web

* '''2003'''. India: Referencing Schmid's 1992 proposal, the [[Supreme Court of India]] described terrorist acts as the "peacetime equivalents of war crimes."&lt;ref&gt;Schmid's definition of terrorism was adopted in a 2003 ruling (Madan Singh vs. State of Bihar); See http://www.sacw.net/hrights/judgementjehanabad.doc&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2005'''. [[United Nations General Assembly]]'s statement with relation to terrorism: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.{{cn|date=December 2017}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* '''2008'''. Carsten Bockstette, a German military officer serving at the [[George C. Marshall Center for European Security Studies]], proposed the following definition: "political violence in an [[asymmetrical conflict]] that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent [[victimisation|victimization]] and destruction of [[noncombatant]] [[Targeting (warfare)|targets]] (sometimes iconic symbols)."&lt;ref name=Bockstette2008&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bockstette, Carsten | year = 2008 | title = Jihadist Terrorist Use of Strategic Communication Management Techniques | issue = 20 | url = http://www.marshallcenter.org/mcpublicweb/MCDocs/files/College/F_ResearchProgram/occPapers/occ-paper_20-en.pdf | accessdate = 2009-01-01 | journal = George C.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any act carried out by an offender in furtherance of an individual or collective project, directly or indirectly, intended to disturb the public order of the state, or to shake the security of society, or the stability of the state, or to expose its national unity to danger, or to suspend the basic law of governance or some of its articles, or to insult the reputation of the state or its position, or to inflict damage upon one of its public utilities or its natural resources, or to attempt to force a governmental authority to carry out or prevent it from carrying out an action, or to threaten to carry out acts that lead to the named purposes or incite [these acts].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/02/06/saudi-arabia-terrorism-law-tramples-rights|work=Human Rights Watch| title=Saudi Arabia: Terrorism Law Tramples on Rights| first=Joe|last=Stork|date=February 6, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/saudi-arabia-new-terrorism-law-one-more-tool-crush-peaceful-protest-2014-02-03| work=Amnesty International|title=Saudi Arabia: New terrorism law is latest tool to crush peaceful expression|date=February 3, 2014|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Scholars and recognized experts on terrorism==
Numerous scholars have proposed working definitions of terrorism.  [[Bruce Hoffman]], a well-known scholar, has thus noted that:
{{quote|It is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism. Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus. In the first edition of his magisterial survey, "Political terrorism: A Research Guide," Alex Schmid devoted more than a hundred pages to examining more than a hundred different definition of terrorism in a effort to discover a broadly acceptable, reasonably comprehensive explication of the word. Four years and a second edition later, Schimd was no closer to the goal of his quest, conceding in the first sentence of the revised volume that the "search for an adequate definition is still on" Walter Laqueur despaired of defining terrorism in both editions of his monumental work on the subject, maintaining that it is neither possible to do so nor worthwhile to make the attempt. "Ten years of debates on typologies and definitions,"  he responded to a survey on definitions to conducted by Schmid, "have not enhanced our knowledge of the subject to a significant degree." Laqueur's contention is supported by the twenty-two different word categories occurring in the 109 different definition that Schmid identified in survey. At the end of this exhaustive exercise, Schmid asks "whether the above list contains all the elements necessary for a good definition. The answer," he suggests" is probably 'no'."  If it is impossible to define terrorism, as Laqueur argues, and fruitless to attempt to cobble together a truly comprehensive definition, as Schmid admits, are we to conclude that terrorism is impervious to precise, much less accurate definition? Not entirely. If we cannot define terrorism, then we can at least usefully distinguish it from other types of violence and identify the characteristics that make terrorism the distinct phenomenon of political violence that it is.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hoffman believes it is possible to identify some key characteristics of terrorism. He proposes that:
[[File:Iraq-terrorist attack on buses.jpg|thumb|The [[Baghdad]] bus station was the scene of a triple [[17 August 2005 Baghdad bombings|car bombing in August 2005]] that killed 43 people.]]
{{quote|By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime, we come to appreciate that terrorism is:
* ineluctably political in aims and motives;
* violent – or, equally important, threatens violence;
* designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target;
* conducted either by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) or by individuals or a small collection of individuals directly influenced, motivated, or inspired by the ideological aims or example of some existent terrorist movement and/or its leaders;
and
* perpetrated by a subnational group or nonstate entity.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside Terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;}}


A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]], underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:

{{quote|Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols). Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization. The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience(s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states.&lt;ref name=Bockstette2008/&gt;}}

In this sense, after surveying the various academic definitions of terrorism, Vallis concluded that:
{{quote|Most of the formal definitions of terrorism have some common characteristics: a fundamental motive to make political/societal changes; the use of violence or illegal force; attacks on civilian targets by 'nonstate'/'Subnational actors'; and the goal of affecting society. This finding is reflected in Blee's listing of three components of terrorism:
# Acts or threats of violence;
# The communication of fear to an audience beyond the immediate victim, and;
# Political, economic, or religious aims by the perpetrator(s).&lt;ref&gt;Rhyll Vallis, Yubin Yang, Hussein A. Abbass, [http://www.itee.adfa.edu.au/~alar/techreps/200611015.pdf Disciplinary Approaches to Terrorism: A Survey], University of South Wales, p. 7. For similar surveys see also: Hoffman, Bruce ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed. Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 34; and Alex Schmid, Statistics on Terrorism: The Challenge of Measuring Trends in Global Terrorism" in ''Forum on Crime and Society'', v. 4, N. 1-2 (2004) pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Academics and practitioners may also be categorized by the definitions of terrorism that they use. [[Max Abrahms]] has introduced the distinction between what he calls "terrorist lumpers" and "terrorist splitters."  Lumpers define terrorism broadly, brooking no distinction between this tactic and guerrilla warfare or civil war.  Terrorist splitters, by contrast, define terrorism narrowly, as the select use of violence against civilians for putative political gain.  As Abrahms notes, these two definitions yield different policy implications:
{{quote|Lumpers invariably believe that terrorism is a winning tactic for coercing major government concessions. As evidence, they point to substate campaigns directed against military personnel that have indeed pressured concessions. Salient examples include the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, the U.S. withdrawal from Lebanon in 1984, and the French withdrawal from Algeria in 1962. Significantly, terrorist splitters do not regard these substate campaigns as evidence of terrorism's political effectiveness. Rather, they contend that disaggregating substate campaigns directed against civilian targets versus military ones is critical for appreciating terrorism's abysmal political record.&lt;ref&gt;Abrahms, Max. "Lumpers versus Splitters: A Pivotal Battle in the Field of Terrorism Studies." Cato. http://www.cato-unbound.org/2010/02/10/max-abrahms/lumpers-versus-splitters-a-pivotal-battle-in-the-field-of-terrorism-studies/.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

|{{Dts|2004}}||&lt;span style="display:none"&gt;Hoffman, Bruce&lt;/span&gt;[[Bruce Hoffman]]|| "By distinguishing terrorists from other types of criminals and terrorism from other forms of crime, we come to appreciate that terrorism is :
* ineluctably political in aims and motives
* violent—or, equally important, threatens violence
* designed to have far-reaching psychological repercussions beyond the immediate victim or target
* conducted by an organization with an identifiable chain of command or conspiratorial cell structure (whose members wear no uniform or identifying insignia) and
* perpetrated by a subnational group or non-state entity.
We may therefore now attempt to define terrorism as the deliberate creation and exploitation of fear through violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political change. All terrorist acts involve violence or the threat of violence. Terrorism is specifically designed to have far-reaching psychological effects beyond the immediate victim(s) or object of the terrorist attack. It is meant to instil fear within, and thereby intimidate, a wider 'target audience' that might include a rival ethnic or religious group, an entire country, a national government or political party, or public opinion in general. Terrorism is designed to create power where there is none or to consolidate power where there is very little. Through the publicity generated by their violence, terrorists seek to obtain the leverage, influence and power they otherwise lack to effect political change on either a local or an international scale."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Hoffman, ''Inside terrorism'', 2 ed., Columbia University Press, 2006, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Depression''', a state of low [[Mood (psychology) |mood]] and [[Aversion therapy| aversion]] to activity, can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, tendencies, feelings, and [[subjective well-being |sense of well-being]]. A depressed mood is a normal temporary reaction to life events - such as loss of a loved one.  It is also a symptom of some physical diseases and a [[side effect]] of some drugs and medical treatments. Depressed mood may also be a symptom of some [[mood disorders]] such as [[major depressive disorder]] or [[dysthymia]].&lt;ref name="DSM-5(2013)"&gt;

=== Personality ===

=== Gender identity and sexuality ===

People who are marginalized due to either their gender identity or sexual orientation are more prone to depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plöderl|first1=M|last2=Tremblay|first2=P|title=Mental health of sexual minorities.

=== Medical treatments ===

Depression may also be the result of healthcare, such as with medication induced depression. Therapies associated with depression include [[interferon]] therapy, [[beta-blockers]], [[isotretinoin]], [[contraceptives]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rogers |first1=Donald |last2=Pies |first2=Ronald |title=General Medical Drugs Associated with Depression |journal=Psychiatry (Edgmont) |date=9 January 2017 |volume=5 |issue=12 |pages=28–41 |issn=1550-5952 |pmc=2729620 |pmid=19724774}}&lt;/ref&gt; cardiac agents, [[anticonvulsants]], [[antimigraine drug]]s, [[antipsychotics]], and [[Hormone therapy|hormonal agents]] such as [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Botts |first1=S |last2=Ryan |first2=M |title=Drug-Induced Diseases Section IV: Drug-Induced Psychiatric Diseases Chapter 18: Depression |url=https://www.ashp.org/DocLibrary/Policy/Suicidality/DID-Chapter18.aspx |pages=1–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Substance-induced ===
Several [[Substance abuse|drugs of abuse]] can cause or exacerbate depression, whether in [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], withdrawal, and from chronic use. These include alcohol, [[sedative]]s (including prescription [[Mood disorder#Substance-induced|benzodiazepines]]), [[opioid]]s (including [[Analgesic|prescription pain killers]] and illicit drugs such as heroin), [[stimulant]]s (such as [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamines]]), [[hallucinogen]]s, and [[inhalants]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition. |last=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2013 |isbn= |location=Arlington, VA |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychiatric syndromes ===
{{Main|Mood disorder#Depressive disorders|l1=Depressive mood disorders}}

A number of psychiatric syndromes feature depressed mood as a main symptom. The [[mood disorder]]s are a group of disorders considered to be primary disturbances of mood. These include [[major depressive disorder]] (MDD; commonly called major depression or clinical depression) where a person has at least two weeks of depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities; and [[dysthymia]], a state of chronic depressed mood, the symptoms of which do not meet the severity of a [[major depressive episode]]. Another mood disorder, [[bipolar disorder]], features one or more episodes of abnormally elevated mood, [[cognition]] and energy levels, but may also involve one or more episodes of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gabbard |first=Glen O. |title=Treatment of Psychiatric Disorders |edition=3rd |volume=2 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing |location=Washington, DC |page=1296}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the course of depressive episodes follows a seasonal pattern, the disorder (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, etc.) may be described as a [[seasonal affective disorder]].
Outside the mood disorders: [[borderline personality disorder]] often features an extremely intense depressive mood; [[Adjustment disorder|adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode;&lt;ref name="psychiatric355"&gt;{{cite book |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision: DSM-IV-TR |author=American Psychiatric Association |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. |location=Washington, DC |year=2000a |isbn=978-0-89042-025-6 |ref=CITEREFAmerican_Psychiatric_Association2000a}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|355}} and [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], a mental disorder that sometimes follows [[Major trauma|trauma]], is commonly accompanied by depressed mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vieweg |first1=W.

=== Historical legacy ===
{{main|Dispossession, oppression and depression}}
Researchers have begun to conceptualize ways in which the historical legacies of racism and colonialism may create depressive conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cvetkovich |first1=Ann |title=Depression: A Public Feeling |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press Books |location=Durham, NC |isbn=978-0822352389}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=William T.L. |last2=Abramson |first2=Lyn Y. |last3=Devine |first3=Patricia G. |last4=Hollon |first4=Steven D. |title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=427–49 |date=2012 |doi=10.1177/1745691612455204 |pmid=26168502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
Depressed mood may not require professional treatment, and may be a normal temporary reaction to life events, a symptom of some medical condition, or a [[side effect]] of some drugs or medical treatments. A prolonged depressed mood, especially in combination with other symptoms, may lead to a diagnosis of a psychiatric or medical condition which may benefit from treatment. The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that [[antidepressant]]s should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of '''mild''' depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/chapter/key-priorities-for-implementation NICE guidelines, published October 2009].

'''Domestic violence within lesbian relationships''' is the pattern of violent and [[coercive]] behavior in a female [[same-sex relationship]] wherein a [[lesbian]] or other [[non-heterosexual]] woman seeks to control the thoughts, beliefs, or conduct of her female intimate partner.&lt;ref name="bornstein"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bornstein | first1 = Danica R. | last2 = Fawcett | first2 = Jake | last3 = Sullivan | first3 = Marianne | last4 = Senturia | first4 = Kirsten D.  | last5 = Shiu-Thornton | first5 = Sharyne | title = Understanding the experiences of lesbian, bisexual and trans survivors of domestic violence: a qualitative study | journal = [[Journal of Homosexuality]] | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 159–181 | publisher = Taylor and Francis| doi = 10.1300/J082v51n01_08 | date = June 2006 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J082v51n01_08 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of multiple forms of domestic partner abuse, it is also referred to as '''lesbian battering'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violent Betrayal: Partner Abuse in Lesbian Relationships|last=Renzetti|first=Claire|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1992|isbn=|location=Newbury Park|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
{{further information|Domestic violence#Same-sex relationships}}
The issue of domestic violence among lesbians has become a serious social concern,&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Carolyn M. | title = Lesbian intimate partner violence: prevalence and dynamics | journal = Journal of Lesbian Studies, special issue: lesbian love and relationships | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–127 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1300/J155v06n01_11 | date = March 2002 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J155v06n01_11 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the topic has often been ignored, both in academic analyses and in the establishment of social services for battered women.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention'' states, "For several methodological reasons&amp;nbsp;– nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others&amp;nbsp;– it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between [[gay]] male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Bonnie S. Fisher, Steven P.

Hampton, Thomas P. Gullotta| title = Interpersonal Violence in the African-American Community: Evidence-Based Prevention and Treatment Practices| publisher =[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|year = 2010|page=49|accessdate = August 19, 2014| isbn = 0387295984 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=IAG1R-ZMmkYC&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt;

The issue of domestic violence among lesbian couples may be underreported due to the social construction of [[gender role]]s that women are expected to play in society; violence perpetrated by women may be ignored due to beliefs that the male social construction itself is a primary source of violence.&lt;ref name="terrance"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Little | first1 = Betsi | last2 = Terrance | first2 = Cheryl | title = Perceptions of domestic violence in lesbian relationships: stereotypes and gender role expectations | journal = [[Journal of Homosexuality]] | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 429–440 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/00918360903543170 | date = March 2010 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00918360903543170 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social construction of women is characterized as passive, dependent, nurturing, and highly emotional, and the social construction of men is characterized as competitive, aggressive, strong, and even prone to violence. Due to forms of [[discrimination]], [[homophobia]], and [[heterosexism]], and the belief that heterosexuality is normative within society, domestic violence has been characterized as being between the male perpetrator and the female victim.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; This contributes to the invisibility of all domestic violence perpetrated by women. Further, the fear of reinforcing negative [[stereotype]]s could lead some community members, activists, and victims to deny the extent of violence among lesbians.&lt;ref name="groscup"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = Michael J. | last2 = Groscup | first2 = Jennifer | title = Perceptions of same-sex domestic violence among crisis center staff | journal = Journal of Family Violence | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–93 | publisher = Springer | doi = 10.1007/s10896-008-9212-5 | date = February 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10896-008-9212-5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social service agencies are often unwilling to assist victims of domestic violence perpetrated by women.&lt;ref name="groscup"/&gt; Victims of domestic violence in lesbian relationships are less likely to have the case prosecuted within a legal system.&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = Diane Helene | last2 = Greene | first2 = Kathryn | last3 = Causby | first3 = Vickie | last4 = White | first4 = Barbara W. | last5 = Lockhart | first5 = Lettie L. | title = Domestic violence in lesbian relationships | journal = [[Women &amp; Therapy]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 107–127 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1300/J015v23n03_08 | date = October 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J015v23n03_08 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to overcome the denial of domestic violence in lesbian relationships, advocates for abused women often concentrate on similarities between homosexual and heterosexual domestic violence. The main goal of activists is to legitimize lesbian domestic violence as real abuse and validate the experience of its victims.&lt;ref name="miller"/&gt;

=== Other factors of unreliability ===
Literature and research regarding domestic violence in lesbian relationships is relatively limited, especially in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Many different factors play into this, such as "different definitions of domestic violence, non-random, self selected and opportunistic sampling methods (often organisation or agency based, or advertising for participants who have experienced violence) and different methods and types of data collected".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Irwin|first=Jude|date=2008|title=(Dis)counted Stories: Domestic Violence and Lesbians|url=http://0-qsw.sagepub.com.helin.uri.edu/content/7/2/199.full.pdf+html?|journal=Qualitative Social Work 7.2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes results to be unreliable, thus making it difficult to make general assumptions about the rates of lesbian domestic violence. This has caused rates of violence in lesbian relationships to range from 17 to 73 percent as of the 1990s, being too large of a scale to accurately determine the pervasiveness of lesbian abuse in the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since not all lesbians are open about their sexuality, large random samples are difficult to obtain and therefore are unable to show trends in the general lesbian community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research samples tend to be smaller, causing report rates of violence to be lower than they may be. This is "a consequence of the invisibility of such violence and fear of homophobic reactions".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Theoretical analysis of domestic violence in lesbian relationships is heavily debated. Popular approaches mainly discuss "the comparability of violence in lesbian and gay male relationships (same sex violence,) or draw on feminist theories of gendered power relations, comparing domestic violence between lesbians and heterosexual women".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some theorists also study same sex violence by defining gender as anatomy, and claim that gender is not relevant in any case of domestic violence due to its prevalence in same-sex relationships that is perpetrated as a form of homophobic behavior and occurs without consequence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other theorists argue that gay men and lesbians still internalize feminine and masculine behaviors, causing lesbians to "mimic traditional heterosexual relationships" and create blatant power dynamics between dominant and submissive partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Forms ==

The scope of domestic violence among lesbian relationships displays the pattern of intimidation, coercion, terrorism, or violence that achieves enhanced power and control for the perpetrator over her partner.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt; The forms of domestic violence in lesbian relationships include physical abuse, such as hitting, choking, using weapons, or restraining, often referred to as "battering"; emotional abuse, such as lying, neglecting, and degrading; intimidation threats, such as threats to harm the victim, their family, or their pets; sexual abuse, such as forcing sex or refusing safe sex; destruction of property, such as vandalizing the home and damaging furniture, clothing, or personal objects; economic, such as controlling the victim's money and forcing financial dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bimbi | first1 = David S. | last2 = Palmadessa | first2 = Nancy A. | last3 = Parsons | first3 = Jeffrey T. | title = Substance use and domestic violence among urban gays, lesbians and bisexuals | journal = Journal of LGBT Health Research | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 1–7 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1300/J463v03n02_01 | date = 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J463v03n02_01 | ref= harv | postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, psychological abuse was found to be common among lesbian victims. Findings from studies have shown that slapping was most the commonly reported form of abuse, while beatings and assaults with weapons were less frequent.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; Sexual violence within lesbian relationships was found to be as high as 55%. The most frequent type included forced kissing, breast, and genital fondling, and oral, anal, or vaginal penetration. Eighty percent of victims reported psychological abuse and verbal abuse. Lesbians are also less likely to use physical force or threats than gay men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women-Identified Women|last=Darty|first=Trudy|last2=Potter|first2=Sandee|publisher=Mayfield|year=1984|isbn=|location=Palo Alto|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

===General===
Factors that contribute to domestic violence include the belief that abuse (physical or verbal) is acceptable, substance abuse, unemployment, mental health problems, lack of coping skills, isolation, and excessive dependence on the abuser.&lt;ref name="Newman p. 11"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Newman | first1 = Willis C. | last2 = Newman | first2 = Esmeralda | contribution = What is domestic violence? (What causes domestic violence?) | editor-last1 = Newman | editor-first1 = Willis C. | editor-last2 = Newman | editor-first2 = Esmeralda | title = Domestic violence: causes and cures and anger management | page = 11 | publisher = Newman International LLC | location = Tacoma, Washington | year = 2008 | isbn = 9781452843230 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c1_9nzCi4W0C&amp;pg=PA11 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151022142356/https://books.google.com/books?id=c1_9nzCi4W0C&amp;pg=PA11 | archivedate = 2015-10-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors specific to lesbian relationships such as emotional isolation and lack of community ties due to heterosexism and homophobia, [[minority stress]], and the re-victimization of women who have previously suffered abuse also provoke the causes of domestic violence in lesbian relationships.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; The political context of homophobia and heterosexism is essential for understanding the experience of lesbian victims of domestic violence. Also homophobia is an important factor in shaping the experience of domestic violence in lesbian relationships.&lt;ref name="bornstein" /&gt; For instance, mental health agencies still contain homophobic and heterosexual beliefs which limit the extent of the services provided to the victims.&lt;ref name="groscup" /&gt; These victims experience violence within the context of a world that is not only misogynistic but is also homophobic.&lt;ref name="bornstein" /&gt;

=== Stigma towards lesbians ===
Lesbian couples frequently experience [[Sexual stigma|social stigma]] against them, including experiences of discrimination and bias against them, as well as other minority stress factors which can include the fear of [[outing]], [[internalized homophobia]], the butch/femme identity, and relationship quality.&lt;ref name="balsam"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Balsam | first1 = Kimberly F. | last2 = Szymanski | first2 = Dawn M. | title = Relationship quality and domestic violence in women's same-sex relationships: the role of minority stress | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 258–269 | publisher = Sage | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00220.x | date = September 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00220.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Internalized homophobia  ===
A perpetrator may use her partner's internalized homophobia to justify her own violence. This may cause a general distaste or negative conception of the lesbian identity, both of oneself and others. This behavior is described as horizontal hostility, or minority groups becoming hostile or violent toward each other.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homophobia: A Weapon of Sexism|last=Pharr|first=Suzanne|publisher=Chardon|year=1988|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from both finding it easier to direct hatred toward other oppressed groups and internalized homophobia and misogyny. In the case of domestic violence in lesbian relationships, this hostility is perpetuated in the form of intimate partner abuse.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In some cases, the lesbian community can dismiss cases of domestic violence in lesbian relationships or shame victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Naming the Violence: Speaking Out About Lesbian Battering|last=Lobel|first=Kerry|publisher=Seal|year=1986|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contributes to low self-esteem, feelings of powerlessness, denial of group membership, and difficulty being in committed and trusting relationships. These negative feelings are then acted out in the form of lesbian battering. Also women fear that they might suffer from isolation, risk of losing their job, housing or family as consequences to homophobia and internalized homophobia.&lt;ref name="bornstein" /&gt; A woman who abuses her female partner can use homophobic control as a method of psychological abuse, which further isolates the victim.&lt;ref name="west" /&gt; For example, an abuser may out her partner without permission by revealing her sexual orientation to others, including relatives, employers, and landlords, and in child custody cases. This form of abuse could result in a variety of negative consequences for the victim, such as being shunned by family members and the loss of children, a job, and housing. In fearing isolation due to homophobia, lesbians also experience the phenomenon of living in the "second closet", or that they must keep both their sexualities and experiences with domestic violence hidden from others due to fear of negative repercussions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These homophobic roots also integrate themselves into how lesbians raise their children.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lesbian Couples: Creating Healthy Relationships for the '90's|last=Clunis|first=Merilee|last2=Green|first2=Dorsey|publisher=Seal|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Past experiences with domestic violence and abuse ===
Many lesbians who are either battered or batter have had experience with domestic violence and sexual assault, often familial or as a child, including beatings, incest, molestation, and verbal abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In growing up in living situations where violence is "normalized", the partner often does not label the problem or recognize that the violence within the relationship is an issue. This can also translate into how the couple raise potential children and implement discipline.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Power and control ===
{{See also|Abusive power and control}}
Domestic violence in lesbian relationships happens for many reasons. Domestic violence can occur due to control. Violence is most frequently employed as a tactic for achieving interpersonal power or control over their partner.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt; Also perceived loss of power or control may also lead to increased violence within the relationship. The alienation and isolation imposed by internalized and external oppression may construct loss of control, and the need to reclaim it becomes the central concern for lesbians. Lesbians may be denied control over numerous aspects of their lives.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, if she remains in the closet, she is also denied control, subjected to continuous self-monitoring, and forced to deal with stress so that she could hide her identity and her intimate relationship from the eyes of others. The perpetrator of violence in an intimate relationship can also threaten their partner to abduct their children if only one has legal custody of their children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On the contrary, there have also been cases of lesbians and lesbian couples that become ''guardian ad litems'' and households that have been licensed to provide temporary foster care for children that are vulnerable to domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Power and control take advantage the most intimate parts of lesbian relationships, including sex life and the individual agency of the victim in the relationship.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Dependency and self-esteem factors ===
Another reason why domestic violence can occur is dependency.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt; The need to achieve balance between separateness and connection has been identified as the primary task in relationships, and is a specifically frequent problem in lesbian relationships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The degree of dependence on a relationship and on one's intimate partner causes abuse. Lesbians who report more frequent use of violent tactics in conflict with their partner will report a higher level of dependency as a personality trait.

Dependency in lesbian relationships is also a result of female-specific socialization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since women have been socialized for "togetherness" and cooperative living, women often struggle with balancing social life and being alone. A study found that lesbians are more likely to spend free time at home than homosexual men are.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In lesbian relationships, women often find it difficult to spend time apart because they feel pressured to take care of one another. Women may assume that spending time away from their partner would make them upset or angry. Without proper communication, improper management of time may lead to unhealthy discourse within a relationship, and partner equality remains difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Self-esteem]] is another underlying factor of domestic abuse. Low self-esteem and a negative self-image are qualities that characterize both perpetrators and victims of heterosexual domestic violence. The jealousy and the possessiveness that are frequently linked to battering behavior are associated with problems of low self-esteem and negative self-concept. Lesbians who report more frequent use of violent tactics in conflicts with their partners will report a lower level of self-esteem as a personality trait.&lt;ref name="miller" /&gt;

== Erasure of homosexuality in domestic violence shelters ==
Domestic violence shelters also provide heterocentric services for battered women, which further isolates battered lesbians and silences the pervasiveness of domestic violence in lesbian relationships. The perpetrator of violence in an abusive relationship is often assumed to be male, while the victim of the violence is assumed to be straight.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These services can be improved by ensuring that the case statement of an agency unit is LGBTQ friendly, providing training services for faculty and staff at shelters, making sure that all services does not have heterosexist language, and providing opportunities for lesbians to take leadership positions in these endeavors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In [[computing]], an '''effect system''' is a [[formal system]] which describes the computational effects of computer programs, such as [[side effect (computer science)|side effect]]s. An effect system can be used to provide a compile-time check of the possible effects of the program.

The effect system extends the notion of type to have an "effect" component, which comprises an '''effect kind''' and a '''region'''. The effect kind describes ''what'' is being done, and the region describes ''with what'' it is being done.

An effect system is typically an extension of a [[type system]]. The term "type and effect system" is sometimes used in this case. Often, a type of a value is denoted together with its effect as ''type ! effect'', where both the type component and the effect component mention certain regions (for example, a type of a mutable memory cell is parameterized by the label of the memory region in which the cell resides).

Some examples of the behaviors that can be described by effect systems include:
* Reading, writing or allocating memory: the effect kind is ''read'', ''write'', ''allocate'' or ''free'', and the region is the point of the program where allocation was performed (i.e., each program point where allocation is performed is assigned a unique label, and region information is statically propagated along the dataflow). Most functions working with memory will actually be polymorphic in the region variable: for example, a function that swaps two locations in memory will have type {{code|forall r1 r2, unit ! {{mset|read r1, read r2, write r1, write r2}}}}.
* Working with resources, such as files: for example, the effect kind may be ''open'', ''read'' and ''close'', and again, the region is the point of the program where the resource is opened.
* Control transfers with continuations and long jumps: the effect kind may be ''[[goto]]'' (i.e. the piece of code may perform a jump) and ''[[comefrom]]'' (i.e. the piece of code may be the target of a jump), and the region denotes the point of the program from which or to which the jump may be performed.
* Java's [[checked exception]]s are an example of an effect system: the effect kind is ''throws'' and the region is the type of the exception being thrown.

Effect systems may be used to prove the external purity of certain internally impure definitions: for example, if a function internally allocates and modifies a region of memory, but the function's type does not mention the region, then the corresponding effect may be erased from the function's effect.

'''Elder rights''' are the [[rights]] of the aged, who in the [[United States]] are not recognized as a constitutionally [[protected class]].&lt;ref name=mitchellreview&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kohn|first1=Nina|title=The Lawyer's Role in Fostering an Elder Rights Movement|journal=William Mitchell Law Review|date=2010|volume=37|page=51|url=http://web.wmitchell.edu/law-review/wp-content/uploads/Volume37/documents/Kohn.pdf|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Common rights issues faced by elders include age-related job [[discrimination]] (such as forced age of retirement), lack of access to medical treatments because of age or age-related obstacles, societal perceptions of ability/disability due to age,&lt;ref name="mitchellreview"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and vulnerability to abuse, including financial, physical, psychological, social, and sexual&lt;ref name=srv&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Rights – Elder Abuse|url=http://seniorsrights.org.au/your-rights/|website=Senior Rights Victoria|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of diminished capacity and lack of access to/ability to use technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protecting Elders' Rights|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/caringforyourparents/handbook/legalissues/protectingeldersrights.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elder rights movement==
The concept of a unique set of needs and rights of the elderly started in 1930s during the [[Great Depression]] with the main focus being on the need for a national pension program to provide financial security to the no longer working elderly.&lt;ref name=walls&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walls|first1=David|title=Elders Rights Movement|url=http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/elders-rights-movement.shtml|publisher=Sonoma State University|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous rival plans (the [[Townsend Plan]], the [[McClain Movement]], the [[Ham and Eggs Movement]]) were made to address the issue.  Eventually, as part of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], the [[Social Security Act]] was passed to meet the need.

As the [[population ageing|population aged]] and the aged grew wealthier throughout the second half of the twentieth century, their political influence increased.&lt;ref name='walls'&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as the [[American Association of Retired Persons]] and government bodies such as the [[Administration on Aging]] were created to meet their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pratt|first1=Henry|title=The Gray Lobby: Politics of Old Age|date=1976|publisher=University of Chicago Press|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues far beyond simple financial security became the focus{{snd}}[[Maggie Kuhn]], angered over her mandatory retirement at 65, launched the [[Gray Panthers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laursen|first1=Eric|title=Gray Panthers|url=http://www.globalaging.org/elderrights/us/2009/panthers.htm|website=Global Action on Aging|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Elder Law Foundation]] was created out of concern that elderly might have unique legal needs.&lt;ref name="nelf"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 reauthorization of the [[Older Americans Act]] included a project called [[Choices for Independence]] to develop consumer-directed community-based (as opposed to congregate segregated choices such as traditional nursing homes) long-term care options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elder Rights Background Documents|url=http://www.globalaging.org/elderrights/us/index.htm|website=Global Action on Aging|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frantiček Klossner''' (born February 28, 1960) is a Swiss artist based in Bern, known for creating video art, installations, performance, drawings and visual poetry. 

== Biography ==
Frantiček Klossner trained as an artist at the [[F+F School for Art and Media Design Zurich]] (1985–1989), among whose teachers were the artists Hansjörg Mattmüller, Hermann Bohmert, Norbert Klassen, Vollrad Kutscher, [[Valie Export]], [[Peter Weibel]], and the philosopher Gerhard J. Lischka, and among whose guest lecturers were [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Paul Virilio]], and [[Vilém Flusser]]. On graduating, he won a City of Bern art scholarship, thanks to which he was able to move into a studio in the East Village in New York City and there focus on video art, performance, and installations. He won a scholarship to the Swiss Institute in Rome in 1995 and after two years at that institution decided to settle in Rome, where he remained active as an artist until 2000. On returning to Switzerland, he headed the exhibition project Identité mobile at the Murten arteplage of the Swiss National Exhibition, Expo.02.

Zopf, Jr. (eds.), Pergamon Press: London, UK, pp. 255–278.&lt;/ref&gt; It says that biological systems minimise a free energy functional of their internal states, which entail beliefs about hidden states in their environment. The implicit minimisation of [[variational free energy]] is formally related to [[variational Bayesian methods]] and was originally introduced by [[Karl Friston]] as an explanation for embodied perception in [[neuroscience]],&lt;ref&gt;Friston, K., Kilner, J., &amp; Harrison, L. (2006). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/A%20free%20energy%20principle%20for%20the%20brain.pdf A free energy principle for the brain]. J Physiol Paris. , 100 (1–3), 70–87.&lt;/ref&gt; where it is also known as '''active inference'''.

== Background ==

The notion that [[self-organisation|self-organising]] biological systems – like a cell or brain – can be understood as minimising variational free energy is based upon [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]]’s observations on [[unconscious inference]]&lt;ref name="Helmholtz"&gt;Helmholtz, H. (1866/1962). Concerning the perceptions in general. In Treatise on physiological optics (J. Southall, Trans., 3rd ed., Vol. III). New York: Dover.&lt;/ref&gt;  and subsequent treatments in psychology &lt;ref&gt;Gregory, R. L. (1980). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2395424 Perceptions as hypotheses]. Phil Trans R Soc Lond B. , 290, 181–197.&lt;/ref&gt; and machine learning.&lt;ref name="Dayan"&gt;Dayan, P., Hinton, G. E., &amp; Neal, R. (1995). [http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~dayan/papers/hm95.pdf The Helmholtz machine]. Neural Computation , 7, 889–904.&lt;/ref&gt; Variational free energy is a function of some outcomes and a probability density over their (hidden) causes. This [[Calculus of variations|variational]] density is defined in relation to a probabilistic model that generates outcomes from causes. In this setting, free energy provides an (upper bound) approximation to [[Marginal likelihood|Bayesian model evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;Beal, M. J. (2003). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/papers/beal03.pdf Variational Algorithms for Approximate Bayesian Inference]. PhD. Thesis, University College London.&lt;/ref&gt; Its minimisation can therefore be used to explain Bayesian inference and learning. When a system actively samples outcomes to minimise free energy, it implicitly performs active inference and maximises the evidence for its (generative) model.

However, free energy is also an upper bound on the [[self-information]] (or surprise) of outcomes, where the long-term average of [[Self-information|surprise]] is entropy. This means that if a system acts to minimise free energy, it will implicitly place an upper bound on the entropy of the outcomes – or sensory states – it samples.&lt;ref name="Friston"&gt;Friston, K. (2012). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/A%20Free%20Energy%20Principle%20for%20Biological%20Systems.pdf A Free Energy Principle for Biological Systems]. Entropy , 14, 2100–2121.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to other theories ===

Active inference is closely related to the [[Good Regulator|good regulator theorem]] &lt;ref&gt;Conant, R. C., &amp; Ashby, R. W. (1970). Every Good Regulator of a system must be a model of that system. Int. J. Systems Sci. , 1 (2), 89–97.&lt;/ref&gt; and related accounts of [[self-organisation]],&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, S. (1993). The Origins of Order: Self-Organization and Selection in Evolution. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolis, G., &amp; Prigogine, I. (1977). Self-organization in non-equilibrium systems. New York: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[self-assembly]], [[pattern formation]], [[autopoiesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Maturana, H. R., &amp; Varela, F. (1980). [http://topologicalmedialab.net/xinwei/classes/readings/Maturana/autopoesis_and_cognition.pdf Autopoiesis: the organization of the living]. In V. F. Maturana HR (Ed.), Autopoiesis and Cognition. Dordrecht, Netherlands: Reidel.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[practopoiesis]]&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2015). Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. Journal of theoretical biology, 373, 40-61.
&lt;/ref&gt;. It addresses the themes considered in [[cybernetics]], [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetics]] &lt;ref&gt;Haken, H. (1983). Synergetics: An introduction. Non-equilibrium phase transition and self-organisation in physics, chemistry and biology (3rd ed.). Berlin: Springer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[embodied cognition]]. Because free energy can be expressed as the expected energy (of outcomes) under the variational density minus its entropy, it is also related to the [[maximum entropy principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Jaynes, E. T. (1957). [http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/theory.1.pdf Information Theory and Statistical Mechanics]. Physical Review Series II , 106 (4), 620–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, because the time average of energy is action, the principle of minimum variational free energy is a [[principle of least action]].

== Definition ==

[[Image:MarokovBlanketFreeEnergyFigure.jpg|500px|right|These schematics illustrate the partition of states into internal and hidden or external states that are separated by a Markov blanket – comprising sensory and active states. The lower panel shows this partition as it would be applied to action and perception in the brain; where active and internal states minimise a free energy functional of sensory states. The ensuing self-organisation of internal states then correspond perception, while action couples brain states back to external states. The upper panel shows exactly the same dependencies but rearranged so that the internal states are associated with the intracellular states of a cell, while the sensory states become the surface states of the cell membrane overlying active states (e.g., the actin filaments of the cytoskeleton).]]

'''Definition''' (continuous formulation): Active inference rests on the tuple &lt;math&gt;(\Omega,\Psi,S,A,R,q,p)&lt;/math&gt;,
* ''A sample space'' &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; – from which random fluctuations &lt;math&gt;\omega \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt; are drawn
* ''Hidden or external states'' &lt;math&gt;\Psi:\Psi\times A \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; – that cause sensory states and depend on action
* ''Sensory states'' &lt;math&gt;S:\Psi \times A \times \Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; – a probabilistic mapping from action and hidden states 
* ''Action'' &lt;math&gt;A:S\times R \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; – that depends on sensory and internal states 
* ''Internal states'' &lt;math&gt;R:R\times S \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; – that cause action and depend on sensory states
* ''Generative density'' &lt;math&gt;p(s, \psi | m)&lt;/math&gt; – over sensory and hidden states under a generative model  &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;
* ''Variational density'' &lt;math&gt;q(\psi | \mu)&lt;/math&gt;  – over hidden states &lt;math&gt;\psi \in \Psi&lt;/math&gt; that is parameterised by internal states &lt;math&gt;\mu \in R&lt;/math&gt;

=== Action and perception ===

The objective is to maximise model evidence &lt;math&gt;p(s|m)&lt;/math&gt; or minimise surprise &lt;math&gt;-\log p(s|m)&lt;/math&gt;. This generally involves an intractable marginalisation over hidden states, so surprise is replaced with an upper variational free energy bound.&lt;ref name="Dayan"/&gt; However, this means that internal states must also minimise free energy, because free energy is a function of sensory and internal states:

: &lt;math&gt;  a(t) = \underset{a}{\operatorname{arg\,min}}   \{ F(s(t),\mu(t)) \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mu(t) = \underset{\mu}{\operatorname{arg\,min}} \{ F(s(t),\mu)) \}  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\underset{\mathrm{free-energy}} {\underbrace{F(s,\mu)}} = \underset{\mathrm{energy}} {\underbrace{ E_q[-\log p(s,\psi \mid m)]}} - \underset{\mathrm{entropy}} {\underbrace{ H[q(\psi | \mu)]}}
= \underset{\mathrm{surprise}} {\underbrace{ -\log p(s | m)}} + \underset{\mathrm{divergence}} {\underbrace{ D_{\mathrm{KL}}[q(\psi | \mu) \| p(\psi \mid s,m)]}} 
  \geq \underset{\mathrm{surprise}} {\underbrace{ -\log p(s | m)}} &lt;/math&gt;

This induces a dual minimisation with respect to action and internal states that correspond to action and perception respectively.

== Free energy minimisation ==

=== Free energy minimisation and self-organisation ===

Free energy minimisation has been proposed as a hallmark of self-organising systems, when cast as [[random dynamical system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Crauel, H., &amp; Flandoli, F. (1994). Attractors for random dynamical systems. Probab Theory Relat Fields , 100, 365–393.&lt;/ref&gt; This formulation rests on a [[Markov blanket]] (comprising action and sensory states) that separates internal and external states. If internal states and action minimise free energy, then they place an upper bound on the entropy of sensory states

&lt;math&gt;  \lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T} \underset{\mathrm{free-action}} {\underbrace{\int_0^T F(s(t),\mu (t))dt}}  \ge
\lim_{T\to\infty} \frac{1}{T} \int_0^T \underset{\mathrm{surprise}}{\underbrace{-\log p(s(t)|m)}} dt = H[p(s|m)] &lt;/math&gt;

This is because – under [[Ergodic theory|ergodic]] assumptions – the long-term average of surprise is entropy. This bound resists a natural tendency to disorder – of the sort associated with the [[second law of thermodynamics]] and the [[fluctuation theorem]].

=== Free energy minimisation and Bayesian inference ===

All Bayesian inference can be cast in terms of free energy minimisation; e.g.,.&lt;ref&gt;Roweis, S., &amp; [[Zoubin Ghahramani|Ghahramani, Z.]] (1999). [http://authors.library.caltech.edu/13697/1/ROWnc99.pdf A unifying review of linear Gaussian models]. Neural Computat. , 11 (2), 305–45. {{doi|10.1162/089976699300016674}}&lt;/ref&gt; When free energy is minimised with respect to internal states, the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] between the variational and posterior density over hidden states is minimised. This corresponds to approximate [[Bayesian inference]] – when the form of the variational density is fixed – and exact [[Bayesian inference]] otherwise. Free energy minimisation therefore provides a generic description of Bayesian inference and filtering (e.g., [[Kalman filter]]ing). It is also used in Bayesian [[model selection]], where free energy can be usefully decomposed into complexity and accuracy:

: &lt;math&gt; \underset{\mathrm{free-energy}} {\underbrace{ F(s,\mu)}} = \underset{\mathrm{complexity}} {\underbrace{ D_\mathrm{KL}[q(\psi|\mu)\| p(\psi|m)]}} - \underset{\mathrm{accuracy}} {\underbrace{E_q[\log p(s|\psi,m)]}}&lt;/math&gt;
 
Models with minimum free energy provide an accurate explanation of data, under complexity costs (c.f., [[Occam's razor]] and more formal treatments of computational costs &lt;ref&gt;Ortega, P. A., &amp; Braun, D. A. (2012). [http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/469/2153/20120683 Thermodynamics as a theory of decision-making with information processing costs].  Proceedings of the Royal Society A, vol. 469, no. 2153 (20120683) .&lt;/ref&gt;). Here, complexity is the divergence between the variational density and prior beliefs about hidden states (i.e., the effective degrees of freedom used to explain the data).

=== Free energy minimisation and thermodynamics ===

Variational free energy is an information theoretic functional and is distinct from thermodynamic (Helmholtz) [[Helmholtz free energy|free energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans, D. J. (2003). [http://rscweb.anu.edu.au/~evans/papers/NEFET.pdf A non-equilibrium free energy theorem for deterministic systems]. Molecular Physics , 101, 15551–4.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the complexity term of variational free energy shares the same fixed point as Helmholtz free energy (under the assumption the system is thermodynamically closed but not isolated). This is because if sensory perturbations are suspended (for a suitably long period of time), complexity is minimised (because accuracy can be neglected). At this point, the system is at equilibrium and internal states minimise Helmholtz free energy, by the [[principle of minimum energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Jarzynski, C. (1997). [https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/9610209.pdf Nonequilibrium equality for free energy differences]. Phys. Rev. Lett., 78, 2690.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Free energy minimisation and information theory ===

Free energy minimisation is equivalent to maximising the [[mutual information]] between sensory states and internal states that parameterise the variational density (for a fixed entropy variational density).&lt;ref name="Friston" /&gt; This relates free energy minimization to the principle of minimum redundancy &lt;ref&gt;Barlow, H. (1961). [http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/horacebarlow/21.pdf Possible principles underlying the transformations of sensory messages]. In W. Rosenblith (Ed.), Sensory Communication (pp. 217-34). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and related treatments using information theory to describe optimal behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Linsker, R. (1990). [http://psych.stanford.edu/~jlm/pdfs/LinskerAnnRev90.pdf Perceptual neural organization: some approaches based on network models and information theory]. Annu Rev Neurosci. , 13, 257–81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bialek, W., Nemenman, I., &amp; Tishby, N. (2001). [http://www.princeton.edu/~wbialek/our_papers/bnt_01a.pdf Predictability, complexity, and learning]. Neural Computat., 13 (11), 2409–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Free energy minimisation in neuroscience ==

Free energy minimisation provides a useful way to formulate normative (Bayes optimal) models of neuronal inference and learning under uncertainty &lt;ref&gt;Friston, K. (2010). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/The%20free-energy%20principle%20A%20unified%20brain%20theory.pdf The free-energy principle: a unified brain theory?] Nat Rev Neurosci. , 11 (2), 127–38.&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore subscribes to the [[Bayesian brain]] hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Knill, D. C., &amp; Pouget, A. (2004). [http://mrl.isr.uc.pt/pub/bscw.cgi/d27540/ReviewKnillPouget2.pdf The Bayesian brain: the role of uncertainty in neural coding and computation]. Trends Neurosci. , 27 (12), 712–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The neuronal processes described by free energy minimisation depend on the nature of hidden states: &lt;math&gt; \Psi = X \times \Theta \times \Pi &lt;/math&gt; that can comprise time dependent variables, time invariant parameters and the precision (inverse variance or temperature) of random fluctuations. Minimising variables, parameters and precision corresponds to inference, learning and the encoding of uncertainty, respectively:

=== Perceptual inference and categorisation ===

Free energy minimisation formalises the notion of [[unconscious inference]] in perception &lt;ref name="Helmholtz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dayan" /&gt; and provides a normative (Bayesian) theory of neuronal processing. The associated process theory of neuronal dynamics is based on minimising free energy through gradient descent. This corresponds to [[Generalized filtering|generalised Bayesian filtering]] (where ~ denotes a variable in generalised coordinates of motion and  &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is a derivative matrix operator):&lt;ref&gt;Friston, K., Stephan, K., Li, B., &amp; Daunizeau, J. (2010). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Generalised%20Filtering.pdf Generalised Filtering]. Mathematical Problems in Engineering , vol., 2010, 621670&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\tilde{\mu}} = D \tilde{\mu} - \partial_{\tilde{\mu}} F(s,\tilde{\mu})&lt;/math&gt;

Usually, the generative models that define free energy are non-linear and hierarchical (like cortical hierarchies in the brain). Special cases of generalised filtering include [[Kalman filter]]ing, which is formally equivalent to [[predictive coding]] &lt;ref&gt;Rao, R. P., &amp; Ballard, D. H. (1999). Predictive coding in the visual cortex: a functional interpretation of some extra-classical receptive-field effects. Nat Neurosci. , 2 (1), 79–87.&lt;/ref&gt; – a popular metaphor for message passing in the brain. Under hierarchical models, predictive coding involves the recurrent exchange of ascending (bottom-up) prediction errors and descending (top-down) predictions &lt;ref name="Mumford"&gt;Mumford, D. (1992). [http://cs.brown.edu/people/tld/projects/cortex/course/suggested_reading_list/supplements/documents/MumfordBC-92.pdf On the computational architecture of the neocortex]. II. Biol. Cybern. , 66, 241–51.&lt;/ref&gt; that is consistent with the anatomy and physiology of sensory &lt;ref&gt;Bastos, A. M., Usrey, W. M., Adams, R. A., Mangun, G. R., Fries, P., &amp; Friston, K. J. (2012). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Canonical%20Microcircuits%20for%20Predictive%20Coding.pdf Canonical microcircuits for predictive coding]. Neuron , 76 (4), 695–711.&lt;/ref&gt; and motor systems.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, R. A., Shipp, S., &amp; Friston, K. J. (2013). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Predictions%20not%20commands%20-%20active%20inference%20in%20the%20motor%20system.pdf Predictions not commands: active inference in the motor system]. Brain Struct Funct. , 218 (3), 611–43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Perceptual learning and memory ===

In predictive coding, optimising model parameters through a gradient ascent on the time integral of free energy (free action) reduces to associative or [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian plasticity]] and is associated with [[synaptic plasticity]] in the brain.

=== Perceptual precision, attention and salience ===

Optimising the precision parameters corresponds to optimising the gain of prediction errors (c.f., Kalman gain). In neuronally plausible implementations of predictive coding,&lt;ref name="Mumford" /&gt; this corresponds to optimising the excitability superficial pyramidal cells and has been interpreted in terms of attentional gain.&lt;ref name="Feldman"&gt;Feldman, H., &amp; Friston, K. J. (2010). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Attention%20uncertainty%20and%20free-energy.pdf Attention, uncertainty, and free-energy]. Frontiers in Human Neuroscience , 4, 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Active inference ==

When gradient descent is applied to action &lt;math&gt; \dot{a} = -\partial_aF(s,\tilde{\mu}) &lt;/math&gt;, motor control can be understood in terms of classical reflex arcs that are engaged by descending (corticospinal) predictions. This provides a formalism that generalizes the equilibrium point solution – to the [[degrees of freedom problem]] &lt;ref&gt;Feldman, A. G., &amp; Levin, M. F. (1995). [http://e.guigon.free.fr/rsc/article/FeldmanLevin95.pdf The origin and use of positional frames of reference in motor control]. Behav Brain Sci. , 18, 723–806.&lt;/ref&gt; – to movement trajectories.

=== Active inference and optimal control ===

Active inference is related to [[optimal control]] by replacing value or cost-to-go functions with prior beliefs about state transitions or flow.&lt;ref&gt;Friston, K., (2011). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/What%20Is%20Optimal%20about%20Motor%20Control.pdf What is optimal about motor control?]. Neuron, 72(3), 488–98.&lt;/ref&gt; This exploits the close connection between Bayesian filtering and the solution to the [[Bellman equation]]. However, active inference starts with (priors over) flow &lt;math&gt; f = \Gamma \cdot \nabla V + \nabla \times W &lt;/math&gt; that are specified with scalar &lt;math&gt; V(x) &lt;/math&gt;  and vector &lt;math&gt; W(x) &lt;/math&gt; value functions of state space (c.f., the [[Helmholtz decomposition]]).  Here, &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt; is the amplitude of random fluctuations and cost is &lt;math&gt; c(x) = f \cdot \nabla V + \nabla \cdot \Gamma \cdot V&lt;/math&gt;.  The priors over flow &lt;math&gt; p(\tilde{x}|m) &lt;/math&gt; induce a prior over states &lt;math&gt; p(x|m) = \exp (V(x)) &lt;/math&gt; that is the solution to the appropriate forward [[Kolmogorov equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Friston, K., &amp; Ao, P. (2012). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Free%20Energy%20Value%20and%20Attractors.pdf Free-energy, value and attractors]. Computational and mathematical methods in medicine, 2012, 937860.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, optimal control optimises the flow, given a cost function, under the assumption that &lt;math&gt; W = 0 &lt;/math&gt; (i.e., the flow is curl free or has detailed balance). Usually, this entails solving backward [[Kolmogorov equations]].&lt;ref&gt;Kappen, H., (2005). [https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0505066v4.pdf Path integrals and symmetry breaking for optimal control theory]. Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 11, p. P11011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Active inference and optimal decision (game) theory ===

[[Optimal decision]] problems (usually formulated as [[partially observable Markov decision process]]es) are treated within active inference by absorbing [[Utility| utility functions]] into prior beliefs. In this setting, states that have a high utility (low cost) are states an agent expects to occupy. By equipping the generative model with hidden states that model control, policies (control sequences) that minimise variational free energy lead to high utility states.&lt;ref&gt;Friston, K., Samothrakis, S. &amp; Montague, R., (2012). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Active%20inference%20and%20agency%20optimal%20control%20without%20cost%20functions.pdf Active inference and agency: optimal control without cost functions]. Biol. Cybernetics, 106(8–9), 523–41.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Neurobiologically, neuromodulators like [[dopamine]] are considered to report the precision of prediction errors by modulating the gain of principal cells encoding prediction error.&lt;ref name="Friston_a"&gt;Friston, K. J. Shiner T, FitzGerald T, Galea JM, Adams R, Brown H, Dolan RJ, Moran R, Stephan KE, Bestmann S. (2012). [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~karl/Dopamine%20Affordance%20and%20Active%20Inference.pdf Dopamine, affordance and active inference]. PLoS Comput. Biol., 8(1), p. e1002327.&lt;/ref&gt; This is closely related to – but formally distinct from – the role of dopamine in reporting prediction errors ''per se'' &lt;ref&gt;Fiorillo, C. D., Tobler, P. N. &amp; Schultz, W., (2003). [http://e.guigon.free.fr/rsc/article/FiorilloEtAl03.pdf Discrete coding of reward probability and uncertainty by dopamine neurons].

=== Active inference and cognitive neuroscience ===

Active inference has been used to address a range of issues in [[cognitive neuroscience]], brain function and neuropsychiatry, including: action observation,&lt;ref&gt;Friston, K., Mattout, J. &amp; Kilner, J., (2011).

'''Hazchem''' (hazardous chemicals)({{IPAc-en|'|h|æ|z|k|ɛ|m}})&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|Hazchem}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a warning plate system used in [[Australia]], [[Malaysia]], [[New Zealand]], [[India]] and the [[United Kingdom]] for vehicles transporting [[dangerous goods|hazardous substances]], and on storage facilities. The top-left section of the plate gives the Emergency Action Code (EAC) telling the [[fire brigade]] what actions to take if there's an accident or fire. The middle-left section containing a 4 digit number gives the [[UN number|UN Substance Identification Number]] describing the material. The lower-left section gives the telephone number that should be called if special advice is needed. The warning symbol in the top right indicates the general hazard class of the material. The bottom-right of the plate carries a company [[logo]] or name.

There is also a standard null Hazchem plate to indicate the transport of non-hazardous substances. The null plate does not include an EAC or substance identification.

The [[National Chemical Emergency Centre]] (NCEC) in the United Kingdom provides a Free Online Hazchem Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.the-ncec.com/free-online-hazmat-hazchem-guide |title=Free Online Hazchem Guide |access-date=2013-08-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512065348/http://the-ncec.com/free-online-hazmat-hazchem-guide |archive-date=2014-05-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergency Action Code ==
The Emergency Action Code (EAC) is a three character code displayed on all dangerous goods classed carriers, and provides a quick assessment to first responders and emergency responders (i.e. [[fire fighter]]s and [[police]]) of what actions to take should the carrier carrying such goods become involved in an incident (traffic collision, for example). EAC's are characterised by a single number (1 to 4) and either one or two letters (depending on the hazard).

NCEC was commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (CLG) to edit the EAC List 2013 publication, outlining the application of Hazchem Emergency Actions Codes (EACs) in Britain for 2013.  The Dangerous Goods Emergency Action Code (EAC) List is reviewed every two years and is an essential compliance document for all emergency services, local government and for those who may control the planning for, and prevention of, emergencies involving dangerous goods. The current EAC List is 20013. NCEC has been at the heart of the UK EAC system since its inception in the early 1970s, publishing the list on behalf of the UK Government until 1996 and resuming its management in 2008.

The printed version of the book can be purchased from TSO directly ({{ISBN|9780117541184}}) or downloaded as a [https://d18hkfaesybon0.cloudfront.net/ncec/media/assets/downloads/ncec-emergency-action-code-list-2017.pdf PDF file] from NCEC’s website.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;Water must not be allowed to come into contact with the substance at risk.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="nswrfsfpr"/&gt;

This number is indicative of what type of [[fire suppressant]] should be used to suppress a fire from igniting or extinguish a fire caused by the chemical. The system is designed to rank fire suppression methods in order of usability.&lt;ref name="suppressionrank" /&gt; For example, a chemical marked with the number '''2''' or '''Fog''' can be attacked with methods '''3''' (Foam) or '''4''' (Dry Agent) but not with '''1''' (Jets).&lt;ref name="suppressionrank"&gt;SafeWork SA (2000) ''Safeguards''. Retrieved 2010-10-03 from http://www.safework.sa.gov.au/uploaded_files/ds9i.pdf. (page 1: ''The system permits a medium of a higher numeric classification to be used than that indicated, however, a medium with a lower numeric classification than that indicated should not be used.'')&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dry Agent" method must be used for chemicals that have an undesirable reaction with water and must not be allowed to come in contact with water, therefore '''4''' is the highest ranking suppression method as all of the other methods use water.

=== HazChem safety parameters ===
Each EAC contains at least one letter, which determines which category the chemical falls under, and which also highlights the violence of the chemical (i.e. likelihood to spontaneously combust, explode etc.), what [[personal protective equipment]] to use while working around the chemical and what action to take when disposing of the chemical.

[[File:Hazchem3yediff.jpg|thumb|right|Comparison denoting the difference between [[Personal Protective Equipment|PPE]] deployment with 3YE chemicals]]
Each category is assigned a letter to determine what actions are required when handling, containing and disposing of the chemical in question. Eight 'major categories' exist which are commonly denoted by a black letter on a white background. Four subcategories exist which specifically deal with what type of personal protective equipment responders must wear when handling the emergency, denoted by a white letter on a black background. In Australia with the update of the [[Australian Dangerous Goods Code]] volume 7 as of 2010, the white letter on a black background has been removed, making BA a requirement at all large incidents regardless of whether the substance is involved in a fire.

If a category is classed as violent, this means that the chemical can be violently or explosively reactive,&lt;ref name="nswrfsfpr"/&gt; either with the atmosphere or water, or both (which could be marked by the [[HAZMAT Class 4 Flammable Solids|Dangerous when Wet]] symbol).

Protection is divided up into three categories of personal protective equipment, ''Full'', ''BA'' and ''BA for fire only''. Full denotes that full personal protective equipment provisions must be used around and in contact with the chemical, which will usually include a portable [[Self-contained breathing apparatus|breathing apparatus]] and water tight and chemical proof suit. ''BA'' (acronym for breathing apparatus) specifies that a portable breathing apparatus must be used at all times in and around the chemical, and ''BA for fire only'' specifies that a breathing apparatus is not necessary for short exposure periods to the chemical but is required if the chemical is on alight. ''BA for fire only'' is denoted within the emergency action code as a white letter on a black background, while a black letter on a white background denotes breathing apparatus at all times. &lt;ins&gt;When changing the background colour is not possible (such as with handwriting), the use of brackets means the same as a black background. "3[Y]E" means the same as a white letter on a black background.&lt;/ins&gt;

Substance control specifies what to do with the chemical in the event of a spill, either ''dilute'' or ''contain''. Dilute means that the chemical may be washed down the drain with large quantities of water. ''Contain'' requires that the spillage must not come in contact with drains or water courses.

In the event of a chemical incident, the EAC may specify that an evacuation may be necessary as the chemical poses a public hazard which may extend beyond the immediate vicinity. If evacuation is not possible, advice to stay in doors and secure all points of ventilation may be necessary. This condition is denoted by an '''E''' at the end of any emergency action code. It is an optional letter, depending on the nature of the chemical.

=== Examples ===
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|'''3'''||align="center"|'''Y'''||'''E'''||Use foam or dry agent, substance reacts violently/is explosive, BA use is essential, evacuate vicinity, contain spill.
|-
|'''3''' ||align="center" style="background: #000000; color: #FFFFFF;"|'''Y'''||'''E'''||Use foam or dry agent, substance reacts violently/is explosive, Use BA if fire present, evacuate vicinity, contain spill.
|-
|'''2'''||colspan="2"|'''R'''||Use fog, foam or dry agent, substance is not violent, use full [[Personal Protective Equipment|PPE]], dilute spill.

|-
|'''1'''||align="center" style="background: #000000; color: #FFFFFF;"|'''S'''||'''E'''||Use jets, fog, foam or dry agent; BA for fire only; evacuate vicinity; dilute spill.
|}

A very commonly displayed example is '''3YE''' on [[petrol]] [[tank truck|tankers]]. This means that a fire must be fought using foam or dry agent (if a small fire), that it can react violently and is explosive, that fire fighters must wear a portable breathing apparatus at all times, or if a white on black Y, only if there is a fire, and that the run-off needs to be contained. It also indicates to the [[Incident Command System|incident controller]] that evacuation of the surrounding area may be necessary.

=== Calculation of Hazchem action code for multi-loads or sites with multiple Hazchem codes ===

Example:&lt;ref&gt;Australian Dangerous Goods Code, 7th Edition, Section C2.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jr.chemwatch.net/help/goldffx/Repository/GoldFFX%20Help.html?HazchemCodeCalculationforMoreSub.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-20 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150120091347/http://jr.chemwatch.net/help/goldffx/Repository/GoldFFX%20Help.html?HazchemCodeCalculationforMoreSub.html |archive-date=2015-01-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three substances to be carried as a multi-load, having emergency action codes of 3Y, •2S and 4WE.

'''1st Character (Number):'''
The first character of the EAC for each of the three substances is 3, 2 and 4. The highest number must be taken as the first character of the code for the multi-load and therefore the first character will be 4. The bullet in •2S is not assigned to the mixed load because other EACs do not include a bullet.

'''2nd Character (Letter):'''
The second character for the EAC for each of the three substances is Y, S and W. Taking the Y along the top row of the chart and the S along the left hand column, the intersection is at Y and therefore the character for the first two substances would be Y. This resultant character (Y) is then taken along the top row and the character for the third substance (W) is taken along the left hand column. The intersection point is now W. The second character of the code for the three substances is therefore W.

'''Letter ‘E’:'''
The third substance has an ‘E’ as a third character and therefore the multi-load must also have an ‘E’.

The resultant Hazchem Code for the three substances carried as a multi-load will therefore be 4WE.

[[Image:HubbleTuningFork.jpg|thumb|350px|Tuning-fork style diagram of the Hubble sequence]]

Hubble’s scheme divides regular galaxies into three broad classes – [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]], [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] and [[spiral galaxy|spirals]] – based on their visual appearance (originally on [[photographic plate]]s). A fourth class contains galaxies with an [[irregular galaxy|irregular]] appearance. To this day, the Hubble sequence is the most commonly used system for classifying galaxies, both in professional astronomical research and in [[amateur astronomy]].

==Classes of galaxies==

===Ellipticals===

[[Image:Abell S740, cropped to ESO 325-G004.jpg|thumb|The giant elliptical galaxy ESO 325-G004.]]
On the left (in the sense that the sequence is usually drawn) lie the [[elliptical galaxy|ellipticals]]. Elliptical galaxies have relatively smooth, featureless light distributions and appear as ellipses in photographic images. They are denoted by the letter E, followed by an integer ''n'' representing their degree of [[Flattening|ellipticity]] in the sky. By convention, ''n'' is ten times the ellipticity of the galaxy, rounded to the nearest integer, where the ellipticity is defined as {{nowrap|''e'' {{=}} 1 − {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}} for an ellipse with semi-major and semi-minor axes of lengths ''a'' and ''b'' respectively.&lt;ref name="binney_merrifield"&gt;{{cite book |last=Binney |first=J. |authorlink=James Binney |author2=Merrifield, M. |title=Galactic Astronomy |date=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |isbn=978-0-691-02565-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ellipticity increases from left to right on the Hubble diagram, with near-circular (E0) galaxies situated on the very left of the diagram. It is important to note that the ellipticity of a galaxy on the sky is only indirectly related to the true 3-dimensional shape (for example, a flattened, discus-shaped galaxy can appear almost round if viewed face-on or highly elliptical if viewed edge-on). Observationally, the most flattened "elliptical" galaxies have ellipticities ''e'' = 0.7 (denoted E7).  However, from studying the light profiles and the ellipticity profiles, rather than just looking at the images, it was realised in the 1960s that the E5–E7 galaxies are probably misclassified lenticular galaxies with large-scale disks seen at various inclinations to our line-of-sight.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Liller (1966), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1966ApJ...146...28L The Distribution of Intensity in Elliptical Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster.

===Lenticulars===
[[Image:Ngc5866 hst big rotated.jpg|thumb|The [[NGC 5866|Spindle Galaxy]] (NGC 5866), a lenticular galaxy with a prominent [[dust lane]] in the [[Draco (constellation)|constellation of Draco]].]]
At the centre of the Hubble tuning fork, where the two spiral-galaxy branches and the elliptical branch join, lies an intermediate class of galaxies known as [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] and given the symbol S0. These galaxies consist of a bright central [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]], similar in appearance to an [[elliptical galaxy]], surrounded by an extended, [[galaxy disk|disk]]-like structure. Unlike [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]], the disks of lenticular galaxies have no visible spiral structure and are not actively forming stars in any significant quantity. 

When simply looking at a galaxy's image, lenticular galaxies with relatively face-on disks are difficult to distinguish from ellipticals of type E0–E3, making the classification of many such galaxies uncertain. When viewed edge-on, the disk becomes more apparent and prominent dust-lanes are sometimes visible in [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] at optical wavelengths.

At the time of the initial publication of Hubble's galaxy classification scheme, the existence of lenticular galaxies was purely hypothetical. Hubble believed that they were necessary as an intermediate stage between the highly flattened "ellipticals" and spirals. Later [[observational astronomy|observations]] (by Hubble himself, among others) showed Hubble's belief to be correct and the S0 class was included in the definitive exposition of the Hubble sequence by [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref name="sandage"&gt;{{cite conference |first = A. |last = Sandage |authorlink = Allan Sandage |date = 1975 |title = Classification and Stellar Content of Galaxies Obtained from Direct Photography |booktitle = Galaxies and the Universe |editor = A. Sandage |others = M. Sandage and J. Kristian |url = http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sandage/frames.html |accessdate = 2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Missing from the Hubble sequence are the early-type galaxies with intermediate-scale disks, in between the E and S0 type, Martha Liller denoted them '''ES''' galaxies in 1966.

Lenticular and spiral galaxies, taken together, are often referred to as [[disk galaxy|disk galaxies]].  The bulge-to-disk flux ratio in lenticular galaxies can take on a range of values, just as it does for each of the spiral galaxy morphological types (Sa, Sb, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graham |first=A. |author2=Worley, C. |date=August 2008 |title=Inclination- and dust-corrected galaxy parameters: bulge-to-disc ratios and size-luminosity relations |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=388 |issue=4 |pages=1708–1728 |bibcode=2008MNRAS.388.1708G |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13506.x|arxiv = 0805.3565 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spirals===
[[Image:M101 hires STScI-PRC2006-10a.jpg|thumb|The [[Pinwheel Galaxy]] (Messier 101/NGC 5457): a spiral galaxy classified as type Scd on the Hubble sequence]]
[[Image:Hubble2005-01-barred-spiral-galaxy-NGC1300.jpg|thumb|right|The barred spiral galaxy [[NGC 1300]]: a type SBbc]]
On the right of the Hubble sequence diagram are two parallel branches encompassing the [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]]. A spiral galaxy consists of a flattened [[galaxy disk|disk]], with [[star]]s forming a (usually two-armed) [[spiral]] structure, and a central concentration of stars known as the [[bulge (astronomy)|bulge]]. Roughly half of all spirals are also observed to have a bar-like structure, extending from the central bulge, at the ends of which the spiral arms begin. In the tuning-fork diagram, the regular spirals occupy the upper branch and are denoted by the letter S, while the lower branch contains the barred spirals, given the symbol SB. Both type of spirals are further subdivided according to the detailed appearance of their spiral structures. Membership of one of these subdivisions is indicated by adding a lower-case letter to the morphological type, as follows:
* Sa (SBa) – tightly wound, smooth arms; large, bright central bulge
* Sb (SBb) – less tightly wound spiral arms than Sa (SBa); somewhat fainter bulge
* Sc (SBc) – loosely wound spiral arms, clearly resolved into individual stellar clusters and nebulae; smaller, fainter bulge

Hubble originally described three classes of spiral galaxy. This was extended by [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]]&lt;ref name="devaucouleurs"&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs |date=1959 |title=Classification and Morphology of External Galaxies |journal=Handbuch der Physik |volume=53 |pages=275 |bibcode=1959HDP....53..275D |last2=Oemler |first2=Augustus, Jr. |last3=Butcher |first3=Harvey R. |last4=Gunn |first4=James E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include a fourth class:
* Sd (SBd) – very loosely wound, fragmentary arms; most of the luminosity is in the arms and not the bulge

Although strictly part of the [[Galaxy morphological classification#De Vaucouleurs system|de Vaucouleurs system]] of classification, the Sd class is often included in the Hubble sequence. The basic spiral types can be extended to enable finer distinctions of appearance. For example, spiral galaxies whose appearance is intermediate between two of the above classes are often identified by appending two lower-case letters to the main galaxy type (for example, Sbc for a galaxy that is intermediate between an Sb and an Sc).

Our own [[Milky Way]] is generally classed as SBb or SBc&lt;ref&gt;Paul Hodge (1983), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983PASP...95..721H The Hubble type of the Milky Way Galaxy]&lt;/ref&gt;, making it a barred spiral with well-defined arms. 

Examples of regular spiral galaxies: [[Andromeda Galaxy|M31]] (Andromeda Galaxy), [[Messier 74|M74]], [[Messier 81|M81]], [[Sombrero Galaxy|M104]] (Sombrero Galaxy), [[Whirlpool Galaxy|M51a]] (Whirlpool Galaxy), [[NGC 300]], [[NGC 772]].

Examples of barred spiral galaxies: [[Messier 91|M91]], [[Messier 95|M95]], [[NGC 1097]], [[NGC 1300]], [[NGC1672]], [[NGC 2536]], [[NGC 2903]].

[[Image:large.mc.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|The [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] (LMC) - a dwarf [[irregular galaxy]]]]
Galaxies that do not fit into the Hubble sequence, because they have no regular structure (either disk-like or ellipsoidal), are termed [[irregular galaxy|irregular galaxies]]. Hubble defined two classes of irregular galaxy:&lt;ref name="longair"&gt;{{cite book |last=Longair |first=M. S. |authorlink=Malcolm Longair |title=Galaxy Formation |date=1998 |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=3-540-63785-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Irr I galaxies have asymmetric profiles and lack a central bulge or obvious spiral structure; instead they contain many individual clusters of young stars
* Irr II galaxies have smoother, asymmetric appearances and are not clearly resolved into individual stars or stellar clusters
In his extension to the Hubble sequence, de Vaucouleurs called the Irr I galaxies 'Magellanic irregulars', after the [[Magellanic Clouds]] – two satellites of the Milky Way which Hubble classified as Irr I. The discovery of a faint spiral structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Vaucouleurs |first=G. |authorlink=Gérard de Vaucouleurs |date=1955 |title=Studies of Magellanic Clouds. I. Dimensions and structure of the Large Cloud |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=160 |pages=126–140 |bibcode=1955AJ.....60..126D |doi=10.1086/107173 |last2=Oemler |first2=Augustus, Jr. |last3=Butcher |first3=Harvey R. |last4=Gunn |first4=James E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]] led de Vaucouleurs to further divide the irregular galaxies into those that, like the LMC, show some evidence for spiral structure (these are given the symbol Sm) and those that have no obvious structure, such as the [[Small Magellanic Cloud]] (denoted Im). In the extended Hubble sequence, the Magellanic irregulars are usually placed at the end of the spiral branch of the Hubble tuning fork.

Examples of irregular galaxies: [[Messier 82|M82]], [[NGC 1427A]], [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], [[Small Magellanic Cloud]].

==Physical significance==

Elliptical and lenticular galaxies are commonly referred to together as “early-type” galaxies, while spirals and irregular galaxies are referred to as “late types”. This nomenclature is the source of the common,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baldry |first=I. K. |date=2008 |title=Hubble's Galaxy Nomenclature |journal=Astronomy &amp; Geophysics |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=5.25 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4004.2008.49525.x |bibcode=2008A&amp;G....49e..25B|arxiv = 0809.0125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but erroneous, belief that the Hubble sequence was intended to reflect a supposed [[evolution (term)|evolutionary]] sequence, from [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] through [[lenticular galaxy|lenticulars]] to either [[barred spiral galaxy|barred]] or [[spiral galaxy|regular spirals]]. In fact, Hubble was clear from the beginning that no such interpretation was implied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The nomenclature, it is emphasized, refers to position in the sequence, and temporal connotations are made at one's peril. The entire classification is purely empirical and without prejudice to theories of evolution...&lt;ref name="hubble27"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hubble |first=E. P. |authorlink=Edwin Hubble |date=1927 |title=The Classification of Spiral Nebulae |journal=The Observatory |volume=50 |pages=276 |bibcode=1927Obs....50..276H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The evolutionary picture appears to be lent weight by the fact that the disks of spiral galaxies are observed to be home to many young [[star]]s and regions of active [[star formation]], while elliptical galaxies are composed of predominantly old stellar populations. In fact, current evidence suggests the opposite: the early Universe appears to be dominated by spiral and irregular galaxies. In the currently favored picture of [[galaxy formation]], present-day ellipticals formed as a result of mergers between these earlier building blocks; while some lenticular galaxies may have formed this way, others may have accreted their disks around pre-existing spheroids.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Alister W.; Dullo, Bililign T.; Savorgnan, Giulia A. D. (2015), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...804...32G Hiding in Plain Sight: An Abundance of Compact Massive Spheroids in the Local Universe]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some lenticular galaxies may also be evolved spiral galaxies, whose gas has been stripped away leaving no fuel for continued star formation&lt;ref name="ChristensenMartin2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lars Lindberg Christensen|author2=Davide de Martin|author3=Raquel Yumi Shida|title=Cosmic Collisions: The Hubble Atlas of Merging Galaxies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QhRAokTI2RYC&amp;pg=PA24|date=7 April 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-93855-4|pages=24–}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the galaxy [[LEDA 2108986]] opens the debate on this.


==Shortcomings==

A common criticism of the Hubble scheme is that the criteria for assigning galaxies to classes are subjective, leading to different observers assigning galaxies to different classes (although experienced observers usually agree to within less than a single Hubble type).&lt;ref name=dressler_et_al&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dressler|first=A. |last2=Oemler, Jr.|first2=A. |last3=Butcher|first3=H. R. |last4=Gunn|first4=J. E. |date=July 1994 |title=The morphology of distant cluster galaxies. 1: HST observations of CL 0939+4713 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=430 |issue=1 |pages=107–120 |bibcode=1994ApJ...430..107D | doi = 10.1086/174386}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lahav, O., et al. (1995), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995Sci...267..859L Galaxies, Human Eyes, and Artificial Neural Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although not really a short-coming, since the 1961 Hubble Atlas of Galaxies, the primary criteria used to assign the morphological type (a, b, c, etc.) has been the nature of the spiral arms, rather than the bulge-to-disk flux ratio, and thus a range of flux ratios exist for each morphological type&lt;ref&gt;Allan Sandage (1961), [The Hubble Atlas of Galaxies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vorontsov-Vel'Yaminov, B. A.; Arkhipova, V. P. (1962), [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1962MCG...C01....0V Morphological catalogue of galaxies. Part 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vorontsov-Vel'Yaminov, B. A.; Noskova, R. I. (1973) [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1973SvA....16..824V Photometric Parameters of Flat Galaxies.]&lt;/ref&gt;, as with the lenticular galaxies.

Another criticism of the Hubble classification scheme is that, being based on the appearance of a galaxy in a two-dimensional image, the classes are only indirectly related to the true physical properties of galaxies. In particular, problems arise because of [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] effects. The same galaxy would look very different, if viewed edge-on, as opposed to a face-on or ‘broadside’ viewpoint.  As such, the early-type sequence is poorly represented: the ES galaxies are missing from the Hubble sequence, and the E5–E7 galaxies are actually S0 galaxies.  Furthermore, the barred ES and barred S0 galaxies are also absent.

Visual classifications are also less reliable for faint or distant galaxies, and the appearance of galaxies can change depending on the [[wavelength]] of light in which they are observed.

Nonetheless, the Hubble sequence is still commonly used in the field of [[extragalactic astronomy]] and Hubble types are known to correlate with many physically relevant properties of galaxies, such as [[Luminosity|luminosities]], colours, masses (of stars and gas) and star formation rates.&lt;ref name=roberts_haynes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=M.

P. |date=1994 |title=Physical Parameters along the Hubble Sequence |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=115–152 |bibcode=1994ARA&amp;A..32..115R |doi=10.1146/annurev.aa.32.090194.000555}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
As early as the 1920s, the concept of using hot water and alkali catalysts to produce oil out of biomass was proposed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Production of Oil from Plant Material|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/99/2573/309|journal = Science|date = 1944-04-21|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 17737216|pages = 309–312|volume = 99|issue = 2573|doi = 10.1126/science.99.2573.309|first = E.|last = Berl|bibcode = 1944Sci....99..309B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the foundation of later HTL technologies that attracted research interest especially during the 1970s oil embargo. It was around that time that a high-pressure (hydrothermal) liquefaction process was developed at the Pittsburgh Energy Research Center (PERC) and later demonstrated (at the 100&amp;nbsp;kg/h scale) at the Albany Biomass Liquefaction Experimental Facility at Albany, Oregon, US.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; In 1982, Shell Oil developed the HTU™ process in the
Netherlands.&lt;ref name="ToorReview" /&gt; Other organizations that have previously demonstrated HTL of biomass include Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften Hamburg, Germany, SCF Technologies in Copenhagen, Denmark, EPA’s Water Engineering Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA, and Changing World Technology Inc.

== Chemical reactions ==
In hydrothermal liquefaction processes, long carbon chain molecules in biomass are thermally cracked and oxygen is removed in the form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (dehydration) and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (decarboxylation). These reactions result in the production of high H/C ratio bio-oil. Simplified descriptions of dehydration and decarboxylation reactions can be found in the literature (e.g. Asghari and Yoshida (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Dehydration of fructose to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in sub-critical water over heterogeneous zirconium phosphate catalysts|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008621506003363|journal = Carbohydrate Research|date = 2006-10-16|pages = 2379–2387|volume = 341|issue = 14|doi = 10.1016/j.carres.2006.06.025|first = Feridoun Salak|last = Asghari|first2 = Hiroyuki|last2 = Yoshida}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Snåre et al.

Yu.|last6 = Murzin}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Process==
Most applications of hydrothermal liquefaction operate at temperatures between 250-550&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and high pressures of 5-25 MPa as well as catalysts for 20–60 minutes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; although higher or lower temperatures can be used to optimize gas or liquid yields, respectively.&lt;ref name="ToorReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Toor|first1=Saqib Sohail|last2=Rosendahl|first2=Lasse|last3=Rudolf|first3=Andreas|title=Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|journal=Energy|date=May 2011|volume=36|pages=2328–2342|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At these temperatures and pressures, the water present in the biomass becomes either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the conditions, and acts as a solvent, reactant, and catalyst to facilitate the reaction of biomass to bio-oil.

The exact conversion of biomass to bio-oil is dependent on several variables:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Feedstock composition
* Temperature and heating rate
* Pressure
* Solvent
* Residence time
* Catalysts

===Feedstock===

Theoretically, any biomass can be converted into bio-oil using hydrothermal liquefaction regardless of water content, and various different biomasses have been tested, from forestry and agriculture residues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kosinkova|first1=Jana|last2=Ramirez|first2=Jerome|last3=Jablonsky|first3=Michal|last4=Ristovski|first4=Zoran|last5=Brown|first5=Richard|last6=Rainey|first6=Thomas|title=Energy and chemical conversion of five Australian lignocellulosic feedstocks into bio-crude through liquefaction|journal=RSC Advances|date=24 May 2017|volume=7|issue=44|page=27707-27717|doi=10.1039/C7RA02335A|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/RA/C7RA02335A}}&lt;/ref&gt;, sewage sludges, food process wastes, to emerging non-food biomass such as algae.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ToorReview"/&gt; The composition of cellulose, hemicellulose, protein, and lignin in the feedstock influence the yield and quality of the oil from the process.

===Temperature and Heating Rate===
Temperature plays a major role in the conversion of biomass to bio-oil. The temperature of the reaction determines the depolymerization of the biomass to bio-oil, as well as the repolymerization into char.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the ideal reaction temperature is dependent on the feedstock used, temperatures above ideal lead to an increase in char formation and eventually increased gas formation, while lower than ideal temperatures reduce depolymerization and overall product yields.

Similarly to temperature, the rate of heating plays a critical role in the production of the different phase streams, due to the prevalence of secondary reactions at non-optimum heating rates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Secondary reactions become dominant in heating rates that are too low, leading to the formation of char. While high heating rates are required to form liquid bio-oil, there is a threshold heating rate and temperature where liquid production is inhibited and gas production is favored in secondary reactions.

===Pressure===
Pressure (along with temperature) determines the super- or subcritical state of solvents as well as overall reaction kinetics and the energy inputs required to yield the desirable HTL products (oil, gas, chemicals, char etc.).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Residence Time===
Hydrothermal liquefaction is a fast process, resulting in low residence times for depolymerization to occur. Typical residence times are measured in minutes (15 to 60 minutes); however, the residence time is highly dependent on the reaction conditions, including feedstock, solvent ratio and temperature. As such, optimization of the residence time is necessary to ensure a complete depolymerizaiton without allowing further reactions to occur.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Catalysts===
While water acts as a catalyst in the reaction, other catalysts can be added to the reaction vessel to optimize the conversion.&lt;ref name="DuanCatalyst"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duan|first1=Peigao|last2=Savage|first2=Phillip E.|title=Hydrothermal Liquefaction of a Microalga with Heterogeneous Catalysts|journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research|date=2011|volume=50|pages=52–61|doi=10.1021/ie100758s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously used catalysts include water-soluble inorganic compounds and salts, including KOH and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as transition metal catalysts using [[Nickel|Ni]], [[Palladium|Pd]], [[Platinum|Pt]], and [[Ruthenium|Ru]] supported on either [[carbon]], [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] or [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]]. The addition of these catalysts can lead to an oil yield increase of 20% or greater, due to the catalysts converting the protein, cellulose, and hemicellulose into oil. This ability for catalysts to convert biomaterials other than fats and oils to bio-oil allows for a wider range of feedstock to be used.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Environmental Impact==
Biofuels that are produced through hydrothermal liquefaction are [[Carbon-neutral fuel|carbon neutral]], meaning that there are no net carbon emissions produced when burning the biofuel. The plant materials used to produce bio-oils use photosynthesis to grow, and as such consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The burning of the biofuels produced releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, but is nearly completely offset by the carbon dioxide consumed from growing the plants, resulting in a release of only 15-18 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh or energy produced. This is substantially lower than the releases rate of fossil fuel technologies, which can range from releases of 955 g/kWh (coal), 813 g/kWh (oil), and 446 g/kWh (natural gas).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recently, Steeper Energy announced that the [[Emission intensity|Carbon Intensity (CI)]] of its Hydrofaction™ oil is 15 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ according to [http://www.ghgenius.ca/ GHGenius model] (version 4.03a), while diesel fuel is 93.55 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq/MJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://steeperenergy.com/news/milestones-and-activities|title = Milestones &amp; Activities|date = Q3 2015|accessdate = 3 Sep 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Steeper Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrothermal liquefaction is a clean process that doesn't produce harmful compounds, such as ammonia, NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, or SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Instead the [[heteroatom]]s, including nitrogen, sulfur, and chlorine, are converted into harmless byproducts such as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and inorganic acids that can be neutralized with bases.

==Compare with Pyrolysis and other [[Biomass to liquid|BtL]] technologies==
The HTL process differs from [[pyrolysis]] as it can process wet biomass and produce a bio-oil that contains approximately twice the energy density of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis is a related process to HTL, but biomass must be processed and dried in order to increase the yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bridgwater|first1=A.V|last2=Peacocke|first2=G.V.C|title=Fast pyrolysis processes for biomass|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|date=March 2000|volume=4|pages=1–73|doi=10.1016/s1364-0321(99)00007-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of water in pyrolysis drastically increases the heat of vaporization of the organic material, increasing the energy required to decompose the biomass. Typical pyrolysis processes require a water content of less than 40% to suitably convert the biomass to bio-oil. This requires considerable pretreatment of wet biomass such as tropical grasses, which contain a water content as high as 80-85%, and even further treatment for aquatic species, which can contain higher than 90% water content.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The HTL oil can contain up to 80% of the feedstock carbon content (single pass).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; HTL oil has good potential to yield bio-oil with "drop-in" properties that can be directly distributed in existing petroleum infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction of biomass: A review of subcritical water technologies|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544211001691|journal = Energy|date = 2011-05-01|pages = 2328–2342|volume = 36|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2011.03.013|first = Saqib Sohail|last = Toor|first2 = Lasse|last2 = Rosendahl|first3 = Andreas|last3 = Rudolf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-02/au-hl020613.php|title = Hydrothermal liquefaction -- the most promising path to a sustainable bio-oil production|last = AARHUS UNIVERSITY|first = |date = 6 Feb 2013|work = |access-date = 3 Sep 2015|via = http://www.eurekalert.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[hyperbolic geometry]], an '''ideal point''', '''omega point'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sibley |first1=Thomas Q. |title=The geometric viewpoint : a survey of geometries |date=1998 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading, Mass. |isbn=0-201-87450-4 |page=109 |url=http://www.employees.csbsju.edu/tsibley/textbook.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''point at infinity''' is a [[well defined]] point outside the hyperbolic plane or space.
Given a line ''l'' and a point ''P'' not on ''l'', right- and left-[[limiting parallel]]s to ''l'' through ''P'' [[Convergence (mathematics)|converge]] to ''l'' at ''ideal points''.

Unlike the projective case, ideal points form a [[manifold with boundary|boundary]], not a submanifold. So, these lines do not ''intersect'' at an ideal point and such points, although [[well defined]], do not belong to the hyperbolic space itself.

The ideal points together form the [[Cayley absolute]] or boundary of a [[hyperbolic geometry]]. 
For instance, the [[unit circle]] forms the Cayley absolute of the [[Poincaré disk model]] and the [[Klein disk model]].
While the real line forms the Cayley absolute of the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Struve | first1=Horst | last2=Struve | first2=Rolf | title=Non-euclidean geometries: the Cayley-Klein approach |doi=10.1007/s00022-010-0053-z | mr=2739193 | year=2010 | journal=Journal of Geometry | issn=0047-2468 | volume=89 | issue=1 | pages=151–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pasch's axiom]] and the [[exterior angle theorem]] still hold for an omega triangle, defined by two points in hyperbolic space and an omega point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Hvidsten|first =Michael|title = Geometry with Geometry Explorer|publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2005 | location = New York, NY |pages = 276–283 | isbn = 0-07-312990-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

* The hyperbolic distance between an ideal point and any other point or ideal point is infinite.
* The centres of [[horocycle]]s and [[horoball]]s are ideal points; two [[horocycle]]s are [[concentric]] when they have the same centre.

==Polygons with ideal vertices==

===Ideal triangles===
{{main article|Ideal triangle}}

if all vertices of a [[hyperbolic triangle|triangle]] are ideal points the triangle is an [[ideal triangle]].

Ideal triangles have a number of interesting properties:

* All ideal triangles are congruent. 
* The interior angles of an ideal triangle are all zero.
* Any ideal triangle has an infinite perimeter.
* Any ideal triangle has area &lt;math&gt; \pi / -K &lt;/math&gt; where K is the (negative) curvature of the plane.&lt;ref name="Thurston 2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://math.berkeley.edu/~qchu/Notes/274/Lecture5.pdf | title=274 Curves on Surfaces, Lecture 5 | date=Fall 2012 | accessdate=23 July 2013 | author=Thurston, Dylan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideal quadrilaterals===

if all vertices of a [[quadrilateral]] are ideal points the quadrilateral is an ideal quadrilateral.

While all ideal triangles are congruent, not all quadrilaterals are, the diagonals can make different angles with each other resulting in noncongruent quadrilaterals
having said this:

* The interior angles of an ideal quadrilateral are all zero.
* Any ideal quadrilateral has an infinite perimeter.
* Any ideal [[convex polygon|(convex non intersecting)]] quadrilateral has area &lt;math&gt; 2 \pi / -K &lt;/math&gt; where K is the (negative) curvature of the plane.

===Ideal square===
The ideal quadrilateral where the two diagonals are [[perpendicular]] to each other form an ideal square.

It was use by [[Ferdinand Karl Schweikart]] in his memorandum on what he called "astral geometry", one of the first publications acknowledging the possibility of [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bonola|first1=Roberto|title=Non-Euclidean geometry : a critical and historical study of its developments|date=1955|publisher=Dover|location=New York, NY|isbn=0486600270|pages=75–77|edition=Unabridged and unaltered republ. of the 1. English translation 1912.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ideal ''n''-gons===
An ideal ''n''-gon can be subdivided into {{nowrap|(''n'' − 2)}} ideal triangles, with area {{nowrap|(''n'' − 2)}} times the area of an ideal triangle.

==Representations in models of hyperbolic geometry==

In the [[Klein disk model]] and the [[Poincaré disk model]] of the hyperbolic plane. In both disk models the '''ideal points''' are on the [[unit circle]] (hyperbolic plane)  or [[unit sphere]] (higher dimensions)  which is the unreachable boundary of the hyperbolic plane. 
 		  
When projecting the same hyperbolic line to the [[Klein disk model]] and the [[Poincaré disk model]] both lines go through the same two ideal points.(the ideal points in both models are on the same spot).

===Klein disk model ===

Given two distinct points ''p'' and ''q'' in the open unit disk the unique straight line connecting them intersects the unit circle in two '''ideal points''', ''a'' and ''b'', labeled so that the points are, in order, ''a'', ''p'', ''q'', ''b'' so that |aq| &gt; |ap| and |pb| &gt; |qb|. Then the hyperbolic distance between ''p'' and ''q'' is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;d(p,q) = \frac{1}{2} \log \frac{ \left| qa \right| \left| bp \right| }{ \left| pa \right| \left| bq \right| } ,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Poincaré disk model ===

Given two distinct points ''p'' and ''q'' in the open unit disk then the unique circle [[arc (geometry)|arc]] orthogonal to the boundary  connecting them intersects the unit circle in two '''ideal points''', ''a'' and ''b'', labeled so that the points are, in order, ''a'', ''p'', ''q'', ''b'' so that |aq| &gt; |ap| and |pb| &gt; |qb|. Then the hyperbolic distance between ''p'' and ''q'' is expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;d(p,q) =  \log \frac{ \left| qa \right| \left| bp \right| }{ \left| pa \right| \left| bq \right| } ,&lt;/math&gt;

Where the distances are measured along the (straight line) segments aq, ap, pb and qb.

===Poincaré half-plane model===
In the [[Poincaré half-plane model]] the  '''ideal points''' are the points on the boundary axis. There is also another ideal point that is not represented in the half-plane model (but rays parallel to the positive y-axis approach it).

===Hyperboloid model===
In the [[hyperboloid model]] there are no '''ideal points'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17224">'''''Indriya''''' (literally "belonging to or agreeable to [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Indra]]") is the [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]] term for physical strength or ability in general, and for the senses more specifically.
In [[Buddhism]], the term refers to multiple intrapsychic processes and is generally translated as "faculty" or, in specific contexts, as "spiritual faculty" or "controlling principle."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000) translates ''indriya'' as "spiritual faculty" and, at times (particularly when referring to Abhidhammic sources), "faculty."  Buddhaghosa &amp; Ñāṇamoli (1999) consistently translate ''indriya'' simply as "faculty" both in the context of the five spiritual faculties (e.g., pp. 128-9) and the 22 phenomenological faculties (Ch. XVI).  Conze (1993) mentions and uses translations of "faculty," "controlling faculty" and "spiritual faculty," and refers to the five ''indriya'' as "cardinal virtues."  Thanissaro (1998) uses "faculty."  Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 122-123, [http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:3218.pali entry for "Indriya," (retrieved 2007-05-27)] defines it as: "Indriya is one of the most comprehensive &amp; important categories of Buddhist psychological philosophy &amp; ethics, meaning 'controlling principle, directive force, élan, dynamis'...: (a) with reference to sense-perceptibility 'faculty, function'...."&lt;/ref&gt; 
The term literally means "belonging to [[Indra]]," chief deity in the [[Rig Veda]] and lord of the [[Trāyastriṃśa]] heaven (also known as [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra or Sakka]] in Buddhism) hence connoting supremacy, dominance and control, attested in the general meaning of "power, strength" from the ''Rig Veda''.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), p. 1509&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conze (1993), ''n''. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 122, entry "indriya"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro (1998), Part II, sec. E, "The Five Faculties."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism, depending on the context, ''indriya'' traditionally refers to one of the following groups of faculties:
* the 5 spiritual faculties
* the 5 or 6 sensory faculties
* the 22 phenomenological faculties

== 5 spiritual faculties ==
In the [[Pali Canon]]'s [[Sutta Pitaka]], ''indriya'' is frequently encountered in the context of the "five spiritual faculties" (Pali: ''{{IAST|pañc' indriyāni}}''):
:# faith or conviction or belief (''[[saddha|{{IAST|saddhā}}]]'')
:# energy or persistence or perseverance (''[[viriya]]'')
:# [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] or memory (''sati'')
:# stillness of the mind (''{{IAST|[[samādhi]]}}'')
:# wisdom or understanding or comprehension (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|{{IAST|pañña}}]]'').
Together, this set of five faculties is one of the seven sets of qualities lauded by [[the Buddha]] as [[Bodhipakkhiyadhamma|conducive to Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;While the Pali [[atthakatha|commentaries]] consistently use the term ''[[bodhipakkhiyā dhammā]]'' ("states conducive to enlightenment") to refer to ''seven sets'' of enlightenment qualities (i.e., the four [[satipatthana|frames of reference]], [[four right exertions]], four bases of power, five faculties, [[five powers]], seven [[bojjhanga]], and [[Noble Eightfold Path]]) (see, e.g., Bodhi, 2000, p. 1937, ''n''. 235), a search of the Sinhala SLTP tipitaka (using La Trobe University's search engine at {{cite web|url=http://www.chaf.lib.latrobe.edu.au/dcd/pali.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001234/http://www.chaf.lib.latrobe.edu.au/dcd/pali.htm |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}) finds the Pali phrase ''bodhipakkhiyā dhammā'' occurring only once in the early suttas: in the ''Sālā Sutta'' ([[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 48.51) where the term references solely these five spiritual faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration and wisdom (Bodhi, 2000, p. 1695).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 48.10 is one of several discourses that characterizes these spiritual faculties in the following manner:
:* '''Faith/conviction''' is faith in the Buddha's [[bodhi|awakening]].&lt;ref&gt;Alternatively, [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 48.8 and [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] V.15 identify "faith" as referring to the four-fold faith of the stream-enterer which Conze (1993), ''n''. 28, and Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi (1999), p. 297, ''n''. 9, identify as faith in the [[Triple Gem]] and [[Śīla|"perfect morality."]]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* '''Energy/persistence''' refers to exertion towards the [[Four Right Efforts]].
:* '''Mindfulness''' refers to focusing on the four [[satipatthana]].
:* '''Stillness of the mind''' refers to achieving the four [[jhana]]s.
:* '''Wisdom/understanding''' refers to discerning the [[Four Noble Truths]].&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), pp. 1671-73; and, Thanissaro (1997a).&lt;/ref&gt;

In SN 48.51, the Buddha declares that, of these five faculties, wisdom is the "chief" (''agga'').&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), p. 1695.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Balancing the spiritual faculties ===
In [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 6.55, the Buddha counsels a discouraged monk, Sona, to balance or "tune" his spiritual faculties as one would a musical instrument:
:"... what do you think: when the strings of your [lute] were neither too taut nor too loose, but tuned to be right on pitch, was your [lute] in tune &amp; playable?"

:"Yes, lord."

:"In the same way, Sona, over-aroused persistence leads to restlessness, overly slack persistence leads to laziness. Thus you should determine the right pitch for your persistence, attune the pitch of the [five] faculties [to that], and there pick up your theme."&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro (1997b).  See also Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi (1999), pp. 168-70.  Following Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi, the Pali word ''{{IAST|vīṇā}}'' (which Thanissaro leaves untranslated) is translated here as "lute"; other square-bracketed phrases are from Thanissaro (1997b).  In Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi (1999), they translate this excerpt's last line as: "Therefore, So{{IAST|ṇ}}a, keep your energy in balance, penetrate to a balance of the spiritual faculties, and there seize your object."  In the associated end note (pp. 301-2, n. 31), they provide the commentary's interpretation of "object" (''nimitta'') as: "When such balance exists, the object can arise clearly, just like the reflection of the face in a mirror; and you should seize this object, be it of tranquillity, insight, path or fruition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the ''Aggi Sutta'' ("Fire Discourse," [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 46.53) in which, within the context of the seven [[bojjhanga|enlightenment factors]], the Buddha counsels that one should develop energy (and other factors) when experiencing a sluggish mind and develop concentration (and other factors) when experiencing an excited mind (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 1605-7).&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatedly, the [[Visuddhimagga]] and other post-canonical [[Atthakatha|Pali commentaries]]&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in an end note associated with [[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 6.55, Nyanaponika &amp; Bodhi (1999, pp. 301-2, n. 31) reference the ''{{IAST|Aṅguttara Aṭṭhakathā}}'' (AN commentary).&lt;/ref&gt; caution against one spiritual faculty overpowering and inhibiting the other four faculties, and thus generally recommend modifying the overpowering faculty with the investigation of states (see ''[[dhamma vicaya]]'') or the development of tranquillity (''[[samatha]]'').  Moreover, these commentaries especially recommend that the five spiritual faculties be developed in counterbalancing dyads:

* "For one strong in '''faith''' and weak in understanding has confidence uncritically and groundlessly.  One strong in '''understanding''' and weak in faith errs on the side of cunning and is as hard to cure as one sick of a disease caused by medicine.  With the balancing of the two a man has confidence only when there are grounds for it." ([[Visuddhimagga|Vism.]] Ch. IV, §47, ¶1)
* "... [I]dleness overpowers one strong in '''concentration''' and weak in '''energy''', since concentration favours idleness.  Agitation overpowers one strong in energy and weak in concentration, since energy favours agitation.  But concentration coupled with energy cannot lapse into idleness, and energy coupled with concentration cannot lapse into agitation.  So these two should be balanced ; for [[jhana|absorption]] comes with the balancing of the two." ([[Visuddhimagga|Vism.]] Ch. IV, §47, ¶2)
* "... One working on '''concentration''' needs strong '''faith''', since it is with such faith and confidence that he reaches absorption." ([[Visuddhimagga|Vism.]] Ch. IV, §48)
* "... Then there is [balancing of] '''concentration''' and '''understanding'''.  One working on concentration needs strong [[Ekaggata|unification]], since that is how he reaches [[jhana|absorption]]; and one working on [[vipassana|insight]] needs strong understanding, since that is how he reaches penetration of [[Three marks of existence|characteristics]]; but with the balancing of the two he reaches absorption as well." ([[Visuddhimagga|Vism.]] Ch. IV, §48)
The commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] adds:
* "Strong '''mindfulness''', however, is needed in all instances; for mindfulness protects the mind lapsing into agitation through faith, energy and understanding, which favour agitation, and from lapsing into idleness through concentration, which favours idleness." ([[Visuddhimagga|Vism.]] Ch. IV, §49).&lt;ref&gt;Direct quotes from the Visuddhimagga are from Buddhaghosa &amp; {{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} (1999), pp. 128-9.  Also mentioned in Bodhi (2000), p. 1511; and, Conze (1993), Part II, sec. 5, "The Balance of the Faculties."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relation to the Five Powers===
In [[Samyutta Nikaya|SN]] 48.43, the Buddha declares that the five spiritual faculties are the [[Five Powers]] and vice versa.  He uses the metaphor of a stream passing by a mid-stream island; the island creates two streams, but the streams can also be seen as one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), pp. 1688-89.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Atthakatha|Pali commentaries]] remark that these five qualities are "faculties" when used to control their spheres of influence, and are "powers" when unshakeable by opposing forces.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), p. 1511.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 5 material or 6 sensory faculties ==
In the Sutta Pitaka, six sensory faculties are referenced in a manner similar to the [[salayatana|six sense bases]].  These faculties consist of the [[sense|five senses]] with the addition of "mind" or "thought" ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]).
:# vision (''cakkh-indriya'')
:# hearing (''sot-indriya'')
:# smell ({{IAST|''ghān-indriya''}})
:# taste  (''jivh-indriya'')
:# touch ({{IAST|''kāy-indriya''}})
:# thought (''man-indriya'')
The first five of these faculties are sometimes referenced as the five material faculties (e.g., ''{{IAST|pañcannaṃ indriyānaṃ avakanti}}'').&lt;ref&gt;Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), pp. 122-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== 22 phenomenological faculties ==
In the [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]], the notion of ''indriya'' is expanded to the twenty-two "phenomenological faculties" or "controlling powers" (Pali: ''{{IAST|bāvīsati indriyāni}}'')&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (2000), pp. 1508-1509, refers to these 22 faculties as "phenomenological faculties"; while Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), p. 122-3, entry on "indriya" refers to these 22 faculties as "controlling powers."&lt;/ref&gt; which are:
* six sensory faculties
:# eye/vision faculty (''cakkh-undriya'')
:# ear/hearing faculty (''sot-indriya'')
:# nose/smell faculty ({{IAST|''ghān-indriya''}})
:# tongue/taste faculty (''jivh-indriya'')
:# body/sensibility faculty ({{IAST|''kāy-indriya''}})
:# mind faculty (''man-indriya'')
* three physical faculties
:# femininity (''itth-indriya'')
:# masculinity (''puris-indriya'')
:# life or vitality ({{IAST|''jīvit-indriya''}})
* five feeling faculties&lt;ref&gt;The five feeling faculties are essentially an expanded scale of the three [[vedana]], where pleasant and unpleasant feelings/sensations are divided between physical and mental experiences (see, e.g., Bodhi, 2000, p. 1510).&lt;/ref&gt;
:# physical pleasure (''sukh-indriya'')
:# physical pain (''dukkh-indriya'')
:# mental joy (''somanassa-indriya'')
:# mental grief (''domanass-indriya'')
:# equanimity (''upekhha-indriya'')
* five spiritual faculties
:# faith (''[[saddha|{{IAST|saddh-indriya}}]]'')
:# energy (''[[vīriya|viriy-indriya]]'')
:# [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] (''sat-indriya'')
:# concentration (''{{IAST|[[samādhi]]-indriya}}'')
:# wisdom (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|{{IAST|paññ}}]]-indriya'')
* three final-knowledge faculties
:# thinking "I shall know the unknown" (''{{IAST|anaññāta-ñassāmīt-indriya}}'')
:# gnosis (''{{IAST|aññ-indriya}}'')
:# one who knows (''{{IAST|aññātā-vindriya}}'')

According to the post-canonical [[Visuddhimagga]], the 22 faculties along with such constructs as the [[Skandha|aggregates]], [[Ayatana|sense bases]], [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Dependent Origination]] are the "soil" of wisdom (''[[Wisdom in Buddhism|{{IAST|paññā}}]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Buddhaghosa &amp; {{IAST|Ñāṇamoli}} (1999), pp. 442-443.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other faculty groupings ==
At times in the Pali Canon, different discourses or Abhidhammic passages will refer to different subsets of the 22 phenomenological faculties.  Thus, for instance, in the [[Abhidhamma]] there are references to the "eightfold [[rūpa|form]]-faculty" (''{{IAST|aṭṭhavidhaṃ indriya-rūpaṃ}}'') which includes the first five sensory faculties (eye, ear, nose, tongue and body faculties) plus the three physical faculties (femininity, masculinity and vitality).&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, [[Dhammasangani|Dhs.]] 709-717, 971-973 (Rhys Davids, 2003, pp. 215-217, 247); and, Rhys Davids &amp; Stede (1921-25), pp. 122-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==See also==
* [[Ayatana]] (sense base)
* [[Bodhi]] (awakening, enlightenment)
* [[Bodhipakkhiyadhamma]] (37 enlightenment qualities)
* [[Five Powers]]
* [[Four Right Exertions|Four Right Efforts]]
* [[Wisdom in Buddhism|Prajna]] (wisdom)
* [[Salayatana]] (six sense bases)

'''John Preston Davis''' (January 19, 1905 &amp;ndash; September 11, 1973) was an American journalist, lawyer and activist intellectual, who became prominent for his work with the [[Joint Committee on National Recovery]]. He co-founded the [[National Negro Congress]] in 1935, which was affiliated with the Communist Party of America.

He founded ''Our World'' magazine in 1946, a full-size, nationally distributed magazine edited for African-American readers. He also published the ''American Negro Reference Book,'' covering virtually every aspect of African-American life, present and past.

==Biography==
John P. Davis was born in Washington, D.C., the son of [[Dr. William Henry Davis]] and Julia Davis. His father was a graduate of [[Howard University]] and served as principal of Armstrong High School. During [[World War I]], Dr. Davis was appointed as Secretary to Dr. [[Emmett Jay Scott]], Special Assistant to the [[United States Secretary of War]]. In the 1920s, Dr. Davis served as Secretary to the Presidential Commission investigating the economic conditions in the [[Virgin Islands]].

==The early years==
Davis attended segregated schools in Washington, D.C., graduating from the elite Dunbar High School, which stressed an academic curriculum. In 1922 he enrolled in [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]]. He graduated in 1926, earning an A.B. and double honors in English and Psychology. At Bates, Davis was president of [[Delta Sigma Rho-Tau Kappa Alpha#Delta Sigma Rho|Delta Sigma Rho]], an honorary debating fraternity, and editor of the student publication ''The Bobcat''.

Davis toured Europe with the Bates College debating team. He was among the first African-American men to be sent overseas under the auspices of the American University Union to engage in international debate; his team from Bates met and defeated Cambridge University. While he was an undergraduate at Bates College, Davis was nominated for a [[Rhodes scholarship]]. He contributed short stories to the magazines, ''[[The Crisis]]'' and ''Opportunity,'' published by the [[NAACP]].
 
With his literary interests, Davis was drawn into the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. After college, he moved to New York City, where for a time, he replaced the celebrated scholar [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] as literary editor of ''The Crisis''. During this period, Davis joined with other young black writers &amp;ndash; [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Gwendolyn Bennett]], [[Wallace Thurman]], [[Aaron Douglas]], [[Richard Bruce Nugent|Richard Bruce]] &amp;ndash; to produce ''[[Fire!!]]'', a magazine devoted to young African-American artists.

==Harvard University==
Davis had a fellowship to Harvard University from 1926 to 1927, and earned his master's degree in Journalism. He left Harvard to join the staff of [[Fisk University]], a [[historically black college]] in Nashville, where he served as Director of Publicity from (1927 to 1928). He returned to [[Harvard University]] and earned an LLB degree from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1933.

At Harvard, Davis cemented lifelong friendships with a small core of black students, including fellow Dunbar High School alumni [[Robert C. Weaver]], later appointed as the first black member of a Presidential cabinet; [[William H. Hastie|William Hastie]], later appointed as the first black federal judge; and [[Ralph Bunche]], later a statesman and diplomat who was awarded a [[Nobel Prize for Peace]].

These friends remained important throughout his career. During their student years, the men discussed race and politics, especially the inadequacy of the black Republican leadership. When the [[Great Depression]] intensified the social and economic problems confronting black America, Davis and his colleagues looked to the example of Reconstruction, when federal power was used to redress the plight of former slaves. They called on the federal government to ensure black civil and political rights. The [[New Deal]] of Franklin D. Roosevelt seemed to offer the possibility of federal intervention for economic justice.

==Marriage and family==
Davis married Marguerite DeMond, the daughter of [[Reverend Abraham Lincoln DeMond]] and Lula Watkins (Patterson) DeMond. She had attended Avery Normal Institute in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], operated by the [[American Missionary Association]] and the Congregationalist Church. Even before the Civil War, Avery Normal Institute's racially integrated faculty was providing quality educations for African Americans. She attended [[Syracuse University]] in 1931 and came to Washington, D.C., with her mother in 1932, after the death of her father.

Marguerite DeMond went to work as a researcher for African-American historian [[Carter G. Woodson]]'s [[Association for the Study of African American Life and History]]. After a one-year courtship, she and Davis were married. They had four children, including [[Michael DeMond Davis]], who became a journalist who authored Black American Women in Olympic track and Field and the [[Thurgood Marshall]] biography.

==Joint Committee for National Recovery==
In the summer of 1933 John P. Davis, a law graduate, and Robert C. Weaver, a doctoral student at Harvard, acted to ensure that African-American interests were represented in government programs. The two men returned to Washington, D.C. and established an office on Capitol Hill, where they fought successfully against the racial wage differential and for the integration of Negro families into the program of the Homestead Subsistence Division in the first recovery program.

Davis and Weaver organized the [[Negro Industrial League]] to pressure New Deal agencies to address the needs of blacks. They monitored the hearings of the [[National Recovery Administration]] to ensure that blacks benefited from the program.

Their efforts led to the establishment of the [[Joint Committee on National Recovery]], a group of twenty-six national groups, including the [[YWCA]], [[National Urban League]] (NUL), and the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). Davis became Executive Secretary of the JCNR, a position he held until 1936, serving as a legislative lobbyist. The committee lobbied for fair inclusion of African Americans in government-sponsored programs. It publicized incidents and patterns of racial discrimination. The implementation of a National Recovery Program promised to have immediate and long-term consequences for African Americans. While Davis and Weaver worked, more established African-American leaders deliberated about how to respond to the flurry of New Deal legislation.

==National Negro Congress==
In May 1935 a conference on the economic status of the Negro was held at [[Howard University]] in Washington, D.C., out of which emerged a major civil rights coalition that was active in the late 1930s and 1940s. The National Negro Congress—whose sponsors included Davis, [[Ralph J. Bunche]] and [[Alain Locke]] of Howard University, [[A. Philip Randolph]] of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]], [[James W. Ford|James Ford]] of the [[Communist Party]], [[Lester Granger]] and Elmer Carter of the Urban League, and [[Charles Hamilton Houston]] of the NAACP—was significant in two respects.&lt;!--what two?--&gt; Davis was one of the original founders; he served as Executive Secretary until 1942.

The NNC represented one of the first efforts of the 20th century to bring together under one umbrella black secular leaders, preachers, labor organizers, workers, businessmen, radicals, and professional politicians, with the assumption that the common denominator of race could weld together such divergent segments of black society. It was the Communist Party’s effort to build support among activists in the black mainstream. The evolution of the [[National Negro Congress]] dramatized the growing convergence of outlook between Communists and activist black intellectuals that had taken shape in the protests of the early Depression years and reached full fruition during the years of the [[Popular Front]].

In 1943 Davis brought the first lawsuit challenging segregated schools in Washington, D.C., in the name of his five-year-old son Michael D. Davis, who was rejected from his neighborhood's Noyes School, a white elementary school. The ''Washington Star'' criticized the African-American lawyer for legally challenging the District's dual segregated school system after the principal of Noyes School refused to admit Mike Davis. The ''Washington Star'' paper said that District citizens had long accepted separate schools for blacks and whites, and that the suit brought by John P. Davis would cause deeper racial divisions in the nation's capital.

In response to Davis' suit, the US Congress appropriated federal funds to construct the Lucy D. Slowe elementary school, for African-American children, directly across the street from his [[Brookland, Washington, D.C.|Brookland]] neighborhood home. At that time, a committee of Congress directly administered District government.

==''Our World'' magazine==
After World War II, in 1946 Davis was founding publisher of ''Our World'' magazine, a full-size, nationally distributed magazine to appeal to African-American readers. Its first issue, with singer-actress [[Lena Horne]] on the cover, appeared on the nation's newsstands in April 1946. ''Our World'' was a premier publication, covering contemporary topics from black history to sports and entertainment, with regular articles on health, fashion, politics and social awareness. It was based in New York City, the publishing capital of the country.

''Our World'' portrayed a thriving black America; its covers featured entertainers such as [[Lena Horne]], [[Marian Anderson]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Nat King Cole]].

==''The American Negro Reference Book''==
In 1964 Davis served as editor of special publications for the [[Phelps-Stokes Fund]]. He compiled in a single volume a reliable summary on the main aspects of Negro life in America, presenting it with historical depth to provide the reader with a true perspective. ''The American Negro Reference Book'' covered virtually every aspect of African-American life, present and past.

==Papers and collections==
The largest collection of Davis' papers is in the [[Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture]], [[New York Public Library]]. Insight into Davis' political and social views can be found in his own writings. ''The Papers of the National Negro Congress'' reproduces all of the organization’s records that are housed at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, including the voluminous working files of Davis and successive executive secretaries of the National Negro Congress. Beginning with papers from 1933 that predate the formation of the National Negro Congress, the wide-ranging collection documents Davis’ involvement in the Negro Industrial League. It includes the "Report Files" of Davis’ interest in the "Negro problem."

The most extensive overview of Davis' life is by Hilmar Jenson in an edition of his writings, John Preston Davis, ''The Forgotten Civil Rights'' (1996). Much of the scholarly writing about Davis focuses on his experiences in the National Negro Congress.

Artifacts and papers of Davis are being acquired by the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African-American History and Culture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8199">The '''legal system of [[Azerbaijan]]''' is based on [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html Azerbaijan], [[CIA World Factbook]]&lt;/ref&gt; As the country was a [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]] until 1991, its legal history has also been influenced heavily by [[socialist law]]. However, after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], Azerbaijan became independent by enactment of the constitutional act of national independence on October 18, 1991. 
&lt;ref name="judicialcouncil.gov.az"&gt;http://www.judicialcouncil.gov.az/Meqaleler/Fikrat_Mammadov_e11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan started reformation of the legal system by the establishing of democratic reforms. This was followed by the adoption of the first [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] in 1995 which is the foundation of the legislative system of the modern country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Azerbaijan.html#_1._The_Legal_System%20of%20the%20Republic&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] creates the system of presidential republic with a [[separation of powers]] among the Legislative, Executive and Judicial branches of the government in order to prevent abuse of power.&lt;ref&gt;ghttp://azerbaijan.az/portal/General/Constitution/doc/constitution_e.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
The term civil law in Azerbaijan refers to [[private law]], which is opposed to the [[common law]] system of [[Criminal law]] and [[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]]. The major body of statutes and laws governing civil law and procedure are set out in the Civil Code of Azerbaijan, established in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.azpromo.az/uploads/legislation/Civil_code_eng_51b1e34e863c1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal law==
The current Criminal Code of Azerbaijan came into force in September 2000, replacing the older Criminal Code of 1960 which had been based on the principles of [[Soviet law]].&lt;ref name="llex1"&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#legislative%20system The Basic Structure of the Azerbaijan Legislative System]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 1 of the Criminal Code states that "the Criminal legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan consists of this Code. New laws defining criminal responsibility are subject to inclusion in this Code";&lt;ref name="llex1"/&gt; this is characteristic of [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems such as [[France]] and [[Italy]]. In 1998 Azerbaijan was the first country in the Orient to abolish the [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="judicialcouncil.gov.az"/&gt;

==Sources of law==
Unlike [[common law]] systems such as the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], Azerbaijani courts do not rely extensively on [[case law]] and judicial [[precedent]]. Except for decisions of the [[Constitutional Court]] of Azerbaijan, decisions of the courts are not usually counted as a source of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#case%20law Case Law in Azerbaijan]&lt;/ref&gt; The sources of law in the Azerbaijani legal system are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llrx.com/features/azerbaijan.htm#sources%20of%20law Sources of Azerbaijani law]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]].
*Acts adopted via [[referendum]].
*[[Laws]] passed by the [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan]], Azerbaijan's [[legislature]].
*[[Decree]]s.
*Resolutions of the [[Cabinet of Ministers]].
*International [[treaties]] to which Azerbaijan is a party.

==Court system==
The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of Azerbaijan is a supreme judicial body on civil, criminal and other cases related to the execution of general and specialized courts. The [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan]] is the supreme body of constitutional justice on the matters attributed to its jurisdiction by the Constitution, with authority to interpret and apply the [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]].

The 1995 constitution provides for public trials in most cases, the presumption of innocence in criminal cases, and a defendant’s right to legal counsel. Both defendants and prosecutors have the right of appeal. In practice, however, the courts are politically oriented, seeming to overlook the government’s human rights violations. In July 1993, [[Heydar Aliyev]] ousted the Supreme Court chief justice because of alleged political loyalties to the opposition. The president directly appoints lower level judges. The president also appoints the Constitutional Court and Supreme Court judges with confirmation by the legislature. Prosecutors (procurators) are appointed by the president with confirmation by the legislature. The [[minister of justice]] organizes prosecutors into offices at the district, municipal, and republic levels. The constitution provides equal status for prosecutors and defense attorneys before the courts, but in practice the arrest and investigatory powers of the prosecutors have dominant influence before the courts. Judges will often remand a case for further prosecutory investigation rather than render an innocent verdict. Investigations often rely on obtaining confessions rather than on gathering evidence.

The Azerbaijan [[Government of Azerbaijan|government’s]] [[human rights]] record is poor, although some public policy debate is allowed and human rights organizations operate. The government restricts freedom of assembly, religion, and association. Numerous cases of arbitrary arrest, beatings (some resulting in deaths), unwarranted searches and seizures, and other human rights abuses are reported. Political oppositionists are harassed and arrested, and there are dozens of political prisoners in Azerbaijan. The conflict between  [[Armenia]]ns and Azerbaijanis contributed to widespread human rights violations by both sides. Some opposition newspapers are allowed to exist.

== Legal Reforms ==
{{Main|Legal reform in Azerbaijan}}
After gaining of independence Azerbaijani legal system has undergone fundamental reforms. An important part of the legal reforms in the country is related to adoption of a new Constitution in Azerbaijan in 1995. Since that Constitution was amended three times in 2002, 2009 and 2016.  Adoption of the Constitution has been followed by reforms related to progressive legislative acts such as, "The Law on Constitutional court", "The Law on Courts and Judges", "The Law on Police", "The Law on Operational-investigational activity", Law Judicial Legal Council, Criminal and Civil Procedure Codes and etc. Moreover, there have been made a number of amendements to the Civil Code, the Code of Civil Procedure, the Criminal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judicialcouncil.gov.az/e_mehkeme_ve_huquq.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal reforms introduced new three stage - first instance, appelate and supreme court system in Azerbaijan and ensured its independence from other branches of power. At present, there are district (city) courts acts as the first degree of jurisdictional courts, military courts and local administrative-economic courts as territorial jurisdictional courts, also Court of Azerbaijan Republic on Felonies and Court of Azerbaijan on Grave Military Crimes.

The Supreme Court of Azerbaijan Republic is cassation degree of jurisdiction and consists of 4 chambers - Civil Chamber, Criminal Chamber, Military Chamber and Administrative-Economic Chamber. Court hearings are public, and defendants are free to choose their own attorney and have the right to appeal the verdict. In cases involving national security or other defined by law a judge may decide to hold a closed trial.

Azerbaijan as a member of the Council of Europe ratificated [[European Convention on Human Rights]] . Further, Azerbaijani ''individuals, group of individuals and non-governmental organisations'' can refer cases to the ECHR.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9709">The '''marginal propensity to save''' ('''MPS''') is the fraction of an increase in [[income]] that is not spent on an increase in [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. That is, the marginal propensity to save is the proportion of each additional dollar of household income that is used for [[saving]]. It is the slope of the line plotting saving against income.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, O. (2006). Macroeconomics. (Fourth ed., p. 59). Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a household earns one extra dollar, and the marginal propensity to save is 0.35, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Likewise, it is the fractional decrease in saving that results from a decrease in income.

The MPS plays a central role in [[Keynesian economics]] as it quantifies the saving-income relation, which is the flip side of the consumption-income relation, and according to [[Keynes]] it reflects the [[fundamental psychological law]]. The marginal propensity to save is also a key variable in determining the value of the [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]].

==Calculation==

MPS can be calculated as the change in savings divided by the change in income.

:&lt;math&gt;MPS=\frac{\text{Change in Savings}}{\text{Change in Income}}&lt;/math&gt;

Or mathematically, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) function is expressed as the derivative of the savings (S) function with respect to [[disposable income]] (Y).

:&lt;math&gt;MPS=\frac{dS}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;  where, dS=Change in Savings and dY=Change in income.

===An example===

::{| class="wikitable"
|-
! width=20%| 
!! width=40%| Saving
!! width=40%| Income
|-
| align="center" | A
| align="center" | 200
| align="center" | 1000
|-
| align="center" | B
| align="center" | 400
| align="center" | 1500
|}

Now, MPS can be calculated as follows:

: '''Change in savings''' = (400-200) = 200

: '''Change in income''' = (1500-1000) = 500

MPS = (Change in savings) / (Change in income)
  
: so, MPS = 200/500 = '''0.4'''

This implies that for each additional one unit of income, the savings increase by 0.4.

There are different implications of this above-mentioned formula.

* First it quantifies induced savings.Induced saving is the portion of saving that responds to changes in income.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Marks,  [http://www.agsm.edu.au/bobm/teaching/MM/lect04.pdf "Macroeconomics for manager"], Lecture Series, March 1997, Australian Graduate School of Management, University of New South Wales&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, induced saving can be defined as the household saving that depends on income or production (especially disposable income, national income, or even gross domestic product).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=induced+saving "Induced Savings"], AmosWEB LLC, Economic WEB*pedia,2010-2011.[Accessed: November 8, 2011] Web.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Second, it is a measure of slope of the savings function.

====Value====

Since MPS is measured as ratio of change in savings to change in income, its value lies between 0 and 1.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, O. (2006). Macroeconomics. (Fourth ed., p. 59). Pearson Education Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
Also, marginal propensity to save is opposite of marginal propensity to consume.

Mathematically, in a closed economy, '''MPS + MPC = 1''',&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, G., &amp; Yeuh, L. (2006). Macroeconomics. (p. 23). Italy: Thomson Learning Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahuja, H. L. (2008). Macroeconomics : Theories and policies. (14th ed., pp. 125-126). Delhi: S.Chand and Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; since an increase in one unit of income will be either consumed or saved.

In the above example, If MPS = 0.4, then MPC = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Generally, it is assumed that value of marginal propensity to save for the richer is more than the marginal propensity to save for the poorer. If income increases for both parties by $1, then the propensity to save for a richer person would be more than that for the poorer person.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, C. (2000) Why do the rich save so much, in Does Atlas Shrug? Economic Consequences of Taxing the Rich, Slemrod, J. (Ed.), Cambridge University Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slope of saving line==

Marginal propensity to save is also used as an alternative term for slope of saving line.
The slope of a saving line is given by the equation S = -a + (1-b)Y,&lt;ref&gt;Froyan, R. T. (2005). Macroeconomics : Theories and policies. (Eighth ed., p. 123,130). Pearson Education Inc. Pvt. Ltd. and Dorling Kindersley Publishing Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwivedi, D. N. (2005). Macroeconomics: Theory and policy. (2nd ed., p. 73). New York: Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; where -a refers to autonomous savings and (1-b) refers to marginal propensity to save (here b refers to marginal propensity to consume but as MPC + MPS = 1, so (1-b) refers to MPS).

In this diagram, the savings function is an increasing function of disposable income i.e. savings increase as income increases.&lt;ref&gt;Dornbusch, R., Fischer, S., &amp; Startz, R. (2004). Macroeconomics. (Ninth ed., pp. 217,221-23). New York: Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The savings function.png|thumb|The savings function]]

==Multiplier effect==

An important implication of marginal propensity to save is measurement of the multiplier. A multiplier measures the magnified change in aggregate product i.e. the gross domestic product, resulting from a change in an autonomous variable (for example, government expenditure, investment expenditures, etc.).

The  effect of a change in production creates a multiplied impact because it creates income which further creates consumption. However, the resulting consumption is also an expenditure which thus, generates more income, which creates more consumption. This next round of consumption leads to a further change in production, which generates even more income, and which induces even more consumption.

And thus, as it goes on and on, it results in a magnified, multiplied change in aggregate production initially triggered by a change in autonomous variable, but amplified by the creation of more income and increase in consumption.

===Mathematical implication===
Mathematically, the above effect can be stated as:

* In round 1, there is a change in an autonomous variable (say the government invests in a bridge making project for which it approaches a construction company) by an amount $1 (just an assumption for simplification). Now let the marginal propensity to consume for the construction company be 'c'. Thus, the construction company would spend an amount c×$1 i.e. $c.
* In round 2, the construction company incurs expenditure ($c) by procuring raw materials, say cement, steel, gravel, mortar, etc. from respective companies and thus, this amount $c becomes income for these companies. Now again the marginal propensity to consume for these companies is same as the construction company at 'c' and thus, their consumption becomes c×$c i.e. $c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
And it goes on and on.
We can express this as:

::{| class="wikitable"
|-
!width=20% |Round
!!width=40% |Change in income 
!!width=40% |Amount consumed
|-
| align="center"|Round 1 
| align="center"|$1 
| align="center"|$c
|-
| align="center"|Round 2
| align="center"|$c 
| align="center"|$c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| align="center"|Round 3 
| align="center"|$c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 
| align="center"|$c&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|}

:: And so on.

The end result is a magnified, multiplied change in aggregate production initially triggered by the change in investment, but amplified by the change in consumption i.e. the initial investment multiplied by the consumption coefficient (Marginal Propensity to consume).

The MPS enters into the process because it indicates the division of extra income between consumption and saving. It determines how much saving is induced with each change in production and income, and thus how much consumption is induced. If the MPS is smaller, then the multiplier process is also greater as less saving is induced, but more consumption is induced, with each round of activity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=marginal%20propensity%20to%20save&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in this highly simplified model, total magnified change in production  due to change in an autonomous variable by $1
                  = &lt;math&gt;1 + c + c^2 + \cdots
                  =\frac{1}{1-c}
                  =\frac{1}{1-MPC} = \frac{1}{MPS}&lt;/math&gt;

===Measuring the multiplier===

The effect of a [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier effect]] can be measured as:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Spending Multiplier} =\frac{1}{MPS}&lt;/math&gt;

If the MPS is smaller, then the multiplier process is also greater as less saving is induced, and more consumption is induced with each round of activity.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlin, G., &amp; Yeuh, L. (2006). Macroeconomics. (p. 23). Italy: Thomson Learning Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if MPS = 0.2, then multiplier effect is 5, and if MPS = 0.4, then the multiplier effect is 2.5. Thus, we can see that a lower propensity to save implies a higher multiplier effect.

[[File:The Yuza-no-ki.jpg|thumb|A teaching material in [[Ashikaga Gakko]] (Japan) to teach students the importance of moderation. The cup is inclined when it's empty. When you pour water into it, it goes upright. If you pour more water, it becomes inclined again.]]

'''Moderation''' is the process of eliminating or lessening extremes.  It is used to ensure [[Assimilation (sociology)|normality]] throughout the medium on which it is being conducted.  Common uses of moderation include:
*Ensuring consistency and accuracy in the marking of [[Test (student assessment)|student assessments]].
*A [[Forum moderator|moderator]] may remove unsuitable contributions from the [[website]], [[Internet forum|forum]] or [[IRC channel]] they represent in accordance with their [[moderation system]].
*A more proactive nuance is found in the [[Methodist]] church's use of the term for the heads of its conferences.
*A [[neutron moderator]] is used to slow down [[neutron]]s in a [[nuclear reactor]].
*A way of life emphasizing perfect amounts of everything, not indulging in too much of one thing, hence moderation.

== History ==

=== Ancient Greece ===

Moderation is also a principle of life. In ancient Greece, the temple of Apollo at [[Delphi]] bore the inscription ''Meden Agan'' ({{lang|grc|μηδὲν ἄγαν}}) - 'Nothing in excess'. Doing something "in moderation" means not doing it excessively. For instance, someone who moderates their food consumption tries to eat all food groups, but limits their intake of those that may cause deleterious effects to harmless levels.

According to the [[history of science and technology|historian]] and [[sociology of science|sociologist of science]] [[Steven Shapin]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Steven Shapin]], ''Never Pure: Historical Studies of Science as if It Was Produced by People with Bodies, Situated in Time, Space, Culture, and Society, and Struggling for Credibility and Authority'', second edition, [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 2010, 568 pages, page 245 ({{ISBN|978-0801894213}}).&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Block quote|From the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]] through the [[Hippocrates|Hippocratic]] and [[Galen|Galenic]] corpus, and in the writings of such [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosophers as [[Epictetus]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], health was seen to flow from observing ''moderation'' – in exercise, in study, and in diet.}}

=== Christianity ===
[[File:Venne Merrymaking peasants.jpg|thumb|''Everything in moderation'', illustration of a [[proverb]] by [[Adriaen van de Venne]], 1650s, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] in [[Warsaw]]]]
Similarly, in [[Christianity]], ''moderationism'' is the position that drinking [[alcoholic beverage]]s temperately is permissible, though [[drunkenness]] is forbidden (see [[Christianity and alcohol]]).

In the [[Book of Wisdom]] moderation is listed among the greatest virtues. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/bible/wisdom/8#7|title=scripture|website=www.usccb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taoism ===

Moderation is considered a key part of one's personal development in Chinese [[Taoist]] philosophy and religion and is one of the three jewels of Taoist thought. There is nothing that cannot be moderated including one's actions, one's desires and even one's thoughts. It is believed that by doing so one achieves a more natural state, faces less resistance in life and recognises one's limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taoism.net/articles/mason/ethics.htm#Moderation|title=Taoist Ethics|website=www.taoism.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taken to the extreme, moderation is complex and can be difficult to not only accept, but also understand and implement. It can also be recursive in that one should moderate how much one moderates (i.e. to not be too worried about moderating everything or not to try too hard in finding a middle ground)

Moderation as a principle of Taoist philosophy turns up in all three of its main texts. 

=== Others ===

Moderation is a characteristic of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] national psyche, more specifically described by the Swedish synonym [[Lagom]]. 

[[Islamic Modernism|Moderate Muslims]] adhere to the concept of contextual relativism as a way to grasp meaning from the [[Quran]].

In an [[internet forum]] a moderator is one who enforces the rules.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2643">In art, '''musivisual language''' is a [[Semiotics|semiotic]] system that is the synchronous union of music and image. The term was coined by Spanish composer [[Alejandro Román]], and for over a century, has appeared in film and other media (television, video or [[multimedia]]). 

== Definition ==
According to Román:

{{quote|''Musivisual Language'' is a special language of music placed in film and from film, understood not only from structural point of view, rhythm and sound-material, but also from the relationships and meaning semiotics in relation to the close interaction with the image and plot.'' |Román, 2008: 84}}

When film music and text connect, they produce meanings distinct from the separate elements. In this communication process, musical codes ([[melody]], rhythm, [[harmony]], sound, [[Texture (music)|texture]], [[Musical form|form]]), in synchrony with the film ([[image]], [[speech]], [[noise]]...) interact. 

Román defines two levels for this language: ''semiotic'', i.e. the contribution of meaning of music over the image, and the specific ''aesthetic'' of film music, which means it has its own stylistic elements not belonging to other musical forms. These elements are determined by the cinematic form.

'''Neurogrid''' is a piece of [[computer hardware]] that is designed specifically for [[brain simulation|simulation of biological brains]]. It uses [[analog computer|analog computation]] to emulate [[ion channel]] activity, and digital communication to softwire structured connectivity patterns. Neurogrid simulates one million [[neuron]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2014/pr-neurogrid-boahen-engineering-042814.html | title=Stanford bioengineers create circuit board modeled on the human brain | work=Stanford News Service | author=Abate, Tom | date=April 28, 2014 | accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and six billion [[synapse]]s in real time. The neurons spike at a rate of ten times a second. In terms of number of simulated neurons, it rivals simulations done by the [[Blue Brain|Blue Brain Project]]. However, by running the simulation of whole neurons, instead of simulation on molecular level, it needs only one millionth of Blue Brain's power. The entire board consumes less than two watts of electrical energy.

Neurogrid was designed and built by the ''Brains in Silicon'' group at [[Stanford university]]. The group is led by [[Kwabena Boahen]]. The Neurogrid hardware was first up and running in late 2009. Since then it has been used to start performing simulation experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1109/JPROC.2014.2313565 | volume=102 | title=Neurogrid: A Mixed-Analog-Digital Multichip System for Large-Scale Neural Simulations | journal=Proceedings of the IEEE | pages=699–716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Neurogrid board contains sixteen ''Neurocores'', each of which has 256 x 256 silicon neurons in an 11.9&amp;nbsp;mm x 13.9&amp;nbsp;mm chip. An off-chip [[Random-access memory|RAM]] and an on-chip RAM (in each Neurocore) softwire horizontal and vertical cortical connections, respectively. With 61 graded and 18 binary programmable parameters, common to all of its silicon neurons, a Neurocore can model a variety of spiking and interaction patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/brainsinsilicon/goals.html|title=Our Innovation|publisher=Stanford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4960">:''For the character in Xenosaga, see [[Gaignun Kukai]]. Nigredo is also an album by [[Diary of Dreams]].

In [[alchemy]], '''nigredo''', or blackness, means [[putrefaction]] or [[decomposition]]. Many alchemists believed that as a first step in the pathway to the [[philosopher's stone]], all alchemical ingredients had to be cleansed and cooked extensively to a uniform black matter.&lt;ref&gt;''Chemical History Tour, Picturing Chemistry from Alchemy to Modern Molecular Science'' Adele Droblas Greenberg Wiley-Interscience 2000 {{ISBN|0-471-35408-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[analytical psychology]], the term became a metaphor 'for the [[dark night of the soul]], when an individual confronts the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] within'.&lt;ref&gt;Roberte H. Hopeke, ''A Guided Tour of the Collected Works of C. G. Jung'' (Boston 1989) p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jung==

For [[Carl Jung]], 'the rediscovery of the principles of alchemy came to be an important part of my work as a pioneer of [[psychology]]'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; As a student of alchemy, he (and his followers) 'compared the "black work" of the alchemists (the nigredo) with the often highly critical involvement experienced by the ego, until it accepts the new equilibrium brought about by the creation of the self'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/shadow-analytical-psychology Hans Dieckmann, "Shadow (Analytical Psychology)"]&lt;/ref&gt; Jungians interpreted nigredo in two main psychological senses.

The first sense represented a subject's initial state of undifferentiated unawareness, 'the first nigredo, that of the ''unio naturalis'', is an objective state, visible from the outside only...an unconscious state of non-differentiation between self and object, consciousness and the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul W Ashton, ''From the Brink'' 9London 2007) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; Here the subject is unaware of the unconscious; i.e. the connection with the instincts'.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Adler, ''Studies in Analytical Psychology'' (London 1999) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second sense, 'the nigredo of the process of [[individuation]] on the other hand is a subjectively experienced process brought about by the subject's painful, growing awareness of his shadow aspects'.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, ''Brink'' p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; It could be described as a moment of maximum despair, that is a prerequisite to personal development.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C. G. ''Psychology and Alchemy'' 2nd. ed. (Transl. by R. F. C.

[[File:Coal mine Wyoming.jpg|thumb|right|325px|A [[coal mining|coal mine]] in [[Wyoming]], [[United States]]. [[Coal]], produced over millions of years, is a finite and non-renewable resource on a human time scale.]]

A '''non-renewable resource''' (also called a '''finite resource''') is a resource that does not renew itself at a sufficient rate for sustainable economic extraction in meaningful human time-frames. An example is carbon-based, organically-derived fuel. The original organic material, with the aid of heat and pressure, becomes a fuel such as oil or gas. [[Earth]] [[mineral]]s and [[metal]] [[ore]]s, [[fossil fuel]]s ([[coal]], [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]]) and [[groundwater]] in certain [[aquifer]]s are all considered non-renewable resources, though individual [[Chemical element|element]]s are almost always conserved.

On the other hand, resources such as [[timber]] (when [[Sustainable forest management|harvested sustainably]]) and wind (used to power energy conversion systems) are considered [[renewable resource]]s, largely because their localized replenishment can occur within time frames meaningful to humans.

== Earth minerals and metal ores ==
{{Main article|Mineral|Ore}}
{{Further information|Mining}}

[[Earth]] minerals and [[metal]] ores are examples of non-renewable resources. The metals themselves are present in vast amounts in Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]], and their extraction by humans only occurs where they are concentrated by [[Ore genesis|natural geological processes]] (such as heat, pressure, organic activity, weathering and other processes) enough to become economically viable to extract. These processes generally take from tens of thousands to millions of years, through [[plate tectonics]], [[tectonic subsidence]] and [[crustal recycling]].

The localized deposits of metal ores near the surface which can be extracted economically by humans are non-renewable in human time-frames. There are certain [[rare earth mineral]]s and [[rare earth element|elements]] that are more scarce and exhaustible than others. These are in high demand in [[manufacturing]], particularly for the [[electronics industry]].

Most metal ores are considered vastly greater in supply to fossil fuels, because metal ores are formed by crustal-scale processes which make up a much larger portion of the Earth's near-surface environment, than those that form fossil fuels which are limited to areas where carbon-based life forms flourish, die, and are quickly buried.

== Fossil fuels ==
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}
{{Further information|Oil depletion}}

Natural resources such as [[coal]], [[petroleum]] (crude oil) and [[natural gas]] take thousands of years to form naturally and cannot be replaced as fast as they are being consumed. Eventually it is considered that fossil-based resources will become too costly to harvest and humanity will need to shift its reliance to other sources of energy such as solar or wind power, see [[renewable energy]].

An alternative hypothesis is that carbon based fuel is virtually inexhaustible in human terms, if one includes all sources of carbon-based energy such as methane hydrates on the sea floor, which are vastly greater than all other carbon based fossil fuel resources combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/energy/methane-hydrates/ |title=Methane hydrates |website=Worldoceanreview.com |access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources of carbon are also considered non-renewable, although their rate of formation/replenishment on the sea floor is not known. However their extraction at economically viable costs and rates has yet to be determined.

At present, the main energy source used by humans is non-renewable [[fossil fuels]].  Since the dawn of [[internal combustion engine]] technologies in the 19th century, petroleum and other fossil fuels have remained in continual demand.  As a result, conventional [[infrastructure]] and [[transport]] systems, which are fitted to combustion engines, remain prominent throughout the globe.  The continual use of fossil fuels at the current rate is believed to increase [[global warming]] and cause more severe [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=America's Climate Choices: Panel on Advancing the Science of Climate Change; National Research Council|title=Advancing the Science of Climate Change |year=2010|publisher=The National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-309-14588-0|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Nuclear fuel}}
{{Further information|Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy|Peak uranium}}

In 1987, the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED) an organization set up by but independent from the [[United Nations]] classified fission reactors that produce more [[fissile]] nuclear fuel than they consume -i.e. [[breeder reactor]]s, and when it is developed, [[fusion power]], among conventional renewable energy sources, such as [[Sun|solar]] and [[Hydropower|falling water]].&lt;ref name="Brundtland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 7: Energy: Choices for Environment and Development|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-07.htm|work=Our Common Future: Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development|first=Gro Harlem|last=Brundtland|location=Oslo|date=20 March 1987|accessdate=27 March 2013|quote=Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. There are also renewable sources, including wood, plants, dung, falling water, geothermal sources, solar, tidal, wind, and wave energy, as well as human and animal muscle-power. Nuclear reactors that produce their own fuel ("breeders") and eventually fusion reactors are also in this category}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Petroleum Institute]] likewise does not consider conventional nuclear fission as renewable, but that [[breeder reactor]] nuclear power fuel is considered renewable and sustainable, before explaining that radioactive waste from used [[spent fuel]] rods remains radioactive, and so has to be very carefully stored for up to a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.api.org/classroom/curricula/nonrenew-resources.cfm|title=Key Characteristics of Nonrenewable Resources|author=American Petroleum Institute|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the careful monitoring of radioactive waste products also being required upon the use of other renewable energy sources, such as [[geothermal energy]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/radiation/tenorm/geothermal.html Geothermal Energy Production Waste.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[nuclear technology]] relying on [[Nuclear fission|fission]] requires [[Naturally occurring radioactive material]] as fuel. [[Uranium]], the most common fission fuel, and is present in the ground at relatively low concentrations and [[uranium mining|mined]] in 19 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf23.html|title=World Uranium Mining|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mined uranium is used to fuel energy-generating nuclear reactors with [[Fissile|fissionable]] [[uranium-235]] which generates heat that is ultimately used to power [[turbine]]s to generate electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/education/uran.html|title=What is uranium? How does it work?|publisher=World Nuclear Association|accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013 only a few kilograms (picture available) of uranium have been extracted from the ocean in [[pilot program]]s and it is also believed that the uranium extracted on an industrial scale from the seawater would constantly be replenished from uranium [[leaching (metallurgy)|leached]] from the ocean floor, maintaining the seawater concentration at a stable level.&lt;ref name="gepr.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gepr.org/en/contents/20130729-01/ |title= The current state of promising research into extraction of uranium from seawater — Utilization of Japan's plentiful seas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, with the advances made in the efficiency of seawater uranium extraction, a paper in the journal of ''Marine Science &amp; Engineering'' suggests that with, light water reactors as its target, the process would be [[economy of scale|economically competitive if implemented on a large scale]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/2/1/81 Development of a Kelp-Type Structure Module in a Coastal Ocean Model to Assess the Hydrodynamic Impact of Seawater Uranium Extraction Technology. Wang et. al. J. Mar. Sci. Eng. 2014, 2(1), 81-92; doi:10.3390/jmse2010081]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuclear power provides about 6% of the world's energy and 13–14% of the world's electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Nuclear Association]]. [http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=27665 Another drop in nuclear generation] ''World Nuclear News'', 5 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nuclear energy production is associated with potentially dangerous [[radioactive contamination]] as it relies upon unstable elements.  In particular, nuclear power facilities produce about 200,000 metric tons of [[low and intermediate level waste]] (LILW) and 10,000 metric tons of [[high level waste]] (HLW) (including spent fuel designated as waste) each year worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |title=Factsheets &amp; FAQs |publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) |accessdate=2012-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125062648/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Factsheets/English/manradwa.html |archivedate=25 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues entirely separate from the question of the sustainability of nuclear fuel, relate to the use of nuclear fuel and the high-level radioactive waste the nuclear industry generates that if not properly contained, is [[Acute radiation syndrome|highly hazardous]] to people and wildlife.   The United Nations ([[United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation|UNSCEAR]]) estimated in 2008 that average annual human radiation exposure includes 0.01 [[millisievert]] (mSv) from the legacy of past atmospheric nuclear testing plus the [[Chernobyl disaster]] and the nuclear fuel cycle, along with 2.0 mSv from natural radioisotopes and 0.4 mSv from [[cosmic ray]]s; all exposures [[Background radiation|vary by location]].&lt;ref name = UNSCEAR&gt;United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation.

[[Natural resource]]s, known as renewable resources, are replaced by [[Natural phenomenon|natural processes and forces]] persistent in the [[natural environment]]. There are [[Intermittent energy source|intermittent]] and reoccurring renewables, and [[Recycling|recyclable material]]s, which are utilized during a [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycle]] across a certain amount of time, and can be harnessed for any number of cycles.

The production of goods and services by [[manufacturing]] [[Product (business)|product]]s in [[economic system]]s creates many [[List of waste types|types of waste]] during production and after the [[consumer]] has made use of it. The material is then either [[Incineration|incinerated]], buried in a [[landfill]] or [[recycled]] for reuse.

The natural environment, with [[soil]], [[water]], [[forest]]s, [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are all renewable resources, as long as they are adequately [[Conservation biology|monitored, protected and conserved]]. [[Sustainable agriculture]] is the cultivation of plant and animal materials in a manner that preserves plant and animal [[ecosystem]]s over the long term. The [[overfishing]] of the oceans is one example of where an industry practice or method can threaten an ecosystem, endanger [[endangered species|species]] and possibly even determine whether or not a [[fishery]] is sustainable for use by humans. An unregulated industry practice or method can lead to a complete [[resource depletion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing In Small-Scale Marine and Inland Capture Fisharies|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/005/Y3274E/y3274e09.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ohotnikovo1.jpg|thumb|[[Okhotnykovo Solar Park]] is one of the world's [[List of photovoltaic power stations|largest photovoltaic power stations]].]] --&gt;

The renewable energy from the [[sun]], [[wind]], [[surface wave|wave]], [[biomass]] and [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal]] energies are based on renewable resources. Renewable resources such as the movement of [[water]] ([[hydropower]], [[tidal power]] and [[wave power]]), [[wind power|wind]] and [[radiant energy]] from geothermal heat (used for [[geothermal power]]) and solar energy (used for [[Solar energy|solar power]]) are practically infinite and cannot be depleted, unlike their non-renewable counterparts, which are likely to run out if not used sparingly.

The potential wave energy on coastlines can provide 1/5 of world demand. Hydroelectric power can supply 1/3 of our total energy global needs. Geothermal energy can provide 1.5 more times the energy we need. There is enough wind to power the planet 30 times over, wind power could power all of humanity's needs alone. Solar currently supplies only 0.1% of our world energy needs, but there is enough out there to power humanity's needs 4,000 times over, the entire global projected energy demand by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;R. Eisenberg and D. Nocera, "Preface: Overview of the Forum on Solar and Renewable Energy," Inorg. Chem. 44, 6799 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. V. Kamat, "Meeting the Clean Energy Demand: Nanostructure Architectures for Solar Energy Conversion," J. Phys. Chem. C 111, 2834 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy and [[Energy conservation|energy efficiency]] are no longer niche [[Economic sector|sector]]s that are promoted only by governments and environmentalists. The increasing levels of investment and that more of the capital is from conventional financial actors, both suggest that sustainable energy has become mainstream and the future of energy production, as non-renewable resources decline. This is reinforced by [[climate change]] concerns, nuclear dangers and accumulating radioactive waste, [[2000s energy crisis|high oil prices]], [[peak oil]] and increasing government support for renewable energy. These factors are [[renewable energy commercialization|commercializing renewable energy]], enlarging the market and growing demand, the adoption of new products to replace obsolete technology and the conversion of existing infrastructure to a renewable standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://energy-base.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/SEFI-Global-Trends-in-Sustainable-Energy-Investment-2007.pdf |title=Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2007: Analysis of Trends and Issues in the Financing of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in OECD and Developing Countries (PDF), p. 3. |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic models==
In economics, a non-renewable resource is defined as [[Good (economics)|goods]], where greater consumption today implies less consumption tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;Cremer and Salehi-Isfahani 1991:18&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ricardo]] in his early works analysed the pricing of exhaustible resources, where he argued that the price of a mineral resource should increase over time. He argued that the spot price is always determined by the mine with the highest cost of extraction, and mine owners with lower extraction costs benefit from a differential rent. The first model is defined by [[Hotelling's rule]], which is a 1931 economic model of non-renewable [[resource management]] by [[Harold Hotelling]]. It shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would, under otherwise stable conditions, lead to a [[resource depletion|depletion]] of the resource. The rule states that this would lead to a net price or "[[Hotelling rent]]" for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the [[rate of interest]], reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resources.
The [[Hartwick's rule]] provides an important result about the [[sustainability]] of welfare in an economy that uses non-renewable source.

'''Number Forms''' is a [[Unicode block]] containing characters that have specific meaning as [[number]]s, but are constructed from other characters.  They consist primarily of [[vulgar fraction]]s and [[Roman numerals]]. In addition to the characters in the Number Forms block, three fractions were inherited from [[ISO-8859-1]], which was incorporated whole as the [[Latin-1 Supplement (Unicode block)|Latin-1 supplement]] block.

'''Performativity''' is [[language]] which effects change in the world and functions as a form of social action.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Jillian R.|title=Performativity|journal=Anthropology|date=10 March 2015|doi=10.1093/OBO/9780199766567-0114|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0114.xml|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has multiple applications in diverse fields, such as [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[jurisprudence|law]], [[gender studies]], [[performance studies]], and [[economics]].

Performativity was first defined by [[philosopher of language]] [[J. L. Austin|John L. Austin]] as the capacity of speech and communication to act or to consummate an action. Common examples of performative language are making promises, betting, performing a wedding ceremony, an umpire calling a strike, or a judge pronouncing a verdict. Austin differentiated this from constative language, which he defined as descriptive language that can be "evaluated as true or false".&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt;

Influenced by Austin, philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]] argued that [[social construction of gender|gender is socially constructed]] through commonplace [[speech act]]s and [[nonverbal communication]] that are performative, in that they serve to define and maintain [[social identity|identities]].&lt;ref name="Butler1990"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Gender Trouble|year=1990|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of performativity reverses the idea that a person's identity is the source of their secondary actions (speech, gestures). Instead, it views actions, behaviors and gestures as both the result of an individual's identity as well as a source that contributes to the formation of one's identity which is continuously being redefined through speech acts and symbolic communication.&lt;ref name=Cavanaugh/&gt; This view was also influenced by philosophers such as [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Studies and Discourse Analysis – Barker &amp; Galasinski&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===J. L. Austin===

The term derives from the founding work in [[speech act]] theory by ordinary language philosopher [[J. L. Austin]], who did not use the word "performativity", but did, beginning in the 1950s, give the name [[performative utterances]] to situations where saying something was doing something, rather than simply reporting on or describing reality. The paradigmatic case here is speaking the words "I do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=J L|title=How To Do Things With Words|year=1962|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking with [[analytic philosophy]], Austin argued in ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]'' that a "performative utterance" cannot be said to be either true or false, as a constative utterance might be. It can only be judged either "happy" or "infelicitous", depending upon whether the conditions required for its success have been met. In this sense, performativity is a function of the [[pragmatics]] of language. Having shown that ''all'' utterances perform actions, even apparently constative ones, Austin famously discarded the distinction between "performative" and "constative" utterances halfway through the lecture series that became the book and replaced it with a three-level framework:

* ''locution'' (the actual words spoken, that which the linguists and linguistic philosophers of the day were mostly interested in analyzing) 
* ''illocutionary force'' (what the speaker is attempting to do ''in'' uttering the locution) 
* ''perlocutionary effect'' (the actual effect the speaker actually has on the interlocutor ''by'' uttering the locution)

For example, if a speech act is an attempt to distract someone, the illocutionary force is the attempt to distract and the perlocutionary effect is the actual distraction caused by the speech act in the interlocutor.

Austin's account of performativity has been subject to extensive discussion in philosophy, literature, and beyond. [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Shoshana Felman]], [[Judith Butler]], and [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] are among the scholars who have elaborated upon and contested aspects of Austin's account from the vantage point of [[deconstruction]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[feminism]], and [[queer theory]]. Particularly in the work of feminists and queer theorists, performativity has played an important role in discussions of [[social change]] (Oliver 2003).

The concept of performativity has also been used in [[science and technology studies]] and in [[economic sociology]]. [[Andrew Pickering]] has proposed to shift from a "representational idiom" to a "performative idiom" in the study of science. [[Michel Callon]] has proposed to study the performative aspects of [[economics]], i.e. the extent to which economic science plays an important role not only in describing markets and economies, but also in framing them. Karen Barad has argued that science and technology studies deemphasize the performativity of language in order to explore the performativity of matter (Barad 2003).

Other uses of the notion of performativity in the social sciences include the daily behavior (or performance) of individuals based on social norms or habits. Philosopher and feminist theorist [[Judith Butler]] has used the concept of performativity in her analysis of [[gender]] development, as well as in her analysis of political speech. [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]] describes [[Queer theory|queer]] performativity as an ongoing project for transforming the way we may define—and break—boundaries to identity. Through her suggestion that shame is a potentially performative and transformational emotion, Sedgwick has also linked queer performativity to [[affect theory]]. Also innovative in Sedgwick's discussion of the performative is what she calls ''periperformativity'' (2003: 67–91), which is effectively the group contribution to the success or failure of a speech act.

===John Searle's reformulation===
In ''[[A Taxonomy of Illocutionary Acts]]'', [[John Searle]] takes up and reformulates the ideas of his colleague [[J. L. Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Searle largely supports and agrees with Austin’s theory of speech acts, he has a number of critiques, which he outlines: “In sum, there are (at least) six related difficulties with Austin’s taxonomy; in ascending order of importance: there is a persistent confusion between verbs and acts, not all the verbs are illocutionary verbs, there is too much overlap of the categories, too much heterogeneity within the categories, many of the verbs listed in the categories don't satisfy the definition given for the category and, most important, there is no consistent principle of classification.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His last key departure from Austin lies in Searle’s claim that four of his universal ‘acts’ do not need ‘extra-linguistic’ contexts to succeed.&lt;ref name="John1979"&gt;{{cite book|title=Expression and meaning : studies in the theory of speech acts|year=1979|publisher=Cambridge University Press|last = Searle|first = John|authorlink=John Searle|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to Austin who thinks all illocutionary acts need extra-linguistic institutions, Searle disregards the necessity of context and replaces it with the “rules of language.”&lt;ref name="John1979" /&gt;

=== Jacques Derrida ===
Philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] drew on Austin's theory of performative speech act while deconstructing its logocentric and phonocentric premises and reinscribing it within the operations of generalized writing. In contrast to structuralism's focus on linguistic form, Austin had introduced the ''force'' of speech acts, which Derrida aligns with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche's]] insights on language. 

In "Signature, Event, Context," Derrida focused on Austin's privileging of speech and the accompanying presumptions of the presence of a speaker ("signature") and the bounding of a performative's force by an act or a context. In a passage that would become a touchstone of poststructuralist thought, Derrida stresses the citationality or iterability of any and all signs.&lt;blockquote&gt;Every sign, linguistic or nonlinguistic, spoken or written (in the current sense of this opposition), in a small or large unit, can be ''cited'', put between quotation marks; in doing so it can break with every given context, engendering an infinity of new contexts in a manner which is absolutely illimitable. This does not imply that the mark is valid outside of a context, but on the contrary that there are only contexts without any center or absolute anchorage [''ancrage'']. This citationality, this duplication or duplicity, this iterability of the mark is neither an accident nor an anomaly, it is that (normal/abnormal) without which a mark could not even have a function called "normal." What would a mark be that could not be cited? Or one whose origins would not get lost along the way?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Limited, Inc.|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=Northwestern University Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0810107885|location=Evanston|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Derrida's stress on the citational dimension of performativity would be taken up by Judith Butler and other theorists. While he addressed the performativity of individual subject formation, Derrida also raised such questions as whether we can mark when the event of the Russian revolution went awry, thus scaling up the field of performativity to historical dimensions. 

=== Judith Butler ===
{{Main|Gender performativity}}

Philosopher and [[feminist]] theorist [[Judith Butler]] offered a new, more [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] (specifically, [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]]) reading of the notion of performativity, which has its roots in [[linguistics]] and [[philosophy of language]]. She describes performativity as “that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bodies that Matter:  On the Discursive Limits of "Sex"|last = Butler|first = Judith|publisher = Routledge|year = 1993|isbn = 9780415903660|location = New York|pages = xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has largely used this concept in her analysis of [[gender]] development.&lt;ref&gt;This idea was first introduced in 1988 in an issue of ''[[Theatre Journal]]'' (Brickell, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept places emphasis on the manners by which identity is passed or brought to life through discourse.  Performative acts are types of authoritative speech. This can only happen and be enforced through the law or norms of the society. These statements, just by speaking them, carry out a certain action and exhibit a certain level of power. Examples of these types of statements are declarations of ownership, baptisms, inaugurations, and legal sentences. Something that is key to performativity is repetition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|title=An audio overview of queer theory in English and Turkish by Jack Halberstam|url=https://archive.org/details/HalberstamQueerTheory-AnkaraTurkey|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=2014-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statements are not singular in nature or use and must be used consistently in order to exert power (Hall 2000).

==== Performance theory and gender perspectives ====

Butler sees gender as an act that has been rehearsed, much like a script, and that people, as actors who make a script a reality through repetition, come to perform in the mode of belief. “For Butler, the distinction between the personal and the political or between private and public is itself a fiction designed to support an oppressive status quo: our most personal acts are, in fact, continually being scripted by hegemonic social conventions and ideologies” (Felluga, 2006).  Butler sees gender not as an expression of what one is, rather as something that one does.  Furthermore, she sees it not as a social imposition on a gender neutral body, but rather as a mode of "self-making" through which subjects become socially intelligible.  According to Butler’s theory, homosexuality and heterosexuality are not fixed categories.  A person is merely in a condition of “doing straightness” or “doing queerness” (Lloyd, 1999).

==== Theoretical criticisms ====

There are several criticisms that have been raised against Butler's concept of performativity.  The first is that the theory is individual in nature and does not take other factors into consideration.  These factors include the space within which the performance occurs, the others involved and how they might see or interpret what they witness.  Also, the unplanned effects of the performance act are overlooked and the contingencies are not taken into consideration. (Lloyd, 1999)

Another criticism is that Butler is not clear about the concept of subject.  It has been said that in her writings, sometimes the subject only exists tentatively, sometimes they possess a “real” existence and other times are socially active.  Also, some observe that the theory might be better suited to literary analysis as opposed to social theory. (Brickell, 2005)

Others criticize Butler for taking [[Ethnomethodology|ethnomethodological]] and [[Symbolic interactionism|symbolic interactionist]] sociological analyses of gender and merely reinventing them in the concept of performativity (Dunn 1997; Green 2007).  For example, Green (2007) argues that the work of [[Sue Kessler|Kessler]] and [[Wendy McKenna|McKenna]] (1978) and West and Zimmerman (1987) builds directly from [[Harold Garfinkel|Garfinkel]] (1967) and [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] (1959) to deconstruct gender into moments of attribution and iteration in a continual social process of "doing" [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] in the [[performative interval]].  These latter works are premised on the notion that gender does not precede but, rather, follows from practice, instantiated in micro-interaction. Butler downgrades gender's constructed nature to fight for oppressed identities.

=== Jean-François Lyotard ===
In ''[[The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979, English translation 1986), philosopher and cultural theorist [[Jean-François Lyotard]] defined performativity as the defining mode of [[legitimation]] of postmodern knowledge and social bonds, that is, power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge.|last=Lyotard|first=Jean-Francois|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1986|isbn=978-0816611737|location=Minneapolis|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the legitimation of modern knowledge through such grand narratives as Progress, Revolution, and Liberation, performativity operates by system optimization or the calculation of input and outputs. In a footnote, Lyotard aligns performativity with Austin's concept of performative speech act. Postmodern knowledge must not only report: it must do something and do it efficiently by maximizing input/output ratios.

Lyotard uses [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Wittgenstein's]] notion of language games to theorize how performativity governs the articulation, funding, and conduct of contemporary research and education, arguing that at bottom it involves the threat of terror: "be operational (that is commensurable) or disappear" (xxiv). While Lyotard is highly critical of performativity, he notes that it calls on researchers to explain not only the worth of their work but also the worth of that worth. 

Lyotard associated performativity with the rise of digital computers in the post-World War II period. In ''Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945,'' historian [[Tony Judt]] cites Lyotard to argue that the Left has largely abandoned revolutionary politics for human rights advocacy. The widespread adoption of performance reviews, organizational assessments, and learning outcomes by different social institutions worldwide has led social researchers to theorize "audit culture" and "global performativity." 

Against performativity and [[Jürgen Habermas|Jurgen Habermas]]' call for consensus, Lyotard argued for legitimation by ''paralogy'', or the destabilizing, often paradoxical, introduction of difference into language games.

==Other applications==

===Video art===

Theories of performativity have extended across multiple disciplines and discussions. Notably, interdisciplinary theorist [[José Esteban Muñoz]] has related video to theories of performativity. Specifically, Muñoz looks at the 1996 documentary by Susana Aiken and Carlos Aparicio, "The Transformation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|author = Muñoz|authorlink = José Esteban Muñoz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although historically and theoretically related to performance art, [[video art]] is not an immediate performance; it is mediated, iterative and citational. In this way, video art raises questions of performativity. Additionally, video art frequently puts bodies and display, complicating borders, surfaces, embodiment, and boundaries and so indexing performativity.

=== Finance and economics ===
In economics, the “performativity thesis” is the claim that the assumptions and models used by professionals and popularizers affect the phenomena they purport to describe; bringing the world more into line with theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://kieranhealy.org/files/drafts/performativity.pdf|title = The Performativity of Networks|last = Healy|first = Kieran|date = 2015|journal = European Journal of Sociology|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="doing"&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing Economics|date=2010|publisher=The Open University|location=Milton Keynes|isbn=978 1 8487 34692|page=493}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is debated in ''Do Economists Make Markets'' edited by [[Donald Angus MacKenzie]], Fabian Muniesa and Lucia Siu, and in ''Enacting Dismal Science'' edited by Ivan Boldyrev and Ekaterina Svetlova. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8442.html | title=Do Economists Make Markets?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.palgrave.com/de/book/9781137492104# | title=Enacting Dismal Science - New Perspectives on the Performativity of Economics &amp;#124; Ivan Boldyrev &amp;#124; Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journalism ===

The German news anchorman [[Hanns Joachim Friedrichs]] once argued that a good journalist should never act in collusion with anything, not even with a good thing. In the evening of November 9, 1989, the evening of the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], however, Friedrichs reportedly broke his own rule when he announced: "The gates of the wall are wide open." („Die Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen.“) In reality, the gates were still closed. According to a historian, it was this announcement that encouraged thousands of East Berliners to march towards the wall, finally forcing the border guards to open the gates. In the sense of performativity, Friedrichs's words became a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/mauerfall/der-schoenste-fehler-in-40-jahren-tagesthemen-54357108.bild.html | title=Zum Jubiläum - der schönste Fehler in 40 Jahren "Tagesthemen"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/30/AR2009103001846.html | title=Mary Elise Sarotte -- How an accident caused the Berlin Wall to come down| date=November 2009| last1=Sarotte| first1=Mary Elise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7603">'''Planetary management''' is intentional global-scale management of [[Earth]]'s [[biological]], [[chemical]] and [[physical property|physical]] processes and [[Biogeochemical cycle|cycles]] ([[Water cycle|water]], [[Carbon cycle re-balancing|carbon]], [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]], [[Sulfur cycle|sulfur]], [[Phosphorus cycle|phosphorus]], and others). Planetary management also includes managing [[human]]ity’s influence on planetary-scale processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6743/full/400399a0.html|title=A manual for planetary management|accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Effective planetary management aims to prevent destabilisation of [[Earth's climate]], protect [[biodiversity]] and maintain or improve human well-being. More specifically, it aims to benefit society and the [[World economy|global economy]], and safeguard the [[ecosystem services]] upon which humanity depends – global [[climate]], [[freshwater]] supply, [[food]], [[energy]], clean air, fertile [[soil]], [[pollinators]], and so on.

Because of the sheer complexity and enormous scope of the task, it remains to be seen whether planetary management is a feasible paradigm for maintaining global [[sustainability]].  The concept currently has defenders and critics on both sides: [[environmentalist]] [[David W. Orr]] questions whether such a task can be accomplished with human help and technology or without first examining the underlying human causes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Orr |first=David W. |authorlink=David W.

The term has been around in science fiction novels since the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In 2004, the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] published “Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt; The publication’s executive summary concluded: “An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required”. It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment. In 2009, the [[planetary boundaries]] concept was published in the science journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]. The paper identifies nine boundaries in the Earth system. Remaining within these nine boundaries, the authors suggest, may safeguard the current equilibrium.

In 2007, France called for [[UNEP]] to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization, the [[United Nations Environment Organization]]. The rationale was that UNEP’s status as a programme, rather than an organization in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of Earth. The call was backed by 46 countries. Notably, the top five emitters of [[greenhouse gas]]es failed to support the call.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL03357553._CH_.2400 |title=46 nations call for tougher U.N. environment role|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=2007-02-03|first=Alister|last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with other environmental worldviews ==
Together with planetary management, [[stewardship]] and [[environmental wisdom]] are different ways to manage the Earth&lt;ref name=cosm&gt;[http://www.brighthub.com/environment/green-living/articles/11650.aspx Donna Cosmato, ''What's Your Environmental Worldview?'']&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[environmental worldview]]s".

In particular:
* Planetary management focus its attention on humans needs and wants, while stewardship aim at the benefit of humans, organisms and ecosystems of the Earth:&lt;ref name=cosm/&gt; in other words, planetary management considers humans as the most important species in the Earth, while stewardship and environmental wisdom consider all the species at the same level of importance.
* To accomplish its scope, planetary management relies on technology and innovation (as stewardship and [[spaceship-earth worldview]]), while environmental wisdom relies on the lesson learned from nature.&lt;ref name=cosm/&gt;

{{Psychology sidebar}}

The '''Positive and Negative Affect Schedule''' ('''PANAS''') is a self-report questionnaire that consists of two 10-item scales to measure both [[Positive affectivity|positive]] and [[Negative affectivity|negative affect]]. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale of 1 ''(not at all)'' to 5 ''(very much)''. The measure has been used mainly as a research tool in group studies, but can be utilized within clinical and non-clinical populations as well.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crawford|first=John R.|last2=Henry|first2=Julie D.|title=The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS): Construct validity, measurement properties and normative data in a large non-clinical sample|url=http://doi.crossref.org/10.1348/0144665031752934|journal=British Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=43|issue=3|pages=245–265|doi=10.1348/0144665031752934}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortened, elongated, and children's versions of the PANAS have been developed, taking approximately 5–10 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Clinical and non-clinical studies have found the PANAS to be a reliable and valid instrument in the assessment of positive and negative affect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=David|last2=Clark|first2=Lee A.|last3=Tellegen|first3=Auke|title=Development and validation of brief measures of positive and negative affect: The PANAS scales.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=54|issue=6|pages=1063–1070|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.54.6.1063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and history ==
The PANAS was developed in 1988 by researchers from the University of Minnesota and Southern Methodist University. Previous mood measures have shown correlations of variable strength between positive and negative affect, and these same measures have questionable reliability and validity. Watson, Clark, and Tellegen developed the PANAS in an attempt to provide a better, purer measure of each of these dimensions.

The researchers extracted 60 terms from the factor analyses of Michael Zevon and Tellegen&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zevon|first=Michael A.|last2=Tellegen|first2=Auke|date=1982-07-01|title=The structure of mood change: An idiographic/nomothetic analysis.|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/43/1/111|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=English|volume=43|issue=1|pages=111–122|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.1.111|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown to be relatively accurate markers of either positive or negative affect, but not both. They chose terms that met a strong correlation to one corresponding dimension but exhibited a weak correlation to the other. Through multiple rounds of elimination and preliminary analyses with a test population, the researchers arrived at 10 terms for each of the two scales, as follows:

== Versions ==

===PANAS-C===
The '''PANAS for Children (PANAS-C)''' was developed in an attempt to differentiate the affective expressions of anxiety and depression in children. The tripartite model on which this measure is based suggests that high levels of negative affect is present in those with anxiety and depression, but high levels of positive affect is not shared between the two. Previous mood scales for children have been shown to reliably capture the former relationship but not the latter; the PANAS-C was created as a tool with better discriminant validity for child assessment. Similar to the development of the original PANAS, the PANAS-C drew from terms of the PANAS-X and eliminated several terms with insufficient correlations between the term and the affective construct after preliminary analyses with a non-clinical sample of children. The final version of the measure consists of 27 items: 12 positive affect terms and 15 negative affect terms. Despite the purpose of its development, however, the measure’s discriminant validity is still wanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Alicia A.|last2=Kendall|first2=Philip C.|date=2009-01-14|title=Psychometric Properties of the Positive and Negative Affect Scale for Children (PANAS-C) in Children with Anxiety Disorders|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10578-009-0130-4|journal=Child Psychiatry and Human Development|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=343–352|doi=10.1007/s10578-009-0130-4|issn=0009-398X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PANAS-SF===
The '''PANAS-SF''',  comprises 10 items that were determined through the highest factor loadings on the exploratory [[factor analysis]] reported by Watson et al. (1988) in his original PANAS. Previous mood scales, such that of Bradburn, had low reliabilities and high correlations between subscales. Watson was able to address these concerns in his study of the original PANAS; however, his participants consisted mostly of student populations. The purpose of the PANAS-SF was not only to provide a shorter and more concise form of the PANAS, but to be able to apply the schedules to older clinical populations. Overall, it was reported that this modified model was consistent with Watson’s.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kercher|first=Kyle|date=1992-06-01|title=Assessing Subjective Well-Being in the Old-Old The PANAS as a Measure of Orthogonal Dimensions of Positive and Negative Affect|url=http://roa.sagepub.com/content/14/2/131|journal=Research on Aging|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=131–168|doi=10.1177/0164027592142001|issn=0164-0275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===I-PANAS-SF===
Separate from the PANAS-SF,  Edmund Thompson created the international PANAS short form ('''I-PANAS-SF''') in order to make a 10 item mood scale that can be implemented effectively on an international level, provide more clarity on the content of the items, reduce ambiguities, address the limitations of the original and the previous short form of the PANAS, and also to provide a shorter, yet dependable and valid scale. To determine the 10 items of the 20 original items, two focus groups were utilized to evaluate all of the original 20 PANAS items. They found that while some items were easily understood by the participant, certains items had different meanings or were too ambiguous. Items that had too much ambiguity were eliminated from the modified form. Researchers found that the I-PANAS-SF had high correlations with the original PANAS. Through multiple tests and studies, they were able to determine that the I-PANAS-SF was on par with the original scale and can be used as a reliable, valid, brief, and efficient instrument on an international scale.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Edmund R.|date=2007-03-01|title=Development and Validation of an Internationally Reliable Short-Form of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)|url=http://jcc.sagepub.com/content/38/2/227|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=227–242|doi=10.1177/0022022106297301|issn=0022-0221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PANAS-X===
In 1994, Watson and Clark developed an expanded form of the PANAS, called the '''PANAS-X''', that consists of 60 items that can be completed in 10 minutes or less. The PANAS-X incorporates the original, higher order dimensions specified in the PANAS in addition to the measures of 11 lower order emotional states. These measures are broken down into three main categories: basic negative emotion scales consisting of fear, hostility, guilt, and sadness; basic positive emotion scales consisting of joviality, self-assurance, and attentiveness; and other affective states consisting of shyness, fatigue, serenity, and surprise. Through extensive analyses, all eleven affective states, with the exception of surprise, were shown to be stable, valid measures that assess how an individual’s emotional states fluctuate over time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=Watson,|last2=Anna|first2=Clark, Lee|date=1999-01-01|title=The PANAS-X: Manual for the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Expanded Form|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/psychology_pubs/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Many forms of the PANAS (PANAS-C, PANAS-X, I-PANAS-SF, and among others) have shown that the PANAS has been widely employed. Recent studies have also shown that the PANAS can be administered in a large general adult population, as well as other populations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, to date, the PANAS is mostly used as a research tool in group studies, but it has the potential to be utilized in clinical work with individuals.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Furthermore, the PANAS has the potential to be used to evaluate mental illnesses, as shown in an experiment conducted by Dyck, Jolly, and Kramer, which demonstrated its effectiveness in distinguishing between depression and anxiety in clinical samples.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

== Limitations ==
Since the PANAS is a self-report questionnaire, it can be difficult to assess people’s mood accurately, as people can overstate or understate their experience of their moods. In addition, the original PANAS had a limited sample size of college students, which concerns with wide applicability to other samples. Furthermore, some studies claim that the PANAS is too long or that its items are redundant.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The PANAS does not encompass higher order mood states.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The definition of [[propaganda]] is most commonly defined as "information", especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/propaganda|title=propaganda - definition of propaganda in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the deliberate sharing of realities, views, and philosophies intended to alter behavior and stimulate people to act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hobbes|first=Renee|date=|title=Teaching about Propaganda: An Examination of the Historical Roots of Media Literacy|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1046525.pdf|journal=Journal of Media Literacy Education|volume=6|pages=57|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To explain the close associations between media and propaganda, Richard Alan Nelson observed propaganda as a form of [[persuasion]] with intention with the aid of controlled transmission of single-sided information through [[mass media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of Public Diplomacy|last=Snow|first=Nancy|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass media and propaganda are inseparable.

Mass media as a system for spreading and disseminating information and messages to public plays a role in amusing, entertaining and informing individuals with rules and values that situate them in social structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chomsky.info/consent01/|title=A Propaganda Model, by Noam Chomsky (Excerpted from Manufacturing Consent)|website=chomsky.info|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, propaganda is a necessity for creating conflicts between different classes in society. In a media-saturated modern society, mass media is the main channel for the carrying out the propaganda action and fulfill the propaganda practices.

Modern propaganda includes using a variety of media in order to spread messages. This could include using press, radio, television, film, computers, fax machines, posters, meetings, door-to-door canvassing, handbills, buttons, billboards, speeches, flags, street names, monuments, coins, stamps, books, plays, comic strips, poetry, music, sporting events, cultural events, company reports, libraries, and awards and prizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/war_peace/media/hpropaganda.html|title=Media's Use of Propaganda to Persuade People's Attitude, Beliefs and Behaviors|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:30b Sammlung Eybl USA James Montgomery Flagg (1877-1960) I want you for U.S. Army. 1917. 101 x 76 cm. (Coll..Nr. 3116).jpg|left|thumb|147x147px|Military recruiting poster of US during wartimes.]]
"Propaganda" was a term that was commonly used in 1914, the beginning of the World War,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/what-is-propaganda/the-story-of-propaga)|title=What Is Propaganda? {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; though its origin can be traced back to the ancient Greece. In Athens, the original place of civilization as well as the centre of humankind culture, the citizen class was conscious and well informed of their interests and public affairs. Thus, conflicts and divergence on individual interests and other religious matters demands propaganda. Without the modern mass media such as newspaper, radio and televisions functioning as a medium for information spreading, a series of alternatives can play a role for propagandizing values and beliefs to shape and mould the opinions of men. These can include dramas, games and religious festivals. Additionally, another tool for propaganda in an oral-biased society is articulation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/about-aha-and-membership/aha-history-and-archives/gi-roundtable-series/pamphlets/what-is-propaganda/the-story-of-propaganda|title=The Story of Propaganda {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Propaganda today is endowed with negative connotative meanings in a political context, despite that the word entered language with religious origins. Pope Gregory XV established an institution for spreading the faith and addressing a series of church affairs, which is namely the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. Further, a College of Propaganda was set up under Pope Urban VIII to train priests for missions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:STOP THIS MONSTER THAT STOPS AT NOTHING. PRODUCE TO THE LIMIT. THIS IS YOUR WAR. - NARA - 513557.jpg|thumb|Nazi propaganda poster.]]
Throughout the historical stages, propaganda has always been evident in momentum social movements such as American independence, the French Revolution,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and especially during wartimes. Wartime propaganda is often demanded for shaping public opinions to gain more allies on an international level, as well as calling for citizens to make a contribution and sacrifice to the war on a domestic level. Governments during the First World War devoted massive resources and huge amounts of effort to producing material designed to shape opinion and action internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/world-war-one/articles/propaganda-as-a-weapon|title=Propaganda as a weapon? Influencing international opinion|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Clark claimed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-studies.ca/articles/war_propaganda.htm|title=Propaganda and War|website=www.media-studies.ca|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; posters in wartime with some visual codes are powerful tools to make people adapt to the new conditions and norms arising from the wars and to accommodate the needs of the war. During the Second World War, the power of propaganda came to the extreme, under the horrors of Nazi Germany. And since then, the word carries more negative connotations than neutral.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.tavbooks.com/?p=755|title=A Brief History of Propaganda|date=2014-02-20|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, the term is used in journalism, advertising, and education mostly in a political context. In non-democratic countries, propaganda continues to flourish as a means for indoctrinating citizens, and this practice is unlikely to cease in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In its origins, "propaganda" is an ancient and honorable word.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Propaganda on social media ==
[[Social media]] become a powerful tool for propaganda as the Internet is unprecedentedly accessible for each individual, and interactive social networking sites provide a strong platform for debate and sharing opinions. Propaganda, in forms of a video uploaded to YouTube, a post on Facebook or Twitter, or even a piece of comment, has far-reaching effectiveness to disseminate certain values and beliefs.

Another element that makes social media effective for sharing propaganda is that it can reach many people with little effort and users can filter the content to remove content they do not want while retaining what they would like to see.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marketplace.org/2017/10/23/tech/how-social-media-brought-political-propoganda-21st-century|title=How social media brought political propaganda into the 21st century|last=Wood|first=Molly|last2=Schwab|first2=Kristin|date=October 23, 2017|website=MarketPlace|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ease of use can be used by ordinary people as well as government agencies and politicians, who can take advantage of the platforms to spread [[fake news website|"junk" news]] in favor of their cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2018-07-social-media-globally.html|title=Social media manipulation rising globally, new report warns|last=University of Oxford|first=|date=July 20, 2018|website=Phys.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Youtube Propaganda ===
As it is reported in New York Times,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  "A propaganda video is released by North Korea on YouTube mainly depicting a United States aircraft carrier and a warplane being destroyed in computer-generated balls of fire, the latest salvo in an escalating war of words between the two. The video released by a state media outlet is narrated by a woman and including images of North Korea’s military. According to the video, North Korea’s missiles will be "stabbed into the throat of the carrier," and the jet will "fall from the sky," it warns."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/world/asia/north-korea-propaganda-video-attack-us.html|title=North Korea Flexes Its Military Muscle on YouTube, With Added Effects|last=Goldman|first=Russell|date=2017-03-21|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-19|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards of the event of Westminster terrorism attacking, YouTube is also an important tool for ISIS terrorism propaganda. ISIS flooded YouTube with hundreds of violent recruitment videos with terrifying visual or audio effects to promote and awake Westminster terror attack to capitalise on the atrocity. As ''The Sun'' reported, "many of the videos glorify terrorist Khalid Masood while others feature beheadings and extreme violence carried out by children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3185533/isis-floods-youtube-with-sick-propaganda-praising-westminster-terror-attacker/|title=ISIS floods YouTube with sick propaganda praising Westminster terror attacker|date=2017-03-27|work=The Sun|access-date=2017-04-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Twitter propaganda ===

==== The Computational Propaganda Research Project ====
In 2017 the University of Oxford announced the launch of a series of studies researching how social media is globally used to manipulate public opinion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The study, which used interviews and "tens of millions posts on seven different social media platforms during scores of elections, political crises, and national security incidents", found that in Russia, approximately 45% of Twitter accounts are bots and in Taiwan, a campaign against [[Tsai Ing-wen|President Tsai Ing-wen]] involved thousands of accounts being heavily coordinated and sharing Chinese propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://comprop.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/working-papers/computational-propaganda-worldwide-executive-summary/|title=Computational Propaganda Worldwide: Executive Summary|work=The Computational Propaganda Project|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques to like, share, and post on social networks were used. The bot accounts were used to "game algorithms" to push different content on the platforms. Real content put out by real people can be covered up and bots can make online measures of support, such as the number of likes or retweets something has received, look larger than it should, thus tricking users into thinking that specific piece of content is popular, a process identified as manufacturing consensus.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/19/social-media-proganda-manipulating-public-opinion-bots-accounts-facebook-twitter|title=Facebook and Twitter are being used to manipulate public opinion – report|last=Hern|first=Alex|date=2017-06-19|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Russian Propaganda on Twitter ====
During the 2016 presidential election, 200,000 tweets deemed as "malicious activity" from Russia-linked accounts were outed on Twitter. The accounts pushed hundreds of thousands of these tweets claiming that Democrats were practicing witchcraft and posed as [[Black Lives Matter]] activists. Investigators were able to trace the account to a Kremlin-linked propaganda outfit. It was founded in 2013 and known as the [[Internet Research Agency]] (IRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/now-available-more-200-000-deleted-russian-troll-tweets-n844731|title=Twitter deleted Russian troll tweets.

"Using little-known content uploading services, anonymous text-pasting sites and multiple backup Twitter accounts, a select group of ISIS operatives managed to evade administrators’ controls to spread the Cantlie video, titled Lend Me Your Ears, around the web within a few hours."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/24/isis-twitter-youtube-message-social-media-jihadi|title=Isis in duel with Twitter and YouTube to spread extremist propaganda|last=Malik|first=Shiv|date=2014-09-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-04-19|last2=Laville|first2=Sandra|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|last3=Cresci|first3=Elena|last4=Gani|first4=Aisha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example of propaganda, Abdulrahman, the operator al-Hamid used the techniques of hashtagging in a Twitter post to gain the heat of the topics to disseminate the information. A great deal of followers of Hamid on Twitter were demanded to find the highest trending topics in the UK and popular account names they could jump on to get the largest possible reach. As @Abu_Laila wrote: "We need those who can supply us with the most active hashtags in the UK. And also the accounts of the most famous celebrities. I believe that the hashtag of Scotland's separation from Britain should be the first."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Propaganda on Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has made huge impact on society by allowing thousands of people to communicate with their family and friends, and be able to keep up-to-date with the rest of the world. But the usage of Facebook leads to the activity of propaganda online. For example, the Facebook pages of Syrian [[Bashar al-Assad|President Bashar al-Assad]] and the National Coalition of Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces in 2013 and 2014, uses images to promote their agendas relating to politics during the conflicts following 2011 uprisings in Syria.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seo|first=Hyunjin|last2=Ebrahim|first2=Husain|date=2016-12-01|title=Visual propaganda on Facebook: A comparative analysis of Syrian conflicts|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1750635216661648|journal=Media, War &amp; Conflict|language=en|volume=9|issue=3|pages=227–251|doi=10.1177/1750635216661648|issn=1750-6352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their government uses visual frames to help support the image that President Assad is a "fearless leader protecting its people and that life has continued normally through Syria," and to help strengthen the images of the violence and sufferings of the civilians caused by the Assad regime.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

There is also research that "cloaked" Facebook accounts are behind the creation of spreading political propaganda online to "imitate the identity of an opponent so they can spark hateful and aggressive reactions" from the media and the opponent.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farkas|first=Johan|last2=Schou|first2=Jannick|last3=Neumayer|first3=Christina|date=2018-05-01|title=Cloaked Facebook pages: Exploring fake Islamist propaganda in social media|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444817707759|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=20|issue=5|pages=1850–1867|doi=10.1177/1461444817707759|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process goes after a case study on a Danish Facebook pages that are cloaking their pages to resemble radical Islamist pages to help "[provoke} racist and anti-Muslim reactions as well as negative sentiments towards refugees and immigrants in Denmark."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The research founded on the pages analyzes the challenges of propaganda online, such as epistemological, methodological and conceptual challenges. The information also adds to the reader's "understanding of disinformation and propaganda in an increasingly interactive social media environment and contributes to a critical inquiry into social media and subversive politics."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Propaganda in Music ==
Music has always played a major role in popular culture.  Political ideology is often spread through media; however, the use of music reaches an extremely wide and varying audience.  The point of propaganda, according to Manzaria and Bruck, is to “Persuade people’s attitude, beliefs, and behaviors”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/war_peace/media/hpropaganda.html|title=Media's Use of Propaganda to Persuade People's|last1=Manzaria|first1=Johnie|last2=Bruck|first2=Jonathon|website=EDGE ethics od development in a global environment|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Music of all genres is constantly being used to portray a [[Music and politics|political view]], shed light, or bring validity to a subject the author, or artist, feels is worth venturing.  Propaganda through modes like advertisement and campaign, while effective, will only reach a small group of the desired recipients. 

According to Putman, musical propaganda has a great deal to do with the audience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article-abstract/30/4/361/200108?redirectedFrom=PDF|title=The Aesthetic Relation of Musical Performance and Audience|last1=Putman|first1=Daniel|website=Oxford Academic|publisher=British Journal of Aesthetics|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each musical genre can reach a specific demographic within a few minutes, along with the propaganda intertwined. Purfleau brings a more social view to the concept of politically motivated music, stating that musical propaganda is "the basis for a certain kind of political art that aspires to contest the contemporary economic and social order"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/ca/7523862.0012.007/--reflections-on-music-and-propaganda?keywords=rgn...;rgn=main;view=fulltext|title=Reflections on Music and Propaganda|last1=Pufleau|first1=Luis|website=Contemporary Aesthetics|publisher=Michigan Publishing|accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Purfleau's approach to understanding musical propaganda explains the timeless manor by which music has been used to portray viewpoints. Though music is not always the first media thought of when contemplating propaganda, it is an extremely effective mode and has proved to influence popular culture throughout human history.

'''Return on modeling effort''' ('''ROME''') is the benefit resulting from a (supplementary) effort to improve a model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://erikproper.blogspot.fr/2009/02/models-that-matter-return-on-modelling.html|title=Models that matter; Return on Modelling Effort|website=erikproper.blogspot.fr|last=Proper|first=Erik|year=2009|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
In engineering, [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] always serves a particular goal. For example, the lightning protection of aircraft can be modeled as an electrical circuit, in order to predict whether the protection will still work in 30 years, given the ageing of its electrical components. More and more effort can be put in making this model predict reality perfectly. However, this perfection comes at a price: researchers invest time and money in improving the model. As a [[Return on investment]] (ROI), the ROME is a metric for the use of further modeling. It may therefore serve as a 'stopping criterion'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Typically, researchers will pull towards continuing modeling, while management will pull towards stopping modeling. Being explicit about the cost and benefits of continued modeling may help to make informed decisions that are understood by both sides.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Domains ==
ROME is a [[:Category:metrics|metric]], which can be evaluated wherever modeling is performed with a business goal. Examples include:
* Modeling a marketing mix to statistically correlate a number of inputs (or independent variables) - such as a marketing campaign - to outcomes (or dependent variables) - such as sales or profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.decisionanalyst.com/whitepapers/marketingmixmodeling/|title=Marketing Mix Modeling|last=Thomas|first=Jerry W.|year=2006|access-date=2016-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modeling the links between enterprise actors to make an informed choice on splitting organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:139c7255-226c-49c0-a6e8-31eebf49d3b7|title=Instrument for fast and effective splitting of organizations|last=Op 't Land|first=Martin|publisher=TU Delft|year=2008|isbn=978-90-71382-37-6|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:0edd0472-39df-4296-b692-e9916e79fb1e|title=Applying Architecture and Ontology to the Splitting and Allying of Enterprises|last=Op 't Land|first=Martin|publisher=TU Delft|year=2008|isbn=978-90-71382-32-1|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociotechnology''' (short for "social technology") is the study of processes on the intersection of [[society]] and [[technology]].&lt;ref name="Bunge1999"&gt;{{citation | last = Bunge | first = Mario | author-link = Mario Bunge | contribution = Sociotechnology | editor-last = Bunge | editor-first = Mario | editor-link = Mario Bunge | title = Social science under debate: a philosophical perspective | publisher = University of Toronto Press | location = Toronto, Ontario Buffalo, New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780802083579 | page = 297 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-MLjZzJLbpkC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vojinović and Abbott define it as "the study of processes in which the social and the technical are indivisibly combined".&lt;ref name="VojinovićAbbott2012-164"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Vojinović | first1 = Zoran | last2 = Abbott | first2 = Michael B. | title = Flood risk and social justice: from quantitative to qualitative flood risk assessment and mitigation | publisher = IWA Publishing | location = London | year = 2012 | page = 164 | isbn = 9781843393870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sociotechnology is an important part of socio-technical design, which is defined as "designing things that participate in complex systems that have both social and technical aspects".&lt;ref name=Radziwill2009&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radziwill|first1=Nicole|title=What is Sociotechnology?|url=https://qualityandinnovation.com/2009/01/19/what-is-sociotechnology/|website=Quality and Innovation|accessdate=27 February 2017|date=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been attributed to [[Mario Bunge]].&lt;ref name="WeingartnerDorn1990"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Weingartner | first1 = Paul | last2 = Dorn | first2 = Georg J. W. | title = Studies on Mario Bunge's Treatise | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam Atlanta, Georgia | year = 1990 | page = 426 | isbn = 9789051831870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines it as a grouping of [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[management science]].&lt;ref name="Farmer1995"&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = David John | author-link = David John Farmer | title = The language of public administration: bureaucracy, modernity, and postmodernity | publisher = University of Alabama Press | location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama | year = 1995 | page = 95 | isbn = 9780817307844 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TxDGwJq_FOoC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees it thus as a form of technology, distinguished from other branches of it such as [[engineering]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]] and [[general technology]]. Its goal is to help engineer [[sociosystems]] and evaluate their performance, while making use of [[social science]] research.&lt;ref name="Farmer1995"/&gt; In short, sociotechnology can be seen as the creation, modification and maintenance of social systems.&lt;ref name="WeingartnerDorn1990"/&gt;

Writing on sociotechnical change, [[Wiebe Bijker|Bijker]] wrote: "Society is not [[Technological determinism|determined by technology]], nor is technology determined by society. Both emerge as two sides of the sociotechnical coin."&lt;ref name="Bijker1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bijker | first = Wiebe E. | author-link = Wiebe Bijker | title = Of bicycles, bakelites, and bulbs: toward a theory of sociotechnical change | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1997 | page = 274 | isbn = 9780262522274 |url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology is the sum of ways in which social groups construct the material objects of their civilizations. The things made are socially constructed just as much as technically constructed. The merging of these two things, construction and insight, is sociotechnology. "For example, we typically build a bridge when there’s some expectation that people need to get from Point A to Point B, and there’s something they need to bypass along the way (e.g. a river, a canyon, another road). Failure to consider the social factors as well as the technical factors could lead to a "bridge to nowhere" – and we all know at least one person who’s had a problem with those"&lt;ref name=Radziwill2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Business==

Business use "richness and reach". The richness and reach strategy has evolved with technology. Richness is the ability to understand the information being passed for example calling someone is less rich than face to face contact. Reach is the number of people who exchange the information. In the past it was easier to complete richness and reach, but now with new technologies like video chatting, it is easier for business to do fulfill both richness and reach. Positive economics is the study of existing (or historical) means of exchange- a social science such as sociology, history, and political sciences. Normative economics is the social technology because it attempts to create different kinds of economic arrangements.

==Community and technology==

Accelerating growth of technology is a major problem and cause of destabilization of a communicational world. [[Paul Virilio]] believes that the "real" is being mistaken by virtual and the virtual world destroys physical presence. [[Marshall McLuhan]] wrote about the extension of human senses and the nervous system into the world through electronic media. Essentially he believes that the mind, the self, and consciousness are made from already created technology, media, and language as opposed to create naturally like those who made technology, media, and language. The image of one’s self becomes aware of itself in a world of technology. Consciousness and desire become less individualistic and turns into more already constituted social forms. The response to how someone feels something, what it means, and how it feels (for example feeling "attached" to someone after losing your virginity to them) is already set up through media communication (show, music, movies, articles). People will anticipate that they will be attached because of what they already know about it, so when it happens they do feel attached because that is how they were programmed to feel. People have turned to technology to create their "self" and determine how they feel and act. The conscious mind does not move into a world-as-other mindset but into an already constituted world.

Lewis Mumford believed the world of relying on technology began with early human experiments in industrialization including coal mines because coal and iron built and powered industrialization. It has come to the point where communication is relied on technology. Conversation turned into talking through a machine (texting, phone calls, social media).

The difference between the past and present technology is the extent of social binding. The more social forces it binds together the more powerful the technology is. For example, the attack on the World Trade Center as opposed to the attack of Pearl Harbor. It took a year to see the film of the attack on the American battleships. Because of this, people were more unaware and it was less of a big deal than what 9-11 was. During the terrorist attack in 2001, everything was broadcast in the moment. People were seeing the destruction with their own eyes in the moment, causing more ridicule and passion for the situation.

==Robots replacing people==
{{Further|Technological unemployment|Social robot}}
Furbie and Tamagotchi are electronic toys made for children that make noises and demand for care. These toys caused children to form a companionship with robots instead of human beings. Paro is a robotic baby seal that was created in Japan to perform therapeutic functions. Paro had positive psychological results for those in nursing homes. A woman constantly argued with her son and turned to the Paro for comfort and confided in the Paro instead of fixing things with her son. Society has turned to demanding more intimacy from sociable robots then from each other. People that use the robots for comfort feel like they are being comforted by someone even though they are actually alone. These robotic characters cause people to have a relationship with technology while avoiding the trouble of human interaction.

==Social technology==

Science and technology are big contributions to the economic development, but can also lead to negative side effects as it evolves. For example, people care more about materialistic things than the negative influences they have created in human morals and education. For example, it is more important for people to know words to songs than to remember things for their test. There are other problems due to the development of new technologies such as the conservation of the environment because there is a demand for more products which leads to more destruction of environment to build more to sell from. Many social problems have appeared in society and cannot seem to be solved by natural science and technology alone. It requires the need for social sciences as well. Social technology is the strategy used to help solve the wrong behaviors in the world that are caused by social problems like how to solve the issue of people being invested in materialistic goods more than morals, so that they economy can still continue to grow, and society can be a better place.

For example, the VSWR value 1.2:1 denotes an AC voltage due to standing waves along the transmission line reaching a peak value 1.2 times that of the minimum AC voltage along that line. The SWR can as well be defined as the ratio of the maximum amplitude to minimum amplitude of the transmission line's [[Current (electricity)|current]]s, [[electric field strength]], or the magnetic field strength. Neglecting transmission line loss, these ratios are identical.

The '''power standing wave ratio''' ('''PSWR''') is defined as the square of the VSWR,&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Silver, ''Microwave Antenna Theory and Design'', p. 28, IEE, 1984 (originally published 1949) {{ISBN|0863410170}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this deprecated terminology has no physical relation to actual powers involved in transmission.

SWR is usually measured using a dedicated instrument called an [[SWR meter]]. Since SWR is a measure of the load impedance relative to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line in use (which together determine the [[reflection coefficient]] as described [[#Relationship to the reflection coefficient|below]]), a given SWR meter can only interpret the impedance it sees in terms of SWR if it has been designed for that particular characteristic impedance. In practice most transmission lines used in these applications are [[coaxial cables]] with an impedance of either 50 or 75 [[ohm]]s, so most SWR meters correspond to one of these.

Checking the SWR is a standard procedure in a radio station. Although the same information could be obtained by measuring the load's impedance with an [[impedance analyzer]] (or "impedance bridge"), the SWR meter is simpler and more robust for this purpose. By measuring the magnitude of the impedance mismatch at the transmitter output it reveals problems due to either the antenna or the transmission line.

==Impedance matching==
{{Main|Impedance matching}}
SWR is used as a measure of [[impedance matching]] of a load to the [[characteristic impedance]] of a transmission line carrying [[radio frequency]] (RF) signals. This especially applies to transmission lines connecting [[transmitter|radio transmitters]] and receivers with their [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s, as well as similar uses of RF cables such as [[cable television]] connections to TV receivers and [[distribution amplifier]]s. Impedance matching is achieved when the source impedance is the [[complex conjugate]] of the load impedance. The easiest way of achieving this, and the way that minimizes losses along the transmission line, is for both the source and load to be [[complex numbers|real]], that is, pure resistances, equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. When there is a mismatch between the load impedance and the transmission line, part of the forward wave sent toward the load is reflected back along the transmission line towards the source. The source then sees a different impedance than it expects which can lead to lesser (or in some cases, more) power being supplied by it, the result being very sensitive to the [[electrical length]] of the transmission line.

Such a mismatch is usually undesired and results in [[standing waves]] along the transmission line which magnifies transmission line losses (significant at higher frequencies and for longer cables).  The SWR is a measure of the depth of those standing waves and is, therefore, a measure of the matching of the load to the transmission line. A matched load would result in an SWR of 1:1 implying no reflected wave.  An infinite SWR represents complete reflection by a load unable to absorb electrical power, with all the incident power reflected back towards the source.

It should be understood that the match of a load to the transmission line is different from the match of a ''source'' to the transmission line or the match of a source to the load ''seen through'' the transmission line. For instance, if there is a perfect match between the load impedance ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt; and the source impedance ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;source&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt;, that perfect match will remain if the source and load are connected through a transmission line with an electrical length of one half wavelength (or a multiple of one half wavelengths) using a transmission line of ''any'' characteristic impedance ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. However the SWR will generally not be 1:1, depending only on ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt; and ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. With a different length of transmission line, the source will see a different impedance than ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt; which may or may not be a good match to the source. Sometimes this is deliberate, as when a [[Quarter-wave impedance transformer|quarter-wave matching section]] is used to improve the match between an otherwise mismatched source and load.

However typical [[radio frequency|RF]] sources such as transmitters and signal generators are designed to look into a purely resistive load impedance such as 50Ω or 75Ω, corresponding to common transmission lines' characteristic impedances. In those cases, matching the load to the transmission line, ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''always'' ensures that the source will see the same load impedance as if the transmission line weren't there. This is identical to a 1:1 SWR. This condition ( ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt;=''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) also means that the load seen by the source is independent of the transmission line's electrical length. Since the electrical length of a physical segment of transmission line depends on the signal frequency, violation of this condition means that the impedance seen by the source through the transmission line becomes a function of frequency (especially if the line is long), even if ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;load&lt;/sub&gt; is frequency-independent. So in practice, a good SWR (near 1:1) implies a transmitter's output seeing the exact impedance it expects for optimum and safe operation.

==Relationship to the reflection coefficient==
[[File:Standing wave 2.gif|thumb|350px|right|Incident wave (blue) is fully reflected (red wave) out of phase at short-circuited end of transmission line, creating a net voltage (black) standing wave. Γ = −1, SWR = ∞.]]

The voltage component of a standing wave in a uniform [[transmission line]] consists of the forward wave (with [[Phasor|complex]] amplitude &lt;math&gt;V_f&lt;/math&gt;) superimposed on the reflected wave (with complex amplitude &lt;math&gt;V_r&lt;/math&gt;).

A wave is partly reflected when a transmission line is terminated with other than an impedance equal to its [[characteristic impedance]].  The [[reflection coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; can be defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \frac{V_r}{V_f}.&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = {Z_L - Z_O\over Z_L + Z_O}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a [[complex number]] that describes both the magnitude and the phase shift of the reflection.  The simplest cases with &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; ''measured at the load'' are:
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = -1&lt;/math&gt;: complete negative reflection, when the line is short-circuited,
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = 0&lt;/math&gt;: no reflection, when the line is perfectly matched,
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = +1&lt;/math&gt;: complete positive reflection, when the line is open-circuited.

The SWR directly corresponds to the [[magnitude (mathematics)#Complex numbers|magnitude]] of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

At some points along the line the forward and reflected waves [[Interference (wave propagation)|interfere]] constructively, exactly in phase, with the resulting amplitude &lt;math&gt;V_\text{max}&lt;/math&gt; given by the sum of their those waves' amplitudes:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  |V_\text{max}| &amp;= |V_f| + |V_r| \\
                 &amp;= |V_f| + |\Gamma V_f| \\
                 &amp;= (1 + |\Gamma|) |V_f|.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

At other points, the waves interfere 180° out of phase with the amplitudes partially cancelling:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  |V_\text{min}| &amp;= |V_f| - |V_r| \\
                 &amp;= |V_f| - |\Gamma V_f| \\
                 &amp;= (1 - |\Gamma|) |V_f|.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The voltage standing wave ratio is then

:&lt;math&gt;\text{VSWR} = \frac{|V_\text{max}|}{|V_\text{min}|} = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; always falls in the range [0,1], the SWR is always greater than or equal to unity. Note that the ''phase'' of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; vary along the transmission line in opposite directions to each other. Therefore, the complex-valued reflection coefficient &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; varies as well, but only in phase. With the SWR dependent ''only'' on the complex magnitude of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, it can be seen that the SWR measured at ''any'' point along the transmission line (neglecting transmission line losses) obtains an identical reading.

Since the power of the forward and reflected waves are proportional to the square of the voltage components due to each wave, SWR can be expressed in terms of forward and reflected power:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SWR} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{P_r/P_f}}{1 - \sqrt{P_r/P_f}}.&lt;/math&gt;

By sampling the complex voltage and current at the point of insertion, an SWR meter is able to compute the effective forward and reflected voltages on the transmission line for the characteristic impedance for which the SWR meter has been designed. Since the forward and reflected power is related to the square of the forward and reflected voltages, some SWR meters also display the forward and reflected power.

In the special case of a load ''R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is purely resistive but unequal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line ''Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', the SWR is given simply by their ratio:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{SWR} = \left(\frac{R_\text{L}}{Z_\text{0}}\right)^{\pm 1}&lt;/math&gt;

with the ±1 chosen to obtain a value greater than unity.

==The standing wave pattern==
Using [[phasor|complex]] notation for the voltage amplitudes, for a signal at frequency ν, the actual (real) voltages V&lt;sub&gt;actual&lt;/sub&gt; as a function of time ''t'' are understood to relate to the complex voltages according to:

:&lt;math&gt; V_\text{actual} = \Re (e^{i 2 \pi \nu t} V) &lt;/math&gt; .

Thus taking the real part of the complex quantity inside the parenthesis, the actual voltage consists of a [[sine wave]] at frequency ν with a peak amplitude equal to the complex magnitude of V, and with a phase given by the phase of the complex V. Then with the position along a transmission line given by x, with the line ending in a load located at x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the complex amplitudes of the forward and reverse waves would be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  V_f(x) &amp;= e^{-i k(x-x_0)} A \\
  V_r(x) &amp;= \Gamma e^{i k(x-x_0)} A
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

for some complex amplitude A (corresponding to the forward wave at x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;). Here ''k'' is the [[wavenumber]] due to the guided wavelength along the transmission line. Note that some treatments use phasors where the time dependence is according to &lt;math&gt;e^{-i 2 \pi \nu t}&lt;/math&gt; and spatial dependence (for a wave in the +x direction) of &lt;math&gt;e^{+i k(x - x_0)}&lt;/math&gt;. Either convention obtains the same result for V&lt;sub&gt;actual&lt;/sub&gt;.

According to the [[superposition principle]] the net voltage present at any point x on the transmission line is equal to the sum of the voltages due to the forward and reflected waves:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  V_\text{net}(x) &amp;= V_f(x) + V_r(x) \\
                  &amp;= e^{-i k(x - x_0)} \left( 1 + \Gamma e^{i 2k(x - x_0)}\right ) A
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since we are interested in the variations of the ''magnitude'' of V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; along the line (as a function of x), we shall solve instead for the squared magnitude of that quantity, which simplifies the mathematics. To obtain the squared magnitude we multiply the above quantity by its complex conjugate:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  |V_\text{net}(x)|^2 &amp;= V_\text{net}(x)  V^*_\text{net}(x) \\
                 &amp;= e^{-i k(x - x_0)} \left(1 + \Gamma e^{i 2k(x - x_0)}\right) A \,  e^{+i k(x - x_0)} \left(1 + \Gamma^* e^{-i 2k(x - x_0)}\right) A^* \\
                 &amp;= \left[1 + |\Gamma|^2 + 2 \Re (\Gamma  e^{i 2k(x - x_0)})\right] |A|^2
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Depending on the phase of the third term, the maximum and minimum values of V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; (the square root of the quantity in the equations) are (1 + |Γ|)|A| and (1 − |Γ|)|A| respectively, for a standing wave ratio of:

:&lt;math&gt; \text{SWR} =  \frac{|V_\text{max}|}{|V_\text{min}|}  = \frac{1 + |\Gamma|}{1 - |\Gamma|}&lt;/math&gt;

as earlier asserted. Along the line, the above expression for &lt;math&gt; |V_\text{net}(x)|^2&lt;/math&gt; is seen to oscillate sinusoidally between &lt;math&gt;|V_\text{min}|^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|V_\text{max}|^2&lt;/math&gt; with a period of 2π/2k. This is ''half'' of the guided wavelength λ = 2π/k for the frequency ν. That can be seen as due to interference between two waves of that frequency which are travelling in ''opposite'' directions.

For example, at a frequency ν=20&amp;nbsp;MHz (free space wavelength of 15 m) in a transmission line whose [[velocity factor]] is 2/3, the guided wavelength (distance between voltage peaks of the forward wave alone) would be λ = 10 m. At instances when the forward wave at x = 0 is at zero phase (peak voltage) then at x = 10 m it would also be at zero phase, but at x = 5 m it would be at 180° phase (peak ''negative'' voltage). On the other hand, the magnitude of the voltage due to a standing wave produced by its addition to a reflected wave, would have a wavelength between peaks of only λ/2 = 5 m. Depending on the location of the load and phase of reflection, there might be a peak in the magnitude of V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt; at x = 1.3 m. Then there would be another peak found where  |V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt;|=V&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; at x = 6.3 m, whereas it would find minima of the standing wave  |V&lt;sub&gt;net&lt;/sub&gt;| = V&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; at x = 3.8 m, 8.8 m, etc.

==Practical implications of SWR==
The most common case for measuring and examining SWR is when installing and tuning transmitting [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s.  When a transmitter is connected to an antenna by a [[feed line]], the [[Antenna (radio)#Impedance|driving point impedance]] of the antenna must match the characteristic impedance of the feed line in order for the transmitter to see the impedance it was designed for (the impedance of the feed line, usually 50 or 75 ohms).

The impedance of a particular antenna design can vary due to a number of factors that cannot always be clearly identified. This includes the transmitter frequency (as compared to the antenna's design or [[Antenna (radio)#Resonant frequency|resonant]] frequency), the antenna's height above the ground and proximity to large metal structures, and variations in the exact size of the conductors used to construct the antenna.&lt;ref name="ARRL20.2"&gt;{{cite book

When an antenna and feed line do not have matching impedances, the transmitter sees an unexpected impedance, where it might not be able to produce its full power, and can even damage the transmitter in some cases.&lt;ref name="ARRL19.4"&gt;{{cite book

It is the interaction of these reflected waves with forward waves which causes standing wave patterns,&lt;ref name="ARRL19.4" /&gt; with the negative repercussions we have noted.&lt;ref name="ARRL19.13"&gt;{{cite book

Matching the impedance of the antenna to the impedance of the feed line can sometimes be accomplished through adjusting the antenna itself, but otherwise is possible using an [[antenna tuner]], an impedance matching device. Installing the tuner between the feed line and the antenna allows for the feed line to see a load close to its characteristic impedance, while sending most of the transmitter's power (a small amount may be dissipated within the tuner) to be radiated by the antenna despite its otherwise unacceptable feed point impedance. Installing a tuner in between the transmitter and the feed line can also transform the impedance seen at the transmitter end of the feed line to one preferred by the transmitter. However, in the latter case, the feed line still has a high SWR present, with the resulting increased feed line losses unmitigated.

The magnitude of those losses are dependent on the type of transmission line, and its length. They always increase with frequency. For example, a certain antenna used well away from its resonant frequency may have an SWR of 6:1. For a frequency of 3.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, with that antenna fed through 75 meters of RG-8A coax, the loss due to standing waves would be 2.2&amp;nbsp;dB. However the same 6:1 mismatch through 75 meters of RG-8A coax would incur 10.8&amp;nbsp;dB of loss at 146&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="ARRL19.4" /&gt; Thus, a better match of the antenna to the feed line, that is, a lower SWR, becomes increasingly important with increasing frequency, even if the transmitter is able to accommodate the impedance seen (or an antenna tuner is used between the transmitter and feed line).

Certain types of transmissions can suffer other negative effects from reflected waves on a transmission line.  Analog TV can experience "ghosts" from delayed signals bouncing back and forth on a long line.  FM stereo can also be affected and digital signals can experience delayed pulses leading to bit errors. Whenever the delay times for a signal going back down and then again up the line are comparable to the modulation time constants, effects occur.  For this reason, these types of transmissions require a low SWR on the feedline, even if SWR induced loss might be acceptable and matching is done at the transmitter.

==Methods of measuring standing wave ratio==



[[File:Slotted_line.png|200px|thumb|Slotted line. The probe moves along the line to measure the variable voltage. SWR is the maximum divided by the minimum voltage]]Many different methods can be used to measure standing wave ratio.  The most intuitive method uses a [[slotted line]] which is a section of transmission line with an open slot which allows a probe to detect the actual voltage at various points along the line.&lt;ref&gt;Fredrick E. Terman, ''Electronic Measurements'', McGraw Hill, 1952 Library of Congress Catalog Number: 51-12650 p.135ff&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the maximum and minimum values can be compared directly. This method is used at VHF and higher frequencies. At lower frequencies, such lines are impractically long.


[[Power dividers and directional couplers|Directional couplers]] can be used at HF through microwave frequencies. Some are a quarter wave or more long, which restricts their use to the higher frequencies. Other types of directional couplers sample the current and voltage at a single point in the transmission path and mathematically combine them in such a way as to represent the power flowing in one direction.&lt;ref name="Schulz"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://ham.stackexchange.com/questions/9778/how-does-an-swr-meter-really-work/9779#9779|title=How Does an SWR Meter Really Work|work=Glenn B. Schulz W9IQ |date= January 24, 2018|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The common type of  SWR/power meter used in amateur operation may contain a dual directional coupler. Other types use a single coupler which can be rotated 180 degrees to sample power flowing in either direction. Unidirectional couplers of this type are available for many frequency ranges  and  power levels and with appropriate coupling values for the analog meter used.[[File:Bird 43 RF power meter.jpg|300px|thumb|A directional wattmeter using a rotatable directional coupler element]] The forward and reflected power measured by directional couplers can be used to calculate SWR.  The computations can be done mathematically in analog or digital form or by using graphical methods built into the meter as an additional scale or by reading from the crossing point between two needles on the same meter. 
The above measuring instruments can be used "in line" that is, the full power of the transmitter can pass through the measuring device so as to allow continuous monitoring of SWR.  Other instruments, such as network analyzers, low power directional couplers and antenna bridges use low power for the measurement and must be connected in place of the transmitter.  Bridge circuits can be used to directly measure the real and imaginary parts of a load impedance and to use those values to derive SWR. These methods can provide more information than just SWR or forward and reflected power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nautel.com/press-releases/nautel-adds-two-models-to-nx-series/ |title=Nautel Adds Two Models to NX Series |work=[[Nautel]] |date=March 11, 2015 |accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stand alone antenna analyzers use various measuring methods and can display SWR and other parameters plotted against frequency.  By using directional couplers and a bridge in combination, it is possible to make an in line instrument that reads directly in complex impedance or in SWR. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.deltaelectronics.com/data/oib1&amp;3.htm).&lt;/ref&gt; Stand alone [[antenna analyzer]]s also are available that measure multiple parameters.

==Power standing wave ratio==

The term ''power standing wave ratio'' (PSWR) is sometimes referred to, and defined as, the square of the voltage standing wave ratio. The term is widely cited as "misleading."&lt;ref&gt;Christian Wolff, [http://www.radartutorial.eu/03.linetheory/tl06.en.html "Standing Wave Ratio"], radartutorial.eu&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Gridley:&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Gridley, ''Principles of Electrical Transmission Lines in Power and Communication'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=geNbAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA265 p. 265], Elsevier, 2014 {{ISBN|1483186032}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The expression "power standing-wave ratio", which may sometimes be encountered is even more misleading, for the power distribution along a loss-free line is constant.....|J. H. Gridley}}

However it does correspond to one type of measurement of SWR using what was formerly a standard measuring instrument at microwave frequencies, the [[slotted line]]. The slotted line is a [[waveguide]] (or air-filled coaxial line) in which a small sensing antenna which is part of a ''crystal detector'' or ''detector'' is placed in the electric field in the line. The voltage induced in the antenna is rectified by either a [[diode#Semiconductor diodes|point contact diode (crystal rectifier)]] or a [[Schottky barrier diode]] that is incorporated in the detector.  These detectors have a square law output for low levels of input.  Readings therefore corresponded to the square of the electric field along the slot, ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''), with maximum and minimum readings of ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; and  ''E''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; found  as the probe is moved along the slot. The ratio of these yields the ''square'' of the SWR, the so-called PSWR.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Vincent Rollin, ''An Introduction to Electronics'', p. 209, Clarendon Press, 1964 {{OCLC|1148924}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.

It should be noted, however, that this technique of rationalization of terms is fraught with problems. The square law behavior of the detector diode is only exhibited when the voltage across the diode is below the knee of the diode. Once the detected voltage exceeds the knee, the response of the diode becomes nearly linear. In this mode the diode and its associated filtering capacitor produce a voltage that is proportional to the peak of the sampled voltage. The operator of such a detector would not have a ready indication as to the mode in which the detector diode is operating and therefore differentiating the results between SWR or so called PSWR is not practical. Perhaps even worse, is the common case where the minimum detected voltage is below the knee and the maximum voltage is above the knee. In this case, the computed results are largely meaningless. Thus the terms PSWR and Power Standing Wave Ratio are deprecated and should only be considered from a legacy measurement perspective.

==Implications of SWR on medical applications==

SWR can also have a detrimental impact upon the performance of microwave-based medical applications. In microwave electrosurgery an antenna that is placed directly into tissue may not always have an optimal match with the feedline resulting in an SWR. The presence of SWR can affect monitoring components used to measure power levels impacting the reliability of such measurements.&lt;ref name="ARRL19.5"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/problems-with-vswr-in-medical-applications|title=Problems with VSWR in Medical Applications|work=microwaves101.com|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3841">In [[psychology]], a '''stimulus''' is any object or event that elicits a sensory or behavioral response in an organism.  

*In [[perceptual psychology]], a stimulus is an energy change (e.g., light or sound) which is registered by the [[sense]]s (e.g., vision, hearing, taste, etc.) and constitutes the basis for [[perception]].&lt;ref name="stimulus"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Stimulus|editor=Richard L. Gregory |title=The Oxford Companion to the Mind|location=Oxford, N.Y.|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In [[behavioral psychology]] (i.e., [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning|operant]] conditioning), a stimulus constitutes the basis for [[behavior]].&lt;ref name="stimulus" /&gt; In this context, a distinction is made between the ''distal stimulus'' (the external, perceived object) and the ''proximal stimulus'' (the stimulation of sensory organs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.learner.org/series/discoveringpsychology/07/e07glossary.html | title=7: Sensation and Perception | work=Annenberg Learner | accessdate=August 15, 2016 | series=Discovering Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In [[experimental psychology]], a stimulus is the event or object to which a response is measured. Thus, not everything that is presented to participants qualifies as stimulus. For example, a [[cross mark]] at the center of a screen is not said to be a stimulus, because it merely serves to center participants' gaze on the screen. Also, it is uncommon to refer to longer events (e.g. the [[Trier social stress test]]) as a stimulus, even if a response to such an event is measured.

==History==
In the second half of the 19th century, the term ''stimulus'' was coined in [[psychophysics]] by defining the field as the "scientific study of the relation between stimulus and [[Sensation (psychology)|sensation]]".&lt;ref name=GescheiderpIX&gt;{{cite book |author=Gescheider, G. |year=1997 |title=Psychophysics: the fundamentals |edition=3rd |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |page=ix |isbn=0-8058-2281-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have led [[James J. Gibson]] to conclude that "whatever could be controlled by an experimenter and applied to an observer could be thought of as a stimulus" in early psychological studies with humans, while around the same time, the term stimulus described anything eliciting a [[reflex]] in animal research.&lt;ref name="Gibson, James J. 1960 pp. 694"&gt;Gibson, James J. (1960): "The Concept of the Stimulus in Psychology". ''[[American Psychologist]]'', 15, pp. 694–703, here p.694.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===In behavioral psychology===
The concept ''stimulus'' was essential to [[behaviorism]] and the behavioral theory of [[B. F. Skinner]] in particular. Within such a framework several kinds of stimuli have been distinguished (see also [[classical conditioning]]):

An '''eliciting stimulus''' was defined as a stimulus that precedes a certain behavior and thus causes a response. A '''discriminative stimulus''' in contrast increases the probability of a response to occur, but does not necessarily elicit the response. A '''reinforcing stimulus''' usually denoted a stimulus delivered after the response has already occurred; in psychological experiments it was often delivered on purpose to reinforce the behavior. '''Emotional stimuli''' were regarded as not eliciting a response. Instead, they were thought to modify the strength or vigor with which a behavior is carried out.&lt;ref name = "Skinner"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|title=The Behavior of Organisms:  An Experimental Analysis|year=1938|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buddhism, the '''three marks of existence''' are three characteristics ([[Pali]]: ''tilakkha{{IAST|ṇ}}a''; [[Sanskrit]]: ''trilak{{IAST|ṣ}}a{{IAST|ṇ}}a'') of all existence and beings, namely '''[[impermanence]]''' (''anicca''), '''unsatisfactoriness''' or '''suffering''' (''[[dukkha]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins|title=Nirvana and Other Buddhist Felicities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2go_y5KYyoC |year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57054-1 |pages=140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''non-self''' (''[[anattā]]'').&lt;ref name=gombrich47&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "All phenomenal existence [in Buddhism] is said to have three interlocking characteristics: impermanence, suffering and lack of soul or essence."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=buswelllopez42&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert E.

==Description==
The three marks are:{{sfn|Walsh|1995|p=30}}
# ''sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā'' — "all ''[[saṅkhāra]]s'' (conditioned things) are impermanent"
# ''sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā'' — "all ''saṅkhāras'' are unsatisfactory"
# ''sabbe dhammā anattā'' — "all ''[[dharma#Buddhism)|dharmas]]'' (conditioned or unconditioned things) are not self"

==Explanation==
===Anicca===
{{Main|Impermanence}}
Impermanence (Pali ''anicca'', [[Sanskrit]] ''anitya'') means that all conditioned things (''saṅkhāra'') are in a constant state of flux. Buddhism states that all physical and mental events come into being and dissolve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anicca Anicca Buddhism], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Human life embodies this flux in the aging process, the cycle of repeated birth and death ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Samsara]]), nothing lasts, and everything decays. This is applicable to all beings and their environs, including beings who are [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reborn]] in [[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]] ([[deity|god]]) and [[naraka]] (hell) realms.&lt;ref name=damienkeown32&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Keown |title=Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QXX0Uq29aoC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966383-5 |pages=32–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2012p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=32–33, 38–39, 46–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to [[nirvana]], the reality that is ''nicca'', or knows no change, decay or death.&lt;ref name="DavidsStede1921p355"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=355, Article on '''Nicca''' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dukkha===
{{Main|Dukkha}}
''[[Dukkha]]'' (Sanskrit ''duhkha'') means "unsatisfactoriness, suffering, pain".&lt;ref name=peterharvey26&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|editor=Steven M.

===Anatta===
{{Main|Anatta}}
''[[Anatta]]'' (Sanskrit ''anatman'') refers to the doctrine of "non-self", that there is no unchanging, permanent Self or soul in living beings and no abiding essence in anything or phenomena.&lt;ref name=britannicaanatta&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/anatta Anatta Buddhism], Encyclopædia Britannica (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Christmas Humphreys|title=Exploring Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V3rYtmCZEIEC |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-22877-3 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author=Brian Morris |title=Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PguGB_uEQh4C&amp;pg=PA51 |year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85241-8|pages=51 }}, '''Quote:''' "(...) anatta is the doctrine of non-self, and is an extreme empiricist doctrine that holds that the notion of an unchanging permanent self is a fiction and has no reality. According to Buddhist doctrine, the individual person consists of five skandhas or heaps - the body, feelings, perceptions, impulses and consciousness. The belief in a self or soul, over these five skandhas, is illusory and the cause of suffering."&lt;br&gt;[c] {{cite book|author=Richard Gombrich|title=Theravada Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZyJAgAAQBAJ|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-90352-8|page=47}}, '''Quote:''' "(...) Buddha's teaching that beings have no soul, no abiding essence. This 'no-soul doctrine' (anatta-vada) he expounded in his second sermon."&lt;/ref&gt;

While anicca and dukkha apply to "all conditioned phenomena" (saṅkhārā), anattā has a wider scope because it applies to all dhammā without "conditioned, unconditioned" qualification.&lt;ref name=Gombrich2008p209&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Francis Gombrich|author2=Cristina Anna Scherrer-Schaub|title=Buddhist Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7_Rea05eAMC |year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3248-0|pages=209, for context see pp. 195–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''nirvana'' too is a state of "without Self" or anatta.&lt;ref name=Gombrich2008p209/&gt; The phrase "sabbe dhamma anatta" includes within its scope each [[skandha]] (aggregate, heap) that compose any being, and the belief "I am" is a mark of conceit which must be destroyed to end all Dukkha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joaquín Pérez Remón |title=Self and Non-self in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQ6svBmxAhEC |year=1980|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-90-279-7987-2 |pages=218–222, 234 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anattā'' doctrine of Buddhism denies that there is anything called a 'Self' in any person or anything else, and that a belief in 'Self' is a source of ''Dukkha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey|title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85942-4|pages=57–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey| editor=Steven M.

==Application==
In Buddhism, ignorance of ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]], or [[Moha (Buddhism)|moha]]; i.e. a failure to grasp directly) the three marks of existence is regarded as the first link in the overall process of [[saṃsāra]] whereby a being is subject to repeated existences in an endless cycle of suffering. As a consequence, dissolving that ignorance through [[Vipassanā|direct insight]] into the three marks is said to bring an end to saṃsāra and, as a result, to that suffering (''dukkha nirodha'' or ''nirodha sacca'', as described in the third of the [[Four Noble Truths]]).

[[Gautama Buddha]] taught that all beings conditioned by causes (''saṅkhāra'') are impermanent (''anicca'') and suffering (''dukkha''), and that not-self (''anattā'') characterises all dhammas, meaning there is no "I", "me", or "mine" in either the conditioned or the unconditioned (i.e. nibbāna).&lt;ref&gt;Nārada, The Dhammapada (1978), pp. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bhikkhu|last=Bodhi|year=2003|title=The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya|page=1457|publisher=Wisdom Publications|location=Somerville, MA|isbn=978-0-86171-331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teaching of three marks of existence in the Pali Canon is credited to the Buddha.&lt;ref name=Gombrich2008p209/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dhammapada Verses 277, 278 and 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joaquín Pérez Remón |title=Self and Non-self in Early Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQ6svBmxAhEC |year=1980|publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-90-279-7987-2 |pages=210–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Total depravity''' (also called '''radical corruption''' or '''pervasive depravity''') is a Christian [[theology|theological]] [[doctrine]] derived from the concept of [[original sin]]. It is the teaching that, as a consequence of [[the Fall of Man]], every person born into the world is enslaved to the service of [[sin]] as a result of their fallen nature and, apart from the [[irresistible grace|efficacious]] or [[prevenient grace|prevenient]] [[Grace in Christianity|grace of God]], is utterly unable to choose to follow [[God in Christianity|God]], refrain from [[evil]], or accept the gift of [[salvation in Christianity|salvation]] as it is offered.

It is advocated to various degrees by many Protestant confessions of faith and catechisms, including those of some [[Lutheran]] synods,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1= Andreä|first1=Jakob|author1-link=Jakob Andreä|last2=Chemnitz|first2=Martin |author2-link= Martin Chemnitz |last3=Selnecker|first3= Nikolaus |author3-link= Nikolaus Selnecker|last4= Chytraeus|first4= David|author4-link=David Chytraeus|last5=Musculus|first5= Andreas |author5-link= Andreas Musculus |last6= Körner|first6= Christoph|title=Solid Declaration of the Formula of Concord|year=1577|url= http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds3.iii.iv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Augsburg Confession |editor-last= Melanchthon|editor-first= Philip|editor-link=Philip Melanchthon|year=1530|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Augsburg_Confession}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=August 2018}} and [[Calvinism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Canons of Dordrecht]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/canons_of_dordt.html "The Third and Fourth Main Points of Doctrine"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Westminster Assembly|title= Westminster Confession of Faith |authorlink= Westminster Assembly|year= 1646 |url= http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Westminster_Confession_of_Faith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Westminster Larger Catechism]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/wlc_w_proofs/WLC_001-050.html Question 25].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Heidelberg Catechism]], [http://www.reformed.org/documents/heidelberg.html question 8].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arminianism |Arminians]], such as [[Methodist]]s, believe and teach total depravity, but with distinct differences.&lt;ref&gt;Arminius, James ''The Writings of James Arminius'' (three vols.), tr.

Bagnall (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1956), I:252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= MQR/&gt; The key distinction between the total depravity embraced by Calvin and the total depravity taught by Arminius is the distinction between [[irresistible grace]] and [[prevenient grace]].

== History ==
In opposition to [[Pelagius]], who believed that after the [[fall of man|fall]] people are able to choose not to sin, [[Augustine of Hippo]] argued that, since the fall, all humanity is in self-imposed bondage to sin. All people are inescapably predisposed to evil prior to making any actual choice, and are unable to not sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Human Being|last= Kelsey|first=David H.|author-link=David Kelsey|title= Christian Theology: An Introduction to Its Traditions and Tasks|editor-last1=Hodgson|editor-first1= Peter C.|editor-last2=King|editor-first2=Robert H.|year=1994|publisher= [[Fortress Press]]{{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}|url=https://www.questia.com/library/117838118/christian-theology-an-introduction-to-its-traditions|pages=176–78}}

[[Duns Scotus]], however, modified this interpretation and only believed that sin entailed a lack of original righteousness. During the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Reformers took Scotus's position to be the Catholic position and argued that it made sin only a defect or privation of righteousness rather than an inclination toward evil. [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]] and other Reformers used the term "total depravity" to articulate what they claimed to be the Augustinian view that sin corrupts the entire human nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Sin and Evil|last= Williams|first=Robert R.|title=Christian Theology: An Introduction to Its Traditions and Tasks|editor-last1=Hodgson|editor-first1= Peter C.|editor-last2=King|editor-first2= Robert H.|year= 1994|publisher= [[Fortress Press]]{{Subscription required |via= [[Questia]]}}|url=https://www.questia.com/library/117838118/christian-theology-an-introduction-to-its-traditions |page =204}}&lt;/ref&gt; This did not, however, mean the loss of the ''[[imago Dei]]'' (image of God).

[[John Calvin]] used terms like "total depravity" to mean that, despite the ability of people to outwardly uphold the [[Divine Law|law]], there remained an inward distortion which makes all human actions displeasing to God, whether or not they are outwardly good or bad.&lt;ref name= "Muller 2012" /&gt; Even after [[regeneration (theology)|regeneration]], every human action is mixed with evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= John Calvin: A Sixteenth-Century Portrait|last= Bouwsma |first=William J. |page= 139|url= https://www.questia.com/read/79070626/john-calvin-a-sixteenth-century-portrait |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]{{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Calvinist theologians were agreed on this, but the language of the [[Canons of Dort]] as well as the 17th-century Reformed theologians which followed it did not repeat the language of "total depravity", and arguably offer a more moderate view on the state of fallen humanity than Calvin.&lt;ref name="Muller 2012"/&gt;

[[Arminianism]] also accepts a doctrine of total depravity, although not identical to the Calvinist position.  Total depravity was affirmed by the [[Five articles of Remonstrance]], by [[Jacobus Arminius]] himself, and by [[John Wesley]], who strongly identified with Arminius through publication of his periodical ''The Arminian'' and also advocated a strong doctrine of inability.&lt;ref&gt;Sermon 44, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wesley/sermons.v.xliv.html#v.xliv-p0.2 "Original Sin."]; compare verse 4 of [[Charles Wesley]]'s [[hymn]] [http://gbgm-umc.org/umhistory/wesley/hymns/umh363.stm "And Can It Be"].&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Methodist Quarterly Review'' states that
{{quote|It is not sufficiently known, we opine, that Methodists—the genuine Arminians of the present—do not entirely agree with this view of depravity. To what has been said, as being the Calvinist view of the total depravity of our nature, we do heartily assent, with the following exceptions:—First. We do not think that all men ''continue totally depraved until their regeneration''. Secondly. We think man, ''under the atonement'', is not, properly speaking, in a state of nature. He is not left to the unalleviated evils of total depravity. The atonement has not only secured grace ''for'' him, but a measure ''in'' him, by virtue of which he not only has moral light, but is often incited to good desires, and well-intended efforts to do what is perceived to be the divine will.&lt;ref name=MQR&gt;{{cite journal|editor=George Peck, D.D.|year=1847|journal=The Methodist Quarterly Review|publisher=Lane &amp; Tippett|location=New York|volume=XXIX|page=444}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Some Reformed theologians have mistakenly used the term "[[Arminianism]]" to include some who hold the [[Semipelagianism|Semipelagian]] doctrine of [[limited depravity]], which allows for an "island of righteousness" in human hearts that is uncorrupted by sin and able to accept God's offer of salvation without a special dispensation of grace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Demarest | first = Bruce | title = The Cross and Salvation: The Doctrine of Salvation | publisher = Crossway Books | location = Wheaton, IL | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-1-58134-812-5 | page = 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Arminius and Wesley both vehemently rejected this view, it has sometimes inaccurately been lumped together with theirs (particularly by Calvinists) because of other similarities between their respective systems such as [[conditional election]], [[unlimited atonement]], and prevenient grace. In particular, prevenient grace is viewed by some as giving humans back the freedom to follow God in one way or another.

== Theology ==

The term "total depravity", as understood in colloquial English, obscures the theological issues involved. One cannot simply look at the two words and conjecture upon the extent of the depravity of humanity. For example, Reformed and Lutheran theologians have never considered humans to be absent of goodness or unable to do good outwardly as a result of the fall. People retain the ''imago Dei'', though it has been distorted.&lt;ref name="Muller 2012"/&gt; 

Total depravity is the fallen state of human beings as a result of original sin. The doctrine of total depravity asserts that people are, as a result of the fall, not inclined or even able to love God wholly with heart, mind, and strength, but rather are inclined by nature to serve their own will and desires and reject His rule. Even religion and [[philanthropy]] are wicked to God because they originate from a selfish human desire and are not done to the glory of God. Therefore, in [[Reformed theology]], if God is to save anyone, He must [[Predestination (Calvinism)|predestine]], call, or elect individuals to salvation since fallen man does not want to, and is indeed incapable of, choosing Him.&lt;ref&gt;The ''[[Westminster Confession of Faith]]'',[http://www.reformed.org/documents/wcf_with_proofs/ch_IX.html 9.3]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Arminian theology [[prevenient grace]] (or "enabling grace") does reach through total depravity to enable people to respond to the salvation offered by God in Jesus Christ.

Total depravity does not mean that people have lost part of their humanity or are [[ontologically]] deteriorated. Just as Adam and Eve were created with the ability to not sin, people retain that essential ability to either sin or not sin, even though some properties of their humanity are corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shuster|first=Marguerite|author-link=Marguerite Shuster|title=The Fall and Sin: What We Have Become as Sinners|year=2004|publisher=[[Eerdmans]]{{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pp=159–160, 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also does not mean that people are as evil as possible. Rather, it means that even the good which a person may intend is faulty in its premise, false in its motive, and weak in its implementation; and there is no mere refinement of natural capacities that can correct this condition. Thus, even acts of generosity and altruism are in fact [[psychological egoism|egoist]] acts in disguise. All good, consequently, is derived from God alone, and in no way through humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ra McLaughlin |journal=Reformed Perspectives |title=Total Depravity, part 1 |url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/ra_mclaughlin/TH.McLaughlin.Total_Depravity.1.html|accessdate=2008-07-14 |quote=[Any person] can do outwardly good works, but these works come from a heart that hates God, and therefore fail to meet His righteous standards.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total reach of sin taught with the doctrine of total depravity highlights people's dire need for God. No part of the person is not in need of grace, and all people are in need of grace, no matter how outwardly pious.

It is important to understand the scope of the "total depravity" of humanity in order to understand the Calvinist-Arminian debate.  As noted, both views embrace total depravity; it is a question of the action which they believe God must take to reach humanity in its fallen and depraved state. May God grant to humanity the grace to respond to His offer of salvation, so that all may believe (as Arminius taught)? Or must God's grace be irresistible in order to reach humanity (as Calvin taught), so that it is impossible for anyone to be saved unless God first extends to them His irresistible grace? Stated in this manner, there is no substantial difference in total depravity as embraced by Calvinists and Arminians; both agree that humanity is in a state of depravity which prevents them from responding to God. Rather, the two groups have a different belief in the grace which God extended to humanity in response to total depravity. Calvin taught [[Irresistible Grace]]; Arminius taught [[Prevenient Grace]].

==Roman Catholic and Orthodox perspectives==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] maintains that man cannot, "be justified before God by his own works, ... without the grace of God through Jesus Christ",&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct06.html Council of Trent, Session 6, canon 1].&lt;/ref&gt; thereby rejecting [[Pelagianism]] in accordance with the writings of Augustine and the [[Second Council of Orange]] (529).&lt;ref&gt;[http://reformed.org/documents/canons_of_orange.html Judgements of the Council of Orange]&lt;/ref&gt; However, even strictly Augustinian Catholics disagree with the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] doctrine of total depravity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1C.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] Item 407 in section 1.2.1.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Referring to Scripture and the Church Fathers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P5M.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] Item 1730&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism views human free will as deriving from God's image because humans are created in God's image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P5G.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] Items 1701–9&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the [[Council of Trent]], at its sixth session (January 1547), condemned as heresy any doctrine asserting "since Adam's sin, the free will of man is lost and extinguished".&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct06.html Council of Trent, Session 6, canon 5].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Orthodox Church]] embraces the "semi-Augustinian" position of [[John Cassian]] and also defends [[Augustine of Hippo]] relating to this doctrine. [[Seraphim Rose]], for example, contends that Augustine never denied the free will of every human,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Place of Blessed Augustine in the Orthodox Church | first =Fr. Seraphim | last = Rose |publisher= St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood |year= 1982 |isbn=0-938635-12-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus he never taught total depravity. Archbishop [[Chrysostomos II of Cyprus|Chrysostomos]] has likewise asserted that Augustine's teaching might have been used and distorted in [[Western Christianity]] to produce innovative theologizing, and it is not Augustine's fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= Blessed Augustine of Hippo: His Place in the Orthodox Church - A Corrective Compilation |url= http://orthodoxinfo.com/inquirers/bless_aug.aspx |publisher= Orthodox Christian Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11870">The '''Triffin dilemma''' or '''Triffin paradox''' is the conflict of economic interests that arises between short-term domestic and long-term international objectives for countries whose currencies serve as global [[reserve currency|reserve currencies]]. This dilemma was identified in the 1960s by [[Belgium|Belgian]]-[[United States|American]] economist [[Robert Triffin]],&lt;ref&gt;While named for Triffin, "French economist [[Jacques Rueff]] described the fatal weakness of foreign-exchange reserves in a 1932 lecture." John D. Mueller, Wall Street Journal, October 8, 2018, page A19.&lt;/ref&gt; who pointed out that the country whose currency, being the global reserve currency, foreign nations wish to hold, must be willing to supply the world with an extra supply of its currency to fulfill world demand for these [[foreign exchange reserves]], thus leading to a trade deficit.

The use of a national currency, such as the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], as global reserve currency leads to tension between its national and global monetary policy. This is reflected in fundamental imbalances in the [[balance of payments]], specifically the [[current account]], as some goals require an outflow of dollars from the United States, while others require an overall inflow.

Specifically, the Triffin dilemma is usually cited to articulate the problems with the role of the U.S. dollar as the reserve currency under the [[Bretton Woods system]]. [[John Maynard Keynes]] had anticipated this difficulty and had advocated the use of a global reserve currency called '[[Bancor]]'. Currently the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]'s [[Special drawing rights|SDR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are the closest thing to the proposed Bancor but they have not been adopted widely enough to replace the dollar as the global reserve currency.

In the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], the governor of the [[People's Bank of China]] explicitly named the reserve currency status of the US dollar as a contributing factor to global savings and investment imbalances that led to the crisis. As such the Triffin Dilemma is related to the [[Global saving glut|Global Savings Glut]] hypothesis because the dollar's reserve currency role exacerbates the U.S. current account deficit due to heightened demand for dollars.

==History==
===Onset during Bretton Woods era===
Due to money flowing out of the country through the [[Marshall Plan]], U.S. [[military budget]] and Americans [[international trade|buying foreign goods]], the number of [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]] in circulation exceeded the amount of [[gold]] that was backing them up in 1959.

By the autumn of 1960, an ounce of gold could be exchanged for $40 in the London market even though the official rate in the United States was $35. This price difference was due to price controls on gold in the US which was fixed by the US government in 1933 following the implementation of [[Executive Order 6102]]. In USD terms, the price of gold had not changed in 27 years, this did not allow true price discovery by the free market. This price was fixed following the enactment of E.O. 6102, where the US government purchased gold from US citizens under threat of fines and/or jail time at a rate of $20.67/oz then revalued the gold overnight to $35/oz.

The solution to the Triffin dilemma for the United States was to reduce dollars in circulation by cutting the deficit and raising [[interest rates]] to attract dollars back into the country. Some economists believed both these tactics, however, would drag the U.S. economy into [[recession]].{{cn|date=June 2013}}

In support of the Bretton Woods system and to exert control over the exchange rate of gold, the United States initiated the [[London Gold Pool]] and the General Agreements to Borrow (GAB) in 1961 which sustained the system until 1967, when runs on gold and the devaluation of the [[pound sterling]] were followed by the demise of the system.

===The Balance of Payments dilemma===
In order to maintain the Bretton Woods system, the U.S. had to run a [[balance of payments]] [[current account]] '''deficit''' to provide liquidity for the conversion of gold into U.S. dollars. With more U.S. dollars in the system than were backed with gold under the Bretton Woods agreement, the U.S. dollar was overvalued. This meant that the United States had less gold as foreign governments started converting U.S. dollars to gold and taking it offshore. Foreign speculators were not a direct part of the gold flow out of the US, as under the Bretton Woods Agreement, only governments could exchange US currency for physical gold. Additionally, while the Bretton Woods Agreement was in place, direct speculation by US citizens who were banned from owning any gold other than jewelry following Executive Order 6102 which was enacted in 1933 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt and enabled the US Government to confiscate all gold coinage, gold certificates, and gold bullion held by any citizen, did not contribute to the price imbalance and arbitrage opportunity via a wide disparity of gold prices between the US and other markets. A price ceiling had been enacted which fixed the price of gold at $35/oz USD following the previously mentioned gold confiscation from US citizens in 1933. As with all price controls, this caused supply and demand imbalances and an arbitrage opportunity which rapidly depleted the United States gold reserves. This led to less gold in the country and caused the US Dollar to become more overvalued, leading to a self-propagating cycle. Furthermore, the US had to run a balance of payments current account '''surplus''' to maintain confidence in the U.S. dollar.

As a result, the United States was faced with a dilemma because it is not possible to run a balance of payments current account [[Balance of payments|deficit]] and surplus at the same time.

===The Nixon Shock===
In August 1971, President [[Richard Nixon]] acknowledged the demise of the Bretton Woods system. He announced that the dollar could no longer be exchanged for gold, which soon became known as the [[Nixon shock]].  Although it was announced as a temporary measure, it was to remain in effect. The "gold window" was closed.

==Implication in 2008 meltdown==
&lt;!--TODO: as it stands this is out of context and not very useful to a general reader. The section must first establish context, not just by its section title. Describe the 'meltdown' that is mentioned.--&gt;
In the wake of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], the governor of the [[People's Bank of China]] explicitly named the Triffin Dilemma as the root cause of the economic disorder, in a speech titled ''Reform the International Monetary System''. [[Zhou Xiaochuan]]'s speech of 29 March 2009 proposed strengthening existing global currency controls, through the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This would involve a gradual move away from the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency and towards the use of IMF [[special drawing rights]] (SDRs) as a [[world currency|global reserve currency]].

Zhou argued that part of the reason for the original Bretton Woods system breaking down was the refusal to adopt [[Keynes]]' [[bancor]] which would have been a special international reserve currency to be used instead of the dollar.

American economists such as [[Brad DeLong]] agreed that on almost every point where Keynes was overruled by the Americans during the Bretton Woods negotiations, he was later proved correct by events.&lt;ref&gt;The reason why is simple enough to understand: To maintain the reserve currency status, money-as-debt must be created to maintain international liquidity (provide the money for transactions to take place).  This debt accumulates over time, and eventually becomes large enough that international creditors begin to question whether or not it can ever be paid back.  When that day comes, the status of that currency as a reserve currency is called into question.  Hence the "dilemma" in the name.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhou's proposal attracted much international attention;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; in a November 2009 article published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' magazine, economist [[C.

&lt;/ref&gt; While Zhou's proposal has not yet been adopted, leaders meeting in April at the [[2009 G-20 London summit]] agreed to allow 250 billion SDRs to be created by the IMF, to be distributed to all IMF members according to each country's voting rights.

On April 13, 2010, the Strategy, Policy and Review Department of the IMF published a comprehensive report examining these aforementioned problems as well as other world reserve currency considerations, recommending that the world adopt a global reserve currency (bancor) and that a global central bank be established to administer such a currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In this report, the current issues with having a national global reserve currency are addressed. The merits, difficulties and effectiveness of establishing a multi-currency reserve system are weighed against that of the SDRs, or "basket currency" strategy, and those of establishing this new "global reserve currency". A new multilateral framework and "multi-polar system" for managing capital flows and national debts is also called for, but the IMF cautions that it prefers a gradual shift to this new framework, rather than a sudden change.

(2013 Winter) "[http://bombmagazine.org/article/6931/ulises-carri-n-s-the-poet-s-tongue Ulises Carrión's The Poet's Tongue]" ''BOMB.'' Issue 122. Retrieved 03 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  is widely known for his decisive role in defining and conceptualising the artistic genre artists' book through his manifest ''The New Art of Making Books'' (1975). But his alertness and interest in new forms of art and innovative operations implicated that he was active in most of the artistic fields of his time. The activities cover artworks, theory and independent initiatives. This includes not only a great number of bookworks - as he named artists' books - and unique artworks, but also performances, alongside film, video, and sound works, as well as several edition, publishing, and curating projects, a couple of considerable public projects, and various significant works and initiatives within the international community of mail artists during its most creative period. Equally essential for his artistic career is his engagement in several artists' run spaces. All his artistic activities were reflected by him in highly elaborated theories.&lt;ref name="Schraenen, Guy 1992"&gt;Schraenen, Guy (1992) We have Won! Haven't We?, Exhibition Catalogue, Museum Fodor, Amsterdam, 11-49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Carrión was born in San Andres Tuxtla, Veracruz, Mexico in 1941. After studying philosophy and literature at the National University of Mexico,&lt;ref name="c"&gt;Conwell, Donna. (2002) "[http://www.e-flux.com/projects/do_it/notes/essay/e003_text.html Personal Worlds or Cultural Strategies?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021095128/http://www.e-flux.com/projects/do_it/notes/essay/e003_text.html |date=2015-10-21 }}" ''Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil''. Retrieved 03 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; he started his career as a successful and respected young writer. In 1964 he received a grant for further studies at the Sorbonne Paris, France. Short after he went for studies to the Goethe Institute, Achenmühle, Germany, and to Leeds, England, where he studied English language and literature at the University and graduated with a diploma. In 1972 he definitively settled in Amsterdam, an open and cosmopolitan city with a lot of artistic innovation and international exchanges. Here he became co-founder and member of the ''In-Out Center'' (1972-1975). In 1975, he founded ''Other Books and So'', the first space of its kind devoted to all kind of artists’ publications, which in 1979 became the ''Other Books And So Archive''. He was also the co-founder of the ''Vereniging van Videokunstenaars'', later ''Time Based Arts'' (1983-1993) in Amsterdam, NL. Ulises Carrión died in 1989 in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;Schraenen, Guy (2016) A Story to Remember. In: Dear Reader. Don't Read., Exhibition catalogue, Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Reception==
Due to a certain cult of the overlooked and underestimated(post-)1960s avant-garde, Ulises Carrión has undergone an extraordinary appreciation in a few years. Exhibitions of his works and a flood of references to his artistic strategies and theories in current art works, essays, conferences, as well as newly annotated, listed, translated, and edited works give proof of the widespread reception today.&lt;ref&gt;Aden, Maike (2017): Carrión Carries On. In: Journal of Artists' Books (JAB), No. 40, Fall 2016, 6-12&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread reception of his manifesto ''The New Art of Making Books''&lt;ref&gt;Carrión, Ulises (1975) The New Art of Making Books, Kontexts (Amsterdam), no. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; made him the central reference for the definition of the concept of the artist book. Also his bookshop gallery ''Other Books and So'' became, despite its short duration, a mythologized paragon. In particular in Latin America, Ulises Carrión is received for some time as an important conceptual compatriot.&lt;ref&gt;Aden, Maike (2016) The Posthumous Reception of Ulises Carrión.

[[File:Vector add scale.svg|200px|thumb|right|Vector addition and scalar multiplication: a vector {{math|'''v'''}} (blue) is added to another vector {{math|'''w'''}} (red, upper illustration). Below, '''w''' is stretched by a factor of 2, yielding the sum {{math|'''v''' + 2'''w'''}}.]]

A '''vector space''' (also called a '''linear space''') is a collection of objects called '''vectors''', which may be [[Vector addition|added]] together and [[Scalar multiplication|multiplied]] ("scaled") by numbers, called ''[[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]]''. Scalars are often taken to be [[real number]]s, but there are also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by [[complex number]]s, [[rational number]]s, or generally any [[field (mathematics)|field]]. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called ''[[axiom]]s'', listed [[#Definition|below]].

[[Euclidean vector]]s are an example of a vector space.  They represent [[physics|physical]] quantities such as [[force]]s: any two forces (of the same type) can be added to yield a third, and the multiplication of a [[force vector]] by a real multiplier is another force vector. In the same vein, but in a more [[geometry|geometric]] sense, vectors representing displacements in the plane or in [[three-dimensional space]] also form vector spaces. Vectors in vector spaces do not necessarily have to be arrow-like objects as they appear in the mentioned examples: vectors are regarded as abstract mathematical objects with particular properties, which in some cases can be visualized as arrows.

Vector spaces are the subject of [[linear algebra]] and are well characterized by their [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]], which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in [[mathematical analysis]], as [[function space]]s, whose vectors are [[function (mathematics)|functions]]. These vector spaces are generally endowed with additional structure, which may be a [[topology]], allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and [[continuous function|continuity]]. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] or [[inner product]] are more commonly used, as having a notion of [[metric (mathematics)|distance]] between two vectors. This is particularly the case of [[Banach space]]s and [[Hilbert space]]s, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.

Historically, the first ideas leading to vector spaces can be traced back as far as the 17th century's [[analytic geometry]], [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], systems of [[linear equation]]s, and Euclidean vectors. The modern, more abstract treatment, first formulated by [[Giuseppe Peano]] in 1888, encompasses more general objects than [[Euclidean space]], but much of the theory can be seen as an extension of classical geometric ideas like [[line (geometry)|line]]s, [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s and their higher-dimensional analogs.

Today, vector spaces are applied throughout [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[engineering]]. They are the appropriate linear-algebraic notion to deal with [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]]. They offer a framework for [[Fourier series|Fourier expansion]], which is employed in [[image compression]] routines, and they provide an environment that can be used for solution techniques for [[partial differential equation]]s. Furthermore, vector spaces furnish an abstract, [[coordinate-free]] way of dealing with geometrical and physical objects such as [[tensor]]s. This in turn allows the examination of local properties of [[manifold (mathematics)|manifolds]] by linearization techniques. Vector spaces may be generalized in several ways, leading to more advanced notions in geometry and [[abstract algebra]].

{{Algebraic structures |Module}}

== Introduction and definition ==
The concept of vector space will first be explained by describing two particular examples:

===First example: arrows in the plane===
The first example of a vector space consists of [[arrow]]s in a fixed [[plane (geometry)|plane]], starting at one fixed point. This is used in physics to describe [[force]]s or [[velocity|velocities]]. Given any two such arrows, {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}}, the [[parallelogram]] spanned by these two arrows contains one diagonal arrow that starts at the origin, too. This new arrow is called the ''sum'' of the two arrows and is denoted {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}}. In the special case of two arrows on the same line, their sum is the arrow on this line whose length is the sum or the difference of the lengths, depending on whether the arrows have the same direction. Another operation that can be done with arrows is scaling: given any positive [[real number]] {{math|''a''}}, the arrow that has the same direction as {{math|'''v'''}}, but is dilated or shrunk by multiplying its length by {{math|''a''}}, is called ''multiplication'' of {{math|'''v'''}} by {{math|''a''}}. It is denoted {{math|''a'''''v'''}}. When {{math|''a''}} is negative, {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is defined as the arrow pointing in the opposite direction, instead.

The following shows a few examples: if {{math|1=''a'' = 2}}, the resulting vector {{math|''a'''''w'''}} has the same direction as {{math|'''w'''}}, but is stretched to the double length of {{math|'''w'''}} (right image below). Equivalently, {{math|2'''w'''}} is the sum {{math|'''w''' + '''w'''}}. Moreover, {{math|1=(−1)'''v''' = −'''v'''}} has the opposite direction and the same length as {{math|'''v'''}} (blue vector pointing down in the right image).

|width=50%|[[File:Scalar multiplication.svg|230px|Scalar multiplication: the multiples {{math|−'''v'''}} and {{math|2'''w'''}} are shown.]]
|}

===Second example: ordered pairs of numbers===
A second key example of a vector space is provided by pairs of real numbers {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}. (The order of the components {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} is significant, so such a pair is also called an [[ordered pair]].) Such a pair is written as {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}. The sum of two such pairs and multiplication of a pair with a number is defined as follows:
:{{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} + {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}} {{math|1== (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}
and 
:{{math|1=''a''&amp;thinsp;(''x'', ''y'') = (''ax'', ''ay'')}}.

The first example above reduces to this one if the arrows are represented by the pair of [[Cartesian coordinates]] of their end points.

===Definition===
In this article, vectors are represented in boldface to distinguish them from scalars.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;It is also common, especially in physics, to denote vectors with an arrow on top: {{math|{{vec|''v''}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A vector space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}} is a [[set (mathematics)|set]]&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} together with two operations that satisfy the eight axioms listed below.

* The first operation, called '''vector addition''' or simply '''addition''' {{math| + : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}, takes any two vectors&amp;nbsp;{{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} and assigns to them a third vector which is commonly written as {{math|'''v''' + '''w'''}}, and called the sum of these two vectors. (Note that the resultant vector is also an element of the set {{mvar|V}} ). 
* The second operation, called '''[[scalar multiplication]]''' {{math| · : ''F'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}， takes any scalar&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|a}} and any vector&amp;nbsp;{{math|'''v'''}} and gives another vector&amp;nbsp;{{math|''a'''''v'''}}. (Similarly, the vector {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is an element of the set {{mvar|V}} ).

Elements of {{mvar|V}} are commonly called ''vectors''. Elements of&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|F}} are commonly called ''scalars''.

In the two examples above, the field is the field of the real numbers and the set of the vectors consists of the planar arrows with fixed starting point and of pairs of real numbers, respectively.

To qualify as a vector space, the set&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} and the operations of addition and multiplication must adhere to a number of requirements called [[axiom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the list below, let {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''w'''}} be arbitrary vectors in {{mvar|V}}, and {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} scalars in {{mvar|F}}.

{| border="0" style="width:100%;" class="wikitable"
|-
! Axiom || Meaning
|-
| [[Associativity]] of addition || {{math|1='''u''' + ('''v''' + '''w''') = ('''u''' + '''v''') + '''w'''}}
|- style="background:#F8F4FF;"
| [[Commutativity]] of addition || {{math|1='''u''' + '''v''' = '''v''' + '''u'''}}
|-
| [[Identity element]] of addition || There exists an element {{math|'''0''' ∈ ''V''}}, called the ''[[zero vector]]'', such that {{math|1='''v''' + '''0''' = '''v'''}} for all {{math|'''v''' ∈ ''V''}}.
|- style="background:#F8F4FF;"
| [[Inverse element]]s of addition || For every {{math|'''v''' ∈ ''V''}}, there exists an element {{math|−'''v''' ∈ ''V''}}, called the ''[[additive inverse]]'' of {{math|'''v'''}}, such that {{math|1='''v''' + (−'''v''') = '''0'''}}.
|-
| [[Semigroup action|Compatibility]] of scalar multiplication with field multiplication || {{math|1=''a''(''b'''''v''') = (''ab'')'''v'''}} &lt;ref group=nb&gt;This axiom and the next refer to two different operations: scalar multiplication: {{math|''b'''''v'''}}; and field multiplication: {{math|''ab''}}. They do not assert the associativity of either operation. More formally, scalar multiplication is a [[monoid action]] of the multiplicative monoid of the field {{mvar|F}} on the vector space {{mvar|V}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
|- style="background:#F8F4FF;"
| Identity element of scalar multiplication ||  {{math|1=1'''v''' = '''v'''}}, where {{math|1}} denotes the [[multiplicative identity]] in {{mvar|F}}.
|-
| [[Distributivity]] of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;|| {{math|1=''a''('''u''' + '''v''') = ''a'''''u''' + ''a'''''v'''}}
|- style="background:#F8F4FF;"
| Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition || {{math|1=(''a'' + ''b'')'''v''' = ''a'''''v''' + ''b'''''v'''}}
|}

These axioms generalize properties of the vectors introduced in the above examples. Indeed, the result of addition of two ordered pairs (as in the second example above) does not depend on the order of the summands:
:{{math|1=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''w'''&lt;/sub&gt;) + (''x''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;'''v'''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.
Likewise, in the geometric example of vectors as arrows, {{math|1='''v''' + '''w''' = '''w''' + '''v'''}} since the parallelogram defining the sum of the vectors is independent of the order of the vectors. All other axioms can be checked in a similar manner in both examples. Thus, by disregarding the concrete nature of the particular type of vectors, the definition incorporates these two and many more examples in one notion of vector space.

Subtraction of two vectors and division by a (non-zero) scalar can be defined as
:{{math|1='''v''' − '''w''' = '''v''' + (−'''w''')}},
:{{math|1='''v'''/''a'' = (1/''a'')'''v'''}}.

When the scalar field {{mvar|F}} is the [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, the vector space is called a ''real vector space''. When the scalar field is the [[complex number]]s {{math|'''C'''}}, the vector space is called a ''complex vector space''. These two cases are the ones used most often in engineering. The general definition of a vector space allows scalars to be elements of any fixed [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{mvar|F}}. The notion is then known as an {{mvar|F}}-''vector spaces'' or a ''vector space over {{mvar|F}}''. A field is, essentially, a set of numbers possessing [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]] and [[division (mathematics)|division]] operations.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some authors (such as {{Harvard citations|last = Brown|year = 1991|nb=yes}}) restrict attention to the fields {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}, but most of the theory is unchanged for an arbitrary field.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[rational number]]s form a field.

In contrast to the intuition stemming from vectors in the plane and higher-dimensional cases, there is, in general vector spaces, no notion of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]], [[angle]]s or [[distance]]s. To deal with such matters, particular types of vector spaces are introduced; see [[#Vector spaces with additional structure|below]].

===Alternative formulations and elementary consequences===
Vector addition and scalar multiplication are operations, satisfying the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] property:  {{math|'''u''' + '''v'''}} and {{math|''a'''''v'''}} are in {{math|''V''}} for all {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''F''}}, and {{math|'''u'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} in {{math|''V''}}. Some older sources mention these properties as separate axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = van der Waerden|year = 1993|nb = yes|loc=Ch. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the parlance of [[abstract algebra]], the first four axioms are equivalent to requiring the set of vectors to be an [[abelian group]] under addition. The remaining axioms give this group an {{math|''F''}}-[[Module (mathematics)|module]] structure. In other words, there is a [[ring homomorphism]] {{math|''f''}} from the field {{math|''F''}} into the [[endomorphism ring]] of the group of vectors. Then scalar multiplication {{math|''a'''''v'''}} is defined as {{math|(''f''(''a''))('''v''')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last=Bourbaki|year=1998|nb=yes|loc=§II.1.1}}. Bourbaki calls the group homomorphisms {{math|''f''(''a'')}} ''homotheties''.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of direct consequences of the vector space axioms. Some of them derive from [[elementary group theory]], applied to the additive group of vectors: for example, the zero vector {{math|'''0'''}} of {{math|''V''}} and the additive inverse {{math|−'''v'''}} of any vector {{math|'''v'''}} are unique. Further properties follow by employing also the distributive law for the scalar multiplication, for example {{math|''a'''''v'''}} equals {{math|'''0'''}} if and only if {{math|''a''}} equals {{math|0}} or {{math|'''v'''}} equals {{math|'''0'''}}.

==History==
Vector spaces stem from [[affine geometry]] via the introduction of [[coordinate]]s in the plane or three-dimensional space. Around 1636, [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] founded [[analytic geometry]] by equating solutions to an equation of two variables with points on a plane [[curve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1969|nb = yes|loc = ch. "Algèbre linéaire et algèbre multilinéaire", pp. 78–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804, to achieve geometric solutions without using coordinates, [[Bernard Bolzano|Bolzano]] introduced certain operations on points, lines and planes, which are predecessors of vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bolzano|year = 1804|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work was then used in the conception of [[Barycentric coordinate system (mathematics)|barycentric coordinates]] by [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]] in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Möbius|year = 1827|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1828 [[C. V. Mourey]] suggested the existence of an algebra surpassing not only ordinary algebra but also two-dimensional algebra created by him searching a geometrical interpretation of complex numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A History of Vector Analysis: The Evolution of the Idea of a Vectorial System |last1=Crowe |first1=Michel J. |year=1994 |publisher=Dover |isbn= 0-486-67910-1 |page=11 and 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of vectors was founded on [[Giusto Bellavitis|Bellavitis]]' notion of the bipoint, an oriented segment of which one end is the origin and the other a target, then further elaborated with the presentation of [[complex number]]s by [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]] and [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] and the introduction of [[quaternion]]s and [[biquaternion]]s by the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Hamilton|year = 1853|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are elements in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;}}; their treatment as [[linear combination]]s can be traced back to [[Edmond Laguerre|Laguerre]] in 1867, who also defined [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]].

In 1857, [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] introduced [[matrix notation]], which allows for a harmonization and simplification of [[linear map]]s. Around the same time, [[Hermann Grassmann|Grassmann]] studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects endowed with operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Grassmann|year = 1844|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, the concepts of [[linear independence]] and [[dimension]], as well as [[scalar product]]s, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work extended a vector space of ''n'' dimensions to one of 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; dimensions by consideration of 2-vectors &lt;math&gt;u \wedge v&lt;/math&gt; and 3-vectors &lt;math&gt;u \wedge v \wedge w&lt;/math&gt; called [[multivector]]s. This extension, called [[multilinear algebra]], is governed by the rules of [[exterior algebra]]. [[Giuseppe Peano|Peano]] was the first to give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Peano|year = 1888|nb = yes |loc = ch. IX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important development of vector spaces is due to the construction of [[function space]]s by [[Henri Lebesgue|Lebesgue]]. This was later formalized by [[Stefan Banach|Banach]] and [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], around 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Banach|year = 1922|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, [[algebra]] and the new field of [[functional analysis]] began to interact, notably with key concepts such as [[Lp space|spaces of ''p''-integrable functions]] and [[Hilbert space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Dorier|year = 1995|nb = yes}}, {{Harvard citations|last = Moore|year = 1995|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vector spaces, including infinite-dimensional ones, then became a firmly established notion, and many mathematical branches started making use of this concept.

== Examples ==
{{main|Examples of vector spaces}}

===Coordinate spaces===
{{Main|Coordinate space}}
The simplest example of a vector space over a field {{math|''F''}} is the field itself, equipped with its standard addition and multiplication. More generally, a vector space can be composed of
[[tuple|''n''-tuples]] (sequences of length {{math|''n''}}) of elements of {{math|''F''}}, such as
:{{math|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where each {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is an element of {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. I.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A vector space composed of all the {{math|''n''}}-tuples of a field {{math|''F''}} is known as a ''[[coordinate space]]'', usually denoted {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The case {{math|1=''n'' = 1}} is the above-mentioned simplest example, in which the field {{math|''F''}} is also regarded as a vector space over itself. The case {{math|1=''F'' = '''R'''}} and {{math|1=''n'' = 2}} was discussed in the introduction above.

===Complex numbers and other field extensions===
The set of [[complex numbers]] {{math|'''C'''}}, i.e., numbers that can be written in the form {{math|1=''x'' + ''iy''}} for [[real numbers]] {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} where {{math|''i''}} is the [[imaginary unit]], form a vector space over the reals with the usual addition and multiplication: {{math|1=(''x'' + ''iy'') + (''a'' + ''ib'') = (''x'' + ''a'') + ''i''(''y'' + ''b'')}} and {{math|1=''c'' ⋅ (''x'' + ''iy'') = (''c'' ⋅ ''x'') + ''i''(''c'' ⋅ ''y'')}} for real numbers {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}.  The various axioms of a vector space follow from the fact that the same rules hold for complex number arithmetic.

In fact, the example of complex numbers is essentially the same (i.e., it is ''isomorphic'') to the vector space of ordered pairs of real numbers mentioned above: if we think of the complex number {{math|''x'' + ''i'' ''y''}} as representing the ordered pair {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} in the [[complex plane]] then we see that the rules for sum and scalar product correspond exactly to those in the earlier example.

More generally, [[field extension]]s provide another class of examples of vector spaces, particularly in algebra and [[algebraic number theory]]: a field {{math|''F''}} containing a [[Field extension|smaller field]] {{math|''E''}} is an {{math|''E''}}-vector space, by the given multiplication and addition operations of {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year =2002|loc = ch. V.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the complex numbers are a vector space over {{math|'''R'''}}, and the field extension &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}(i\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}}.  &lt;!--A particularly interesting type of field extension in [[number theory]] is {{math|'''Q'''(''α'')}}, the extension of the rational numbers {{math|'''Q'''}} by a fixed complex number {{math|''α''}}. {{math|'''Q'''(''α'')}} is the smallest field containing the rationals and a fixed complex number ''α''. Its dimension as a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}} depends on the choice of {{math|''α''}}.--&gt;

===Function spaces===
{{Main|Function space}}
Functions from any fixed set {{math|Ω}} to a field {{math|''F''}} also form vector spaces, by performing addition and scalar multiplication pointwise. That is, the sum of two functions {{math|''f''}} and {{math|''g''}} is the function {{math|(''f'' + ''g'')}} given by
:{{math|1=(''f'' + ''g'')(''w'') = ''f''(''w'') + ''g''(''w'')}},
and similarly for multiplication. Such function spaces occur in many geometric situations, when {{math|Ω}} is the [[real line]] or an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]], or other [[subset]]s of {{math|'''R'''}}. Many notions in topology and analysis, such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[integral|integrability]] or [[differentiability]] are well-behaved with respect to linearity: sums and scalar multiples of functions possessing such a property still have that property.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = ch. XII.3., p. 335|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, the set of such functions are vector spaces. They are studied in greater detail using the methods of [[functional analysis]], see [[#labelFunctionalAnalysis|below]]. Algebraic constraints also yield vector spaces: the &lt;cite id=labelPolynomialRing&gt;[[polynomial ring|vector space {{math|''F''[x]}}]]&lt;/cite&gt; is given by [[polynomial function]]s:
:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ... + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where the [[coefficient]]s {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are in {{math|''F''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. IX.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear equations===
{{Main|Linear equation|Linear differential equation|Systems of linear equations}}
Systems of [[homogeneous linear equation]]s are closely tied to vector spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|loc = ch. VI.3.|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the solutions of 
:{|
|-
| style="text-align:right;"|{{math|''a''}}
|{{math|+}}
|{{math|3''b''}}
|{{math|+}}
| style="text-align:right;"|{{math|''c''}}
|{{math|{{=}} 0}}
|-
|{{math|4''a''}}
|{{math|+}}
|{{math|2''b''}}
|{{math|+}}
|{{math|2''c''}}
|{{math|{{=}} 0}}
|}
are given by triples with arbitrary {{math|''a''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''a''/2}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = −5''a''/2}}. They form a vector space: sums and scalar multiples of such triples still satisfy the same ratios of the three variables; thus they are solutions, too. [[matrix (mathematics)|Matrices]] can be used to condense multiple linear equations as above into one vector equation, namely
:&lt;cite id=equation3&gt;{{math|1=''A'''''x''' = '''0'''}}&lt;/cite&gt;,
where {{math|1=''A'' =}} &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \\
4 &amp; 2 &amp; 2\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix containing the coefficients of the given equations, {{math|'''x'''}} is the vector {{math|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}}, {{math|''A'''''x'''}} denotes the [[matrix product]], and {{math|1='''0''' = (0, 0)}} is the zero vector. In a similar vein, the solutions of homogeneous ''linear differential equations'' form vector spaces. For example,
:&lt;cite id=equation1&gt;{{math|1=''f''′′(''x'') + 2''f''′(''x'') + ''f''(''x'') = 0}}&lt;/cite&gt;
yields {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''a&amp;thinsp;e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx&amp;thinsp;e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, where {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are arbitrary constants, and {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the [[natural exponential function]].

== Basis and dimension ==
{{Main|basis (linear algebra)|l1=Basis|dimension (linear algebra)|l2=Dimension}}
[[File:Vector components and base change.svg|A vector {{math|'''v'''}} in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} (blue) expressed in terms of different bases: using the [[standard basis]] of {{math|1='''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; '''v''' = ''x'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''y'''''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (black), and using a different, non-[[orthogonal vector|orthogonal]] basis: {{math|1='''v''' = '''f'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''f'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} (red).|thumb|200px]]
&lt;cite id=label1&gt;''Bases''&lt;/cite&gt; allow one to represent vectors by a [[sequence]] of scalars called ''coordinates'' or ''components''. A basis is a (finite or infinite) set {{math|1=''B'' = {'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ ''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of vectors {{math|'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, for convenience often indexed by some [[index set]] {{math|''I''}}, that spans the whole space and is [[linearly independent]]. "Spanning the whole space" means that any vector {{math|'''v'''}} can be expressed as a finite sum (called a ''[[linear combination]]'') of the basis elements:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = a_1 \mathbf{b}_{i_1} + a_2 \mathbf{b}_{i_2} + \cdots + a_n \mathbf{b}_{i_n},&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationNote|1}}}}
where the {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are scalars, called the coordinates (or the components) of the vector {{math|'''v'''}} with respect to the basis {{math|''B''}}, and {{math|'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;}} {{math|1=(''k'' = 1, ..., ''n'')}} elements of {{math|''B''}}. Linear independence means that the coordinates {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are uniquely determined for any vector in the vector space.

For example, the [[coordinate vector]]s {{math|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (1, 0, ..., 0)}}, {{math|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 1, 0, ..., 0)}}, to {{math|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = (0, 0, ..., 0, 1)}}, form a basis of {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, called the [[standard basis]], since any vector {{math|(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these vectors:
:{{math|1=(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(1, 0, ..., 0) + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(0, 1, 0, ..., 0) + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(0, ..., 0, 1) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
The corresponding coordinates {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|...}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} are just the [[Cartesian coordinates]] of the vector.

Every vector space has a basis. This follows from [[Zorn's lemma]], an equivalent formulation of the [[Axiom of Choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 1.9, p. 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the other axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the existence of bases is equivalent to the axiom of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Blass|year = 1984|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ultrafilter lemma]], which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or [[cardinality]] (cf. ''[[Dimension theorem for vector spaces]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Halpern|year = 1966|nb = yes|loc=pp. 670–673}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is called the ''dimension'' of the vector space, denoted by dim ''V''. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Artin|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 3.3.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimension of the coordinate space {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is {{math|''n''}}, by the basis exhibited above. The dimension of the polynomial ring ''F''[''x''] introduced [[#labelPolynomialRing|above]] is [[countably infinite]], a basis is given by {{math|1}}, {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, {{math|...}} [[A fortiori]], the dimension of more general function spaces, such as the space of functions on some (bounded or unbounded) interval, is infinite.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The [[indicator function]]s of intervals (of which there are infinitely many) are linearly independent, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; Under suitable regularity assumptions on the coefficients involved, the dimension of the solution space of a homogeneous [[ordinary differential equation]] equals the degree of the equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Braun|year = 1993|nb = yes|loc=Th. 3.4.5, p. 291}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the solution space for the [[#equation1|above equation]] is generated by {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''xe''&lt;sup&gt;−''x''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. These two functions are linearly independent over {{math|'''R'''}}, so the dimension of this space is two, as is the degree of the equation.

A field extension over the rationals {{math|'''Q'''}} can be thought of as a vector space over {{math|'''Q'''}} (by defining vector addition as field addition, defining scalar multiplication as field multiplication by elements of {{math|'''Q'''}}, and otherwise ignoring the field multiplication). The dimension (or [[degree of a field extension|degree]]) of the field extension {{math|'''Q'''(α)}} over {{math|'''Q'''}} depends on {{math|α}}. If {{math|α}} satisfies some polynomial equation
&lt;math display=block&gt; q_n \alpha^n + q_{n - 1} \alpha^{n - 1} + \ldots + q_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
with rational coefficients {{math|''q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''q''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} (in other words, if α is [[algebraic number|algebraic]]), the dimension is finite. More precisely, it equals the degree of the [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] having α as a [[root of a function|root]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Stewart|year = 1975|nb = yes|loc=Proposition 4.3, p. 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the complex numbers '''C''' are a two-dimensional real vector space, generated by 1 and the [[imaginary unit]] ''i''. The latter satisfies ''i''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = 0, an equation of degree two. Thus, '''C''' is a two-dimensional '''R'''-vector space (and, as any field, one-dimensional as a vector space over itself, '''C'''). If α is not algebraic, the dimension of '''Q'''(α) over '''Q''' is infinite. For instance, for α = [[pi|π]] there is no such equation, in other words π is [[transcendental number|transcendental]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Stewart|year = 1975|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 6.5, p. 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linear maps and matrices==
{{Main|Linear map}}
The relation of two vector spaces can be expressed by ''linear map'' or ''linear transformation''. They are [[function (mathematics)|functions]] that reflect the vector space structure—i.e., they preserve sums and scalar multiplication:
:''f''('''x''' + '''y''') = ''f''('''x''') + ''f''('''y''') and ''f''(''a'' &amp;middot; '''x''') = ''a'' &amp;middot; ''f''('''x''') for all '''x''' and '''y''' in ''V'', all ''a'' in ''F''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[isomorphism]]'' is a linear map {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} such that there exists an [[inverse map]] {{math|''g'' : ''W'' → ''V''}}, which is a map such that the two possible [[function composition|compositions]] {{math|''f'' ∘ ''g'' : ''W'' → ''W''}} and {{math|''g'' ∘ ''f'' : ''V'' → ''V''}} are [[Identity function|identity maps]]. Equivalently, ''f'' is both one-to-one ([[injective]]) and onto ([[surjective]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IV.4, Corollary, p. 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If there exists an isomorphism between ''V'' and ''W'', the two spaces are said to be ''isomorphic''; they are then essentially identical as vector spaces, since all identities holding in ''V'' are, via ''f'', transported to similar ones in ''W'', and vice versa via ''g''.

[[File:Vector components.svg|180px|right|thumb|Describing an arrow vector '''v''' by its coordinates ''x'' and ''y'' yields an isomorphism of vector spaces.]]
For example, the "arrows in the plane" and "ordered pairs of numbers" vector spaces in the introduction are isomorphic: a planar arrow '''v''' departing at the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] of some (fixed) [[coordinate system]] can be expressed as an ordered pair by considering the ''x''- and ''y''-component of the arrow, as shown in the image at the right. Conversely, given a pair (''x'', ''y''), the arrow going by ''x'' to the right (or to the left, if ''x'' is negative), and ''y'' up (down, if ''y'' is negative) turns back the arrow '''v'''.

Linear maps ''V'' → ''W'' between two vector spaces form a vector space Hom&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt;(''V'', ''W''), also denoted L(''V'', ''W'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Example IV.2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space of linear maps from ''V'' to ''F'' is called the ''[[dual vector space]]'', denoted ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. VI.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Via the injective [[natural (category theory)|natural]] map {{math|''V'' → ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}, any vector space can be embedded into its ''bidual''; the map is an isomorphism if and only if the space is finite-dimensional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Halmos|year =1974|nb = yes|loc=p. 28, Ex. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a basis of {{math|''V''}} is chosen, linear maps {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} are completely determined by specifying the images of the basis vectors, because any element of ''V'' is expressed uniquely as a linear combination of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Theorem IV.2.1, p. 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|1=dim ''V'' = dim ''W''}}, a [[bijection|1-to-1 correspondence]] between fixed bases of {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} gives rise to a linear map that maps any basis element of {{math|''V''}} to the corresponding basis element of {{math|''W''}}. It is an isomorphism, by its very definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Th. 2.5 and 2.6, p. 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, two vector spaces are isomorphic if their dimensions agree and vice versa. Another way to express this is that any vector space is ''completely classified'' ([[up to]] isomorphism) by its dimension, a single number. In particular, any ''n''-dimensional {{math|''F''}}-vector space {{math|''V''}} is isomorphic to {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. There is, however, no "canonical" or preferred isomorphism; actually an isomorphism {{math|''φ'' : ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''V''}} is equivalent to the choice of a basis of {{math|''V''}}, by mapping the standard basis of {{math|''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|''V''}}, via {{math|''φ''}}. The freedom of choosing a convenient basis is particularly useful in the infinite-dimensional context; see [[#basis in inf dim context|below]].

===Matrices===
{{Main|Matrix (mathematics)|l1=Matrix|Determinant}}
[[Image:Matrix.svg|right|thumb|200px|A typical matrix]]
''Matrices'' are a useful notion to encode linear maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. V.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are written as a rectangular array of scalars as in the image at the right. Any ''m''-by-''n'' matrix ''A'' gives rise to a linear map from ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, by the following
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) \mapsto \left(\sum_{j=1}^n a_{1j}x_j, \sum_{j=1}^n a_{2j}x_j, \cdots, \sum_{j=1}^n a_{mj}x_j \right)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\sum&lt;/math&gt; denotes [[summation]],
or, using the [[matrix multiplication]] of the matrix {{math|''A''}} with the coordinate vector {{math|'''x'''}}:
:&lt;cite id=equation2&gt;{{math|'''x''' ↦ ''A'''''x'''}}&lt;/cite&gt;.
Moreover, after choosing bases of {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}}, ''any'' linear map {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} is uniquely represented by a matrix via this assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. V.3., Corollary, p. 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Determinant parallelepiped.svg|200px|right|thumb|The volume of this [[parallelepiped]] is the absolute value of the determinant of the 3-by-3 matrix formed by the vectors {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.]]
The [[determinant]] {{math|det (''A'')}} of a [[square matrix]] {{math|''A''}} is a scalar that tells whether the associated map is an isomorphism or not: to be so it is sufficient and necessary that the determinant is nonzero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=Theorem VII.9.8, p. 198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The linear transformation of {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} corresponding to a real ''n''-by-''n'' matrix is [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation preserving]] if and only if its determinant is positive.

===Eigenvalues and eigenvectors===
{{Main|Eigenvalues and eigenvectors}}
[[Endomorphism]]s, linear maps {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''V''}}, are particularly important since in this case vectors {{math|'''v'''}} can be compared with their image under {{math|''f''}}, {{math|''f''('''v''')}}. Any nonzero vector {{math|'''v'''}} satisfying {{math|1=''λ'''''v''' = ''f''('''v''')}}, where {{math|''λ''}} is a scalar, is called an ''eigenvector'' of {{math|''f''}} with ''eigenvalue'' {{math|''λ''}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The nomenclature derives from [[German language|German]] "[[wikt:eigen|eigen]]", which means own or proper.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 8, p. 135–156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equivalently, {{math|'''v'''}} is an element of the [[Kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] of the difference {{math|''f'' − ''λ'' · Id}} (where Id is the [[identity function|identity map]] {{math|''V'' → ''V'')}}. If {{math|''V''}} is finite-dimensional, this can be rephrased using determinants: {{math|''f''}} having eigenvalue {{math|''λ''}} is equivalent to
:{{math|1=det(''f'' − ''λ'' · Id) = 0}}.
By spelling out the definition of the determinant, the expression on the left hand side can be seen to be a polynomial function in {{math|''λ''}}, called the [[characteristic polynomial]] of {{math|''f''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IX.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the field {{math|''F''}} is large enough to contain a zero of this polynomial (which automatically happens for {{math|''F''}} [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], such as {{math|1=''F'' = '''C'''}}) any linear map has at least one eigenvector. The vector space {{math|''V''}} may or may not possess an [[eigenbasis]], a basis consisting of eigenvectors. This phenomenon is governed by the [[Jordan canonical form]] of the map.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 8, p. 140}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = nb&gt; See also [[Jordan–Chevalley decomposition]].&lt;/ref&gt; The set of all eigenvectors corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of {{math|''f''}} forms a vector space known as the ''eigenspace'' corresponding to the eigenvalue (and {{math|''f''}}) in question. To achieve the [[spectral theorem]], the corresponding statement in the infinite-dimensional case, the machinery of functional analysis is needed, see [[#labelSpectralTheorem|below]].

==Basic constructions==
In addition to the above concrete examples, there are a number of standard linear algebraic constructions that yield vector spaces related to given ones. In addition to the definitions given below, they are also characterized by [[universal property|universal properties]], which determine an object {{math|''X''}} by specifying the linear maps from {{math|''X''}} to any other vector space.

===Subspaces and quotient spaces===
{{Main|Linear subspace|Quotient vector space}}
[[File:Linear subspaces with shading.svg|thumb|250px|right|A line passing through the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] (blue, thick) in [[Euclidean space|{{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}]] is a linear subspace. It is the intersection of two [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] (green and yellow).]]

A nonempty [[subset]] ''W'' of a vector space ''V'' that is closed under addition and scalar multiplication (and therefore contains the '''0'''-vector of ''V'') is called a ''linear subspace'' of ''V'', or simply a ''subspace'' of ''V'', when the ambient space is unambiguously a vector space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This is typically the case when a vector space is also considered as an [[affine space]]. In this case, a linear subspace contains the [[zero vector]], while an affine subspace does not necessarily contain it.&lt;/ref&gt; Subspaces of ''V'' are vector spaces (over the same field) in their own right. The intersection of all subspaces containing a given set ''S'' of vectors is called its [[linear span|span]], and it is the smallest subspace of ''V'' containing the set ''S''. Expressed in terms of elements, the span is the subspace consisting of all the [[linear combination]]s of elements of ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, p. 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|vector line|vector plane|vector hyperplane}}A linear subspace of dimension 1 is a '''vector line'''.  A linear subspace of dimension 2 is a '''vector plane'''. A linear subspace that contains all elements but one of a basis of the ambient space is a '''vector hyperplane'''. In a vector space of finite dimension {{math|''n''}}, a vector hyperplane is thus a subspace of dimension {{math|''n'' – 1}}.

The counterpart to subspaces are ''quotient vector spaces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 3, p. 64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given any subspace {{math|''W'' ⊂ ''V''}}, the quotient space ''V''/''W'' ("''V'' [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''W''") is defined as follows: as a set, it consists of {{math|1='''v''' + ''W'' = {'''v''' + '''w''' : '''w''' ∈ ''W''},}} where '''v''' is an arbitrary vector in ''V''. The sum of two such elements {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''}} and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''}} is {{math|('''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + ''W'',}} and scalar multiplication is given by {{math|1=''a'' · ('''v''' + ''W'') = (''a'' · '''v''') + ''W''}}. The key point in this definition is that {{math|1='''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W'' = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''W''}} [[if and only if]] the difference of '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; lies in ''W''.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Some authors (such as {{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes}}) choose to start with this [[equivalence relation]] and derive the concrete shape of ''V''/''W'' from this.&lt;/ref&gt; This way, the quotient space "forgets" information that is contained in the subspace ''W''.

The [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] ker(''f'') of a linear map {{math|''f'' : ''V'' → ''W''}} consists of vectors '''v''' that are mapped to '''0''' in ''W''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1987|nb = yes|loc=ch. IV.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both kernel and [[image (mathematics)|image]] {{math|1=im(''f'') = {''f''('''v''') : '''v''' ∈ ''V''} }} are subspaces of ''V'' and ''W'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of kernels and images is part of the statement that the [[category of vector spaces]] (over a fixed field ''F'') is an [[abelian category]], i.e. a corpus of mathematical objects and structure-preserving maps between them (a [[category (mathematics)|category]]) that behaves much like the [[category of abelian groups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Mac Lane|year = 1998|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, many statements such as the [[first isomorphism theorem]] (also called [[rank–nullity theorem]] in matrix-related terms)
:''V'' / ker(''f'') ≡ im(''f'').
and the second and third isomorphism theorem can be formulated and proven in a way very similar to the corresponding statements for [[group (mathematics)|groups]].

An important example is the kernel of a linear map {{math|'''x''' ↦ ''A'''''x'''}} for some fixed matrix ''A'', as [[#equation2|above]]. The kernel of this map is the subspace of vectors '''x''' such that {{math|1=''A'''''x''' = 0}}, which is precisely the set of solutions to the system of homogeneous linear equations belonging to ''A''. This concept also extends to linear differential equations
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 f + a_1 \frac{d f}{d x} + a_2 \frac{d^2 f}{d x^2} + \cdots + a_n \frac{d^n f}{d x^n} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where the coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are functions in ''x'', too.
In the corresponding map
:&lt;math&gt;f \mapsto D(f) = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i \frac{d^i f}{d x^i}&lt;/math&gt;,
the [[derivative]]s of the function ''f'' appear linearly (as opposed to ''f''′′(''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, for example). Since differentiation is a linear procedure (i.e., {{math|1=(''f'' + ''g'')′ = ''f''′ + ''g''&amp;thinsp;′}} and {{math|1=(''c''·''f'')′ = ''c''·''f''′}} for a constant {{math|''c''}}) this assignment is linear, called a [[linear differential operator]]. In particular, the solutions to the differential equation {{math|1=''D''(''f'') = 0}} form a vector space (over {{math|'''R'''}} or {{math|'''C'''}}).

===Direct product and direct sum===
{{Main|Direct product|Direct sum of modules}}
The ''direct product'' of vector spaces and the ''direct sum'' of vector spaces are two ways of combining an indexed family of vector spaces into a new vector space.

The ''direct product''&lt;!--explain direct--&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\prod_{i \in I} V_i}&lt;/math&gt; of a family of vector spaces ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; consists of the set of all tuples ({{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i'' ∈ ''I''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, which specify for each index ''i'' in some [[index set]] ''I'' an element '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1, pp. 31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Addition and scalar multiplication is performed componentwise. A variant of this construction is the ''direct sum'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus_{i \in I} V_i&lt;/math&gt; (also called [[coproduct]] and denoted &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\coprod_{i \in I}V_i}&lt;/math&gt;), where only tuples with finitely many nonzero vectors are allowed. If the index set ''I'' is finite, the two constructions agree, but in general they are different.

===Tensor product===
{{Main|Tensor product of vector spaces}}
The ''tensor product'' {{math|''V'' ⊗&lt;sub&gt;''F''&lt;/sub&gt; ''W''}}, or simply {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}}, of two vector spaces ''V'' and ''W'' is one of the central notions of [[multilinear algebra]] which deals with extending notions such as linear maps to several variables. A map {{math|''g'' : [[Cartesian product|''V'' × ''W'']] → ''X''}} is called [[bilinear map|bilinear]] if ''g'' is linear in both variables '''v''' and '''w'''.  That is to say, for fixed '''w''' the map {{math|'''v''' ↦ ''g''('''v''', '''w''')}} is linear in the sense above and likewise for fixed '''v'''.

The tensor product is a particular vector space that is a ''universal'' recipient of bilinear maps ''g'', as follows. It is defined as the vector space consisting of finite (formal) sums of symbols called [[tensor]]s
:'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,
subject to the rules 
: ''a'' &amp;middot; ('''v''' ⊗ '''w''') = (''a'' &amp;middot; '''v''') ⊗ '''w''' = '''v''' ⊗ (''a'' &amp;middot; '''w'''), where ''a'' is a scalar,
:('''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊗ '''w''' = '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w''' + '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''w''', and
:'''v''' ⊗ ('''w'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = '''v''' ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + '''v''' ⊗ '''w'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|loc = ch. XVI.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Universal tensor prod.svg|right|thumb|200px|[[Commutative diagram]] depicting the universal property of the tensor product.]]
These rules ensure that the map ''f'' from the {{math|''V'' × ''W''}} to {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}} that maps a [[tuple]] {{math|('''v''', '''w''')}} to {{math|'''v''' ⊗ '''w'''}} is bilinear. The universality states that given ''any'' vector space ''X'' and ''any'' bilinear map {{math|''g'' : ''V'' × ''W'' → ''X''}}, there exists a unique map ''u'', shown in the diagram with a dotted arrow, whose [[function composition|composition]] with ''f'' equals ''g'': {{math|1=''u''('''v''' ⊗ '''w''') = ''g''('''v''', '''w''')}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=Th. 14.3}}. See also [[Yoneda lemma]].&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the [[universal property]] of the tensor product, an instance of the method—much used in advanced abstract algebra—to indirectly define objects by specifying maps from or to this object.

==Vector spaces with additional structure==
From the point of view of linear algebra, vector spaces are completely understood insofar as any vector space is characterized, up to isomorphism, by its dimension. However, vector spaces ''per se'' do not offer a framework to deal with the question—crucial to analysis—whether a sequence of functions [[Limit of a sequence|converges]] to another function. Likewise, linear algebra is not adapted to deal with [[infinite series]], since the addition operation allows only finitely many terms to be added. &lt;cite id=labelFunctionalAnalysis&gt;Therefore, the needs of [[functional analysis]] require considering additional structures.&lt;/cite&gt;

A vector space may be given a [[partial order]] ≤, under which some vectors can be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Schaefer|last2=Wolff|year = 1999|loc = pp. 204–205|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''n''-dimensional real space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can be ordered by comparing its vectors componentwise. [[Ordered vector space]]s, for example [[Riesz space]]s, are fundamental to [[Lebesgue integration]], which relies on the ability to express a function as a difference of two positive functions
:''f'' = ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; − ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;,
where ''f''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the positive part of ''f'' and ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; the negative part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 2004|nb = yes|loc=ch. 2, p. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normed vector spaces and inner product spaces===
{{Main|Normed vector space|Inner product space}}
"Measuring" vectors is done by specifying a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], a datum which measures lengths of vectors, or by an [[inner product]], which measures angles between vectors. Norms and inner products are denoted &lt;math&gt;| \mathbf v|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf v , \mathbf w \rang&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The datum of an inner product entails that lengths of vectors can be defined too, by defining the associated norm &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf v| := \sqrt {\langle \mathbf v , \mathbf v \rangle}&lt;/math&gt;. Vector spaces endowed with such data are known as ''normed vector spaces'' and ''inner product spaces'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last =Roman|year = 2005|nb = yes|loc=ch. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coordinate space ''F''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; can be equipped with the standard [[dot product]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x , \mathbf y \rang = \mathbf x \cdot \mathbf y = x_1 y_1 + \cdots + x_n y_n.&lt;/math&gt;
In '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, this reflects the common notion of the angle between two vectors '''x''' and '''y''', by the [[law of cosines]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x \cdot \mathbf y = \cos\left(\angle (\mathbf x, \mathbf y)\right) \cdot |\mathbf x| \cdot |\mathbf y|.&lt;/math&gt;
Because of this, two vectors satisfying &lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x , \mathbf y \rang = 0&lt;/math&gt; are called [[orthogonal]]. An important variant of the standard dot product is used in [[Minkowski space]]: '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; endowed with the Lorentz product
:&lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x | \mathbf y \rang = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_3 - x_4 y_4.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last =Naber|year = 2003|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast to the standard dot product, it is not [[positive definite bilinear form|positive definite]]: &lt;math&gt;\lang \mathbf x | \mathbf x \rang&lt;/math&gt; also takes negative values, for example for &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x = (0, 0, 0, 1)&lt;/math&gt;. Singling out the fourth coordinate—[[timelike|corresponding to time]], as opposed to three space-dimensions—makes it useful for the mathematical treatment of [[special relativity]].

===Topological vector spaces===
{{Main|Topological vector space}}
Convergence questions are treated by considering vector spaces ''V'' carrying a compatible [[topological space|topology]], a structure that allows one to talk about elements being [[neighborhood (topology)|close to each other]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1987|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compatible here means that addition and scalar multiplication have to be [[continuous map]]s.  Roughly, if '''x''' and '''y''' in ''V'', and ''a'' in ''F'' vary by a bounded amount, then so do {{math|'''x''' + '''y'''}} and {{math|''a'''''x'''}}.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;This requirement implies that the topology gives rise to a [[uniform structure]], {{Harvard citations|last = Bourbaki|year = 1989|loc = ch. II|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make sense of specifying the amount a scalar changes, the field ''F'' also has to carry a topology in this context; a common choice are the reals or the complex numbers.

In such ''topological vector spaces'' one can consider [[series (mathematics)|series]] of vectors.  The [[infinite sum]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} f_i&lt;/math&gt;
denotes the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the corresponding finite partial sums of the sequence (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; of elements of ''V''. For example, the ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; could be (real or complex) functions belonging to some [[function space]] ''V'', in which case the series is a [[function series]]. The [[modes of convergence|mode of convergence]] of the series depends on the topology imposed on the function space. In such cases, [[pointwise convergence]] and [[uniform convergence]] are two prominent examples.

[[Image:Vector norms2.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Unit ball|Unit "spheres"]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; consist of plane vectors of norm 1.  Depicted are the unit spheres in different [[Lp norm|''p''-norm]]s, for ''p'' = 1, 2, and ∞. The bigger diamond depicts points of 1-norm equal to 2.]]
A way to ensure the existence of limits of certain infinite series is to restrict attention to spaces where any [[Cauchy sequence]] has a limit; such a vector space is called [[Completeness (topology)|complete]]. Roughly, a vector space is complete provided that it contains all necessary limits. For example, the vector space of polynomials on the unit interval [0,1], equipped with the [[topology of uniform convergence]] is not complete because any continuous function on [0,1] can be uniformly approximated by a sequence of polynomials, by the [[Weierstrass approximation theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§4.11-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the space of ''all'' continuous functions on [0,1] with the same topology is complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kreyszig|1989|loc=§1.5-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A norm gives rise to a topology by defining that a sequence of vectors '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges to '''v''' if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\text{lim}_{n \rightarrow \infty} |\mathbf v_n - \mathbf v| = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Banach and Hilbert spaces are complete topological vector spaces whose topologies are given, respectively, by a norm and an inner product. Their study—a key piece of [[functional analysis]]—focusses on infinite-dimensional vector spaces, since all norms on finite-dimensional topological vector spaces give rise to the same notion of convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last =Choquet|year = 1966|nb = yes|loc=Proposition III.7.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image at the right shows the equivalence of the 1-norm and ∞-norm on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: as the unit "balls" enclose each other, a sequence converges to zero in one norm if and only if it so does in the other norm. In the infinite-dimensional case, however, there will generally be inequivalent topologies, which makes the study of topological vector spaces richer than that of vector spaces without additional data.

From a conceptual point of view, all notions related to topological vector spaces should match the topology. For example, instead of considering all linear maps (also called [[functional (mathematics)|functional]]s) {{math|''V'' → ''W''}}, maps between topological vector spaces are required to be continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=p. 34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the &lt;cite id=label2&gt;(topological) dual space {{math|''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/cite&gt; consists of continuous functionals {{math|''V'' → '''R'''}} (or to {{math|'''C'''}}). The fundamental [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] is concerned with separating subspaces of appropriate topological vector spaces by continuous functionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year =1983|nb = yes|loc=Cor. 4.1.2, p. 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Banach spaces====
{{Main|Banach space}}
''Banach spaces'', introduced by [[Stefan Banach]], are complete normed vector spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=ch. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A first example is [[Lp space|the vector space &lt;math&gt;\ell^{p}&lt;/math&gt;]] 
consisting of infinite vectors with real entries 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n},\ldots\right)&lt;/math&gt;
whose [[p-norm|&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-norm]] 
&lt;math&gt;(1\leq{p}\leq\infty)&lt;/math&gt;
given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}\right\Vert_{p} := \left(\sum_{i} \left\vert x_{i}\right\vert^{p} \right)^{1/p}&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;p &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf x\right\Vert_{\infty} := \text{sup}_{i} \left\vert x_{i}\right\vert&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!---- "is finite." - ?!  ----&gt; 
The topologies on the infinite-dimensional space 
&lt;math&gt;\ell^{p}&lt;/math&gt; 
are inequivalent for different &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. 
E.g. the sequence of vectors 
&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}_{n}=\left(2^{-n}, 2^{-n}, \ldots, 2^{-n},0,0,\ldots\right)&lt;/math&gt;, 
i.e. the first &lt;math&gt;2^{n}&lt;/math&gt; components are &lt;math&gt;2^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;, 
the following ones are &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, converges to the [[zero vector]] for 
&lt;math&gt;p=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, 
but does not for 
&lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\Vert_{_\infty} = \sup (2^{-n}, 0) 
= 2^{-n} \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\Vert_{1} 
= \sum_{i=1}^{2^n} 2^{-n} = 2^n \cdot 2^{-n} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally than sequences of real numbers, functions 
&lt;math&gt;f\colon \Omega \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
are endowed with a norm that replaces the above sum by the [[Lebesgue integral]]
:&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f}\right\Vert_{p} 
:= \left(\int_{\Omega} \left\vert{f}\left(x\right)\right\vert^{p} \, 
{d\mu\left(x\right)} 
\right)^{1/p}.&lt;/math&gt;
The space of [[integrable function]]s on a given [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] 
&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; 
(for example an interval) satisfying 
&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f}\right\Vert_{p}&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;,
and equipped with this norm are called [[Lp space|Lebesgue spaces]], 
denoted &lt;math&gt;L^{\;\!p}\left(\Omega\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The [[Triangle inequality|triangle inequality]] for 
&lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f+g}\right\Vert_{p}
\leq\left\Vert{f}\right\Vert_{p}+\left\Vert{g}\right\Vert_{p}&lt;/math&gt;
is provided by the [[Minkowski inequality]]. For technical reasons, in the context of functions one has to identify functions that agree [[almost everywhere]] to get a norm, and not only a [[seminorm]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

These spaces are complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=Theorem 11.2, p. 102}}&lt;/ref&gt; (If one uses the [[Riemann integral]] instead, the space is ''not'' complete, which may be seen as a justification for Lebesgue's integration theory.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;"Many functions in 
&lt;math&gt;L^{2}&lt;/math&gt; 
of Lebesgue measure, being unbounded, cannot be integrated with the classical Riemann integral. 
So spaces of Riemann integrable functions would not be complete in the 
&lt;math&gt;L^{2}&lt;/math&gt;
norm, and the orthogonal decomposition would not apply to them. 
This shows one of the advantages of Lebesgue integration.", {{Harvard citations|last = Dudley|year = 1989|nb = yes|loc=§5.3, p. 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;) 
Concretely this means that for any sequence of Lebesgue-integrable functions&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
&lt;math&gt;f_{1}, f_{2}, \ldots, f_{n},\ldots&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
with &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert{f}_{n}\right\Vert_{p}&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, 
satisfying the condition
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{k,\ n \to \infty}\int_{\Omega} 
\left\vert{f}_{k}(x)-{f}_{n}(x)\right\vert^{p} \, 
{d\mu\left(x\right)} 
= 0&lt;/math&gt;
there exists a function &lt;math&gt;{f}\left(x\right)&lt;/math&gt; belonging to the vector space &lt;math&gt;L^{\;\!p}\left(\Omega\right)&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{k \to \infty}\int_{\Omega} 
\left\vert{f}\left(x\right)-{f}_{k}\left(x\right)\right\vert^{p} \, 
{d\mu\left(x\right)} 
= 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Imposing boundedness conditions not only on the function, but also on its [[derivative]]s leads to [[Sobolev space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Evans|year = 1998|loc = ch. 5|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hilbert spaces====
{{Main|Hilbert space}}
[[Image:Periodic identity function.gif|right|thumb|400px|The succeeding snapshots show summation of 1 to 5 terms in approximating a periodic function (blue) by finite sum of sine functions (red).]]
Complete inner product spaces are known as ''Hilbert spaces'', in honor of [[David Hilbert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Treves|year = 1967|nb = yes|loc=ch. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Hilbert space ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω), with inner product given by

where &lt;math&gt;\overline{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of ''g''(''x''),&lt;ref name=Dennery&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Dennery|year = 1996|loc = p.190|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;For ''p'' ≠2, ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) is not a Hilbert space.&lt;/ref&gt; is a key case.

By definition, in a Hilbert space any Cauchy sequence converges to a limit. Conversely, finding a sequence of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with desirable properties that approximates a given limit function, is equally crucial. Early analysis, in the guise of the [[Taylor approximation]], established an approximation of [[differentiable function]]s ''f'' by polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = Th. XIII.6, p. 349|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the &lt;cite id=labelStoneWeierstrass&gt;[[Stone–Weierstrass theorem]]&lt;/cite&gt;, every continuous function on {{math|[''a'', ''b'']}} can be approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc = Th. III.1.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approximation technique by [[trigonometric function]]s is commonly called [[Fourier expansion]], and is much applied in engineering, see [[#labelFourier|below]]. &lt;cite id=basis_in_inf_dim_context&gt;More generally, and more conceptually, the theorem yields a simple description of what "basic functions", or, in abstract Hilbert spaces, what basic vectors suffice to generate a Hilbert space ''H'', in the sense that the ''[[closure (topology)|closure]]'' of their span (i.e., finite linear combinations and limits of those) is the whole space.&lt;/cite&gt; Such a set of functions is called a ''basis'' of ''H'', its cardinality is known as the [[Hilbert space dimension]].&lt;ref group=nb&gt;A basis of a Hilbert space is not the same thing as a basis in the sense of linear algebra [[#label1|above]].  For distinction, the latter is then called a [[Hamel basis]].&lt;/ref&gt; Not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions as sufficient for approximation purposes, but together with the [[Gram–Schmidt process]], it enables one to construct a [[orthogonal basis|basis of orthogonal vectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Choquet|year = 1966|loc = Lemma III.16.11|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such orthogonal bases are the Hilbert space generalization of the coordinate axes in finite-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].

The solutions to various [[differential equation]]s can be interpreted in terms of Hilbert spaces. For example, a great many fields in physics and engineering lead to such equations and frequently solutions with particular physical properties are used as basis functions, often orthogonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|last=Kreyszig|year=1999|loc=Chapter 11|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example from physics, the time-dependent [[Schrödinger equation]] in [[quantum mechanics]] describes the change of physical properties in time by means of a [[partial differential equation]], whose solutions are called [[wavefunction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvs|last=Griffiths|year=1995|loc=Chapter 1|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definite values for physical properties such as energy, or momentum, correspond to [[eigenvalue]]s of a certain (linear) [[differential operator]] and the associated wavefunctions are called [[eigenstate]]s. The &lt;cite id=labelSpectralTheorem&gt;[[spectral theorem]] decomposes a linear [[compact operator]] acting on functions in terms of these eigenfunctions and their eigenvalues.&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc =ch.

===Algebras over fields===
{{Main|Algebra over a field|Lie algebra}}
[[Image:Rectangular hyperbola.svg|right|thumb|250px|A [[hyperbola]], given by the equation {{math|1=''x'' ⋅ ''y'' = 1}}. The [[coordinate ring]] of functions on this hyperbola is given by {{math|'''R'''[''x'', ''y''] / (''x'' &amp;middot; ''y'' − 1)}}, an infinite-dimensional vector space over {{math|'''R'''}}.]]
General vector spaces do not possess a multiplication between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional [[bilinear operator]] defining the multiplication of two vectors is an ''algebra over a field''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|nb = yes|loc=ch. III.1, p. 121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many algebras stem from functions on some geometrical object: since functions with values in a given field can be multiplied pointwise, these entities form algebras. The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned [[#labelStoneWeierstrass|above]], for example, relies on [[Banach algebra]]s which are both Banach spaces and algebras.

[[Commutative algebra]] makes great use of [[polynomial ring|rings of polynomials]] in one or several variables, introduced [[#labelPolynomialRing|above]]. Their multiplication is both [[commutative]] and [[associative]]. These rings and their [[quotient ring|quotients]] form the basis of [[algebraic geometry]], because they are [[coordinate ring|rings of functions of algebraic geometric objects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Eisenbud|year = 1995|nb = yes|loc=ch. 1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another crucial example are ''Lie algebras'', which are neither commutative nor associative, but the failure to be so is limited by the constraints ({{math|[''x'', ''y'']}} denotes the product of {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}):
*{{math|1=[''x'', ''y''] = −[''y'', ''x'']}} ([[anticommutativity]]), and
*{{math|1=[''x'', [''y'', ''z'']] + [''y'', [''z'', ''x'']] + [''z'', [''x'', ''y'']] = 0}} ([[Jacobi identity]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Varadarajan|year = 1974|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples include the vector space of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices, with {{math|1=[''x'', ''y''] = ''xy'' − ''yx''}}, the [[commutator]] of two matrices, and {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, endowed with the [[cross product]].

The [[tensor algebra]] T(''V'') is a formal way of adding products to any vector space ''V'' to obtain an algebra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|nb = yes|loc=ch. XVI.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a vector space, it is spanned by symbols, called simple [[tensor]]s
:{{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ... ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where the [[rank of a tensor|degree]] {{math|''n''}} varies.
The multiplication is given by concatenating such symbols, imposing the [[distributive law]] under addition, and requiring that scalar multiplication commute with the tensor product ⊗, much the same way as with the tensor product of two vector spaces introduced [[#Tensor product|above]]. In general, there are no relations between {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Forcing two such elements to be equal leads to the [[symmetric algebra]], whereas forcing {{math|1='''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = − '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ '''v'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} yields the [[exterior algebra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 2002|nb = yes|loc=ch. XVI.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a field, {{math|''F''}} is explicitly stated, a common term used is {{math|''F''}}-algebra.

==Applications==
Vector spaces have many applications as they occur frequently in common circumstances, namely wherever functions with values in some field are involved. They provide a framework to deal with analytical and geometrical problems, or are used in the Fourier transform. This list is not exhaustive: many more applications exist, for example in [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. The [[minimax theorem]] of [[game theory]] stating the existence of a unique payoff when all players play optimally can be formulated and proven using vector spaces methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Luenberger|year = 1997|nb = yes|loc=§7.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Representation theory]] fruitfully transfers the good understanding of linear algebra and vector spaces to other mathematical domains such as [[group theory]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[representation theory]] and [[group representation]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distributions===
{{Main|Distribution (mathematics)|l1=Distribution}}
A ''distribution'' (or ''generalized function'') is a linear map assigning a number to each [[test function|"test" function]], typically a [[smooth function]] with [[compact support]], in a continuous way: in the [[#label2|above]] terminology the space of distributions is the (continuous) dual of the test function space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Lang|year = 1993|loc =Ch. XI.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter space is endowed with a topology that takes into account not only ''f'' itself, but also all its higher derivatives. A standard example is the result of integrating a test function ''f'' over some domain Ω:
:&lt;math&gt;I(f) = \int_\Omega f(x)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;
When {{math|1=Ω = {''p''},}} the set consisting of a single point, this reduces to the [[Dirac distribution]], denoted by δ, which associates to a test function ''f'' its value at the {{math|1=''p'': δ(''f'') = ''f''(''p'')}}. Distributions are a powerful instrument to solve differential equations. Since all standard analytic notions such as derivatives are linear, they extend naturally to the space of distributions. Therefore, the equation in question can be transferred to a distribution space, which is bigger than the underlying function space, so that more flexible methods are available for solving the equation. For example, [[Green's function]]s and [[fundamental solution]]s are usually distributions rather than proper functions, and can then be used to find solutions of the equation with prescribed boundary conditions. The found solution can then in some cases be proven to be actually a true function, and a solution to the original equation (e.g., using the [[Lax–Milgram theorem]], a consequence of the [[Riesz representation theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Evans|year = 1998|loc =Th. 6.2.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourier analysis===
{{Main|Fourier analysis}}
[[Image:Heat eqn.gif|thumb|right|200px|The heat equation describes the dissipation of physical properties over time, such as the decline of the temperature of a hot body placed in a colder environment (yellow depicts colder regions than red).]]

Resolving a [[periodic function]] into a sum of [[trigonometric functions]] forms a &lt;cite id=labelFourier&gt;''[[Fourier series]]''&lt;/cite&gt;, a technique much used in physics and engineering.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Although the Fourier series is periodic, the technique can be applied to any ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function on an interval by considering the function to be continued periodically outside the interval. See {{Harvard citations|last = Kreyszig|year = 1988|loc=p. 601|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Folland|year = 1992|loc = p. 349 ''ff''|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying vector space is usually the [[Hilbert space]] ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(0, 2π), for which the functions sin ''mx'' and cos ''mx'' (''m'' an integer) form an orthogonal basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=p. 150|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fourier expansion]] of an ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; function ''f'' is
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\left[a_m\cos\left(mx\right)+b_m\sin\left(mx\right)\right].
&lt;/math&gt;

The coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; are called [[Fourier coefficient]]s of ''f'', and are calculated by the formulas&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=§4.5|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a_m = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} f(t) \cos (mt) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_m = \frac{1}{\pi} \int_0^{2 \pi} f(t) \sin (mt) \, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

In physical terms the function is represented as a [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of [[sine waves]] and the coefficients give information about the function's [[frequency spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=p. 57|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general [[duality (mathematics)|mathematical duality]] called [[Pontryagin duality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1=Loomis  | year=1953|loc=Ch. VII|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to the [[group (mathematics)|group]] '''R''', it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are [[reciprocal lattice]]s, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space endowed with the additional datum of a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] encoding positions of [[atom]]s in [[crystal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1=Ashcroft | last2=Mermin | year=1976|loc=Ch. 5|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourier series are used to solve [[boundary value problem]]s in [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kreyszig|year = 1988|loc=p. 667|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822, [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]] first used this technique to solve the [[heat equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Fourier|year = 1822|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A discrete version of the Fourier series can be used in [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]] applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=p. 67|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of coefficients is known as the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT is one of the key tools of [[digital signal processing]], a field whose applications include [[radar]], [[speech encoding]], [[image compression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Ifeachor|last2 = Jervis|year=2002|loc=pp. 3–4, 11|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[JPEG]] image format is an application of the closely related [[discrete cosine transform]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wallace|year = Feb 1992|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fast Fourier transform]] is an algorithm for rapidly computing the discrete Fourier transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Ifeachor|last2 = Jervis|year=2002|loc=p. 132|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used not only for calculating the Fourier coefficients but, using the [[convolution theorem]], also for computing the [[convolution]] of two finite sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=§10.2|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They in turn are applied in [[digital filter]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Ifeachor|last2 = Jervis|year=2002|loc=pp. 307–310|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a rapid [[multiplication algorithm]] for polynomials and large integers ([[Schönhage–Strassen algorithm]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Gasquet|last2 = Witomski|year=1999|loc=§10.3|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1=Schönhage|last2=Strassen|year=1971|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differential geometry===
{{Main|Tangent space}}
[[Image:Image Tangent-plane.svg|right|thumb|200px|The tangent space to the [[2-sphere]] at some point is the infinite plane touching the sphere in this point.]]
The [[tangent plane]] to a surface at a point is naturally a vector space whose origin is identified with the point of contact.  The tangent plane is the best [[linear approximation]], or [[linearization]], of a surface at a point.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;That is to say {{harv|BSE-3|2001}}, the plane passing through the point of contact ''P'' such that the distance from a point ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the surface to the plane is [[little o|infinitesimally small]] compared to the distance from ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''P'' in the limit as ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; approaches ''P'' along the surface.&lt;/ref&gt; Even in a three-dimensional Euclidean space, there is typically no natural way to prescribe a basis of the tangent plane, and so it is conceived of as an abstract vector space rather than a real coordinate space. The ''tangent space'' is the generalization to higher-dimensional [[differentiable manifold]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Spivak|year = 1999|loc = ch. 3|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Riemannian manifold]]s are manifolds whose tangent spaces are endowed with a [[Riemannian metric|suitable inner product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Jost|year = 2005|nb = yes}}. See also [[Lorentzian manifold]].&lt;/ref&gt; Derived therefrom, the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] encodes all [[curvature (mathematics)|curvatures]] of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in [[general relativity]], for example, where the [[Einstein curvature tensor]] describes the matter and energy content of [[space-time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last1 = Misner|last2=Thorne|last3=Wheeler|year = 1973|loc = ch. 1.8.7, p. 222 and ch. 2.13.5, p. 325|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Jost|year = 2005|loc = ch. 3.1|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tangent space of a Lie group can be given naturally the structure of a Lie algebra and can be used to classify [[compact Lie group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Varadarajan|year = 1974|loc = ch. 4.3, Theorem 4.3.27|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

===Vector bundles===
{{Main|Vector bundle|Tangent bundle}}
[[Image:Mobius strip illus.svg|thumb|249px|right|A Möbius strip. Locally, it [[homeomorphism|looks like]] {{math|''U'' × '''R'''}}.]]
A ''vector bundle'' is a family of vector spaces parametrized continuously by a [[topological space]] ''X''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; More precisely, a vector bundle over ''X'' is a topological space ''E'' equipped with a continuous map 
:π&amp;thinsp;: ''E'' → ''X''
such that for every ''x'' in ''X'', the [[fiber (mathematics)|fiber]] π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') is a vector space. The case dim {{math|1=''V'' = 1}} is called a [[line bundle]]. For any vector space ''V'', the projection {{math|''X'' × ''V'' → ''X''}} makes the product {{math|''X'' × ''V''}} into a [[trivial bundle|"trivial" vector bundle]]. Vector bundles over ''X'' are required to be [[locally]] a product of ''X'' and some (fixed) vector space ''V'': for every ''x'' in ''X'', there is a [[neighborhood (topology)|neighborhood]] ''U'' of ''x'' such that the restriction of π to π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') is isomorphic&lt;ref group=nb&gt;That is, there is a [[homeomorphism]] from π&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''U'') to {{math|''V'' × ''U''}} which restricts to linear isomorphisms between fibers.&lt;/ref&gt; to the trivial bundle {{math|''U'' × ''V'' → ''U''}}. Despite their locally trivial character, vector bundles may (depending on the shape of the underlying space ''X'') be "twisted" in the large (i.e., the bundle need not be (globally isomorphic to) the trivial bundle {{math|''X'' × ''V''}}). For example, the [[Möbius strip]] can be seen as a line bundle over the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (by [[homeomorphism#Examples|identifying open intervals with the real line]]). It is, however, different from the [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × '''R'''}}, because the latter is [[orientable manifold|orientable]] whereas the former is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kreyszig|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=§34, p. 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properties of certain vector bundles provide information about the underlying topological space. For example, the [[tangent bundle]] consists of the collection of [[tangent space]]s parametrized by the points of a differentiable manifold. The tangent bundle of the circle ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is globally isomorphic to {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × '''R'''}}, since there is a global nonzero [[vector field]] on ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;A line bundle, such as the tangent bundle of ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is trivial if and only if there is a [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] that vanishes nowhere, see {{Harvard citations|last = Husemoller|year = 1994|nb = yes|loc=Corollary 8.3}}. The sections of the tangent bundle are just [[vector field]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, by the [[hairy ball theorem]], there is no (tangent) vector field on the [[2-sphere]] ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; which is everywhere nonzero.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvard citations|last1=Eisenberg|last2=Guy|year=1979|nb=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[K-theory]] studies the isomorphism classes of all vector bundles over some topological space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Atiyah|year = 1989|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to deepening topological and geometrical insight, it has purely algebraic consequences, such as the classification of finite-dimensional real [[division algebra]]s: '''R''', '''C''', the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and the [[octonion]]s '''O'''.

The [[cotangent bundle]] of a differentiable manifold consists, at every point of the manifold, of the dual of the tangent space, the [[cotangent space]]. [[Section (fiber bundle)|Sections]] of that bundle are known as [[differential form|differential one-form]]s.

===Modules===
{{Main|Module (mathematics)|l1=Module}}
''Modules'' are to [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] what vector spaces are to fields: the same axioms, applied to a ring ''R'' instead of a field ''F'', yield modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Artin|year = 1991|nb = yes|loc=ch. 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of modules, compared to that of vector spaces, is complicated by the presence of ring elements that do not have [[multiplicative inverse]]s. For example, modules need not have bases, as the '''Z'''-module (i.e., [[abelian group]]) [[Modular arithmetic|'''Z'''/2'''Z''']] shows; those modules that do (including all vector spaces) are known as [[free module]]s. Nevertheless, a vector space can be compactly defined as a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] which is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] with the elements being called vectors.  Some authors use the term ''vector space'' to mean modules over a [[division ring]].&lt;ref&gt;Grillet, Pierre Antoine. Abstract algebra. Vol. 242. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The algebro-geometric interpretation of commutative rings via their [[spectrum of a ring|spectrum]] allows the development of concepts such as [[locally free module]]s, the algebraic counterpart to vector bundles.

===Affine and projective spaces===
{{Main|Affine space|Projective space}}
[[Image:Affine subspace.svg|thumb|right|200px|An [[affine space|affine plane]] (light blue) in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It is a two-dimensional subspace shifted by a vector '''x''' (red).]] 
Roughly, ''affine spaces'' are vector spaces whose origins are not specified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Meyer|year = 2000|nb = yes|loc=Example 5.13.5, p. 436}}&lt;/ref&gt; More precisely, an affine space is a set with a [[transitive group action|free transitive]] vector space [[group action|action]]. In particular, a vector space is an affine space over itself, by the map
:{{math|''V'' × ''V'' → ''V'', ('''v''', '''a''') ↦ '''a''' + '''v'''}}.
If ''W'' is a vector space, then an affine subspace is a subset of ''W'' obtained by translating a linear subspace ''V'' by a fixed vector {{math|'''x''' ∈ ''W''}}; this space is denoted by {{math|'''x''' + ''V''}} (it is a [[coset]] of ''V'' in ''W'') and consists of all vectors of the form {{math|'''x''' + '''v'''}} for {{math|'''v''' ∈ ''V''.}} An important example is the space of solutions of a system of inhomogeneous linear equations
:''A'''''x''' = '''b'''
generalizing the homogeneous case {{math|1='''b''' = 0}} [[#equation3|above]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Meyer|year = 2000|nb = yes|loc=Exercise 5.13.15–17, p. 442}}&lt;/ref&gt; The space of solutions is the affine subspace {{math|'''x''' + ''V''}} where '''x''' is a particular solution of the equation, and ''V'' is the space of solutions of the homogeneous equation (the [[nullspace]] of ''A'').

The set of one-dimensional subspaces of a fixed finite-dimensional vector space ''V'' is known as ''projective space''; it may be used to formalize the idea of [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines intersecting at infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Coxeter|year = 1987|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grassmannian manifold|Grassmannians]] and [[flag manifold]]s generalize this by parametrizing linear subspaces of fixed dimension ''k'' and [[flag (linear algebra)|flags]] of subspaces, respectively.

'''Wim Delvoye''' (born 1965 in [[Wervik]], [[West Flanders]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/5719|title=Guggenheim|work=Guggenheim|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a Belgian neo-conceptual artist known for his inventive and often shocking projects. Much of his work is focused on the body. He repeatedly links the attractive with the repulsive, creating work that holds within it inherent contradictions – one does not know whether to stare, be seduced, or to look away.{{according to whom|date=December 2016}} As the critic [[Robert Enright]] wrote in the art magazine ''Border Crossings'', "Delvoye is involved in a way of making art that reorients our understanding of how beauty can be created".&lt;ref name="Enright"&gt;[http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/articles/record.html?record=412 Enright, Robert. "Vim &amp; Vigour; An Interview with Wim Delvoye". ''Border Crossings'' 96 (2005): n. pag. Web. 4 Jun 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Wim Delvoye has an eclectic oeuvre, exposing his interest in a range of themes, from bodily function, and scatology to the function of art in the current market economy, and numerous subjects in between. He lives and works in Brighton, UK.

==Early life==
Delvoye was raised in [[Wervik]], a small town in West Flanders, Belgium. He did not have a religious upbringing but has been influenced by the Roman Catholic architecture that surrounded him. In a conversation with Michaël Amy of the ''New York Times'', Delvoye stated, "I have vivid memories of crowds marching behind a single statue as well as of people kneeling in front of painted and carved altarpieces… Although I was barely aware of the ideas lurking behind these types of images, I soon understood that paintings and sculptures were of great importance".&lt;ref name=AmyNYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Amy|first=Michaël|title=The Body As Machine, Taken To Its Extreme|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/arts/art-architecture-the-body-as-machine-taken-to-its-extreme.html|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=20 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Growing up, Delvoye attended exhibitions with his parents, and his love of drawing eventually led him to art school, the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Ghent)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgischekunst.be/2012/09/wim-delvoye-1965/|title=Wim Delvoye (1965-  ) — Aspecten van de Belgische kunst na '45|website=belgischekunst.be}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delvoye has said that the pessimistic expectations for Belgian art students freed him, essentially making him realize that he “had nothing to lose”.&lt;ref name="AmyNYT" /&gt; Shortly thereafter, Delvoye began painting over wallpaper and carpets, coloring in the existing patterns and defying the tendency towards free expression vibrant in the art world at the time.

Delvoye considers himself an originator of concepts—he is attracted initially to the theory behind pieces, instead of the act of painting itself. After 1990, specialists directed by Delvoye have executed most of his work. In 1992, Delvoye received international recognition with the presentation of his “Mosaic” at Documenta IX, a symmetrical display of glazed tiles featuring photographs of his own excrement. The organizer of Documenta IX, Jan Hoet claimed, “The strength of Wim Delvoye lies in his ability to engineer conflict by combining the fine arts and folk art, and playing seriousness against irony.”&lt;ref name="AmyNYT"/&gt;  Three of his most well known projects are “Cloaca”, “Art Farm”, and a series of Gothic works.

==''Cloaca''==
[[File:Berriedale TAS 7011, Australia - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|Delvoye's ''Cloaca'' is on permanent display at the [[Museum of Old and New Art]] (MONA) in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], Australia.]]
Delvoye is perhaps best known for his digestive machine, ''Cloaca'', which he unveiled at the Museum voor Hedendaagse Kunst, Antwerp, after eight years of consultation with experts in fields ranging from plumbing to gastroenterology.&lt;ref name="criqui"&gt;[http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/articles/record.html?record=366 Criqui, Jean-Pierre . "Eater’s Digest". ''Artforum'' 1 Sep.2001 : 182 – 183 . Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a comment on the Belgians’ love of fine dining, ''Cloaca'' is a large installation that turns food into [[feces]], allowing Delvoye to explore the digestive process. In his large mechanism, food begins at a long, transparent bowl (mouth), travels through a number of machine-like assembly stations, and ends in hard matter which is separated from liquid through a cylinder.&lt;ref name="AmyNYT"/&gt; Delvoye collects and sells the realistically smelling output, suspended in small jars of resin at his Ghent studio. When asked about his inspiration, Delvoye stated that everything in modern life is pointless. The most useless object he could create was a machine that serves no purpose at all, besides the reduction of food to waste. ''Cloaca'' has appeared in many incarnations including: ''Cloaca Original'', ''Cloaca - New &amp; Improved'', ''Cloaca Turbo'', ''Cloaca Quattro'', ''Cloaca N° 5'', and ''Personal Cloaca''.&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Grimes|first=William|title=Down the Hatch|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/30/dining/critic-s-notebook-down-the-hatch.html|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=30 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delvoye also sold specially printed toilet paper as a souvenir of the exhibit. In 2016, 5 rolls from the 2007 Mudam Luxembourg exhibit were offered for re-sale for US$300 through an online vendor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/more-furniture-collectibles/curiosities/super-cloaca-toilet-paper-roll-wim-delvoye-2007/id-f_5502343/#0 First Dibs.com], Retrieved September 27, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commissioned ''Cloaca'' for MONA===
Previously, Delvoye claimed that he would never sell a ''Cloaca'' machine to a museum as he could never trust that the [[curator]] would maintain the installation properly. However, after two years of discussion with [[David Walsh (art collector)|David Walsh]], Delvoye agreed to construct a custom ''Cloaca'' built specifically for the [[Museum of Old and New Art]] in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]]. The new installation is suspended from the museum ceiling in a room custom-built for it.&lt;ref name="theartnewspaper.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/A-subversive-Disneyland-at-the-end-of-the-world/21204|title=A "Subversive Disneyland" at the End of the World|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art Farm==
Though Delvoye started [[tattoo]]ing pig skins taken from slaughterhouses in the United States in 1992, he began to tattoo live pigs in 1997. Delvoye was interested in the idea that “the pig would literally grow in value,"&lt;ref name="laster"&gt;[http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/articles/record.html?record=587 Laster, Paul. "Bringing Home the Bacon: Wim Delvoye". ''ArtAsiaPacific'' 30 September 2007 : 154-159 . Print. ]&lt;/ref&gt; both in a physical and economic sense. He ultimately moved the operation to an Art Farm in China in 2004. The pigs have been inked with a diverse array of designs, including the trivial, such as skulls and crosses, to Louis Vuitton designs, to designs dictated by the pig's anatomy".&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;[http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/articles/record.html?record=388 Harris, Gareth. "Artist Banks on Pigs and Artificial S**t". ''Art Newspaper'' 6 October 2005 : 1, 7 . Print.]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[ArtAsiaPacific]]'s'' Paul Laster, Delvoye described the process of tattooing a live pig, "we sedate it, shave it and apply [[Vaseline]] to its skin".&lt;ref name="laster" /&gt;

==Gothic works==
Delvoye is additionally well known for his “[[Goth subculture|gothic]]” style work. In 2001, Delvoye, with the help of a [[radiologist]], had several of his friends paint themselves with small amounts of [[Radiocontrast agent|barium]], and perform [[wikt:explicit|explicit]] [[Human sexual activity|sexual]] acts in medical X-ray clinics. He then used the X-ray scans to fill gothic window frames instead of classic [[stained glass]]. Delvoye suggests that radiography reduces the body to a machine.&lt;ref name="AmyNYT"/&gt; When he was not an active participant, Delvoye observed from a computer screen in another room, allowing the subjects enough distance to perform normally, although Delvoye has described the whole operation as "very medical, very antiseptic".&lt;ref name="laster x ray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speronewestwater.com/cgi-bin/iowa/articles/record.html?record=192|title=Laster, Paul. "XXX-ray vision".

These structures juxtapose "medieval craftsmanship with Gothic filigree".&lt;ref name="public art fund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicartfund.org/pafweb/projects/03/delvoye_w_release_03.html|title=Home|website=www.publicartfund.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delvoye brings together the heavy, brute force of contemporary machinery and the delicate craftsmanship associated with Gothic architecture.

In a 2013 show in New York City, Delvoye showed intricate laser-cut works combining architectural and figurative references with shapes such as a [[Möbius band]] or a [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblot]].&lt;ref name=Cashdan&gt;{{cite news|last=Cashdan|first=Marina|title=New Provocations From the Belgian Bad Boy Wim Delvoye|url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/on-view-new-provocations-from-the-belgian-bad-boy-wim-delvoye/|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Inspection Panel''' is an independent [[accountability]] mechanism of the [[World Bank]]. It was established in September 1993 by the World Bank [[Board of Directors]], and started operations on August 1, 1994. The Panel provides a forum for people who believe that they may be adversely affected by Bank-financed operations to bring their concerns to the highest decision-making levels of the World Bank. The Panel determines whether the Bank is complying with its own policies and procedures, which are designed to ensure that Bank-financed operations provide social and environmental benefits and avoid harm to people and the environment. The Inspection Panel was the first body to promote accountability among international financial institutions through this community-led, or “bottom-up”, approach which is complementary to the “top-down” forms of accountability, such as evaluation initiated by the World Bank itself. Building on this example, other multilateral and regional financial institutions have established similar accountability mechanisms as part of broader efforts at sustainable and equitable development.

==Mandate==
The Inspection Panel's mandate allows it to investigate projects funded by the [[International Development Association|IDA]] and [[IBRD]], both part of the World Bank Group, and to determine whether they are complying with their policies and procedures in the design, appraisal, and implementation of a project. These policies and procedures are not limited to the Bank’s social and environmental safeguard policies, but include other operational policies, bank procedures, and operational directives, as well as other Bank procedural documents.

==Operation==

=== Organization===
The Inspection Panel consists of three members who are appointed by the Board of Directors for non-renewable periods of five years. In addition, an Executive Secretariat was established to assist and support all Panel activities. The Panel is independent of Bank management and is provided with independent resources to discharge its functions.

=== Process ===
The Panel process begins when it receives a request for inspection from a party of two or more Requesters, claiming that the Bank has violated its policies and procedures. Most requests concern some of the Bank’s safeguard policies, such as the policies on environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous people. 

Once the Panel has received and registered a request for inspection, the eligibility phase of the Inspection Process commences. Beginning on the day of registration the World Bank’s management has 21 days to provide the Panel with evidence that it complied or intended to comply with the Bank’s relevant policies and procedures. After receiving management's response, the Panel has 21 business days to determine the eligibility of the request.

Once it has been determined that the eligibility criteria have been met, and after having reviewed the management response to the request, the Panel may, taking other factors it may have discovered during a field visit into consideration, make a recommendation to investigate. In some cases, the Panel has promoted problem solving between management and the requesters to help mediate less contentious cases and lead to an earlier resolution of community concerns or policy compliance problems.

An investigation is not automatic, and can only be authorized by the Board of Executive Directors. If the Board approves, the next step is the substantive phase of the inspection process when the Panel evaluates the merits of the request. In the investigation phase, the Panel is focused on fact finding and verification. It visits the borrowing country and meets with the requesters and other affected people, as well as with a broad array of people from whom it can learn in detail about the issues, concerns, the project's status, and potential harmful effects. The investigation phase may take a few months, or longer, in complex cases.

Once the investigation phase is complete, the Panel submits its Investigation Report to Bank management. The Board meets to consider both the Panel's Investigation Report and management’s recommendations, before deciding whether to approve the recommendations. The Board may ask the Panel to check whether management has made appropriate consultations about the remedial measures with the affected people.

== History ==

During the 1980s the Bank had begun developing and committing itself to operational policies and procedures, including policies on involuntary resettlement (1980), tribal peoples (1982), and environmental assessment (1988). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, widespread voices of concern and protest from civil society and project-affected communities questioned the social and environmental impacts of Bank-financed operations. A central element of this critique was that the Bank was not complying with its policy commitments which it had adopted to prevent these very types of adverse social and environmental impacts. Serious debates on these issues also took place within the Bank’s member governments and the Bank itself.

In June 1992, the international community gathered at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro to chart a new cooperative approach to addressing interrelated issues of social development, economic development, and environmental protection. The blueprint for the creation of the Inspection Panel was developed in this larger context as a result of efforts from civil society, governments, and members of the Bank’s Board to establish a new and independent mechanism for greater accountability, participation, and transparency at the World Bank.

=== Creation ===
The Panel was officially created by two similar resolutions of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Agency (IDA) signed by the Board of Executive Directors on September 1, 1993 (Resolution IBRD 93–10 and Resolution IDA 93–6). The Resolution specifies that the Panel has jurisdiction with respect to operations supported by the IBRD and the IDA. In 1996 and 1999, clarifications were added to the Resolution.

The four units which concur to the improvement of accountability and [[internal control]] at the World Bank are (in alphabetical order):
* The [[Independent Evaluation Group]] (IEG), whose Director-General reports directly to the Bank Group’s Board of [[Executive director|Executive Directors]].
* The Inspection Panel (IPN). Its three members are appointed by the Board of Directors, and independent of Bank Management.
* The Institutional Integrity Vice Presidency (INT), whose VP reports to the World Bank's President. The Independent Advisory Board provides advice to the [[World Bank Group]] on [[governance]] and [[Corruption|anti-corruption]] measures, helps protect the independence and strengthens the accountability of INT by giving advice on policies and procedures and on the department’s interactions within the World Bank Group. It also provides advice to President [[Robert Zoellick]] and the World Bank Group Audit Committee on the performance of INT.
* The [[Internal Auditing]] Department (IAD), whose VP [[Auditor General]] reports to the World Bank's President and to the [[Audit Committee]] of the Board of Executive Directors.
