'''''SRM – Associazione Studi e Ricerche per il Mezzogiorno'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sr-m.it/?lang=en |title=Official Website|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Italy|Italian]] Study Centre founded in [[Naples]] in 2003 which aims to improve the knowledge of Italian economy in terms of infrastructural, productive and social assets, proceeding from a European and Mediterranean perspective. From the Study Centre of the [[Banco di Napoli]], established in 1931, SRM inherited a consolidated know-how in the analysis of the economic dynamics of the South of Italy. Over the years, it has implemented its research from an international point of view.

Its founders are four banks of the [[Intesa Sanpaolo Group]], the Banco di Napoli Foundation and the Turin-based Compagnia di San Paolo Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.compagniadisanpaolo.it/|title=Compagnia di San Paolo|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the [[President (corporate title)|President]] of SRM is Paolo Scudieri and the [[General Manager]] is Massimo Deandreis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sr-m.it/chi-siamo/?lang=en |title=About Us|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and Research==

SRM is a Study Centre related to the [[Intesa Sanpaolo Group]]. It specializes in the analysis of regional economic dynamics, with a particular eye towards Southern Italy. In this context, it carries out studies and research monitoring of the performance of productive sectors, investigating economic and financial scenarios, interdependence and internationalisation, and the economic value of the non-profit sector. SRM publishes studies and research in three types of publishing products: monographic research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/ricerche-monografiche-en/?lang=en|title=Researches|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; periodical reports &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/rapporti-periodici/?lang=en|title=Periodical Reports|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/reviews/?lang=en|title=Reviews|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Since 2003 SRM has provided much research on topics related to numerous Italian economic sectors: automotive, aerospace, agri-food, pharmaceutical, textile, tourism, water, renewable energy, and many others.
* Among the periodic reports, SRM has a line of reports produced in collaboration with other Institutes: the semi-yearly report "Check up Mezzogiorno"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/check-up-mezzogiorno/|title=Check Up Mezzogiorno|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; together with [[Confindustria]]; the "Territorial Finance in Italy" Report, in collaboration with IRES, IRPET, Eupolis Lombardia, IPRES and Liguria Ricerche; and the Report on the internationalisation of Italian regions, in collaboration with Intesa Sanpaolo Research Department. SRM also publishes the Young Entrepreneurs Observatory and the Mezzogiorno Bulletin.
* SRM also edits three magazines. Since 1993, it has been publishing the bi-monthly magazine ''Dossier Unione Europea'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/dossier-ue/|title= Dossier UE|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to monitor European policies and their impact on the Italian economy. Since 2004, it has been editing the international magazine ''Rassegna Economica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/rassegna-economica/|title= Rassegna Economica|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1931 by the Banco di Napoli. Since 2016, SRM has also published a half-yearly magazine ''Quaderni di Economia Sociale'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/cp/quaderni-di-economia-sociale//|title= Quaderni di Economia Sociale|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the subject of non-profit and social solidarity, carried out together with the Fondazione con il Sud and with the collaboration of Banca Prossima ([[Intesa Sanpaolo]] Banking Group), established as a periodic report in 2012.

SRM has also activated two permanent observatories: the first one, on the Maritime Economy, monitors the economic impact of the logistics and maritime transport sector; the second, on the Mediterranean Economy, monitors the dynamics of the commercial relations between Italy (and in particular the South of Italy) and the Mediterranean countries. Italy, including its southern regions, plays a natural role as an economic and logistic bridge between Europe and the southern shores of the Mediterranean, where the great maritime trade routes pass to and from Asia and America.

==Maritime Economy Permanent Observatory==

''Maritime Economy'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/|title=Maritime Economy|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a SRM project born in 2014 with the aim to establish a permanent observatory on the logistics and maritime transport sector. SRM has always had a consolidated research area dedicated to this field of studies because it has always believed that efficient and effective maritime transport fosters internationalization, innovation, investments in infrastructure, and employment and GDP growth.

The Maritime Economy Observatory manifests itself in a website (http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/ - in [[English language|English]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]) that offers a wealth of analysis and studies on the topic of maritime transport seen from a variety of standpoints: from the business side (e.g. the shipping industry), from the point of view of infrastructures (ports), and in terms of individual sectors and territories (for instance by taking a closer look at the maritime transport strategies pursued by other countries).

An Annual Report titled "Italian Maritime Economy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-maritimeconomy.com/cp/annual-report/|title= Italian Maritime Economy Annual Report|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published every year, in June. This Report is the result of SRM analyses and its study missions abroad. It includes also scientific articles by international experts in the sector. In the course of its research activity on the maritime economy, SRM has created numerous "networks" formed by entities of varying nature - business associations, companies, infrastructure components, institutions – each of which, in its own way, provides added value to the research activity and papers offered.

SRM, in Shanghai on 13 December 2016, signed the Cooperation Agreement called "Global Shipping Think Tank Alliance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sr-m.it/srm-firma-a-shanghai-laccordo-global-shipping-think-tank-alliance/?lang=en|title= Global Shipping Think Tank Alliance|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a partnership fostered by the Shanghai International Shipping Institute (SISI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.sisi-smu.org/|title= Shangai International Shipping Institute|publisher=SISI}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most important Chinese research centres in the world for research on shipping, logistics and the port industry. The Agreement involves the most prestigious research institutes on the maritime economy of [[China]], [[Japan]], [[the United States]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Germany]] and the [[UK]]. SRM was the only Italian study centre and one of three European entities to become a partner in the initiative, which was endorsed to implement joint studies on maritime transport, to exchange research and analysis methods, to propose policies to public policy makers with the aim to develop port and logistics infrastructure, and to organize meetings to discuss and debate the economic trends of the sea-related sectors.
With this agreement SRM strengthens its ability to analyse and forecast trends in the economics of the maritime industry and the dynamics of shipping and port logistics, expanding its cooperation with international economic think tanks such as the [[Kühne Logistics University of Hamburg]], the [[University of Antwerp]] and the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]], which are globally recognized in the field of the maritime economy.

==Mediterranean Economy Permanent Observatory==

The Permanent Observatory on the Economic Relations between Italy and the Mediterranean Area &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-med.com/|title= Mediterranean Observatory|publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a project realized by SRM and born in 2011 thanks to the sponsorship of the &lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Compagnia di San Paolo]]&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; with the aim to monitor and study the dynamics and the impact of mutual economic relations between [[Italy]] (and in particular Southern Italy) and the Mediterranean Area.

SRM has established this new field of research developing a strong network of relations with other national and international Research Centres on the Mediterranean Area. The Observatory analyses in particular two geographic areas - the Southern Mediterranean Area ([[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]] and [[Egypt]]) and the Eastern Mediterranean Area ([[Israel]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Turkey]]) - investigating the commercial, financial, infrastructural, entrepreneurial, energetic and technological inter-exchange relations, paying special attention to business indicators and normative-institutional dynamics affecting the Euro-Mediterranean Area. The Adriatic Mediterranean Area ([[Albania]], [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Montenegro]]) is investigated separately. Since 2015 the analysis has been extended to the [[Gulf Countries]] ([[Bahrain]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[United Arab Emirates]]).

SRM Med Observatory represents a permanent laboratory the activity of which takes place on the website. At the end of each year of research activities the Mediterranean Observatory gives life to the "Annual Report on Economic Relations between Italy and the Mediterranean",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srm-med.com/cp/med-annual-report/|title= Annual Report on Economic Relations between Italy and the Mediterranean |publisher=SRM}}&lt;/ref&gt; available online and printed also in paper format, which describes the overall picture of economic relations between Italy / Southern of Italy and Mediterranean.

==Awards and acknowledgments==

SRM received the [[Guido Dorso International Award]] in 2010. This plaque, given by the [[President of the Italian Republic]], is designated for a scientific - cultural institution of the South of Italy. It was awarded to the Association "in recognition of the intense and qualified activity carried out for a deeper knowledge of the southern territory".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

BBSRC is managed by the BBSRC Council consisting of a chairman (from 1 July 2009, Professor Sir [[Tom Blundell]]), a chief executive (Professor Melanie Welham) and from ten to eighteen representatives from UK universities, government and industry. The Council approves policies, strategy, budgets and major funding. On 11 February 2016, the Minister for Universities and Science, [[Jo Johnson]], announced the appointment of Professor Melanie Welham as interim Chief Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prof Melanie Welham appointed BBSRC Chief Executive|url=http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/news/people-skills-training/2016/160211-pr-melanie-welham-interim-bbsrc-chief-executive/|publisher=GOV.UK|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Welham was previously Executive Director of Science at BBSRC.

A Research Panel provides expert advice which BBSRC Council draws upon in making decisions. The purpose of the Research Panel is to advise on:

* the development and implementation of the Council's strategic plans
* the competitiveness, relevance, economic impact, and societal considerations of the science and innovation activities funded by BBSRC
* opportunities for partnership with national and international organisations

===Boards, panels and committees===
In addition to the Council and the Research Panel, BBSRC has a series of other internal bodies for specific purposes.

* Appointments Board
* Audit Board
* Remuneration Board
* Strategy Panels - eight Panels advise and report to the BBSRC Chief Executive
* Research Committees - five Committees award research grants in specific science areas

==Institutes of BBSRC==

The Council strategically funds eight research institutes in the UK, and a number of centres ([http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/organisation/institutes BBSRC: Institutes and centres]).

The Institutes are tasked with delivering innovative, world class bioscience research and training, leading to wealth and job creation, generating high returns for the UK economy.{{cn|date=October 2015}} They have strong links with business, industry and the wider community, and support policy development.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

The institutes' research underpins key sectors of the UK economy such as agriculture, bioenergy, biotechnology, food and drink and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the institutes maintain unique research facilities of national importance.

'''Blanchard's transsexualism typology''', also '''Blanchard autogynephilia theory''' and '''Blanchard's taxonomy''', is a [[psychological typology]] of male-to-female (MtF) [[transsexualism]] created by [[Ray Blanchard]] through the 1980s and 1990s, building on the work of his colleague, [[Kurt Freund]].  Blanchard divided [[trans women]] into two different groups: "[[homosexual transsexual]]s", who Blanchard says seek [[sex reassignment surgery]] because they are feminine in both behavior and appearance, and to romantically and sexually attract (ideally heterosexual) men, and "autogynephilic transsexuals" who purportedly are sexually aroused at the idea of having a female body. Blanchard's model is unusual in that neither groups are considered "false transsexuals"; both autogynephilic and homosexual transsexuals are thought to benefit from transition. This distinction is a recurring theme in scholarly literature on transsexualism.&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bancroft J|title=Human sexuality and its problems|pages =[https://books.google.com/books?id=bI–Jau14aLAC&amp;pg=PA290 290–1]| year = 2009 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] |isbn=978-0-443-05161-6 | chapter = Transgender gender nonconformity and transvestism | authorlink = John Bancroft (sexologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the theory include sexual behavior scientists [[J. Michael Bailey]], [[James Cantor]], [[Alice Dreger]], and some openly transgender health care providers, [[Anne Lawrence]] and Maxine Peterson, and others who say that there are significant differences between the two proposed groups, including sexuality, age of transition, ethnicity, IQ, fetishism, and quality of adjustment. Criticism of the research and theory has come from trans activists, including developmental biology researcher [[Julia Serano]], Jaimie Veale, Larry Nuttbrock, and some physicians, including Charles Allen Moser and [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]], and others who say that the theory is poorly representative of trans women.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt;

In the [[transgender]] community, the theory has been the subject of controversy, which peaked with the publication of Bailey's ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'' in 2003.

== History ==
The early history of the study of transsexualism is sparse; however, the concept of a categorization of transsexual people can be seen as early as 1923 with the work of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]].&lt;ref name="hirschfeld1923"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hirschfeld | first = M | authorlink =  Magnus Hirschfeld | year = 1923 | title = Die intersexuelle Konstitution | journal = Jahrbuch fuer sexuelle Zwischenstufen | pages = 3–27 | volume = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1966, [[Harry Benjamin]] wrote that researchers of his day thought that attraction to men, while feeling that oneself is a woman, was the factor that distinguished a transvestite from a transsexual.&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Benjamin H | authorlink = Harry Benjamin | year = 1966 | url = http://www.mut23.de/texte/Harry%20Benjamin%20-%20The%20Transsexual%20Phenomenon.pdf | format = PDF | title = The Transsexual Phenomenon | publisher = The Julian Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980 in the DSM-III, a  new diagnosis was introduced, that of "302.5 Transsexualism" under "Other Psychosexual Disorders". This was an attempt to provide a diagnostic category for [[gender identity disorder]]s.&lt;ref name="martin"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lothstein|first= Leslie Martin |title=Female-to-male transsexualism|publisher=Routledge |year=1983|page=60|isbn=0-7100-9476-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5HI9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=transsexual+%2B+DSM+III|access-date=2009-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnostic category, ''transsexualism'', was for [[gender dysphoria|gender dysphoric]] individuals who demonstrated at least two years of continuous interest in transforming their physical and social gender status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Walter |last=Meyer |author2=Walter O. Bockting |author3=Peggy Cohen-Kettenis |title=The Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association's Standards Of Care For Gender Identity Disorders, Sixth Version |version=6th |publisher=Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association |date=February 2001 |url=http://www.wpath.org/Documents2/socv6.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=2009-04-22 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610012909/http://www.wpath.org/Documents2/socv6.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtypes were asexual, homosexual (same "biological sex"), heterosexual (other "biological sex") and unspecified.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt;  This was removed in the DSM-IV, in which gender identity disorder replaced transsexualism. Previous taxonomies, or systems of categorization, used the terms ''classic transsexual'' or ''true transsexual'', terms once used in [[differential diagnosis|differential diagnoses]].&lt;ref name="benjamin1966"/&gt;

The clinical literature of Freund, Blanchard, and others has consistently divided male-to-female transsexuals into two distinct groups - "homosexual transsexuals," people who are sexually attracted to (ideally heterosexual) men and supposedly desire a normative female body to attract them, and "heterosexual fetishistic transvestites" in which the transsexual purportedly finds the idea of having a normative female body sexually arousing but desires a heterosexual female partner.&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009" /&gt;  Kurt Freund first distinguished between these two proposed types in a 1982 research article, theorizing that the "homosexual" transsexuals were qualitatively different from the so-called "heterosexual males" with gender dysphoria.&lt;ref name="freund1982"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Freund K, Steiner BW, Chan S|date=February 1982|title=Two types of cross-gender identity|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=11|issue=1|pages=49–63|doi=10.1007/BF01541365|pmid=7073469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexologist [[Ray Blanchard]] coined the term "autogynephilia" in 1989 to describe this latter category of people.&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009" /&gt;  He stated that while they lacked a specific term to describe the concept, there was evidence for the concept among clinicians of the early 20th century.  [[Havelock Ellis]] used the terms ''eonism'' and ''sexo-aesthetic inversion'' in 1913 to describe similar cross-gender feelings and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Blanchard2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=August 2005|title=Early history of the concept of autogynephilia|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=34|issue=4|pages=439–46|doi=10.1007/s10508-005-4343-8|pmid=16010466}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2005 article on the concept by Ray Blanchard noted that [[Kurt Freund|Freund]] was probably the first author to distinguish between the erotic arousal due to dressing as a woman ([[transvestism]]) versus erotic arousal due to physically transforming into a more typically female form (autogynephilia).&lt;ref name="Blanchard2005" /&gt;

=== Development ===
Blanchard's observations at the Clarke Institute began by categorizing male-to-female transsexuals into four groups based off their supposed sexual orientations: "homosexual," "heterosexual," bisexual, and [[analloerotic]]s (i.e. trans women attracted to men, women, both, or neither, respectively.)&lt;ref name="Blanchard1985"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=June 1985|title=Typology of male-to-female transsexualism|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=14|issue=3|pages=247–61|doi=10.1007/bf01542107|pmid=4004548}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=October 1989|title=The concept of autogynephilia and the typology of male gender dysphoria|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=177|issue=10|pages=616–23|doi=10.1097/00005053-198910000-00004|pmid=2794988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard then conducted a series of studies on people [[assigned male at birth]] with gender dysphoria, including male-to-female transsexual people, and concluded that there existed only two distinct types.&lt;ref name="Blanchard1985" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchardetal1987"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R, Clemmensen LH, Steiner BW|date=April 1987|title=Heterosexual and homosexual gender dysphoria|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=16|issue=2|pages=139–52|doi=10.1007/BF01542067|pmid=3592961}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blanchard said that one type of gender dysphoria/transsexualism manifests itself in individuals who are exclusively attracted to men (Homosexual transsexuals averaged a [[Kinsey scale]] measurement of 5-6  and six is the maximum, or a 9.86±2.37 on the [[Modified Androphilia Scale]]&lt;ref name="lawrence2005"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lawrence AA, Latty EM, Chivers ML, Bailey JM|date=April 2005|title=Measurement of sexual arousal in postoperative male-to-female transsexuals using vaginal photoplethysmography|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~sexlab/files/pubs/Lawrenceetal2005.pdf|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=34|issue=2|pages=135–45|doi=10.1007/s10508-005-1792-z|pmid=15803248}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="leavitt1990"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Leavitt F, Berger JC|date=October 1990|title=Clinical patterns among male transsexual candidates with erotic interest in males|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=19|issue=5|pages=491–505|doi=10.1007/BF02442350|pmid=2260914}}&lt;/ref&gt;), whom he referred to as ''homosexual transsexuals'', adopting Freund's terminology.&lt;ref name="Blanchardetal1987" /&gt; The other type he defined as including those who are attracted to females (gynephilic), attracted to both males and females (bisexual), and attracted to neither males nor females (''analloerotic'' or asexual); Blanchard referred to this latter set collectively as the ''non-homosexual transsexuals''.&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989class"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=August 1989|title=The classification and labeling of nonhomosexual gender dysphorias|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=18|issue=4|pages=315–34|doi=10.1007/BF01541951|pmid=2673136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1988"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|date=January 1988|title=Nonhomosexual gender dysphoria|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=24|issue=1|pages=188–93|doi=10.1080/00224498809551410|pmid=22375647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard says that the "non-homosexual" transsexuals (but not the "homosexual" transsexuals) exhibit ''autogynephilia'',&lt;ref name="Blanchardetal1987" /&gt; which he defined as a [[paraphilia|paraphilic]] interest in having female anatomy.&lt;ref name="Blanchard1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Blanchard1991"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blanchard R|year=1991|title=Clinical observations and systematic studies of autogynephilia|journal=Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy|volume=17|issue=4|pages=235–51|doi=10.1080/00926239108404348|pmc=|pmid=1815090}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bailey2003"&gt;Bailey, J.

Studies usually find that some number of non-homosexual transsexual report having no autogynephilia.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; When developing the typology, Blanchard found that gynephilic gender identity patients who reported never experiencing arousal to crossdressing were still measurably aroused by autogynephilic stimuli, and that autogynephilia among non-androphilic trans women was negatively associated with tendency to color their narrative to be more socially acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men Trapped in Men's Bodies|last=Lawrence|first=Anne|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Blanchard to conclude that non-homosexual trans women who reported no autogynephilic interests were misrepresenting their stories. This conclusion has been criticized for being [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]]&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; and for being based on an incorrect way of measuring autogynephilia.&lt;ref name="moser2010" /&gt;

== Terminology ==
Within the typology, sexual orientation terms are usually used relative to biological sex. That is, "homosexual" refers to those attracted exclusively to men, while "non-homosexual" refers to those who are attracted to other people than men or who are attracted to neither men nor women. "Homosexual" is used this way partly because of the scientific precedent. One of the types of transsexuals described within the theory is known as homosexual transsexuals. They are thought to be fundamentally the same phenomenon as the most feminine gay men. This similarity between homosexual transsexuals and homosexual men is also part of the reason why "homosexual" is used relative to biological sex.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The word "autogynephilia" refers to a propensity to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of one self as a woman. This paraphilia is related to [[transvestic fetishism]].

== Theory ==
The typology divides male-to-female transsexuals into two groups: homosexual and autogynephilic. Homosexual transsexuals are thought of as being extremely feminine gay men, while autogynephilic transsexuals are thought to be sexually attracted to the image of themselves as women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Attraction to the image of oneself as a woman is called ''autogynephilia''. The homosexual type corresponds to what is known as early-onset in other sources, while the autogynephilic type corresponds to what is known as late-onset in other sources. Homosexual transsexuals are proposed to be motivated by being very feminine in both behavior and appearance, and by a desire to romantically and sexually attract (ideally very masculine) men. Autogynephilic transsexuals are thought to be motivated by their sexual desire and romantic love for being women.&lt;ref name="LawrenceBecoming" /&gt;

Homosexual transsexuals are very feminine from a young age. According to Bailey and Zucker, non-transgender gay men are also often very feminine when young, but usually learn to live in a more masculine role when they grow up. They argue that homosexual transsexuals differ because they encounter early adversity that prevented them from defeminizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay men find the femininity of homosexual transsexuals very unattractive,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=76-79}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the homosexual transsexuals themselves are very attracted to masculinity that they have trouble finding in gay men. As a result, homosexual transsexuals may be partially motivated by a desire to attract straight men.

Autogynephiles have sexual fantasies about being women. These fantasies may focus on a variety of things associated with womanhood, such as anatomy, clothing or behavior. Blanchard found that the specific form the autogynephilia takes on correlates with the likelihood of transition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Erotic target location errors ===
{{See also|Erotic target location error|Furry fandom|Paraphilic infantilism}}
Ray Blanchard conjectured that autogynephilia is a misdirected form of heterosexuality, with the attraction to women being redirected towards the self instead of others. These forms of erotic target location errors have also been observed with other base orientations than gynephilia, such as pedophilia, [[acrotomophilia]] and attraction to plush animals. Anne Lawrence argued that these phenomena provide further support for autogynephilia theory:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe that the existence of these analogs of autogynephilic transsexualism calls into question the most influential biological and psychoanalytic theories of nonhomosexual MtF transsexualism, because such theories should also be able to account for these analogous phenomena but cannot easily do so. For example: It is plausible that hormonal abnormalities during prenatal development could result in a male-bodied person with a brain that had developed in a female-typical direction. It is less plausible that a prenatal developmental disturbance could result in a male-bodied person with a brain that had developed like that of an amputee or a plush animal. [...]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I consider it more parsimonious to theorize that autogynephilic MtF transsexualism and the analogous conditions that exist in men who are sexually attracted to children, amputees, plush animals, and perhaps real animals, all represent manifestations of an unusual type of paraphilia in which affected men feel sexually aroused by the idea of impersonating or becoming whatever category of person or thing they find sexually attractive. Their paraphilic desires, in turn, often give rise to strongly held, highly valued alternative identities that ultimately become their dominant identities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Autopedophiles have been found to be more likely than other pedophiles to have considered whether they would be better off as a child, and more likely to have considered hormones or surgery to look more like a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu KJ, Bailey JM | title = Autopedophilia | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 115–123 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27899472 | doi = 10.1177/0956797616677082 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autogynephilic vs. homosexual transsexuals ===
By definition, autogynephilic transsexuals are autogynephilic while homosexual transsexuals are androphilic. However, a number of other differences between the types have been found. Under the theory, homosexual transsexuals are predicted to begin transitioning earlier in life,&lt;ref name="onesixtytwo"&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; generally before turning 30, which accounts for their supposedly better adjustment. They are also more likely to come from poorer, non-white or immigrant backgrounds,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 179, 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt; have lower IQs,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as be by definition exclusively attracted to men. Autogynephilic transsexuals are either attracted to women, exclusively or not, or [[asexuality|asexual]].&lt;ref name="onesixtytwo" /&gt; They are also said under the theory to display more fetishistic or otherwise [[paraphilic]] arousal.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Lawrence has proposed that autogynephilic transsexuals are more excited about [[Sex reassignment surgery|sexual reassignment surgery]] than homosexual transsexuals. She finds that homosexual transsexuals are typically ambivalent or indifferent about SRS, while autogynephilic transsexuals want to have surgery as quickly as possible, are happy to be rid of their penis, and proud of their new genitals.&lt;ref name="LawrenceBecoming" /&gt; Michael Bailey argued that homosexual transsexuals are unlikely to transition if their appearance as women would be very unattractive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Man Who Would Be Queen|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transsexuals who are active on the internet and in transsexual support groups are overwhelmingly autogynephilic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence AA, Bailey JM | title = Transsexual groups in Veale et al.

Autogynephilia is most notable for its use in Blanchard's taxonomy to explain the presence of [[gender dysphoria]] in "non-homosexual" ([[gynephilia|gynephilic]]) [[male-to-female transsexual]]s, in contrast to the  gender dysphoria observed in "homosexual" ([[androphilia|androphilic]]) transsexuals.  Autogynephilia has also been suggested to pertain to romantic love as well as to sexual arousal patterns.&lt;ref name="LawrenceBecoming"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence AA | title = Becoming what we love: autogynephilic transsexualism conceptualized as an expression of romantic love | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 506–20 | date = 2007-10-24 | pmid = 17951885 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2007.0050 | url = http://www.annelawrence.com/becoming_what_we_love.pdf | publisher = Elsevier | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest sexual fantasy he could recall was that of having a woman's body. When he masturbated, he would imagine that he was a nude woman lying alone in her bed. His mental imagery would focus on his breasts, his vagina, the softness of his skin, and so on—all the characteristic features of the female physique. This remained his favorite sexual fantasy throughout his life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Sexuality ===
According to Blanchard, "An autogynephile does not necessarily become sexually aroused every time he pictures himself as female or engages in feminine behavior, any more than a heterosexual man automatically gets an erection whenever he sees an attractive woman. Thus, the concept of autogynephilia—like that of heterosexuality, homosexuality, or pedophilia—refers to a ''potential'' for sexual excitation"&lt;ref name="Blanchard1991" /&gt; [emphasis in original].

Blanchard classified four subtypes of autogynephilic sexual fantasies, but noted that "All four types of autogynephilia tend to occur in combination with other types rather than alone."&lt;ref name="Blanchard1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="blanchard1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = Varieties of autogynephilia and their relationship to gender dysphoria | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–51 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8494491 | doi = 10.1007/bf01541769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Transvestic autogynephilia: arousal to the act or fantasy of wearing typically feminine clothing
*Behavioral autogynephilia: arousal to the act or fantasy of doing something regarded as feminine
*Physiologic autogynephilia: arousal to fantasies of body functions specific to people regarded as female
*Anatomic autogynephilia: arousal to the fantasy of having a normative woman's body, or parts of one

Other authors have distinguished between behavioral autogynephilia and interpersonal gynephilia, with the latter being arousal to being seen or admired as a woman or having sex with men.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu KJ, Rosenthal AM, Bailey JM | title = The Psychometric Structure of Items Assessing Autogynephilia | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 1301–12 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 25277693 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-014-0397-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There also exist male assigned at birth people who report being sexually aroused by the image or idea of having ''some'' but not ''all'' normative female anatomy, such as having breasts but retaining their penis and testicles; Blanchard referred to this phenomenon as ''partial autogynephilia.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = The she-male phenomenon and the concept of partial autogynephilia | journal = Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–76 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8468711 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1080/00926239308404889 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = Partial versus complete autogynephilia and gender dysphoria | journal = Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–7 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8308916 | doi = 10.1080/00926239308404373 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autogynephilia has been linked to [[Gynandromorphophilia|attraction to transgender women]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hsu KJ, Rosenthal AM, Miller DI, Bailey JM | title = Sexual Arousal Patterns of Autogynephilic Male Cross-Dressers | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 247–253 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27620319 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-016-0826-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; Autogynephilic men are usually attracted to women and not to men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been proposed that autogynephiles who report being attracted to men are instead experiencing pseudo-bisexuality or pseudo-androphilia, an interpersonal autogynephilic desire for men as part of the fantasy about being a woman.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===DSM-5===
In [[DSM-5]], published in 2013, ''With autogynephilia'' (sexual arousal by thoughts, images of self as a female) is a specifier to '''302.3 [[Transvestic disorder]]''' (intense sexual arousal from cross-dressing fantasies, urges or behaviors); the other specifier is  ''With [[fetishism]]'' (sexual arousal to fabrics, materials or garments).&lt;ref name="DSM-5-paraphillic"&gt;{{Cite book | last= American Psychiatric Association | year= 2013 | title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders | edition=Fifth | publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing | location=Arlington, VA | pages=685–705 | isbn= 978-0-89042-555-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender dysphoria ===
{{See also|Causes of transsexuality}}
Blanchard found that anatomic autogynephilia was more associated with gender dysphoria than transvestic autogynephilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blanchard R | title = Varieties of autogynephilia and their relationship to gender dysphoria | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–51 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8494491 | doi = 10.1007/bf01541769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Men Trapped in Men's Bodies: Narratives of Autogynephilic Transsexualism|last=Lawrence|first=Anne|publisher=Springer|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4614-5181-5|location=|pages=22-23, 24-26, 140-142, 155-156}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different pattern was found in a sample of non-transgender autogynephilic men, where higher degrees of anatomic autogynephilia were associated with less gender dysphoria; here, it was instead interpersonal and physiological autogynephilia that predicted gender dysphoria. The men in this sample were significantly more gender dysphoric than the non-transgender male baseline.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Autogynephilia in cisgender women ===
Two studies have tested the possibility that cisgender women can also experience autogynephilia. Veale and colleagues (2008) found that an online sample of cisgender women commonly endorsed items on adapted versions of Blanchard's autogynephilia scales.&lt;ref name="veale2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Veale JF, Clarke DE, Lomax TC | title = Sexuality of male-to-female transsexuals | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 4 | pages = 586–97 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18299976 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9306-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moser (2009) created an ''Autogynephilia Scale for Women'' based on items used to categorize MtF transsexuals as autogynephilic in other studies. A questionnaire that included the ASW was distributed to a sample of 51 professional women employed at an urban hospital; 29 completed questionnaires were returned for analysis. By the common definition of ever having erotic arousal to the thought or image of oneself as a woman, 93% of the respondents would be classified as autogynephilic. Using a more rigorous definition of "frequent" arousal to multiple items, 28% would be classified as autogynephilic.&lt;ref name="pmid19591032" /&gt; However, Anne Lawrence criticized these studies' methodology and conclusions and asserted that genuine autogynephilia occurs very rarely, if ever, in natal women.&lt;ref name="pmid20069491"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence AA | title = Something resembling autogynephilia in women: comment on Moser (2009) | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 57 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20069491 | doi = 10.1080/00918360903445749 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Her comment was rebutted by Moser who said that she had made multiple errors by comparing the wrong items.&lt;ref name="PMID20582797"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moser C | title = A rejoinder to Lawrence (2010): it helps if you compare the correct items. | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 693–696 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20582797| doi = 10.1080/00918369.2010.485859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One case of anatomic autoandrophilia has been reported in an adult male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawrence AA | title = Anatomic autoandrophilia in an adult male | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 1050–6 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19093196 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9446-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The concept received attention when sex researcher and trans woman [[Anne Lawrence]] described it on her website in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="lawrence1998"&gt;{{cite web | last = Lawrence | first = AA | url = http://home.swipnet.se/~w-13968/autogynephilia.html | title = Men Trapped in Men's Bodies:An Introduction to the Concept of Autogynephilia | date = 1998-10-01 | access-date = 2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2003, when Bailey published ''The Man Who Would Be Queen'', in which he based his portrayal of male-to-female transsexual people on Blanchard's taxonomy, an enormous controversy resulted.&lt;ref name="Dreger2008" /&gt;

Jaimie Veale gathered a convenience sample over the Internet of trans women's impressions of and opinions on Blanchard's typology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Veale J, Clark DE, Lomax TC  |date=2012|title=Male-to-female transsexuals’ impressions of Blanchard’s autogynephilia theory | journal = International Journal of Transgenderism |volume=13|issue=3|pages=131–139|doi=10.1080/15532739.2011.669659 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the people answering the survey, 52.5% had a negative response.  Of the 170 respondents, 33 said the typology was too narrow and restrictive, 15 said it did not apply to their experiences, and 5 that the typology was driven by questionable motives such as "to encourage 'elitist divisionism'."  Other participants, however, said they did, in fact, experience autogynephilia.

Criticism of the theory of "homosexual transsexuals" is generally focused in two categories: the use of the terms "homosexual" and "non-homosexual" to refer to MtF transsexuals by their assigned sex&lt;ref name="bagemihl"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bagemihl | first = B | chapter = Surrogate phonology and transsexual faggotry: A linguistic analogy for uncoupling sexual orientation from gender identity | title = Queerly Phrased: Language, Gender, and Sexuality | editors = Livia A; Hall K : | page = 380 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 0-19-510471-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benjamin"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benjamin |first=Harry |title=The Transsexual Phenomenon |location=Chapter 2, Paragraph 16 |url=http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/chap_02.htm#Relationship%20to%20homosexuality |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913065950/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/chap_02.htm |archive-date=September 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the data underlying the theory itself.&lt;ref name="pmid19591032"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moser C | title = Autogynephilia in women | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 56 | issue = 5 | pages = 539–47 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19591032 | doi = 10.1080/00918360903005212 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="veale2008" /&gt; Harry Benjamin, in his seminal work ''The Transsexual Phenomenon'', opined that the question "is a transsexual homosexual?" had both "yes" and "no" answers depending on whether sexual anatomy or [[gender identity]] was prioritised, and in cases of post-operative male-to-female transsexuals, describing them as "homosexual men" was against "common sense and reason".&lt;ref name="Benjamin" /&gt; The terminology has also been described as confusing and controversial among transsexuals seeking sexual reassignment,&lt;ref name="leavitt1990" /&gt; archaic,&lt;ref name="wahng"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wahng | first = SJ | year = 2004 | chapter = Transmasculinity and Asian American Gendering | editors = Aldama AJ | title =Violence and the Body: Race, Gender, and the State | publisher = [[Indiana University Press]] | isbn = 0-253-34171-X | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=aCH6zsDB5mkC&amp;pg=PA292#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 292]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=aCH6zsDB5mkC&amp;pg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 307n8] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and demeaning.&lt;ref name="leiblum2000"&gt;{{cite book | last = Leiblum | first = SR |author2=Rosen RC | year = 2000 | title = Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy | edition = 3rd | isbn = 1-57230-574-6 | publisher = [[Guilford Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 sexologist [[John Bancroft (sexologist)|John Bancroft]] expressed regret for having used this terminology, which was standard when he used it, to refer to transsexual women, and that he now tries to use words more sensitively.&lt;ref name="Bancroftcomment"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bancroft J | title = Lust or identity? | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 426–8; discussion 505-10 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18431640 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9317-1 | publisher = Springer | authorlink = John Bancroft (sexologist) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Moser, a sexuality advocate, criticized Blanchard's theory, stating that it uses an overly-broad definition of autogynephilia, is not sufficiently relevant to MtF transsexual patients, fails to account for all information on sexual and romantic interests of homosexual and transsexual people, and lacks supporting data.&lt;ref name="moser2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moser C | title = Blanchard's Autogynephilia Theory: a critique | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 57 | issue = 6 | pages = 790–809 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20582803 | doi = 10.1080/00918369.2010.486241 | edition = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaimie Veale, a psychology academic, published an alternative theory in 2010 which proposes that variances in gender identity are driven by personality and social factors which determine whether psychological [[defense mechanism]]s are employed to avoid or repress gender nonconformity, resulting in the later expression of this gender nonconformity.&lt;ref name="veale2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Veale JF, Lomax T, Clarke D | doi = 10.1080/15532739.2010.514217 | title = Identity-Defense Model of Gender-Variant Development | journal = International Journal of Transgenderism | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 125–138 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Serano]], a trans activist, wrote that there were flaws in Blanchard's original papers, including that they were conducted among overlapping populations primarily at the [[Clarke Institute]] in [[Toronto]] without nontranssexual controls, that the subtypes were not empirically derived but instead were "[[begging the question]] that transsexuals fall into subtypes based on their sexual orientation," and that further research had found a non-deterministic correlation between cross-gender arousal and sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="serano"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Serano | first1 = J. M. | title = The Case Against Autogynephilia | url = http://www.juliaserano.com/av/Serano-CaseAgainstAutogynephilia.pdf | doi = 10.1080/15532739.2010.514223 | journal = International Journal of Transgenderism | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 176–187 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that Blanchard did not discuss the idea that cross-gender arousal may be an effect, rather than a cause, of gender dysphoria, and that Blanchard assumed that [[correlation does not imply causation|correlation implied causation]].&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; Serano also stated that the wider idea of cross-gender arousal was affected by the prominence of [[sexual objectification]] of women, accounting for both a relative lack of cross-gender arousal in transsexual men and similar patterns of autogynephilic arousal in non-transsexual women.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; Serano criticised proponents of the theory, claiming that they dismiss non-autogynephilic, non-androphilic transsexuals as misreporting or lying while not questioning androphilic transsexuals, describing it as "tantamount to hand-picking which evidence counts and which does not based upon how well it conforms to the model",&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; either making the theory unscientific due to its unfalsifiability, or invalid due to the nondeterministic correlation that later studies found.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt; Further criticisms alleged that the theory undermined lived experience of transsexual women, contributed to pathologisation and sexualisation of transsexual women, and the literature itself fed into the stereotype of transsexuals as "purposefully deceptive", which could be used to justify discrimination and violence against transsexuals.&lt;ref name="serano" /&gt;

T. M. Bettcher, based on her own experience as a trans woman, has critiqued the notion of "autogynephilia," and "target errors" generally, within a framework of "erotic structuralism," arguing that the notion conflates essential distinctions between "source of attraction" and "erotic content," and "(erotic) interest" and "(erotic) attraction," thus misinterpreting what she prefers to call, following Serano, "female embodiment eroticism." She maintains that not only is "an erotic interest in oneself as a gendered being," as she puts it, a non-pathological and indeed necessary component of regular sexual attraction to others, but within the framework of erotic structuralism, a "misdirected" attraction to oneself as postulated by Blanchard is outright nonsensical.&lt;ref name="Bettcher2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bettcher TM | title = When selves have sex: what the phenomenology of trans sexuality can teach about sexual orientation | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 605–20 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24295078 | doi = 10.1080/00918369.2014.865472 | url = https://www.academia.edu/5300966/When_Selves_Have_Sex_What_The_Phenomenology_of_Trans_Sexuality_Can_Teach_About_Sexual_Orientation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Misgendering language ===
According to Leavitt and Berger (1990), "Transsexuals, as a group, vehemently oppose the [[homosexual transsexual]] label and its pejorative baggage (Morgan, 1978).  As a rule, they are highly invested in a heterosexual life-style and are repulsed by notions of homosexual relations with males. Attention from males often serves to validate their feminine status."&lt;ref name="leavitt1990" /&gt;

Trans man [[Aaron Devor]] wrote, "If what we really mean to say is attracted to males, then say 'attracted to males' or androphilic... I see absolutely no reason to continue with language that people find offensive when there is perfectly serviceable, in fact better, language that is not offensive."&lt;ref name="lane2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lane R | title = Truth, lies, and trans science | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 453–6; discussion 505-10 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18431622 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s10508-008-9336-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other transsexual people are opposed to any and all models of diagnosis which allow medical professionals to prevent anyone from changing their sex, and seek their removal from the DSM.&lt;ref name="shefer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Psychology|last=Shefer|first=Tamara|last2=Boonzaier|first2=Floretta | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=Juta and Company Limited|year=2006|isbn=978-1-919713-92-2|edition=Illustrated|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jtiUvdDlTboC&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 273–4]; [https://books.google.com/books?id=jtiUvdDlTboC&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 282]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accusations of misconduct ===
Trans activist [[Lynn Conway]] blogged extensively about the publication of Bailey's book by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] and along with other activists accused Bailey of misconduct. [[Northwestern University]] investigated Bailey, but did not reveal the findings of that investigation and did not comment on whether or not Bailey had been punished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wilson | first = R | url = http://chronicle.com/article/Northwestern-U-Concludes/103078/ | title = Northwestern U. Concludes Investigation of Sex Researcher but Keeps Results Secret | publisher = [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date = 2004-12-10 | access-date = 2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a summary of the controversy written by Northwestern University [[bioethicist]] and historian [[Alice Dreger]], the accusations were unfounded and comprised an attempt by those activists to silence Bailey for expressing views that contrasted with the public image they wanted.  The accusations themselves did not hold up to scrutiny, according to Dreger's analysis.  For example, two of the four transsexual women who accused Bailey of misusing their stories in the book were not actually mentioned in the book at all.&lt;ref name=Dreger2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dreger AD | title = The controversy surrounding "The man who would be queen": a case history of the politics of science, identity, and sex in the Internet age | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 366–421 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18431641 | pmc = 3170124 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9301-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreger studied the reactions of trans activists and other controversies in her 2015 book ''[[Galileo's Middle Finger]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2015"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's middle finger: heretics, activists, and the search for justice in science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that although the science appears correct that eroticism is behind the typology of transgenderism, activists in the trans community preferred the simpler narrative of literally being one sex trapped in the body of the other.  Dreger says, "Autogynephilia is perhaps best understood as a love that would really rather we didn’t speak its name",&lt;ref name="autogenerated2015"/&gt; in reference to the famous expression ''[[the love that dare not speak its name]]'' formerly used to refer to homosexuality or [[pederasty]].

CS50 lectures are recorded and uploaded to several services including [[iTunes U]], edX (where it is known as CS50x), and YouTube. Additional video "walkthroughs" are recorded with professors and volunteer students. Course questions, called problem sets, or "psets" for short, are available in both PDF and HTML format. Students can upload problem set answers, and some questions are graded by automation. Students can also use special software to check their code in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]. In 2016, CS50 became the first university course to offer students the possibility to watch all lectures entirely in [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CS50 Moves Away from Traditional Lectures, Toward Virtual Reality|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/31/CS50-moves-from-lectures/|website=The Crimson|date=2016-08-31|author=Fahs, C.

==History==

===The road to the CLS: 1972–1999===
[[Image:CSRF Grasshopper.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[monochromator]] from the first CSRF beamline, now a museum piece at the CLS]]
[[Image:SAL LINAC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The SAL LINAC, seen at the CLS in 2011]]

Canadian interest in [[synchrotron radiation]] dates from 1972, when Bill McGowan of the [[University of Western Ontario]] (UWO) organised a workshop on its uses. At that time there were no users of synchrotron radiation in Canada. In 1973 McGowan submitted an unsuccessful proposal to the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC) for a feasibility study on a possible synchrotron lightsource in Canada. In 1975 a proposal to build a dedicated synchrotron lightsource in Canada was submitted to NRC. This was also unsuccessful. In 1977 [[G. Michael Bancroft|Mike Bancroft]], also of UWO, submitted a proposal to NRC to build a Canadian [[beamline]], as the [[Canadian Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (CSRF), at the existing [[Synchrotron Radiation Center]] at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], USA, and in 1978 newly created [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council|NSERC]] awarded capital funding. CSRF, owned and operated by NRC, grew from the initial beamline to a total of three by 1998.

A further push towards a Canadian synchrotron light source started in 1990 with formation of the Canadian Institute for Synchrotron Radiation (CISR), initiated by Bruce Bigham of [[AECL]]. AECL and [[TRIUMF]] showed interest in designing the ring, but the [[Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory]] (SAL) at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] became prominent in the design. In 1991 CISR submitted a proposal to NSERC for a final design study.  This was turned down, but in later years, under President Peter Morand, NSERC became more supportive. In 1994 NSERC committee recommended a Canadian synchrotron light source and a further NSERC committee was formed to select between two bids to host such a facility, from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Western Ontario. In 1996 this committee recommended that the Canadian Light Source be built in Saskatchewan.

With NSERC unable to supply the required funds it was not clear where funding would come from. In 1997 the [[Canada Foundation for Innovation]] (CFI) was created to fund large scientific projects, possibly to provide a mechanism to fund the CLS. In 1998 a University of Saskatchewan team led by [http://awards.usask.ca/faculty/recipients/skopik.php Dennis Skopik], the SAL director, submitted a proposal to CFI.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"&gt;{{Cite journal
|last=Bancroft |first=G. M.

|title=The Canadian Light Source – History and scientific prospects

|doi=10.1139/v04-027   
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was to fund 40% of the construction costs, with remaining money having to come from elsewhere. Assembling these required matching funds has been called "an unprecedented level of collaboration among governments, universities, and industry in Canada"&lt;ref name="SPHistory"&gt;[http://media.cns-snc.ca/history/Canadian_Light_Source.html "Synchrotron: Canadian Light Source 70 years in the making'"],''The Star-Phoenix'' 20 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and Bancroft – leader of the rival UWO bid – anckowledged the "Herculean" efforts of the Saskatchewan team in obtaining funds from the University, the City of Saskatoon, [[Saskatchewan Power]], NRC, the Provincial Government of Saskatchewan, and [[Western Economic Diversification]].&lt;ref name="Bancroft"/&gt; At a late hour CFI told the proponents that it would not accept the SAL [[LINAC]] as part of the proposal, and the resulting shortfall was met in part by the spontaneous announcement by the Saskatoon city council and then Mayor [[Henry Dayday]] that they would double their contribution as long as other partners would. On 31 March 1999 the success of the CFI proposal was announced.

The following month Skopik took a position at [[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility|Jefferson Lab]] in the USA. He decided not to stay on as director of the Saskatoon facility because his expertise was in subatomic particles, and, he argued, the head of the CLS should be a researcher who specializes in using such a facility. His successor was Mike Bancroft&lt;ref name="SPHistory" /&gt;

===Construction: 1999–2004===

At the start of the project, all staff members with the former SAL were transferred into a new [[nonprofit organization|not-for-profit]] corporation, Canadian
Light Source Inc., CLSI, which had primary responsibility for the technical design, construction and operation of the facility. As a separate corporation from the University, CLSI had the legal and organizational freedom suitable for this responsibility. UMA, an experienced engineering firm, now part of [[AECOM]], with extensive experience managing large technical and civil construction projects, was hired as [[project management|project managers]].&lt;ref name="CLSI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/papers/weilh04.pdf|title=Industrial involvement in the construction of synchrotron lightsources| year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new building – attached to the existing SAL building, and measuring 84m by 83m in area with a maximum height of 23m – was completed in early 2001.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"/&gt; The footprint of the CLS has been described as equivalent to that of a football field.&lt;ref name="Reinvent" /&gt;

Bancroft's appointment ended in October 2001 and he returned to UWO, with Mark de Jong appointed acting director. Bancroft remained as acting Scientific Director until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightsource.ca/enews/newsletter_October2001.php CLS Newsletter October 2001 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the CLS Project was awarded the National Award for Exceptional Engineering Achievement by the [[Canadian Council of Professional Engineers]].&lt;ref name="Engaward"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.lightsource.ca/media/synchrotronaward.php| title=U of S-Owned Synchrotron Project Wins National Engineering Award  | date=27 May 2002| accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SAL LINAC was refurbished and placed back into service in 2002 while the booster and storage rings were still under construction.&lt;ref name="Bancroft"/&gt; First turn was achieved in the booster ring in July 2002 with full booster commissioning completed by September 2002.&lt;ref name="booster"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/PAPERS/THPKF025.PDF |title=Commissioning report of the CLS booster synchrotron | year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New director Bill Thomlinson, an expert in synchrotron medical imaging, arrived in November 2002. He was recruited from the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] where he had been the head of the medical research group.&lt;ref name="Thom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/02-aug-09/news17.shtml | title=Thomlinson to head CLS Nov. 1| date=9 August 2002 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1991 proposal to NSERC envisioned a 1.5 GeV storage ring, since at this time the interest of the user community was mainly in the soft X-ray range. The ring was a racetrack layout of four to six [[dipole magnet|bend]] regions surrounding straights with extra [[quadrupole magnets|quadrupoles]] to allow for variable functions in the straights. The design contemplated the use of [[superconductivity|superconducting]] bends in some locations to boost
the [[photon]] energies produced. The drawback of this design was the limited number of straight sections. In 1994 a more conventional machine with 8 straight sections was proposed, again with 1.5 GeV energy. At this time more users of hard X-rays were interested and it was felt that both the energy and number of straight sections were too low. By the time funding was secured in 1999 the design had changed to 2.9 GeV, with longer straight sections to enable two [[insertion devices]] per straight, delivering beam to two independent beamlines.&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/p03/PAPERS/TOPA001.PDF| title=The Canadian Light Source | year=2003 | format=PDF | accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the storage ring was completed in August 2003 and commissioning began the following month. Although beam could be stored, in March 2004 a large obstruction was found across the center of the chamber. Commissioning proceeded quickly after this was removed, and by June 2004 currents of 100mA could be achieved .&lt;ref name="comm"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/Accelconf/e04/PAPERS/THPKF007.PDF | title=Canadian Light Source status and commissioning results | year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 October 2004 the CLS officially opened, with an opening ceremony attended by federal and provincial dignitaries, including then-Federal [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] [[Ralph Goodale]] and then-[[Premier of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan Premier]] [[Lorne Calvert]], university presidents and leading scientists. October 2004 was declared "Synchrotron Month" by the city of Saskatoon and the Saskatchewan government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/04-sep-24/news07.shtml|title= October declared Synchrotron Month |date=24 September 2004 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Mansbridge]] broadcast the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s nightly [[newscast]] [[The National (CBC)|''The National'']] from the top of the storage ring the day before the official opening.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.usask.ca/archived_ocn/04-nov-05/news01.shtml| title=Dignitaries gather to mark synchrotron's grand opening| date=5 November 2004| accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Parliament of Canada|parliament]] local [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Lynne Yelich]] said "There were many challenges to overcome, but thanks to the vision, dedication and persistence of its supporters, the Canadian Light Source synchrotron is open for business in Saskatoon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://openparliament.ca/debates/2004/10/21/lynne-yelich-1/only/|title= Lynne Yelich on Canadian Light Source |date=21 October 2004 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation and expansion: 2005–2012===
[[Image:CLS in 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The CLS building in 2008, with the expansion for the BMIT beamline on the left]]
[[Image:Brockhouse construction.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The expansion for the Brockhouse beamlines under construction in July 2012]]
The initial funding included seven beamlines, referred to as Phase I, which covered the full spectral range: two [[infrared]] beamlines, three soft X-ray beamlines and two hard X-ray beamlines.&lt;ref name="Bancroft" /&gt; Further beamlines were built in two further phases, II (7 beamlines) and III (5 beamlines), announced in 2004 and 2006 respectively. Most of these were funded through applications to CFI by individual universities including UWO, the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Guelph University]]&lt;ref name="progress" /&gt;

In March 2005 leading infrared researcher Tom Ellis joined the CLS from [[Acadia University]] as Director of Research. He had previously spent 16 years at the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://announcements.usask.ca/news/archive/2005/03/leading_scienti.html |title=Leading Scientist Recruited as Research Director for Canadian Light Source at the U of S |date=1 March 2005 |accessdate=28 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409000406/http://announcements.usask.ca/news/archive/2005/03/leading_scienti.html |archivedate=9 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first external user was hosted in 2005, and the first research papers with results from the CLS were published in March 2006 – one from the University of Saskatchewan on [[peptide]]s and the other from the University of Western Ontario on materials for [[OLED|organic light-emitting diodes]].&lt;ref name="Flow"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/local/story.html?id=7799751a-5551-44c7-aa98-439657b83dad| title=Research results begin to flow from synchrotron| date=18 April 2006| accessdate=27 July 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625091033/http://www.canada.com/saskatoonstarphoenix/news/local/story.html?id=7799751a-5551-44c7-aa98-439657b83dad#| archive-date=25 June 2014| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee was set up in 2006 to [[peer review]] proposals for beamtime, under the chairmanship of Adam Hitchcock of [[McMaster University]].

By the end of 2010 more than 1000 individual researchers had used the facility, and the number of publications had passed 500.&lt;ref name="EllisPiC" /&gt;
From 2009–2012 several key metrics doubled, including the number of users and the number of publications, with more than 190 papers published in 2011. More than 400 proposals were received for beam time in 2012, with approximately a 50% oversubscription rate averaged over the operational beamlines. By 2012 the user community spanned all regions of Canada and around 20 other countries.&lt;ref name="Stride" /&gt; That year a high school group from [[La Loche]] Saskatchewan became the first to use the purpose built educational beamline IDEAS.&lt;ref name="IDEAS" /&gt; Also in 2012 the CLS signed an agreement with the [[Advanced Photon Source]] synchrotron in the USA to allow Canadian researchers access to their facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aps.anl.gov/News/APS_News/Content/APS_NEWS_20120618.php

An international team led by [[University of Calgary]] professor Ken Ng solved the detailed structure of [[RNA polymerase]] using X-ray crystallography at the CLS. This enzyme replicates itself as the [[Norwalk virus]] spreads through the body, and has been linked to other [[supervirus]]es such as [[hepatitis C]], [[West Nile virus]] and the [[common cold]].

This disease can lead to an aggressive form of cancer known as [[esophageal adenocarcinoma]].&lt;ref name="Barrett"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news163563060.html|title=Researchers Shed Light on Esophageal Disease| date= 8 June 2009 | accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from [[Lakehead University]] and the University of Saskatchewan used the CLS to investigate the deaths of [[Royal Navy]] sailors buried in [[Antigua]] in the late 1700s. They used X-ray fluorescence to look for trace elements such as lead and [[strontium]] in bones from a recently [[excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] naval cemetery&lt;ref name="Navy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.innovationanthology.com/news.php?id=782|title=Synchrotron reveals tales told by old bones| date= 30 April 2012 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists from [[Stanford University]] worked with CLS scientists to design a cleaner, faster [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The new battery charges in less than two minutes, thanks to a newly developed [[carbon]] [[nanostructure]]. The team grew [[nanocrystal]]s of iron and nickel on carbon. Traditional batteries lack this structure, mixing iron and nickel with conductors more or less randomly. The result was a strong chemical bond between the materials, which the team identified and studied at the synchrotron.&lt;ref name="Battery"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news/2012-07-cleaner-faster-battery.html|title=A cleaner, faster battery| date= 9 July 2012 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team led by the [[Politecnico di Milano]], including scientists from the [[University of Waterloo]] and the University of British Columbia, found the first experimental evidence that a [[charge density wave]] instability competes with superconductivity in [[high-temperature superconductors]]. They used four synchrotrons including the REIXS beamline at CLS.&lt;ref name="Super"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lightsource.ca/media/media_release_20120712.php|title=Synchrotrons help bring superconductors out of the cold| date= 13 July 2012 | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the X-ray spectromicroscopy beamline, a research team led by scientists from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York, Buffalo]] produced images of [[graphene]] showing how folds and ripples act as [[speed bump]]s for electrons, affecting its [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]]. This has implications for the use of graphene in a variety of future products.&lt;ref name="Graphene"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.labcanada.com/news/canadian-light-source-spots-speed-bumps-in-graphenes-electron-highway/1000541035/|title=Canadian Light Source spots speed bumps in graphene's electron highway| date= 15 August 2011 | accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A collaboration between the [[University of Regina]] and the [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum]] has been investigating [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s at the CLS, including "Scotty," a [[Tyrannosaurus]] found in Saskatchewan in 1991, one of the most complete and largest T-rex skeletons ever found. They looked at the concentration of elements in bones to study the impact of the environment on such animals.&lt;ref name="Barbi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/canada/46870-professor-uses-new-technology-shed-light-dinosaur-bones|title=Professor uses new technology to shed light on dinosaur bones | date= 28 December 2011 | accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industrial Program and Economic Impact==
[[Image:Cellphone X-ray.jpg|thumb|left|110px|Image of a cellphone taken at CLS]]

From inception, the CLS showed a "strong commitment to industrial users and private/public partnerships",{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=166}} with then-director Bancroft reporting "more than 40 letters of support from industry indicating that [the CLS] is important for what they do".{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=167}} This commitment has been criticised, notably by University of Saskatchewan professor Howard Woodhouse, since only two private companies provided capital funding, with the rest coming from public funds,{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=166}} while up to 25% of beamline time at CLS is allocated to commercial use.{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=166}}&lt;ref name="tool" /&gt; The CLS has an industrial group, within the larger experimental facilities division, with industrial liaison scientists who make synchrotron techniques available to a "non-traditional" user base who are not synchrotron experts. By 2007 more than 60 projects had been carried out,&lt;ref name="tool" /&gt; although in a speech in the same year, then-CLS director Bill Thomlinson said that "one of the biggest challenges for the synchrotron...is to get private users through the door", with less than 10% of time actually used by industry.{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=170}} 
 
In 1999 then-Saskatoon mayor Dayday stated that "the CLS will add $122 million to Canada's GDP during construction and $12 million annually after that".{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=163}} An [[economic impact analysis|economic impact study]] of the two [[financial year]]s 2009/10 and 10/11 showed the CLS had added $45 million per year to the Canadian GDP, or about $3 for every $1 of operating funding.&lt;ref name="impact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightsource.ca/media/media_release_20111122.php |title=Canadian Light Source making positive economic, scientific impacts for Canada |date=22 November 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The CLS has been cited as an example of the commercialization of university research endangering "other areas of scholarship and research that is perceived to be of little immediate utility for generating private monetary wealth".{{sfn|Woodhouse|p=8}} The CLS itself has stated that "the primary means of accessing the CLS is through a system of peer review, which ensures that the proposed science is of the highest quality and permits access to the facility to any interested researcher, regardless of regional, national, academic, industrial or governmental affiliation."&lt;ref name="progress" /&gt;

==Official Visitors==
[[Image:Governor General at CLS.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Michaëlle Jean (C) at the Canadian Light Source, with CLS Director Josef Hormes (L) and University of Saskatchewan President [[Peter MacKinnon]] (R)]]

The Queen toured the second floor balcony while the Prince explored the machinery below. The synchrotron was turned off for the visit to reduce the noise level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/royals/royalvisitdiary_050519.html |title=Royal visit diary |date=19 May 2005 |accessdate=15 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601111435/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/royals/royalvisitdiary_050519.html |archivedate=1 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2010 then-[[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] visited the CLS as part of a two-day tour of Saskatchewan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/story/2010/08/24/sk-jean-tour-1008.html|title=Michaëlle Jean wraps up Sask. visit  |date=24 August 2010 |accessdate=15 July 2012|work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2012 the CLS was "visited" remotely by Governor General [[David Johnston]]. He was visiting the [[LNLS]] synchrotron in [[Brazil]], during a live link-up, by video chat and remote control software, between the two facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsaskatoon.com/saskatoon+synchrotron+operated+via+brazil/6442630904/story.html|title=Saskatoon synchrotron operated via Brazil|date=29 April 2012|accessdate=15 July 2012|archivedate=24 January 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124024656/http://www.globalsaskatoon.com/saskatoon+synchrotron+operated+via+brazil/6442630904/story.html|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  January 18, 2017 Canadian Science Minister Kirsty Duncan toured the complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.flickr.com/photos/97079436@N04/sets/72157677855587540/with/32407377005/|title=Minister Duncan Visit |date=18 January 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical Isotope Project==

With the [[National Research Universal reactor|NRU]] reactor at the [[Chalk River Laboratories]] due to close in 2016, there was a need to find alternative sources of the medical isotope [[technetium-99m]], a mainstay of [[nuclear medicine]]. In 2011 the Canadian Light Source received $14 Million in funding to investigate the feasibility of using an electron [[LINAC]] to produce [[molybdenum-99]], the parent isotope of technetium-99.&lt;ref name="CBCisotopes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2011/01/24/sk-synchrotron-isotopes-1101.html |title=Sask. Synchrotron to make medical isotopes |date=24 November 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2012 |work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this project a 35MeV LINAC has been installed in an unused underground experimental hall previously used for [[photodisintegration|photonuclear]] experiments with the SAL LINAC. First [[irradiation]]s are planned for late summer 2012, with the results to be evaluated by the [[Winnipeg]] [[Health Sciences Centre (Winnipeg)|Health Sciences Centre]].&lt;ref name="isotope2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/IPAC2012/papers/thxa01.pdf|title=Producing medical isotopes using X-rays| year=2012 | format=PDF | accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education program==
[[Image:Students on the beamline.jpg|thumb|left|250px|High school students from La Loche at the Canadian Light Source]]
The CLS has an education program – "Students on the Beamlines" – funded by NSERC Promoscience. This outreach program for science allows high school students to fully experience the work of a scientist, in addition to having the chance to use the CLS beamlines.

"The program allows students the development of active research, a very rare phenomena in schools and provides direct access to the use of a particle accelerator, something even rarer!" said teacher Steve Desfosses form College Saint-Bernard, [[Drummondville]], Quebec.&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;[http://www.journalexpress.ca/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9/%C3%89ducation/2012-03-03/article-2914331/Le-synchrotron-de-Saskatoon-mis-a-la-portee-de-jeunes-scientifiques-du-College-SaintBernard/1 "Le synchrotron de Saskatoon mis à la portée de jeunes scientifiques du Collège Saint-Bernard"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130115150408/http://www.journalexpress.ca/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9/%C3%89ducation/2012-03-03/article-2914331/Le-synchrotron-de-Saskatoon-mis-a-la-portee-de-jeunes-scientifiques-du-College-SaintBernard/1# |date=15 January 2013 }},''L'Express'' 3 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Dene]] students from La Loche, Saskatchewan have taken part in this program twice, looking at effects of [[acid rain]].&lt;ref name="Dene"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.lightsource.ca/media/spotlight_northern_exposure.php| title=Northern Exposure: Students from Saskatchewan's North do synchrotron science | date=October 2011| accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student Jontae DesRoches commented "Elders have noticed that the landscape, where trees used to grow, there's none growing anymore. They're pretty concerned because wildlife is disappearing. Like, here there used to be rabbits and now there's none".&lt;ref name="ammsa"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ammsa.com/publications/saskatchewan-sage/experiment-teaches-students-hands-chemistry-curriculum| title=Experiment teaches students hands-on chemistry curriculum | year=2011| accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012 three student groups were at the CLS simultaneously, with the La Loche students as the first to use the IDEAS beamline.&lt;ref name="IDEAS" /&gt;

"The aim for the students," according to CLS education and outreach coordinator Tracy Walker, "is to get an authentic scientific inquiry that's different from the examples in textbooks that have been done thousands of times."&lt;ref name="CFIschool"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.innovation.ca/node/5116 | title=Particle accelerating ... in high school | date=10 March 2010| accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students from six [[Canadian province|provinces]] as well as the [[Northwest Territories]] have been directly involved in experiments, some of which have yielded publishable-quality research.&lt;ref name="Stride" /&gt;

In 2012 the CLS was awarded the [[Canadian Nuclear Society]]'s Education and Communication Award "in recognition of its commitment to community outreach, increasing public awareness of synchrotron science, and developing innovative and outstanding secondary educational programs such as Students on the Beamlines".&lt;ref name="award" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Technical description==

===Accelerators===
[[Image:CLS synchrotron.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The booster and storage rings inside the experimental hall]]
[[Image:Chicaned Undulators.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chicaned undulators inside the storage ring]]

====Injection system====

The injection system consists of a 250 MeV LINAC, a low energy transfer line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high energy transfer line.&lt;ref name="Injection"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/papers/thpkf008.pdf| title=Injection system for the Canadian Light Source | year=2004 | format=PDF | accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LINAC was operated for over 30 years as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Lab&lt;ref name="update 2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/e04/papers/thpkf008.pdf|title=The Canadian Light Source: an update | year=2001 | format=PDF | accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operates at 2856&amp;nbsp;MHz. The 78m low energy transfer line takes the electrons from the below-ground LINAC to the ground level booster in the newer CLS building, via two vertical chicanes. The full energy 2.9 GeV booster, chosen to give high orbit stability in the storage ring, operates at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz, with an RF frequency of 500&amp;nbsp;MHz, unsynchronised with the LINAC. This results in significant beam loss at the extraction energy.&lt;ref name="Injection"/&gt;

====Storage Ring====

The storage ring cell structure has a fairly compact lattice with twelve straight sections available for injection, [[microwave cavity|RF cavities]] and 9 sections available for insertion devices. Each cell has two bending magnets detuned to allow some dispersion in the straights – the so-called double-bend achromat structure – and thus reduce the overall beam size. As well as the two bend magnets each cell has three families of quadrupole magnets and two families of [[sextupole magnet]]s. The ring circumference is 171m, with a straight section length of 5.2m.&lt;ref name="PAC2001"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/proceedings/PAPERS/WPPH093.PDF | title=The Canadian Light Source: an update | year=2001 | format=PDF | accessdate=28 July 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032624/http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/proceedings/PAPERS/WPPH093.PDF# | archive-date=2 May 2014 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CLS is the smallest of the newer synchrotron facilities, which results in a relatively high horizontal [[beam emittance]] of 18.2&amp;nbsp;nm-rad.&lt;ref name="Newest" /&gt;  The CLS was also one of the first facilities to [[chicane]] two [[undulator]]s in one straight section, to maximize the number of insertion device beamlines.&lt;ref name="SRNupdate"/&gt;

All five of the phase I X-ray beamlines use insertion devices. Four use permanent magnet undulators designed and assembled at the CLS, including one in-vacuum undulator and one elliptically polarized undulator (EPU). The HXMA beamline uses a superconducting [[wiggler (synchrotron)|wiggler]] built by the [[Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics]] in [[Novosibirsk]].&lt;ref name="SRNupdate"/&gt; Phase II added two further devices including another Budker superconducting wiggler, for the BMIT beamline.&lt;ref name="ID"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lightsource.ca/operations/insertion_devices.php|title=Insertion devices| accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phase III will add four more devices, filling 8 of the 9 available straight sections. Longer term development includes the replacement of two of the phase I undulators with elliptically polarizing devices.&lt;ref name="IDdev"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accelconf.web.cern.ch/accelconf/IPAC10/papers/wepd005.pdf|title=Insertion Device Development at the Canadian Light Source| year=2010 | format=PDF | accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ring operates at a fill current of 250mA with two injections per day.&lt;ref name="EllisPiC"/&gt; Facility status is shown on a "machine status" [http://mstatus.lightsource.ca/ webpage], and using the [https://twitter.com/clsfc CLSFC] account on Twitter.&lt;ref name="Gems"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialmediatoday.com/dezguy/267745/three-useful-twitter-case-studies |title=Three useful Twitter case studies |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=15 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613182326/http://socialmediatoday.com/dezguy/267745/three-useful-twitter-case-studies |archivedate=13 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Superconducting RF Cavity ====
The CLS was the first light source to use a [[wikipedia:Superconducting radio frequency|superconducting RF (SRF) cavity]] in the storage ring from the beginning of operations.&lt;ref name="SRNupdate" /&gt; The [[niobium]] cavity is based on the 500&amp;nbsp;MHz design used at the [[Cornell Electron Storage Ring]] (CESR) which allows potentially beam-perturbing high order modes to propagate out of the cavity where they can be very effectively damped.&lt;ref name="PAC2001" /&gt;  The superconducting nature of the niobium cavity means only 0.02% of the RF power put into the cavity is wasted in heating the cavity as compared to roughly 40% for normal-conducting (copper) cavities.  However, a large portion of this power saving - about 160&amp;nbsp;kW out of the 250&amp;nbsp;kW saved - is needed to power the cryogenic plant required to supply liquid helium to the cavity.  The SRF cavity at CLS is fed with RF from a 310&amp;nbsp;kW Thales klystron.

Cold hardening is a process in which a plant undergoes physiological changes to avoid, or mitigate [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] injuries caused by sub-zero temperatures.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Non-acclimatized individuals can survive −5&amp;nbsp;°C, while an acclimatized individual in the same species can survive −30°. Plants that originated in the tropics, like [[tomato]] or [[maize]], don't go through cold hardening and are unable to survive freezing temperatures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKhann|first=Heather I.|last2=Gery|first2=Carine|last3=Bérard|first3=Aurélie|last4=Lévêque|first4=Sylvie|last5=Zuther|first5=Ellen|last6=Hincha|first6=Dirk K.|last7=De Mita|first7=S.|last8=Brunel|first8=Dominique|last9=Téoulé|first9=Evelyne|date=2008-01-01|title=Natural variation in CBF gene sequence, gene expression and freezing tolerance in the Versailles core collection of Arabidopsis thaliana|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-8-105|journal=BMC Plant Biology|volume=8|pages=105|doi=10.1186/1471-2229-8-105|issn=1471-2229|pmc=2579297|pmid=18922165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plant starts the [[Adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] by exposure to cold yet still not freezing temperatures. The process can be divided into three steps. First the plant perceives low temperature, then converts the [[Signal (biology)|signal]] to activate or repress [[Gene expression|expression]] of appropriate [[gene]]s. Finally, it uses these genes to combat the [[Stress (biology)|stress]], caused by sub-zero temperatures, affecting its living [[Cell (biology)|cells]]. Many of the genes and responses to low temperature [[Stress (biology)|stress]] are shared with other [[abiotic stress]]es, like drought or salinity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[Image:Plant cell structure-en.svg|thumb|200px|Schematic of typical plant cell]]When temperature drops, the [[Cell membrane|membrane]] fluidity, [[RNA]] and [[DNA]] stability, and [[enzyme]] activity change. These, in turn, affect [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], [[Translation (biology)|translation]], [[Metabolism|intermediate metabolism]], and [[photosynthesis]], leading to an energy imbalance. This energy imbalance is thought to be one of the ways the plant detects low temperature. Experiments on ''[[arabidopsis]]'' show that the plant detects the change in temperature, rather than the [[Thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The rate of temperature drop is directly connected to the magnitude of [[calcium]] influx, from the space between cells, into the cell. [[Calcium channel]]s in the [[cell membrane]] detect the temperature drop, and promotes expression of low temperature responsible genes in ''[[alfalfa]]'' and ''[[arabidopsis]]''. The response to the change in [[calcium]] elevation depends on the cell type and [[Stress (biology)|stress]] history. [[Shoot]] tissue will respond more than a [[root]] cells, and a cell that already is [[Adaptation|adapted]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;to [[Hypothermia|cold stress]] will respond more than one that has not been through cold hardening before. Light doesn't control the onset of cold hardening directly, but shortening of daylight is associated with fall, and starts production of [[reactive oxygen species]] and excitation of [[Photosystem II|photosystem 2]], which influences low-temp [[signal transduction]] mechanisms. Plants with compromised perception of day length have compromised cold acclimation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Cold increases [[Cell permeability|cell membrane permeability]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=itB5yKv7-rIC|title=Plants in Agriculture|last=Forbes|first=James C.|last2=Watson|first2=Drennan|date=1992-08-20|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521427913|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes the cell shrink, as water is drawn out when ice is formed in the [[extracellular matrix]] between cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; To retain the [[surface area]] of the [[cell membrane]] so it will be able to regain its former [[volume]] when temperature rises again, the plant forms more and stronger [[Hechtian strand]]s. These are tubelike structures that connect the [[protoplast]] with the cell wall. When the [[intracellular]] water freezes, the cell will expand, and without cold hardening the cell would rupture. To protect the cell membrane from expansion induced damage, the plant cell changes the proportions of almost all [[lipid]]s in the cell membrane, and increases the amount of total soluble [[protein]] and other cryoprotecting molecules, like sugar and [[proline]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Chilling injury occurs at 0–10 degrees Celsius, as a result of membrane damage, metabolic changes, and toxic buildup. Symptoms include wilting, water soaking, [[necrosis]], [[chlorosis]], ion leakage, and decreased growth. Freezing injury may occur at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius. Symptoms of extracellular freezing include structural damage, dehydration, and necrosis. If intracellular freezing occurs, it will lead to death. Freezing injury is a result of lost permeability, plasmolysis, and post-thaw cell bursting.

When spring comes, or during a mild spell in winter, plants de-harden, and if the temperature is warm for long enough – their growth resumes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Insects==
Cold hardening has also been observed in [[insect]]s such as the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] and [[diamondback moth]]. The insects use rapid cold hardening to protect against [[cold shock]] during overwintering periods.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A rapid cold-hardening process in insects|last=Chen|first=CP|last2=Denlinger|first2=DL|journal=Science|last3=Lee|first3=RE|pmid=17800568|doi=10.1126/science.238.4832.1415|volume=238|issue=4832|pages=1415–7|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A rapid cold-hardening response protecting against cold shock injury in Drosophila melanogaster|last=Lee|first=RE|last2=Czajka|first2=MC|publisher=Science|pmid=2106564|volume=148|journal=J Exp Biol|pages=245–54|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Overwintering]] insects stay awake and active through the winter while non-overwintering insects [[Insect migration|migrate]] or die. Rapid cold hardening can be experienced during short periods of undesirable temperatures, such as [[Cold shock response|cold shock]] in environment temperature, as well as the common cold months. The buildup of [[Cryoprotectant|cryoprotective]] compounds is the reason that insects can experience cold hardening.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Glycerol]] is a cryoprotective substance found within these insects capable of overwintering. Through testing, glycerol requires interactions with other [[cell components]] within the insect in order to decrease the body's permeability to the cold.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When an insect is exposed to these cold temperatures, glycerol rapidly accumulates. Glycerol is known as a [[non-ionic]] [[Kosmotropic|kosmotrope]] forming powerful [[hydrogen bond]]s with [[water molecule]]s. The hydrogen bonds in the glycerol compound compete with the weaker bonds between the water molecules causing an interruption in the makeup of ice formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duman | first1 = J | year = 2002 | title = The inhibition of ice nucleators by insect antifreeze proteins is enhanced by glycerol and citrate | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00360-001-0239-7 | journal = Journal of Comparative Physiology B | volume = 172 | issue = 2| pages = 163–168 | doi = 10.1007/s00360-001-0239-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This chemistry found within the glycerol compound and reaction between water has been used as an [[antifreeze]] in the past, and can be seen here when concerning cold hardening. Proteins also play a large role in the cryoprotective compounds that increase ability to survive the cold hardening process and environmental change. [[Glycogen phosphorylase]] (GlyP) has been a key protein found during testing to increase in comparison to a controlled group not experiencing the cold hardening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Overgaard | first1 = J. | last2 = Sørensen | first2 = J. G. | last3 = Com | first3 = E. | last4 = Colinet | first4 = H. | year = 2013 | title = The rapid cold hardening response of Drosophila melanogaster: Complex regulation across different levels of biological organization | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022191014000109 | journal = Journal of Insect Physiology | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 46–53 | doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.01.009| pmid = 24508557 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once warmer temperatures are observed the process of [[acclimation]] begins, and the increased glycerol along with other cryoprotective compounds and proteins are also reversed. There is a rapid cold hardening capacity found within certain insects that suggests not all insects can survive a long period of overwintering. Non-[[Diapause|diapausing]] insects can sustain brief temperature shocks but often have a limit to which they can handle before the body can no longer produce enough cryoprotective components.
&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[File:Saving the planet one fruit fly at a time - part 1 (7353498896).jpg|thumb|The common fruit fly]]
Inclusive to the cold hardening process being beneficial for insects survival during cold temperatures, it also helps improve the [[organism]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s performance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = R. E. | last2 = Damodaran | first2 = K. | last3 = Yi | first3 = S. X. | last4 = Lorigan | first4 = G.

The ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (common fruit fly) is a frequently experimented insect involving cold hardening. A proven example of RCH enhancing organisms performance comes from courting and mating within the fruit fly. It has been tested that the fruit fly mated more frequently once RCH has commenced in relation to a controlled insect group not experiencing RCH.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most insects experiencing extended cold periods are observed to modify the [[membrane lipids]] within the body. Desaturation of [[fatty acid]]s are the most commonly seen modification to the [[membrane]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; When the fruit fly was observed under the stressful climate the survival rate increased in comparison to the fly prior to cold hardening.
[[File:Plutella.xylostella.7383.jpg|thumb|The diamondback moth]]
In addition to testing on the common fruit fly, ''[[Diamondback moth|Plutella xylostella]]'' (diamondback moth) also has been widely studied for its significance in cold hardening. While this insect also shows an increase in glycerol and similar cryoprotective compounds, it also shows an increase in [[polyol]]s. These compounds are specifically linked to cryoprotective compounds designed to withstand cold hardening. The polyol compound is freeze-susceptible and [[Freeze tolerance|freeze tolerant]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = Y. | last2 = Kim | first2 = Y. | year = 2014 | title = A specific glycerol kinase induces rapid cold hardening of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022191014001255 | journal = Journal of Insect Physiology | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 56–63 | doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2014.06.010| pmid = 24973793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyols simply act as a barrier within the insect body by preventing [[intracellular]] freezing by restricting the [[extracellular]] freezing likely to happen in overwintering periods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; During the larvae stage of the diamondback moth, the significance of glycerol was tested again for validity. The lab injected the larvae with added glycerol and in turn proved that glycerol is a major factor in survival rate when cold hardening. The cold tolerance is directly proportional to the buildup of glycerol during cold hardening.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Cold hardening of insects improves the survival rate of the species and improves function. Once environmental temperature begins to warm up above freezing, the cold hardening process is reversed and the glycerol and cryprotective compounds decrease within the body. This also reverts the function of the insect to pre-cold hardening activity.

'''Comparative politics''' is a field in [[political science]], characterized by an [[empiricism|empirical]] approach based on the ''[[comparative method]]''. In other words, comparative politics is the study of the domestic politics, political institutions, and conflicts of countries. It often involves comparisons among countries and through time within single countries, emphasizing key patterns of similarity and difference. [[Arend Lijphart]] argues that comparative politics does not have a ''substantive'' focus in itself, but rather a ''methodological'' one: it focuses on "the ''how'' but does not specify the ''what'' of the analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lijphart|first=Arend|year=1971|title=Comparative politics and the comparative method|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=65|issue=3|pages=682–693|jstor=1955513|doi=10.2307/1955513}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, comparative politics is not defined by the object of its study, but rather by the method it applies to study political phenomena. [[Peter Mair]] and [[Richard Rose (political scientist)|Richard Rose]] advance a slightly different definition, arguing that comparative politics is defined by a combination of a ''substantive'' focus on the study of countries' political systems and a ''method'' of identifying and explaining similarities and differences between these countries using common concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mair|first=Peter|title=A New Handbook of Political Science|editor=Goodin, Robert E.|editor2=Klingemann, Hans-Dieter|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1996|pages=309–335|chapter=Comparative politics: An introduction to comparative.overview|isbn=0-19-829471-9|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oso/414665/1998/00000001/00000001/art00016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606215002/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/oso/414665/1998/00000001/00000001/art00016|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=|access-date=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Richard|year=1991|title=Comparing forms of comparative analysis|journal=Political Studies|volume=39|issue=3|pages=446–462|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119347508/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9248.1991.tb01622.x|last2=MacKenzie|first2=W. J. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose states that, on his definition: "The focus is explicitly or implicitly upon more than one country, thus following familiar political science usage in excluding within-nation comparison. Methodologically, comparison is distinguished by its use of concepts that are applicable in more than one country."&lt;ref name="Rose"/&gt;

When applied to specific fields of study, comparative politics may be referred to by other names, such as for example '''comparative government''' (the comparative study of forms of [[government]]) or '''comparative foreign policy''' (comparing the [[foreign policy|foreign policies]] of different States in order to establish general empirical connections between the characteristics of the State and the characteristics of its foreign policy).

Sometimes, especially in the United States, the term "comparative politics" is used to refer to "the politics of foreign countries." This usage of the term, however, is often considered incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkin, J. [2002 (1995)] "Comparative Methods", in Marsh, D. and G. Stoker (ed.) ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'', Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 249–250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vanBiezen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Biezen|first=Ingrid|authorlink=Ingrid van Biezen|author2=Caramani, Daniele|year=2006|title=(Non)comparative politics in Britain|journal=Politics|volume=26|issue=1|pages=29–37|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118602277/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9256.2006.00248.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Comparative political science" as a general term for an area of study, as opposed to a methodology of study, can be seen as redundant. The political only shows as political when either an overt or tacit comparison is being made.  A study of a single political entity, whether a society, subculture or period, would show the political as simple brute reality without comparison with another society, subculture, or period.

The highest award in the discipline of Comparative Politics is the [[Karl Deutsch]] award, awarded by the [[International Political Science Association]]. So far, it has been given to [[Juan Linz]] (2003), [[Charles Tilly]] (2006), [[Giovanni Sartori]] (2009), and [[Alfred Stepan]] (2012).

==Methodology==
The comparative method is – together with the [[experiment|experimental method]], the [[statistics|statistical method]] and the [[case study]] approach – one of the four fundamental [[scientific method]]s which can be used to test the validity of theoretical propositions, often with the use of empirical data i.e. to establish relationships among two or more empirical variables or concepts while all other variables are held constant.&lt;ref&gt;Lijphart, A. (1971), cit., p. 683&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the comparative method is generally used when neither the experimental nor the statistical method can be employed: on the one hand, experiments can only rarely be conducted in political science;&lt;ref&gt;Hopkin, J. [2002 (1995)], cit., p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand the statistical method implies the mathematical manipulation of quantitative data about a large number of cases, while sometimes political research must be conducted by analyzing the behavior of qualitative variables in a small number of cases.&lt;ref&gt;As Lijphart points out in the article cited above, the experimental and statistical methods share the same logic as the comparative method: they all imply a comparison between cases which differ on the variable which is being studied, while remaining identical on all the other possible variables.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Comparative strategies===
Two major strategies are used in comparative research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://poli.haifa.ac.il/~levi/mlogic.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822123557/http://poli.haifa.ac.il/~levi/mlogic.html |archivedate=2007-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Most Similar Systems Design]]/[[Mill's Method of Difference]]: it consists in comparing very similar cases which only differ in the ''dependent variable'', on the assumption that this would make it easier to find those ''independent variables'' which explain the presence/absence of the dependent variable. Most Similar Systems Design, or MSSD, is very helpful since it compares similar objects, it keeps many otherwise confusing and irrelevant variables in the research constant. In a basic sense, MSSD starts out with similar variables between subjects and tries to figure out why the outcome is different between the subjects.  The main shortcoming that is said about this method is that when comparing countries, since there are such a limited number of them, all potential factors of explanation can never be kept altogether constant.  As such, despite many possibilities of variables, there are only a limited number of cases to apply them to.  There are two methods of applying MSSD, the first being a stricter application and the second being a more loose application. The stricter application implies that a researcher would choose various countries that have a number of similar variables, also called control variables, and would only differ from each other by one single independent variable.  The looser application uses the same general concept, but the researcher chooses countries that have similar characteristics but those characteristics are not strictly matched to a set of control variables.  Because of the complications of so many variables but not enough cases, a second method was devolved to be used in conjunction with MSSD.&lt;ref name="Anckar, Carsten 2008"&gt;Anckar, Carsten. "On the Applicability of the Most Similar Systems Design and the Most Different Systems Design in Comparative Research." International Journal of Social Research Methodology 11.5 (2008): 389–401. Informaworld. Web. 20 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Most Different Systems Design]]/[[Mill's Method of Similarity]]: it consists in comparing very different cases, all of which however have in common the same ''dependent variable'', so that any other circumstance which is present in all the cases can be regarded as the ''independent variable''.  Most Different Systems Design, or MDSD,  differs from MSSD with focus and the fact that it does not take a strict variable application.  MDSD uses differences between countries instead of similarities between countries as variables because social scientists have found that differences between countries do not explain their possible similarities if they have any.  A more basic idea of MDSD is it takes subjects with different variables within them and tries to figure out why the outcomes between them are similar in the end.  When using MDSD as a comparative research method, scientists look at changing interactions between systems in countries and then after all data is collected, the results are compared between the different systems. If the results obtained from this research differ between each other, the researcher must move up to the system level and switch to the MSSD method.  When using MSSD as a comparative research approach, there is the independent and depend variable that get introduced, specifically the dependent variable being something that is common in all the research subjects and the independent variable which would be the differing characteristic between the research subjects.  MSSD is more precise and strict at finding the differing point along with similarities, but MDSD does not have so many variables and only focuses on finding one similarity or difference between a wide selection of systems.&lt;ref name="Anckar, Carsten 2008"/&gt;

==Some major works in comparative politics==
*[[Aristotle]]
: In his work ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|The Politics]]'', Aristotle compares different "constitutions", by introducing a famous typology based on two criteria: the number of rulers (one, few, many) and the nature of the political regime (good or corrupt). Thus he distinguishes six different kinds of "constitutions": monarchy, aristocracy, and polity (good types), versus tyranny, oligarchy and democracy (corrupt types).
*[[Gabriel Almond]] and [[Sidney Verba]]
: In their work, ''The Civic Culture'', Almond and Verba embark on the first major cross-national survey of attitudes to determine the role of political culture in maintaining the stability of democratic regimes.
*[[Robert A. Dahl]]
: ''Polyarchy''
*[[Montesquieu]]
: ''The Spirit of the Laws''
*[[Barrington Moore]]
: In ''Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy: Lord and Peasant in the Making of the Modern World'' (1966) Moore compares revolutions in countries like England, Russia and Japan (among others).  His thesis is that mass-led revolutions dispossess the landed elite and result in Communism, and that revolutions by the elite result in Fascism.  It is thus only revolutions by the bourgeoisie that result in democratic governance.  For the outlier case of India, practices of the Mogul Empire, British Imperial rule and the Caste System are cited.
*[[James C. Scott]]
: ''The Art of Not Being Governed''
*[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]
: ''Democracy in America'' and ''The Old Regime and the French Revolution''
*[[Samuel P. Huntington]]
: ''The Third Wave'' and ''Political Order in Changing Societies''
*[[Arend Lijphart]]
: ''Patterns of Democracy'' (1999), a comprehensive study of democracies around the world.
*[[Juan Linz]] &amp; [[Alfred Stepan]]
: ''Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation: Southern Europe, South America, and Post Communist Europe''
*[[Seymour Martin Lipset]]
: ''Political Man: The Social Basis of Politics'' (1960)
*[[Pippa Norris]]
: ''Critical citizens'' (1999)
*[[Robert D. Putnam]]
: ''Making Democracy Work'' (1993), a major work assessing why some democratic governments work and other fail, based on the study of the Italian regional governments.
*[[Theda Skocpol]]
: In ''States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia, and China'' Theda Skocpol compares the major revolutions of France, Russia and China: three basically similar events which took place in three very different contexts. Skopcol's purpose is to find possible similarities which might help explain the phenomenon of political revolution. From this point of view, this work represents a good example of a research conducted according to the Most Different Systems Design.

'''Cosmogenic nuclides''' (or '''cosmogenic isotopes''') are rare [[nuclide]]s ([[isotope]]s) created when a high-energy [[cosmic ray]] interacts with the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an ''[[in situ]]'' Solar System [[atom]], causing nucleons (protons and neutrons) to be expelled from the atom (see [[cosmic ray spallation]]). These isotopes are produced within Earth materials such as [[rock (geology)|rock]]s or [[soil]], in [[Earth|Earth's]] [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], and in extraterrestrial items such as [[meteorite]]s.  By measuring cosmogenic isotopes, [[scientist]]s are able to gain insight into a range of [[geology|geological]] and [[astronomy|astronomical]] processes.  There are both [[radioactive isotope|radioactive]] and [[stable isotope|stable]] cosmogenic isotopes.  Some of these radioisotopes are [[tritium]], [[carbon-14]] and [[phosphorus-32]].

Certain light (low atomic number) [[primordial nuclides]] (some isotopes of [[lithium]], [[beryllium]] and [[boron]]) are thought to have arisen not only during the [[Big Bang]], and also (and perhaps primarily) to have been made after the Big Bang, but before the condensation of the Solar System, by the process of [[cosmic ray spallation]] on interstellar gas and dust. This explains their higher abundance in cosmic rays as compared with their ratios and abundances of certain other nuclides on Earth. This also explains the overabundance of the early [[transition metal]]s just before [[iron]] in the periodic table; the cosmic-ray spallation of iron thus produces [[scandium]] through [[chromium]] on one hand and [[helium]] through boron on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the arbitrary defining qualification for cosmogenic nuclides of being formed "in situ in the Solar System" (meaning inside an already-aggregated piece of the Solar System) prevents primordial nuclides formed by cosmic ray spallation ''before'' the formation of the Solar System, from being termed "cosmogenic nuclides"— even though the mechanism for their formation is exactly the same. These same nuclides still arrive on Earth in small amounts in cosmic rays, and are formed in meteoroids, in the atmosphere, on Earth, "cosmogenically." However, beryllium (all of it stable beryllium-9) is present{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} primordially in the Solar System in much larger amounts, having existed prior to the condensation of the Solar System, and thus present in the materials from which the Solar System formed.

To make the distinction in another fashion, the ''timing'' of their formation determines which subset of cosmic ray spallation-produced nuclides are termed '''primordial''' or '''cosmogenic''' (a nuclide cannot belong to both classes). By convention, certain stable nuclides of [[lithium]], [[beryllium]], and [[boron]] are thought{{according to whom|date=February 2014}} to have been produced by cosmic ray spallation in the period of time ''between'' the [[Big Bang]] and the Solar System's formation (thus making these [[primordial nuclide]]s, by definition) are not termed "cosmogenic," even though they were{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} formed by the same process as the cosmogenic nuclides (although at an earlier time). The primordial nuclide beryllium-9, the only stable beryllium isotope, is an example of this type of nuclide.

In contrast, even though the radioactive isotopes [[beryllium-7]] and [[beryllium-10]] fall into this series of three light elements (lithium, beryllium, boron) formed mostly{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} by cosmic ray spallation [[nucleosynthesis]], both of these nuclides have half lives too short for them to have been formed before the formation of the Solar System, and thus they cannot be primordial nuclides. Since the cosmic ray spallation route is the only possible source{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} of beryllium-7 and beryllium-10 occurrence naturally in the environment, they are therefore cosmogenic.

A '''courtesan''' was originally a [[courtier]], which means a person who attends the [[noble court|court]] of a [[Monarchy|monarch]] or other powerful person.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"&gt;[http://www.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary], v. courtesan, -zan, 1, Obs., "One attached to the court of a prince"; courtesan, -zan, 2, "A court-mistress", Etymon "a. F. ''courtisane'', ad. It. ''cortigiana'', in Florio ''cortegiana'' "a curtezane, a strumpet", orig. ''woman attached to the court'', fem. of ''cortigiano''. In quotation 1565 directly from Italian"&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[feudalism|feudal society]], the court was the centre of [[government]] as well as the residence of the monarch, and social and political life were often completely mixed together. Prior to the Renaissance, courtesans served to convey information to visiting dignitaries, when servants could not be trusted. In [[Renaissance|Renaissance Europe]], courtiers played an extremely important role in upper-class society. As it was customary during this time for royal couples to lead separate lives—commonly marrying simply to preserve bloodlines and to secure political alliances—men and women would often seek gratification and companionship from people living at court. In fact, the verb 'to court' originally meant "to be or reside at court", and later came to mean "to behave as a courtier" and then '[[courtship]]', or "to pay amorous attention to somebody".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com ''Oxford English Dictionary''], v. court, verb&lt;/ref&gt; The most intimate companion of a ruler was called the ”[[favourite]]”.

In [[Renaissance]] usage, the Italian word ''cortigiana'', feminine of ''cortigiano'' ("courtier") came to refer to a person who attends the court, and then to a well-educated and independent woman, eventually a trained artist or artisan of dance and singing, especially one associated with wealthy, powerful, or upper-class society who was given luxuries and status in exchange for entertainment and companionship.&lt;ref&gt;In Italy, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] in his ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' uses the masculine form ''cortigiano'' ("courtier") but for the feminine form ''cortigiana'' ("courtesan") uses the term ''donna di palazzo'' (literally "palace lady")&lt;/ref&gt; The word was [[loanword|borrowed]] by English from Italian through the French form ''courtisane'' during the 16th century, especially associated to the meaning of ''donna di palazzo''.&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"/&gt;

A male figure comparable to the courtesan was the Italian ''[[cicisbeo]]'', the French ''[[chevalier (disambiguation)|chevalier]] servant'', the Spanish ''[[cortejo]]'' or ''estrecho''. It actually seems that the figure of the ''chevalier servant'' (French, literally "serving cavalier", lady's escort) of a married lady was quite common in Europe up to the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/110.2/patriarca.html Silvana Patriarca, "Indolence and Regeneration: Tropes and Tensions of Risorgimento Patriotism", The American Historical Review, 110(2), 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810094203/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/110.2/patriarca.html |date=2006-08-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The courtesans of East Asia, particularly those of the [[Japanese empire]], held a different social role than that of their European counterparts. Examples of Japanese courtesans included the [[oiran]] class, who were more focused on the aspect of entertainment in comparison with European courtesans.&lt;ref name="Geisha Dolls"&gt;[http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/jshoaf/Jdolls/oiran.htm "Geisha Dolls"]. University of Florida. 2012-04-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term ''courtesan'' has become a [[euphemism]] to designate a comforter, [[call girl|escort]], [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]] or a [[prostitute]], especially one of dignified etiquette who attracts wealthy, powerful, or influential clients.{{why|date=November 2015}}

There were two types of courtesan.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In one category was a type of courtesan known (in Italy) as the ''cortigiana onesta'', or the honest courtesan, who was cast as an intellectual. In the other was the ''cortigiana di lume'', a lower class of courtesan. Although the latter was still considered better than an average courtesan{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, the former was the sort most often romanticized and treated more-or-less equal to women of the nobility. It is with this type of courtesan that the art of "courtisanerie" is best associated.

The ''cortigiane oneste'' were usually well-educated and worldly (sometimes even more so than the average upper-class woman), and often held simultaneous careers as performers or artists. They were typically chosen on the basis of their "breeding"—social and conversational skills, intelligence, common-sense, and companionship—as well as their physical attributes. It was usually their wit and personality that set them apart from regular women.  Sex constituted only a facet of the courtesan's array of services. For example, they were well-dressed and ready to engage and participate in a variety of topics ranging from art to music to politics.

In some cases, courtesans were from well-to-do backgrounds, and were even married—but to husbands lower on the social ladder than their clients. In these cases, their relationships with those of high social status had the potential to improve their spouses' status—and so, more often than not, the husband was aware of his wife's profession and dealings.&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt;

==Differences in status==

===As primary employment===
Courtesans from non-wealthy backgrounds provided charming companionship for extended periods, no matter what their own feelings or commitments might have been at the time, and sometimes had to be prepared to do so on short notice. They were also subject to lower social status, and often religious disapproval, because of the immoral aspects of their profession and their reliance upon courtisanerie as a primary source of income. In cases like this, a courtesan was solely dependent on her benefactor or benefactors financially, making her vulnerable; [[Cora Pearl]] is a good example.
[[File:Lancelot Volders - Ladies with their servants.jpg|thumb|280px|''Courtesans with their servants'' by [[Lancelot Volders]]]]
Often, courtesans serving in this capacity began their career as a prostitute, although many came to the "profession" by other means. It was not uncommon for a courtesan to enter into an arranged long-term liaison by contract with a wealthy benefactor. These contracts were written up by and witnessed by lawyers, and were binding. Most included some provision for the financial welfare of the courtesan beyond the end of the relationship in the form of an annuity. Many such women became so powerful socially and financially that they could be particular about the men they associated with; in other words they chose their paramour as would any other mistress, not the other way around. Wealthy benefactors would go to great lengths to court a courtesan as a prize, the ultimate goal being a long-term contract as a mistress. 

Occasionally courtesans were passed from one benefactor to another, thereby resulting in them being viewed in society circles as lower than both their benefactor and those of wealth and power with whom they would socialize. Often, in instances of this sort, if the courtesan had satisfactorily served a benefactor, that benefactor would, when ending the affair, pass them on to another benefactor of wealth as a favor to the courtesan, or set them up in an arranged marriage to a semi-wealthy benefactor. In the event that the courtesan had angered or dissatisfied a benefactor, they would often find themselves cast out of wealthy circles, returning more often than not to street [[prostitution]].

===For social or political benefits===
Those from wealthy backgrounds, either by birth or marriage, and who were acting as courtesans only for the social or political advancement of themselves and/or their spouses were generally treated as equals. They were more respected by their extramarital companions, both placing one another's family obligations ahead of the relationship and planning their own liaisons or social engagements around the lovers' marital obligations.

Affairs of this sort would often be short-lived, ending when either the courtesan or the courtesan's spouse received the status or political position desired, or when the benefactor chose the company of another courtesan, and compensated the former companion financially. In instances like this, it was often viewed simply as a business agreement by both parties involved. The benefactor was aware of the political or social favors expected by the courtesan, the courtesan was aware of the price expected from them for those favors being carried out, and the two met one another's demands, an example being [[Madame de Pompadour]].{{Doubtful|date=December 2016}}

This was generally a safe affair, as both the benefactor's spouse and the courtesan's spouse usually were fully aware of the arrangement, and the courtesan was not solely dependent on the benefactor. It, rather, was simply an affair of benefits gained for both those involved. Publicly and socially, affairs of this sort were common during the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, as well as the early 20th century, and were generally accepted in wealthy circles.&lt;ref name="Court"&gt;[http://icqurimage.com/Magazine/courtesan.html "A brief history of the Courtesan"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319091907/http://icqurimage.com/Magazine/courtesan.html |date=2006-03-19 }}(from icqurimage.com, 2005) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Intrigues==
Very often, courtesans would betray one another in acts of political intrigue in attempts to climb into higher positions of power within royal courts. There are many cases throughout history where one courtesan would attempt (sometimes successfully) to supplant the mistress to a king or emperor. This was typically preceded by her discrediting the ruler's companion, often by divulging secrets that could lead to her rival being cast aside and replaced by her. However, this was a delicate process, and if a courtesan of "lower status" attempted to replace a courtesan who wielded a substantial amount of power within the court, it would often result in the lower courtesan being exiled from the royal court, or married off to a lesser noble in an arranged marriage, or even murdered. There are also many examples of courtesans who took advantage of their involvement with powerful individuals.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

==Career length==
In later centuries, from the mid-18th century on, courtesans would often find themselves cast aside by their benefactors, but the days of public execution or imprisonment based on their [[promiscuity|promiscuous]] lifestyle were over. There are many examples of courtesans who, by remaining discreet and respectful to their benefactors, were able to extend their careers into or past middle age and retire financially secure; [[Catherine Walters]] is a good example. By the late 19th century, and for a brief period in the early 20th century, courtesans had reached a level of social acceptance in many circles and settings, often even to the extent of becoming a friend and confidant to the wife of their benefactor.&lt;ref name="Court"/&gt;

More often than not, a woman serving as a courtesan would last in that field only as long as she could prove herself useful to her companion, or companions. This, of course, excludes those who served as courtesans but who were already married into high society. When referring to those who made their service as a courtesan as their main source of income, success was based solely on financial management and longevity. Many climbed through the ranks of royalty, serving as mistress to lesser nobles first, eventually reaching the role of mistress to a king or prince. Others were able to obtain such a high position early on, but few lasted long, and after serving a prince or king there was nowhere to go but down.

[[Pietro Aretino]], an [[Italian Renaissance]] writer, wrote a series of dialogues (''Capricciosi ragionamenti'') in which a mother teaches her daughter what options are available to women and how to be an effective courtesan. The [[France|French]] novelist [[Balzac]] wrote about a courtesan in his ''[[Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes]]'' (1838–47). [[Emile Zola]] likewise wrote a novel, ''[[Nana (book)|Nana]]'' (1880), about a courtesan in nineteenth-century [[France]].

In addition to the list above, the term "courtesan" has often been used in a political context in an attempt to damage the reputation of a powerful woman, or disparage her importance. Because of this, there is still much historical debate over whether certain women in history can be referred to as courtesans. For example, the title was applied to the Byzantine empress [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], who had started life as an erotic actress but later became the wife of the Emperor [[Justinian]] and, after her death, an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[saint]]. The term has also been applied to influential women including [[Anne Boleyn]], Umrao Jaan (Amiran) from the novel &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Umrao Jann Ada]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; : She was kidnapped and sold into a Tawaif Kotha. [[Madaline Bishop]], [[Diane de Poitiers]], [[Mathilde Kschessinska]], [[Pamela Harriman]], [[Eva Perón]] and [[Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel]]. The attempt to define such women as courtesans is often intended to draw attention to certain perceived qualities, ambitions or conduct which are held to be courtesan-like.

'''Design–build''' (or '''design/build''', and abbreviated '''D–B''' or '''D/B''' accordingly) is a [[Project delivery method|project delivery system]] used in the construction industry. It is a method to deliver a project in which the design and construction services are contracted by a single entity known as the '''design–builder''' or '''design–build contractor'''. It can be subdivided into '''architect-led design–build''' ('''ALDB''', sometimes known as '''designer-led design–build''') and '''contractor-led design–build'''.

In contrast to "[[design–bid–build]]" (or "design–tender"), design–build relies on a single point of responsibility contract and is used to minimize risks for the project owner and to reduce the delivery schedule by overlapping the design phase and construction phase of a project. "DB with its single point responsibility carries the clearest contractual remedies for the clients because the DB contractor will be responsible for all of the work on the project, regardless of the nature of the fault".&lt;ref&gt;“Construction Contracts: Law and management” by John Murdoch and Will Hughes, published in 2007 by “Taylor &amp; Francis E-library”, fourth edition, United Kingdom {{ISBN|0-203-96574-4}} simultaneously published in USA {{ISBN|978-0-415-39368-3}} and Canada {{ISBN|978-0-415-39369-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional approach for construction projects consists of the appointment of a designer on one side, and the appointment of a contractor on the other side. The design–build procurement route changes the traditional sequence of work. It answers the client's wishes for a single point of responsibility in an attempt to reduce risks and overall costs. It is now commonly used in many countries and forms of contracts are widely available.

Design–build is sometimes compared to the "master builder" approach, one of the oldest forms of construction procedure. Comparing design–build to the traditional method of procurement, the authors of ''Design-build Contracting Handbook'' noted that: “from a historical perspective the so-called traditional approach is actually a very recent concept, only being in use approximately 150 years. In contrast, the design–build concept—also known as the "master builder" concept—has been reported as being in use for over four millennia."&lt;ref&gt;"Design-Build Contracting Handbook", by Robert Frank Cushman &amp; Michael C. Loulakis, published in 2001 by Aspen Law &amp; Business, USA {{ISBN|0-7355-2182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) takes the position that design–build can be led by a contractor, a designer, a developer or a joint venture, as long as a design–build entity holds a single contract for both design and construction, some architects have suggested that [[architect-led design–build]] is a specific approach to design–build. 

Design-build plays important role in [[pedagogy]], both at universities and in independently organised events such as [[Rural Studio]] or [[ArchiCamp]].

==Design–build contractor==
The "design–builder" is often a [[general contractor]], but in many cases a project is led by a design professional ([[architect]], [[engineer]], [[architectural technologist]] or other professional designers). Some design–build firms employ professionals from both the design and construction sector. Where the design–builder is a general contractor, the [[designers]] are typically retained directly by the contractor. [[Partnership]] or a joint venture between a design firm and a construction firm may be created on a long term basis or for one project only.

Until 1979, the AIA [[American Institute of Architects]]' code of ethics and professional conduct prohibited their members from providing construction services. However today many architects in the United States and elsewhere aspire to provide integrated design and construction services, and one approach towards this goal is design–build. The AIA has acknowledged that design–build is becoming one of the main approaches to construction. In 2003, the AIA endorsed "''The architect's guide to design–build services''",&lt;ref&gt;"The architect's guide to design–build services" By G. William Quatman &amp; Ranjit Dhar, published in 2003 by John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., USA {{ISBN|0-471-21842-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written to help their members acting as design–build contractors. This publication gives guidance through the different phases of the process: design services, contracts, management, insurances, and finances.

==Contractor-led design–build projects: the architect's role==
On contractor-led design–build projects, management is structured so that the owner works directly with a contractor who, in turn, coordinates subcontractors. Architects contribute to contractor-led design–build projects in one of several ways, with varying degrees of responsibility (where "A/E" in each diagram represents the architect/engineer):

[[File:CLDB 3models.jpg|thumb|500px|center|alt=Three models of contractor-led design–build | Three models of contractor-led design–build]]

#Architect as employee of contractor: The architect works for the contractor as an in-house employee. The architect still bears professional risk and is likely to have less control than in other contractor-led design–build approaches.
#Architect as a subcontractor: Here, the architect is one of the many subcontractors on the team led by the contractor. The architect bears similar professional risk but still with little control.
#Architect as second party in contractor-led integrated project delivery (IPD): The architect and contractor work together in a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. The building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. The contractor leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the architect might defer to the contractor. The architect bears the same risk as they do in the traditional approach but has more control in IPD, even if they were to defer to the contractor.

==Architect-led design–build projects==
Architect-led design–build projects are those in which interdisciplinary teams of architects and building trades professionals collaborate in an agile management process, where design strategy and construction expertise are seamlessly integrated, and the architect, as owner-advocate, project-steward and team-leader, ensures high fidelity between project aims and outcomes.  In architect-led design–build projects, the architect works directly with the owner (the client), acts as the designer and builder, coordinating a team of consultants, subcontractors and materials suppliers throughout the project lifecycle.

Architects lead design–build projects in several ways, with varying degrees of responsibility (where "A/E" in each diagram represents the architect/engineer):

[[File:ALDB 3models.jpg|thumb|500px|center|alt=Three models of architect-led design–build | Three models of architect-led design–build]]

#Architect as provider of extended services: Contracted to the owner, the architect extends his or her services beyond the design phase, taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors on behalf of the owner. The architect bears similar risk but has more control over the project than in the traditional approach or on contractor-led design–build projects.
#Architect as primary party in architect-led integrated project delivery (IPD): Again, as in working together in a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. Again, the building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. This time, the architect leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the contractor might defer to the architect. The architect might bear more risk than they do in the traditional approach but risk is shared with the owner and the contractor, as outlined in their agreement. An alternative approach to effectuating this delivery structure is for the architect to contract directly with the owner to design and build the project, and then to subcontract the procurement and construction responsibilities to its allied general contractor, who enters into further subcontracts with the trades.  This is a difference in form, rather than in substance, because the business and legal terms of the agreement between the architect and the general contractor may be the same regardless of whether they are characterized as a joint venture or as a subcontract.  It is the "flip side of the coin" of the contractor-led approach described above in which the general contractor subcontracts the design to the architect.
#Architect as full service leader of design build process: Contracted to the owner, the architect offers full service to the owner, taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors, consultants and vendors, and involving them throughout the project, start to finish, from design through construction. The architect's role shifts during the project, from designer to site supervisor (effectively taking the role of a general contractor), but monitors the project vision, and is able to call upon subcontractors' construction expertise throughout. The architect bears the greatest risk but also has more control over the project than in either the traditional approach, or in the contractor-led and other architect-led design–build projects.

==Contracts==
A single set of integrated contracts combining design and construction responsibilities, rather than two discrete contracts for each, acknowledges the interdependence of the architects' and construction trades' project responsibilities, and reduces the likelihood of disputes.&lt;ref name="Dorwin"&gt;[http://www.fldbia.org/Documents/AIA%20DB%20%20Dorwin%20Thomas%20presentation.pdf ''Advanced Design-Build Strategies for Architects'' by Dorwin A.J. Thomas, DBIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321180400/http://www.fldbia.org/Documents/AIA%20DB%20%20Dorwin%20Thomas%20presentation.pdf |date=March 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design–build institutes==
In 1993, the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbia.org/|title=Home|work=dbia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed. Its membership is composed of design and construction industry professionals as well as project owners. DBIA promotes the value of design–build project delivery and teaches the effective integration of design and construction services to ensure success for owners and design and construction practitioners. The Design-Build Institute of America is an organization that defines, teaches and promotes best practices in design–build.

The Canadian Design-Build Institute (CDBI) describes itself as "The recognized voice of Design-Build practitioners in Canada, promoting and enhancing the proper utilization of Design-Build method of procurement and contracting"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbi.org/|title=Canadian Design-Build Institute — Promoting and enhancing the design-build industry – where creativity and construction meet|work=cdbi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy===
Not all design–build projects are alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/resources/conteduc/archives/0511edit-1.asp  ''Hopes and Fears of Design–build'', Nancy Solomon, Architectural Record, November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, there is a distinction between design–build projects led by contractors and those led by architects. Architect-led Design Build is a form of 'design–build' that, according to the DBIA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbia.org Design Build Institute of America, or ''DBIA'']&lt;/ref&gt; has been rapidly gaining market share in the United States over the past 15 years. The Design Build Institute of America describes the design–build process as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Taking singular responsibility, the design–build team is accountable for cost, schedule and performance, under a single contract and with reduced administrative paperwork, clients can focus on the project rather than managing disparate contracts. And, by closing warranty gaps, building owners also virtually eliminate litigation claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The DBIA's 2005 chart shows the uptake of design–build methods in non-residential design and construction in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ ''What is Design Build?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511113024/http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ |date=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architect-led design–build is sometimes known by the more generic name "designer-led design–build". Although employed primarily by architects, [[architectural technologists]] and other architectural professions, the design–build structure works similarly for interior design projects led by an [[interior designer]] who is not an architect, and also for engineering projects where the design–build team is led by a professional structural, civil, mechanical or other [[engineers]]. In addition, it is common for the design professional who leads the design–build team to create a separate corporation or similar business entity through which the professional performs the construction and other related non-professional services.

Design–build continues to gain ground as a significant trend in design and construction today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdbmagazine.com/print/Residential-Design-and-Build/Architects-Should-Be-Leading-DesignBuild-Projects/1$4416 ''Architects Should Be Leading Design-build Projects'', by Luis Jauregui Residential Design Build magazine, October 2010]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208140939/http://www.rdbmagazine.com/print/Residential-Design-and-Build/Architects-Should-Be-Leading-DesignBuild-Projects/1%244416 |date=February 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, industry consultants ZweigWhite published "Design-Bid-Build meets the opposition".&lt;ref&gt;The Zweig Letter, ISSN 1068-1310, issue 902&lt;/ref&gt; In it, they suggest that while Design-Bid-Build "still rules", the traditional approach is losing favor as "alternative project delivery methods threaten [the] design-bid-build model." While not referencing the architect-led design–build approach specifically, the article states that D/B already accounts for 27% of projects, according to their 2010 Project Management Survey and goes on to argue that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The emerging trends in delivery seem to point to a return to the primordial concept of the masterbuilder, as exemplified by D/B and IPD [Integrated Project Delivery].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the DBIA, the design–build approach offers advantages to owners, including:
"One team, one contract, one unified flow of work from initial concept through completion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511113024/http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}{{cite web|url=http://www.westoverconstruction.com/Design_Build.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822011537/http://www.westoverconstruction.com/Design_Build.html |archivedate=2012-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate on the merits of design–build vs. design–bid–build==
[[File:dbbtimeline.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Traditional Design Bid Build|Design-Bid-Build project timeline]]
[[File:aldbtimeline.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Architect-led Design Build Timeline| ALDB project timeline]]

The rise of design–build project delivery has threatened the traditional hierarchies and silos of the design and construction industry. As a result, a debate has emerged over the value of design–build as a method of project delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructiondigital.com/architectural_design/designbuild-vs-architecture-firms|title=Design/Build VS. Architecture Firms|work=Architectural Design|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611204820/http://www.constructiondigital.com/architectural_design/designbuild-vs-architecture-firms|archivedate=2011-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the design–build approach claim that design–build limits the clients’ involvement in the design and allege that contractors often make design decisions outside their area of expertise. They also suggest that a designer—rather than a construction professional—is a better advocate for the client or project owner and/or that by representing different perspectives and remaining in their separate spheres, designers and builders ultimately create better buildings.

Proponents of design–build counter that design–build saves time and money for the owner, while providing the opportunity to achieve innovation in the delivered facility. They note that value is added because design-build brings [[value engineering]] into the design process at the onset of a project. Design–build allows the contractor, engineers and specialty trade contractors (subcontractors) to propose best-value solutions for various construction elements before the design is complete. Design–build brings all members of a project team together early in the process to identify and address issues of cost, schedule and constructability. Proponents suggest that as a result, design-build alleviates conflict between architects and contractors and reduces owner risk for design errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korteco.com/design-build|title=Design-Build: The Complete Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that once design is finalized and construction begins, the greatest opportunity to achieve cost savings has already been lost, and the potential for design errors is greater, leading to change orders that create cost growth and schedule delays. Proponents note that design–build allows owners to avoid being placed directly between the architect/engineer and the contractor. Under design–bid–build, the owner takes on significant risks because of that position. Design–build places the responsibility for design errors and omissions on the design–builder, relieving the owner of major legal and managerial responsibilities. The burden for these costs and associated risks are transferred to the design–build team.

The cost and schedule reduction and decreased litigation associated with design–build project delivery have been demonstrated repeatedly. Researches on ''Selecting Project Delivery Systems''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Victor Sanvido|author2=Mark Konchar|last-author-amp=yes|title=Project Delivery Systems: CM at Risk, Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build|journal=Construction Industry Institute Research Report|date=April 1998|pages=133–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Victor Sanvido and Mark Konchar of Pennsylvania State University found that design–build projects are delivered 33.5% faster than projects that are designed and built under separate contracts (design-bid-build). Sanvido and Konchar also showed that design–build projects are constructed 12% faster* and have a unit cost that is 6.1% lower than design-bid-build projects. Similar cost and time savings were found in a comparison study of design–build, and design-bid-build for the water/wastewater construction industry, a peer-reviewed paper authored by Smith Culp Consulting that will be published in July 2011 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/6/prweb8563707.htm|title=New Report Describes Time and Cost Savings From Design Build Project Delivery|date=13 June 2011|work=PRWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; A benchmarking and claims study by Victor O. Schinnerer, one of the world's largest firms underwriting professional liability and specialty insurance programs, found that, from 1995–2004, only 1.3% of claims against A/E firms were made by design–build contractors. Advantages have been summarized as:

* Efficiency: Typically led by contractors, 'design–build' has evolved as an efficient way to deliver projects primarily where the building project goals are straightforward, either constrained by budget, or the outcome is prescribed by functional requirements (for example, a highway, sports facility, or brewery). Construction industry commentators have described design–build as a high performance 'construction project delivery system', a dynamic approach to making buildings that presents an alternative to the traditional design-bid-build approach.
* Single-source: Design–build is growing because of the advantages of single-source management: Unlike traditional design-bid-build, it allows for the owner to contract with just one party who acts as a single point of contact, is responsible for delivering the project and coordinates the rest of the team.  Depending on the phasing of the project, there may be multiple sequential contracts between the owner and the design–builder.  the owner benefits because if something turns out to be wrong with the project, there is a single entity that is responsible for fixing the problem, rather than a separate designer and constructor each blaming the other.

===Advantages for less-presciptive projects===
Architect-led design–build is suited primarily to less prescriptive architectural projects (private residences, non-profit institutions, museums), for the efficiencies it yields and the sophisticated design interpretation it affords, particularly:
* Where the primary project goals are design-driven or visionary rather than prescribed by budgetary constraint or functional requirements
* Where the project is specifically "Capital A"-artistically/creatively driven, in a way that traditionally yields the highest level of cost overruns.
* Where the efficiencies of design–build approach and an architect's interpretive skill are equally important

These less prescriptive projects need not be stuck with the "broken buildings and busted budgets"&lt;ref&gt;LePatner, Barry.  "Broken Buildings, Busted Budgets: How to Fix America's Trillion-Dollar Construction Industry". The University of Chicago Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; described by Barry Lepatner. Rather, the less prescriptive the project, the more the client needs an architect to steward an emergent design from vision to completion. So it follows that for the broadest range of building projects, the rigors of architect-led design–build is compelling and preferable where design is of paramount importance to the client.

===Recursive knowledge===
The process and the knowledge it produces is recursive: Since subcontractors are engaged early and often in an architect-led design build project, to assess efficiencies, opportunity costs, payback rates and quality options. Their input informs overall design decisions from the outset. Cost-benefit is also a constant consideration that informs design decisions from the outset. Building performance is measured early too, so that trade offs between budget, schedule, functionality and usability can inform specification and continuous refinement of the design.

Architects engaged in this dynamic process understand and keep up to date with the potential of contemporary technology&lt;ref&gt;''An Enthusiastic Sceptic'' by Nat Oppenheimer, Architectural Design (2009) Volume: 79, Issue: 2, Pages: 100–105, an assessment of Building Information Management (BIM) software&lt;/ref&gt; and materials available to building professionals, and translate what they learn into their design work. This knowledge is fed back, not just to the specific project but can be shared to other project teams, throughout a studio, or more broadly to the profession, and can become an active source of insight in and of itself.

==Growth of design–build method==
A 2011 study analyzing the design–build project delivery method in the United States shows design–build was used on about 40 percent of non-residential construction projects in 2010, a ten percent increase since 2005. The study was commissioned by the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) and was completed by RSMeans Reed Construction Data Market Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbia.org/resource-center/Pages/Report-by-RCD-RSMeans-Market-Intelligence.aspx|title=Report by Reed Construction Data/RSMeans Market Intelligence|work=dbia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from the US Department of Transportation claims that: "Design-build delivery has been steadily increasing in the U.S. public building sector for more than 10 years, but it is still termed experimental in transportation. To date, under Special Experimental Project 14 (SEP-14) the FHWA has approved the use of design–build in more than 150 projects, representing just over half of the States. The European countries visited have used design–build delivery for a longer time than the United States and provided the scan team with many valuable insights. The primary lessons learned on this scan tour relate to the types of projects utilizing design–build, the use of best-value selection, percentage of design in the solicitation, design and construction administration, third-party risks, the use of warranties, and the addition of maintenance and operation to design–build contracts."&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, International Programs, [http://international.fhwa.dot.gov/contractadmin/04.cfm Chapter 4 – Contract Administration: Technology and Practice in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of design–build==
During the design–build procedure, the contractor is deciding on design issues as well as issues related to cost, profits and time exigencies. Whilst the traditional method of construction procurement dissociates the designers from the contractors’ interests, design–build does not. On these grounds it is considered that the design–build procedure is poorly adapted to projects that require complex designs for technical, programmatic or aesthetic purposes.
If the designer/architect is 'kept' by the construction company, they probably will never push the envelope as to what might be possible.
A notable design–build project that received significant criticism, not only for excessive cost but for environmental issues, was the [[Belmont Learning Center]].  The scandal involved alleged contaminated soil that caused significant delays and massive cost overruns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SCANDAL+FIGURES+SAY+THEY+FOLLOWED+LAUSD+ORDERS-a083613230] Belmont scandal&lt;/ref&gt;  In Los Angeles, District Attorney Steve Cooley, who investigated the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]]’s Belmont project, produced a final investigative report, released March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://da.lacounty.gov/pdf/BLC_Final_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527094735/http://da.lacounty.gov/pdf/BLC_Final_Report.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }} Los Angeles DA, Steve Cooley final Investigate report on Belmont&lt;/ref&gt;  This report concluded that the design–build process caused a number of issues relating to the Belmont scandal:

* Design–build does not make use of competitive bidding where prospective builders bid on the same design.
* Criteria to select contractor are subjective and difficult to evaluate and to justify later.
* The design and price selected arouses public suspicion, true or not.
* This can lead to loss of public confidence.
* The design brief is subject to different interpretations from both the client and contractor, creating a conflict of interest.

It concluded the “design–build” approach and “mixed-use concept” together caused controversy, uncertainty, and complexity of the Belmont project which helped increase the potential for project failure. While the Belmont investigation cleared the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] of any criminal wrongdoing, the task force recommends strict oversight, including written protocols, a vigorous Office of the Inspector General, and other recommendations if it decides to continue to use the design–build approach. During the period in question, the ex-Superintendent of LAUSD, [[Ramon C. Cortines]], working with the LAUSD Board of Education, whose president is Monica Garcia, actively tried to cut the Office of Inspector General by 75% (compromising on 25%) and subsequently removed the Inspector General Jerry Thornton after he produced critical audits that showed misuse of construction funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.com/search/ci_12615104?IADID=Search-www.dailynews.com-www.dailynews.com] Daily News – LAUSD watchdog office to be cut by 25%&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that architect-led design–build still does:&lt;ref name="Dorwin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://designbuild.construction.com/features/archive/2005/0506_feature2.asp ''AIA Teaching Architects To Lead Design-Build Teams'' by Tom Nicholson, Design and Construction, May/June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schiffhardin.com/design-build/designer-led.html "Designer-led Design-Build" by Mark Friedlander, Schiff Hardin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028015012/http://www.schiffhardin.com/design-build/designer-led.html |date=October 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Typical project management issues (establishing liability, writing contracts, scoping estimates and schedule) or
* Variation across different states' licensing laws or
* Conflict of interest and ethical issues

It also imposes:
* Greater business and financial risks associated with architect taking on general contractor responsibilities
* Changes to the way architects do business, so they
** Establish a construction company as a separate corporation that signs a separate construction contract, so they are able to insure and simplify liability insurance coverage
** Either they have, or are able to acquire, the skills of a design–builder
** Recognize the parties' different incentives
** Modify how they prepare Contract Documents, relying more on performance specifications than they do currently, to facilitate substitutions for the benefit of the constructor.

== Radiation fractionation as cancer treatment ==
Fractionation effects are utilised in the treatment of [[cancer]] with [[radiation therapy]]. When the total dose of [[radiation]] is divided into several, smaller doses over a period of several days, there are fewer [[toxic]] effects on healthy cells. This maximizes the effect of radiation on cancer and minimizes the negative [[side effects]]. A typical fractionation scheme divides the dose into 30 units delivered every weekday over six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Radiotherapy dose fractionation, second edition |url=https://www.rcr.ac.uk/publication/radiotherapy-dose-fractionation-second-edition |website=[[The Royal College of Radiologists]] |language=en |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=Bleddyn |last2=Morgan |first2=David AL |editor1-last=Dale |editor1-first=Roger G. |editor2-last=Jones |editor2-first=Bleddyn |title=Radiobiological modelling in radiation oncology |date=2007 |publisher=British Institute of Radiology |location=London |isbn=9780905749600 |chapter=Radiotherapy fractionation|doi=10.1259/9780905749839.chapter04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hypofractionation''' is a treatment regimen that delivers higher doses of radiation in fewer visits. The logic behind this treatment is that applying greater amounts of radiation works to lower the effects of accelerated tumor growth that typically occurs during the later stages of radiotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;Pollack, Alan, and Mansoor Ahmed . Hypofractionation: Scientific Concepts and Clinical Experiences. 1st. Ellicot City: LimiText Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperfractionation''' is dividing the same total dose into more deliveries. Treatments are given more than once a day. Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time (days or weeks) as standard radiation therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hyperfractionated radiation therapy |url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/hyperfractionated-radiation-therapy |website=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms |publisher=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=9 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Accelerated fractionation''' (two deliveries per day and/or deliveries on weekends as well) has also been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Accelerated-fraction radiation therapy|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/accelerated-fraction-radiation-therapy |website=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms |publisher=National Cancer Institute |accessdate=9 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6004">'''Eco-investing''' or '''green investing''', is a form of [[socially responsible investing]] where investments are made in companies that support or provide [[environmentally friendly]] products and practices. These companies encourage (and often profit from) new technologies that support the transition from carbon dependence to more sustainable alternatives.&lt;ref name=chow&gt;{{Cite web|last=Henshaw |first=Mark |title=Eco Investor Guide |publisher=Eco Investor Guide, Inc. |year=2010 |url=http://www.ecoinvestorguide.com/wp-content/uploads/EcoInvestorGuide.pdf |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As industries' environmental impacts become more apparent, green topics have not only taken center stage in pop culture, but the financial world as well. In the 1990s many investors “began to look for those companies that were better than their competitors in terms of managing their environmental impact.” While some investors still focus their funds to avoid only “the most egregious polluters,” the emphasis for many investors has switched to changing “the way money is used,” and using “it in a positive, transformative way to get us from where we are now ultimately to a truly sustainable society.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Keane |first=Robert F. |title=The Green Advisor: SRI &amp; Green Investing Grow Up |publisher=Investment Advisor |date=1 November 2009 |url=http://www.advisorone.com/2009/11/01/the-green-advisor-sri-green-investing-grow-up |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Climate Prosperity Scoreboard – launched by Ethical Markets Media and The Climate Prosperity Alliance to monitor private investments in green companies – estimated that over $1.248 trillion has been invested in solar, wind, geothermal, ocean/hydro and other green sectors since 2007. This number represents investments from [[North America]], [[China]], [[India]], and [[Brazil]], as well at other developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=New Global Climate Prosperity Scoreboard Finds Over $1 Trillion Invested in Green Since 2007 |publisher=Green Money Journal |year=2010 |url=http://www.greenmoneyjournal.com/article.mpl?newsletterid=51&amp;articleid=749 |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eco/Green Investing versus Socially Responsible Investing==
While many eco-investments may be considered socially responsible investments, and vice versa, the two are not mutually inclusive. [[Socially responsible investing]] is the practice of investing only in those companies which satisfy certain moral or ethical criteria. This may include companies with an interest in the environment, but also supports various other social and religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Socially Responsible Investing |publisher=Investor Glossary |url=http://www.investorglossary.com/socially-responsible-investing.htm |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-investing narrows in on the interests of sustainable environmental issues. Specifically, eco-investments focus on companies who work on renewable energy and clean technologies.

==Eco-investing sectors==
There are several sectors that fall under the eco-investing umbrella. [[Renewable energy]] refers to both solar, wind, tidal current,wave and conventional hydro technology. This includes companies that build [[solar panel]]s or [[wind turbine]]s, or the raw materials and services that contribute to these technologies&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt; It also refers to Energy Storage – companies that develop and use technologies to store large amounts of energy, particularly renewable energies. A good example of this is the fuel cells used in [[hybrid car]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Green Technology &amp; Alternative Fuels |publisher=Demand Media, Inc. |url=http://www.greencar.com/alternative-fuels-green-technology.php |accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also under the renewable energy sector are Biofuels. This group includes companies that use or supply biological resources (like algae, corn or waster wood) to create energy or fuel. Other technologies that are included in the renewable energy group are: Geothermal (companies who use or convert heat to electric energy) and Hydroelectricity (companies who harness water energy to make electricity).&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

The Buildings and Efficiency sector refers to companies that manufacture green building materials or energy-efficient services in the world of engineering and architecture. Green building materials include energy-efficient glass, insulation, and lighting among others. Recycling companies and energy conservation companies also fall under this sector.&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

The Eco Living sector refers to companies that offer sustainable goods and services for healthy living. This includes organic farming, green pesticides, health care and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="chow"/&gt;

Green investment has significantly grown in the UK and there are now 136 funds listed on the [http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/library Worldwise Investor fund library] under the themes: Agriculture, Carbon, Clean Energy, Forestry, Environmental, Multi-thematic and Water. All of these funds account for around [http://www.worldwiseinvestor.com/knowledge/reports?fd=%2527%2582%25F9%25B8%257F%25C5%2500%25BB%25E3%25B61sXm%25F1%259E%2584%252FK%2591%250E-%25F2%25B1x0L%25DFW%25B9%25C2Z%250Bf%2589%2501%25CCY%25C1%25D1%259A%2594%25E7%25C92s%25C5 £21.8bn] in the UK.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3416">In [[logic]], [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], especially [[metalogic]] and [[computability theory]], an '''effective method'''&lt;ref name="metalogic"&gt;[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Hunter, Geoffrey]], ''Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic'', University of California Press, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; or '''effective procedure''' is a procedure for solving a problem from a specific class. An effective method is sometimes also called '''mechanical''' method or procedure.&lt;ref name=alanturingnet&gt;{{cite web|last=Copeland|first=B.J.|title=The Turing-Church Thesis|url=http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/reference%20articles/The%20Turing-Church%20Thesis.html|work=AlanTuring.net|publisher=Turing Archive for the History of Computing|date=June 2000|accessdate=23 March 2013|authorlink=Jack Copeland |author2=Copeland, Jack |author3=Proudfoot, Diane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The definition of an effective method involves more than the method itself. In order for a method to be called effective, it must be considered with respect to a class of problems. Because of this, one method may be effective with respect to one class of problems and ''not'' be effective with respect to a different class.

A method is formally called effective for a class of problems when it satisfies these criteria:
* It consists of a finite number of exact, finite instructions.
* When it is applied to a problem from its class:
** It always finishes (''terminates'') after a finite number of steps.
** It always produces a correct answer.
* In principle, it can be done by a human without any aids except writing materials.
* Its instructions need only to be followed [[Rigour|rigorously]] to succeed. In other words, it requires no [[ingenuity]] to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, ''effective procedure''&lt;/ref&gt;

Optionally, it may also be required that the method never returns a result as if it were an answer when the method is applied to a problem from ''outside'' its class. Adding this requirement reduces the set of classes for which there is an effective method.

==Algorithms==
An effective method for calculating the values of a function is an [[algorithm]]. Functions for which an effective method exists are sometimes called '''effectively calculable'''.

==Computable functions==
Several independent efforts to give a formal characterization of effective calculability led to a variety of proposed definitions ([[Recursion|general recursion]], [[Turing machine]]s, [[λ-calculus]]) that later were shown to be equivalent. The notion captured by these definitions is known as [[Computable function|recursive or effective computability]].

The [[Church-Turing thesis]] states that the two notions coincide: any [[number-theoretic function]] that is effectively calculable is [[computable function|recursively computable]]. As this is not a mathematical statement, it cannot be proven by a [[mathematical proof]].

'''Effective safety training''' is an unofficial phrase used to describe the training materials designed to teach [[occupational safety and health]] standards developed by the United States government labor organization, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). OSHA has produced many standards and regulations that affect employers and employees in the United States.  United States employers have a legal responsibility to educate employees on all [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] standards and the hazards that their employees may face while on the job, and providing effective safety training meets that responsibility.

==Introduction==

Employers must have an overall safety program including relative site specific safety information where applicable.   The safety training program should cover topics such as:&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;Lawrence(J.D.), Barnett (2000). ''Safety Management Handbook: CCH Safety Professional Series''. Vol. 2 pg.9301–9307. Health and Human Resources, Chicago, IL&lt;/ref&gt;
*accident prevention and safety promotion
*safety compliance
*accident and emergency response
*personal protective equipment
*safety practices
*equipment and machinery
*chemical and hazardous materials safety
*workplace hazards
*employee involvement

Employers must document all training.  Creating a training matrix will help keep track of who has been trained, when they were trained, the training topic, and when it is time for refresher training. Employees must also sign an official sign-in sheet provided by the employer that can serve as proof that employees received proper training.  The sign in sheet must have a broad description of what is being covered in the training. Tests or quizzes on the presented material can help gauge employee understanding of the material and highlight topics that need to be reviewed.

The non-English speaking population is consistently growing in many industries and it is important that employers provide bilingual training for those workers, as OSHA requires that '''all employees''' be properly trained.

Most employees display attitudes of disinterest and dread at the thought of attending a safety training, which can leave the trainer feeling frustrated and unappreciated.  It is the trainer's duty to make safety training fun and educational, which will help the trainees to retain the information, enjoy the course, and apply the learning to their work and lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyer, Barbara; Veasey, Alan; Oldfield, Kenneth; Craft-McCormick, Lisa (2000) ''Effective Safety and Health Training'', CRC Press {{ISBN|1-56670-396-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of a training program==

An effective training program can reduce the number of injuries and [[occupational fatality|deaths]], property damage, legal liability, illnesses, workers' compensation claims, and missed time from work.  An effective safety training program can also help a trainer keep the required OSHA-mandated safety training courses organized and up-to-date.
Safety training classes help establish a safety culture in which employees themselves help promote proper safety procedures while on the job. It is important that new employees be properly trained and embrace the importance of workplace safety as it is easy for seasoned workers to negatively influence the new hires. That negative influence however, can be purged with the establishment of new, hands-on, innovative effective safety training which will ultimately lead to an effective safety culture. A 1998 [[NIOSH]] study concluded that the role of training in developing and maintaining effective hazard control activities is a proven and successful method of intervention.&lt;ref&gt;NIOSH (1998). ''Assessing Occupational Safety and Health Training: a Literature Review'', NIOSH Publication No. 98-145&lt;/ref&gt;

==OSHA's voluntary training guidelines==

OSHA issued voluntary training guidelines in 1992.  These guidelines serve as a model for trainers to use in developing, organizing, evaluating, and editing their safety training programs.  It is important for trainers to tailor the OSHA guidelines to their specific work site so that the training is relevant to the specific working conditions and not just a long generalized informational session.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many standards promulgated by OSHA explicitly require the employer to train employees in the safety and health aspects of their jobs. Other OSHA standards make it the employer's responsibility to limit certain job assignments to employees who are "certified," "competent," or "qualified"—meaning that they have had special previous training, in or out of the workplace. The term "designated" personnel means selected or assigned by the employer or the employer's representative as being qualified to perform specific duties. These requirements reflect OSHA's belief that training is an essential part of every employer's safety and health program for protecting workers from injuries and illnesses.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;US Department of Labor. ''Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines''. OSHA 2254 1998 (Revised). https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha2254.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

OSHA's training guidelines follow a model that consists of:

*A. Determining if Training is Needed
*B. Identifying Training Needs
*C. Identifying Goals and Objectives
*D. Developing learning activities
*E. Conducting the training
*F. Evaluating program effectiveness
*G. Improving the program
*H. Training must align with job tasks.
**'''A. Determining if training is needed'''
You first have to determine if a situation can be solved using training. Training, or retraining as the case may be, could be required by an OSHA standard.  Training is an effective solution to problems such as employee lack of understanding, unfamiliarity with equipment, incorrect execution of a task, lack of attention, or lack of motivation.  Sometimes, however, the situation cannot be mitigated through the use of training and other methods, such as the establishment of engineering controls, may be needed to ensure worker safety.

**'''B. Identifying training needs'''
A [[job safety analysis]] and/or a [[job hazard analysis]] should be conducted with every employee so that it is understood what is needed to do the job safely and what hazards are associated with the job.  A safety trainer may observe the worker in his/her environment to adequately assess the worker's training needs.  Certain employees may need extra training due to the hazards associated with their particular job.  These employees should be trained not only on
how to perform their job safely but also on how to operate within a hazardous
environment.

**'''C. Identifying Goals and Objectives'''
It is important for the Trainer to identify necessary training material.  It is equally important that the trainer identify training material that is not needed to avoid unnecessary training and frustration from their trainees.

At the beginning of every safety training session the trainer should clearly iterate the objectives of the class.  The objectives should be delivered using action oriented words like:  the employee ..."will be able to demonstrate" or "will know when to"... which will help the audience understand what he/she should know by the end of the class or what to information to assimilate during the class. Clearly established objectives also help focus the evaluation process on those skill sets and knowledge requirements necessary to perform the job safely.

**'''D. Developing Learning Activities'''
Training should be hands-on and simulate the job as closely as possible.  Trainers can use instructional aids such as charts, manuals, PowerPoint presentations, and films.  Trainers can also include role-playing, live demonstrations, and round-table group discussions to stimulate employee participation. Games like "what's wrong with this picture" (it is usually good to use pictures of situations found at their specific location)" or "safety jeopardy" can be useful ways to make the training fun yet educational.

**'''E. Conducting the Training'''
Trainers should provide employees with an overview of the material to be learned and relate the training to the employees' experiences.  Employers should also reinforce what the employees have learned by summarizing the program's objectives and key points of training.  At the beginning of the training program, the trainer should show the employees why the material is important and relevant to their jobs.  Employees are more likely to pay attention and apply what they've learned if they know the benefits of the training.&lt;ref name="Barnett"/&gt;

**'''F. Evaluating Program Effectiveness'''
Evaluation will help employers or supervisors determine the amount of learning achieved and whether an employee's performance has improved on the job. Among the methods of evaluating training are:&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; 
***(1) Student opinion. Questionnaires or informal discussions with employees can help employers determine the relevance and appropriateness of the training program
***(2) Supervisors' observations.  Supervisors are in good positions to observe an employee's performance both before and after the training and note improvements or changes
***(3) Workplace improvements. The ultimate success of a training program may be changes throughout the workplace that result in reduced injury or accident rates
*** (4) Formal assessments.  Practical and written exams also assist in evaluating understanding of training material.  For example, for a lift-truck operator, a written and a practical exam would identify areas of training that may need to be revisited.  Furthermore administering a pre-test and post-test will establish a knowledge base line or reference point to measure training effectiveness.
**'''G. Improving the Program'''
As evaluations are reviewed, it may be evident the training was not adequate and that the employees did not reach the expected level of knowledge and skill.  As the program is evaluated, the trainer should ask:&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; 
***(1) If a job analysis was conducted, was it accurate?
***(2) Was any critical feature of the job overlooked?
***(3) Were the important gaps in knowledge and skill included?
***(4) Was material already known by the employees intentionally omitted?
***(5) Were the instructional objectives presented clearly and concretely?
***(6) Did the objectives state the level of acceptable performance that was expected of employees?
***(7) Did the learning activity simulate the actual job?
***(8) Was the learning activity appropriate for the kinds of knowledge and skills required on the job?
***(9) When the training was presented, was the organization of the material and its meaning made clear?
***(10) Were the employees motivated to learn?
***(11) Were the employees allowed to participate actively in the training process?
***(12) Was the employer's evaluation of the program thorough?

==Computer and video training==

Computers and videos can be a great addition to a company's safety training program. As stand alone resources, they may not be adequate in meeting OSHA's training requirements as they are not site specific. Computer-based training can help meet the following training challenges&lt;ref&gt;Hubiak, Stacy (1998). "Click On to Effective Training," ''Safety and Health Magazine'', Sept., pg.116&lt;/ref&gt;
*Training employees in remote sites
*Employees who become bored with the same safety training
*Safety managers lack of time and resources to effectively train employees
*Providing a means of documenting and tracking student progress
*Lowering trainer fees or travel costs
*A self-paced, relaxed learning environment

==OSHA Medical Safety==

There is no more important places to regard the positive impact the OSHA regulations than in the healthcare and clinical settings. OSHA has been revolutionary in the medical field due to its ability to prevent the spread of diseases. Every clinical facility on US land, civilian or military is governed by OSHA's directives. To remain in accordance to the Federal regulations enacted by OSHA healthcare administrators must maintain an OSHA safety program and train their employees on an annual basis. Some of the topics that employees must be trained on include:
* Bloodborne Pathogen Standard
* Chemical Hazard Communications
* Tuberculosis Exposure Control
* Mercury Exposure
* Ionizing Radiation Exposure
* Fire Escape Plan
* Emergency Action Plan
* Electricity Safety
* Fire Safety Standard

It was created in 2009 and developed by ESA according to agreements between the agency and the United Kingdom in 2012. About 100 ESA employees were expected to work in Harwell by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://fr.scribd.com/doc/261462085/Plans-for-ECSAT-ESA-in-Harwell | title = Plans for ECSAT - ESA in Harwell | publisher = [[European Space Agency]] | date = 5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would support activities linking space to telecommunications, integrated applications, climate change, technology and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://fr.scribd.com/doc/261462073/ECSAT-Achievements-and-Perspectives | title = ECSAT Achievements and Perspectives | publisher = European Space Agency | date = 4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new ESA-only building, which would include advanced concepts on sustainability and use of natural energy sources, would be constructed on the campus.

The development of ECSAT was in line with the growing efforts of the United Kingdom in the space sector, including the creation of the [[UK Space Agency]]  in 2010 and the increase in the economic contribution of that country to the ESA. At the same time, the ESA benefited from a closer relation with the UK space sector and corrected an historical anomaly whereby the United Kingdom, while being one of the biggest ESA contributors, did not host any of the agency’s major centers.

There is an earlier ESA facility on the campus, the ESA Business Incubation Centre (BIC) Harwell, which is intended to assist in the development of technology transfer ideas, helping to transform them into viable businesses.

ECSAT hosts the ESA Climate Office, responsible for defining and implementing ESA's Climate Change Initiative Programme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cci.esa.int | title = Climate Change Initiative | publisher = European Space Agency | date = 29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evolutionary musicology''' is a subfield of [[biomusicology]] that grounds the psychological mechanisms of [[music perception]] and [[music production (music psychology)|production]] in [[evolutionary theory]]. It covers [[Animal communication|vocal communication]] in non-human animal species, theories of the evolution of human music, and cross-cultural human universals in musical ability and processing.

== History ==
The origins of the field can be traced back to [[Charles Darwin]] who wrote in his [[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|Descent of Man]]:
: "When we treat of sexual selection we shall see that primeval man, or rather some early progenitor of man, probably first used his voice in producing true musical cadences, that is in singing, as do some of the gibbon-apes at the present day; and we may conclude from a widely-spread analogy, that this power would have been especially exerted during the courtship of the sexes,—would have expressed various emotions, such as love, jealousy, triumph,—and would have served as a challenge to rivals.  It is, therefore, probable that the imitation of musical cries by articulate sounds may have given rise to words expressive of various complex emotions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|authorlink=[[Charles Darwin]]|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|year=1871|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/dscmn10.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory of a musical protolanguage has been revived and re-discovered repeatedly, often without attribution to Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Origins of Music|year=2000|publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |author=Nils L. Wallin, Björn Merker, and Steven Brown (Editors)|isbn=0-262-23206-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Mithen, ''The Singing Neanderthals: the Origins of Music, Language, Mind and Body'', Harvard University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The origins of music ==
{{See also|Prehistoric music|Music archaeology|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
Two major topics for any subfield of [[evolutionary psychology]] are the adaptive function (if any) and phylogenetic history of the mechanism or behavior of interest including when music arose in human ancestry and from what ancestral traits it developed. Current debate addresses each of these.

One part of the adaptive function question is whether music constitutes an evolutionary [[adaptation]] or [[exaptation]] (i.e. by-product of evolution). [[Steven Pinker]], in his book ''[[How the Mind Works]]'', for example, argues that music is merely "auditory [[cheesecake]]"—it was evolutionarily adaptive to have a preference for fat and sugar but cheesecake did not play a role in that selection process.

Adaptation, on the other hand, is highlighted in hypotheses such as the one by Edward Hagen and Gregory Bryant which posits that human music evolved from animal territorial signals, eventually becoming a method of signaling a group's social cohesion to other groups for the purposes of making beneficial multi-group alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagen|first=Edward H|author-link=|last2=Bryant|first2=Gregory A|author2-link=|title=Music and dance as a coalition signaling system|journal=Human Nature|volume=14|issue=1|pages=21–51|year=2003|url=http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~hagen/papers/music.pdf|doi=10.1007/s12110-003-1015-z|id=|access-date=3 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612013500/http://itb.biologie.hu-berlin.de/~hagen/papers/music.pdf|archive-date=12 June 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hagen |first=Edward H |author2=Hammerstein P |year=2009 |title=Did Neanderthals and other early humans sing?

===The bipedalism hypothesis===
The evolutionary switch to bipedalism may have influenced the origins of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Self-generated sounds of locomotion and ventilation and the evolution of human rhythmic abilities|journal=Animal Cognition|date=August 2013|doi=10.1007/s10071-013-0678-z|volume=17|pages=1–14|pmc=3889703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The background is that noise of locomotion and ventilation may mask critical auditory information. Human locomotion is likely to produce more predictable sounds than those of non-human primates. Predictable locomotion sounds may have improved our capacity of entrainment to external rhythms and to feel the beat in music. A sense of rhythm could aid the brain in distinguishing among sounds arising from discrete sources and also help individuals to synchronize their movements with one another. Synchronization of group movement may improve perception by providing periods of relative silence and by facilitating auditory processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Possible functions of the octavolateralis system in fish schooling|journal=Fish and Fisheries|year=2009|volume=10|pages=344–355|doi=10.1111/j.1467-2979.2009.00330.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larsson|first=Matz|title=Incidental sounds of locomotion in animal cognition|journal=Animal Cognition|year=2012|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.1007/s10071-011-0433-2|pmc=3249174}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive value of such skills to early human ancestors may have been keener detection of prey or stalkers and enhanced communication. Thus, bipedal walking may have influenced the development of entrainment in humans and thereby the evolution of rhythmic abilities. Primitive hominids lived and moved around in small groups. The noise generated by the locomotion of two or more individuals can result in a complicated mix of footsteps, breathing, movements against vegetation, echoes, etc. The ability to perceive differences in pitch, rhythm, and harmonies, i.e. “musicality,” could help the brain to distinguish among sounds arising from discrete sources, and also help the individual to synchronize movements with the group. Endurance and an interest in listening might, for the same reasons, have been associated with survival advantages eventually resulting in adaptive selection for rhythmic and musical abilities and reinforcement of such abilities. Listening to music seems to stimulate release of dopamine. Rhythmic group locomotion combined with attentive listening in nature may have resulted in reinforcement through dopamine release. A primarily survival-based behavior may eventually have attained similarities to [[dance]] and music, due to such reinforcement mechanisms . Since music may facilitate social cohesion, improve group effort, reduce conflict, facilitate perceptual and motor skill development, and improve trans-generational communication,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huron|first=David|title=Is music an evolutionary adaptation?|journal=Ann N Y Acad Sci|year=2001|volume=930|pages=43–61|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2001.tb05724.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; music-like behavior may at some stage have become incorporated into human culture.

Another proposed adaptive function is creating intra-group bonding. In this aspect it has been seen as complementary to language by creating strong positive emotions while not having a specific message people may disagree on. Music's ability to cause [[Entrainment (biomusicology)|entrainment]] (synchronization of behavior of different organisms by a regular beat) has also been pointed out. A different explanation is that signaling fitness and creativity by the producer or performer in order to attract mates. Still another is that music may have developed from human mother-infant auditory interactions ([[motherese]]) since humans have a very long period of infant and child development, infants can perceive musical features, and some infant-mother auditory interaction have resemblances to music.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 45 Music and cognitive evolution.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the problem in the debate is that music, like any complex cognitive function, is not a holistic entity but rather [[Modularity of mind|modular]]&lt;ref&gt;Fodor, Jerry A. (1983). Modularity of Mind: An Essay on Faculty Psychology. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-56025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;—perception and production of [[rhythm]], [[melody|melodies]], [[harmony]] and other musical parameters may thus involve multiple cognitive functions with possibly quite distinct evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;Honing, H. (ed.) (2018). The Origins of Musicality. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Musilanguage hypothesis ===
{{Undue weight section|date=August 2011}}
"Musilanguage" is a term coined by Steven Brown to describe his hypothesis of the ancestral human traits that evolved into language and musical abilities. It is both a model of musical  and linguistic evolution and a term coined to describe a certain stage in that evolution. Brown argues that both music and human language have origins in a  "musilanguage" stage of evolution and that the structural features shared by music and language are not the results of mere chance parallelism, nor are they a function of one system emerging from the other. This model argues that "music emphasizes sound as emotive meaning and language emphasizes sound as referential meaning."&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown S|veditors=Wallin NL, Merker B, Brown S |date=1999-12-03|chapter=The "Musilanguage" Model of Music Evolution|title=The Origins of Music|isbn=0-262-23206-5|publisher=The MIT Press|pages=271&amp;ndash;301}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musilanguage model is a structural model of music evolution, meaning that it views music's acoustic properties as effects of homologous precursor functions.  This can be contrasted with functional models of music evolution, which view music's innate physical properties to be determined by its adaptive roles.

The musilanguage evolutionary stage is argued to exhibit three properties found in both music and language: lexical tone, combinatorial phrase formation, and expressive phrasing mechanisms.  Many of these ideas have their roots in existing phonological theory in linguistics, but Brown argues that phonological theory has largely neglected the strong mechanistic parallels between melody, phrasing, and rhythm in speech and music. 
::Lexical tone refers to the pitch of speech as a vehicle for semantic meaning.  The importance of pitch to conveying musical ideas is well-known, but the linguistic importance of pitch is less obvious.  [[Tone (linguistics)|Tonal language]]s such as Thai and Cantonese, wherein the lexical meaning of a sound depends heavily on its pitch relative to other sounds, are seen as evolutionary artifacts of musilanguage.  Non-tonal, or "intonation" languages, which do not depend heavily on pitch for lexical meaning, are seen as evolutionary late-comers which have discarded their dependence on tone.  Intermediate states, known as [[pitch accent]] languages, which exhibit some lexical dependence on tone, but also depend heavily on intonation, are exemplified by [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language]].

::Combinatorial formation refers to the ability to form small phrases from different tonal elements.  These phrases must be able to exhibit melodic, rhythmic, and semantic variation, and must be able to combine with other phrases to create global [[melodic formula]]s capable of conveying emotive meaning.  Examples in modern speech would be the rules for arranging letters to form words and then words to form sentences.  In music, the notes of different scales are combined according to their own unique rules to form larger musical ideas.

::Expressive [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] is the device by which expressive emphasis can be added to the phrases, both at a local (in the sense of individual units) and global (in the sense of phrases) level.  There are numerous ways this can occur in both speech and music that exhibit interesting parallels.  For instance, the increase in the amplitude of a sound being played by an instrument accents that sound much the same way that an increase in amplitude can emphasize a particular point in speech.  Similarly, speaking very rapidly often creates a frenzied effect that mirrors that of a fast and agitated musical passage.

===AVID model of music evolution===
[[Joseph Jordania]] has suggested that music (as well as several other universal elements of contemporary human culture, including [[dance]] and [[body painting]]) was part of a predator control system used by early [[hominids]]. He suggested that rhythmic loud singing and drumming, together with the threatening rhythmic body movements and body painting, was the core element of the ancient "Audio-Visual Intimidating Display" (AVID).&lt;ref&gt;Jordania J. ''[[Who Asked the First Question?]] The Origins of Human Choral Singing, Intelligence, Language and Speech'' (2006) Logos&lt;/ref&gt; AVID  was also a key factor in putting the hominid group into a specific [[altered state of consciousness]] which he calls  "battle trance" where they would not feel fear and pain, and would be religiously dedicated to group interests. Jordania suggested that listening and dancing to the sounds of loud rhythmic rock music, used in many contemporary combat units before the combat missions is directly related to this.&lt;ref&gt;Jordania, J. (2009) ''Times to fight and times to relax: Singing and humming at the beginning of Human evolutionary history'' 1: 272-277&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the defense from predators, Jordania suggested that this system was the core strategy to obtain food via confrontational, or aggressive [[scavenging]].

Apart from loud rhythmic singing-stomping-dancing, Jordania also suggested that soft [[humming]] could have played an important role in the early human ([[hominid]]) evolution as [[contact calls]]. Many [[social animals]] produce seemingly haphazard and indistinctive sounds (like chicken cluck) when they are going about their everyday business ([[foraging]], feeding). These sounds have two functions: (1) to let group members know that they are among kin and there is no danger, and (2) in case of the appearance of any signs of danger (suspicious sounds, movements in a forest), the animal that notices danger first, stops moving, stops producing sounds, remains silent and looks in the direction of the danger sign. Other animals quickly follow suit and very soon all the group is silent and is scanning the environment for the possible danger. [[Charles Darwin]] was the first to notice this phenomenon on the example of the wild horses and the cattle.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. ''Descent of Men'', 2004:123&lt;/ref&gt; Jordania suggested that for humans, as for many [[social animals]], silence can be a sign of danger, and that's why gentle humming and musical sounds relax humans (see the use of gentle music in [[music therapy]], [[lullaby|lullabies]])

 | footer = Both in this celestial coordinate system, and in the system to describe a nucleophile approaching a planar electrophile, the problem is to uniquely describe the location of a point off of a plane, relative to specific point on the plane (here '''plane I''', the plane containing the [[carbonyl]] and its '''R''' and '''R'''' substituents, likewise with other electrophiles). ''Hence, in both cases, the problem can be addressed using two angles, an altitude-type angle and an azimuth-type angle.'' (A third component of description is [[stereochemistry|stereochemical]], i.e., indicating whether approach is from above or below the electrophile plane, see following.)

The nucelophile (atom or group) is represented here as ''':Nu'''. The substituents,  '''R''' and '''R'''', attached to the carbon atom of the [[carbonyl]] group may be an atom such as hydrogen (H), [[alkyl group]]s such as [[methyl]], [[Ethyl group|ethyl]], etc. (including far more complex ones), or other [[functional group]]s such as the O- and N-containing groups of [[ester]]s and [[amide]]s. In both panels, a second plane, '''plane II''' (red), is defined that is [[orthogonal]] (perpendicular) to the first, con-taining the carbon and oxygen atoms of the [[carbonyl]], C=O, and [[bisection|bisecting]] the '''R&lt;big&gt;—•—&lt;/big&gt;R'''' angle (where the "•" is the carbon atom). A third plane, mutually orthogonal to the first two, '''plane III''' (green), contains only the carbon atom of the carbonyl; it corresponds to the plane of the page in the Newman projection at right. In that projection, the '''vector''' (arrow) pointing from :Nu to the carbon of the carbonyl is mirrored across plane I to make clear that the nucleophile can approach from either above or below this plane (with resulting differences in the stereochemistry of reaction products, see text). The dotted line from :Nu to plane I indicates the computational process of [[Projection (mathematics)|mathematically projecting]] the geometric point representing :Nu onto plane I, which is sometimes a necessary maths operation (see text).

Note, for sake of clarity of presentation in the image at left, the nucleophile and azimuthal angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;, are shown as displaced toward the R substiuent, while in the Newman projection, the opposite is the case. In this article, the R substituent is arbitrarily being assigned to the more [[steric bulk|sterically bulky]] group, and so the displacement shown at right is most representative of the phenomena described throughout. Note also, while elevation in celestial applications is most easily measured as the specific altitude shown, the elevation of the nucleophile, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt;, is most easily measured as the [[Angle#Combining angle pairs|supplementary]] angle, Nu-C-O, hence its values are most often &gt;90° (see text).

The '''Flippin–Lodge angle''' is one of two angles used by [[organic chemistry|organic]] and [[biochemistry|biological chemist]]s studying the relationship between a molecule's [[chemical structure]] and ways that it [[chemical reactivity|reacts]], for reactions involving "attack" of an electron-rich reacting species, the [[nucleophile]], on an electron-poor reacting species, the [[electrophile]]. Specifically, the angles—the [[Bürgi–Dunitz angle|Bürgi–Dunitz]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt;, and the Flippin–Lodge, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;—describe the "trajectory" or "angle of attack" of the nucleophile as it approaches the electrophile, in particular when the latter is [[Trigonal planar molecular geometry|planar]] in shape. This is called a [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction and it plays a central role in the [[biochemistry|biological chemistry]] taking place in many [[biosynthesis|biosyntheses]] in nature, and is a central "tool" in the reaction toolkit of modern organic chemistry, e.g., to construct new molecules such as [[pharmaceuticals]]. Theory and use of these angles falls into the areas of [[synthetic chemistry|synthetic]] and [[physical organic chemistry]], which deals with [[chemical structure]] and [[reaction mechanism]], and within a sub-specialty called ''structure correlation''.

Because chemical reactions take place in [[three dimensional|three dimensions]], their quantitative description is, in part, a [[Euclidean geometry|geometry]] problem. Two angles, first the Bürgi–Dunitz angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt;, and later the Flippin–Lodge angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;, were developed to describe the approach of the reactive [[atom]] of a nucleophile (a point off of a plane) to the reactive atom of an electrophile (a point on a plane). The &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; is an angle that estimates the displacement of the nucleophile, at its elevation, toward or away from the particular R and R' [[substituent]]s attached to the electrophilic atom (see image). The &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; is the angle between the approach vector connecting these two atoms and the plane containing the electrophile (see the [[Bürgi–Dunitz angle|Bürgi–Dunitz]] article). Reactions addressed using these angle concepts use nucleophiles ranging from single atoms (e.g., chloride [[anion]], [[chloride|Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]]) and polar organic [[functional group]]s (e.g., [[primary amine]]s, R"-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), to complex [[chiral catalyst]] reaction systems and [[enzyme]] [[active site]]s. These nucleophiles can be paired with an array of planar electrophiles: [[aldehyde]]s and [[ketone]]s, [[Carboxylic Acid Derivatives#Carbonyl compounds|carboxylic acid-derivatives]], and the carbon-carbon double bonds of [[alkene]]s. Studies of &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; can be theoretical, based on [[Molecular orbital|calculations]], or experimental (either quantitative, based on [[X-ray crystallography]], or inferred and semiquantitative, rationalizing results of particular chemical reactions), or a combination of these.

The most prominent application and impact of the Flippin–Lodge angle has been in the area of chemistry where it was originally defined: in practical [[organic synthesis|synthetic]] studies of the outcome of carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions in solution.  An important example is the [[aldol reaction]], e.g., addition of ketone-derived nucleophiles ([[enol]]s, [[enolate]]s), to electrophilic [[aldehyde]]s that have attached groups varying in size and polarity. Of particular interest, given the [[three-dimensional]] nature of the concept, is understanding how the combined features on the nucleophile and electrophile impact the [[stereochemistry]] of reaction outcomes (i.e., the "handedness" of new  [[chiral]] centers created by a reaction). Studies invoking Flippin–Lodge angles in synthetic chemistry have improved the ability of chemists to predict outcomes of known reactions, and to design better reactions to produce particular stereoisomers ([[enantiomer]]s and [[diastereomer]]s) needed in the construction of complex natural products and drugs.

==Technical introduction==
The Flippin–Lodge (FL) angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; is the latter-derived of two angles that fully define the geometry of "attack" (approach via collision) of a [[nucleophile]] on a [[trigonal]] [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] center of an [[electrophile|electrophilic]] [[molecule]] (the second being the Bürgi–Dunitz angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt;, see below).&lt;ref name=Fleming2010&gt;Ian Fleming (2010) Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions: Student Edition, John Wiley and Sons, pp. 158-160; see also Ian Fleming (2010) Molecular Orbitals and Organic Chemical Reactions: Reference Edition, John Wiley and Sons, pp.&amp;nbsp;214–215, {{ISBN|0470746580}}, [https://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Orbitals-Organic-Chemical-Reactions/dp/0470746599], accessed 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; Theory and application of these angles falls into the area of [[synthetic chemistry|synthetic]], and of [[physical organic chemistry]] (in the specializations of [[chemical structure]] and [[reaction mechanism]]), in the latter, within a sub-specialty called ''structure correlation''.&lt;ref name = Cieplak08&gt;{{cite book | authors = Cieplak, A.S. | year = 2008 | orig-year = 1994 | chapter = Organic Addition and Elimination Reactions; Transformation Paths of Carbonyl Derivatives [Ch. 6] | title =  Structure Correlation, Vol. 1 | pages = 205-302, esp. 270-274 | editors = Bürgi, Hans-Beat &amp; Dunitz, Jack D. | location = Weinheim, GER | publisher = VCH | isbn = 352761608X | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=352761608X | access-date = 1 March 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of  &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; can be theoretical, based on [[Molecular orbital|calculations]], or experimental (either quantitative, based on [[X-ray crystallography]], or inferred and semiquantitative, rationalizing results of particular chemical reactions), or a combination of these.&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt;&lt;ref name = Cieplak08/&gt;

Nucleophiles in this [[addition reaction]] may range from single atoms ([[hydride]], [[chloride]]), to polar organic [[functional group]]s ([[amine]]s, [[alcohol]]s), to complex systems (nucleophilic [[enolate]]s with [[chiral catalyst]]s, [[amino acid]] [[side chain]]s in [[enzyme]] [[active site]]s; see below).

== Angle as experimental observable ==
These angles are best construed to mean the angles observed (measured) for a given system, and ''not'' an historically observed range in values (e.g., as in the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; range of the original Bürgi–Dunitz aminoketones), or an idealized value computed for a particular system (such as the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; = 0° for hydride addition to formaldehyde).&lt;ref name=BurgiDunitzTet74/&gt; That is, the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; angles of the hydride-formadehyde system have one pair of values, while the angles observed for other systems—combinations of nucelophile and electrophile, in combination with catalyst and other variables that define the experimental condition, including whether the reaction is ''in solutio'' or otherwise—are fully ''expected'' (and are reported) to vary, at least somewhat, from the theoretical, symmetric hydride-formaldehyde case.&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=RadiskyKoshland2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=RadKoshExplanNote/&gt;

A stated ''convention for &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;'' is that it is ''positive (&gt;0°) when it deviates in direction:''
* ''away from the larger substituent'' attached to the electrophilic center, &lt;u&gt;''or''&lt;/u&gt;
* ''away from the more electron-rich substituent'' (where these two and other factors can be in a complex competition, see below); 
hence, as noted, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; for reaction of a simple nucleophile with a symmetrically substituted carbonyl (R = R', or other symmetric planar electrophile) is expected to be 0° ''in vacuo'' or ''in solutio'', e.g., as in the case of the computed and experimental addition of hydride (H&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) to formaldehyde (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=O).&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;

In contrast to the Bürgi–Dunitz angle, [[Bürgi–Dunitz angle|&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt;]],&lt;ref name=BurgiDunitzTet74/&gt; and using the case of carbonyl additions as example: the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; angle adopted during an approach by the nucleophile to a trigonal electrophile depends in complex fashion on:
* the relative steric size of the two substituents attached to (alpha to) the electrophilic carbonyl, which give rise to varying degrees of repulsive van der Waals's interactions (e.g., giving &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 7° for [[hydride]] attack on [[pivaldehyde]] (see image), where R=''tertiary''-butyl, and R'=H),&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;
* the electronic characteristics of substituents alpha to the carbonyl, where heteroatom-containing substituents can, through their [[stereoelectronic]] influence, function as overly intrusive steric groups (e.g., giving &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 40-50° for esters and amides with small R' groups, since R is an O- and N-substituent, respectively),&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt; and
* the nature of the bonds made by more distant atoms to the atoms alpha to the carbonyl, e.g., where the energy of the σ* molecular orbital (MO) between the alpha- and beta-substituents was seen to compete with the foregoing influences,&lt;ref name=LodgeHeathcock1987/&gt;
as well as on the MO shapes and occupancies of the carbonyl and attacking nucleophile.&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; Hence, the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{BD}&lt;/math&gt; observed for nucleophilic attack appears to be influenced primarily by the energetics of the HOMO-LUMO overlap of the nucleophile-electrophile pair in the systems studied—see the [[Bürgi–Dunitz angle|Bürgi–Dunitz]] article, and the related inorganic chemistry concept of the angular overlap model (AOM)&lt;ref&gt;While the AOM is almost uniformly applied to inorganic cases, per [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition it applies to main group elements as well, see Minkin, op. cit., and this extension is explicitly covered in the text and other writings of the late Prof. Jeremy Burdett, et. op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Minkin, V.

==Origin and current scope of concept==
Bürgi–Dunitz angle theory was initially developed based on "frozen" interactions in crystals,&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt;{{rp|124ff}}&lt;ref name=BurgiDunitzTet74/&gt; while most chemistry takes place via collisions of molecules tumbling in solution; remarkably, the theories of the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;, with the complexity they reflect, evolved not from crystallographic work, but from studying reaction outcomes in such practical reactions as addition of [[enolate]]s to aldehydes (e.g., in study of diastereoselection in particular [[aldol]] reactions).&lt;ref name=Heathcock1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; In applying both angles of the nucleophile trajectory to real chemical reactions, the HOMO-LUMO centered view of the Bürgi-Dunitz angle, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{DB}&lt;/math&gt;, is modified to include further complex, electrophile-specific attractive and repulsive  [[electrostatic]] and [[van der Waals interaction]]s that can alter &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{DB}&lt;/math&gt; and bias &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; toward one substituent or the other (see above).&lt;ref name=LodgeHeathcock1987/&gt; As well, dynamics are at play in each system (e.g., changing [[torsional angle]]s) and are implicitly included in studies of reaction outcomes in solution, as in the early studies of &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=LodgeHeathcock1987/&gt;—though not in crystallographic structure correlation approaches as gave birth to the BD concept.

Finally, in constrained environments (e.g., in [[enzyme]] and [[nanomaterial]] binding sites), these angles, when characterized, appear to be quite distinct, an observation conjectured to arise because reactivity is not based on random collision, and so the relationship between orbital overlap principles and reactivity is more complex.&lt;ref name=RadiskyKoshland2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=RadKoshExplanNote/&gt;&lt;ref name=LightEtal14&gt;S.H.

The Flippin-Lodge and Bürgi-Dunitz angles were central, practically, to the development of a clearer understanding of [[asymmetric induction]] during nucleophilic attack at hindered carbonyl centers in synthetic organic chemistry. It was in this area that &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; was first defined by Heathcock, and has been primarily used.&lt;ref name=Heathcock1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; Larger substituents around the electrophilic center, such as tert-butyls, lead to higher stereoselectivities in asymmetric induction than smaller substituents like methyls. The trajectory of the nucleophile approaching a center flanked by two large substituents is more limited, i.e. the Flippin–Lodge angle is smaller. For example, in [[Mukaiyama aldol addition]], the bulkier phenyl tert-butyl ketone has a higher selectivity for the ''syn'' isomer than the smaller phenyl methyl ketone. Likewise, if bulky a nucleophile, such as a t-butylmethylsilyl enolate, is used, the selectivity is higher than for a small nucleophile like a lithium enolate.&lt;ref name="Flippin1983"/&gt;

Given a reaction system of a given nucleophile with a carbonyl having the two substituents R and R', where substituent R' is [[steric]]ally small relative to substituent R (e.g., R' = hydrogen atom, R = phenyl), the &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt; values that are inferred from the reaction outcomes and theoretical studies tend to be larger;{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} alternatively, if the hydrocarbon substituents are nearer or equal in [[steric]] size, the inferred &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{FL}&lt;/math&gt;values diminish and may approach zero (e.g., R' = ''tert''-butyl, R = phenyl).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Thus, from the perspective of simpler electrophile systems where only steric bulk come into play, the attack trajectories of the classes of nucleophiles studied makes clear that as the disparity in size between the substituent increase, there is a perturbation in the FL angle that can be used to provide higher stereoselectivities in designed reaction systems;{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} while the patterns become more complex when factors other than steric bulk come into play (see section above on orbital contributions),&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=LodgeHeathcock1987/&gt; Flippin, Lodge, and Heathcock were able to show that generalizations could be made that were useful to reaction design.&lt;ref name=Heathcock1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt;

A surpassing area of application has been in studies of various [[aldol reaction]]s, the addition of ketone-derived [[enol]]/[[enolate]] nucleophiles to electrophilic [[aldehyde]]s, each with functional groups varying in size and group polarity;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; the way that features on the nucleophile and electrophile impact the [[stereochemistry]] seen in reaction products, and in particular, the [[diastereomer|diastereoselection]] exhibited, has been carefully mapped (see the steric and orbital description above,&lt;ref name=Heathcock1990/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleming2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=GawleyAube1996/&gt; the [[aldol reaction]] article, and David Evans' related Harvard teaching materials on the aldol&lt;ref&gt;Evans, D.A., et al.

[[Image:Gene Regulatory Network 2.jpg|thumb|right|360px|Control process of a gene regulatory network]]

A '''gene''' (or '''genetic''') '''regulatory network''' ('''GRN''') is a collection of molecular regulators that interact with each other and with other substances in the cell to govern the [[gene expression]] levels of [[mRNA]] and proteins. These play a central role in [[morphogenesis]], the creation of body structures, which in turn is central to [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo).

The regulator can be [[DNA]], [[RNA]], [[protein]] and complexes of these. The interaction can be direct or indirect (through transcribed RNA or translated protein). In general, each mRNA molecule goes on to make a specific protein (or set of proteins). In some cases this protein will be [[Protein#Structural proteins|structural]], and will accumulate at the cell membrane or within the cell to give it particular structural properties. In other cases the protein will be an [[enzyme]], i.e., a micro-machine that catalyses a certain reaction, such as the breakdown of a food source or toxin. Some proteins though serve only to activate other genes, and these are the [[transcription factors]] that are the main players in regulatory networks or cascades. By binding to the [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] region at the start of other genes they turn them on, initiating the production of another protein, and so on. Some transcription factors are inhibitory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=DH Latchman|title=Inhibitory transcription factors|journal=Biochem Cell Biol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In single-celled organisms, regulatory networks respond to the external environment, optimising the cell at a given time for survival in this environment. Thus a yeast cell, finding itself in a sugar solution, will turn on genes to make enzymes that process the sugar to alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transcriptional Regulatory Networks in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' |publisher=Young Lab |url= http://web.wi.mit.edu/young/regulator_network/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, which we associate with wine-making, is how the yeast cell makes its living, gaining energy to multiply, which under normal circumstances would enhance its survival prospects.

In multicellular animals the same principle has been put in the service of gene cascades that control body-shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davidson E, Levin M |title=Gene regulatory networks |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=102 |issue=14 |pages=4935 |date=April 2005 |pmid=15809445 |pmc=556010 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0502024102 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/102/14/4935|last2=Levin |bibcode=2005PNAS..102.4935D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each time a cell divides, two cells result which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which genes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a 'self-sustaining feedback loop' ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of [[epigenetics]] by which [[chromatin]] modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of [[morphogen]] gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product that leaves the cell and [[diffusion|diffuses]] through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold level. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other [[morphogens]] that signal back to the original cell. Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of [[signal transduction]]. Such signalling controls [[embryogenesis]], the building of a [[body plan]] from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through [[feedback]] processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in [[cancer]]. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make [[Protein#Structural proteins|structural protein]]s that give each cell the physical properties it needs.

== Overview ==

At one level, biological cells can be thought of as "partially mixed bags" of biological chemicals – in the discussion of gene regulatory networks, these chemicals are mostly the [[messenger RNA]]s (mRNAs) and [[protein]]s that arise from gene expression. These mRNA and proteins interact with each other with various degrees of specificity. Some diffuse around the cell. Others are bound to [[cell membrane]]s, interacting with molecules in the environment. Still others pass through cell membranes and mediate long range signals to other cells in a multi-cellular organism. These molecules and their interactions comprise a ''gene regulatory network''. A typical gene regulatory network looks something like this:

[[Image:DG Network in Hybrid Rice.png|thumb|right|540px|Example of a regulatory network]]

The nodes of this network can represent genes, proteins, mRNAs, protein/protein complexes or cellular processes. Nodes that are depicted as lying along vertical lines are associated with the cell/environment interfaces, while the others are free-floating and can [[diffusion|diffuse]]. Edges between nodes represent interactions between the nodes, that can correspond to individual molecular reactions between DNA, mRNA, miRNA, proteins or molecular processes through which the products of one gene affect those of another, though the lack of experimentally obtained information often implies that some reactions are not modeled at such a fine level of detail. These interactions can be inductive (usually represented by arrowheads or the + sign), with an increase in the concentration of one leading to an increase in the other, inhibitory (represented with filled circles, blunt arrows or the minus sign), with an increase in one leading to a decrease in the other, or dual, when depending of the circumstances the regulator can activate or inhibit the target node. The nodes can regulate themselves directly or indirectly, creating feedback loops, which form cyclic chains of dependencies in the topological network. The network structure is an abstraction of the system's molecular or chemical dynamics, describing the manifold ways in which one substance affects all the others to which it is connected. In practice, such GRNs are inferred from the biological literature on a given system and represent a distillation of the collective knowledge about a set of related biochemical reactions. To speed up the manual curation of GRNs, some recent efforts try to use text mining, curated databases, network inference from massive data, model checking and other information extraction technologies for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Leitner, Martin Krallinger, Sushil Tripathi, Martin Kuiper, Astrid Lægreid and Alfonso Valencia, Mining cis-Regulatory Transcription Networks from Literature, Proceedings of BioLINK Special Interest Group, 5–12, ISBM/ECCB, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Genes can be viewed as nodes in the network, with input being proteins such as [[transcription factor]]s, and outputs being the level of [[gene expression]]. The value of the node depends of a function which depends in the value of its regulators in previous time steps (in the Boolean network described below these are [[Boolean functions]], typically AND, OR, and NOT). These functions have been interpreted as performing a kind of [[information processing]] within the cell, which determines cellular behavior. The basic drivers within cells are concentrations of some proteins, which determine both spatial (location within the cell or tissue) and temporal (cell cycle or developmental stage) coordinates of the cell, as a kind of "cellular memory". The gene networks are only beginning to be understood, and it is a next step for biology to attempt to deduce the functions for each gene "node", to help understand [[systems biology|the behavior of the system]] in increasing levels of complexity, from gene to signaling pathway, cell or tissue level.&lt;ref&gt;Azpeitia, E., Muñoz, S., González-Tokman, D., Martínez-Sánchez, M. E., Weinstein, N., Naldi, A., ... &amp; Mendoza, L. (2017). The combination of the functionalities of feedback circuits is determinant for the attractors’ number and size in pathway-like Boolean networks. Scientific Reports, 7, 42023.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathematical model]]s of GRNs have been developed to capture the behavior of the system being modeled, and in some cases generate predictions corresponding with experimental observations. In some other cases, models have proven to make accurate novel predictions, which can be tested experimentally, thus suggesting new approaches to explore in an experiment that sometimes wouldn't be considered in the design of the protocol of an experimental laboratory. Modeling techniques include [[differential equation]]s (ODEs), [[Boolean network]]s, [[Petri net]]s, [[Bayesian network]]s, [[graphical Gaussian model]]s, [[Stochastic]], and [[Process calculus|Process Calculi]]. Conversely, techniques have been proposed for generating models of GRNs that best explain a set of [[time series]] observations. Recently it has been shown that ChIP-seq signal of Histone modification are more correlated with transcription factor motifs at promoters in comparison to RNA level.&lt;ref&gt;Vibhor Kumar, Masafumi Muratani, Nirmala Arul Rayan, Petra Kraus, Thomas Lufkin, Huck Hui Ng and Shyam Prabhakar, Uniform, optimal signal processing of mapped deep-sequencing data, Nature Biotechnology, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Hence it is proposed that time-series histone modification ChIP-seq could provide more reliable inference of gene-regulatory networks in comparison to methods based on expression levels.

== Structure and evolution ==

=== Global feature ===
Gene regulatory networks are generally thought to be made up of a few highly connected [[node (graph theory)|node]]s ([[network topology|hubs]]) and many poorly connected nodes nested within a hierarchical regulatory regime. Thus gene regulatory networks approximate a [[Network topology|hierarchical]] [[Scale-free network|scale free network]] topology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barabasi | first1 = A. | last2 = Oltvai | first2 = Z. N. | year = 2004 | title =Network biology: understanding the cells' functional organization | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 101–113 | doi=10.1038/nrg1272| pmid = 14735121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the view that most genes have limited [[pleiotropy]] and operate within regulatory [[Modularity (biology)|modules]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wagner, G. P.  |author2=J. Zhang |date=2011 |title=The pleiotropic structure of the genotype-phenotype map: the evolvability of complex organisms |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=12 |pages=204–213 |doi=10.1038/nrg2949}}&lt;/ref&gt; This structure is thought to evolve due to the [[preferential attachment]] of [[Gene duplication|duplicated genes]] to more highly connected genes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent work has also shown that natural selection tends to favor networks with sparse connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robert D Leclerc |title=Survival of the sparest: robust gene networks are parsimonious |journal=Molecular Systems Biology |volume=4 |pages=213 |date= August 2008 |pmc=2538912 |doi=10.1038/msb.2008.52 |url=http://msb.embopress.org/content/4/1/213.long |pmid=18682703 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are primarily two ways that networks can evolve, both of which can occur simultaneously. The first is that network topology can be changed by the addition or subtraction of nodes (genes) or parts of the network (modules) may be expressed in different contexts. The'' [[Drosophila]]'' [[Hippo signaling pathway]] provides a good example. The Hippo signaling pathway controls both mitotic growth and post-mitotic cellular differentiation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jukam | last2 = Xie | first2 = D. B. | last3 = Rister | first3 = J. | last4 = Terrell | first4 = D. | last5 = Charlton-Perkins | first5 = M. | last6 = Pistillo | first6 = D. | last7 = Gebelein | first7 = B. | last8 = Desplan | first8 = C. | last9 = Cook | first9 = T.

This suggests that the Hippo signaling pathway operates as a conserved regulatory module that can be used for multiple functions depending on context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Thus, changing network topology can allow a conserved module to serve multiple functions and alter the final output of the network. The second way networks can evolve is by changing the strength of interactions between nodes, such as how strongly a transcription factor may bind to a cis-regulatory element. Such variation in strength of network edges has been shown to underlie between species variation in vulva cell fate patterning of ''[[Caenorhabditis]]'' worms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hoyos | first1 = E. | last2 = Kim | first2 = K. | last3 = Milloz | first3 = J. | last4 = Barkoulas | first4 = M. | last5 = Penigault | first5 = J. | last6 = Munro | first6 = E. | last7 = Felix | first7 = M. | year = 2011 | title = Quantitative variation in autocrine signaling and pathway crosstalk in the Caenorhabditis vulva network | journal = Current Biology | volume = 21 | issue = 7| pages = 527–538 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.02.040| pmid = 21458263 | pmc=3084603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Feed-forward motif.GIF|thumb|Feed-forward loop]]

Another widely cited characteristic of gene regulatory network is their abundance of certain repetitive sub-networks known as [[network motif]]s. Network motifs can be regarded as repetitive topological patterns when dividing a big network into small blocks. Previous analysis found several types of motifs that appeared more often in gene regulatory networks than in randomly generated networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Network motifs in the transcriptional regulation network of Escherichia coli |url=http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v31/n1/full/ng881.html|journal=Nature Genetics |date=2002-05-01 |issn=1061-4036 |pages=64–68|volume=31|issue=1|doi=10.1038/ng881|first=Shai S.|last=Shen-Orr|first2=Ron |last2=Milo |first3=Shmoolik |last3=Mangan |first4=Uri |last4=Alon |pmid=11967538}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Transcriptional Regulatory Networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/298/5594/799 |journal=Science |date=2002-10-25|issn=0036-8075 |pmid=12399584|pages=799–804 |volume=298|issue=5594 |doi=10.1126/science.1075090|first=Tong Ihn |last=Lee |first2=Nicola J. |last2=Rinaldi |first3=François |last3=Robert |first4=Duncan T. |last4=Odom |first5=Ziv|last5=Bar-Joseph |first6=Georg K.|last6=Gerber|first7=Nancy M.|last7=Hannett |first8=Christopher T. |last8=Harbison |first9=Craig M.|last9=Thompson|bibcode=2002Sci...298..799L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Comparative analysis of regulatory information and circuits across distant species |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v512/n7515/full/nature13668.html |journal=Nature |date=2014-08-28 |issn=0028-0836 |pmc=4336544 |pmid=25164757 |pages=453–456 |volume=512 |issue=7515 |doi=10.1038/nature13668|first=Alan P.|last=Boyle|first2=Carlos L. |last2=Araya |first3=Cathleen |last3=Brdlik|first4=Philip |last4=Cayting |first5=Chao |last5=Cheng|first6=Yong |last6=Cheng |first7=Kathryn |last7=Gardner |first8=LaDeana W. |last8=Hillier |first9=Judith |last9=Janette|bibcode=2014Natur.512..453B }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, one such motif is called feed-forward loops, which consist three nodes. This motif is the most abundant among all possible motifs made up of three nodes, as is shown in the gene regulatory networks of fly, nematode, and human.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The enriched motifs have been proposed to follow [[convergent evolution]], suggesting they are "optimal designs" for certain regulatory purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Convergent evolution of gene circuits|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ng1181|journal=Nature Genetics|date=2003-01-01|volume=34|issue=3|doi=10.1038/ng1181|first=Gavin C|last=Conant|first2=Andreas|last2=Wagner|pmid=12819781|pages=264–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, modeling shows that feed-forward loops are able to coordinate the change in node A (in terms of concentration and activity) and the expression dynamics of node C, creating different input-output behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Structure and function of the feed-forward loop network motif|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/21/11980|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2003-10-14|issn=0027-8424|pmc=218699|pmid=14530388|pages=11980–11985|volume=100|issue=21|doi=10.1073/pnas.2133841100|first=S.|last=Mangan|first2=U.|last2=Alon|bibcode=2003PNAS..10011980M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Incoherent Feedforward Loop Can Provide Fold-Change Detection in Gene Regulation |url=http://www.cell.com/article/S1097276509008594/abstract|journal=Molecular Cell|date=2009-11-12 |issn=1097-2765 |pmc=2896310 |pmid=20005851|pages=894–899|volume=36|issue=5 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2009.11.018 |first=Lea |last=Goentoro |first2=Oren |last2=Shoval|first3=Marc W.|last3=Kirschner |first4=Uri|last4=Alon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[galactose]] utilization system of ''[[E. coli]]'' contains a feed-forward loop which accelerates the activation of galactose utilization [[operon]] ''galETK'', potentially facilitating the metabolic transition to galactose when glucose is depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Incoherent Feed-forward Loop Accelerates the Response-time of the gal System of Escherichia coli |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283605015573|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |date=2006-03-10|pages=1073–1081 |volume=356|issue=5|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2005.12.003 |first=S.|last=Mangan |first2=S. |last2=Itzkovitz |first3=A. |last3=Zaslaver|first4=U.|last4=Alon |pmid=16406067}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feed-forward loop in the [[arabinose]] utilization systems of ''E.coli'' delays the activation of arabinose catabolism operon and transporters, potentially avoiding unnecessary metabolic transition due to temporary fluctuations in upstream signaling pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Coherent Feedforward Loop Serves as a Sign-sensitive Delay Element in Transcription Networks|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283603012038|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|date=2003-11-21 |pages=197–204|volume=334 |issue=2|doi=10.1016/j.jmb.2003.09.049 |first=S |last=Mangan |first2=A |last2=Zaslaver |first3=U|last3=Alon|pmid=14607112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in the Wnt signaling pathway of ''[[Xenopus]]'', the feed-forward loop acts as a fold-change detector that responses to the fold change, rather than the absolute change, in the level of β-catenin, potentially increasing the resistance to fluctuations in β-catenin levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Evidence that Fold-Change, and Not Absolute Level, of β-Catenin Dictates Wnt Signaling |url=http://www.cell.com/article/S1097276509008582/abstract|journal=Molecular Cell |date=2009-11-12 |issn=1097-2765 |pmc=2921914 |pmid=20005849 |pages=872–884|volume=36|issue=5 |doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2009.11.017 |first=Lea |last=Goentoro |first2=Marc W. |last2=Kirschner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the convergent evolution hypothesis, the enrichment of feed-forward loops would be an [[adaptation]] for fast response and noise resistance. A recent research found that yeast grown in an environment of constant glucose developed mutations in glucose signaling pathways and growth regulation pathway, suggesting regulatory components responding to environmental changes are dispensable under constant environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Whole Genome, Whole Population Sequencing Reveals That Loss of Signaling Networks Is the Major Adaptive Strategy in a Constant Environment |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003972|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=2013-11-21 |pmc=3836717 |pmid=24278038|pages=e1003972|volume=9|issue=11|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1003972|first=Daniel J.|last=Kvitek |first2=Gavin |last2=Sherlock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some researchers hypothesize that the enrichment of network motifs is non-adaptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The evolution of genetic networks by non-adaptive processes|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrg2192|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=2007-01-01|volume=8 |issue=10|doi=10.1038/nrg2192 |first=Michael|last=Lynch |pages=803–813}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, gene regulatory networks can evolve to a similar structure without the specific selection on the proposed input-output behavior. Support for this hypothesis often comes from computational simulations. For example, fluctuations in the abundance of feed-forward loops in a model that simulates the evolution of gene regulatory networks by randomly rewiring nodes may suggest that the enrichment of feed-forward loops is a side-effect of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Feed-Forward Loop Circuits as a Side Effect of Genome Evolution|url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/10/1931|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |date=2006-10-01|issn=0737-4038 |pmid=16840361|pages=1931–1936 |volume=23|issue=10|doi=10.1093/molbev/msl060|first=Otto X.|last=Cordero|first2=Paulien|last2=Hogeweg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another model of gene regulator networks evolution, the ratio of the frequencies of gene duplication and gene deletion show great influence on network topology: certain ratios lead to the enrichment of feed-forward loops and create networks that show features of hierarchical scale free networks.

== Modelling ==

=== Coupled ordinary differential equations ===
{{for|an example of modelling of the cell cycle with ODEs|cellular model}}

It is common to model such a network with a set of coupled [[ordinary differential equation]]s (ODEs) or [[Stochastic differential equation|SDE]]s, describing the reaction kinetics of the constituent parts. Suppose that our regulatory network has &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; nodes, and let &lt;math&gt;S_1(t),S_2(t), \ldots, S_N(t)&lt;/math&gt; represent the concentrations of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; corresponding substances at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Then the temporal evolution of the system can be described approximately by

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dS_j}{dt} = f_j \left (S_1,S_2, \ldots, S_N \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the functions &lt;math&gt; f_j &lt;/math&gt; express the dependence of &lt;math&gt;S_j&lt;/math&gt; on the concentrations of other substances present in the cell. The functions &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; are ultimately derived from basic [[rate equation|principles of chemical kinetics]] or simple expressions derived from these e.g. [[Michaelis-Menten]] enzymatic kinetics. Hence, the functional forms of the &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; are usually chosen as low-order [[polynomials]] or [[Hill equation (biochemistry)|Hill function]]s that serve as an [[ansatz]] for the real molecular dynamics. Such models are then studied using the mathematics of [[dynamical system|nonlinear dynamics]]. System-specific information, like [[reaction rate]] constants and sensitivities, are encoded as constant parameters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chu D, Zabet NR, Mitavskiy B |title=Models of transcription factor binding: sensitivity of activation functions to model assumptions |journal=J.

Biol. |volume=257 |issue=3 |pages=419–29 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19121637 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2008.11.026 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5193(08)00631-0|last2=Zabet |last3=Mitavskiy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By solving for the [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the system:

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{dS_j}{dt} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains (possibly several) concentration profiles of proteins and mRNAs that are theoretically sustainable (though not necessarily [[stability (mathematics)|stable]]). [[Steady state]]s of kinetic equations thus correspond to potential cell types, and [[Oscillation|oscillatory]] solutions to the above equation to naturally cyclic cell types. Mathematical stability of these [[attractor]]s can usually be characterized by the sign of higher derivatives at critical points, and then correspond to [[Steady state (biochemistry)|biochemical stability]] of the concentration profile. [[Critical point (mathematics)|Critical point]]s and [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]]s in the equations correspond to critical cell states in which small state or parameter perturbations could switch the system between one of several stable differentiation fates. Trajectories correspond to the unfolding of biological pathways and transients of the equations to short-term biological events. For a more mathematical discussion, see the articles on [[nonlinearity]], [[dynamical systems]], [[bifurcation theory]], and [[chaos theory]].

=== Boolean network ===
{{Main|Boolean network}}
The following example illustrates how a [[Boolean network]] can model a GRN together with its gene products (the outputs) and the substances from the environment that affect it (the inputs). [[Stuart Kauffman]] was amongst the first biologists to use the metaphor of Boolean networks to model genetic regulatory networks.&lt;ref name="kauffmanRBN"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Origins of Order| last=Kauffman| first=Stuart | year=1993 | isbn=0-19-505811-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kauffman SA |title=Metabolic stability and epigenesis in randomly constructed genetic nets |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |issue=3 |pages=437–467 |year=1969 |url=http://lis.epfl.ch/~markus/References/Kauffman69.pdf |pmid=5803332 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(69)90015-0 |volume=22 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Each gene, each input, and each output is represented by a node in a [[directed graph]] in which there is an arrow from one node to another if and only if there is a causal link between the two nodes.
# Each node in the graph can be in one of two states: on or off.
# For a gene, "on" corresponds to the gene being expressed; for inputs and outputs, "off" corresponds to the substance being present.
# Time is viewed as proceeding in discrete steps. At each step, the new state of a node is a [[Boolean function]] of the prior states of the nodes with arrows pointing towards it.

The validity of the model can be tested by comparing simulation results with time series observations. A partial validation of a Boolean network model can also come from testing the predicted existence of a yet unknown regulatory connection between two particular transcription factors that each are nodes of the model.&lt;ref name="pmid25398016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lovrics A, Gao Y, Juhász B, Bock I, Byrne HM, Dinnyés A, Kovács KA |title=Boolean modelling reveals new regulatory connections between transcription factors orchestrating the development of the ventral spinal cord |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=9 |issue=11 |pages=11430|date=November 2014 |pmid=25398016 |url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0111430 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0111430 |pmc=4232242|bibcode=2014PLoSO...9k1430L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuous networks ===

Continuous network models of GRNs are an extension of the boolean networks described above. Nodes still represent genes and connections between them regulatory influences on gene expression. Genes in biological systems display a continuous range of activity levels and it has been argued that using a continuous representation captures several properties of gene regulatory networks not present in the Boolean model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vohradsky J |title=Neural model of the genetic network |journal=J. Biol. Chem. |volume=276 |issue=39 |pages=36168–73 |date=September 2001 |pmid=11395518 |doi=10.1074/jbc.M104391200 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11395518}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Formally most of these approaches are similar to an [[artificial neural network]], as inputs to a node are summed up and the result serves as input to a sigmoid function, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geard N, Wiles J |title=A gene network model for developing cell lineages |journal=Artif. Life |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=249–67 |year=2005 |pmid=16053570 |doi=10.1162/1064546054407202 |last2=Wiles }}&lt;/ref&gt; but proteins do often control gene expression in a synergistic, i.e. non-linear, way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Schilstra MJ, Bolouri H |title=Modelling the Regulation of Gene Expression in Genetic Regulatory Networks |date=2 January 2002 |work= |publisher=Biocomputation group, University of Hertfordshire |url=http://strc.herts.ac.uk/bio/maria/NetBuilder/Theory/NetBuilderModelling.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013022705/http://strc.herts.ac.uk/bio/maria/NetBuilder/Theory/NetBuilderModelling.htm |archivedate=13 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is now a continuous network model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |vauthors=Knabe JF, Nehaniv CL, Schilstra MJ, Quick T |title=Evolving Biological Clocks using Genetic Regulatory Networks |booktitle=Proceedings of the Artificial Life X Conference (Alife 10) |pages=15–21 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2006 |location= |citeseerx = 10.1.1.72.5016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows grouping of inputs to a node thus realizing another level of regulation. This model is formally closer to a higher order [[recurrent neural network]]. The same model has also been used to mimic the evolution of [[cellular differentiation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |vauthors=Knabe JF, Nehaniv CL, Schilstra MJ |title=Evolutionary Robustness of Differentiation in Genetic Regulatory Networks |booktitle=Proceedings of the 7th German Workshop on Artificial Life 2006 (GWAL-7) |pages=75–84 |publisher=Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft Aka |year=2006 |location=Berlin |citeseerx = 10.1.1.71.8768 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and even multicellular [[morphogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |vauthors=Knabe JF, Schilstra MJ, Nehaniv CL |title=Evolution and Morphogenesis of Differentiated Multicellular Organisms: Autonomously Generated Diffusion Gradients for Positional Information |booktitle=Artificial Life XI: Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on the Simulation and Synthesis of Living Systems |pages= |publisher=MIT Press |year=2008 |location= |url=http://panmental.de/papers/FlagPottsGRNALife11.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stochastic gene networks ===

Recent (as of 2007) experimental results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elowitz MB, Levine AJ, Siggia ED, Swain PS |title=Stochastic gene expression in a single cell |journal=Science |volume=297 |issue=5584 |pages=1183–6 |date=August 2002 |pmid=12183631 |doi=10.1126/science.1070919 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12183631|last2=Levine |last3=Siggia |last4=Swain |bibcode=2002Sci...297.1183E }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blake WJ, KAErn M, Cantor CR, Collins JJ |title=Noise in eukaryotic gene expression |journal=Nature |volume=422 |issue=6932 |pages=633–7 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12687005 |doi=10.1038/nature01546 |url=http://www.bu.edu/abl/pdf/blake2003.pdf?file=/nature/journal/v422/n6932/full/nature01546_fs.html&amp;content_filetype=PDF |last2=Kaern |last3=Cantor |last4=Collins |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610071622/http://www.bu.edu/abl/pdf/blake2003.pdf?file=%2Fnature%2Fjournal%2Fv422%2Fn6932%2Ffull%2Fnature01546_fs.html&amp;content_filetype=PDF |archivedate=10 June 2012 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=2003Natur.422..633B }}&lt;/ref&gt; have demonstrated that gene expression is a stochastic process. Thus, many authors are now using the stochastic formalism, after the work by Arkin et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arkin A, Ross J, McAdams HH |title=Stochastic kinetic analysis of developmental pathway bifurcation in phage lambda-infected Escherichia coli cells |journal=Genetics |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=1633–48 |date=August 1998 |pmid=9691025 |pmc=1460268 |last2=Ross |last3=McAdams }}&lt;/ref&gt; Works on single gene expression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Raser JM, O'Shea EK |title=Noise in Gene Expression: Origins, Consequences, and Control |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5743 |pages=2010–3 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16179466 |pmc=1360161 |doi=10.1126/science.1105891 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16179466|last2=O'Shea |bibcode=2005Sci...309.2010R }}&lt;/ref&gt; and small synthetic genetic networks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elowitz MB, Leibler S |title=A synthetic oscillatory network of transcriptional regulators |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6767 |pages=335–8 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10659856 |doi=10.1038/35002125|last2=Leibler }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gardner TS, Cantor CR, Collins JJ |title=Construction of a genetic toggle switch in Escherichia coli |journal=Nature |volume=403 |issue=6767 |pages=339–42 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10659857 |doi=10.1038/35002131|last2=Cantor |last3=Collins }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the genetic toggle switch of Tim Gardner and [[James Collins (bioengineer)|Jim Collins]], provided additional experimental data on the phenotypic variability and the stochastic nature of gene expression. The first versions of stochastic models of gene expression involved only instantaneous reactions and were driven by the [[Gillespie algorithm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gillespie DT |title=A general method for numerically simulating the stochastic time evolution of coupled chemical reactions |journal=J. Comput. Phys. |volume=22 |pages=403–34 |year=1976 |doi=10.1016/0021-9991(76)90041-3 |issue=4|bibcode=1976JCoPh..22..403G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since some processes, such as gene transcription, involve many reactions and could not be correctly modeled as an instantaneous reaction in a single step, it was proposed to model these reactions as single step multiple delayed reactions in order to account for the time it takes for the entire process to be complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roussel MR, Zhu R |title=Validation of an algorithm for delay stochastic simulation of transcription and translation in prokaryotic gene expression |journal=Phys Biol |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=274–84 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17200603 |doi=10.1088/1478-3975/3/4/005 |url=http://stacks.iop.org/1478-3967/3/274|last2=Zhu |bibcode=2006PhBio...3..274R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From here, a set of reactions were proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ribeiro A, Zhu R, Kauffman SA |title=A general modeling strategy for gene regulatory networks with stochastic dynamics |journal=J. Comput. Biol. |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=1630–9 |date=November 2006 |pmid=17147485 |doi=10.1089/cmb.2006.13.1630|last2=Zhu |last3=Kauffman }}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow generating GRNs. These are then simulated using a modified version of the Gillespie algorithm, that can simulate multiple time delayed reactions (chemical reactions where each of the products is provided a time delay that determines when will it be released in the system as a "finished product").

For example, basic transcription of a gene can be represented by the following single-step reaction (RNAP is the RNA polymerase, RBS is the RNA ribosome binding site, and Pro&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the promoter region of gene ''i''):

: &lt;math&gt; \text{RNAP} + \text{Pro}_i \overset{k_{i,bas}}

\longrightarrow \text{Pro}_i(\tau _i^1 ) + \text{RBS}_i(\tau_i^1)+ \text{RNAP}(\tau _i^2) &lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, there seems to be a trade-off between the noise in gene expression, the speed with which genes can switch, and the metabolic cost associated their functioning. More specifically, for any given level of metabolic cost, there is an optimal trade-off between noise and processing speed and increasing the metabolic cost leads to better speed-noise trade-offs.&lt;ref name="a30"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsif.2009.0474 |author=Zabet NR, Chu DF |title=Computational limits to binary genes |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume=7 |issue=47 |pages=945–954 |date=June 2010 |pmid= 20007173 |url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/7/47/945.full |pmc=2871807|last2=Chu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a31"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biosystems.2011.01.006 |author=Chu DF, Zabet NR, Hone ANW |title=Optimal Parameter Settings for Information Processing in Gene Regulatory Networks |journal=BioSystems |volume=104 |issue=2–3 |pages=99–108 |date=May–Jun 2011 |pmid=21256918 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030326471100027X|last2=Zabet |last3=Hone }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a32"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.06.021 |author=Zabet NR |title=Negative feedback and physical limits of genes |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume= 284|issue=1 |pages=82–91 |date=September 2011 |pmid=21723295 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519311003201|arxiv=1408.1869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent work proposed a simulator (SGNSim, ''Stochastic Gene Networks Simulator''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ribeiro AS, Lloyd-Price J |title=SGN Sim, a stochastic genetic networks simulator |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=777–9 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17267430 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btm004 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17267430|last2=Lloyd-Price }}

&lt;/ref&gt; that can model GRNs where transcription and translation are modeled as multiple time delayed events and its dynamics is driven by a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) able to deal with multiple time delayed events.
The time delays can be drawn from several distributions and the reaction rates from complex
functions or from physical parameters. SGNSim can generate ensembles of GRNs within a set of user-defined parameters, such as topology. It can also be used to model specific GRNs and systems of chemical reactions. Genetic perturbations such as gene deletions, gene over-expression, insertions, frame shift mutations can also be modeled as well.

The GRN is created from a graph with the desired topology, imposing in-degree and out-degree distributions. Gene promoter activities are affected by other genes expression products that act as inputs, in the form of monomers or combined into multimers and set as direct or indirect. Next, each direct input is assigned to an operator site and different transcription factors can be allowed, or not, to compete for the same operator site, while indirect inputs are given a target. Finally, a function is assigned to each gene, defining the gene's response to a combination of transcription factors (promoter state). The transfer functions (that is, how genes respond to a combination of inputs) can be assigned to each combination of promoter states as desired.

In other recent work, multiscale models of gene regulatory networks have been developed that focus on synthetic biology applications. Simulations have been used that model all biomolecular interactions in transcription, translation, regulation, and induction of gene regulatory networks, guiding the design of synthetic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kaznessis YN |title=Models for synthetic biology |journal=BMC Syst Biol |volume=1|pages=47 |year=2007 |pmid=17986347 |pmc=2194732 |doi=10.1186/1752-0509-1-47 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/1/47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prediction ==

Other work has focused on predicting the gene expression levels in a gene regulatory network. The approaches used to model gene regulatory networks have been constrained to be interpretable and, as a result, are generally simplified versions of the network. For example, Boolean networks have been used due to their simplicity and ability to handle noisy data but lose data information by having a binary representation of the genes. Also, artificial neural networks omit using a hidden layer so that they can be interpreted, losing the ability to model higher order correlations in the data. Using a model that is not constrained to be interpretable, a more accurate model can be produced. Being able to predict gene expressions more accurately provides a way to explore how drugs affect a system of genes as well as for finding which genes are interrelated in a process. This has been encouraged by the DREAM competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The DREAM Project |publisher=Columbia University Center for Multiscale Analysis Genomic and Cellular Networks (MAGNet)  |url= http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/dream/index.php/The_DREAM_Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; which promotes a competition for the best prediction algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gustafsson M, Hörnquist M |title=Gene Expression Prediction by Soft Integration and the Elastic Net—Best Performance of the DREAM3 Gene Expression Challenge |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages= e9134|year=2010 |pmid= 20169069|pmc= 2821917|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0009134 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0009134|last2=Hörnquist |bibcode=2010PLoSO...5.9134G}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other recent work has used artificial neural networks with a hidden layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |vauthors=Smith MR, Clement M, Martinez T, Snell Q |title=Time Series Gene Expression Prediction using Neural Networks with Hidden Layers |booktitle=Proceedings of the 7th Biotechnology and Bioinformatics Symposium (BIOT 2010) |pages=67–69 |year=2010 |location= |url=http://axon.cs.byu.edu/papers/smith_2010biot.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

===Hypergraphia===
[[Hypergraphia]] is the tendency for extensive and compulsive writing or drawing, and has been observed in persons with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] who have experienced multiple seizures.&lt;ref name=Hypergraphia_repeated_seizures&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Tremont |first1 = Geoffrey |last2 = Smith |first2 = Megan M |last3 = Bauer |first3 = Lyndsey |last4 = Alosco |first4 = Michael L |last5 = Davis |first5 = Jennifer D |last6 = Blum |first6 = Andrew S |last7 = LaFrance |first7 = W Curt |title = Comparison of personality characteristics on the Bear-Fedio Inventory between patients with epilepsy and those with non-epileptic seizures. |journal = The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11020039 |pages=47–52 |issue = 1 |volume = 24 |year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with hypergraphia display extreme attention to detail in their writing.

'''High-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions''' are regions of the ocean where the abundance of [[phytoplankton]] is low and fairly constant despite the availability of [[Macronutrient (ecology)|macronutrients]]. Phytoplankton rely on a suite of nutrients for cellular function. Macronutrients (e.g., [[nitrate]], [[phosphate]], [[silicic acid]]) are generally available in higher quantities in surface ocean waters, and are the typical components of common garden fertilizers. [[Micronutrient]]s (e.g., [[iron]], [[zinc]], [[cobalt]]) are generally available in lower quantities and include [[trace metal]]s. Macronutrients are typically available in [[Molar concentration|millimolar concentrations,]] while micronutrients are generally available in micro- to nanomolar concentrations. In general, nitrogen tends to be a [[Limiting factor|limiting ocean nutrient]], but in HNLC regions it is never significantly depleted.&lt;ref name="lalli2"&gt;Lalli, C.M.;  Parsons, T.R.

Between the 1930s and '80s, it was hypothesized that iron is a limiting ocean micronutrient, but there were not sufficient methods to reliably detect iron in seawater to confirm this hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Primary productivity and biogeochemical cycles in the sea|last=Martin|first=John|publisher=Springer US|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=122–137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, high concentrations of iron-rich sediments in nearshore coastal waters off the Gulf of Alaska were detected.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=John|last2=Gordon|first2=Michael|last3=Fitzwater|first3=Steve|last4=Broenkow|first4=William W.|date=1989|title=VERTEX: phytoplankton/iron studies in the Gulf of Alaska|url=|journal=Deep Sea Research Part A. Oceanographic Research Papers|volume=35 | issue = 6 |pages=649–680|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, offshore waters had lower iron concentrations and lower productivity despite macronutrient availability for phytoplankton growth.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; This pattern was observed in other oceanic regions and led to the naming of three major HNLC zones: the North [[Pacific Ocean]], the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, and the [[Southern Ocean]].&lt;ref name="lalli2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pitchford3"/&gt;

The discovery of HNLC regions has fostered scientific debate about the ethics and efficacy of iron fertilization experiments which attempt to draw down atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] by stimulating surface-level photosynthesis. It has also led to the development of hypotheses such as grazing control which poses that HNLC regions are formed, in part, from the grazing of phytoplankton (e.g. [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[ciliate]]s) by smaller organisms (e.g. [[protist]]s).

Primary production is the process by which [[autotroph]]s use light to convert carbon from aqueous carbon dioxide to sugar for cellular growth.&lt;ref name=":272"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Biological oceanography|last=Miller|first=Charles B.|last2=Wheeler|first2=Patricia A.|publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.|year=2012|isbn=9781444333015|edition=2nd|location=Chichester, West Sussex|pages=49–62|oclc=794619582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light catalyzes the [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] process and nutrients are incorporated into [[Organic matter|organic material]]. For photosynthesis to occur, macronutrients such as nitrate and phosphate must be available in sufficient ratios and [[Bioavailability|bioavailable forms]] for biological utilization. The molecular ratio of 106(Carbon):16(Nitrogen):1(Phosphorus) was discovered by [[Redfield ratio|Redfield, Ketcham, and Richards (RKR)]] and is known as the [[Redfield ratio|Redfield Ratio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sea|last=Redfield|first=A.C.|last2=Ketchum|first2=G.H.|last3=Richards|first3=F.A.|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=1963|isbn=|editor-last=Hill|editor-first=M.N.|location=New York|pages=26–77|chapter=The influence of organisms on the composition of sea water}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photosynthesis (forward) and respiration (reverse) is represented by the equation:

:&lt;chem&gt;{106CO2} + {16HNO3} + {H3PO4} + {122H2O} &lt;=&gt; {(CH2O)106(NH3)16(H3PO4)} + {136O2}&lt;/chem&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aquatic Chemistry : Chemical Equilibria and Rates in Natural Waters.|last=Werner.|first=Stumm,|date=2013|publisher=Wiley|others=Morgan, James J.|isbn=9780471673033|edition=3rd|location=Hoboken|oclc=863203908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photosynthesis can be limited by deficiencies of certain macronutrients. However, in the North Pacific, the Equatorial Pacific, and the Southern Ocean macronutrients are found in sufficient ratios, quantities and bioavailable forms to support greater levels of primary production than found. Macronutrient availability in HNLC regions in tandem with low [[Biomass (ecology)|standing stock]]s of phytoplankton suggests that some other biogeochemical process limits phytoplankton growth.&lt;ref name=":272"/&gt;

Since primary production and phytoplankton biomass cannot currently be measured over entire ocean basins, scientists use [[Chlorophyll a|chlorophyll α]] as a proxy for primary production. Modern satellite observations monitor and track global chlorophyll α abundances in the ocean via [[remote sensing]]. Higher chlorophyll concentrations generally indicate areas of enhanced primary production, and conversely lower chlorophyll levels indicate low primary production. This co-occurrence of low chlorophyll and high macronutrient availability is why these regions are deemed "high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll."

In addition to the macronutrients needed for organic matter synthesis, phytoplankton need micronutrients such as [[trace metal]]s for cellular functions.&lt;ref name=":272"/&gt; Micronutrient availability can constrain primary production because trace metals are sometimes limiting nutrients. Iron has been determined to be a primary limiting micronutrient in HNLC provinces.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; Recent studies have indicated that zinc and cobalt may be secondary and/or co-limiting micronutrients.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/250217285|title=Iron and zinc effects on silicic acid and nitrate uptake kinetics in three high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":262"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=M.

== Global distribution ==

=== Common characteristics ===
HNLC regions cover 20% of the world’s oceans and are characterized by varying physical, chemical, and biological patterns. These surface waters have annually varying, yet relatively abundant macronutrient concentrations compared to other oceanic provinces.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; While HNLC broadly describes the biogeochemical trends of these large ocean regions, all three zones experience seasonal phytoplankton blooms in response to global atmospheric patterns. On average, HNLC regions tend to be growth-limited by iron and variably, zinc.&lt;ref name=":262"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":232"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De La Rocha|first=Christina L.|last2=Hutchins|first2=David A.|last3=Brzezinski|first3=Mark A.|last4=Zhang|first4=Yaohong|date=2000|title=Effects of iron and zinc deficiency on elemental composition and silica production by diatoms|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=195|pages=71–79|doi=10.3354/meps195071|jstor=24855011|bibcode=2000MEPS..195...71D}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trace metal limitation leads to communities of smaller sized phytoplankton. Compared to more productive regions of the ocean, HNLC zones have higher ratios of silicic acid to nitrate because larger [[diatom]]s, that require silicic acid to make their opal silica shells, are less prevalent.&lt;ref name=":42"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":262" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":232"/&gt; Unlike the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific, the Equatorial Pacific experiences temporal silicate availability which leads to large seasonal diatom blooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugdale|first=Richard C.|last2=Wilkerson|first2=Frances P.|last3=Minas|first3=Hans J.|date=1995-05-01|title=The role of a silicate pump in driving new production|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/096706379500015X|journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers|volume=42|issue=5|pages=697–719|doi=10.1016/0967-0637(95)00015-X|bibcode=1995DSRI...42..697D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dugdale|first=Richard C.|last2=Wilkerson|first2=Frances P.|date=1998-01-15|title=Silicate regulation of new production in the equatorial Pacific upwelling|url=https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v391/n6664/full/391270a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=391|issue=6664|pages=270–273|doi=10.1038/34630|bibcode=1998Natur.391..270D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distribution of trace metals and relative abundance of macronutrients are reflected in the plankton community structure. For example, the selection of phytoplankton with a high surface area to volume ratio results in HNLC regions being dominated by nano- and picoplankton. This ratio allows for optimal utilization of available dissolved nutrients. Larger phytoplankton, such as diatoms, cannot energetically sustain themselves in these regions. Common picoplankton within these regions include genera such as [[prochlorococcus]] (not generally found in the North Pacific), [[synechococcus]], and various [[eukaryote]]s. Grazing protists likely control the abundance and distribution of these small phytoplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cullen|first=John J.|last2=Lewis|first2=Marlon R.|last3=Davis|first3=Curtiss O.|last4=Barber|first4=Richard T.|date=1992-01-15|title=Photosynthetic characteristics and estimated growth rates indicate grazing is the proximate control of primary production in the equatorial Pacific|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|language=en|volume=97|issue=C1|pages=639–654|doi=10.1029/91JC01320|issn=2156-2202|bibcode=1992JGR....97..639C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landry|first=M.

The discovery and naming of the first HNLC region, the North Pacific, was formalized in a seminal paper published in 1988.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; The study concluded that surface waters of the eastern North Pacific are generally dominated by picoplankton despite the relative abundance of macronutrients.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; In other words, larger phytoplankton, such as diatoms which thrive in nutrient-rich waters, were not found. Instead, the surface waters were replete with smaller pico- and nanoplankton.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; Based on laboratory nutrient experiments, iron was hypothesized to be a key limiting micronutrient.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

The Pacific Ocean is the largest and oldest body of water on Earth. The North Pacific is characterized by the general clockwise rotation of the [[North Pacific Gyre|North Pacific gyre]], which is driven by [[trade winds]]. Spatial variations in tradewinds result in cooler air temperatures in the western North Pacific and milder air temperatures in the eastern North Pacific (i.e., Subartic Pacific).&lt;ref name=":212"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002684.html|title=Wiley: Biological Oceanography, 2nd edition - Charles B.

Concentrations of iron however vary throughout the year. Ocean currents are driven by seasonal atmospheric patterns which transport iron from the [[Kuril–Kamchatka Trench|Kuril-Kamchatka]] margin into the western Subarctic Pacific.

===  Equatorial Pacific ===
The Equatorial Pacific is an oceanic province characterized by nearly year-round upwelling due to the [[Convergence zone|convergence]] of trade winds from the northeast and southeast at the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]]. The Equatorial Pacific spans nearly half of Earth’s circumference and plays a major role in global marine [[new production|new primary production]].&lt;ref&gt;Chavez, F P., and J R Toggweiler, 1995: '''Physical estimates of global new production: The upwelling contribution''' In ''Dahlem Workshop on Upwelling in the Ocean: Modern Processes and Ancient Records'', Chichester, UK, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 313-320.&lt;/ref&gt; New production is a term used in [[biological oceanography]] to describe the way in which nitrogen is recycled within the ocean.&lt;ref name=":212"/&gt; In regions of enhanced new production, [[nitrate]] from the [[aphotic zone]] makes its way into surface waters, replenishing surface nitrate supply. Despite nitrogen availability in Equatorial Pacific waters, primary production and observed surface ocean biomass is considerably lower compared to other major upwelling regions of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eppley|first=R. W.|last2=Renger|first2=E. H.|date=1992-01-15|title=Nitrate utilization by plankton in the equatorial Pacific March 1988 along 150°W|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans|language=en|volume=97|issue=C1|pages=663–668|doi=10.1029/91JC01271|issn=2156-2202|bibcode=1992JGR....97..663E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Equatorial Pacific is considered one of the three major HNLC regions.

Like other major HNLC provinces, the Equatorial Pacific is considered nutrient-limited due to lack of trace metals such as iron. The Equatorial Pacific receives approximately 7-10 times more iron from [[Cromwell current|Equatorial Undercurrent]] (EUC) upwelling than from inputs due to settling atmospheric dust.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winckler|first=Gisela|last2=Anderson|first2=Robert F.|last3=Jaccard|first3=Samuel L.|last4=Marcantonio|first4=Franco|date=2016-05-31|title=Ocean dynamics, not dust, have controlled equatorial Pacific productivity over the past 500,000 years|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/113/22/6119|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=113|issue=22|pages=6119–6124|doi=10.1073/pnas.1600616113|issn=0027-8424|pmid=27185933|pmc=4896667|bibcode=2016PNAS..113.6119W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate reconstructions of [[glacial periods]] using [[Proxy (climate)#lake and ocean sediments|sediment proxy records]] have revealed that the Equatorial Pacific may have been 2.5 times more productive than the modern equatorial ocean.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During these glacial periods the Equatorial Pacific increased its export of marine new production,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; thus providing a sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The science of [[paleoceanography]] attempts to understand the interplay of glacial cycles with ocean dynamics. Paleo-oceanographers currently challenge the Aeolian Dust hypothesis which suggests that the transport of atmospheric iron-rich off Central and South America controls the intensity of primary production in the Equatorial Pacific.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One study suggests that because EUC upwelling provides most of the bioavailable iron to the equatorial surface waters, the only method to reverse HNLC conditions is by enhancing upwelling.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Landry|first=Michael R.|last2=Selph|first2=Karen E.|last3=Taylor|first3=Andrew G.|last4=Décima|first4=Moira|last5=Balch|first5=William M.|last6=Bidigare|first6=Robert R.|date=2011-02-01|title=Phytoplankton growth, grazing and production balances in the HNLC equatorial Pacific|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064510002286|journal=Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography|series=Plankton Dynamics and Carbon Cycling in the Equatorial Pacific|volume=58|issue=3|pages=524–535|doi=10.1016/j.dsr2.2010.08.011|bibcode=2011DSRII..58..524L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In other words, enhanced regional upwelling, rather than iron-rich atmospheric dust deposition, may explain why this region experiences higher primary productivity during glacial periods.

Compared to the North Pacific and Southern Ocean, Equatorial Pacific waters have relatively low levels of [[biogenic silica]] and thus don't support significant standing stocks of diatoms&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Picoplankton are the most abundant marine primary producers in these regions due mainly to their ability to [[Assimilation (biology)|assimilate]] low concentrations of trace metals.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Various phytoplankton communities within the Equatorial Pacific are grazed at the same rate as their growth rate, which further limits primary production.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

There is no current consensus regarding which of the two main hypotheses (grazing or micronutrients) controls production in these equatorial waters. It is likely that trace metal limitations select for smaller-celled organisms, which thereby increases the grazing pressure of protists.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; While the Equatorial Pacific maintains HNLC characteristics, productivity can be high at times. Productivity leads to an abundance of seabirds such as [[storm petrel]]s near the convergence of subtropical water and the equatorial "cold tongue." The Equatorial Pacific contains the world's largest yellowfin tuna fisheries&lt;ref name=":212" /&gt; and is home to the [[spotted dolphin]].

== Hypotheses ==
Given the remote location of HNLC areas, scientists have combined modeling and observational data in order to study limits on primary production. Combining these two data sources allows for comparison between the North Pacific, Equatorial Pacific, and Southern Ocean. Two current explanations for global HNLC regions are growth limitations due to iron availability and phytoplankton grazing controls.

{{Main article|Dust}}Iron enters remote HNLC regions through two primary methods: upwelling of nutrient-rich water and atmospheric [[dust]] deposition. Iron needs to be replenished frequently and in bioavailable forms because of its [[Solubility|insolubility]], rapid uptake through biological systems, and binding affinity with [[ligand]]s.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mioni|first=Cécile E.|last2=Handy|first2=Sara M.|last3=Ellwood|first3=Michael J.|last4=Twiss|first4=Michael R.|last5=McKay|first5=R.

=== Grazing control hypothesis ===
Formulated by John Walsh in 1976, the grazing hypothesis states that grazing by [[heterotroph]]s suppresses primary productivity in areas of high nutrient concentrations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walsh|first=John J.|date=1976-01-01|title=Herbivory as a factor in patterns of nutrient utilization in the sea1|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|language=en|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–13|doi=10.4319/lo.1976.21.1.0001|issn=1939-5590|bibcode=1976LimOc..21....1W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predation by [[Zooplankton|microzooplankton]] primarily accounts for phytoplankton loss in HNLC regions. Grazing by larger [[zooplankton]] and advective mixing are also responsible for a small proportion of losses to phytoplankton communities.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frost|first=Bruce W.|date=1991|title=The role of grazing in nutrient-rich areas of the open sea|url=|journal=American Society of Limnology and Oceanography|volume=38|issue=8|pages=1616–1630|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minas|first=Hans Joachim|last2=Minas|first2=Monique|date=1992|title=Net community production in "High Nutrient-Low Chlorophyll" waters of the tropical and Antarctic Oceans: grazing vs iron hypothesis|url=|journal=Oceanologica Acta|volume=15|issue=2|pages=145–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constant grazing limits phytoplankton to a low, constant standing stock. Without this [[grazing pressure]], some scientists believe small phytoplankton would produce blooms despite micronutrient depletion because smaller phytoplankton typically have lower iron requirements and can absorb nutrients at a slower rate.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

=== Contemporary view ===
Current scientific consensus agrees that HNLC areas lack high productivity because of a combination of iron and physiological limitations, grazing pressure, and physical forcings.&lt;ref name="pitchford3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frost|first=B.W.|date=July 27, 1987|title=Grazing control of phytoplankton stock in the open subarctic Pacific Ocean: a model assessing the role of mesozooplankton, particularly the large calanoid copepods Neocalanus spp.|url=|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|volume=39|pages=49–68|via=|doi=10.3354/meps039049|bibcode=1987MEPS...39...49F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which each factor contributes to low production may differ in each HNLC region. Iron limitation allows for smaller, more iron-frugal phytoplankton to grow at rapid rates, while grazing by microzooplankton maintains stable stocks of these smaller phytoplankton.&lt;ref name=":132" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Once micronutrients become available, grazing may then limit bloom sizes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Additional micronutrient limitations from trace metals like zinc or cobalt may suppress phytoplankton blooms.&lt;ref name=":232"/&gt; Turbulent mixing at higher-latitude HNLC regions (North Pacific and Southern Ocean) may mix phytoplankton below the [[Critical Depth|critical depth]] needed to have community growth.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Geo-engineering HNLC regions ==

=== Theory ===
[[File:CO2_pump_hg.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CO2_pump_hg.svg|thumb|382x382px|The marine carbon cycle. Carbon dioxide is taken up by phytoplankton for photosynthesis and incorporated into the marine food web. When plankton or predator dies, sedimentation of organic matter reaches the seafloor, where carbon can be buried and sequestered. Stimulating phytoplankton blooms is thought to increase sedimentation of particulate organic carbon after the blooms die off, leading to increased carbon sequestration.]]
Since past iron fertilization experiments have resulted in large phytoplankton blooms, some have suggested that large-scale ocean fertilization experiments should be conducted to draw down inorganic anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the form of [[Total organic carbon|particulate organic carbon]]. Fertilization would stimulate biological productivity, leading to a decrease in the amount of inorganic surface carbon dioxide within a fertilized patch. The bloom would then die off and presumably sink to the deep ocean, taking much of the absorbed carbon dixoide to the seafloor and [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering]] it from the short-term [[carbon cycle]] in the deep ocean or ocean sediments.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Behrenfeld|first=Michael J.|last2=Bale|first2=Anthony J.|last3=Kolber|first3=Zbigniew S.|last4=Aiken|first4=James|last5=Falkowski|first5=Paul G.|date=October 1996|title=Confirmation of iron limitation of phytoplankton photosynthesis in the equatorial Pacific Ocean|url=|journal=Nature|volume=383|issue=6600|pages=508–511|via=|doi=10.1038/383508a0|bibcode=1996Natur.383..508B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeebe|first=R.

=== Efficiency and efficacy ===
To effectively remove anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere, iron fertilization would need to result in significant removal of particulate carbon from the surface ocean and transport it to the deep ocean.&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":102"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Various studies estimated that less than 7-10% of carbon taken up during a bloom would be sequestered,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=Philip W.|last2=Law|first2=Cliff S.|last3=Wong|first3=C.S.|last4=Nojiri|first4=Yukihiro|last5=Tsuda|first5=Atsushi|last6=Levasseur|first6=Maurice|last7=Takeda|first7=Shigenobu|last8=Rivkin|first8=Richard|last9=Harrison|first9=Paul J.|date=2004-03-17|title=The decline and fate of an iron-induced subarctic phytoplankton bloom|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=428|issue=6982|pages=549–553|doi=10.1038/nature02437|pmid=15058302|issn=1476-4687|bibcode=2004Natur.428..549B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and only a 15-25 [[Parts-per notation|ppm]] decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide would result with sustained global iron fertilization.&lt;ref name=":272"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The amount of carbon dioxide removed may be offset by the fuel cost of acquiring, transporting, and releasing significant amounts of iron into remote HNLC regions.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Many environmental concerns exist for large-scale iron fertilization. While blooms can be studied and traced, scientists still do not know if the extra production gets incorporated into the food chain or falls to the deep ocean after a bloom dies off.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":102" /&gt; Even if carbon is exported to depth, raining organic matter can be respired, potentially creating mid-column [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] zones or causing [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] of deep ocean water.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cao|first=Long|last2=Caldeira|first2=Ken|date=2010-03-01|title=Can ocean iron fertilization mitigate ocean acidification?|journal=Climatic Change|language=en|volume=99|issue=1–2|pages=303–311|doi=10.1007/s10584-010-9799-4|issn=0165-0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pronounced community shifts to diatoms have been observed during fertilization, and it’s still unclear if the change in species composition has any long-term environmental effects.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

The '''International Association for the Cognitive Science of Religion''' ('''IACSR'''), founded in 2006, is a scholarly association dedicated to the promotion of the [[Cognitive Science of Religion]]. The IACSR is an interdisciplinary association, including scholars from a wide variety of disciplines in the human, social, natural and health sciences that are interested in the academic, scientific study of religious phenomena. The IACSR seeks to advance the naturalistic study of religion. It is strictly scientific and does not encourage or welcome those who are interested in dialogue between science and religion, attempt to find religion in science and science in religion, or attempt to validate religious or spiritual doctrines through cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;[[IACSR]] as cited in {{cite web |url=http://www.iacsr.com/Home.html |title=IACSR-Home |accessdate=2008-08-08 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Jacobi ellipsoid''' is a [[triaxial ellipsoid|triaxial (i.e. scalene) ellipsoid]] under equilibrium which arises when a self-gravitating fluid body of uniform density rotates with a constant angular velocity. It is named after the [[Germans|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi, C. G. (1834). Ueber die figur des gleichgewichts. Annalen der Physik, 109(8–16), 229–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1969). Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium (Vol. 10, p. 253). New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1967). Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium—an historical account. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 20(2), 251–265.&lt;/ref&gt;==
Before Jacobi, the [[Maclaurin spheroid]] which was formulated in 1742, was considered to be the only type of [[ellipsoid]] which can be in equilibrium. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] in 1811&lt;ref&gt;Lagrange, J. L. (1811). Mécanique Analytique sect. IV 2 vol.&lt;/ref&gt; considered the possibility of a tri-axial ellipsoid being in equilibrium, but concluded that the two equatorial axes of the [[ellipsoid]] must be equal, leading back to the solution of [[Maclaurin spheroid]]. But [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]] realized that [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]'s demonstration is a sufficiency condition, but not necessary. He remarked, "One would make a grave mistake if one supposed that the spheroids of revolution are the only admissible figures of equilibrium even under the restrictive assumption of second degree surfaces" and further adds that "In fact a simple consideration shows that ellipsoids with three unequal axes can very well be figures of equilibrium; and that one can assume an ellipse of arbitrary shape for the equatorial section and determine the third axis (which is also the least of the three axes) and the angular velocity of rotation such that the ellipsoid is a figure of equilibrium."&lt;ref&gt;Dirichlet, G. L. (1856). Gedächtnisrede auf Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 52, 193–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jacobi formula==
[[File:Jacobi-ellipsoid-dimensions-2.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|The equatorial (''a'', ''b'') and polar (''c'') semi-principal axes of a Jacobi ellipsoid and Maclaurin spheroid, as a function of normalized angular momentum, subject to ''abc''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (i.e. for constant volume of 4π/3).&lt;br/&gt;The broken lines are for the Maclaurin spheroid in the range where it has dynamic but not secular stability - it will relax into the Jacobi ellipsoid provided it can dissipate energy by virtue of a viscous constituent fluid.]]

For an ellipsoid with semi-principal axes &lt;math&gt;a, \ b, \ c&lt;/math&gt;, the angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^2}{\pi G\rho} = 2 abc \int_0^\infty \frac{udu}{(a^2+u)(b^2+u)\Delta}\ , \quad \Delta^2 = (a^2+u)(b^2+u)(c^2+u)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]], subject to the condition

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 b^2 \int_0^\infty \frac{du}{(a^2+u)(b^2+u)\Delta} = c^2\int_0^\infty \frac{du}{(c^2+u)\Delta}&lt;/math&gt;

For fixed values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, the above condition has solution for &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c^2}&gt;\frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The integrals can be expressed in terms of [[Elliptic integral|incomplete elliptic integral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, G. H. (1886). On Jacobi's figure of equilibrium for a rotating mass of fluid. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 41(246–250), 319–336.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the [[Carlson symmetric form]] elliptic integral &lt;math&gt;R_{J}&lt;/math&gt;, the formula for the angular velocity becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^{2}}{\pi G \rho} = \frac{4 a b c}{3 (a^{2} - b^{2})} (a^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},a^{2}) - b^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},b^{2}))&lt;/math&gt;

and the condition on the relative size of the semi-principal axes &lt;math&gt;a, \ b, \ c&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} \frac{a^{2} b^{2}}{b^{2} - a^{2}} (R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},a^{2}) - R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},b^{2})) = \frac{2}{3} c^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},c^{2})&lt;/math&gt;

The angular momentum &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of the Jacobi ellipsoid is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{\sqrt{GM^3\bar{a}}} = \frac{\sqrt 3}{10}\frac{a^2+b^2}{\bar{a}^2}\sqrt{\frac{\Omega^2}{\pi G\rho}} \ , \quad \bar{a}=(abc)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the ellipsoid and &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''mean radius'', the radius of a sphere of the same volume as the ellipsoid.

==Relationship with Dedekind ellipsoid==

The Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids are both equilibrium figures for a body of rotating homogeneous self-gravitating fluid. However, while the Jacobi ellipsoid spins bodily, with no internal flow of the fluid in the rotating frame, the Dedekind ellipsoid maintains a fixed orientation, with the constituent fluid circulating within it. This is a direct consequence of [[Dirichlet's ellipsoidal problem#Dedekind's theorem|Dedekind's theorem]].

For any given Jacobi ellipsoid, there exists a Dedekind ellipsoid with the same semi-principal axes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and same mass and with a [[flow velocity|flow velocity field]] of&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar1965"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = \zeta \frac{- a^{2} y \mathbf{\hat{x}} + b^{2} x \mathbf{\hat{y}}}{a^{2} + b^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vorticity]], which is uniform throughout the spheroid (&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times \mathbf{u} = \zeta \mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt;). The angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of the Jacobi ellipsoid and vorticity of the corresponding Dedekind ellipsoid are related by&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar1965"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \left( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a}\right) \Omega&lt;/math&gt;

That is, each particle of the fluid of the Dedekind ellipsoid describes a [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] elliptical circuit in the same period in which the Jacobi spheroid performs one rotation.

In the special case of &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;, the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids (and the Maclaurin spheroid) become one and the same; bodily rotation and circular flow amount to the same thing. In this case &lt;math&gt;\zeta = 2 \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, as is always true for a rigidly rotating body.

In the general case, the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids have the same energy&lt;ref name="Bardeen"/&gt;, but the angular momentum of the Jacobi spheroid is the greater by a factor of&lt;ref name="Bardeen"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L_{\mathrm{Jac}}}{L_{\mathrm{Ded}}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The '''''Journal of Biblical Literature''''' ('''''JBL''''') is one of three [[academic journals]] published by the [[Society of Biblical Literature]] (SBL).
First published in 1881, ''JBL'' is the flagship journal of the field. ''JBL'' is published quarterly and includes scholarly articles, critical notes, and book reviews by members of the Society. 
''JBL'' is available on line as well as in print:

''JBL'' has a moving window of Open Access. Aside from the current issue, the past three years of ''JBL'' are freely available to the public in PDF form, after registering on the SBL website. Previous issues, back to 1881, are available in the JSTOR Arts and Sciences III collection."&lt;ref&gt;Carl Kinbar, [http://sblonline.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=580 'Open Access and the SBL',] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014152635/http://www.sblonline.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=580 |date=2006-10-14 }} ''[[SBL Forum]]'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The journal was originally published under the title ''Journal of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis''. The current name was adopted with volume 9 (1890).

At the fourth meeting, on 29 December 1881, the SBL council voted to print 500 copies of a journal, including the full text of papers read at the society's annual June meetings.&lt;ref&gt;
''JBL'' '''50''' (1931): xxiv-xlix.&lt;/ref&gt;

''JBL'' was, at first, an annual serial, from 1882 to 1905 (though two serials appeared in each of 1886 and 1887). ''JBL'' became semiannual from 1906 to 1911, and has been quarterly since 1912 (with a hiatus in 1915 and exceptional years with only two serials).&lt;ref name="Scriptures" /&gt;

In 1916, the SBL secretary passed on to the members a communication, from the Third Assistant Postmaster General of the United States, refusing to give the ''JBL'' the second-class rate discount for scholarly journals, "on the ground that it was not scientific."&lt;ref name=Scriptures&gt;Saunders, Ernest W., 'Journal', in chapter 8, [http://www.sbl-site.org/SSchapter8.aspx 'Of the Making of Books'], of ''Searching the Scriptures: A History of the Society of Biblical Literature, 1880-1980'', (Chico: Scholars' Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Journal of the Society for Biblical Literature in the United States was published in Leipzig through World War I down to the Nazi period—yet for the most part this feature showed up only when it became a problem for delivery after Germany began to be devastated after 1916."&lt;ref&gt;
Martin E. Marty, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3260316 Review of ''Searching the Scriptures'',] ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''103''' (1984): 85-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Sharpe (scholar)|Samuel Sharpe]], an English [[Minister (Christianity)|ordained minister]] and [[Egyptology|egyptologist]] was editor of a journal also called ''Journal of Bibilical Literature'', published from London prior to the establishment of SBL and its journal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6268">[[File:BabbageKeyValueCard.tiff|thumb|350px|A tabular data card proposed for Babbage's [[Analytical Engine]] showing a key–value pair, in this instance a number and its base-ten logarithm.]]
A '''key-value database''', or '''key-value store''', is a data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing [[associative array]]s, a [[data structure]] more commonly known today as a ''dictionary'' or ''[[hash table]]''. Dictionaries contain a [[Collection (abstract data type)|collection]] of ''[[Object (computer science)|objects]]'', or ''[[Record (computer science)|records]]'', which in turn have many different ''[[Field (computer science)|fields]]'' within them, each containing data. These records are stored and retrieved using a ''key'' that uniquely identifies the record, and is used to quickly find the data within the [[database]]. 
[[File:KeyValue.PNG|thumb|300x300px]]
Key-value databases work in a very different fashion from the better known [[relational database]]s (RDB). RDBs pre-define the data structure in the database as a series of tables containing fields with well defined [[data type]]s. Exposing the data types to the database program allows it to apply a number of optimizations. In contrast, key-value systems treat the data as a single opaque collection, which may have different fields for every record. This offers considerable flexibility and more closely follows modern concepts like [[object-oriented programming]]. Because optional values are not represented by placeholders or input parameters, as in most RDBs, key-value databases often use far less [[computer memory|memory]] to store the same database, which can lead to large performance gains in certain workloads.{{fact|date=October 2017}}

Performance, a lack of standardization and other issues limited key-value systems to niche uses for many years, but the rapid move to [[cloud computing]] after 2010 has led to a renaissance as part of the broader [[NoSQL]] movement. Some [[graph database]]s are also key-value databases internally, adding the concept of the relationships (''[[Pointer (computer programming)|pointers]]'') between records as a first class data type.

==Types and notable examples==
Key-value databases can use [[consistency model]]s ranging from [[eventual consistency]] to [[serializability]]. Some support ordering of keys. Some maintain data [[In-memory_database|in memory (RAM)]], while others employ [[solid-state drive]]s or [[hard disk drive|rotating disks]].

[[Redis]] was the most popular implementation of a key-value database as of August 2015, according to [[DB-Engines ranking]].&lt;ref&gt;http://db-engines.com/en/ranking&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of key-value database is [[Oracle NoSQL Database]]. Oracle NoSQL Database provides a key-value paradigm to the application developer. Every entity (record) is a set of key-value pairs. A key has multiple components, specified as an ordered list. The major key identifies the entity and consists of the leading components of the key. The subsequent components are called minor keys. This organization is similar to a directory path specification in a file system (e.g., /Major/minor1/minor2/). The “value” part of the key-value pair is simply an uninterpreted string of bytes of arbitrary length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbjournal.ro/archive/12/12.pdf  "Oracle NoSQL Database"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unix system provides [[dbm]] (database manager) which is a library originally written by [[Ken Thompson]]. Also ported to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] OS platforms, provided through programming languages such as [[Perl#Windows|Perl for Win32]]. The dbm manages associative arrays of arbitrary data by use of a single key (a primary key). Modern implementations include [[sdbm]] and [[GNU dbm]].

'''Learning society''' is an educational philosophy advocated by the [[OECD]]&lt;ref&gt;OECD. (2000). “Knowledge Management in the Learning Society”. Paris: OECD Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UNESCO]] that positions education as the key to a nation’s economic development, and holds that education should extend beyond [[formal learning]] (based in traditional educational institutions – schools, universities etc.) into [[informal learning]] centres to support a [[knowledge economy]] (known as a “world education culture”).&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"&gt;Spring, J. (2009). “Globalization of Education: An Introduction”. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A learning society regards the actual process of learning as an ‘activity, not a place’&lt;ref name="cisco.com"&gt;Cisco Systems Inc. (2010). “The Learning Society”. Retrieved September 14, 2010, from Cisco Systems Inc.: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/citizenship/socio-economic/docs/LearningSociety_WhitePaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, it takes place outside of regular educational institutions, and is thus also decentralised and deregulated, a tenet of globalisation theory.

Learning societies are broader in context, drawing on elements of systems to facilitate the ability for [[lifelong learning]] in the individual. If lifelong learning is about the ability of the individual, then this is enabled through a Learning Society.

It is the ‘socialisation’ &lt;ref name="learndev.org"&gt;McClellan, J. (n.d.). “Envisioning Learning Societies Across Multiple Dimensions.” Retrieved September 13, 2010, from Learning Development Institute: http://www.learndev.org/dl/VS3-00g-LearnSocMultDim.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; of individual lifelong learning, and is currently aided through technologies and the increasing focus on social networking, by using the shared learning experiences of individuals as a basis for a larger network of education that exists formally and informally (schools, universities, job-training, support, collaboration, feedback etc.).

== History and theoretical framework ==
The history of the concept of the learning society can be traced through the chronological development of its theoretical framework. As the framework has developed overtime, so has the sophistication of the idea of the learning society as it applies to an inter-connected 21st-century model, particularly in relation to the shift from state-based educational institutions to more decentralised organisations.

In 1973, [[Donald Schön]]&lt;ref&gt;Schön, D. A. (1973). “Beyond the Stable State. Public and private learning in a changing society.” Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the idea that change is constant in a modern state (‘loss of the stable state’) and thus to adapt to this change, there must be a constant state of learning within the society of that state.
Further, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]]&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, R. M. (1970). “The Learning Society”. Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; also argued that given the ever-changing nature of states, particularly in business organisations, it wasn’t possible for educational institutions to keep up, or even be expected to. 
Later, Torsten Husén&lt;ref&gt;Husén, T. (1986). “The Learning Society Revisited.” Oxford: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stewart Ranson&lt;ref&gt;Ranson, S. (1998). “Inside the Learning Society.” London: Cassell.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasise that learning has a certain ‘fluidity’ (with no start or end points) that exists outside of formal systems and this seems to reflect a liberalised market model of free movements of knowledge as required by organisations and systems.&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt;

Developing this framework to a more contemporary basis, it is seen that the requirement for a ‘learning society’ is a response to the broader issues of globalisation whereby richer countries have then become increasingly dependent on “knowledge workers” rather than traditional manufacturing industries (now often outsourced to developing nations), and thus need their workforces to become adaptable, particularly in light of new technological developments which are seen as central to the knowledge economy.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"&gt;Jarvis, P. (2000). “Globalisation, the learning society and comparative education.” Comparative Education , 36 (3), 343-355.&lt;/ref&gt;
With this model the concept of the learning society will be transplanted to other countries globally, much like any other product on a global market. This is in keeping with the philosophy of the World Bank that learning and education is central to improved development, justice, the environment and eradication of poverty (and thus global terror threats).&lt;ref name="learndev.org"/&gt;

== Relationship to lifelong learning ==
A learning society is generally considered to be the basis from which lifelong learning can take place.
From a theoretical standpoint, not only does the learning society provide the framework in which lifelong learning is allowed to flourish, but that in fact both elements mutually support each other. That is, a learning society gives rise to the capacity for lifelong learning, but lifelong learning allows, through socialisation, for individuals to contribute back to the learning abilities of broader society in the form of wisdom (known as a ‘koinosophic’ or ‘wise’ society).&lt;ref name="learndev.org"/&gt;

== Elements of learning societies ==
While the notion of the learning society can be sometimes difficult to grasp (relying as it does on concepts such as ‘fluidity’ and ‘informality’, and moving outside of traditional educative boundaries such as schools &amp; universities), some scholars believe that a learning society can be identified as having 4 main attributes.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt; These are:

=== Futuristic ===
This is described as the tendency of the learning society to have a dependency on technological advances. This can be regarded as the shifts towards knowledge economies in developed countries where the concept of the learning society is most prevalent, but also vitally as acknowledging the importance of the internet in allowing education to move beyond traditional boundaries and move across transnational borders instantly.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;

=== Societal ===
This attribute is part of the broader conscious acknowledgement that is made by states and institutions that lifelong learning (as part of the learning society) exists specifically to contribute to the economic growth of a country and increase the democratic engagement of its citizens. Rather than being a general global shift towards an educational trend, it is aims towards specific outcomes that societies consider to be for their betterment.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;

=== Reflexive ===
This attribute requires learning societies to recognise not just the role of lifelong learning within the broader community, but also to enable it to be adaptable to changes, and flexible to specific individual needs. These changes may come about as a result of technological advances, legislative amendments or personal preferences of the individual undertaking the education. According to Jarvis:
(italics)(indent) “...education will be but one more provider of information in the learning market and the educational qualification will become the public recognition of a private process.” &lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;
(normal)(no indent) Thus, it will be the awareness of an individual’s ability to learn that will be of value, rather than what that individual has learned in the past.

=== Global market ===
The final attribute of a learning society requires that, like many products on a global market, education becomes a commodity and that students or participants in the learning process become consumers, able to pick and choose the types of education that they would like, to suit their own personal preferences. This would be facilitated through technological advances that allow students to access learning resources (and qualifications) globally. Under this attribute, education would then become tailored towards providing “customer satisfaction” to become economically justifiable.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;

== Current models of learning societies today ==

=== Australia and UK ===
One of the most prevalent examples is the model of the [[Open University|Open Universities]], common in the UK and Australia. They allow students to work towards qualifications accredited by existing higher educational institutions but ‘cherry-pick’ the courses they have a preference for, while at the same time conducting their learning online.
This is best typified by a testimonial found on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100919132046/http://www.open.edu.au/public/home Open Universities Australia] website:
:''“Studying through OUA is very rewarding, particularly if you are a motivated and patient person. It also offers the flexibility that you simply can’t get with a brick-and-mortar university, which is definitely beneficial for some."'' – Open Universities Australia testimonial&lt;ref&gt;Open Universities Australia. (2010, September 10). “Future Students - Open Universities Australia.” Retrieved September 10, 2010, from Open Universities Australia: {{cite web |url=http://www.open.edu.au/public/future-students |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908063554/http://www.open.edu.au/public/future-students |archivedate=2010-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In 1993, China aimed by the year 2000 to increase to 4% of GDP its spending on education in an effort to move the Chinese population towards being a learning society. It did not meet this target, but in 2009 resolved to meet the same goal by 2020 (which would total some US$200 billion in investment). This proposed investment would address reforms such as:&lt;ref name="chinaeducationblog.com"&gt;Quosdorf, F. (2010, June 14). "China defines road map for becoming a learning society by 2020." Retrieved October 1, 2010, from The China Education Blog: {{cite web |url=http://www.chinaeducationblog.com/education-reform-chinese-education-policy/2010-06-14/china-defines-road-map-for-becoming-a-learning-society-by-2020/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001082619/http://www.chinaeducationblog.com/education-reform-chinese-education-policy/2010-06-14/china-defines-road-map-for-becoming-a-learning-society-by-2020/ |archivedate=2010-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increase private-public sector partnerships in pre-schools
* Increase global stature of universities and higher education institutions
* Improve education standards in rural areas
* Develop non-formal education facilities to allow for lifelong learning (i.e. distance learning, network building)
* Reform of nationwide examination programs
* Digitise learning processes through technology

=== United States ===
On the United States Department of Education website &lt;ref&gt;"United States Department of Education". Retrieved October 1, 2010, from the United States Department of Education: http://www.ed.gov&lt;/ref&gt; there is very little reference to the concept of the learning society. What does exist consists of Taiwan's EduCity of networked schools and classrooms in the National Education Technology Plan 2010&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;United States Department of Education. (2010, May 14). "Support for a learning society." Retrieved October 1, 2010, from United States Department of Education: http://www.ed.gov/technology/netp-2010/support-learning-society-sb&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
The concept of lifelong learning (as facilitated by a learning society) would allow for higher education to be undertaken at any stage of the students life (perhaps even on more than one occasion) rather than at the traditional undergraduate stage.

Based very much in the “world education culture” model”,&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt; learning societies are seen as being central to competitive knowledge economy in a globalised world.
Advocates of learning societies see traditional institutions as no longer being central to lifelong learning. For example, transnational corporations such as Cisco believe that it will not come about simply through building more schools and universities. These organisations also advocate for the role of lifelong learning within their own structures.&lt;ref name="cisco.com"/&gt;

== Debates regarding learning societies &amp; higher education ==
Debates are argued addressing the role of how existing higher education institutions fit into the concept of the learning society. Despite the traditional argument that the learning society eschews traditional institutions, some advocates of the concept reaffirm the role of universities as being central to where the learning society begins and argue that “the university’s role in society is precisely to learn and understand itself and its environment...The more it addresses the concerns of society in its research, and the more it widens access to all members of society to benefit from the fruits of the research, the more it supports a genuine ‘learning society’” &lt;ref&gt;Laurillard, D. (1999). “A Conversational Framework for Individual Learning Applied to the 'Learning Organisation' and the 'Learning Society'”. Systems Research &amp; Behavioural Science , 16 (2), 113-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, newly elected [[australians|Australian]] [[prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Julia Gillard]] reflected the growing diversification of the education sector in her cabinet, by abandoning the role of a traditional ‘Education Minister’ and instead subsuming the role of higher education into a ministerial portfolio that also included jobs, skills and workplace relations – this move was criticised by many high-profile universities in Australia who argued that it undermined the central role of higher education as a place for learning in society.&lt;ref&gt;Tomazin, F. (2010, September 13). “Unis hit Gillard cabinet changes.” The Age , pp. http://www.theage.com.au/federal-election/unis-hit-gillard-cabinet-changes-20100912-15703.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, advocates of the ‘Learning Society’ also call upon partnerships between public and private enterprises to expand the scope of education to allow for more powerful educational learning experiences inside and outside of traditional institutions. These partnerships are seen to increase supplement funding levels (where inadequate public funds exists) as well as open traditional institutions and methods to technology and industry”.&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt;

One criticism is that the learning society does not actually exist, but is simply a tool or theory invoked by powers (governments, IGO’s) to push certain agendas. This argument maintains that it is easy to see how the idea could be used to justify World Bank &amp; OECD programs in developing countries &lt;ref&gt;Hughes, C., &amp; Tight, M. (1995). “The Myth of the Learning Society”. British Journal of Education Studies , 43 (3), 290-304.&lt;/ref&gt; Or rather that it is nothing more than a vague term to describe an unfocused notion of 'learning on the internet'&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt;

It is often difficult to find, despite the prevalence of the term ‘learning society’ amongst policy makers and politicians, information of real strategic funding from governments or corporations that reflect the theories and approaches of the learning society.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Sackett, P. D. (2010, March 18). Preparing A Learning Society For The Future. Retrieved October 2, 2010, from Chief Scientist for Australia: http://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/100318-CSMR-PMSEIC-final-Media-Release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to questions being asked of the concept of the learning society, beyond ‘on-the-job’ training corporations may speak of the value of learning, but could it simply be another term for ‘flexibility’ on the part of employees? Is the term simply a term used to define current (yet inevitable) changes in education technology in an increasingly connected world? In the case of China's proposed improvements to their education system,&lt;ref name="chinaeducationblog.com"/&gt; it could be argued that much of the reforms are simply a timeline of general educational upgrades, rather than adhering to any particular philosophy unique to a 'learning society'.

Further, a lack of specificity can exist in much of the literature surrounding the learning society. For example, the Cisco white paper speaks of:
:''"...21st Century skills like collaboration, problem-solving and creativity..."''&lt;ref name="cisco.com"/&gt;
but how these particular skills are unique to the idea of a learning society (as opposed to learning generally) is not clear.

Further, there is criticism that standardisation of assessment and credentialing ignores the cultural differences between global communities, and thus erodes important distinctions that may allow learning and education to be effectively embedded in those cultures”.&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt;

The '''Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry''' ('''[[Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer]] Institute''') in [[Göttingen]] is a research institute of the [[Max Planck Society]]. Currently, 850 people work at the institute, about half of them are scientists.

The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry is the only one of the institutes within the Max Planck Society which combines the three classical scientific disciplines – [[biology]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]]. Founded in 1971, its initial focus was set on physical and chemical problems. It has since undergone a continuous evolution manifested by an expanding range of core subjects and work areas such as [[neurobiology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]].

== History ==
[[Image:MPI-BPC-Göttingen 05.2006.jpg|thumb|250px|Aerial picture of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen (Picture: Jörg Winkler, 2007)]] The history of the Institute goes back to the year 1949. At that time, the Max Planck Society established the Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry in Göttingen as follow-up of the former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer, who already worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, became the founding director of the new institute. He was one of the first researchers who applied physical-chemical methods in biological research and thus combined different disciplines of natural sciences in research.

The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry was created in 1971 by merging the Max Planck Institutes for Physical Chemistry and for Spectroscopy in Göttingen. This was mainly initiated by Nobel Prize laureate [[Manfred Eigen]], who was at that time director of the Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry. His vision of an interdisciplinary approach to biological research was decisive and the creative impulse for the development of the institute. In honour of Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer, the new institute was named after him.

Although the institute is dedicated to basic research – by virtue of the charter of the Max Planck Society – its policy has been to encourage the transfer of numerous technological innovations to the marketplace. As a consequence, many licensing agreements and start-up firms have arisen from research conducted at the institute, e. g. [[Lambda Physik]] (today part of Coherent), [[DeveloGen]] (today part of [[Evotec]]) and [[Evotec]].

== Research ==

=== Research Focus ===
Research at the institute focuses on the fundamental mechanisms that regulate and control life processes: How is genetic information correctly translated into proteins? How do nerve cells communicate with each other? How is cellular logistics controlled? On the organismal level, researchers at the Institute study the circadian rhythms of the vertebrate, or differentiation and development in multicellular organisms.

To obtain even deeper insights into the nanocosmos of living cells, the institute employs ultra-high resolution microscopy, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] and tomography, [[mass spectrometry]], [[optical spectroscopy]], or atomistic computer simulations. At the same time the Institute concentrates on developing novel measurement and analysis methods to provide a closer look into the world of molecules.

=== Departments ===
The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry currently encompasses 12 departments:

* '''Prof. Patrick Cramer''' - ''Molecular Biology''
* '''Prof. Gregor Eichele''' - ''Genes and Behavior''
* '''Prof. Dirk Görlich''' - ''Cellular Logistics''
* '''Prof. Christian Griesinger''' - ''NMR-based Structural Biology''
* '''Prof. Helmut Grubmüller''' - ''Theoretical and Computational Biophysics''
* '''Prof. [[Peter Gruss]]''' - ''Molecular Cell Biology''
* '''Prof. [[Stefan Hell|Stefan W. Hell]]''' - ''NanoBiophotonics''
* '''Prof. Herbert Jäckle''' - ''Molecular Developmental Biology''
* '''Prof. Reinhard Jahn''' - ''Neurobiology''
* '''Prof. Reinhard Lührmann''' - ''Cellular Biochemistry''
* '''Prof. Marina Rodnina''' - ''Physical Biochemistry''
* '''Prof. Alec M. Wodtke''' - ''Dynamics at Surfaces''

=== Research Groups ===
The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry is particularly engaged in the support of junior scientists. 31 independent research groups pursue their own research goals.

=== Emeritus Groups ===
After retiring, directors of the Institute can actively continue their research for a couple of years.

* '''Prof. Thomas Jovin''' - ''Laboratory for Cellular Dynamics''
* '''Prof. [[Erwin Neher]]''' - ''Membrane Biophysics''
* '''Prof. Jürgen Troe''' - ''Spectroscopy and Photochemical Kinetics''

=== Former Departments ===
The Institute has undergone a permanent change in research with the closing of departments after their heads have retired and by continuously establishing new departments. Some of the former directors pursue their research even after their Emeritus Group has expired and can still be contacted at the institute (*).

=== Biomedizinische NMR Forschungs GmbH ===
The institute also accommodates the independent [http://www.biomednmr.mpg.de Biomedizinische NMR Forschungs GmbH] headed by [[Jens Frahm]], which was founded in 1993. The focus of this association is the development and application of spatially resolved NMR techniques for non-invasive studies of the central nervous system in animals and humans. These innovative approaches allow for unique insights into the structure, metabolism and function of the intact living brain. Jens Frahm and his coworkers invented a rapid acquisition technique for magnetic resonance imaging termed [[FLASH MRI]] (fast low angle shot) technique which allowed for a 100-fold reduction of the measuring times of cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The FLASH technique led the ground for many modern MRI applications in diagnostic imaging.

== International Max Planck Research Schools ==
In 2000, two '''International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS)''' were established together with the [http://www.uni-goettingen.de/ Georg August University Göttingen], the [http://www.dpz.eu/ German Primate Center] and the [http://www.em.mpg.de/ Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine]: the [[IMPRS for Molecular Biology]] and the [[IMPRS for Neurosciences]] (in cooperation with the [http://www.ds.mpg.de/ Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization] and the [http://www.eni.gwdg.de/ European Neuroscience Institute Göttingen]). A third graduate school, the IMPRS for Physics of Biological and Complex Systems, was opened in 2008 (in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57236">'''Metacognition''' is "[[cognition]] about cognition", "[[think]]ing about thinking", "[[know]]ing about knowing", becoming "aware of one's [[awareness]]" and higher-order thinking skills. The term comes from the root word ''[[meta]]'', meaning "beyond".&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"&gt;Metcalfe, J., &amp; Shimamura, A. P. (1994). ''Metacognition: knowing about knowing''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Metacognition can take many forms; it includes knowledge about when and how to use particular strategies for learning or problem-solving.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe" /&gt; There are generally two components of metacognition: (1) knowledge about cognition and (2) regulation of cognition.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Schraw |first= Gregory |title= Promoting general metacognitive awareness |journal= Instructional Science|year= 1998|volume= 26|pages= 113–125|doi= 10.1023/A:1003044231033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metamemory]], defined as knowing about memory and [[mnemonic]] strategies, is an especially important form of metacognition.&lt;ref name="Dunlosky"&gt;Dunlosky, J. &amp; Bjork, R. A. (Eds.). ''Handbook of Metamemory and Memory''.

Some [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologist]]s hypothesize that humans use metacognition as a survival tool, which would make metacognition the same across cultures.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;{{qn|date=May 2017}} Writings on metacognition date back at least as far as two works by the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384-322 BC): ''[[On the Soul]]'' and the ''[[Parva Naturalia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

==Definitions==
This higher-level cognition was given the label metacognition by American developmental psychologist [[John H. Flavell]] (1976).

The term metacognition literally means 'beyond cognition', and is used to indicate cognition about cognition, or more informally, thinking about thinking. Flavell defined metacognition as knowledge about cognition and control of cognition. For example, a person is engaging in metacognition if he notices that he is having more trouble learning A than B, or if it strikes him that he should double-check C before accepting it as fact. J. H. Flavell (1976, p.&amp;nbsp;232).  [[Andreas Demetriou]]'s theory (one of the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]) used the term hypercognition to refer to self-monitoring, self-representation, and self-regulation processes, which are regarded as integral components of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A., Efklides, A., &amp; Platsidou, M. (1993). The architecture and dynamics of developing mind: Experiential structuralism as a frame for unifying cognitive developmental theories. ''Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 58'', Serial Number 234.
&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, with his colleagues, he showed that these processes participate in general [[intelligence]], together with processing efficiency and reasoning, which have traditionally been considered to compose [[fluid intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Demetriou|first1 = A.|last2 = Kazi|first2 = S.|year = 2006|title = Self-awareness in g (with processing efficiency and reasoning)|url=|journal=Intelligence|volume = 34|issue =3|pages = 297–317|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2005.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metacognition also involves thinking about one's own thinking process such as study skills, memory capabilities, and the ability to monitor learning.  This concept needs to be explicitly taught along with content instruction.
Metacognitive knowledge is about one's own cognitive processes and the understanding of how to regulate those processes to maximize learning.

Some types of metacognitive knowledge would include:
* Content knowledge (declarative knowledge) which is understanding one's own capabilities, such as a student evaluating his/her own knowledge of a subject in a class. It is notable that not all metacognition is accurate. Studies have shown that students often mistake lack of effort with understanding in evaluating themselves and their overall knowledge of a concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.pearsonassessments.com/images/tmrs/metacognition_literature_review_final.pdf|title=Metacognition: A Literature Review|last=Lai|first=Emily|date=April 2011|website=Metacognition: A Literature Review PDF|format=PDF|access-date=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, greater confidence in having performed well  is associated with less accurate metacognitive judgment of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molenberghs|first=Pascal|last2=Trautwein|first2=Fynn-Mathis|last3=Böckler|first3=Anne|last4=Singer|first4=Tania|last5=Kanske|first5=Philipp|date=2016-12-01|title=Neural correlates of metacognitive ability and of feeling confident: a large-scale fMRI study|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|volume=11|issue=12|pages=1942–1951|doi=10.1093/scan/nsw093|issn=1749-5024|pmc=5141950|pmid=27445213}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Task knowledge (procedural knowledge), which is how one perceives the difficulty of a task which is the content, length, and the type of assignment. The study mentioned in Content knowledge also deals with a person's ability to evaluate the difficulty of a task related to their overall performance on the task. Again, the accuracy of this knowledge was skewed as students who thought their way was better/easier also seemed to perform worse on evaluations, while students who were rigorously and continually evaluated reported to not be as confident but still did better on initial evaluations.
* Strategic knowledge (conditional knowledge) which is one's own capability for using strategies to learn information. Young children are not particularly good at this; it is not until students are in upper elementary school that they begin to develop an understanding of effective strategies.
Metacognition is a general term encompassing the study of memory-monitoring and self-regulation, meta-reasoning, [[consciousness]]/[[awareness]] and auto-consciousness/[[self-awareness]]. In practice these capacities are used to regulate one's own cognition, to maximize one's potential to think, [[learning|learn]] and to the evaluation of proper [[ethics|ethical]]/[[Morality|moral rules]]. It can also lead to a reduction in response time for a given situation as a result of heightened awareness, and potentially reduce the time to complete problems or tasks.

In the domain of experimental psychology, an influential distinction in metacognition (proposed by T. O. Nelson &amp; L. Narens) is between Monitoring&amp;mdash;making judgments about the strength of one's memories&amp;mdash;and Control&amp;mdash;using those judgments to guide behavior (in particular, to guide study choices). Dunlosky, Serra, and Baker (2007) covered this distinction in a review of metamemory research that focused on how findings from this domain can be applied to other areas of applied research.

In the domain of [[cognitive neuroscience]], metacognitive monitoring and control has been viewed as a function of the [[prefrontal cortex]], which receives (monitors) sensory signals from other cortical regions and  implements control using feedback loops(see chapters by Schwartz &amp; Bacon and Shimamura, in Dunlosky &amp; Bjork, 2008).&lt;ref name="Dunlosky"/&gt;

Metacognition is studied in the domain of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Scientific modelling|modelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.artint.2005.10.009 | volume=169 | issue=2 | title=Metacognition in computation: A selected research review | journal=Artificial Intelligence | pages=104–141| year=2005 | last1=Cox | first1=Michael T. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is the domain of interest of emergent [[systemics]].

It has been used, albeit off the original definition, to describe one's own knowledge that we will die. Writers in the 1990s involved with the [[grunge]] music scene often used the term to describe self-awareness of mortality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Components==
Metacognition is classified into three components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flavell|first=J.H.|title=Metacognition and cognitive monitoring. A new area of cognitive-development inquiry|journal=American Psychologist|year=1979|volume=34|pages=906–911|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Metacognitive knowledge'' (also called metacognitive awareness) is what individuals know about themselves and others as cognitive processors.
# ''Metacognitive regulation'' is the regulation of cognition and learning experiences through a set of activities that help people control their learning.
# ''Metacognitive experiences'' are those experiences that have something to do with the current, on-going cognitive endeavor.

Metacognition refers to a level of thinking that involves active control over the process of thinking that is used in learning situations.  Planning the way to approach a learning task, monitoring comprehension, and evaluating the progress towards the completion of a task: these are skills that are metacognitive in their nature.

Metacognition includes at least three different types of metacognitive awareness when considering metacognitive knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=J.E.|author2=Paris, S.G.|title=Children's metacognition about reading: Issues in definition, measurement, and instruction|journal=[[Educational Psychologist (journal)|Educational Psychologist]]|year=1987|volume=22|pages=225–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Declarative knowledge'': refers to knowledge about oneself as a learner and about what factors can influence one's performance.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt; Declarative knowledge can also be referred to as "world knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schneider|first=W|author2=Artelt, C.|title=Metacognition and mathematics education|journal=ZDM Mathematics Education|year=2010|volume=42|issue=2|pages=149–161|doi=10.1007/s11858-010-0240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Procedural knowledge'': refers to knowledge about doing things. This type of knowledge is displayed as heuristics and strategies.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt; A high degree of procedural knowledge can allow individuals to perform tasks more automatically. This is achieved through a large variety of strategies that can be accessed more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pressley|first=M |author2=Borkowski, J.G. |author3=Schneider, W.|title=Cognitive strategies: Good strategy users coordinate metacognition and knowledge|journal=Annals of Child Development|year=1987|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Conditional knowledge'': refers to knowing when and why to use declarative and procedural knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garner|first=R|title=When children and adults do not use learning strategies: Toward a theory of settings|journal=Review of Educational Research|year=1990|volume=60|pages=517–529|doi=10.3102/00346543060004517|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows students to allocate their resources when using strategies. This in turn allows the strategies to become more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=R.E.|title=Selective attention and prose learning: Theoretical and empirical research|journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]]|year=1992|volume=4|pages=345–391|doi=10.1007/BF01332144|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive regulation or "regulation of cognition" contains three skills that are essential.&lt;ref name="Schraw 1998 113–125"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=J.E.|author2=Paris, S.G.|title=Children's metacognition about reading: Issues in definition, measurement, and instruction|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=1987|volume=22|issue=3–4|pages=255–278|doi=10.1080/00461520.1987.9653052}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Planning'': refers to the appropriate selection of strategies and the correct allocation of resources that affect task performance.
# ''Monitoring'': refers to one's awareness of comprehension and task performance
# ''Evaluating'': refers to appraising the final product of a task and the efficiency at which the task was performed. This can include re-evaluating strategies that were used.

Similarly, maintaining motivation to see a task to completion is also a metacognitive skill. The ability to become aware of distracting stimuli &amp;ndash; both internal and external &amp;ndash; and sustain effort over time also involves metacognitive or [[executive functions]]. The theory that metacognition has a critical role to play in successful learning means it is important that it be demonstrated by both students and teachers.

Students who demonstrate a wide range of metacognitive skills perform better on exams and complete work more efficiently{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. They are self-regulated learners who utilize the "right tool for the job" and modify learning strategies and skills based on their awareness of effectiveness. Individuals with a high level of metacognitive knowledge and skill identify blocks to learning as early as possible and change "tools" or strategies to ensure goal attainment. Swanson (1990) found that metacognitive knowledge can compensate for IQ and lack of prior knowledge when comparing fifth and sixth grade students' problem solving. Students with a high-metacognition were reported to have used fewer strategies, but solved problems more effectively than low-metacognition students, regardless of IQ or prior knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swanson|first=H.L.|title=Influence of metacognitive knowledge and aptitude on problem solving|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1990|volume=82|pages=306–314|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.82.2.306|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study examining students who send text messages during college lectures, it was suggested that students with higher metacognitive abilities were less likely than other students to have their learning affected by using a mobile phone in class.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, L. D., Lim, A. F., Carrier, L. M., &amp; Cheever, N. A. (2011). An empirical examination of the educational impact of message-induced task switching in the classroom: Educational implications and strategies to enhance learning. Psicología Educativa, 17(2), 163-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.|[[Bertrand Russell]]}}
Metacognologists are aware of their own strengths and weaknesses, the nature of the task at hand, and available "tools" or skills. A broader repertoire of "tools" also assists in goal attainment. When "tools" are general, generic, and context independent, they are more likely to be useful in different types of learning situations.

Another distinction in metacognition is executive management and strategic knowledge. Executive management processes involve planning, monitoring, evaluating and revising one's own thinking processes and products. Strategic knowledge involves knowing ''what'' (factual or declarative knowledge), knowing ''when and why'' (conditional or contextual knowledge) and knowing ''how'' (procedural or methodological knowledge). Both executive management and strategic knowledge metacognition are needed to self-regulate one's own thinking and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, there is no distinction between domain-general and domain-specific metacognitive skills.  This means that metacognitive skills are domain-general in nature and there are no specific skills for certain subject areas. The metacognitive skills that are used to review an essay are the same as those that are used to verify an answer to a math question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gourgey|first=A.F.|title=Metacognition in basic skills instruction|journal=Instructional Science|year=1998|volume=26|pages=81–96|doi=10.1023/A:1003092414893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Metacognition ==
Although metacognition has thus far been discussed in relation to the self, recent research in the field has suggested that this view is overly restrictive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jost|first=J. T.|last2=Kruglanski|first2=A. W.|last3=Nelson|first3=T. O.|date=1998|title=Social metacognition: an expansionist review|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review: An Official Journal of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc|volume=2|issue=2|pages=137–154|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0202_6|issn=1088-8683|pmid=15647141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is argued that metacognition research should also include beliefs about others’ mental processes, the influence of culture on those beliefs, and on beliefs about ourselves. This “expansionist view” proposes that it is impossible to fully understand metacognition without considering the situational norms and cultural expectations that influence those same conceptions. This combination of social psychology and metacognition is referred to as social metacognition. 

Social metacognition can include ideas and perceptions that relate to [[social cognition]]. Additionally, social metacognition can include judging the cognition of others, such as judging the perceptions and emotional states of others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is in part because the process of judging others is similar to judging the self.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, individuals have less information about the people they are judging; therefore, judging others tend to be more inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tullis|first=Jonathan G.|last2=Fraundorf|first2=Scott H.|date=2017-08|title=Predicting others' memory performance: The accuracy and bases of social metacognition|journal=Journal of Memory and Language|volume=95|pages=124–137|doi=10.1016/j.jml.2017.03.003|issn=0749-596X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having similar cognitions can buffer against this inaccuracy and can be helpful for teams or organizations, as well as interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thompson|first=Leigh|last2=Cohen|first2=Taya R.|date=2012-01-01|title=Metacognition in teams and organizations|url=https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/metacognition-in-teams-and-organizations-2|journal=Social Metacognition|pages=283–302|doi=10.4324/9780203865989|isbn=9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social Metacognition and the Self Concept ===
The self concept plays an important part in how people think about and act in their social worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scirp.org/(S(351jmbntvnsjt1aadkposzje))/reference/ReferencesPapers.aspx?ReferenceID=424661|title=Baumeister, R. F. (1998). The self. In D. T. Gilbert, S. T. Fiske, &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), The handbook of social psychology (4th ed., Vol. 1, pp. 635-679). Boston, MA McGraw-Hill Co., Inc. - References - Scientific Research Publishing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.scirp.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metacognitions can be divided into first order and second order thoughts. First order thoughts are the person’s first appraisal of a given thought (I am smart), while second order thoughts are their reflections about their certainty of that appraisal (I am not really sure how smart I am). These secondary cognitions are subject to the influence of culture and situational norms, and thus influence the strength of our self-convictions.

An example of the interaction between social metacognition and self-concept can be found in examining implicit theories about the self. Implicit theories can cover a wide-range of constructs about how the self operates, but two are especially relevant here; entity theory and incrementalist theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dweck|first=Carol S.|last2=Chiu|first2=Chi-yue|last3=Hong|first3=Ying-yi|date=1995-10|title=Implicit Theories and Their Role in Judgments and Reactions: A Word From Two Perspectives|journal=Psychological Inquiry|language=en|volume=6|issue=4|pages=267–285|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0604_1|issn=1047-840X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entity theory proposes that an individual’s self-attributes and abilities are fixed and stable, while incrementalist theory proposes that these same constructs can be changed through effort and experience. Entity theorists are susceptible to learned helplessness because they may feel that circumstances are outside their control (i.e. there’s nothing that could have been done to make things better), thus they may give up easily. Incremental theorists react differently when faced with failure: they desire to master challenges, and therefore adopt a mastery-oriented pattern.  They immediately began to consider various ways that they could approach the task differently, and they increase their efforts. Cultural beliefs can act on this as well. For example, a person who has accepted a cultural belief that memory loss is an unavoidable consequence of old age may avoid cognitively demanding tasks as they age, thus accelerating cognitive decline.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy|first=B.|last2=Langer|first2=E.|date=1994-6|title=Aging free from negative stereotypes: successful memory in China and among the American deaf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=66|issue=6|pages=989–997|issn=0022-3514|pmid=8046582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a female who is aware of the stereotype that purports that females are not good at mathematics may perform worse on tests of mathematical ability or avoid mathematics altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steele|first=Jennifer R.|last2=Ambady|first2=Nalini|date=2006-07|title="Math is Hard!" The effect of gender priming on women's attitudes|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=4|pages=428–436|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.06.003|issn=0022-1031}}&lt;/ref&gt; These examples demonstrate that the metacognitive beliefs people hold about the self - which may be socially or culturally transmitted - can have important effects on persistence, performance, and motivation.

=== Attitudes as a Function of Social Metacognition ===
The way that individuals think about attitude greatly affects the way that they behave. Metacognitions about attitudes influence how individuals act, and especially how they interact with others.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203865989|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=21–42|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some metacognitive characteristics of attitudes include importance, certainty, and perceived knowledge, and they influence behavior in different ways.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Attitude importance is the strongest predictor of behavior and can predict information seeking behaviors in individuals. Attitude importance is also more likely to influence behavior than certainty of the attitude.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When considering a social behavior like voting a person may hold high importance but low certainty. This means that they will likely vote, even if they are unsure who to vote for. Meanwhile, a person who is very certain of who they want to vote for, may not actually vote if it is of low importance to them. This also applies to interpersonal relationships. A person might hold a lot of favorable knowledge about their family, but they may not maintain close relations with their family if it is of low importance.

Metacognitive characteristics of attitudes may be key to understanding how attitudes change. Research shows that the frequency of positive or negative thoughts is the biggest factor in attitude change.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9780203865989|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=43 – 62|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person may believe that climate change is occurring but have negative thoughts toward it such as “If I accept the responsibilities of climate change, I must change my lifestyle.” These individuals would not likely change their behavior compared to someone that thinks positively about the same issue such as “By using less electricity, I will be helping the planet.”

Another way to increase the likelihood of behavior change is by influencing the source of the attitude. An individual’s personal thoughts and ideas have a much greater impact on the attitude compared ideas of others.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Therefore, when people view lifestyle changes as coming from themselves, the effects are more powerful than if the changes were coming from a friend or family member. These thoughts can be re-framed that emphasizes personal importance, such as “I want to stop smoking because it is important to me” rather than “quitting smoking is important to my family”. More research needs to be conducted on culture differences and importance of group ideology, which may alter these results.

=== Social Metacognition and Stereotypes ===
People have secondary cognitions about the appropriateness, justifiability, and social judgability of their own stereotypic beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Metacognition|last=Briñol|first=Pablo|date=2012-04-27|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780203865989|location=|pages=243–262|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203865989}}&lt;/ref&gt; People know that it is typically unacceptable to make stereotypical judgments and make conscious efforts not to do so. Subtle social cues can influence these conscious efforts. For example, when given a false sense of confidence about their ability to judge others, people will return to relying on social stereotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yzerbyt|first=Vincent Y.|last2=Schadron|first2=Georges|last3=Leyens|first3=Jacques-Philippe|last4=Rocher|first4=Stephan|date=1994|title=Social judgeability: The impact of meta-informational cues on the use of stereotypes.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=66|issue=1|pages=48–55|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.1.48|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural backgrounds influence social metacognitive assumptions, including stereotypes. For example, cultures without the stereotype that memory declines with old age display no age differences in memory performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

When it comes to making judgments about other people, implicit theories about the stability versus malleability of human characteristics predict differences in social stereotyping as well. Holding an entity theory of traits increases the tendency for people to see similarity among group members and utilize stereotyped judgments. For example, compared to those holding incremental beliefs, people who hold entity beliefs of traits use more stereotypical trait judgments of ethnic and occupational groups as well as form more extreme trait judgments of new groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Plaks|first=Jason E.|last2=Stroessner|first2=Steven J.|last3=Dweck|first3=Carol S.|last4=Sherman|first4=Jeffrey W.|date=2001|title=Person theories and attention allocation: Preferences for stereotypic versus counterstereotypic information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=80|issue=6|pages=876–893|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.876|issn=1939-1315|url=http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/7sb722b1|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; When individual’s assumptions about a group combine with their implicit theories, more stereotypical judgments may be form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yzerbyt|first=Vincent|last2=Corneille|first2=Olivier|last3=Estrada|first3=Claudia|date=2001-05|title=The Interplay of Subjective Essentialism and Entitativity in the Formation of Stereotypes|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=141–155|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0502_5|issn=1088-8683|citeseerx=10.1.1.379.4076}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypes that one believes others hold about them are called metastereotypes.

==Relation to sapience==
Metacognologists believe that the ability to consciously think about thinking is unique to [[sapience|sapient]] species and indeed is one of the definitions of sapience.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} There is evidence that [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]], apes, and dolphins can make accurate judgments about the strengths of their memories of fact and monitor their own uncertainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1037/a0020129|last = Couchman|first = Justin J.|author2=Coutinho, M.

==Strategies==
Metacognitive-like processes are especially ubiquitous when it comes to the discussion of [[self-regulated learning]]. Being engaged in metacognition is a salient feature of good self-regulated learners.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Reinforcing collective discussion of metacognition is a salient feature of self-critical and self-regulating social groups.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  The activities of strategy selection and application include those concerned with an ongoing attempt to plan, check, monitor, select, revise, evaluate, etc.

Metacognition is 'stable' in that learners' initial decisions derive from the pertinent facts about their cognition through years of learning experience. Simultaneously, it is also 'situated' in the sense that it depends on learners' familiarity with the task, motivation, emotion, and so forth. Individuals need to regulate their thoughts about the strategy they are using and adjust it based on the situation to which the strategy is being applied.  At a professional level, this has led to emphasis on the development of [[reflective practice]], particularly in the education and health-care professions.

Recently, the notion has been applied to the study of second language learners in the field of [[English as a foreign or second language|TESOL]] and [[applied linguistics]] in general (e.g., Wenden, 1987; Zhang, 2001, 2010). This new development has been much related to Flavell (1979), where the notion of metacognition is elaborated within a tripartite theoretical framework. Learner metacognition is defined and investigated by examining their person knowledge, task knowledge and strategy knowledge.

Wenden (1991) has proposed and used this framework and Zhang (2001) has adopted this approach and investigated second language learners' metacognition or metacognitive knowledge. In addition to exploring the relationships between learner metacognition and performance, researchers are also interested in the effects of metacognitively-oriented strategic instruction on reading comprehension (e.g., Garner, 1994, in first language contexts, and Chamot, 2005; Zhang, 2010). The efforts are aimed at developing [[learner autonomy]], [[interdependence]] and [[Self-regulated learning|self-regulation]].

Metacognition helps people to perform many cognitive tasks more effectively.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt; Strategies for promoting metacognition include self-questioning (e.g. "What do I already know about this topic? How have I solved problems like this before?"), thinking aloud while performing a task, and making graphic representations (e.g. concept maps, flow charts, semantic webs) of one's thoughts and knowledge.  Carr, 2002, argues that the physical act of writing plays a large part in the development of metacognitive skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gammil | first1 = D. | year = 2006 | title = Learning the Write Way | url = | journal = The Reading Teacher | volume = 59 | issue = 8| pages = 754–762 | doi = 10.1598/RT.59.8.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strategy Evaluation matrices (SEM) can help to improve the ''knowledge of cognition'' component of metacognition.  The SEM works by identifying the declarative (Column 1), procedural (Column 2) and conditional (Column 3 and 4) knowledge about specific strategies.  The SEM can help individuals identify the strength and weaknesses about certain strategies as well as introduce them to new strategies that they can add to their repertoire.&lt;ref name="Schraw1998a"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schraw|first=Gregory|title=Promoting general metacogntive awareness|journal=Instructional Science|year=1998|volume=26|pages=113–125|doi=10.1023/A:1003044231033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regulation checklist (RC) is a useful strategy for improving the regulation of cognition aspect of one's metacognition. RCs help individuals to implement a sequence of thoughts that allow them to go over their own metacognition.&lt;ref name="Schraw1998a"/&gt; King (1991) found that fifth-grade students who used a regulation checklist outperformed control students when looking at a variety of questions including written problem solving, asking strategic questions, and elaborating information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=King|first=A|title=Effects of training in strategic questioning on children's problem solving performance|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|year=1991|volume=83|pages=307–317|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.83.3.307|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of strategies that can be taught to students are word analysis skills, active reading strategies, listening skills, organizational skills and creating mnemonic devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=L|author2=Thompson, M.|title=Neurofeedback combined with training in metacognitive strategies: Effectiveness in students with ADD|journal=Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback|year=1998|volume=23|issue=4|pages=243–63|doi=10.1023/A:1022213731956|pmid=10457815}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walker and Walker have developed a model of metacognition in school learning termed [[Steering cognition|Steering Cognition]].  [[Steering cognition|Steering Cognition]] describes the capacity of the mind to exert conscious control over its reasoning and processing strategies in relation to the external learning task. Studies have shown that pupils with an ability to exert metacognitive regulation over their attentional and reasoning strategies used when engaged in maths, and then shift those strategies when engaged in science or then English literature learning, associate with higher academic outcomes at secondary school.

==Metastrategic knowledge==
"Metastrategic knowledge" (MSK) is a sub-component of metacognition that is defined as general knowledge about higher order thinking strategies. MSK had been defined as "general knowledge about the cognitive procedures that are being manipulated". The knowledge involved in MSK consists of "making generalizations and drawing rules regarding a thinking strategy" and of "naming" the thinking strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, A., &amp; Ben David, A. (2009). Paving a clear path in a thick forest: A conceptual analysis of a metacognitive component. Metacognition And Learning, 4(3), 177-195. {{DOI|10.1007/s11409-009-9044-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The important conscious act of a metastrategic strategy is the "conscious" awareness that one is performing a form of higher order thinking. MSK is an awareness of the type of thinking strategies being used in specific instances and it consists of the following abilities: making generalizations and drawing rules regarding a thinking strategy, naming the thinking strategy, explaining when, why and how such a thinking strategy should be used, when it should not be used, what are the disadvantages of not using appropriate strategies, and what task characteristics call for the use of the strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Veenman, M. V. J. (2006). Metacognition: Definitions, constituents, and their intricate relation with cognition. Symposium organized by Marcel V. J. Veenman, Anat Zohar, and Anastasia Efklides for the 2nd conference of the EARLI SIG on Metacognition (SIG 16), Cambridge, UK, 19–21 July.&lt;/ref&gt;

MSK deals with the broader picture of the conceptual problem. It creates rules to describe and understand the physical world around the people who utilize these processes called [[higher-order thinking]]. This is the capability of the individual to take apart complex problems in order to understand the components in problem. These are the building blocks to understanding the "big picture" (of the main problem) through reflection and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, N., &amp; Moneta, G. B. (2012). Coping and perceived stress as a function of positive metacognitions and positive meta-emotions. Individual Differences Research, 10(2), 105–116.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Action==

Both social and cognitive dimensions of sporting expertise can be adequately explained from a metacognitive perspective according to recent research. The potential of metacognitive inferences and domain-general skills including psychological skills training  are  integral to the genesis of expert performance. Moreover, the contribution of both mental imagery (e.g., mental practice) and attentional strategies (e.g., routines) to our understanding of expertise and metacognition is noteworthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = MacIntyre | first1 = TE | last2 = Igou | first2 = ER | last3 = Campbell | first3 = MJ | last4 = Moran | first4 = AP | last5 = Matthews | first5 = J | year = 2014 | title = Metacognition and action: a new pathway to understanding social and cognitive aspects of expertise in sport | url = | journal = Front.

The potential of metacognition to illuminate our understanding of action was first highlighted by Aidan Moran who discussed the role of meta-attention in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Moran A. P. (1996). The Psychology of Concentration in Sport Performers: A Cognitive Analysis. Hove, East Sussex: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; A recent research initiative,  a research seminar series called [http://www.meta-research.org META] funded by the [[British Psychological Society|BPS]], is exploring the role of the related constructs of meta-motivation, meta-emotion, and thinking and action (metacognition).

==Mental illness==

===Sparks of interest===
In the context of mental health, metacognition can be loosely defined as the process that "reinforces one's subjective sense of being a self and allows for becoming aware that some of one's thoughts and feelings are symptoms of an illness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lysaker, P. H.|author2=Dimaggio, G.|author3=Buck, K. D.|author4=Callaway, S. S.|author5=Salvatore, G.|author6=Carcione, A.|author7=Stanghellini, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Poor insight in schizophrenia: Links between different forms of metacognition with awareness of symptoms, treatment needed, and consequences of illness|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=52|issue=3|pages=253–60|pmid= 21497218|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2010.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in metacognition emerged from a concern for an individual's ability to understand their own mental status compared to others as well as the ability to cope with the source of their distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Semerari | first1 = A. | last2 = Carcione | first2 = A. | last3 = Dimaggio | first3 = G. | last4 = Falcone | first4 = M. | last5 = Nicol | first5 = G. | last6 = Procacci | first6 = M. | last7 = Alleva | first7 = G. | year = 2003 | title = How to evaluate Metacognitive function in psychotherapy?

Metacognition brings many unique insights into the normal daily functioning of a human being. It also demonstrates that a lack of these insights compromises 'normal' functioning. This leads to less healthy functioning. In the [[autism]] spectrum, there is a profound deficit in [[Theory of Mind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lysaker, P. H.|author2= Dimaggio, G.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2011|title=Metacognitive disturbances in people with severe mental illness: Theory, correlates with psychopathology and models of psychotherapy|journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice|volume=84|issue=1|pages= 1–8|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8341.2010.02007.x|pmid=22903827}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In people who identify as alcoholics, there is a belief that the need to control cognitions is an independent predictor of alcohol use over anxiety. Alcohol may be used as a coping strategy for controlling unwanted thoughts and emotions formed by negative perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spada | first1 = M. M. | last2 = Zandvoort | first2 = M. | last3 = Wells | first3 = A. | year = 2007 | title = Metacognitions in problem drinkers | url = | journal = Cognitive Therapy and Research | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 709–716 | doi = 10.1007/s10608-006-9066-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes referred to as [[self medication]].

===Implications===

Wells' and Matthews'&lt;ref&gt;Wells, A. &amp; Mathews, G. (1997). Attention and Emotion. A clinical perspective. Hove, UK: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; theory proposes that when faced with an undesired choice, an individual can operate in two distinct modes: "object" and "metacognitive". Object mode interprets perceived stimuli as truth, where metacognitive mode understands thoughts as cues that have to be weighted and evaluated. They are not as easily trusted. There are targeted interventions unique of each patient, that gives rise to the belief that assistance in increasing metacognition in people diagnosed with schizophrenia is possible through tailored psychotherapy. With a customized therapy in place clients then have the potential to develop greater ability to engage in complex self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lysaker | first1 = P. H. | last2 = Buck | first2 = K. D. | last3 = Carcione | first3 = A. | last4 = Procacci | first4 = M. | last5 = Salvatore | first5 = G. | last6 = Nicolò | first6 = G. | last7 = Dimaggio | first7 = G. | year = 2011 | title = Addressing metacognitive capacity for self-reflection in the psychotherapy for schizophrenia: A conceptual model of the key tasks and processes | url = | journal = Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice | volume = 84 | issue = 1| pages = 58–69 | doi=10.1348/147608310X520436 | pmid=22903831 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can ultimately be pivotal in the patient's recovery process. In the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]], cognitive formulations have greater attention to intrusive thoughts related to the disorder. "Cognitive self-consciousness" are the tendencies to focus attention on thought. Patients with OCD exemplify varying degrees of these "intrusive thoughts". Patients also suffering from [[generalized anxiety disorder]] also show negative thought process in their cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jacobi | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Calamari | first2 = J. E. | last3 = Woodard | first3 = J.

Cognitive-attentional syndrome (CAS) characterizes a metacognitive model of emotion disorder (CAS is consistent with the attention strategy of excessively focusing on the source of a threat). This ultimately develops through the client's own beliefs. [[Metacognitive therapy]] attempts to correct this change in the CAS. One of the techniques in this model is called attention training (ATT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A | year = 1990 | title = Panic disorder in association with relaxation-induced anxiety: An attentional training approach to treatment | url = | journal = Behaviour Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 273–280 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(05)80330-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed to diminish the worry and anxiety by a sense of control and cognitive awareness. ATT also trains clients to detect threats and test how controllable reality appears to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = P. | last3 = Myers | first3 = S. | last4 = Wheatley | first4 = J. | last5 = Patel | first5 = T. | last6 = Brewin | first6 = C.

==Works of art as metacognitive artifacts==
The concept of metacognition has also been applied to [[reader-response criticism]]. [[Narrative]] [[Work of art|works of art]], including novels, movies and musical compositions, can be characterized as metacognitive [[Cultural artifact|artifact]]s which are designed by the artist to anticipate and regulate the beliefs and cognitive processes of the recipient,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Lång, Markus | title=Teksti metakognitiivisena artefaktina: Sanataiteen ja säveltaiteen ontologiaa | journal=Synteesi | volume=17 | issue=4 | year=1998 | pages=82–94 | issn=0359-5242 | url=http://www.mlang.name/metakognitio.html | language=Finnish |trans-title=Text as a Metacognitive Artifact: Literary and Musical Ontology }}&lt;br&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Lång, Markus | title=Elokuva metakognitiivisena artefaktina: Reseptioesteettinen katsaus | journal=Synteesi | volume=21 | issue=1 | year=2002 | pages=59–65 | issn=0359-5242 | url=http://www.mlang.name/elokuva.html | language=Finnish |trans-title=Film as a metacognitive artifact: Reader-response critical review }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, how and in which order events and their causes and identities are revealed to the reader of a detective story. As Menakhem Perry has pointed out, mere order has profound effects on the aesthetical meaning of a text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Perry, Menakhem | year=1979 | title=Literary Dynamics: How the Order of a Text Creates Its Meanings |journal=Poetics Today | volume=1 | issue=1–2 | pages=35–64, 311–361 | jstor=1772040 | doi=10.2307/1772040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative works of art contain a representation of their own ideal reception process. They are something of a tool with which the creators of the work wish to attain certain aesthetical and even moral effects.&lt;ref&gt;Lång 1998, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mind wandering==

There is an intimate, dynamic interplay between [[mind wandering]] and metacognition. Metacognition serves to correct the wandering mind, suppressing spontaneous thoughts and bringing attention back to more "worthwhile" tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kieran|first=C. R. Fox|author2=Kalina Christoff|title=Metacognitive Facilitation of Spontaneous Thought Processes: When Metacognition Helps the Wandering Mind Find Its Way|journal=The Cognitive Neuroscience of Metacognition|date=2014|pages=293–319|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-45190-4_13|isbn=978-3-642-45189-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mind-wandering and metacognition: variation between internal and external thought predicts improved error awareness|url=http://neuroconscience.com/2013/11/08/mind-wandering-and-meta-cognition-variation-between-internal-and-external-thought-predicts-improved-error-awareness/|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizational metacognition ==
The concept of metacognition has also been applied to collective teams and organizations in general, termed [[Corporate Brain|organizational metacognition]].{{Portal|Thinking}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6652">'''Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action (NAMA)''' refers to a set of policies and actions that countries undertake as part of a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The term recognizes that different countries may take different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. It also emphasizes financial assistance from developed countries to developing countries to reduce emissions.

NAMA was first used in the [[Bali Action Plan]] as part of the [[Bali Road Map]] agreed at the [[Bali Conference|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali]] in December 2007, and also formed part of the [[Copenhagen Accord]] issued following the [[COP 15|United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen]] (COP 15) in December 2009.

==History of the use of NAMA in international agreements==

===Bali Action Plan (December 2007)===
The [[Bali Action Plan]] is centered on four main building blocks: (i) Mitigation, (ii) Adaptation, (iii) Technology, and (iv) Financing, with NAMA forming an important part of the mitigation component. 
The Bali Action Plan called for future discussions to address:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/climatechange/docs/UNDP_BAP_Summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Measurable, reportable and verifiable nationally appropriate mitigation commitments or actions by all developed countries, and;''
* ''Nationally appropriate mitigation actions by developing country Parties, supported and enabled by technology, financing and capacity-building, in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner.''.

===Copenhagen Climate Conference (December 2009)===
The [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] did not produce the global agreement envisaged in the Bali Road Map. The Copenhagen Accord, however, did retain the concept of NAMA, but in a narrower definition only applying to Non-Annex 1 countries, and did not specify what form they should take:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.c2es.org/copenhagen-accord&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Non-Annex I Parties to the Convention will implement mitigation actions … consistent with Article 4.1 and Article 4.7 and in the context of sustainable development … Non-Annex I Parties will communicate information on the implementation of their actions through National Communications, with provisions for international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines that will ensure that national sovereignty is respected. '''Nationally appropriate mitigation actions''' seeking international support will be recorded in a registry along with relevant technology, finance and capacity building support. Those actions supported will be added to the list in appendix II. These supported '''nationally appropriate mitigation actions''' will be subject to international measurement, reporting and verification in accordance with guidelines adopted by the Conference of the Parties.''

==What is meant by Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Action?==
* Different countries, different nationally appropriate action on the basis of equity and in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities 
* Developing countries will effectively implement national action depending on the effective implementation of the commitments by developed countries in providing financial resources and transfer of technology. 
* The priorities of developing countries are economic and social development and poverty eradication.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/39/16/40633672.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
India has argued that NAMA means ''voluntary reductions'' by developing countries that ''require to be supported and enabled'' by technology transfer from developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/india100209b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
By definition, NAMAs will vary by country. Indonesia, for example, might focus on integrating climate change policy with other aspects of economic development, such as progressive reduction in oil subsidies, poverty reduction through promotion of alternative income to reduce [[illegal logging]], and exploit more fully the country’s renewable resources, especially geothermal.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt;

==Implementation of NAMA==
In 2010, no NAMAs were implemented yet. The [[Program of Activities (PoA)]] under the [[Clean Development Mechanism]] is regarded a precedor of a future NAMA mechanism and already operational.&lt;ref&gt;Sutter C. and Schibli R., If you want a Nama tomorrow, you need a POA today (March 2011), Trading Carbon, Reuters. Available at: http://www.southpolecarbon.com/_downloads/110300_Namas_TradingCarbon_SPcs-rs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status of NAMA submissions==
As of September 2012, about 50 countries have submitted information of their NAMA to the UNFCCC. The detailed contents of their submissions vary greatly on each country, ranging from their intention to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord, target sectors, specific actions to be taken, to GHG emissions reduction targets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mmechanisms.org/e/namainfo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC, 2012 "Submission of more information by developing country Parties, subject to availability, relating to nationally appropriate mitigation actions, including underlying assumptions and methodologies, sectors and gases covered, global warming potential values used, support needs for implementation of nationally appropriate mitigation actions and estimated mitigation outcomes. Submissions from Parties." FCCC/AWGLCA/2012/MISC.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNFCCC, 2011 "Compilation of information on nationally appropriate mitigation actions to be implemented by Parties not included in Annex I to the Convention." FCCC/AWGLCA/2011/INF.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of NAMA's Submitted==

A list of NAMAs is available at http://www.nama-database.org/.

==Criticism of NAMA==
Some have criticized NAMA as heading away from [[carbon pricing]] and encouraging enormous subsidy programs funded by developed countries and implemented on a voluntary basis by developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Stoft, Steven E., Beyond Kyoto: Flexible Carbon Pricing for Global Cooperation (October 23, 2009).

{{About|the [[Socratic dialogue]] by [[Xenophon]]|the similarly named treatise sometimes said to be written by [[Aristotle]]|Economics (Aristotle)}}
The '''''Oeconomicus''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Οἰκονομικός}}) by [[Xenophon]] is a [[Socratic method|Socratic]] dialogue principally about [[household]] [[management]] and [[agriculture]]. 

It is one of the earliest works on [[economics]] in its original sense of household management, and a significant source for the social and intellectual history of Classical [[history of Athens|Athens]]. Beyond the emphasis on household economics, the dialogue treats such topics as the qualities and relationships of men and women, [[rural]] vs. [[urban area|urban]] life, [[slavery]], [[religion]], and [[education]].

[[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]] states that the ''Oeconomicus'' can actually be seen as a treatise on success in leading both an army and a state.

Scholars lean towards a relatively late date in Xenophon's life for the composition of the ''Oeconomicus'', perhaps after 362 BC. [[Cicero]] translated the ''Oeconomicus'' into [[Latin]], and the work gained popularity during the [[Renaissance]] in a number of translations.

==Summary==
The opening framing dialogue is between  Socrates and Critoboulus, the son of [[Crito of Alopece|Crito]]. There Socrates discusses  the meaning of wealth and identifies it with usefulness and well-being, not merely possessions. He links [[moderation]] and hard [[manual labour|work]] to success in household management. The dramatic date of this part of the work can be no earlier than 401 BC, as the [[Battle of Cunaxa]] is referred to at 4.18.

When Critoboulus asks about the practices involved in household management, Socrates pleads ignorance on the subject but relates what he heard of it from an Athenian  [[gentleman]]-[[farmer]] (''[[kalokagathia|kaloskagathos]]'') named Ischomachus. In the discussion related by Socrates, Ischomachus describes the methods he used to educate his wife in [[housekeeping]], their practices in [[governance|ruling]] and [[training]] slaves, and the [[technology]] involved in farming. Approximately two thirds of the dialogue concerns the discussion between Socrates and Ischomachus. There is no final reversion to further discussion with Critoboulos.

==Commentary and interpretation==
[[Leo Strauss]] wrote a [[political]]-[[philosophical]] commentary on the dialogue. He took the ''Oeconomicus'' as a more [[irony|ironic]] examination of the nature of the gentleman, [[virtue]], and domestic relationships.

[[Michel Foucault]] devoted a chapter in his ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976–1984) to "Ischomachus' Household". He took Xenophon's depiction of the relationship between Ischomachus and his wife as a classical expression of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[ideology]] of [[political power|power]], according to which a man's control of his [[emotions]] was externally reflected in his control of his wife, his slaves, and his political subordinates. 

Following Foucault, [[feminist]] [[scholars]] and [[social history|social historians]] such as [[Sarah B. Pomeroy|Sarah Pomeroy]] have explored the ''Oeconomicus'' as a source for Greek attitudes to the relationship between men and women, but successive interpretations have differed. Some see Xenophon's attitude toward women as [[misogynist]] and [[patriarchal]], while others maintain that he was a proto-feminist in certain ways.  

Some have taken Xenophon's use of Ischomachus as a supposed [[expert]] in the education of a wife as an instance of anachronistic irony, a device used by [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogues]]. This ironic line of interpretation sees Ischomachus as a target of [[satire]] rather than a stand-in for Xenophon. Some have suggested that the Ischomachus of the dialogue is the same man whose family became the subject of ridicule in Athenian political oratory. After this Ischomachus died, his widow moved in with her daughter and son-in-law Callias and soon became pregnant with the man's child, which eventually led to the daughter's [[suicide]] attempt. Callias was frequently parodied in Athenian comedies for his [[Human sexuality|sexual]] excesses and [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectualism]].

The import of such irony has also been the subject of much contention: are his wife's actions a sign of a bad education or just the inevitable result of the loss of the controlling influence in her life? How responsible was Ischomachus for his daughter's marriage to a man of such poor [[moral character|character]]?

'''PROBA-2''' is the second satellite in the [[European Space Agency]]'s series of [[PROBA]] low-cost [[satellite]]s that are being used to validate new spacecraft technologies while also carrying scientific instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Technology/Proba_Missions/About_Proba-2 |title=About PROBA-2 |date=2012-12-02 |publisher=[[ESA]] |accessdate = 2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; PROBA-2 is a small satellite (130&amp;nbsp;kg) developed under an ESA General Support Technology Program (GSTP) contract by a Belgian consortium led by Verhaert (now [[QinetiQ|QinetiQ Space]]) of Kruibeke, Belgium. The nominal mission duration was two years.&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt; The mission's most recent extension runs to {{Date|2016-12-31}}.&lt;ref name=ex2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/director-desk/54999-working-life-extensions-for-esas-science-missions/ |title=Working life extensions for ESA’s science missions |date=28 November 2014 |website=ESA Science &amp; Technology |publisher=[[European Space Agency|ESA]] |access-date=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission summary==
It was launched on {{Date|2009-11-2}}, with the [[Rockot]] launch system together with [[ESA]]'s [[Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite|SMOS]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.eoportal.org/didyouknow/080923_did1.html |title=Successful launch qualification test for PROBA-2 |date=2008-09-16 |publisher=[[ESA]] |accessdate=2013-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725074327/http://news.eoportal.org/didyouknow/080923_did1.html |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was launched in a [[Sun-synchronous orbit|sun-synchronous]] [[low Earth orbit]] (altitude of 725&amp;nbsp;km).&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt;

PROBA-2 contains five scientific instruments. Two of them are designated to observe the [[Sun]]: "The Sun Watcher using APS and Image Processing" ([[SWAP (instrument)|SWAP]], an EUV imager) and the "Large Yield Radiometer" ([[LYRA]]), a radiometer made of diamond photodiodes. The Principal investigator teams of both instruments are hosted at the [[Royal Observatory of Belgium]]. This institute will also host the [http://proba2.oma.be PROBA-2 Science Center]  from which the [[SWAP (instrument)|SWAP]] and [[LYRA]] instruments will be operated and their data distributed. There are three other instruments to measure basic space plasma properties: the [[Dual segmented Langmuir probe]] (DSLP)&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt; (developed by the [[Astronomical Institute of Czech Academy of Sciences|Astronomical Institute]] and Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic), the Thermal Plasma Measurement Unit (TPMU), and the Science Grade Vector Magnetometer (SGVM) developed by the [[Technical University of Denmark]].&lt;ref name="eoportal" /&gt;

'''Plant ecology''' is a subdiscipline of [[ecology]] which studies the distribution and [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]] of [[plant]]s, the effects of environmental factors upon the abundance of plants, and the interactions among and between plants and other organisms.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007" /&gt; Examples of these are the distribution of [[temperate deciduous forest]]s in North America, the effects of drought or flooding upon plant survival, and competition among desert plants for water, or effects of herds of grazing animals upon the composition of grasslands.

A global overview of the Earth's major vegetation types is provided by O.W. Archibold.&lt;ref name="Archibold 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Archibold|first=O.W.|title=Ecology of World Vegetation|year=1995|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=London.|isbn=0-412-44290-6|pages=510 p}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He recognizes 11 major vegetation types:  tropical forests, tropical savannas, arid regions (deserts), Mediterranean ecosystems, temperate forest ecosystems, temperate grasslands, coniferous forests, tundra (both polar and high mountain), terrestrial [[wetland]]s, freshwater ecosystems and coastal/marine systems.  This breadth of topics shows the complexity of plant ecology, since it includes plants from floating single-celled algae up to large canopy forming trees.

One feature that defines plants is photosynthesis. One of the most important aspects of plant ecology is the role plants have played in [[Great oxygenation event|creating the oxygenated atmosphere of earth]], an event that occurred some 2 billion years ago. It can be dated by the deposition of banded iron formations, distinctive sedimentary rocks with large amounts of iron oxide.  At the same time, plants began removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, thereby initiating the process of controlling Earth's climate.  A long term trend of the Earth has been toward increasing oxygen and decreasing carbon dioxide, and many other events in the Earth's history, like the first movement of life onto land, are likely tied to this sequence of events.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|title=Plants and Vegetation|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn= 978-0-521-86480-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the early classic books on plant ecology was written by [[John Ernest Weaver|J.E. Weaver]] and [[Frederic Clements|F.E. Clements]].&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, J. E. and F. E. Clements. 1938. Plant Ecology. 2nd edn. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company.&lt;/ref&gt; It talks broadly about plant communities, and particularly the importance of forces like competition and processes like succession.

Plant ecology can also be divided by levels of organization including plant [[ecophysiology]], plant [[population ecology]], [[community ecology]], [[ecosystem ecology]], [[landscape ecology]] and biosphere ecology.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SchulzeEtAl-Book"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDo8hLWtWzgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=plant+ecology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hNeWT-X8BOfJiQLW0LHhCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=plant%20ecology&amp;f=false | title=Plant Ecology | publisher=Springer | year=2005 | accessdate=April 24, 2012 | author=Schulze, Ernst-Detlef|display-authors=etal}} {{ISBN|3-540-20833-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of plants and vegetation is complicated by their form.  First, most [[plant]]s are [[root]]ed in the [[soil]], which makes it difficult to observe and measure nutrient uptake and species interactions.  Second, plants often  [[Vegetative reproduction|reproduce vegetatively]], that is asexually, in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish individual plants. Indeed, the very concept of an individual is doubtful, since even a tree may be regarded as a large collection of linked meristems.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G. C. 1975. Sex and Evolution. Monographs in Population Biology. No. 8. Princeton: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, plant ecology and animal ecology have different styles of approach to problems that involve processes like reproduction, dispersal and mutualism. Some plant ecologists have placed considerable emphasis upon trying to treat plant populations as if they were animal populations, focusing on population ecology.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, J. L. 1977. Population Biology of Plants. London: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other ecologists believe that while it is useful to draw upon population ecology to solve certain scientific problems, plants demand that ecologists work with multiple perspectives, appropriate to the problem, the scale and the situation.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007" /&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of ecology}}
[[File:AvHumboldt.jpg|thumb|150px|Alexander von Humboldt's work connecting plant distributions with environmental factors played an important role in the genesis of the discipline of plant ecology.]]Plant ecology has its origin in the application of [[plant physiology]] to the questions raised by [[plant geography|plant geographers]].&lt;ref name="vanderValk2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=van der Valk|first=Arnold|title=Philosophy of Ecology|editor=Kevin deLaplante |editor2=Bryson Brown |editor3=Kent A. Peacock |publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam|year=2011|series=Handbook of the Philosophy of Science|volume=11|pages=25–48|chapter=Origins and Development of Ecology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Barbour1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barbour|first=Michael G. |author2=Jack H. Burk |author3=Wanna D. Pitts |author4=Frank S. Gilliam |author5=Mark W. Schwartz|title=Terrestrial Plant Ecology|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|year=1999|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–16}} [[Carl Ludwig Willdenow]] was one of the first to note that similar climates produced similar types of vegetation, even when they were located in different parts of the world. Willdenow's student, [[Alexander von Humboldt]], used physiognomy to describe vegetation types and observed that the distribution vegetation types was based on environmental factors. Later plant geographers who built upon Humboldt's work included [[Joakim Frederik Schouw]], [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle|A.P. de Candolle]], [[August Grisebach]] and [[Anton Kerner von Marilaun]]. Schouw's work, published in 1822, linked plant distributions to environmental factors (especially temperature) and established the practice of naming [[association (ecology)|plant associations]] by adding the suffix ''-etum'' to the name of the dominant species. Working from [[herbarium]] collections, De Candolle searched for general rules of plant distribution and settled on using temperature as well.&lt;ref name = "Barbour1999"/&gt;{{rp|14–16}} Grisebach's two-volume work, ''Die Vegetation der Erde nach Ihrer Klimatischen Anordnung'', published in 1872, saw plant geography reach its "ultimate form" as a descriptive field.&lt;ref name="vanderValk2011"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

Starting in the 1870s, Swiss botanist [[Simon Schwendener]], together with his students and colleagues, established the link between [[plant morphology]] and [[plant physiology|physiological]] adaptations, laying the groundwork for the first ecology textbooks, [[Eugenius Warming]]'s ''[[Plantesamfund]]'' (published in 1895) and [[Andreas Franz Wilhelm Schimper|Andreas Schimper]]'s 1898 ''Pflanzengeographie auf Physiologischer Grundlage''.&lt;ref name="vanderValk2011"/&gt; Warming successfully incorporated plant morphology, physiology [[plant taxonomy|taxonomy]] and [[biogeography]] into plant geography to create the field of plant ecology. Although more morphological than physiological, Schimper's has been considered the beginning of plant physiological ecology.&lt;ref name = "Barbour1999"/&gt;{{rp|17–18}} Plant ecology was initially built around static ideas of [[Species distribution|plant distribution]]; incorporating the concept of [[Ecological succession|succession]] added an element to change through time to the field. [[Henry Chandler Cowles]]' studies of plant succession on the [[Lake Michigan]] [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore|sand dunes]] (published in 1899) and [[Frederic Clements]]' 1916 monograph on the subject established it as a key element of plant ecology.&lt;ref name="vanderValk2011"/&gt;

Plant ecology developed within the wider discipline of ecology over the twentieth century. Inspired by Warming's ''Plantesamfund'', [[Arthur Tansley]] set out to map British [[plant community|plant communities]]. In 1904 he teamed up with [[William Gardner Smith (botanist)|William Gardner Smith]] and others involved in vegetation mapping to establish the Central Committee for the Survey and Study of British Vegetation, later shortened to British Vegetation Committee. In 1913, the British Vegetation Committee organised the [[British Ecological Society]] (BES), the first professional society of ecologists.&lt;ref name = "Cooper"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cooper | first1 = W.

Cowles' students played an important role in the development of the field of plant ecology during the first half of the twentieth century, among them [[William Skinner Cooper|William S. Cooper]], [[Emma Lucy Braun|E. Lucy Braun]] and [[Edgar Transeau]].&lt;ref name = "Barbour1999"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

==Distribution==
{{Main|Phytogeography|Species distribution}}
[[File:Biomes.jpg|thumb|500px|right|World biomes are based upon the type of dominant plant.]]

Plant distributions is governed by a combination of historical factors, [[ecophysiology]] and [[biological interaction|biotic interactions]]. The set of species that can be present at a given site is limited by historical contingency. In order to show up, a species must either have evolved in an area or [[biological dispersal|dispersed]] there (either naturally or [[introduced species|through human agency]]), and must not have gone locally extinct. The set of species present locally is further limited to those that possess the [[plant physiology|physiological adaptations]] to survive the environmental conditions that exist. This group is further shaped through interactions with other species.&lt;ref name="Lambers2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambers|first=Hans|author2=F. Stuart Chapin III|author3=Thijs L. Pons|title=Plant Physiological Ecology|year=2008|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

Plant communities are broadly distributed into [[biomes]] based on the form of the dominant plant species. For example, grasslands are dominated by grasses, while forests are dominated by trees. Biomes are determined by regional [[climates]], mostly temperature and precipitation, and follow general latitudinal trends. Within biomes, there may be many [[ecological communities]], which are impacted not only by climate and a variety of smaller-scale features, including [[soils]], [[hydrology]], and [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance regime]]. Biomes also change with elevation, high elevations often resembling those found at higher latitudes.

==Biological interactions==
{{Main|Biological interaction}}

===Competition===
{{Main|Competition (biology)}}

Plants, like most life forms, require relatively few basic elements: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur; hence they are known as CHNOPS life forms. There are also lesser elements needed as well, frequently termed micronutrients, such as magnesium and sodium. When plants grow in close proximity, they may deplete supplies of these elements and have a negative impact upon neighbours. Competition for resources vary from [[size-asymmetric competition|complete symmetric]] (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size) to [[size-asymmetric competition|perfectly size symmetric]] (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely [[size-asymmetric competition|size-asymmetric]] (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry has major effects on the structure and diversity of ecological communities.In many cases (perhaps most) the negative effects upon neighbours arise from size asymmetric competition for light. In other cases, there may be competition below ground for water, nitrogen, or phosphorus. To detect and measure competition, experiments are necessary; these experiments require removing neighbours, and measuring responses in the remaining plants.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|title=Competition|year=2001|publisher=Kluwer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=0-7923-6064-8|pages=552}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many such studies are required before useful generalizations can be drawn.

Overall, it appears that light is the most important resource for which plants compete, and the increase in plant height over evolutionary time likely reflects selection for taller plants to better intercept light. Many plant communities are therefore organized into hierarchies based upon the relative competitive abilities for light.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2001" /&gt;  In some systems, particularly infertile or arid systems, below ground competition may be more significant.&lt;ref&gt;Capser, Brenda B. and Robert. B. Jackson. 1997. Plant competition underground. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 28: 545–570.&lt;/ref&gt;  Along natural gradients of soil fertility, it is likely that the ratio of above ground to below ground competition changes, with higher above ground competition in the more fertile soils.&lt;ref&gt;Belcher, J., P.A. Keddy, and L. Twolan-Strutt. 1995. Root and shoot competition along a soil depth gradient. Journal of Ecology 83: 673–682&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Twolan-Strutt, L. and P.A. Keddy. 1996. Above- and below-ground competition intensity in two contrasting wetland plant communities. Ecology 77: 259–270.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plants that are relatively weak competitors may escape in time (by surviving as buried seeds) or in space (by dispsersing to a new location away from strong competitors.)

In principle, it is possible to examine competition at the level of the limiting resources if a detailed knowledge of the physiological processes of the competing plants is available. However, in most terrestrial ecological studies, there is only little information on the uptake and dynamics of the resources that limit the growth of different plant species, and, instead, competition is inferred from observed negative effects of neighbouring plants without knowing precisely which resources the plants were competing for.  In certain situations, plants may compete for a single growth-limiting resource, perhaps for light in agricultural systems with sufficient water and nutrients, or in dense stands of marsh vegetation, but in many natural [[ecosystem]]s plants may be colimited by several resources, e.g. [[light]], [[phosphorus]] and [[nitrogen]] at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Craine|first= J. M.|year= 2009|title= Resource strategies in wild plants|publisher= Princeton University Press, Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, there are many details that remain to be uncovered, particularly the kinds of competition that arise in natural plant communities, the specific resource(s), the relative importance of different resources, and the role of other factors like stress or disturbance in regulating the importance of competition.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grime, J. P. 1979. Plant Strategies and Vegetation Processes. Chichester: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutualism===
{{Main|Mutualism (biology)}}

Mutualism is defined as an interaction "between two species or individuals that is beneficial to both".  Probably the most widespread example in plants is the mutual beneficial relationship between plants and fungi, known as [[mycorrhiza]]e.  The plant is assisted with nutrient uptake, while the fungus receives carbohydrates. Some the earliest known fossil plants even have fossil mycorrhizae on their rhizomes.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"/&gt;

The flowering plants are a group that have evolved by using two major mutualisms.  First, flowers are pollinated by insects.  This relationship seems to have its origins in beetles feeding on primitive flowers, eating pollen and also acting (unwittingly) as pollinators. Second, fruits are eaten by animals, and the animals then disperse the seeds.   Thus, the flowering plants actually have three major types of mutualism, since most higher plants also have mycorrhizae.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"/&gt;

Plants may also have beneficial effects upon one another, but this is less common.  Examples might include "nurse plants" whose shade allows young cacti to establish. Most examples of mutualism, however, are largely beneficial to only one of the partners, and may not really be true mutualism. The term used for these more one-sided relationships, which are mostly beneficial to one participant, is facilitation. Facilitation among neighboring plants may act by reducing the negative impacts of a stressful environment.&lt;ref name="Callaway95"&gt;Callaway, R. M. 1995. Positive interactions among plants (Interpreting botanical progress). The Botanical Review 61: 306–349.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, facilitation is more likely to occur in physically stressful environments than in favorable environments, where competition may be the most important interaction among species.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, Paul A., ''Competition'', 2nd ed. (2001), Kluwer, Dordrecht. 552 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commensalism]] is similar to facilitation, in that one plant is mostly exploiting another. A familiar example is the ephiphytes which grow on branches of tropical trees, or even mosses which grow on trees in [[temperate deciduous forest|deciduous forests]].

It is important to keep track of the benefits received by each species to determine the appropriate term. Although people are often fascinated by unusual examples, it is important to remember that in plants, the main mutualisms are mycorrhizae, pollination, and seed dispersal.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007"/&gt;

===Herbivory===
{{Main|Herbivory|Plant defense against herbivory}}
[[File:Grazing exclosure Abisko.jpg|alt=Reindeer in front of herbivore exclosures. The vegetation is higher within the fences than outside, showing herbivory pressure. The vegetation is higher within the second fence that excludes both large and smaller herbivores (rodents) underlining the pressure brought by different herbivores.|thumb|Reindeer in front of herbivore exclosures. Excluding different herbivores (here reindeer, or reindeer and rodents) has different effects on the vegetation.]]
An important ecological function of [[plant]]s is that they [[Primary production|produce]] [[organic compound]]s for [[herbivore]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDo8hLWtWzgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=plant+ecology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hNeWT-X8BOfJiQLW0LHhCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=herbivory&amp;f=false | title=Plant Ecology –  (Section 1.10.1: Herbivory) | publisher=Springer | year=2005 | accessdate=April 24, 2012 | author=Schulze, Ernst-Detlef|display-authors=etal}} {{ISBN|3-540-20833-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the bottom of the [[food web]]. A large number of plant traits, from thorns to chemical defenses, can be related to the intensity of herbivory. Large herbivores can also have many effects on vegetation. These include removing selected species, creating gaps for regeneration of new individuals, recycling nutrients, and dispersing seeds.  Certain ecosystem types, such as grasslands, may be dominated by the effects of large herbivores, although fire is also an equally important factor in this biome.  In few cases, herbivores are capable of nearly removing all the vegetation at a site (for example, geese in the Hudson Bay Lowlands of Canada, and nutria in the marshes of Louisiana&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., ''Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation'', 2nd ed. (2010), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK. 497 p. Chapt. 6. Herbivory.&lt;/ref&gt;) but normally herbivores have a more selective impact, particularly when large predators control the abundance of herbivores. The usual method of studying the effects of herbivores is to build exclosures, where they cannot feed, and compare the plant communities in the exclosures to those outside over many years. Often such long term experiments show that herbivores have a significant effect upon the species that make up the plant community.&lt;ref name="Keddy 2007" /&gt;

==Other topics==

===Abundance===
{{Main|Abundance (ecology)}}

The ecological success of a plant species in a specific environment may be quantified by its [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]], and depending on the life form of the plant different measures of abundance may be relevant, e.g. density, [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], or [[plant cover]].

The change in the abundance of a plant species may be due to both [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] factors, e.g. [[climate change]], or [[Biotic component|biotic]] factors, e.g. [[herbivory]] or [[interspecific competition]].

===Colonisation and local extinction===
{{Main|Biogeography}}{{See also|Colonisation (biology)|Biological dispersal|Seed dispersal|Local extinction|Soil seed bank}}

Whether a plant species is present at a local area depends on the processes of [[Colonisation (biology)|colonisation]] and [[local extinction]]. The probability of colonisation decreases with distance to neighboring [[habitat]]s where the species is present and increases with plant abundance and [[fecundity]] in neighboring [[habitat]]s and the [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] distance of the species. The probability of local extinction decreases with abundance (both living plants and seeds in the [[soil seed bank]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3136">The '''printing patent''' or '''printing privilege''' was a precursor of modern [[copyright]]. It was an exclusive right to print a work or a class of works.

The earliest recorded printing privilege dates from 1469, giving [[John of Speyer]] a five-year [[monopoly]] on all printing in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]. In 1495, the city-state granted another monopoly on all Greek works to [[Aldus Manutius|Aldus]] as a reward for his investments in a [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[typeface|font]] for his [[printing press|press]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M. (2002) From Private to Public: Reexamining the Technological Basis for Copyright, ''Journal of Communication'', 52, 416-433&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]], the royal ''Code de la librairie'' of 1723 codified existing practice. It stated that there was no property in ideas or texts. Ideas, it was argued, were a gift from [[God]], revealed through the writer. [[Divine Right of Kings|God's first representative]], the [[Absolute monarchy in France|French king]] had the exclusive right to determine what could be printed by whom. Only members of the royal guild of publishers could apply for a "printing privilege", a permission and an exclusive right to print a work. Authors wishing to see their manuscript printed had no choice but to sell it to guild members. Most printing privileges were owned by the guild and automatically renewed over generations. In 1789, the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] created by the [[French Revolution]] brought an end to all royal privileges.&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, C. (1990) Enlightenment Epistemology and the Laws of Authorship in Revolutionary France, 1777-1793 ''Representations'', 109-137&lt;/ref&gt;

English monarchs granted printing patents based on the [[Royal Prerogative]], with patents falling into one of two categories: ''particular patents'' gave an exclusive right to print a single work &amp;ndash; often popular, classic works written centuries earlier &amp;ndash; for a limited time, usually seven or ten years. ''General patents'' were usually granted for life and covered a class of works, such as law books or [[almanac]]s. Printing patents were independent of the private copyright system established by the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]], even though most printing patents were granted to members of the Company. The importance of printing privileges decreased over time, but they still existed after the [[Statute of Anne]] was enacted.&lt;ref name="Patterson1968"&gt;[[Lyman Ray Patterson|Patterson, L. R.]] (1968) ''[[Copyright in Historical Perspective]]'', Vanderbilt University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The royal prerogative relating to printing patents was not removed until 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Donner, I. (1992) The Copyright Clause of the U. S. Constitution: Why Did the Framers Include It with Unanimous Approval? ''The American Journal of Legal History'' 36(3), 361-378&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6614">'''Robustification''' is a form of optimisation whereby a system is made less sensitive to the effects of random variability, or noise, that is present in that system’s input variables and parameters. The process is typically associated with engineering systems, but the process can also be applied to a political policy, a business strategy or any other system that is subject to the effects of random variability.

==Clarification on definition==
Robustification as it is defined here is sometimes referred to as parameter design or [[robust parameter design (RPD)]] and is often associated with [[Taguchi methods]]. Within that context, robustification can include the process of finding the inputs that contribute most to the random variability in the output and controlling them, or tolerance design. At times the terms design for quality or [[Design for Six Sigma]] (DFSS) might also be used as synonyms.

==Principles==
Robustification works by taking advantage of two different principles.

===Non-linearities===

Consider the graph below of a relationship between an input variable ''x'' and the output ''Y'', for which it is desired that a value of 7 is taken, of a system of interest. It can be seen that there are two possible values that ''x'' can take, 5 and 30. If the tolerance for ''x'' is independent of the nominal value, then it can also be seen that when ''x'' is set equal to 30, the expected variation of ''Y'' is less than if ''x'' were set equal to 5. The reason is that the gradient at ''x'' = 30 is less than at ''x'' = 5, and the random variability in ''x'' is suppressed as it flows to ''Y''.

[[File:Robustification.JPG]]

This basic principle underlies all robustification, but in practice there are typically a number of inputs and it is the suitable point with the lowest gradient on a multi-dimensional surface that must be found.

===Non-constant variability===
Consider a case where an output ''Z'' is a function of two inputs ''x'' and ''y'' that are multiplied by each other. 

''Z'' = ''x y''

For any target value of ''Z'' there is an infinite number of combinations for the nominal values of ''x'' and ''y'' that will be suitable. However, if the standard deviation of ''x'' was proportional to the nominal value and the standard deviation of ''y'' was constant, then ''x'' would be reduced (to limit the random variability that will flow from the right hand side of the equation to the left hand side) and ''y'' would be increased (with no expected increase random variability because the standard deviation is constant) to bring the value of ''Z'' to the target value. By doing this, ''Z'' would have the desired nominal value and it would be expected that its standard deviation would be at a minimum: robustified. 

By taking advantage of the two principles covered above, one is able to optimise a system so that the nominal value of a systems output is kept at its desired level while also minimising the likelihood of any deviation from that nominal value. This is despite the presence of random variability within the input variables.

==Methods==
There are three distinct methods of robustification, but a practitioner might use a mix that provides the best in results, resources and time.

===Experimental===
The experimental approach is probably the most widely known. It involves the identification of those variables that can be adjusted and those variables that are treated as noises. An experiment is then designed to investigate how changes to the nominal value of the adjustable variables can limit the transfer of noise from the noise variables to the output. This approach is attributed to [[Genichi Taguchi|Taguchi]] and is often associated with [[Taguchi methods]]. While many have found the approach to provide impressive results, the techniques have also been criticised for being statistically erroneous and inefficient. Also, the time and effort required can be significant.

Another experimental method that was used for robustification is the Operating Window. It was developed in the [[United States]] before the wave of quality methods from Japan came to the West, but still remains unknown to many.&lt;ref name="Clausing"&gt;See Clausing (2004) reference for more details&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach, the noise of the inputs is continually increased as the system is modified to reduce sensitivity to that noise. This increases robustness, but also provides a clearer measure of the variability that is flowing through the system. After optimisation, the random variability of the inputs is controlled and reduced, and the system exhibits improved quality.

===Analytical===
The analytical approach relies initially on the development of an analytical model of the system of interest. The expected variability of the output is then found by using a method like the [[propagation of error]] or functions of random variables.&lt;ref name="ProbDesign"&gt;See the 'Probabilistic Design' link in the external links for more information.&lt;/ref&gt; These typically produce an algebraic expression that can be analysed for optimisation and robustification. This approach is only as accurate as the model developed and it can be very difficult if not impossible for complex systems. 

The analytical approach might also be used in conjunction with some kind of surrogate model that is based on the results of experiments or numerical simulations of the system.

===Numerical===
In the numerical approach a model is run a number of times as part of a [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo simulation]] or a numerical propagation of errors to predict the variability of the outputs. Numerical optimisation methods such as hill climbing or evolutionary algorithms are then used to find the optimum nominal values for the inputs. This approach typically requires less human time and effort than the other two, but it can be very demanding on computational resources during simulation and optimization.

[[File:Nuclear reactor in dimona (israel).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center as viewed from a [[Corona (satellite)|Corona satellite]] in the late 1960s]]
The '''Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center''' ({{lang-he|קריה למחקר גרעיני – נגב צ"ש שמעון פרס}}, formerly the ''Negev Nuclear Research Center'', unofficially sometimes referred to as the ''Dimona reactor'') is an [[Israel]]i [[nuclear power|nuclear]] installation located in the [[Negev]] [[desert]], about thirteen kilometers south-east of the city of [[Dimona]]. In August 2018, it was renamed after the late [[President of Israel|President]] and [[Prime Minister of Israel]], and [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Shimon Peres]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofisrael.com/at-nuclear-facility-netanyahu-lobs-stark-warning-at-iran/ At nuclear facility, Netanyahu lobs stark warning at Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the facility began in 1958 and its [[heavy-water]] [[nuclear reactor]] went active sometime between 1962-1964. Israel claims that the nuclear reactor and research facility is for research purposes into atomic science.{{sfn|Nuclear Research Center}} However, the purpose of the reactor is believed to be the production of nuclear materials that may be used in [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israel's nuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|William|2013}} Information about the facility remains highly [[classified information|classified]] and with respect to nuclear weapons the country maintains a policy known as [[Policy of deliberate ambiguity|nuclear ambiguity]]—refusing either to confirm or deny their possession. Israel had produced its first nuclear weapons by 1967 and it has been estimated to possess anywhere between 80-400 nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Cohen|2010|pp = xxvii, 82}}

The airspace over the Dimona facility is closed to all aircraft, and the area around it is heavily guarded and fenced off. During the [[Six-Day War]], an Israeli missile shot down an Israeli Air Force [[Dassault Ouragan]] fighter that inadvertently flew over Dimona.{{sfn|Mahnaimi|2007}}{{sfn|Time|1976}}

Construction commenced in 1958, with [[France|French]] assistance according to the [[Protocol of Sèvres]] agreements.{{sfn|Fox News|2001}} The complex was constructed in secret, and outside the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] inspection regime.{{sfn|Ben-Gedalyahu|2013}} To maintain secrecy, French customs officials were told that the largest of the [[Nuclear reactor|reactor]] components, such as the reactor tank, were part of a [[desalination plant]] bound for Latin America.{{sfn|Aftergood, Kristensen|2007}} Estimates of the cost of construction vary; the only reliable figure is from [[Shimon Peres]], who wrote in his 1995 memoir that he and [[David Ben-Gurion]] collected US $40 million, "half the price of a reactor ... [from] Israel's friends around the world."{{sfn|Pinkus|2002}}

The Dimona reactor became [[criticality (status)|critical]] sometime between 1962 and 1964, and with the [[plutonium]] produced there the [[Israel Defense Forces]] most probably had their first nuclear weapons ready before the Six-Day War.

=== Inspections ===
When the [[United States]] intelligence community discovered the purpose of the site in the early 1960s, the U.S. government demanded that Israel agree to international inspections. Israel agreed, but on the condition that U.S., rather than [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], inspectors be used, and that Israel would receive advance notice of all inspections. Israel is one of three nations not to have signed the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|NPT]] (others are [[India and weapons of mass destruction|India]] and [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|Pakistan]], both of which have acknowledged having nuclear weapons), and alongside [[North Korea]] which left the NPT.{{sfn|UN|2005}}

Some claim that because Israel knew the schedule of the inspectors' visits, it was able to hide the illegal manufacture of nuclear weapons, thereby deceiving the inspectors, by installing temporary false walls and other devices before each inspection.{{sfn|Kintner}} The inspectors eventually informed the U.S. government that their inspections were useless, due to Israeli restrictions on what areas of the facility they could inspect. By 1969 the U.S. believed that Israel might have a nuclear weapon,{{sfn|Burr|2006}} and terminated inspections that year.

=== Jet aircraft take-down ===
The Dimona reactor was overflown by unidentified jet aircraft before the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. These planes were thought at the time to be [[Egyptian Air Force]] [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]]s, although a controversial 2007 book argues that they were actually [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|Soviet MiG-25s]].{{sfn|Ginor, Remez|2007}} During the war, an Israeli fighter jet damaged in a bombing raid over Jordan was shot down by air defenses protecting the reactor after straying over it, killing the pilot, Captain Yoram Harpaz.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-how-israel-s-nuclear-reactor-was-covered-up-1.5351217&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nuclear weapons production ===

The full-scale production of nuclear warheads is believed to have commenced by 1966, with the [[Israel Defense Forces]] believed to be in possession of up to 13 operational nuclear warheads by 1967.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'', April 12, 1976, quoted in Weissman and Krosney, op. cit., 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mordechai Vanunu revelations ===
[[File:Vanunu-glove-box-bomb-components.jpg|thumb|Vanunu's photograph of a Negev Nuclear Research Center glove box containing nuclear materials in a model bomb assembly, one of about 60 photographs he later gave to the British press.]]
In 1986, [[Mordechai Vanunu]], a former technician at Dimona, fled to the [[United Kingdom]] and revealed to the media some evidence of Israel's nuclear program and explained the purposes of each building, also revealing a top-secret underground facility directly below the installation. The [[Mossad]], Israel's secret service, sent a female agent named [[Cheryl Bentov]] (née Hanin) who lured Vanunu to [[Italy]], where he was kidnapped by Mossad agents and smuggled to Israel aboard a freighter. An Israeli court then tried him in secret on charges of [[treason]] and [[espionage]], and sentenced him to eighteen years imprisonment. At the time of Vanunu's kidnapping, ''[[The Times]]'' reported that Israel had material for approximately 20 [[hydrogen bombs]] and 200 [[fission bomb]]s by 1986. In the spring of 2004, Vanunu was released from prison, and placed under several strict restrictions, such as the denial of a passport, freedom of movement limitations and restrictions on communications with the press. Since his release, he has been rearrested and charged multiple times for violations of the terms of his release.{{sfn|Timms|2004}}{{sfn|AFP|2015}}

=== Safety concerns ===
Safety concerns about the 55+ year-old reactor have been reported. In 2004, as a preventive measure, Israeli authorities distributed [[potassium iodide]] anti-radiation tablets to thousands of residents living nearby.{{sfn|AFP|2004}}

In 2006 a group of local residents was formed{{Who|date=January 2012}} due to concerns regarding serious threats to health and safety from living near the reactor.

==== Human experimentation ====
According to a lawsuit filed in Be'er Sheva Labor Tribunal, workers at the center were subjected to [[Human subject research|human experimentation]] in 1998. According to Julius Malick, the worker who submitted the lawsuit, they were given drinks containing [[uranium]] without medical supervision and without obtaining written consent or warning them about risks of side effects.{{sfn|Melman|2009}}
The lawsuit was rejected by the court and the worker's claims were dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=גולן |first1=גדי |title=נדחתה תביעת עובד הכור שטען: "אולצתי לשתות אורניום" |url=https://www.israelhayom.co.il/article/130169 |accessdate=20 November 2018 |work=ישראל היום |date=6 November 2013 |language=he}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Attacks ====
In January 2012, media reports indicated that the [[Israel Atomic Energy Commission]] had decided to temporarily shut down the reactor. The site's vulnerability to attack from Iran was cited as the main reason for the decision.{{sfn|Mahnaimi|2012}} In October and November 2012, it was reported that [[Hamas]] had fired rockets at Dimona and/or Negev Nuclear Research Center.{{sfn|Debka|2012}}{{sfn|Arutz Sheva|2012}} In July 2014 Hamas again fired rockets towards the area surrounding the reactor. The facility was not harmed or damaged in any of the attempted strikes.{{sfn|Big News Network|2014}}

=== Declassified documents ===
In April 2016  the U.S. [[National Security Archive]] declassified dozens of documents from 1960 to 1970, which detail what American intelligence viewed as Israel’s attempts to obfuscate the purpose and details of its nuclear program. The Americans involved in discussions with Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] and other Israelis believed the country was providing “untruthful cover” about intentions to build nuclear weapons.{{sfn|Adaret|2016}}

== Conspiracy theories ==

=== John F. Kennedy ===
In 2004, Mordechai Vanunu stated that the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] was Israel's response to "pressure [Kennedy] exerted on...Ben-Gurion, to shed light on Dimona's nuclear reactor in Israel".{{sfn|SMH|2004}} The [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] claimed during a [[United Nations]] General Assembly speech in 2009 that [[Israel]] had ordered the killing of [[John F. Kennedy|President John F. Kennedy]] because Kennedy had wanted to investigate the Negev Nuclear Plant.{{sfn|JTA|2009}}{{sfn|Lynfield|2011|p=}}

'''Solemyidae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of saltwater clams, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] protobranch [[bivalve]] [[mollusk]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Solemyoida]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur William Baden Powell|Powell A. W. B.]], ''New Zealand Mollusca'', [[HarperCollins|William Collins Publishers Ltd]], Auckland, New Zealand (1979) {{ISBN|0-00-216906-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
Solemyids are remarkable in that their digestive tract is either extremely small or non-existent, and their feeding appendages are too short to reach outside the shell.&lt;ref&gt;Reid R. G. B. (1989) The unwhole organism. [http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/3/1133/ American Zoologist 29:1133-1140]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that these clams host [[sulphur]]-[[oxidizing]] [[bacteria]] intracellularly within their [[gill]] filaments. As [[chemoautotrophs]], these bacterial [[symbionts]] synthesize organic matter from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and are the primary source of nutrition for the whole organism.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanaugh C. M., Abbott M. S., Veenhuis M. (1988) Immunochemical localization of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase in the symbiont-containing gills of Solemya velum (Bivalvia, Mollusca). [http://www.pnas.org/content/85/20/7786 PNAS 85:7786–7789]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart F. J., Cavanaugh, C. M. (2006) Bacterial endosymbioses in Solemya (Mollusca: Bivalvia) – Model systems for studies of symbiont-host adaptation. [http://springerlink.com/content/e24615311h534725/ Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 90: 343-360] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130202220900/http://springerlink.com/content/e24615311h534725/ |date=2013-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the animal host provides its symbionts a habitat in which they have access to the substrates of chemoautotrophy (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduced inorganic compounds such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Together, these partners create "animals" with novel metabolic capabilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6588">[[File:Ex_sq.png|right|320px|thumb|Some superquadrics.]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''superquadrics''' or '''super-quadrics''' (also '''superquadratics''')  are a family of [[geometry|geometric shapes]] defined by formulas that resemble those of [[ellipsoid]]s and other [[quadric]]s, except that the [[square (algebra)|squaring]] operations are replaced by arbitrary powers. They can be seen as the three-dimensional relatives of the [[superellipse]]s. The term may refer to the solid object or to its [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]], depending on the context. The equations below specify the surface; the solid is specified by replacing the equality signs by less-than-or-equal signs.

The superquadrics include many shapes that resemble [[cube]]s, [[octahedron|octahedra]], [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinders]], [[lozenge]]s and [[spindle torus|spindle]]s, with rounded or sharp corners. Because of their flexibility and relative simplicity, they are popular [[geometric model]]ing tools, especially in [[computer graphics]]. 

Some authors, such as [[Alan H. Barr|Alan Barr]], define "superquadrics" as including both the [[superellipsoid]]s and the [[supertoroid]]s.&lt;ref name="barr81"&gt;Barr, A.H. (January 1981), ''Superquadrics and Angle-Preserving Transformations''. IEEE_CGA vol. 1 no. 1, pp. 11–23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barr92"&gt;Barr, A.H. (1992), ''Rigid Physically Based Superquadrics''. Chapter III.8 of ''Graphics Gems III'', edited by D. Kirk, pp. 137–159&lt;/ref&gt; However, the (proper) supertoroids are not superquadrics as defined above; and, while some superquadrics are superellipsoids, neither family is contained in the other.

== Formulas ==
=== Implicit equation ===
The surface of the basic superquadric is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \left|x\right|^r + \left|y\right|^s + \left|z\right|^t =1&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'', ''s'', and ''t'' are positive real numbers that determine the main features of the superquadric. Namely:

* less than 1: a pointy octahedron modified to have [[concave polygon|concave]] [[face (geometry)|faces]] and sharp [[edge (geometry)|edges]].
* exactly 1: a regular [[octahedron]].
* between 1 and 2: an octahedron modified to have convex faces, blunt edges and blunt corners.
* exactly 2: a sphere
* greater than 2: a cube modified to have rounded edges and corners.
* [[infinity (mathematics)|infinite]] (in the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]): a cube

Each exponent can be varied independently to obtain combined shapes. For example, if ''r''=''s''=2, and ''t''=4, one obtains a solid of revolution which resembles an ellipsoid with round cross-section but flattened ends. This formula is a special case of the superellipsoid's formula if (and only if) ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''s''.

If any exponent is allowed to be negative, the shape extends to infinity. Such shapes are sometimes called '''super-hyperboloids'''.

The basic shape above spans from -1 to +1 along each coordinate axis. The general superquadric is the result of [[similarity (geometry)|scaling]] this basic shape by different amounts ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' along each axis. Its general equation is
:&lt;math&gt; \left|\frac{x}{A}\right|^r + \left|\frac{y}{B}\right|^s + \left|\frac{z}{C}\right|^t = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Parametric description ===
Parametric equations in terms of surface parameters ''u'' and ''v'' (longitude and latitude) are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 x(u,v) &amp;{}= A g\left(v,\frac{2}{r}\right) g\left(u,\frac{2}{r}\right) \\
 y(u,v) &amp;{}= B g\left(v,\frac{2}{s}\right) f\left(u,\frac{2}{s}\right) \\
 z(u,v) &amp;{}= C f\left(v,\frac{2}{t}\right) \\
 &amp; -\frac{\pi}{2} \le v \le \frac{\pi}{2}, \quad -\pi \le u &lt; \pi ,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the auxiliary functions are
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f(\omega,m) &amp;{}= \sgn(\sin \omega) |\sin \omega|^m \\
 g(\omega,m) &amp;{}= \sgn(\cos \omega) |\cos \omega|^m
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and the [[sign function]] sgn(''x'') is 
:&lt;math&gt; \sgn(x) = \begin{cases}
 -1, &amp; x &lt; 0 \\
  0, &amp; x = 0 \\
 +1, &amp; x &gt; 0 .
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;!-- Fix this for superquadrics: 
==Properties==
===Volume and area===
The volume inside this surface can be expressed in terms of [[beta function]]s, β(''m'',''n'')&amp;nbsp;= Γ(''m'')Γ(''n'')/Γ(''m''+''n''), as
:&lt;math&gt; V = \frac{2}{3} A B C e n \beta \left( \frac{1}{r},\frac{1}{r} \right) \beta \left({2}{t},\frac{1}{t} \right) . &lt;/math&gt;

== Plots ==

--&gt;

== Plotting code ==

The following [[GNU Octave]] code generates a mesh approximation of a superquadric:
&lt;!-- Is this code worth including? The equation is enough! --&gt;
&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
 function retval=superquadric(epsilon,a)
  n=50;
  etamax=pi/2;
  etamin=-pi/2;
  wmax=pi;
  wmin=-pi;
  deta=(etamax-etamin)/n;
  dw=(wmax-wmin)/n;
  [i,j] = meshgrid(1:n+1,1:n+1)
  eta = etamin + (i-1) * deta;
  w   = wmin + (j-1) * dw;
  x = a(1) .* sign(cos(eta)) .* abs(cos(eta)).^epsilon(1) .* sign(cos(w)) .* abs(cos(w)).^epsilon(1);
  y = a(2) .* sign(cos(eta)) .* abs(cos(eta)).^epsilon(2) .* sign(sin(w)) .* abs(sin(w)).^epsilon(2);
  z = a(3) .* sign(sin(eta)) .* abs(sin(eta)).^epsilon(3);

  mesh(x,y,z);
  endfunction;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;!--The hyperboloid images generated by this code are not very good. --&gt;
&lt;!--
The following code plots superhyperboloids:

&lt;code&gt;
 function superhyper(epsilon,a)
  n=50;
  d=.1;
  etamax=pi/2-d;
  etamin=-pi/2+d;
  wmax=3*pi/2-d;
  wmin=pi/2+d;
  deta=(etamax-etamin)/n;
  dw=(wmax-wmin)/n;
  k=0;
  l=0;
  for i=1:n+1
    eta(i)=etamin+(i-1)*deta;
    for j=1:n+1
      w(j)=wmin+(j-1)*dw;
      x(i,j)=a(1)*sign(sec(eta(i)))*abs(sec(eta(i)))^epsilon(1)*sign(sec(w(j)))*abs(sec(w(j)))^epsilon(2);
      y(i,j)=a(2)*sign(sec(eta(i)))*abs(sec(eta(i)))^epsilon(1)*sign(tan(w(j)))*abs(tan(w(j)))^epsilon(2);
      z(i,j)=a(3)*sign(tan(eta(i)))*abs(tan(eta(i)))^epsilon(1);
    endfor;
  endfor;
   mesh(x,y,z);
 endfunction;
&lt;/code&gt;

In terms of form, techno-globalism can be expressed in macro and micro scales ranging from the interconnections of [[Economy|national economies]] to individual behavioral culture.

== Origins and background ==
Techno-globalism as a social theory emerged in the late 1990s following the end of the [[Cold War]]. During the Cold War, technology, especially [[military technology]], acted as a separating force between the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniele|first=Archibugi,|last2=Jonathan|first2=Michie,|date=|title=The globalisation of technology: a new taxonomy|url=https://academic.oup.com/cje/article-abstract/19/1/121/1708275?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Cambridge Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.cje.a035299|issn=1464-3545}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear arms race]] and the [[space race]] are examples of the tension between the two superpowers created by science and technology. As a result, political and social theorists on globalization saw technology as a symbol of [[nationalism]] which many theorized as [[Technological nationalism|techno-nationalism]]. However, following the Cold War, global initiatives on cooperation in scientific research and technology development shed new light on the role that science and technology can play in globalization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Massive science projects often require co-funding of different nations and, more importantly, the sharing of knowledge among different nations. These projects signal a shift from technology as competition to technology as cooperation. Techno-globalism further permeates the globe by going beyond national scale and into the realm of individual behavior. [[Consumerism]] in the 21st century led to the widespread consumption of technology products that created common behavioral and cultural patterns among individuals around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rise of the [[internet]], [[smartphone]]s and [[social media]] around the world create common values and behavioral patterns in people who have different national backgrounds. This trend of globalization on an individual level is supported by techno-globalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44953782|title=Techno-nationalism and techno-globalism : conflict and cooperation|last=Sylvia.|first=Ostry,|date=1995|publisher=Brookings Institution|others=Nelson, Richard R.|isbn=0585179506|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=44953782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of techno-globalism on a national scale ==
Examples of techno-globalism can be found in the joint efforts of nations pursuing scientific knowledge or realizing ambitious engineering projects. Large-scale scientific research and engineering projects often require fundings and manpower beyond the capacity of a single nation. As such, nations are brought together under the common goal of science and technology which affirms techno-globalism.

The [[International Space Station]] is a low-orbit space project made possible by the cooperation of 15 countries. The first part of the space station was launched into space in 1998 and other parts of the space station followed. Since the space station is made up of individual parts, each country utilizes its strength to build one part and the parts are finally assembled in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/overview/index.html|title=International Space Station Overview|last=Garcia|first=Mark|date=2016-04-28|work=NASA|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that respect, the International Space Station is an embodiment of techno-globalism where nations share resources and information to achieve a common goal.[[File:ISS March 2009.jpg|thumb|The International Space Station. A joint effort of fifteen countries to establish a space platform for research and exploration.|217x217px]]

The [[Large Hadron Collider]] is another example of techno-globalism at a national scale. The LHC is the world's largest and most powerful particle accelerator and was built under the cooperation of more than 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider|title=The Large Hadron Collider {{!}} CERN|website=home.cern|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, both the construction and the utilization of the facility represent techno-globalism.

Techno-globalism can impact the behaviors and values of individuals through the use of technology in people's daily lives.

The [[MacBook Pro]] is a prime example of techno-globalism from a consumer standpoint. Due to the wild{{peacock term|date=July 2018}} success of the MacBook Pro around the globe, the unibody case design and the aesthetics of the MacBook Pro is highly valued{{according to whom|date=July 2018}} in the countries where it is sold.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} It is surprising{{according to whom|date=July 2018}} that China and the U.S, for instance, two countries with drastically different cultures and art tastes have all come to appreciate the engineering of this piece of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70668758|title=IWoz : computer geek to cult icon : how I invented the personal computer, co-founded Apple, and had fun doing it|last=1950-|first=Wozniak, Steve,|date=2006|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|others=Smith, Gina.|isbn=0393061434|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=70668758}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The example of the MacBook Pro goes to show the common values created by technology among individuals that use it despite their diverse cultural backgrounds.

== The impact of techno-globalism on science ==
Despite the many benefits that techno-globalism brings in terms of resources and cooperations, techno-globalism can pose certain challenges to the way that people deal with technology.{{clarify|date=July 2018}} Many existing policies regarding science and technology are inadequate to handle the fast-paced dynamics of techno-globalism due to their slow responses.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de la Mothe|first=John|last2=Dufour|first2=Paul R.|date=1995|title=Techno-Globalism and the Challenges to Science and Technology Policy|jstor=20027317|journal=Daedalus|volume=124|issue=3|pages=219–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the corresponding political infrastructure, techno-globalism would bring chaos into the field of science and technology since people would be trying to integrate parts of science inappropriately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the other hand, techno-globalism could facilitate standardization in the science community. In the case of the LHC, scientists working at the LHC have the opportunity to work under a common setting which allows for better communication and integration of their academic works.

There are several theaters in the kingdom. The Theater of King Fahd Cultural Center in Riyadh is considered the largest theater in Saudi Arabia with the largest number of seats that serve more than 3000 people. It has witnessed and hosted many theatre activities. Also, the theater of King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture has around 900 seats, and plan to open in the second half of 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Theater|url=http://en.kingabdulazizcenter.com/node/526#.WD0v5_krJPY|website=kingabdulazizcenter|publisher=kingabdulazizcenter|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tidal heating''' (also known as '''tidal working''' or '''tidal flexing''') occurs through the [[tidal friction]] processes: orbital energy is dissipated as heat in either the surface ocean or interior of a planet or satellite.  When an object is in an [[elliptic orbit|elliptical orbit]], the [[tidal force]]s acting on it are stronger near [[apsis|periapsis]] than
near apoapsis. Thus the deformation of the body due to tidal forces (i.e. the tidal bulge) varies over the course of its orbit, generating internal friction which heats its interior. This energy gained by the object comes from its [[gravitational energy]], so over time in a two-body system, the initial elliptical orbit decays into a circular orbit ([[tidal circularization]]). Sustained tidal heating occurs when the elliptical orbit is prevented from circularizing due to additional gravitational forces that keep tugging the object back into an elliptical orbit. In this more complex system, gravitational energy still is being converted to thermal energy; however, now the orbit's semi-major axis shrinks rather than its eccentricity.

Tidal heating is responsible for the most volcanically active body in the [[solar system]]: [[Io (moon)|Io]], a moon of [[Jupiter]]. Io's eccentricity persists as the result of its [[orbital resonance]]s with the other [[Galilean moons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Saturn's moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] is similarly thought to have a liquid water ocean beneath its icy crust due to tidal heating. The [[cryovolcano|water vapor geysers]] which eject material from Enceladus are thought to be powered by friction generated within this moon's shifting ice crust.&lt;ref&gt;Peale, S.J.

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{E}_\text{Tidal} = -\text{Im}(k_{2})\frac{21}{2}\frac{R^{5}n^{5}e^{2}}{G}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; are respectively the satellite's mean radius, [[mean motion|mean orbital motion]], and eccentricity.&lt;ref&gt;Segatz, M., T.

This imaginary portion is a function of the satellite's bulk shear modulus and viscosity. These in turn are dependent upon temperature and melting of the satellite's interior.&lt;ref&gt;Efroimsky, Michael. 2012. “Tidal Dissipation Compared to Seismic Dissipation: In Small Bodies, in Earths, and in Superearths.” The Astrophysical Journal 746: 150–86. doi:10.1088/0004-637X/746/2/150.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Van Andel Institute''' '''(VAI)''' is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit [[medical research|biomedical research]] and science education organization in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]]. VAI was founded by [[Jay Van Andel|Jay]] and Betty Van Andel in 1996 and  comprises four divisions: Van Andel Research Institute (VARI), Van Andel Education Institute (VAEI), Van Andel Institute Graduate School (VAIGS), and Purple Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = West Michigan Science &amp; Technology Initiative |title=Van Andel Institute |url= http://showcase.wmsti.org/vanandelinstitutespon.htm |accessdate = November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute's research focuses on [[cancer epigenetics]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. Its educational efforts support teacher development and science education from early elementary through the doctoral level.

David Van Andel, son of Jay and Betty, has served as CEO and chairman of the board since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/vanandelinstitute9/docs/final_20th_ann._highlights_of_hope_|title=Highlights of Hope 20th Anniversary Edition|work=issuu|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Vienna Institute of Demography (VID)''' (until 2002: Institut für Demographie/IfD) is a research institute of the division for humanities and social sciences within the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] (ÖAW)&lt;ref&gt;[http://wissenschaft.bmwfw.gv.at/fileadmin/user_upload/forschung/OEAW-Forschungsinstitute_Feb._2015.pdf List of Academy institutes published by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; and part of the three "''pillar institutions''" of the [[Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1295571237693/Ehrgeizig-Wiener-Wittgenstein-Center-will-an-Spitze-der-Demographie-Institute ''Der Standard'', 31. January 2011: "Vienna Wittgenstein Centre aims for top position among demography institutes worldwide" (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

After some groundwork by researchers interested in having a population studies institute in Austria, among them [[Wilhelm Winkler]] and Gustav Feichtinger, the ''Institut für Demographie'' was established in November 1975 as a non-university research institute of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in close cooperation with the Austrian Statistical Central Office (now [[Statistik Austria]]). Founding director was Lothar Bosse (1914–1996), a German-born philosopher, mathematician and economist who remained at the head of IfD for twelve years. In the first few years, research activities were limited by budget restrictions and focussed on ''theory and basic research'' as well as ''applied demography''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/29734814 ''European Demographic Information Bulletin'' (December 1979), Volume 10, Issue 4, pp. 163–164]&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning, there was an emphasis on informing the public about population issues and research results, by publications such as "''Demographische Informationen''" (since 1981, in German with English abstracts).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/16/035/16035469.pdf Activity Report of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, chapter on IfD on p.222ff. (published in the IAEA archive)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosse was succeeded by [[Richard Gisser]] who headed the institute 1987–1989 and again 1993–2001 (interim directorship was taken by social scientist Rainer Münz) and continues to be the institute’s deputy director and a leader of the research group on ''Demography of Austria''.

In the period of 1985 to 2000, the institute and the research topic of demography received increasing attention, though there was some competition for scientific staff with the newly founded [[Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research]] in Rostock, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23026758 "Twenty Years Institute of Demography: Activities 1987–1996", in: ''Demographische Informationen'' (1995/96), pp. 5-8 (JSTOR quotation)]&lt;/ref&gt;

After positive independent evaluations and the commitment of special funds, the ÖAW decided to substantially expand and internationalise the institute in 2001. Under the designated new director [[Wolfgang Lutz]], the IfD changed its name and working language, employed more scientific and administrative staff, expanded its research agenda as well as its publication efforts and moved to new and successively larger premises in the 4th district (2002–2007 at Prinz-Eugen-Strasse 8-10, then 2007–2015 at Wohllebengasse 12-14).

Research activity at VID continued to expand and received favourable attention by policy-makers and scientific peers, which showed in VID members participating in or coordinating major research projects, for instance within the European Union’s [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Framework Programmes]], and obtaining recognition by being awarded sizeable grants from the [[European Research Council]] (ERC). Director Wolfgang Lutz received the [[Wittgenstein Award]] in 2010 and, with the 1.5 million euro prize money, established the ''Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital''.

At its 40th anniversary in 2015, VID moved to the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business|WU]] campus in Vienna’s 2nd district,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wu.ac.at/en/press/press-releases/press-releases-details/detail/wu-welcomes-the-austrian-academy-of-sciences-to-its-new-department-building-5/|title=WU welcomes the Austrian Academy of Sciences to its new Department Building 5|work=WU (Vienna University of Economics and Business)|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrating this and other occasions with a symposium on "Demography that Matters".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tt.com/home/10463868-91/multiple-jubil%C3%A4en-f%C3%BCr-wiener-demographie.csp ''Tiroler Tageszeitung'' of 4 September 2015: "Multiple anniversaries for Vienna’s Demography"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dstatg.de/en/home/aktuelle-news/article/40-years-vienna-institute-of-demography-symposium-demography-that-matters/ Announcement by the German Statistical Society (DStatG)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 Alexia Fürnkranz-Prskawetz, head of the Institute of Mathematical Methods in Economics at the [[Vienna University of Technology]] and long-time leader of the VID research group on ''Population Economics'' became executive director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/vid/people/staff/#c11970 Academy entry about VID, giving the current directorships]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="40years"&gt;[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/fileadmin/NEWS/2015/PDF/VID_40years.pdf Details on the VID history taken from the anniversary brochure ''40 years of the Vienna Institute of Demography 1975–2015'', Vienna, 2015, Wittgenstein Centre, VID, ÖAW]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research activities ==

VID employs about 40 researchers, most of them from the fields of [[economics]], [[mathematics]]/[[statistics]], [[geography]], health studies and [[sociology]], to cover the major research topics of [[demography]] or population science: [[fertility]], [[mortality rate|mortality]] and [[human migration|migration]] as well as a number of other fields of interest. Over time, the institute’s research focus has expanded from its core competences in Austrian and later European demography to a global perspective on the relevant issues of population and human capital development.&lt;ref name="40years" /&gt;

There are seven main areas of research, assigned to different research groups though there is considerable permeability and cooperation:

* Demography of Austria (led by Richard Gisser and Isabella Buber-Ennser)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ggp-austria.at/fileadmin/ggp-austria/Publikationen/ggp_brochure_austria_2013_english.pdf ''Families in Austria'', results of the Generations and Gender Survey 2009–2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Comparative European Demography (Tomáš Sobotka)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A demographic explanation for the recent rise in European fertility. |journal=[[Population and Development Review]] |volume=38 | issue = 1  |pages=83–120 |year=2012 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00473.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00473.x/abstract |author=Bongaarts, John |last2=Sobotka |first2=Tomáš}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Population Dynamics and Forecasting ([[Sergei Scherbov]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Remeasuring Aging. |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=329 |issue=5997 |pages=1287–1288 |year=2010 |doi=10.1126/science.1193647 |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/content/329/5997/1287.full |author=Sanderson, W.C. |last2=Scherbov |first2=S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Population Economics (Michael Kuhn and Gustav Feichtinger)
* Health and Longevity (Marc Luy)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cloisterstudy.eu ''The Cloister Study'', a longitudinal study on longevity among monks and nuns]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Migration and Education (Jesús Crespo Cuaresma)
* Human Capital Data Lab (Anne Goujon)

== Publications ==

In addition to the individual contributions of VID researchers to a number of scientific journals,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., {{cite journal|title=Universal education is key to enhanced climate adaptation.|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=346 |issue=6213 |pages=1061–1062 |year=2014  |doi=10.1126/science.1257975  |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6213/1061|author=Lutz, W.|last2=Muttarak|first2=R.| last3=Striessnig|first3=W. |pmid=25430758}}, {{cite journal|title=Average remaining lifetimes can increase as human populations age. |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=435 |pages=811–813 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/nature03593 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7043/abs/nature03593.html |author=Sanderson, W.C. |last2=Scherbov |first2=S. |pmid=15944703}}&lt;/ref&gt; the institute issues the following regular publications:

* ''Vienna Yearbook of Population Research'' (VYPR)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/journal/vienyearpopurese JSTOR entry for VYPR]&lt;/ref&gt;—since 2003, the "Yearbook" features peer-reviewed research articles (in English) addressing population trends as well as a broad range of theoretical and methodological issues in population research, usually taking the form of the [[proceedings]] of last year’s VID/Wittgenstein conference, which is always dedicated to a particular demographic topic. Besides that, the VYPR also publishes Demographic Debates with invited contributions on topics related to the ongoing scientific arguments in the field. Finally, contributions on Data &amp; Trends map long-term developments as well as recent trends in various components of population change in Austria and in Europe.
* ''Demografische Forschung aus erster Hand''—a newsletter in German language (in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research), for information of journalists and policymakers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, approx. four times a year&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/news_press/press_releases_1916/research_strengthens_public_dialogue_the_max_planck_institute_for_demographic_research_rostock_and_1059.htm Press release by MPDR, 26 March 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''VID Working Papers''—occasional articles in English, mostly by VID researchers
* ''Forschungsberichte'' (Research Reports)—occasional articles, mostly in German and also usually by VID researchers
* ''European Demographic Data Sheet''—every other year, VID presents the relevant data on a selected topic (such as ageing, migration, fertility etc.) on an A1-size poster with maps and figures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/News/160831-EDS.html|title=European Demographic Data Sheet 2016 - News 2016 - IIASA|website=www.iiasa.ac.at|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
