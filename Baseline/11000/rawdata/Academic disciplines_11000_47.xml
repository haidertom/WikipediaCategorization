The '''argument from religious experience''' is an argument for the [[existence of God]]&lt;!--[Why only materialism?:], as against [[materialism]]--&gt;. It holds that the best explanation for [[religious experiences]] is that they constitute genuine experience or perception of a divine reality. Various reasons have been offered for and against accepting this contention.

Contemporary defenders of the argument are [[Alister Hardy]] and [[Dinesh D'Souza]].

== Outline ==

In essence, the argument's structure is as follows:{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
# There are compelling reasons for believing that claims of [[religious experience]] point to and validate [[Supernatural|spiritual realities]] that exist in a way that [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] material manifestation;
# According to [[materialism]], nothing exists in a way that transcends material manifestation;
# According to [[classical theism]]&lt;!-- (and many theistic faiths)--&gt;, God endows human beings with the ability to perceive –&amp;nbsp;although imperfectly&amp;nbsp;– religious, spiritual and/or transcendent realities through religious, spiritual and/or transcendent experience.
# To the extent that premise 1. is accepted, therefore, [[theism]] is more plausible than materialism.

As statements 2 to 4 are generally treated as uncontroversial,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} discussion has tended to focus on the status of the first.

===Suggested reasons for accepting the premise===
Some principal arguments that have been made in favor of the premise include:
*Very substantial numbers of ordinary people report having had such experiences, though this isn't to say that religious believers aren't ordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne ''Belief in God in an Age of Science' "the surveys conducted by the distinguished biologist [[Alister Hardy]]"Swinburne references David Hay ''Religious Experience Today'' (1990) chapters 5, 6 and Appendix&lt;/ref&gt; Such experiences are reported in almost all known cultures.
*These experiences often have very significant effects on people's lives, frequently inducing in them acts of extreme self-sacrifice well beyond what could be expected from evolutionary arguments.
*These experiences often seem very real to the people involved, and are quite often reported as being shared by a number of people.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [[New Testament]] speaks of Jesus, after his resurrection, appearing to 10 or more people at once (see e.g. 1 Corinthians 15:6, Luke 24, Mt 28, Jn 16, Acts 1).&lt;/ref&gt; Although mass delusions are not inconceivable, one needs compelling reasons for invoking this as an explanation.
*[[Richard Swinburne|Swinburne]] suggests that, as two basic principles of rationality, we ought to believe that things are as they seem unless and until we have evidence that they are mistaken (principle of credulity), and that those who do not have an experience of a certain type ought to believe others who say that they do in the absence of evidence of deceit or delusion (principle of testimony) and thus, although if you have a ''strong'' reason to disbelieve in the existence of God you will discount these experiences, in other cases such evidence should count towards the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, ''Is there a God?'' p 133–136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggested reasons for disputing the premise===
On the other hand, the following reasons have been offered for rejecting the premise:
* These might be mis-firings of evolved mechanisms selected for very different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;This is broadly Dawkins' line in [[The God Delusion]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Religious texts such as the Bible that speak of revelations are of disputable historical accuracy.&lt;ref name="Facts"&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker |first=Cliff |title=Is The Bible Historically Accurate? |publisher=Positive Atheism |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/mail/eml9823.htm |accessdate=11 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613135307/http://positiveatheism.org/mail/eml9823.htm |archivedate=13 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is conceivable that some claimed religious experiences are lies, possibly done for attention or acceptance.&lt;ref name="Facts"/&gt;
* [[Argument from inconsistent revelations]]: Different people have had, or believed to have had, religious experiences pointing to the existence of different religions. Not all of these can be correct.  Kraemer highlighted a link between arguments of religious experience and self-righteousness (perception of superiority over those who do not receive providence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Christian Message in a Non-Christian World|first=Hendrik|last=Kraemer|year=2009|publisher=Centre for Contemporary Christianity|isbn=8190869108|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* It has been argued that religious experiences are little more than hallucinations aimed at fulfilling basic psychological desires of immortality, purpose, etc. [[Sigmund Freud]], for example, considered God to be simply a psychological "illusion"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund, ''The Future of an Illusion'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, {{ISBN|0-393-00831-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; created by the mind, instead of an actual existing entity. This argument can be based upon the fact that since we know about some believers for whom this argument is correct (their reports for religious experiences are nothing more than illusions), we assume that perhaps all such reports may be illusions.

== Alternate formulations ==

American analytic philosophers [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[William Alston]] developed arguments for accepting knowledge gained from religious experience based on drawing analogies with knowledge gained from [[sense experience]].&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Webb|first=Mark|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-link=Edward Zalta|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|title=Religious experience|year=2017|publisher=|location=|isbn=|pages=|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religious-experience/|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases they apply their arguments to Christian religious experiences, but accept that they may equally apply to other religious experiences.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

Plantinga argues that just as the knowledge gained from sense experience is regarded as [[Basic belief|properly basic]] despite being unsupported based on [[foundationalism]] in the mould of [[Descartes]], religious experiences should be accepted as providing properly basic knowledge of God.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

Alston argues that if sets of practices used to form beliefs produce conclusions that are coherent over time both internally and with other belief-forming practices, they should be accepted. He argues this is the only way our ordinary beliefs are justified, and that by the same criteria belief based on Christian religious experience is justified.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

An '''artificial cell''' or '''minimal cell''' is an engineered particle that mimics one or many functions of a [[Cell (biology)|biological cell]]. The term does not refer to a specific physical entity, but rather to the idea that certain functions or structures of biological cells can be replaced or supplemented with a synthetic entity. Often, artificial cells are biological or polymeric membranes which enclose biologically active materials. As such, [[nanoparticle]]s, [[liposome]]s, [[polymersome]]s, microcapsules and a number of other particles have qualified as artificial cells. [[Micro-encapsulation]] allows for [[metabolism]] within the membrane, exchange of small molecules and prevention of passage of large substances across it.&lt;ref name="Chang 2007"&gt;{{cite book | last=Chang | first=Thomas Ming Swi | title=Artificial cells : biotechnology, nanomedicine, regenerative medicine, blood substitutes, bioencapsulation, cell/stem cell therapy | year=2007 | publisher=World Scientific | location=Hackensack, N.J. | isbn=981-270-576-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prakash" /&gt; The main advantages of encapsulation include improved mimicry in the body, increased [[solubility]] of the cargo and decreased [[immune system|immune responses]]. Notably, artificial cells have been clinically successful in [[hemoperfusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Charles G. | last=Gebelein | title=Polymeric materials and artificial organs based on a symposium sponsored by the Division of Organic Coatings and Plastics Chemistry at the 185th Meeting of the American Chemical Society | year=1983 | publisher=American Chemical Society | location=Washington, D.C. | isbn=978-0-8412-1084-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of [[synthetic biology]], a "living" artificial cell has been defined as a completely synthetically made cell that can capture [[energy]], maintain [[electrochemical gradient|ion gradients]], contain [[macromolecule]]s as well as store information and have the ability to [[mutate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Deamer | first=D | title=A giant step towards artificial life? | journal=Trends in Biotechnology | date=July 2005 | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=336–8 | pmid=15935500 | doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2005.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a cell is not technically feasible yet, but a variation of an artificial cell has been created in which a completely synthetic [[genome]] was introduced to genomically emptied host cells.&lt;ref name="gibson52"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gibson | first=D.

==History==
The first artificial cells were developed by [[Thomas Chang]] at [[McGill University]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Chang | first=TM | title=Semipermeable microscapsules. | journal=Science | year=1964 | volume=146 | issue = 3643 | pages=524–525 | doi=10.1126/science.146.3643.524 | pmid=14190240}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cells consisted of ultrathin membranes of nylon, collodion or crosslinked protein whose [[semipermeable]] properties allowed [[diffusion]] of small molecules in and out of the cell. These cells were micron-sized and contained  [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[enzymes]], [[hemoglobin]], magnetic materials, [[adsorption|adsorbents]] and [[proteins]].&lt;ref name="Chang 2007" /&gt;

Later artificial cells have ranged from hundred-micrometer to nanometer dimensions and can carry microorganisms, [[vaccines]], [[genes]], drugs, [[hormones]] and [[peptides]].&lt;ref name="Chang 2007" /&gt; The first clinical use of artificial cells was in [[hemoperfusion]] by the encapsulation of [[activated charcoal]].&lt;ref name="Chang 1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Chang | first=T.M.S | title=Editorial: past, present and future perspectives on the 40th anniversary of hemoglobin based red blood cell substitutes | journal=Artificial Cells Blood Substit Immobil Biotechnol | year=1996 | volume=24 | pages=ixxxvi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, researchers were able to introduce enzymes, proteins and hormones to biodegradable microcapsules, later leading to clinical use in diseases such as [[Lesch-Nyhan syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Palmour | first=RM | last2=Goodyer | first2=P | last3=Reade | first3=T | last4=Chang | first4=TM | title=Microencapsulated xanthine oxidase as experimental therapy in Lesch-Nyhan disease. | journal=Lancet | date=16 September 1989 | volume=2 | issue=8664 | pages=687–8 | pmid=2570944 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(89)90939-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Chang's initial research focused on artificial [[red blood cells]], only in the mid-1990s were biodegradable artificial red blood cells developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chang | first=Thomas Ming | title=Blood substitutes | year=1997 | publisher=Karger | location=Basel | isbn=3-8055-6584-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Artificial cells in biological cell encapsulation were first used in the clinic in 1994 for treatment in a diabetic patient&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Soon-Shiong | first=P. | last2=Heintz | first2=R.E. | last3=Merideth | first3=N. | last4=Yao | first4=Q.X. | last5=Yao | first5=Z. | last6=Zheng | first6=T. | last7=Murphy | first7=M. | last8=Moloney | first8=M.K. | last9=Schmehl | first9=M. | last10=Harris | first10=M. | last11=Mendez | first11=R. | last12=Mendez | first12=R. | last13=Sandford | first13=P.A. | title=Insulin independence in a type 1 diabetic patient after encapsulated islet transplantation | journal=The Lancet | date=1 April 1994 | volume=343 | issue=8903 | pages=950–951 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(94)90067-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and since then other types of cells such as [[hepatocytes]], adult [[stem cells]] and genetically engineered cells have been encapsulated and are under study for use in tissue regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Liu | first=ZC | last2=Chang | first2=TM | title=Coencapsulation of hepatocytes and bone marrow stem cells: in vitro conversion of ammonia and in vivo lowering of bilirubin in hyperbilirubemia Gunn rats. | journal=The International Journal of Artificial Organs | date=June 2003 | volume=26 | issue=6 | pages=491–7 | pmid=12894754 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aebischer | first=Patrick | last2=Schluep | first2=Myriam | last3=Déglon | first3=Nicole | last4=Joseph | first4=Jean-Marc | last5=Hirt | first5=Lorenz | last6=Heyd | first6=Bruno | last7=Goddard | first7=Moses | last8=Hammang | first8=Joseph P. | last9=Zurn | first9=Anne D. | last10=Kato | first10=Ann C. | last11=Regli | first11=Franco | last12=Baetge | first12=E.

By 2014, self-replicating, synthetic bacterial cells with cell walls and synthetic DNA had been produced. In January of that year researchers produced an artificial [[eukaryotic cell]] capable of undertaking multiple chemical reactions through working [[organelle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmag.com/first-plastic-artificial-cell-working-organelles/30460/ |title=World-first working eukaryotic cell made from plastic |publisher=Gizmag.com |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = R. | doi = 10.1038/nchem.1840 | title = Nanoreactors: Catalysis in compartments | journal = Nature Chemistry | volume = 6 | page = 5| year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Materials==

[[File:Artificial cell membranes.png|thumb|450px|alt=Different types of artificial cell membranes. |Representative types of artificial cell membranes.]]

Membranes for artificial cells be made of simple [[polymers]], crosslinked proteins, [[lipid membranes]] or polymer-lipid complexes. Further, membranes can be engineered to present surface [[proteins]] such as [[albumin]], [[antigens]], [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na/K-ATPase]] carriers, or pores such as [[ion channels]].
Commonly used materials for the production of membranes include hydrogel polymers such as [[alginic acid|alginate]], [[cellulose]] and [[thermoplastic]] polymers such as hydroxyethyl methacrylate-methyl methacrylate (HEMA- MMA), polyacrylonitrile-polyvinyl chloride (PAN-PVC), as well as variations of the above-mentioned.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; The material used determines the permeability of the cell membrane, which for polymer depends on the [[Molecular Weight Cut Off|molecular weight cut off]] (MWCO).&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; The MWCO is the maximum molecular weight of a molecule that may freely pass through the pores and is important in determining adequate [[diffusion]] of nutrients, waste and other critical molecules.
Hydrophilic polymers have the potential to be [[Biocompatibility|biocompatible]] and can be fabricated into a variety of forms which include polymer [[micelles]], [[sol-gel]] mixtures, physical blends and crosslinked particles and nanoparticles.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; Of special interest are stimuli-responsive polymers that respond to [[pH]] or temperature changes for the use in targeted delivery. These polymers may be administered in the liquid form through a macroscopic injection and solidify or gel ''in situ'' because of the difference in pH or temperature. [[Nanoparticle]] and [[liposome]] preparations are also routinely used for material encapsulation and delivery.  A major advantage of liposomes is their ability to [[Lipid bilayer fusion|fuse]] to cell and [[organelle]] membranes.

==Preparation==
Many variations for artificial cell preparation and encapsulation have been developed. Typically, vesicles such as a [[Nanoparticle#Synthesis|nanoparticle]], [[Polymersome#Preparation|polymersome]] or [[Liposome#Manufacturing|liposome]] are synthesized. An emulsion is typically made through the use of high pressure equipment such as a high pressure [[homogenizer]] or a [[Microfluidizer]]. Two [[micro-encapsulation]] methods for nitrocellulose are also described below.

In a high-pressure homogenizer, two liquids in oil/liquid suspension are forced through a small orifice under very high pressure. This process divides the products and allows the creation of extremely fine particles, as small as 1&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Microfluidization===
This technique uses a patented Microfluidizer to obtain a greater amount of homogenous suspensions that can create smaller particles than homogenizers. A homogenizer is first used to create a coarse suspension which is then pumped into the microfluidizer under high pressure. The flow is then split into two streams which will react at very high velocities in an interaction chamber until desired particle size is obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Vivier | first=A | last2=Vuillemard | first2=JC | last3=Ackermann | first3=HW | last4=Poncelet | first4=D | title=Large-scale blood substitute production using a microfluidizer | journal=Biomaterials, Artificial Cells, and Immobilization Biotechnology |year=1992 | volume=20 | issue=2–4 | pages=377–97 | pmid=1391454 | doi=10.3109/10731199209119658}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique allows for large scale production of phospholipid liposomes and subsequent material nanoencapsulations.

===Drop method===
In this method, a cell solution is incorporated dropwise into a [[collodion]] solution of cellulose nitrate. As the drop travels through the collodion, it is coated with a membrane thanks to the interfacial polymerization properties of the collodion. The cell later settles into paraffin where the membrane sets and is finally suspended a saline solution. The drop method is used for the creation of large artificial cells which encapsulate biological cells, stem cells and genetically engineered stem cells.

===Emulsion method===
The [[emulsion]] method differs in that the material to be encapsulated is usually smaller and is placed in the bottom of a reaction chamber where the collodion is added on top and centrifuged, or otherwise disturbed in order to create an emulsion. The encapsulated material is then dispersed and suspended in saline solution.

==Clinical relevance==

===Drug release and delivery===
Artificial cells used for [[drug delivery]] differ from other artificial cells since their contents are intended to diffuse out of the membrane, or be engulfed and digested by a host target cell. Often used are submicron, lipid membrane artificial cells that may be referred to as nanocapsules, nanoparticles, polymersomes, or other variations of the term.

===Enzyme therapy===
[[Enzyme]] therapy is being actively studied for [[inborn error of metabolism|genetic metabolic diseases]] where an enzyme is over-expressed, under-expressed, defective, or not at all there. In the case of under-expression or expression of a defective [[enzyme]], an active form of the enzyme is introduced in the body to compensate for the deficit. On the other hand, an enzymatic over-expression may be counteracted by introduction of a competing non-functional enzyme; that is, an enzyme which [[Metabolism|metabolizes]] the substrate into non-active products. When placed within an artificial cell, enzymes can carry out their function for a much longer period compared to free enzymes&lt;ref name= 'Chang 2007' /&gt; and can be further optimized by polymer conjugation.&lt;ref&gt;Park et al 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

The first enzyme studied under artificial cell encapsulation was [[asparaginase]] for the treatment of [[lymphosarcoma]] in mice. This treatment delayed the onset and growth of the [[tumor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=TM|title=The in vivo effects of semipermeable microcapsules containing L-asparaginase on 6C3HED lymphosarcoma.|journal=Nature|date=8 January 1971 |volume=229|issue=5280|pages=117–8|pmid=4923094|doi=10.1038/229117a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These initial findings led to further research in the use of artificial cells for enzyme delivery in [[tyrosine]] dependent [[melanomas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yu|first=B|author2=Chang, TM|title=Effects of long-term oral administration of polymeric microcapsules containing tyrosinase on maintaining decreased systemic tyrosine levels in rats.|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|date=April 2004 |volume=93|issue=4|pages=831–7|pmid=14999721|doi=10.1002/jps.10593}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tumors have a higher dependency on [[tyrosine]] than normal cells for growth, and research has shown that lowering systemic levels of tyrosine in mice can inhibit growth of melanomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meadows|first=GG|author2=Pierson, HF|author3=Abdallah, RM|author4=Desai, PR|title=Dietary influence of tyrosine and phenylalanine on the response of B16 melanoma to carbidopa-levodopa methyl ester chemotherapy.|journal=Cancer Research|date=August 1982 |volume=42|issue=8|pages=3056–63|pmid=7093952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of artificial cells in the delivery of [[tyrosinase]]; and enzyme that digests tyrosine, allows for better enzyme stability and is shown effective in the removal of tyrosine without the severe side-effects associated with tyrosine depravation in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=TM|title=Artificial cell bioencapsulation in macro, micro, nano, and molecular dimensions: keynote lecture.|journal=Artificial cells, blood substitutes, and immobilization biotechnology|date=February 2004 |volume=32|issue=1|pages=1–23|pmid=15027798|doi=10.1081/bio-120028665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial cell enzyme therapy is also of interest for the activation of [[prodrugs]] such as [[ifosfamide]] in certain cancers. Artificial cells encapsulating the [[cytochrome p450]] enzyme which converts this prodrug into the active drug can be tailored to accumulate in the pancreatic carcinoma or implanting the artificial cells close to the tumor site. Here, the local concentration of the activated ifosfamide will be much higher than in the rest of the body thus preventing systemic [[toxicity]].&lt;ref name='Lohr'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microencapsulated, CYP2B1-transfected cells activating ifosfamide at the site of the tumor; the magic bullets of the 21st century|journal=Cancer Chemother Pharmacol|year=2002|volume=49|pages=S21–24|pmid=12042985|doi=10.1007/s00280-002-0448-0|vauthors=Löhr M, Hummel F, Faulmann G, Ringel J, Saller R, Hain J, Günzburg WH, Salmons B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment was successful in animals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Intraarterial instillation of microencapsulated cells in the pancreatic arteries in pig|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|year=1999|volume=3|pmid=12649565|doi=10.1159/000069147|issue=1|pages=55–63|vauthors=Kröger JC, Benz S, Hoffmeyer A, Bago Z, Bergmeister H, Günzburg WH, Karle P, Klöppel G, Losert U, Müller P, Nizze H, Obermaier R, Probst A, Renner M, Saller R, Salmons B, Schwendenwein I, von Rombs K, Wiessner R, Wagner T, Hauenstein K, Löhr M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and showed a doubling in median survivals amongst patients with advanced-stage [[pancreatic cancer]] in phase I/II clinical trials, and a tripling in one-year survival rate.&lt;ref name=Lohr/&gt;

===Gene therapy===
In treatment of genetic diseases, [[gene therapy]] aims to insert, alter or remove [[genes]] within an afflicted individual's cells. The technology relies heavily on viral [[vector (molecular biology)|vectors]] which raises concerns about insertional [[mutagenesis]] and systemic [[immune response]] that have led to human deaths&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carmen|first=I|title=A Death in the Laboratory: The Politics of the Gelsinger Aftermath|journal=Molecular Therapy|date=1 April 2001 |volume=3|issue=4|pages=425–428|doi=10.1006/mthe.2001.0305|pmid=11319902}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chirmule N, Lee FS, Wivel NA, Bagg A, Gao GP, Wilson JM, Batshaw ML |title=Fatal systemic inflammatory response syndrome in a ornithine transcarbamylase deficient patient following adenoviral gene transfer|journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism|date=1 September 2003 |volume=80|issue=1–2|pages=148–158|doi=10.1016/j.ymgme.2003.08.016|pmid=14567964}}&lt;/ref&gt; and development of [[leukemia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cavazzana-Calvo|first=M.|title=Gene Therapy of Human Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)-X1 Disease|journal=Science|date=28 April 2000 |volume=288|issue=5466|pages=669–672|doi=10.1126/science.288.5466.669|pmid=10784449|last2=Hacein-Bey|first2=S|last3=De Saint Basile|first3=G|last4=Gross|first4=F|last5=Yvon|first5=E|last6=Nusbaum|first6=P|last7=Selz|first7=F|last8=Hue|first8=C|last9=Certain|first9=S|last10=Casanova|first10=J.

Circumventing the need for vectors by using naked or plasmid DNA as its own delivery system also encounters problems such as low [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] efficiency and poor tissue targeting when given systemically.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt;

Artificial cells have been proposed as a non-viral vector by which genetically modified non-autologous cells are encapsulated and implanted to deliver recombinant proteins ''in vivo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=P|title=The in vivo delivery of heterologous proteins by microencapsulated recombinant cells|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=1 February 1999 |volume=17|issue=2|pages=78–83|doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(98)01250-5|pmid=10087608|last2=Van Raamsdonk|first2=J.

===Hemoperfusion===
The first clinical use of artificial cells was in [[hemoperfusion]] by the encapsulation of [[activated charcoal]].&lt;ref name="Chang 1996"/&gt; Activated charcoal has the capability of adsorbing many large molecules and has for a long time been known for its ability to remove toxic substances from the blood in accidental poisoning or overdose. However, [[perfusion]] through direct charcoal administration is toxic as it leads to [[embolism]]s and damage of blood cells followed by removal by platelets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DUNEA|first=G|author2=KOLFF, WJ|title=CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE YATZIDIS CHARCOAL ARTIFICIAL KIDNEY.|journal=Transactions - American Society for Artificial Internal Organs|year=1965|volume=11|pages=178–82|pmid=14329080|doi=10.1097/00002480-196504000-00035}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artificial cells allow toxins to diffuse into the cell while keeping the dangerous cargo within their ultrathin membrane.&lt;ref name= 'Chang 1996' /&gt;

Artificial cell [[hemoperfusion]] has been proposed as a less costly and more efficient detoxifying option than [[hemodialysis]],&lt;ref name="Chang 2007"/&gt; in which blood filtering takes place only through size separation by a physical membrane.  In hemoperfusion, thousands of adsorbent artificial cells are retained inside a small container through the use of two screens on either end through which patient blood [[perfusion|perfuses]]. As the blood circulates, [[toxins]] or drugs diffuse into the cells and are retained by the absorbing material. The membranes of artificial cells are much thinner those used in dialysis and their small size means that they have a high membrane [[surface area]]. This means that a portion of cell can have a theoretical mass transfer that is a hundredfold higher than that of a whole artificial kidney machine.&lt;ref name='Chang 2007' /&gt; The device has been established as a routine clinical method for patients treated for accidental or suicidal poisoning but has also been introduced as therapy in [[liver failure]] and [[renal failure|kidney failure]] by carrying out part of the function of these organs.&lt;ref name= 'Chang 2007' /&gt;
Artificial cell hemoperfusion has also been proposed for use in immunoadsorption through which antibodies can be removed from the body by attaching an immunoadsorbing material such as [[albumin]] on the surface of the artificial cells. This principle has been used to remove [[blood type|blood group]] antibodies from plasma for bone marrow transplantation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bensinger|first=WI|author2=Buckner, CD|author3=Clift, RA|title=Whole blood immunoadsorption of anti-A or anti-B antibodies.|journal=Vox sanguinis|year=1985|volume=48|issue=6|pages=357–61|pmid=3892895|doi=10.1111/j.1423-0410.1985.tb00196.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the treatment of [[hypercholesterolemia]] through [[monoclonal antibodies]] to remove low-density [[lipoproteins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=L|author2=Cheng, Y|author3=Yan, WR|author4=Yu, YT|title=Extracorporeal whole blood immunoadsorption of autoimmune myasthenia gravis by cellulose tryptophan adsorbent.|journal=Artificial cells, blood substitutes, and immobilization biotechnology|year=2004|volume=32|issue=4|pages=519–28|pmid=15974179|doi=10.1081/bio-200039610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemoperfusion is especially useful in countries with a weak hemodialysis manufacturing industry as the devices tend to be cheaper there and used in [[renal failure|kidney failure]] patients.

===Encapsulated cells===

[[File:Cell capsule schematic.png|thumb|300px|alt=Schematic of cells encapsulated within an artificial membrane.|Schematic representation of encapsulated cells within artificial membrane.]]

The most common method of preparation of artificial cells is through [[cell encapsulation]]. Encapsulated cells are typically achieved through the generation of controlled-size droplets from a liquid cell [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] which are then rapidly solidified or gelated to provide added stability. The stabilization may be achieved through a change in temperature or via material crosslinking.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; The microenvironment that a cell sees changes upon encapsulation. It typically goes from being on a [[monolayer]] to a suspension in a polymer scaffold within a polymeric membrane. A drawback of the technique is that encapsulating a cell decreases its viability and ability to proliferate and differentiate.&lt;ref&gt;In Wolff, J.A., (editor), Chang, M.T.S. et al (1994) Calcium phosphate-mediated DNA transfection. ''Gene Therapeutics'' Boston, Birkhauser Boston, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Further,  after some time within the microcapsule, cells form clusters that inhibit the exchange of oxygen and metabolic waste,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ponce|first=S|author2=Orive, G|author3=Gascón, AR|author4=Hernández, RM|author5=Pedraz, JL|title=Microcapsules prepared with different biomaterials to immobilize GDNF secreting 3T3 fibroblasts|journal=International journal of pharmaceutics|date=11 April 2005 |volume=293|issue=1–2|pages=1–10|pmid=15778039|doi=10.1016/j.ijpharm.2004.10.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to [[apoptosis]] and [[necrosis]] thus limiting the efficacy of the cells and activating the host's [[immune system]].
Artificial cells have been successful for transplanting a number of cells including [[islets of Langerhans]] for [[type 1 diabetes|diabetes]] treatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kizilel|first=Seda|author2=Garfinkel, Marc|author3=Opara, Emmanuel|title=The Bioartificial Pancreas: Progress and Challenges|journal=Diabetes Technology &amp; Therapeutics|date=1 December 2005 |volume=7|issue=6|pages=968–985|doi=10.1089/dia.2005.7.968|pmid=16386103}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Parathyroid chief cell|parathyroid cells]] and adrenal cortex cells.

====Encapsulated hepatocytes====
Shortage of organ donors make artificial cells key players in alternative therapies for [[liver failure]]. The use of artificial cells for [[hepatocyte]] transplantation has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy in providing liver function in models of animal liver disease and [[bioartificial liver devices]].&lt;ref name=Dixit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixit|first=Vivek|author2=Gitnick, Gary|title=The bioartificial liver: state-of-the-art|journal=European Journal of Surgery|date=27 November 2003 |volume=164|issue=S12|pages=71–76|doi=10.1080/11024159850191481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research stemmed off experiments in which the hepatocytes were attached to the surface of a micro-carriers&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and has evolved into hepatocytes which are encapsulated in a three-dimensional matrix in [[alginate]] microdroplets covered by an outer skin of [[polylysine]]. A key advantage to this delivery method is the circumvention of [[immunosuppression]] therapy for the duration of the treatment. Hepatocyte encapsulations have been proposed for use in a [[bioartificial liver device|bioartifical liver]]. The device consists of a cylindrical chamber imbedded with isolated hepatocytes through which patient plasma is circulated extra-corporeally in a type of [[hemoperfusion]]. Because microcapsules have a high [[surface area]] to [[volume]] ratio, they provide large surface for substrate diffusion and can accommodate a large number of hepatocytes. Treatment to induced liver failure mice showed a significant increase in the rate of survival.&lt;ref name= 'Dixit' /&gt; Artificial liver systems are still in early development but show potential for patients waiting for [[organ transplant]] or while a patient's own liver regenerates sufficiently to resume normal function. So far, clinical trials using artificial liver systems and hepatocyte transplantation in end-stage liver diseases have shown improvement of health markers but have not yet improved survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sgroi|first=A|author2=Serre-Beinier, V|author3=Morel, P|author4=Bühler, L|title=What clinical alternatives to whole liver transplantation?

The proposed mechanism of action is not fully understood but is believed to have two main effects. The first is the nutritional effect, in which the bacteria compete with toxin producing bacteria. The second is the sanitary effect, which stimulates resistance to colonization and stimulates [[immune response]].&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt;  The oral delivery of bacterial cultures is often a problem because they are targeted by the immune system and often destroyed when taken orally.

===Artificial blood cell===

====Oxygen carriers====
{{main|Haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers}}
Nano sized oxygen carriers are used as a type of [[red blood cell]] substitutes, although they lack other components of red blood cells. They are composed of a synthetic [[polymersome]] or an artificial membrane surrounding purified animal, human or recombinant [[hemoglobin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=HW|author2=Greenburg, AG|title=Artificial oxygen carriers as red blood cell substitutes: a selected review and current status.|journal=Artificial Organs|date=September 2004 |volume=28|issue=9|pages=813–28|pmid=15320945|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1594.2004.07345.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Overall, hemoglobin delivery continues to be a challenge because it is highly toxic when delivered without any modifications. In some clinical trials, vasopressor effects have been observed for first generation hemoglobin blood substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson 1998, Burhop and Estep 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Red blood cells====
Research interest in the use of artificial cells for blood arose after the [[AIDS]] scare of the 1980s. Besides bypassing the potential for disease transmission, artificial red blood cells are desired because they eliminate drawbacks associated with allogenic blood transfusions such as blood typing, immune reactions and its short storage life of 42 days. A [[hemoglobin]] substitute may be stored at room temperature and not under refrigeration for more than a year.&lt;ref name= 'Chang 2007' /&gt; Attempts have been made to develop a complete working red blood cell which comprises carbonic not only an oxygen carrier but also the enzymes associated with the cell. The first attempt was made in 1957 by replacing the red blood cell membrane by an ultrathin polymeric membrane&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=30th Anniversary in Artificial Red Blood Cell Research|journal=Artificial Cells, Blood Substitutes and Biotechnology|date=1 January 1988 |volume=16|issue=1–3|pages=1–9|doi=10.3109/10731198809132551}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by encapsulation through a [[lipid membrane]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djordjevich|first=L|author2=Miller, IF|title=Synthetic erythrocytes from lipid encapsulated hemoglobin.|journal=Experimental hematology|date=May 1980 |volume=8|issue=5|pages=584–92|pmid=7461058}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and more recently a biodegradable polymeric membrane.&lt;ref name= 'Chang 2007' /&gt;
A biological red blood cell membrane including [[lipids]] and associated proteins can also be used to encapsulate nanoparticles and increase residence time in vivo by bypassing [[macrophage]] uptake and systemic clearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu|first=CM|author2=Zhang, L|author3=Aryal, S|author4=Cheung, C|author5=Fang, RH|author6=Zhang, L|title=Erythrocyte membrane-camouflaged polymeric nanoparticles as a biomimetic delivery platform.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=5 July 2011 |volume=108|issue=27|pages=10980–5|pmid=21690347|doi=10.1073/pnas.1106634108|pmc=3131364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leuko-polymersome====
A leuko-polymersome is a [[polymersome]] engineered to have the adhesive properties of a [[leukocyte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hammer|first=Daniel A.|author2=Robbins, Gregory P. |title=Leuko-polymersomes|journal=Faraday Discussions|date=1 January 2008 |volume=139|page=129|doi=10.1039/B717821B|last3=Haun|first3=Jered B.|last4=Lin|first4=John J.|last5=Qi|first5=Wei|last6=Smith|first6=Lee A.|last7=Peter Ghoroghchian|first7=P.|last8=Therien|first8=Michael J.|last9=Bates|first9=Frank S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polymersomes are vesicles composed of a bilayer sheet that can encapsulate many active molecules such as drugs or [[enzymes]]. By adding the adhesive properties of a leukocyte to their membranes, they can be made to slow down, or roll along epithelial walls within the quickly flowing [[circulatory system]].

==Synthetic cells==

===The minimal cell===
The German pathologist [[Rudolf Virchow]] brought forward the idea that not only does life arise from cells, but every cell comes from another cell;  "''Omnis cellula e cellula''".&lt;ref&gt;Virchow RLK (1858) Die cellularpathologie in ihrer begründung auf physiologische und pathologische gewebelehre (A. Hirschwald, Berlin) p xv&lt;/ref&gt; Until now, most attempts to create an artificial cell have only created a package that can mimic certain tasks of the cell. Advances in cell-free [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] reactions allow the expression of many [[genes]], but these efforts are far from producing a fully operational cell.

The future is in the creation of a [[protocell]], or a cell which has all the minimum requirements for life. Members from the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] have used a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] computational approach to knock out genes in a living organism to a minimum set of genes.&lt;ref name="gibson52"/&gt; In 2010, the team succeeded in creating a replicating strain of ''[[Mycoplasma mycoides]]'' ([[Mycoplasma laboratorium]]) using synthetically created DNA deemed to be the minimum requirement for life which was inserted into a genomically empty bacterium.&lt;ref name="gibson52"/&gt; It is hoped that the process of top-down biosynthesis will enable the insertion of new genes that would perform profitable functions such as generation of hydrogen for fuel or capturing excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name='Beadau'&gt;{{cite book| editor-last=Beadau| editor-first=Mark A.| title=The ethics of protocells moral and social implications of creating life in the laboratory| year=2009| publisher=MIT Press| location=Cambridge, Mass.| isbn=978-0-262-51269-5| edition=[Online-Ausg.] |author=Parke, Emily C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the myriad regulatory, metabolic, and signaling networks are not completely characterized. These [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] approaches have limitations for the understanding of fundamental molecular regulation, since the host organisms have a complex and incompletely defined molecular composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nanoporous Silica-Based Protocells at Multiple Scales for Designs of Life and Nanomedicine |journal=Life |year=2014 |last=Armstrong |first=Rachel |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=457–490 |doi=10.3390/life4030457 |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/4/3/457/htm |accessdate=2015-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] approach to build an artificial cell would involve creating a protocell ''de novo'', entirely from non-living materials. It is proposed to create a [[phospholipid bilayer]] vesicle with DNA capable of self-reproducing using synthetic genetic information. The three primary elements of such artificial cells are the formation of a [[lipid membrane]], [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] replication through a template process and the harvesting of chemical energy for [[active transport]] across the membrane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Szostak|first=Jack W.|author2=Bartel, David P.|author3=Luisi, P.

So far, no completely artificial cell capable of self-reproduction has been synthesized using the molecules of life, and this objective is still in a distant future although various groups are currently working towards this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rasmussen|first=S|author2=Chen, L|author3=Nilsson, M|author4=Abe, S|title=Bridging nonliving and living matter.|journal=Artificial Life|date=Summer 2003 |volume=9|issue=3|pages=269–316|pmid=14556688|doi=10.1162/106454603322392479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method proposed to create a protocell more closely resembles the [[RNA world hypothesis|conditions]] believed to have been present during evolution known as the primordial soup. Various RNA polymers could be encapsulated in vesicles and in such small boundary conditions, chemical reactions would be tested for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Walter|title=Origin of life: The RNA world|journal=Nature|date=20 February 1986 |volume=319|issue=6055|pages=618–618|doi=10.1038/319618a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy investing in biology has been done by large companies such as [[ExxonMobil]], who has partnered with [[Synthetic Genomics|Synthetic Genomics Inc]]; Craig Venter's own biosynthetics company in the development of fuel from algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheridan|first=C|title=Big oil bucks for algae.|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=September 2009 |volume=27|issue=9|page=783|pmid=19741613|doi=10.1038/nbt0909-783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic artificial cell===
The concept of an Electronic Artificial Cell has been expanded in a series of 3 EU projects coordinated by John McCaskill from 2004-2015.

The [[European Commission]] sponsored the development of the [http://www.istpace.org//index.html "Programmable Artificial Cell Evolution" (PACE)] program from 2004-2008 whose goal was to lay the foundation for the creation of "microscopic self-organizing, self-replicating, and evolvable autonomous entities built from simple organic and inorganic substances that can be genetically programmed to perform specific functions"&lt;ref&gt;PACE report&lt;/ref&gt; for the eventual integration into information systems. The PACE project developed the first Omega Machine, a microfluidic life support system for artificial cells that could complement chemically missing functionalities (as originally proposed by Norman Packard, Steen Rasmussen, Mark Beadau and John McCaskill). The ultimate aim was to attain an evolvable hybrid cell in a complex microscale programmable environment. The functions of the Omega Machine could then be removed stepwise, posing a series of solvable evolution challenges to the artificial cell chemistry. The project achieved chemical integration up to the level of pairs of the three core functions of artificial cells (a genetic subsystem, a containment system and a metabolic system), and generated novel spatially resolved programmable microfluidic environments for the integration of containment and genetic amplification.[http://www.istpace.org//index.html "Programmable Artificial Cell Evolution" (PACE)]  The project led to the creation of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111214010917/http://www.ecltech.org/ecltech_j/] European center for living technology] which is now continuing similar research.

Following this research, in 2007, John McCaskill proposed to concentrate on an electronically complemented artificial cell, called the '''Electronic Chemical Cell'''. The key idea was to use a massively parallel array of electrodes coupled to locally dedicated electronic circuitry, in a two-dimensional thin film, to complement emerging chemical cellular functionality. Local electronic information defining the electrode switching and sensing circuits could serve as an electronic genome, complementing the molecular sequential information in the emerging protocols. A research proposal was successful with the [[European Commission]] and an international team of scientists partially overlapping with the PACE consortium commenced work 2008-2012 on the project Electronic Chemical Cells. The project demonstrated among other things that electronically controlled local transport of specific sequences could be used as an artificial spatial control system for the genetic proliferation of future artificial cells, and that core processes of metabolism could be delivered by suitably coated electrode arrays.

The major limitation of this approach, apart from the initial difficulties in mastering microscale electrochemistry and electrokinetics, is that the electronic system is interconnected as a rigid non-autonomous piece of macroscopic hardware. In 2011, McCaskill proposed to invert the geometry of electronics and chemistry : instead of placing chemicals in an active electronic medium, to place microscopic autonomous electronics in a chemical medium. He organized a project to tackle a third generation of Electronic Artificial Cells at the 100&amp;nbsp;µm scale that could self-assemble from two half-cells "lablets" to enclose an internal chemical space, and function with the aid of active electronics powered by the medium they are immersed in. Such cells can copy both their electronic and chemical contents and will be capable of evolution within the constraints provided by their special pre-synthesized microscopic building blocks. In Sep 2012 work commenced on this project [http://www.MICREAgents.eu/ Microscale Chemically Reactive Electronic Agents].

===Ethics and controversy===
Protocell research has created controversy and opposing opinions, including critics of the vague definition of "artificial life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Life after the synthetic cell|journal=Nature|date=27 May 2010 |volume=465|issue=7297|pages=422–424|doi=10.1038/465422a|pmid=20495545|author1=Bedau|first1=M|last2=Church|first2=G|last3=Rasmussen|first3=S|last4=Caplan|first4=A|last5=Benner|first5=S|last6=Fussenegger|first6=M|last7=Collins|first7=J|last8=Deamer|first8=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creation of a basic unit of life is the most pressing ethical concern, although the most widespread worry about protocells is their potential threat to human health and the environment through uncontrolled replication.&lt;ref name='Beadau'/&gt;

'''Artificial seawater''' ([[abbreviation|abbreviated]] '''ASW''') is a mixture of dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|mineral salts]] (and sometimes [[vitamin]]s) that simulates [[seawater]]. Artificial seawater is primarily used in [[marine biology]] and in [[marine aquarium|marine]] and [[reef aquarium|reef aquaria]], and allows the easy preparation of [[growth medium|media]] appropriate for marine [[organism]]s (including [[algae]], [[bacteria]], [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s). From a [[scientific method|scientific perspective]], artificial seawater has the advantage of [[reproducibility]] over natural seawater since it is a standardized formula. Synthetic seawater is also known as artificial seawater and substitute ocean water. 

==Example==
The tables below present an example of an artificial seawater (35.00[[Per mille|‰]] of salinity) preparation devised by Kester, Duedall, Connors and Pytkowicz (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Kester, D.

''Limnology &amp; Oceanography'' '''12''', 176—179.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recipe consists of two lists of mineral salts, the first of [[anhydrous]] salts that can be weighed out, the second of [[hydrate|hydrous]] salts that should be added to the artificial seawater as a solution.

[[File:Moorland near Bellacorick, north Mayo. - geograph.org.uk - 71273.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Moorland near Bellacorick]]
[[File:Bellacorick County Mayo Summer 2010.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Bellacorick blanket bog June 2010]]

'''Bellacorick''' or '''Bellacoric''' ({{irish place name|Béal Átha Chomhraic|ford mouth of the confluence}}) is a [[townland]] in [[County Mayo]], Ireland. It comprises an area of {{convert|800|acre|km2}}. The area is remote, virtually uninhabited [[blanket bog]] which was once used mainly for milled peat production. Nowadays, it is a [[Special Area of Conservation]] because of the unique nature of the intact blanket bog habitat. The main [[Belmullet]] to [[Castlebar]] and [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]] road passes through this townland.

== History ==
There is virtually no [[arable land]] in this area of lowland blanket bog but in the 19th century the area was leased to a Patrick Burke who housed horses in stables opposite the public house which comprises virtually all of this [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]].  There was a shooting lodge which later became the post office, but this was later moved again to Kilsallagh and there is now no post office in Bellacorick.  There used to be a Garda Station close to the Bridge but it was abandoned around 1940 and the area was policed by Crossmolina.

=== The Musical Bridge ===

[[File:Musical bridge Bellacorick June 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Musical Bridge, Bellacorick]]In about 1820, the civil engineer, [[William Bald]], who was mapping the area and building roads through [[Erris]], designed the Bellacorick Bridge, known as the Musical Bridge, it can be 'played' in two different ways:
* The first way is by rolling a stone along the parapet on either side.  As the stone drops along musical notes are produced in rapid succession.
* The second method is to hold the stone in your hand and to strike it on the slabs which form the coping of the parapet hitting each slab as you go along and drawing back the hand immediately after striking.  Each slab gives forth its own peculiar note and a musical scale is produced.

The bridge was difficult to erect.  Because of the remarkable soundness of the earth the foundation had to be secured by timber.  It has four elliptical arches each thirty feet apart, with battlements nearly {{convert|400|ft|m}} long.  The Erris prophet [[Brian Rua U'Cearbhain]] referred to the then unbuilt bridge at Bellacorick in the 17th century.  He said that it would never be finished and it never has been.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inver.org/ceantar/des.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Energy generation ==

=== Peat-fired power station ===
[[Peat]] has been Ireland's staple fuel for centuries and still provides about 12% of the nation's energy needs.  In June 1949, James Kilroy TD, representing [[Erris]], requested the government to build a 'turf fired power station for the generation of electricity in Erris.  He also pointed out the advantage of reclaiming the bog and introducing a scheme of afforestation!.  The [[ESB Customer Supply|ESB]] acquired five and a half acres, two hundred metres from the bridge as the site for the [[power station]].  The access road was built over the ruins of the old shooting lodge.  At the same time [[Bord na Mona]] bought {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} of bogland.  They harvested the turf to feed the power station.  The peat was pulverised and dried in the summer.  It was stored on the bog in large polythene covered piles.  It was then taken to the station by railway wagons pulled by diesel locomotives.

==== Closure ====
In 2007 the massive chimney at Bellacorick was demolished for safety reasons.  Even those who would have been opposed to the fossil-fuel burning power station on [[Environmental policy|environmental]] and [[greenhouse gas]] grounds were sad to see the chimney demolished as it had become a well-known landmark for those returning home to [[Erris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crossmolina.ie/The-News/Local-News/Bellacorrick-peat%11burning-tower-torn-down-20071014958/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609211127/http://www.crossmolina.ie/The-News/Local-News/Bellacorrick-peat%11burning-tower-torn-down-20071014958/ |archivedate=9 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unfortunately, although the visually attractive chimney has been removed, the visually offensive [[Abandoned property|derelict]] sixties-style block buildings, several storeys in height, are still standing, ungraciously draped with green netting, as a blot on the landscape.  As a result, it is difficult to get a decent view of the white windmills of the [[windfarm]] at the site.

=== Wind farm ===
Since 1992 Ireland's first commercial [[wind farm]] has been operating at Bellacorick.  The wind farm comprised 21 [[wind turbines]] with a total installed capacity of 6.45 [[megawatt]]s and produces enough electricity to supply 4,500 households.

The North Mayo area had long been identified as perhaps the best wind farm site in the country.  All the key criteria for a successful wind farm project were satisfied at Bellacorick.  The mean annual [[wind speed]] at the site at a height of 30 metres is 7.28&amp;nbsp;m/s.  The prevailing wind direction is south-westerly and the wind blows from the south west 50% of the time.  The wind regime is strong, steady winds.  The ground is flat with an open aspect to the prevailing winds, resulting in virtually no loss or [[turbulence]] due to [[topographical]] features. The nearby [[thermal]] [[power station]] is linked to the National Electricity Grid.  The Bellacorick [[wind farm]] is owned and operated by Renewable Energy Ireland whose major shareholder is [[Bord na Mona]].
The [[environment (systems)|environmental]] benefits of the wind farm can be stated in terms of [[Sustainability|environmental impacts]] avoided through not having to generate electricity from [[fossil fuel]] sources&amp;nbsp;– coal, [[peat]], oil and gas.  Bellacorick wind farm avoids the production of 120 tonnes of [[sulphur dioxide]], 85 tonnes of [[nitrous oxide]]s and 20,000 tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] in a year.

On 16 February 2011, Capital Approval for the 400 kV Grid West Electricity Transmission Scheme (Grid West) was granted by the [[EirGrid]] Board. The project is driven by the need to connect 646.5 MW of Gate 3 wind generation at Bellacorick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eirgridprojects.com/media/Grid25%20issue%203%20April%202010.pdf Grid25 -3] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523080753/http://www.eirgridprojects.com/media/Grid25%20issue%203%20April%202010.pdf |date=23 May 2013 }} ''[[EirGrid]]''.

== Transport ==
Bus Éireann route 446 links Bellacorick with [[Crossmolina]] and [[Ballina, County Mayo|Ballina]]. In the reverse direction it links to [[Bangor Erris]], [[Belmullet]] and locations on the [[Mullet Peninsula]]. There is one service a day in each direction, including Sundays. On Friday evenings an extra journey operates from Ballina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buseireann.ie/pdf/1279700047-446.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517022954/http://www.buseireann.ie/pdf/1279700047-446.pdf |archivedate=17 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Onward rail and bus connections are available at Ballina.

== History of the Concept ==

''Biofact'' was introduced as early as 2001 by the German philosopher [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]]&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis: ''Biologisch, natürlich, nachhaltig. Philosophische Aspekte des Naturzugangs im 21. Jahrhundert.'' Tuebingen: A. Francke Publisher; chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt; although her book ''Biofakte'' published in 2003 is commonly used as reference for the introduction of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole C. Karafyllis (Hg.), ''Biofakte. Versuch über den Menschen zwischen Artefakt und Lebewesen'', Mentis: Paderborn 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Karafyllis, the word '''biofact''' first appeared in a German article (entitled 'Biofakt und Artefakt') in 1943, written by the Austrian protozoologist Bruno M. Klein.&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Maria Klein: Artefakt und Biofakt, in: Mikrokosmos 1943/44&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing both microscopy and philosophy, Klein named a [[Biofact (biology)|biofact]] something that is a visible dead product emerging from a living being while this being is still alive (e.g. a shell). However, Klein's distinction operated with the difference biotic/abiotic and dead/alive, not with nature/technology and growth/man-made. For her part, Karafyllis described biofact as a [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic concept]] that allows the comparison between nature and [[technology]] in the domain of the living.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Genetics &amp; Society: Mapping the New Genomic Era|last=Atkinson|first=Paul|last2=Glasner|first2=Peter|last3=Lock|first3=Margaret|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|isbn=0203927389|location=Oxon|pages=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly 

== Philosophy of the Concept ==

With the term ''biofact'', Karafyllis wants to emphasize that living entities can be highly artificial due to methods deriving from agriculture, gardening (e.g. breeding) or [[biotechnology]] (e.g. [[genetic engineering]], [[cloning]]).  Biofacts show signatures of [[culture]] and technique.
Primarily, the concept aims to argue against the common philosophical tradition to summarize all kinds of living beings under the category [[nature]]. The concept ''biofact'' questions if the phenomenon of growth is and was a secure candidate for differentiating between nature and technology.

For the [[philosophy of technology]] the questions arise if a) biotechnology and [[agriculture]] should not be an integral part of ''reflexion'', thereby adding new insights to the common focus on the [[machine]] and the artifact, and if b) established concepts of technique and technology which stress artificiality should not be modified. Karafyllis regards the inclusion of biofacts into a theory of techniques as a chance, to reformulate classic concepts of [[design]] and [[construction]] for defining the making of artifacts. In her view, biofacts depend on the method of provocation.&lt;ref&gt;Karafyllis, N. C.: Provokation als Methode der biotechnischen Evolution, in: Volker Gerhardt, Klaus Lucas and Günter Stock (Eds.): ''Evolution. Theorie, Formen und Konsequenzen eines Paradigmas in Natur, Technik und Kultur''. Berlin: Akademie Verlag 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[philosophy of nature]], biofacts highlight a need to clarify if nature is self-explanatory in every case. [[Biophilosophy]] is challenged to newly reflect upon the categories organism and [[living being]].&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Schark: ''Lebewesen versus Dinge'', De Gruyter 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[philosophy of science]], approaches are challenged which only focus on the category thing (or epistemic thing) without historizing the technicality, mediality and materiality of its emerging as a living object. For the [[sociology of science]] the biofact concept is fruitful to discuss the exclusiveness of scientific knowledge (the role of the [[expert]]) while making scientific objects which are released into the [[lifeworld]] or public sphere.  Particularly because the biofact concept deals with the [[phenomenon]] of growth and the establishing of a [[self]], it is also influential in the philosophical disciplines phenomenology, [[anthropology]] and [[ontology]]. It was [[Jürgen Habermas]] who recently stressed the anthropological consequences if mankind gives up the differentiation of "coming into being" and "making".&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas: ''Die Zukunft der menschlichen Natur'', Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artifacts are artificial, i.e. man-made objects. Contrary to biofacts, they cannot be found in nature. Therefore, biofacts demarcate an ontological intersection. They are partially man-made, but growing. Like artifacts, they have been made for a certain [[utility]]. Biofacts can be seen as biotic artifacts which show their character as hybrids in multifold perspectives.

The term is also enabling philosophers to criticize some concepts in [[technoscience]], where the union of scientific knowledge about nature and the technical creation of technonature is seen as progress in the political sense.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Bruno Latour: ''Politics of Natur. How to bring the Sciences into Democracy'', Harvard University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has also been adopted in the new [[BioArt]], not rarely without using its critical impacts.

As Karafyllis complemented the growth and reproduction of organisms with technical entities, she established a typology of different kinds of organisms according to their uses and these are:

* Natural life form
* Unaltered biofacts
* Reshaped biofacts
* Genetically reproduced biofacts
* Genetically modified biofacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Synthetic Biology: Metaphors, Worldviews, Ethics, and Law|last=Boldt|first=Joachim|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783658109875|location=Wiesbaden|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christianity and domestic violence''' deals with the debate in Christian communities in relation to the recognition and response to [[domestic violence]], which is complicated by a culture of silence and acceptance among abuse victims. There are some Bible verses that abusers use to justify discipline of their wives.

==Abuse within marriage==
{{main|Gender roles in Christianity}}
[[Christianity|Christian]] groups and authorities generally condemn [[domestic violence]] as inconsistent with the general Christian duty to love others and to the scriptural relationship between husband and wife.&lt;ref name=stct&gt;Tracy, Steven. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/february/5.50.html "Headship with a Heart: How biblical patriarchy actually prevents abuse"]. ''[[Christianity Today]]'' (February 2003). (Accessed January 3, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship between husband and wife===

According to the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]], "Men who abuse often use Ephesians 5:22, taken out of context, to justify their behavior, but the passage (v. 21-33) refers to the mutual submission of husband and wife out of love for Christ. Husbands should love their wives as they love their own body, as Christ loves the Church."&lt;ref name=usccbwi/&gt;

Some Christian theologians, such as the Rev. Marie Fortune and Mary Pellauer, have raised the question of a close connection between patriarchal Christianity and domestic violence and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Child in Christian Thought|editor1-first=Marcia J. | editor1-last = Bunge | editor1-link=Marcia Bunge|pages=462|year=2001|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-4693-9|author=Bonnie J. Miller-McLemore|chapter="Let the Children Come" Revisited: Contemporary Feminist Theologians on Children}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Catherine Clark Kroeger; Beck, James Beck (ed). (1996). ''Women, Abuse and the Bible.'' Grand Rapids: Baker.&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Tracy, author of "Patriarchy and Domestic Violence" writes: "While patriarchy may not be the overarching cause of all abuse, it is an enormously significant factor, because in traditional patriarchy males have a disproportionate share of power... So while patriarchy is not the sole explanation for violence against women, we would expect that male headship would be distorted by insecure, unhealthy men to justify their domination and abuse of women."&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Steven. (2007). Patriarchy and Domestic Violence: Challenging Common Misconceptions. ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society.'' 50(3):580-583.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between religion and domestic violence,&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;Wilcox, William Bradford. ''Soft Patriarchs, New Men: How Christianity Shapes Fathers and Husbands''. [[University of Chicago Press]] (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=s0cY1rWfxKUC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;sig=JEppuMBRuDKRQsIY5ZxLZHroYy8 p181-82]. {{ISBN|0-226-89709-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dutton, no single factor explanation for wife assault was sufficient to explain the available data.{{refn|"During the late 1970's a number of single factor explanations for male assaultiveness toward women were proffered. These included sociobiology, psychiatric disorders and patriarchy (Dutton, 1988). Dutton argued that no single factor explanation for wife assault sufficiently explained the available data and proposed instead a nested ecological theory examining interactive effects of the broader culture (macrosystem), the subculture (exosystem), the family (microsystem) and individual characteristics (ontogeny)."|group=nb}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} A study by Dutton and Browning in the same year found that misogyny is correlated with only a minority of abusive male partners.{{refn|"Only a minority of batterers are misogynistic (Dutton and Browning, 1988), and few are violent to non-intimate women; a much larger group experiences extreme anger about intimacy."|group=nb}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Campbell's study in 1992 found no evidence of greater violence towards women in more patriarchal cultures. Pearson's study in 1997 observed "Studies of male batterers have failed to confirm that these men are more conservative or sexist about marriage than nonviolent men".{{refn|"‘Patricia Pearson (p. 132) points out: That men have used a patriarchal vocabulary to account for themselves doesn't mean that patriarchy causes their violence, any more than being patriarchs prevents them from being victimized. Studies of male batterers have failed to confirm that these men are more conservative or sexist about marriage than nonviolent men. To the contrary, some of the highest rates of violence are found in the least orthodox partnerships — dating or cohabiting lovers."|group=nb}}&lt;ref name=Correy&gt;Correy, ‘The Role Of Patriarchy In Domestic Violence’ (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Responding to Domestic Abuse,'' a report issued by the Church of England in 2006, suggests that patriarchy should be replaced rather than reinterpreted: "Following the pattern of Christ means that patterns of domination and submission are being transformed in the mutuality of love, faithful care and sharing of burdens. 'Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ'(Ephesians 5.21). Although strong patriarchal tendencies have persisted in Christianity, the example of Christ carries the seeds of their displacement by a more symmetrical and respectful model of male–female relations."&lt;ref name=ceroda&gt;The Archbishops' Council.

Church House Publishing (2006), p19. {{ISBN|0-7151-4108-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bible===
{{Main|The Bible and violence}}
[[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Bible verses]] are often used to justify domestic abuse, such as those that refer to male superiority and female submission. Others counter that the use of violence is a misinterpreted view of the male role.&lt;ref name=stct/&gt;  For instance, [[Eve]] (Genesis 2-3), is seen by some Christians{{Who|date=May 2016}} to be disobedient to patriarchal God and man, and to many a generalized symbol of womanhood that must be submissive and subject to discipline, while others{{Who|date=May 2016}} disagree with this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Pages 92-3. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian domestic discipline===
A subculture known as ''Christian domestic discipline'' (CDD) promotes [[spanking]] of wives by their husbands as a form of punishment. While its advocates rely on Biblical interpretations to support the practice, advocates for victims of domestic violence describe CDD as a form of abuse and controlling behavior. Others describe the practice as a simple [[sexual fetish]] and an outlet for [[sadomasochistic]] desires.&lt;ref name="Zadrozny"&gt;{{cite news |author=Zadrozny, Brandy |date=19 June 2013  |work=The Daily Beast |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/19/spanking-for-jesus-inside-the-unholy-world-of-christian-domestic-discipline.html |title=Spanking for Jesus: Inside the Unholy World of ‘Christian Domestic Discipline’}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christan-conservative radio host [[Bryan Fischer]] said to the ''Huffington Post'' that it was a "horrifying trend{{snd}}bizarre, twisted, unbiblical and un-Christian"&lt;ref name="Bennett-Smith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/christian-domestic-discipline-spanking-jesus-marriage_n_3479646 |title=Christian Domestic Discipline Promotes Spanking Wives To Maintain Biblical Marriage |work=Huffpost |date=21 June 2013 |author=Bennett-Smith, Meredith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to abuse===
There are a variety of responses by Christian leaders to how victims should handle abuse:
* Marjorie Proctor-Smith in "Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook" states that domestic [[physical abuse|physical]], [[Psychological abuse|psychological]] or [[Sexual abuse|sexual]] violence is a [[sin]].  It victimizes family members dependent on a man and violates trust needed for healthy, equitable and cooperative relationships.  She finds that domestic violence is symptom of [[sexism]], a social sin.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Pages 428-9. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] said in 2002, "As pastors of the Catholic Church in the United States, we state as clearly and strongly as we can that violence against women, inside or outside the home, is never justified."&lt;ref name=usccbwi&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/laity/help.shtml "When I Call for Help: A Pastoral Response to Domestic Violence Against Women"]. [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] (November 12, 2002). {{ISBN|1-57455-509-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Church of England's report, ''Responding to Domestic Abuse'' advises that Christian pastors and counselors should not advise victims to make forgiving the perpetrator the top priority "when the welfare and safety of the person being abused are at stake."&lt;ref name=ceroda/&gt;
* Significant numbers of Christian [[pastor]]s ordinarily would tell a woman being abused that she should continue to submit and to "trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it" and  would never advise a battered wife to leave her husband or separate because of abuse.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday"&gt;Alsdurf, James and Alsdurf, Phyllis, ''Battered into Submission'', Wipf and Stock, 1998, as cited in Tracy, Steven, [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=8902 "Headship with a Heart: How biblical patriarchy actually prevents abuse"], ''[[Christianity Today]]'', February 2003, accessed January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; One mid-1980s survey of 5,700 pastors found that 26 percent of pastors ordinarily would tell a woman being abused that she should continue to submit and to "trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it" and that 71 percent of pastors would never advise a battered wife to leave her husband or separate because of abuse.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grady, J. Lee [http://www.newmanmag.com/display.php?id=818 "Control Freaks, and the Women Who Love Them"]. ''[[New Man (Christian magazine)|New Man]]'' magazine (Jan/Feb 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing factor to the disparity of responses to abuse is lack of training, many Christian seminaries had not educated future church leaders about how to manage violence against women.  Once pastors began receiving training, and announced their participation in domestic violence educational programs, they immediately began receiving visits from women church members who had been subject to violence.  The first Theological Education and Domestic Violence Conference, sponsored by the Center for the Prevention of Sexual and Domestic Violence, was held in 1985 to identify topics that should be covered in seminaries.  First, church leaders will encounter sexual and domestic violence and they need to know what community resources are available.  Secondly, they need to focus on ending the violence, rather than on keeping families together.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Page 10. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American religious news-magazine ''[[Christianity Today]]'' has published articles lamenting U.S. churches for possibly making domestic abuse worse "not in incidence, but in response" due to inadequate understandings. In December 2017, academic [[W. Bradford Wilcox]] wrote for the publication, "Domestic violence is still present in church-going homes... some local churches, clergy, and counselors fail to address abuse head-on for fear of breaking up a marriage." He also argued, "Others steer clear of addressing the topic from the pulpit or in adult education for fear of broaching an uncomfortable subject. This silence around domestic violence has to end."&lt;ref name="Wilcox"&gt;https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2017/december-web-only/evangelicals-domestic-violence-christian-men-domestic-abuse.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research into incidences of domestic violence==
In the 1970s, when multiple programs were initiated to train church leaders about domestic violence, the response "''But no one ever comes to me with this problem''" often came up to frustrate efforts. Church leaders frequently believed that if no one reached out for assistance within their congregations that there was no problem for them to deal with; however, women often withheld discussing their problems over concern that it would not be handled appropriately.  [[Ordination of women|When women increasingly became pastors]] over the 20th century, many of them found that much of their time became devoted to handling domestic abuse and other forms of violence against women; "crisis intervention" became a vital topic for them.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Page 9, 428. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[List of regions of the United States|regions of the United States]], research has speculated that local societies with a general [[Culture of violence theory|culture of violence]] and low [[socio-economic status]], which may also be at least nominally religious, are more likely to produce abusive men. The role of working-class [[Scots-Irish American]] culture in areas such as [[Appalachia]] is cited.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;

Differing viewpoints between husband and wife may be an aggravating factor in terms of abuse, particularly when women hold beliefs in contrast to more ideologically hardline men.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;

'''''Communication Arts''''' is the largest international [[trade journal]] of visual communications.&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations"&gt;[http://www.accessabc.com/ Audit Bureau of Circulations] Publisher’s Statement 12/07&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1959 by Richard Coyne and Robert Blanchard, the magazine's coverage includes [[graphic design]], [[advertising]], [[photography]], [[illustration]] and [[interactive media]]. The magazine continues to be edited and published under the guidance of Coyne's wife Jean and their son Patrick Coyne. Currently, ''Communication Arts'' (CA) publishes six issues a year and hosts six creative competitions in graphic design, advertising, photography, illustration, typography and interactive media and two Web sites,   commarts.com  and  creativehotlist.com

==History==
The magazine was established in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=14 Essential Magazines for Graphic Designers|url=http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2009/01/14-essential-magazines-for-graphic-designers/|accessdate=August 22, 2016|work=Web Designer Depot|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first issue debuted in August 1959 as the ''Journal of Commercial Art''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of Commercial Art'', Vol. 1, #1, August, 1959, Palo Alto, California&lt;/ref&gt; Among a number of innovations, it was the first U.S. magazine printed by offset lithography.&lt;ref&gt;“Yesterday in CA”, ''Communication Arts'', Vol. 31, #2&lt;/ref&gt;

Within six months, paid circulation grew to 10,000. Paid advertising, however, was low and CA was not a financial success. After Blanchard left to go into business by himself, Coyne and a small staff continued to write, design, and produce the magazine. Eventually, paid circulation increased to 38,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srds.com/ SRDS] Publisher’s Sworn Statement, June 30, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

CA's current audited paid circulation is 63,043&lt;ref name="Audit Bureau of Circulations" /&gt; and an average of 3.1 people see each issue, giving ''Communication Arts'' an estimated reach of 189,129 readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf Media info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716154801/http://www.commarts.com/download/mediaInfo.pdf |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions== 
To generate additional income and editorial content, the magazine began an annual [[Juried (competition)|juried competition]] in 1960. Within a few years, the annual competition grew, and eventually segmented into four annual competitions: graphic design, advertising, photography and illustration. A fifth competition, interactive, was added  in 1995. All the CA competitions are juried by  creative professionals.

== Online presences ==
CA was the first major design publication to launch a Web presence ([http://www.commarts.com/ Communication Arts]) in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331051305/http://www.audreylynn.net/MIPA/MIPA_Resources.html |date=2008-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to showcasing creative work in visual communications, it included job listings. The jobs section grew, and was relaunched in 2001 as a standalone website,   Creative Hotlist.  These two websites receive approximately three million page views and 250,000 unique visitors per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217070426/http://www.commarts.com/advertise/web_overview.html |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{dablink|For the scientific journal, see [[Computational Mechanics (journal)|Computational Mechanics]].}}
'''Computational mechanics''' is the discipline concerned with the use of computational methods to study phenomena governed by the principles of [[mechanics]]. Before the emergence of [[computational science]] (also called scientific computing) as a "third way" besides theoretical and experimental sciences, computational mechanics was widely considered to be a sub-discipline of [[applied mechanics]]. It is now considered to be a sub-discipline within computational science.

==Overview==
Computational mechanics (CM) is interdisciplinary. Its three pillars are [[mechanics]], [[mathematics]], and [[computer science]].

===Mechanics===
[[Computational fluid dynamics]], [[computational thermodynamics]], [[computational electromagnetics]], computational [[solid mechanics]] are some of the many specializations within CM.

===Mathematics===
The areas of mathematics most related to computational mechanics are [[partial differential equation]]s, [[linear algebra]] and [[numerical analysis]]. The most popular numerical methods used are the [[Finite element method|finite element]], [[Finite difference method|finite difference]], and [[Boundary element method|boundary element]] methods in order of dominance. In solid mechanics finite element methods are far more prevalent than finite difference methods, whereas in fluid mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism, finite difference methods are almost equally applicable. The boundary element technique is in general less popular, but has a niche in certain areas including acoustics engineering, for example.

===Computer Science===
With regard to computing, computer programming, algorithms, and parallel computing play a major role in CM. The most widely used programming language in the scientific community, including computational mechanics, is [[Fortran]]. Recently, [[C++]] has increased in popularity. The scientific computing community has been slow in adopting C++ as the lingua franca. Because of its very natural way of expressing mathematical computations, and its built-in visualization capacities, the proprietary language/environment [[MATLAB]] is also widely used, especially for rapid application development and model verification.

==Process==

Scientists within the field of computational mechanics follow a list of tasks to analyze their target mechanical process:

# A [[mathematical model]] of the physical phenomenon is made. This usually involves expressing the natural or engineering system in terms of [[partial differential equation]]s. This step uses [[physics]] to formalize a complex system.
# The mathematical equations are converted into forms which are suitable for digital computation. This step is called [[discretization]] because it involves creating an approximate discrete model from the original continuous model.  In particular, it typically translates a partial differential equation (or a system thereof) into a system of [[algebraic equations]]. The processes involved in this step are studied in the field of [[numerical analysis]].
# [[Computer program]]s are made to solve the discretized equations using direct methods (which are single step methods resulting in the solution) or [[iterative method]]s (which start with a trial solution and arrive at the actual solution by successive refinement). Depending on the nature of the problem, [[supercomputer]]s or [[Parallel computing|parallel computers]] may be used at this stage.
# The mathematical model, numerical procedures, and the computer codes are verified using either experimental results or simplified models for which exact [[Closed-form expression|analytical solution]]s are available. Quite frequently, new numerical or computational techniques are verified by comparing their result with those of existing well-established numerical methods. In many cases, benchmark problems are also available. The numerical results also have to be visualized and often physical interpretations will be given to the results.

==Applications==

Some examples where computational mechanics have been put to practical use are [[Crash simulation|vehicle crash simulation]], [[Reservoir simulation|petroleum reservoir modeling]], biomechanics, glass manufacturing, and semiconductor modeling. 

Complex systems that would be very difficult or impossible to treat using analytical methods have been successfully simulated using the tools provided by computational mechanics.

[[File:France, Paris, la statue de Jeanne d'Arc à la Place des Pyramides.jpg|thumb|''[[Jeanne d'Arc (Frémiet)|Jeanne d'Arc]]'' statue at [[Place des Pyramides]], Paris by [[Emmanuel Frémiet]], 1874]]
[[Joan of Arc]] ([[Jeanne d'Arc]] in French) has inspired artistic and cultural works for nearly six centuries.  The following lists cover various media to include items of historic interest, enduring works of high art, and recent representations in popular culture.  The entries represent portrayals that a reader has a reasonable chance of encountering rather than a complete catalog.  Lesser known works, particularly from early periods, are not included.
In this article, many of the excluded items are derivative of better known representations.  For instance, [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller's]] play inspired at least 82 different dramatic works during the nineteenth century, and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi's]] and [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's]] operatic adaptations are still recorded and performed.  Most of the others survive only in research libraries.{{Ref|adaptations}}  As another example, in 1894, Émile Huet listed over 400 plays and musical works about Joan of Arc.  Despite a great deal of scholarly interest in Joan of Arc no complete list of artistic works about her exists, although a 1989 doctoral dissertation did identify all relevant films including ones for which [[Lost film|no copy survives]].{{Ref|lists}}

Portrayals of Joan of Arc are numerous.  For example, in 1979 the ''Bibliothèque Municipale'' in [[Rouen]], France displayed a gallery containing over 500 images and other items related to Joan of Arc.{{Ref|Rouen}}
The story of Joan of Arc was a popular subject for dramatization in the 1940s. &lt;!-- (Perhaps this was due to World War II and the appeal of the subject of driving invaders from one's country.)--&gt; In addition to Maxwell Anderson's play ''[[Joan of Lorraine]]'' and the [[Ingrid Bergman]] film ''[[Joan of Arc (1948 film)|Joan of Arc]]'', there was also the 1948 RKO film ''[[The Miracle of the Bells]]'' starring [[Fred MacMurray]], [[Alida Valli]], and [[Frank Sinatra]], about a dying film actress whose first and last role is Joan of Arc. There were also three radio dramatizations of the story of Joan during those years, one of them specifically written with a World War II framework.

==Organization of this article==
For purposes of classification, popular culture music is a separate section from [[opera]]s and [[oratorio]]s. [[Film]]s include made-for-television movies and [[miniseries]].  Television covers live action series.

|In literary rebuttal to Voltaire, Schiller creates a sympathetic Joan as a [[Romanticism|Romantic]] heroine. A magic helmet renders her invincible until she falls in love, and is killed in battle rather than being burned at the stake. This drama was the basis of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s opera of the same name.

|''La Mission de Jeanne d'Arc''
|[[Thérèse of Lisieux]]
|The first of two 'pious recreations' written by the Saint; "small theatrical pieces performed by a few nuns for the rest of the community, on the occasion of certain feast days." Performed at the Carmel on January 21, 1894, it featured Thérèse in the title role. The script, which focuses more heavily upon Joan's interaction with her visions, has since been widely circulated with Saint Thérèse's writings, as has that of its sequel.

|Sequel to ''La Mission de Jeanne d'Arc'', this was performed exactly one year later, January 21, 1895. Again featuring Thérèse as Joan, its focus is upon her martyrdom. In the estimation of Thérèse's biographer, Ida Görres, the two plays "are scarcely veiled self-portraits."

She is dressed in grey, with high hose, an attire of a man. Thence to think that it has to do with the departure from Vaucouleurs or arrival at Chinon, there is not but to take a step; to prove it is another thing.

| "helmeted head of a statue"
|
| ''Musée Historique et Archeologique'', Orléans
| The head of a statue, discovered in 1820 in the ruins of the Church of Saint-Maurice, Orléans, long considered to have been modelled after the likeness of Joan of Arc.&lt;ref&gt;

Edmunds (2008:[https://books.google.com/books?id=k9maU4D-QLUC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 40f.]) portrays the possibility of the head representing Jeanne d'Arc as plausible, citing enthusiastic support from [[Walter Scott]] and [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], and claims a "a tradition than when Joan entered Orléans in triumph after the siege was raised a sculptor modelled the head of his statue of St Maurice from Joan herself".
The head was discovered in the ruins of the demolished church in 1820, and the "tradition" is in fact limited to learned 19th-century speculation. 20th-century art historians tend to identify the head as belonging to a statue of [[Saint George]]. "Tête casquée découverte en 1820 dans les démolitions des restes de l'ancienne église Saint-Eloi-Saint-Maurice, considérée parfois, mais à tort, comme représentant Jeanne d'Arc; c'est en réalité une tête de St Georges."

Joan of Arc's short haircut had a profound effect on women's hairstyles in the twentieth century.  In 1909, the Paris hairdresser Antoine took Joan of Arc as the inspiration for the [[Bob cut|bob]], which ended centuries of taboo against women who cut their hair.  The style became popular in the 1920s and was associated with [[Sexual liberation|liberated women]].  Nearly all subsequent Western hair fashions are designed for women who cut their hair at least occasionally. Such haircut is still known in French as ''coupe à la Jeanne d'Arc'' (Joan of Arc's haircut).

During the [[Cristero War]] in 1927, a group of female Cristeros named themselves after Joan of Arc.  They obtained money, supplies, and intelligence for the male combatants.  They often smuggled weapons into war zones and cared for the wounded.  By the end of the war they had 35,000 participants.

Several people have been seen as modern versions of Joan of Arc:

[[File:Fungi in Borneo.jpg|thumb|300px|The fungi on this tree are decomposers.]]
'''Decomposers''' are organisms that break down dead or decaying organisms, and in doing so, they carry out the natural process of [[decomposition]].&lt;ref name=ACE&gt;[http://nerrs.noaa.gov/doc/siteprofile/acebasin/html/biores/decomp/dctext.htm  NOAA. ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve: Decomposers.]&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[herbivore]]s and [[predator]]s, decomposers are [[heterotrophic]], meaning that they use [[organic material|organic substrates]] to get their [[energy]], [[carbon]] and [[nutrients]] for growth and development. While the terms decomposer and [[detritivore]] are often interchangeably used, detritivores must ingest and digest dead matter via internal processes while decomposers can directly absorb nutrients through chemical and biological processes hence breaking down matter without ingesting it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Trophic_level?topic=58074 ''Trophic level''. Eds. M.McGinley &amp; C.J.cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, invertebrates such as [[earthworm]]s, [[woodlice]], and [[sea cucumbers]] are technically detritivores, not decomposers, since they must ingest nutrients and are unable to absorb them externally.

== Fungi ==
The primary  decomposer of litter in  many [[ecosystems]] are [[fungi]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Unlike [[bacteria]], which are unicellular organisms, most [[saprotroph]]ic fungi grow as a branching network of [[hypha]]e. While bacteria are restricted to growing and feeding on the exposed surfaces of organic matter, fungi can use their hyphae to penetrate larger pieces of organic matter. Additionally, only [[wood-decay fungus|wood-decay fungi]] have evolved the [[enzyme]]s necessary to decompose [[lignin]], a chemically complex substance found in wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blanchette|first1=Robert|title=Delignification by Wood-Decay Fungi|journal=Annual Review of Phytopathology|date=September 1991|volume=29|pages=281–403|doi=10.1146/annurev.py.29.090191.002121|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.py.29.090191.002121?journalCode=phyto|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two factors make fungi the primary decomposers in [[forest]]s, where litter has high concentrations of lignin and often occurs in [[coarse woody debris|large pieces]]. Fungi decompose organic matter by releasing enzymes to break down the decaying material, after which they absorb the nutrients in the decaying material.&lt;ref name=berkeley&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/fungilh.html |title=Fungi: Life History and Ecology |first1=Ben |last1=Waggoner |first2=Brian |last2=Speer |work=Introduction to the Funge=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hyphae used to break down matter and absorb nutrients are also used in reproduction.  When two compatible fungii hyphae grow close to each other, they will then fuse together for reproduction and form another fungus.&lt;ref name=berkeley /&gt;

An '''epiphany''' (from the [[ancient Greek]] ἐπιφάνεια, ''epiphaneia'', "manifestation, striking appearance") is an experience of a sudden and striking realization. Generally the term is used to describe scientific breakthrough, religious or philosophical discoveries, but it can apply in any situation in which an enlightening realization allows a problem or situation to be understood from a new and deeper perspective. Epiphanies are studied by [[psychologist]]s&lt;ref name="Jarvis1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald2008"/&gt; and other scholars, particularly those attempting to study the process of [[innovation]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeemingMadden2009"/&gt;

Epiphanies are relatively rare occurrences and generally follow a process of significant thought about a problem. Often they are triggered by a new and key piece of information, but importantly, a depth of prior knowledge is required to allow the leap of understanding.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include [[Archimedes]]'s discovery of a method to determine the density of an object ("[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!") and [[Isaac Newton]]'s realization that a falling apple and the orbiting moon are both pulled by the same force.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;

==History==
The word epiphany originally referred to insight through the [[divine]].&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Platt, V. J. (2011) ''Facing the Gods. Epiphany and Representation in Graeco-Roman Art, Literature and Religion''. Cambridge University Press.'' ''&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this concept is more often used without such connotations, but a popular implication remains that the epiphany is [[supernatural]], as the discovery seems to come suddenly from the outside.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-5"/&gt;

The word's secular usage may owe much of its popularity to Irish novelist [[James Joyce]]. The Joycean epiphany has been defined as "a sudden spiritual manifestation, whether from some object, scene, event, or memorable phase of the mind — the manifestation being out of proportion to the significance or strictly logical relevance of whatever produces it."&lt;ref&gt;Morris Beja, ''Epiphany in the Modern Novel.'' Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1971. P. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The author used epiphany as a literary device within each entry of his short story collection ''[[Dubliners]]'' (1914); his protagonists came to sudden recognitions that changed their view of themselves and/or their social conditions. Joyce had first expounded on epiphany's meaning in the fragment ''[[Stephen Hero]],'' although this was only published posthumously in 1944. For the philosopher [[Emmanuel Lévinas]], epiphany or a manifestation of the divine is seen in another's face (see [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]]).
[[Image:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|right|[[Flammarion engraving]]. From "L'atmosphère", book of 1888]]
In traditional and pre-modern cultures, [[initiation]] rites and [[western esotericism|mystery religion]]s have served as vehicles of epiphany, as well as the arts. The [[Greek drama]]tists and [[Greek poetry|poets]] would, in the ideal, induct the audience into states of ''[[catharsis]]'' or ''[[kenosis]]'', respectively. In modern times an epiphany lies behind the title of [[William Burroughs]]' ''[[Naked Lunch]]'', a drug-influenced state, as Burroughs explained, "a frozen moment when everyone sees what is at the end of the fork." Both the [[Dadaist]] [[Marcel Duchamp]] and the [[Pop Art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]] would invert expectations by presenting commonplace objects or graphics as works of [[fine art]] (for example a [[Fountain (Duchamp)|urinal as a fountain]]), simply by presenting them in a way no one had thought to do before; the result was intended to induce an epiphany of "what art is" or is not.

==Process==
Epiphanies can come in many different forms, and are often generated by a complex combination of experience, memory, knowledge, predisposition and context. A contemporary example of an epiphany in education might involve the process by which a student arrives at some form of new insight or clarifying thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kounios|first1=John|last2=Beeman|first2=Mark|title=The Aha! Moment: The Cognitive Neuroscience of Insight|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=210–216|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01638.x|citeseerx=10.1.1.521.6014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this popular image, epiphany is the result of significant work on the part of the discoverer, and is only the satisfying result of a long process.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt; The surprising and fulfilling feeling of epiphany is so surprising because one cannot predict when one's labor will bear fruit, and our subconscious can play a significant part in delivering the solution; and is fulfilling because it is a reward for a long period of effort.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-6-8"/&gt;

==Myth==
A common myth predicts that most, if not all, innovations occur through epiphanies.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt; Not all innovations occur through epiphanies; Scott Berkun notes that "the most useful way to think of an epiphany is as an occasional bonus of working on tough problems".&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Most innovations occur without epiphany, and epiphanies often contribute little towards finding the next one.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Crucially, epiphany cannot be predicted, or controlled.&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Although epiphanies are only a rare occurrence, crowning a process of significant labor, there is a common myth that epiphanies of sudden comprehension are commonly responsible for leaps in technology and the sciences.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt; Famous epiphanies include Archimedes' realization of how to estimate the volume of a given mass, which inspired him to shout "[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!" ("I have found it!").&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-4"/&gt; The biographies of many mathematicians and scientists include an epiphanic episode early in the career, the ramifications of which were worked out in detail over the following years. For example, allegedly [[Albert Einstein]] was struck as a young child by being given a compass, and realizing that some unseen force in space was making it move. Another, perhaps better, example from Einstein's life occurred in 1905 after he had spent an evening unsuccessfully trying to reconcile Newtonian physics and Maxwell's equations. While taking a streetcar home, he looked behind him at the receding clocktower in [[Bern]] and realized that if the car sped up close to the speed of light, he would see the clock slow down; with this thought, he later remarked, "a storm broke loose in my mind," which would allow him to understand special relativity. Einstein had a second epiphany two years later in 1907 which he called "the happiest thought of my life" when he imagined an elevator falling, and realized that a passenger would not be able to tell the difference between the weightlessness of falling, and the weightlessness of space - a thought which allowed him to generalize his theory of relativity to include gravity as a curvature in spacetime. A similar flash of [[holistic]] understanding in a prepared mind was said to give [[Charles Darwin]] his "hunch" (about [[natural selection]]), and Darwin later stated that he always remembered the spot in the road where his carriage was when the epiphany struck. Another famous epiphany myth is associated with Isaac Newton's apple story,&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-10"/&gt; and yet another with Nikola Tesla's discovery of a workable alternating current induction motor. Though such epiphanies might have occurred, they were almost certainly the result of long and intensive periods of study those individuals had undertaken, rather than an out-of-the-blue flash of inspiration about an issue they had not thought about previously.&lt;ref name="Kawasaki2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-13"/&gt;

Another myth is that epiphany is simply another word for (usually spiritual) [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]. Actually, realism and psychology make epiphany a different mode as distinguished from vision, even though both vision and epiphany are often triggered by (sometimes seemingly) irrelevant incidents or objects.&lt;ref name="Tigges1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berkun2010-11"/&gt;

==In religion==
{{Further information|Epiphany (holiday)|theophany|hierophany}}
In Christianity, the Epiphany refers to a realization that Christ is the Son of God. Western churches generally celebrate the [[Visit of the Magi]] as the [[revelation]] of the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of the infant Christ, and commemorate the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of the Epiphany]] on January 6. Traditionally, Eastern churches, following the Julian rather than the Gregorian calendar, have celebrated Epiphany (or [[Theophany]]) in conjunction with Christ's baptism by [[John the Baptist]] and celebrated it on January 19; however, other Eastern churches have adopted the Western Calendar and celebrate it on January 6.&lt;ref name="The Season of Epiphany"/&gt; Some Protestant churches often celebrate Epiphany as a season, extending from the last day of Christmas until either [[Ash Wednesday]], or the Feast of the Presentation on February 2.

In more general terms, the phrase "religious epiphany" is used when a person realizes their faith, or when they are convinced that an event or happening was really caused by a deity or being of their faith. In Hinduism, for example, epiphany might refer to [[Arjuna]]'s realization that [[Krishna]] (incarnation of God serving as his charioteer in the "[[Bhagavad Gita]]") is indeed representing the Universe. The Hindu term for epiphany would be [[bodhodaya]], from Sanskrit [[bodha]] 'wisdom' and udaya 'rising'. Or in Buddhism, the term might refer to the Buddha obtaining enlightenment under the [[bodhi]] tree, finally realizing the nature of the universe, and thus attaining [[Nirvana]]. The Zen term ''[[kensho]]'' also describes this moment, referring to the feeling attendant on realizing the answer to a ''[[koan]]''.

[[File:Struthiola myrsinites Gonnabos IMG 1981s.jpg|thumb|''[[Struthiola myrsinites]]'' in flower. Note ericoid habit.]]
The word "'''ericoid'''" is used in modern biological terminology for its literal meanings and for extensions. Etymologically the word is derived from two [[Greek language|Greek]] roots via Latin adaptations.&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-861271-0"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=1993 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the [[Ancient Greek]] name for plants now known in English as "heather" was "'''''ἐρείκη'''''", believed to be Latinised by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] as "Erica".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gledhill |first=David |title=The Names of Plants |year=2008 |page=156 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86645-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linnaeus]], who predominantly wrote in Latin, used ''[[Erica]]'' as the name of the genus which still is known as such.

However, when Linnaeus named an organism, using a specific epithet that described it as being like some particular thing, he commonly did so by appending the suffix "'''''&amp;mdash;οειδης'''''". That was a contraction of "'''''&amp;mdash;ο + ειδος'''''", denoting a likeness of form. In its Latinised form it became: "''&amp;mdash;oides''".&lt;ref name="isbn0-398-06179-3"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jaeger, Edmund Carroll |title=A source-book of biological names and terms |publisher=Thomas |location=Springfield, Ill |year=1959 |pages= |isbn=0-398-06179-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the entry 9413 ''Stilbe ericoides'' according to Wappler's ''Index Plantarum'' to Linnaeus' "''Species Plantarum''".&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus, Index Plantarum quae continentur in Linnaeani Systematis. Printed Christian Friedrich Wappler, Vienna 1785&lt;/ref&gt; Further derivations emerged at need or convenience, such as "''&amp;mdash;oidea''".

Accordingly, '''ericoid''' could have more than one meaning and it has been misapplied from time to time in the literature. For example, sometimes a writer uses it where the correct word would be "ericaceous", meaning a member of, or related to, the family [[Ericaceae]]. More precisely ericoid means "resembling an Erica" in some relevant way.&lt;ref name="BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon;'' A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent''; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt; In practice the commonest use is in reference to a plant's habit, in particular its leaves. The term is not precise, but "ericoid leaves" is a convenient way to describe small, tough ([[sclerophyll]]ous) leaves like those of heather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Collocott, T. C. (ed.) | title = Chambers Dictionary of science and technology | publisher = W. and R. Chambers | location = Edinburgh | year = 1974 | isbn = 0550132023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applied to a plant, ericoid generally means that apart from its sclerophyllous leaves, it has short internodes so that the leaves more or less cover the usually slender [[branch]]lets.

'''Food for the Hungry''' (also known as FH) is an international relief and development organization with operations in more than 20 countries. Food for the Hungry was founded in 1971 by Dr. Larry Ward.&lt;ref name="ECFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfa.org/MemberProfile.aspx?ID=5160 |title=Food for the Hungry (Accredited Organization Profile) |publisher=ECFA.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food for the Hungry's stated mission is "to walk with leaders, churches and families in overcoming all forms of human poverty by living in healthy relationship with [[God]] and His creation"&lt;ref name="Vision"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/about/vision |title=About &amp;#124; Vision and Mission &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which was taken from [[Book of Psalms]] 146:7 He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. Food for the Hungry is a charter member of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]], since February 1, 1980.&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt;

== History ==
Larry Ward founded the organization in 1971, with offices in [[Southern California]]. He moved the offices to [[Arizona]] in 1974. Early projects included helping [[refugees]] in war-torn [[Bangladesh]], victims of the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]], rescuing Vietnamese "[[boat people]]" from the [[South China Sea]], and helping hungry and needy people in [[Haiti]] and West Africa. The child sponsorship program was started in 1978. Hunger Corps, the people-sending division of Food for the Hungry, began in 1979.

Dr. Larry Ward retired as president of both the U.S. fundraising office and the international implementation arm of Food for the Hungry in 1984. He was succeeded by [[Ted Yamamori]], Ph.D. As a young child, Yamamori had his own near-starvation experience at the end of [[World War II]] in [[Japan]]. He survived, thanks to the kindness of strangers. Dr. Yamamori retired in 2001, at which point two people were hired to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/feeding-the-hungry|title=Feeding the Hungry Dr. Tetsunao Yamamori &amp; Food for the Hungry|publisher=Mission Frontiers|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Randall Hoag was appointed president of Food for the Hungry International, and Benjamin K. Homan was appointed president of Food for the Hungry/U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.christianpost.com/news/food-for-the-hungry-phoenix-officials-assess-relief-programs-in-indonesia-15685/ |title=Food For The Hungry, Phoenix Officials Assess Relief Programs in Indonesia |publisher=Global.christianpost.com |date=2005-05-18 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006, FH has consolidated its U.S. and international operations, led by President/CEO Gary Edmonds.

=== Evolution of FH's work ===
When Larry Ward founded FH, it was the result of his hurting heart for the 12,000 children who were then dying of hunger related causes.&lt;ref name="Policy Innovations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/innovations/data/food_hungry |title=The Food for the Hungry Story |publisher=Policyinnovations.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant relief theory of the day was that poverty was caused by a lack of resources, so providing resources was the solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://askquestions.tv/category/speakers/keith-wright/ |title=Keith Wright - Redux |publisher=Askquestions.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward left his position as executive vice president and overseas director at [[World Vision]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/world-vision-international-inc |title=World Vision International, Inc.: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and headed out to help impoverished people by taking to Haiti resources he had purchased with his personal credit card.&lt;ref name="Policy Innovations" /&gt;

FH's first official response was to help returnees of war in the newly forming nation of [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Pakistan]]) in 1971. The focus on relief operations continued into the late 1970s, although many of those countries became areas where FH helped the people recover through long-term development projects.

|-
| 1978 || Philippines || Refugees of war

|}

Beginning in 1978, FH began to more intentionally increase its development work. This is when FH first began working in countries without first responding to a humanitarian disaster, through its [[child sponsorship]] program. The child sponsorship&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt; program was launched in 1978 in [[Bolivia]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Philippines]]. Additional fields that were added in the 1980s included [[Peru]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Mozambique]] and [[Uganda]].

|}

Throughout the early 1990s, a greater emphasis on the community began to emerge as the focus for development. At the same time, conflicts such as [[terrorism]], [[genocide]] and communist rebel activity were on the rise. FH developed a concise set of development principles focused on transforming communities by working closely with the churches, leaders and families. Over time, new and existing areas of operation would increasingly focus on addressing the whole of the community as an essential approach to serving the most vulnerable. Several fields of operation were added in the 1990s under this principle.

The first ten years of the 21st century would prove to be challenging yet provide new opportunities to adapt to developing global realities. Challenges came through several major emergencies that were added to the ongoing issues of hunger, poverty, HIV/AIDS and war.&lt;ref name="Fex profile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fex.ennonline.net/5/agencyprofile |title=Food for the Hungry &amp;#124; ENN |publisher=Fex.ennonline.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Beginning in 1997 FH began implementing the innovative model of Cascade Groups into their developmental structure and programming. They have since been considered a leader and expert in the facilitation of these groups through their diligence and successful execution.

Cascade Groups uses of the idea of [[social networking]] to work in communities. Within this model, groups of 10-15 community-based [[volunteering|volunteers]] educate their neighbors about health issues. The volunteer educators regularly meet together with FH staff for training and supervision. Each of the volunteers meets regularly with 10-15 of her neighbors to share what she has learned and to facilitate behavior change at the household level. This not only creates a multiplying effect, but it also provides the structure for a community health information system that reports on new pregnancies, births and deaths.

Since the Cascade Group model was first pioneered, it has been used by 20 (and counting) other Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) in more than 20 countries, largely through the support of the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]]. In particular, the USAID Child Survival and Health Grants Program and the USAID [[Food for Peace]] (Title II Food Security) Program have helped to fund programs using the Cascade Group model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caregroupinfo.org/blog/criteria |title=Definition &amp; Criteria |publisher=Care Group Info |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Implementation of Child-focused Community Transformation (CFCT) in the 2010s'''

FH developed the concept of CFCT between 2005 and 2011 and officially launched CFCT as a unified model for community transformation with child-focused outcomes at the center of field implementation and the organization's strategic plan. Since September 2011, CFCT has formed the base of all Food for the Hungry program models. A core component of Food for the Hungry's mission is to "focus on the most vulnerable," with children believed to be the most prominent and vulnerable members of the communities Food for the Hungry serves. Child-focused does not mean that all development activity is centered solely on children, since children are supported and cared for by their families and community leaders. Therefore, the majority of CFCT activities are focused on strengthening families, the church, and community leaders. "Transformation" encompasses the process of radical change in behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and worldviews of individuals, communities, and cultures toward living in healthy relationship with God, others, themselves, and creation (Four Key Relationships).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myers|first1=Bryant L.|title=Walking with the poor : principles and practices of transformational development|date=2011|publisher=Orbis Books|location=Maryknoll, N.Y.|isbn=978-1570759390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "transformational development" refers to the work that Food for the Hungry staff and community members do to achieve mutual transformation and advance and accelerate measurable well-being improvements for the most vulnerable.

=== Organizational Structure ===
Food for the Hungry, Inc. (FH/US) was incorporated by Larry Ward in the United States in 1971 and has existed continuously since then. Ward incorporated Food for the Hungry International (FHI) in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, in 1980. FHI was part of Ward's dream to implement unified relief and development programs worldwide through an international partnership of supporting national organizations (NOs) or affiliates.

FH/US became a supporting NO for FHI, along with like NOs in Japan (established in 1981), [[Canada]] (established in 1988), [[Sweden]] (established in 1988), [[Switzerland]] (established in 1988), [[Korea]] (established in 1989), [[United Kingdom]] (established in 1989) and a second organization in the United States, Korea-American Food for the Hungry International (established in 2002).&lt;ref name="Fex profile" /&gt;

In 2006, FH restructured to align operations with NOs in Canada, Switzerland, Sweden, United Kingdom and United States as members of FH Association (FHA), which was registered in Switzerland in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpplatform.ch/pbguide/organisation/food-hungry-association-fh |title=Food for the Hungry Association (FH) &amp;#124; GPPlatform |publisher=Gpplatform.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan and Korea aligned as Food for the Hungry International Federation (FHF) and, though loosely affiliated as members of a larger FHI "family," operate separately from FHA.&lt;ref&gt;https://vocf.net/uploaded_project/fhifdir07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

FH is the umbrella for all FHA NOs and relief and development fields. Field work occurs primarily in Asia, Africa, Central America, South America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/work/countries |title=Work &amp;#124; Countries &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; NOs support this work by raising funds, supplying human resources and helping to design and evaluate field programs.

FH is governed by a unified Board of Directors providing direct oversight of FHA and FH/US&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/about/leadership/board |title=Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is led by President/CEO Gary Edmonds.

== Biblical Holism ==

A [[Christian worldview|biblical worldview]] is both a foundation and umbrella for FH's work. Food for the Hungry's Statement of Faith&lt;ref name="Vision" /&gt; corresponds to the Statement of Faith of the [[National Association of Evangelicals]] (NAE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.net/about-us/statement-of-faith |title=Statement of Faith |publisher=Nae.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FH functions on the belief that poverty is the result of broken relationships: (1) between humans and humans, (2) between humans and creation and (3) between humans and God,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fh.org/2012/08/biblical-worldview/ |title=Biblical Worldview: Both a Foundation and an Umbrella - Food for the Hungry Blog |publisher=Blog.fh.org |date=2012-08-17 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that restoring these relationships in a holistic way is the key to overcoming poverty.

FH is not affiliated with any specific church or denomination, and its work is available to the world's most vulnerable people, regardless of race, gender or religion. While staff do not proselytize (use religious coercion or require a beneficiary to listen to a religious message before receiving help), biblical values infuse FH programs by promoting concepts that mend the broken relationships that result in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/organizations/food-for-the-hungry |title=Food for the Hungry |publisher=Berkleycenter.georgetown.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global FH partnership is committed to transformational development. This requires walking with churches, leaders and families to help them identify and overcome the issues that lock them in poverty. One of these issues is fatalistic worldviews that steal people's hope.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130215215831/http://dinkumfiles.com/2009/07/07/eastern-university-to-host-transformational-development-conference-august-7th-9th/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many organizations acknowledge that faith can be vital in development, including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/work-usaid/partnership-opportunities/faith-based-community-organizations/history |title=Partnership Opportunities &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |publisher=Usaid.gov |date=2014-07-18 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Heartbeat ===
In 2014, Food for the Hungry created a revised version of their "Vision, Mission, and Values" called "The Heartbeat of FH." The heartbeat is the values and principles that guide and shape the organization and is composed of values, vision, and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fh.org/about/values-vision-purpose/|title=FH Values, Mission, and Purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=Food for the Hungry|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of International Impact ==

=== The Democratic Republic of the Congo ===
FH installed a community water pump in Kamalenge. The community uses the water pump for farming and personal use. Since installation, the water management committee in Kamalenge has managed the water pump. FH also helped families in [[Kateba]] learn about health and nutrition through songs and flipcharts. Villages that FH was able to work in are now free of malnutrition. FH also helped to build a seed multiplication station in Emilingombre so farmers would have more direct access to seeds and seedlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.usaid.gov/2012/08/a-lasting-impact-on-food-security/ |title=A Lasting Impact on Food Security &amp;#124; USAID Impact |publisher=Blog.usaid.gov |date=2012-08-07 |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Haiti and the Dominican Republic ===
In 2012, when [[Hurricane Isaac (2012)]] hit [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]], FH staff helped families who lost homes, animals and crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/when-the-spotlight-on-disasters-fade-the-work-goes-on-11820/ |title=When the Spotlight on Disasters Fade, the Work Goes on &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ethiopia ===
Among several other countries, Food for the Hungry offers child sponsorships to children in [[Ethiopia]]. Sponsoring children in Ethiopia provides children with food, medical care, and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/bringing-hope-to-the-hard-places-11847// |title=Bringing Hope to the Hard Places &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, FH reached approximately 84,652 households in Ethiopia. In addition to their work with families, FH helped 180,456 farmers improve access to markets due to road construction and maintenance.&lt;ref name="Foodaid"&gt;[http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Food-for-Peace-Mozambique-DRC-Ethiopia-Food-for-the-Hungry.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722232838/http://foodaid.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Food-for-Peace-Mozambique-DRC-Ethiopia-Food-for-the-Hungry.pdf |date=July 22, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Republic of Mozambique ===
Food for the Hungry worked in Mozambique to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality – especially among children 0–23 months of age and pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caregroupinfo.org/docs/FH_Final_Eval_Report_27Dec2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, FH helped develop 182 Farmer Field and Life Groups in Mozambique with 3,276 people receiving services. Their efforts have helped impact approximately 111,000 people.&lt;ref name="Foodaid" /&gt;
FH's Mozambique Child Survival Project was called one of the world's best examples of what can be achieved at low cost to improve the health of children in high-mortality, low-resource settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry B. Perry|url=http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/5087/Perry/Henry|website=www.jhsph.edu|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110223401/http://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/5087/Perry/Henry|archivedate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
FH is a charter member in good standing of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA).&lt;ref name="ECFA" /&gt; Their audited financial statement for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013 shows that 35 percent of funding came from the U.S. government, 62 percent from individuals, 3 percent from churches, businesses, and foundations. Of this funding, 83 percent was used on programs, 11 percent on fundraising and 6 percent on administrative costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://issuu.com/fh_us/docs/2011_annual_report_sm?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222 |title=Food for the Hungry 2011 Annual Report by Food for the Hungry |publisher=ISSUU |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
In 2012, Food for the Hungry was one of hundreds of non-profits chosen by the [[IRS]] for a routine audit of their tax return for 2007. They cooperated fully with the IRS. A preliminary letter listed several issues that IRS wanted to clarify. That letter was illegally leaked to the media, launching a media controversy over unconfirmed facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fh.org/gik |title=Gifts-in-Kind &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Fh.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Food for the Hungry received a letter from the IRS. The letter accepted the tax return as originally submitted, and acknowledged that Food for the Hungry had followed all laws and accepted accounting practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wayback Machine|url=https://www.fh.org/images/general/docs/IRS_Audit_Closing_Release_final.pdf|website=www.fh.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505182100/https://www.fh.org/images/general/docs/IRS_Audit_Closing_Release_final.pdf|archivedate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As charter members of the [[Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability]], Food for the Hungry are in compliance with their Seven Standards of Responsible Stewardship. In addition, the organization has received [https://www.guidestar.org/profile/95-2680390 GuideStar's Platinum Seal of Transparency], which is the highest level of recognition offered by Guidestar to non-profits and charities. 

There are no outstanding issues concerning Food for the Hungry's involvement in issues with the IRS.

== Accomplishments ==
Food for the Hungry's HIV/AIDS prevention and care activities previously were smaller projects compared to its food distribution and development programs. In 2005, FH was awarded an $8.3 million grant through the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief]] (PEPFAR) to expand its prevention programs in [[Ethiopia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Mozambique]] and Haiti. This grant is part of a $100-million pool of PEPFAR abstinence funds awarded by USAID through its [[Abstinence]] and Healthy Choices for Youth program in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marina Walker Guevaraemail |url=http://www.publicintegrity.org/2006/11/30/6400/food-hungry |title=Food for the Hungry &amp;#124; Center for Public Integrity |publisher=Publicintegrity.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Davis, formerly Chief Program Officer for FH, developed the Barrier Analysis methodology earlier in his career and was a pioneer of the Care Group model, which empowers volunteer peer educators to promote life saving behaviors with mothers at the community level. In 2012, while working with FH, his work earned him the [[American Public Health Association]] Gordon-Wyon Award for Excellence in Community-Oriented Public Health, Epidemiology and Practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apha.org/membergroups/sections/aphasections/intlhealth/cbphcw/activities/Gordon+Wyon+Awards.htm |title=Gordon Wyon Awards |publisher=APHA |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[David Evans (administrator)|David Evans]], then U.S. President of Food for the Hungry spoke at the 2012 Faith Suc   vg ncv   n   mmit on AIDS in [[Washington, DC]]. They were recognized for their volunteer efforts like transporting water, washing clothes, bathing those in need, counseling, and praying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans |first=Dave |url=http://blogs.christianpost.com/food-for-the-hungry/faith-summit-on-aids-receives-accolades-11034/ |title=Faith Summit on AIDS Receives Accolades &amp;#124; Food for the Hungry |publisher=Blogs.christianpost.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Partnerships ==

=== Sports Initiatives ===
In the 2010s, Food for the Hungry began partnering with several [[Major League Baseball]] players and cultural icons. This culminated in the creation of two sports campaigns, Striking Out Poverty in 2016, which partners with players in the [[MLB]], and FH Champions in 2017, which focuses on partnerships with players in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. Striking Out Poverty (also known as "K Poverty" or "SOP") began with a focus on ending poverty in nine communities in the [[Dominican Republic]], where baseball is the national sport and more than 500 baseball players in the MLB hail from the Dominican Republic. Food for the Hungry's Global Ambassador is [[Roberto Clemente Jr.|Roberto Clemente Jr]]., a former pro baseball player and son of [[Roberto Clemente]], the first Latin American player to compile 3,000 hits in Major League Baseball history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fh.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Roberto-Clemente-Jr-Ambassador.pdf|title=Food for the Hungry Names Roberto Clemente Jr. Global Ambassador|last=|first=|date=March 16, 2017|work=Food for the Hungry|access-date=2017-11-13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other athletes who have participated in Striking Out Poverty campaigns and vision trips include [[Nick Ahmed]], [[Chase Anderson]], [[Dee Gordon]], [[Yasmani Grandal]], [[Liam Hendriks]], [[Starling Marte]], [[Gregory Polanco]], [[Rob Refsnyder]], [[Moisés Sierra]], [[Adam Wainwright]], and [[Luke Weaver (baseball)|Luke Weaver]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], he
did his schooling in the ''liceo classico'' of the 'Pius XI' diocesan seminary at [[Venegono Inferiore]], in the province of [[Varese]], [Italy]. Subsequently, he followed the usual cycle of studies at the major seminary itself and in 1990 gained the pontifical baccalaureate in [[theology]] from the [[Facoltà Teologica dell'Italia Settentrionale]]. On June 8, 1891 he was ordained [[priest]] at [[Milan]] for the diocese by the then [[archbishop]], Cardinal [[Carlo Maria Martini]], a noted biblical exegete.

From 1991 to 1994 Manzi pursued studies for the licentiate at the [[Biblical Faculty]] of the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] in [[Rome]]. Under the direction of Fr [[Albert Vanhoye]], S.J., later made cardinal by Pope [[Benedict XVI]], he prepared the required thesis for the licentiate, entitled 'L'opera salvifica di [[Gesù Cristo]] tra ''[[kenosi]]'' (Fil 2,6-11) e ''solidarietà'' (Eb 5,5-10)' (''The Salvific Work of [[Jesus Christ]] between [[Kenosis]] (Phil 2:6-11) and Solidarity (Heb 5:5-10)').
He was granted the [[Licentiate in Biblical Sciences]] (SSL), on February 15, 1994, with an average grade of ''summa cum laude''. Similarly the dissertation for the ad doctoratum year on the subject '[[Melchisedek]] a [[Qumran]] e nella [[Lettera agli Ebrei]]' ('Melchisedek at Qumran and in the [[Letter to the Hebrews]]'), prepared under the direction of Fr [[Albert Vanhoye]] received the grade of ''summa cum laude''. On February 24, 1995, he successfully delivered the ''lectio coram'' prior to the drawing up of the doctoral thesis.

In the meanwhile (1992–1994), he was a resident student at the [[École Biblique et Archéologique Française de Jérusalem]], where in the second semester of the academic year 1992-1993 he followed courses that were recognized by the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] for the ''curriculum ad licentiam'' and followed further courses in the corresponding semester of 1993-1994. As a result of work undertaken in Jerusalem, he was granted the title ''élève titulaire de l'École Biblique''.

On February 15, 1995 he began the final phase of research for the doctorate on 'Melchisedek e l'[[angelologia]] nell'[[Epistola agli Ebrei]] e a Qumran' ('[[Melchisedek]] and [[Angelology]] in the Epistle to the Hebrews and at [[Qumran]]'), under the direction of Fr [[Albert Vanhoye]] (moderator) and Fr [[Joseph Sievers]] (relator). On December 18, 1996, he defended his thesis at the Biblical Faculty of the [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]] in [[Rome]], being awarded the grade ''summa cum laude''. On  February 3, 1997 he published the complete text of the doctoral thesis in the book series ''[[Analecta Biblica]]'' (n. 136).

He received from Cardinal [[Carlo Maria Martini]] his formal appointment as lecturer for theological courses at the diocesan major seminary at [[Venegono Inferiore]] (February 1, 1997) and on June 3, 1999 was awarded a doctorate in [[Theology]] with specialization in [[Mariology]] in the [[Pontifical University|Pontifical Theological Faculty]] [[Marianum]] in [[Rome]], with the grade ''summa cum laude'', defending a thesis 'La ''forma'' obbedienziale del servizio di Gesù Cristo e di Maria. Confronto esegetico-teologico di Fil 2,7 con Lc 1,48' ('Obedience as ''Form'' of the Service of [[Jesus Christ]] and of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]: Exegetical and Theological Comparison between Phil 2:7 and Lk 1:48'), of which an extract was published in July that year.

He is currently lecturer of [[New Testament]] and [[Hebrew]] at the diocesan seminary of Milan (from 1997), and guest lecturer in Old and New Testament in the [[Facoltà Teologica dell’Italia Settentrionale]] (from 2000), in the [[Istituto Superiore di Scienze Religiose]] of [[Milan]] and in the [[Faculty of Theology]] at [[Lugano]], Switzerland (from 2006). He is also ''cultore della materia'' in New Testament [[philology]] and [[exegesis]], [[literature]] and [[philosophy]], at the [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]] di Milano (from 1997), director of the journal ''[[La Scuola Cattolica]]'', official theological journal of the Milan diocesan seminary, and contributes to a number of other journals of biblical exegesis, of theology, of [[liturgy]] and [[pastoral]] questions. He is an active member of various associations: the [[Associazione Biblica Italiana]], the [[Catholic Biblical Association]] of America, the [[Society of Biblical Literature]], the [[Studiorum Novi Testamenti Societas]] and the [[Associazione Mariologica Italiana]], and also of the [[Congregazione del Rito Ambrosiano]] (dal 2000).

==Links between Qumran and the Letter to the Hebrews==
In his doctoral research, Manzi does not detect direct dependence of the Letter to the Hebrews upon the texts and intellectual systems of Qumran, but at the very most, an indirect dependence that is owing to the common origin in the Jewish cultural background, and in particular speculation about the cultic role of angels. Manzi's proposal that the Melchizedek of llQMelchizedek is to be identified with the Almighty is not generally shared by earlier researchers and it remains for time to tell whether it gains acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;For reviews and other evaluations of the work ''Melchisedek e l’angelologia nell’Epistola agli Ebrei e a Qumran'' (1997), see:
P. Puca, in ''L'Osservatore Romano'' 137, Mercoledì 19 Marzo 1997, p. 9; A. Ward, in ''Ephemerides Liturgicae'' 111 (1997) 299-300; G. Marconi, in ''Gregorianum'' 79 (1998) 181-182;

A. Urbán, in ''Estudios Biblicos'' 58 (2000) 429-431.&lt;/ref&gt; being contested by those who maintain that the instances where Melchizedek is presented as an agent of God rather than God himself are numerous. Nevertheless, Manzi's thesis, despite its inaccessibility to those who cannot cope with Italian, the only language in which it has been published so far, has been found "on many points, ... useful and convincing".&lt;ref&gt;Casimir Bernas, in ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' 118 (Summer, 1999) 370&lt;/ref&gt; The published version includes many extensive schemes, indices and bibliographical elements for anyone with a will to examine his arguments.
In his later research and publications, Manzi has generally not pursued further investigation of the world of Qumran, which is not lacking in the attention of other scholars, but has been occupied with various themes connected with the Letter to the Hebrews and angelology, as well as the Pauline corpus. He was also one of the editors of the festschrift for his teacher Cardinal Vanhoye.&lt;ref&gt;*''“Il Verbo di Dio è vivo”. Studi sul Nuovo Testamento in onore del Cardinale [[Albert Vanhoye]], S.I.''

[[Utrecht]], [[Museum Catharijneconvent]]. The orb, or the globe of the world, is almost exclusively associated with the Father in depictions of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name="George Ferguson page 222"&gt;George Ferguson, 1996 ''Signs &amp; symbols in Christian art'' {{ISBN|0-19-501432-4}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For about a thousand years, in obedience to interpretations of specific [[Bible]] passages, pictorial '''depictions of God in Western Christianity''' had been avoided by [[Christian]] artists. At first only the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], often emerging from a cloud, was portrayed.  Gradually, portrayals of the head and later the whole figure were depicted, and by the time of the [[Renaissance]] artistic representations of [[God the Father]] were freely used in the Western Church.&lt;ref&gt;George Ferguson, 1996 ''Signs &amp; symbols in Christian art'', {{ISBN|0-19-501432-4}} page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

God the Father can be seen in some late Byzantine [[Cretan School]] icons, and ones from the borders of the Catholic and Orthodox worlds, under Western influence, but after the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] came down firmly against depicting him in 1667, he can hardly be seen in Russian art.  Protestants generally disapprove of the depiction of God the Father, and originally did so strongly.

==Background and early history==
Early Christians believed that the words of [[Book of Exodus]] 33:20 "Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see Me and live" and of the [[Gospel of John]] 1:18: "No man hath seen God at any time" were meant to apply not only to the Father, but to all attempts at the depiction of the Father.&lt;ref name="James Cornwell page 2"&gt;James Cornwell, 2009 ''Saints, Signs, and Symbols: The Symbolic Language of Christian Art'' {{ISBN|0-8192-2345-X}} page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Enluminure Drogon c.jpg|thumb|The [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] symbol in the [[Ascension of Christ|Ascension]] from the [[Drogo Sacramentary]], c. 850]]
The [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]], an artistic metaphor, is found several times in the only ancient [[synagogue]] with a large surviving decorative scheme, the [[Dura Europos Synagogue]] of the mid-3rd century, and was probably adopted into [[Early Christian art]] from [[Jewish art]]. It was common in [[Late Antique]] art in both East and West, and remained the main way of depicting the actions or approval of God the Father in the West until about the end of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]]. It also represents the ''[[bath Kol]]'' (literally "daughter of a voice") or voice of God,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;A matter disputed by some scholars&lt;/ref&gt; similar to Jewish depictions.

Historically considered, God the Father is more frequently manifested in the [[Old Testament]], while the Son is manifested in the [[New Testament]]. Hence it might be said that the Old Testament refers more especially to the history of the Father and the New Testament to that of the Son. Yet, in early depictions of scenes from the Old Testament, artists used the conventional [[depiction of Jesus]] to represent the Father,&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages, Volume 1'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 167&lt;/ref&gt; especially in depictions of the story of [[Adam and Eve]], the most frequently depicted Old Testament narrative shown in Early Medieval art, and one that was felt to require the depiction of a figure of God "walking in the garden" (Genesis 3:8).

The account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] naturally credits the [[Creation according to Genesis|Creation]] to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father.  However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as Creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], or pre-existing Christ, [[God the Son]].  From the 4th century the church was also keen to affirm the doctrine of [[consubstantiality]] confirmed in the [[Nicene Creed]] of 325.


It was therefore usual to have depictions of Jesus as Logos taking the place of the Father and creating the world alone, or commanding [[Noah's Ark|Noah]] to construct the ark or speaking to Moses from the [[Burning bush]].&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages, Volume 1'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 167-170&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also a brief period in the 4th century when the [[Trinity]] were depicted as three near-identical figures, mostly in depicting scenes from Genesis; the [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus]] in the Vatican is the best known example.  In isolated cases this iconography is found throughout the Middle Ages, and revived somewhat from the 15th century, though it [[Trinity#Less common types of depiction|attracted increasing disapproval]] from church authorities.  A variant is [[Enguerrand Quarton]]'s contract for the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] requiring him to represent the Father and Son of the Holy Trinity as identical figures.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Thiébaut: "Enguerrand Quarton", Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, 2007, [http://www.groveart.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

One scholar has suggested that the enthroned figure in the centre of the [[apse]] mosaic of [[Santa Pudenziana]] in Rome of 390-420, normally regarded as Christ, in fact represents [[God the Father]].&lt;ref&gt;Suggestion by F.W. Sclatter, see review by W. Eugene Kleinbauer of ''The Clash of Gods: A Reinterpretation of Early Christian Art'', by Thomas F. Mathews, ''Speculum'', Vol. 70, No. 4 (Oct., 1995), pp. 937-941, Medieval Academy of America, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2865390 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In situations, such as the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]], where a specific representation of God the Father was indicated, the [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] was used, with increasing freedom from the [[Carolingian art|Carolingian period]] until the end of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]].  This motif now, since the discovery of the 3rd-century [[Dura Europos synagogue]], seems to have been borrowed from [[Jewish art]], and is found in Christian art almost from its beginnings.

The use of religious images in general continued to increase up to the end of the 7th century, to the point that in 695, upon assuming the throne, [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Justinian II]] put an image of Christ on the obverse side of his gold coins, resulting in a rift which ended the use of [[Byzantine]] coin types in the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Cormack, 1985 ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increase in religious imagery did not include depictions of God the Father. For instance, while the eighty second canon of the [[Council of Trullo]] in 692 did not specifically condemn images of The Father, it suggested that icons of [[Christ]] were preferred over Old Testament shadows and figures.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of the 8th century witnessed the suppression and destruction of religious icons as the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] (literally ''image-breaking'') started. Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (717&amp;ndash;741), suppressed the use of icons by [[emperor|imperial]] [[edict]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]], presumably due to a military loss which he attributed to the undue veneration of icons.&lt;ref&gt;According to accounts by Patriarch Nikephoros and the chronicler Theophanes&lt;/ref&gt; The edict (which was issued without consulting the Church) forbade the veneration of religious images but did not apply to other forms of art, including the image of the emperor, or religious symbols such as the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Treadgold, A History of the Byzantine State and Society, Stanford University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Theological arguments against icons then began to appear with [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] arguing that icons could not represent both the divine and the human natures of Jesus at the same time. In this atmosphere, no public depictions of God the Father were even attempted and such depictions only began to appear two centuries later.

==The end of iconoclasm==
[[File:Gottvater thronend Westfalen 15 Jh.jpg|thumb|240px|God the Father on a throne, with the [[Virgin Mary]] and Jesus, [[Westphalia]], Germany, late 15th century.]]
The [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 effectively ended the first period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] and restored the honouring of icons and holy images in general.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Gibbon, 1995 ''The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' {{ISBN|0-679-60148-1}} page 1693&lt;/ref&gt; However, this did not immediately translate into large scale depictions of God the Father. Even supporters of the use of icons in the 8th century, such as Saint [[John of Damascus]], drew a distinction between images of God the Father and those of Christ.

In his treatise ''On the Divine Images'' John of Damascus wrote: "In former times, God who is without form or body, could never be depicted. But now when God is seen in the flesh conversing with men, I make an image of the God whom I see".&lt;ref&gt;St. John of Damascus, ''Three Treatises on the Divine Images'' {{ISBN|0-88141-245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication here is that insofar as God the Father or the Spirit did not become man, visible and tangible, images and portrait icons can not be depicted. So what was true for the whole [[Trinity]] before Christ remains true for the Father and the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] but not for the Word. John of Damascus wrote:&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 29&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If we attempt to make an image of the invisible God, this would be sinful indeed. It is impossible to portray one who is without body:invisible, uncircumscribed and without form."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Ermitorio del Calvario 5.jpg|thumb|left|Calvary hermitage, [[L'Alcora|Alcora]], Spain, 18th century.]]
Around 790 [[Charlemagne]] ordered a set of four books that became known as the [[Libri Carolini]] (i.e. "Charles' books") to refute what his court mistakenly understood to be the iconoclast decrees of the Byzantine [[Second Council of Nicaea]] regarding sacred images. Although not well known during the Middle Ages, these books describe the key elements of the Catholic theological position on sacred images. To the [[Western Church]], images were just objects made by craftsmen, to be utilized for stimulating the senses of the faithful, and to be respected for the sake of the subject represented, not in themselves.

The [[Council of Constantinople (869)]] (considered ecumenical by the Western Church, but not the [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Church]]) reaffirmed the decisions of the Second Council of Nicaea and helped stamp out any remaining coals of [[iconoclasm]]. Specifically, its third canon required the image of Christ to have veneration equal with that of a Gospel book:&lt;ref&gt;Gesa Elsbeth Thiessen, 2005 ''Theological aesthetics'' {{ISBN|0-8028-2888-4}} page 65&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We decree that the sacred image of our Lord Jesus Christ, the liberator and Savior of all people, must be venerated with the same honor as is given the book of the holy Gospels. For as through the language of the words contained in this book all can reach salvation, so, due to the action which these images exercise by their colors, all wise and simple alike, can derive profit from them.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But images of God the Father were not directly addressed in Constantinople in 869. A list of permitted icons was enumerated at this Council, but images of God the Father were not among them.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Bigham, 1995 ''Image of God the Father in Orthodox Theology and Iconography'' {{ISBN|1-879038-15-3}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt; However, the general acceptance of icons and holy images began to create an atmosphere in which God the Father could be depicted.{{cn|date=June 2016|reason=this was before the schism between Catholic and Orthodox}}

==Middle ages to the Renaissance==
[[File:God the Father with His Right Hand Raised in Blessing.jpg|thumb|240px|''God the Father with His Right Hand Raised in Blessing'', with a triangular halo representing the Trinity, [[Girolamo dai Libri]] c. 1555.]]
Prior to the 10th century no attempt was made to represent a separate depiction as a full human figure of [[God the Father]] in [[Western art]].&lt;ref name="James Cornwell page 2"/&gt; Yet, Western art eventually required some way to illustrate the presence of the Father, so through successive representations a set of artistic styles for the depiction of the Father in human form gradually emerged around the 10th century AD.

It appears that when early artists designed to represent God the Father, fear and awe restrained them from a delineation of the whole person. Typically only a small part would be represented, usually the hand, or sometimes the face, but rarely the whole person.  In many images, the figure of the Son supplants the Father, so a smaller portion of the person of the Father is depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Napoléon Didron, 2003 ''Christian iconography: or The history of Christian art in the middle ages'' {{ISBN|0-7661-4075-X}} pages 169&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 12th century depictions of God the Father had started to appear in French [[illuminated manuscript]]s, which as a less public form could often be more adventurous in their iconography, and in [[stained glass]] church windows in England. Initially the head or bust was usually shown in some form of frame of clouds in the top of the picture space, where the Hand of God had formerly appeared; the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] on the famous [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège|baptismal font in Liège]] of [[Rainer of Huy]] is an example from 1118 (a Hand of God is used in another scene).  Gradually the amount of the body shown can increase to a half-length figure, then a full-length, usually enthroned, as in [[Giotto]]'s [[fresco]] of c. 1305 in [[Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arena Chapel]], at the top of the triumphal arch, ''God sending out the angel of the Annunciation''. See Schiller, I, fig 15&lt;/ref&gt;   In the 14th century the [[Naples Bible]] carried a depiction of God the Father in the [[Burning bush]]. By the early 15th century, the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] has a considerable number of images, including an elderly but tall and elegant full-length figure walking in the [[Garden of Eden]] (gallery), which show a considerable diversity of apparent ages and dress.  The [[Battistero di San Giovanni (Florence)#Lorenzo Ghiberti|"Gates of Paradise" of the Florence Baptistry]] by [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], begun in 1425 show a similar tall full-length Father.  The [[Rohan Book of Hours]] of about 1430 also included depictions of God the Father in half-length human form, which were now becoming standard, and the Hand of God becoming rarer.  At the same period other works, like the large Genesis [[altarpiece]] by the Hamburg painter [[Meister Bertram]], continued to use the old depiction of Christ as ''Logos'' in Genesis scenes.  In the 15th century there was a brief fashion for depicting all three persons of the Trinity as [[Trinity#Less common types of depiction|similar or identical figures with the usual appearance of Christ]].

[[File:Andrea_del_Verrocchio,_Leonardo_da_Vinci_-_Baptism_of_Christ_-_Uffizi.jpg|thumb|left|Two "''Hands of God''" (relatively unusual) and the [[Holy Spirit]] as a dove in [[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|''Baptism of Christ'', by Verrocchio]], 1472.]]
[[File:Damian. The Ancient of Days.jpg|thumb|''The Ancient of Days'', a 14th-century fresco from [[Ubisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].]]
In an early Venetian school ''[[Coronation of the Virgin]]'' by [[Giovanni d'Alemagna]] and [[Antonio Vivarini]], (c. 1443) (see gallery below) The Father is shown in the representation consistently used by other artists later, namely as a patriarch, with benign, yet powerful countenance and with long white hair and a beard, a depiction largely derived from, and justified by, the description of the [[Ancient of Days]] in the [[Old Testament]], the nearest approach to a physical description of God in the Old Testament:&lt;ref&gt;Bigham Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;. ...the Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. ([[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 7:9) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the ''Annunciation'' by [[Benvenuto di Giovanni]] in 1470, God the Father is portrayed in the red robe and a hat that resembles that of a Cardinal. However, even in the later part of the 15th century, the representation of the Father and the Holy Spirit as "hands and dove" continued, e.g. in [[The Baptism of Christ (Verrocchio)|Verrocchio's ''Baptism of Christ'']] in 1472.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur de Bles, 2004 ''How to Distinguish the Saints in Art by Their Costumes, Symbols and Attributes'' {{ISBN|1-4179-0870-X}} page 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In Renaissance paintings of the adoration of the Trinity, God may be depicted in two ways, either with emphasis on The Father, or the three elements of the Trinity. The most usual depiction of the Trinity in Renaissance art depicts God the Father as an old man, usually with a long beard and patriarchal in appearance, sometimes with a triangular halo (as a reference to the Trinity), or with a papal tiara, specially in Northern Renaissance painting. In these depictions The Father may hold a globe or book. He is behind and above Christ on the Cross in the [[Throne of Mercy]] iconography. A dove, the symbol of the [[Holy Spirit]] may hover above. Various people from different classes of society, e.g. kings, popes or martyrs may be present in the picture. In a Trinitarian [[Pietà]], God the Father is often shown wearing a papal dress and a papal tiara, supporting the dead Christ in his arms. They float in heaven with angels who carry the [[instruments of the Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;Irene Earls, 1987 ''Renaissance art: a topical dictionary'' {{ISBN|0-313-24658-0}} pages 8 and 283&lt;/ref&gt;

The orb, or the globe of the world, is rarely shown with the other two persons of the Trinity and is almost exclusively restricted to God the Father, but is not a definite indicator since it is sometimes used in depictions of Christ. A book, although often depicted with the Father is not an indicator of the Father and is also used with Christ.&lt;ref name="George Ferguson page 222"/&gt;

==From Renaissance to Baroque==
Representations of God the Father and the Trinity were attacked both by Protestants and within Catholicism, by the [[Jansenist]] and [[Baianist]] movements as well as more orthodox theologians.  As with other attacks on Catholic imagery, this had the effect both of reducing Church support for the less central depictions, and strengthening it for the core ones.  In the [[Western Church]], the pressure to restrain religious imagery resulted in the highly influential decrees of the final session of the [[Council of Trent]] in 1563. The Council of Trent decrees confirmed the traditional Catholic doctrine that images only represented the person depicted, and that veneration to them was paid to the person, not the image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/texts/trent/ct25.html Text of the 25th decree of the Council of Trent]&lt;/ref&gt;

Artistic depictions of God the Father were uncontroversial in Catholic art thereafter, but less common depictions of the [[Trinity]] were condemned.  In 1745 [[Pope Benedict XIV]] explicitly supported the [[Throne of Mercy]] depiction, referring to the "Ancient of Days", but in 1786 it was still necessary for [[Pope Pius VI]] to issue a [[papal bull]] condemning the decision of an Italian church council to remove all images of the Trinity from churches.&lt;ref&gt;Bigham, 73-76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dividing Light from Darkness.jpg|thumb|302x302px|''[[Separation of Light from Darkness]]'', by [[Michelangelo]], c.first half of 1512.]]
God the Father appears in several Genesis scenes in [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], most famously ''[[The Creation of Adam]]''. God the Father is depicted as a powerful figure, floating in the clouds in ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Titian's Assumption of the Virgin]]'' (see gallery below) in the [[Frari of Venice]], long admired as a masterpiece of [[High Renaissance]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Lohr Martz, 1991 ''From Renaissance to baroque: essays on literature and art'' {{ISBN|0-8262-0796-0}} page 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome includes a number of 16th-century depictions of [[God the Father]]. In some of these paintings the [[Trinity]] is still alluded to in terms of three angels, but  [[Giovanni Battista Fiammeri]] also depicted God the Father riding on a cloud, above the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Gauvin A. Bailey, 2003 ''Between Renaissance and Baroque: Jesuit art in Rome'' {{ISBN|0-8020-3721-6}} page 233&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the ''Last Judgment'' and the ''Coronation of the Virgin'' paintings by [[Rubens]] (see gallery below) he depicted God the Father in the form that by then had become widely accepted, as a bearded patriarchal figure above the fray.  In the 17th century, the two Spanish artists [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] (whose father-in-law [[Francisco Pacheco]] was in charge of the approval of new images for the Inquisition) and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] both depicted God the Father as a patriarchal figure with a white beard (see gallery below) in a purple robe.

While representations of God the Father were growing in Italy, Spain, Germany and the Low Countries, there was resistance elsewhere in Europe, even during the 17th century. In 1632 most members of the [[Star Chamber]] court in England (except the [[Archbishop of York]]) condemned the use of the images of the Trinity in church windows, and some considered them illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Winston, 1847 ''An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England'' {{ISBN|1-103-66622-3}}, (2009) page 229&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the 17th century [[Sir Thomas Browne]] wrote that he considered the depiction of God the Father as an old man "a dangerous act" that might lead to Egyptian symbolism.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Thomas Browne's Works, 1852, {{ISBN|0559376871}}, 2006 page 156&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Charles Winston was still critical of such images as a "''[[Romish|Romish trend]]''" (a term used to refer to [[Roman Catholic (term)|Roman Catholics]]) that he considered best avoided in England.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Winston, 1847 ''An Inquiry Into the Difference of Style Observable in Ancient Glass Paintings, Especially in England'' {{ISBN|1-103-66622-3}}, (2009) page 230&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1667 the 43rd chapter of the [[Moscow Sobor of 1666–1667|Great Moscow Council]] specifically included a ban on a number of depictions of God the Father and the Holy Spirit, which then also resulted in a whole range of other icons being placed on the forbidden list,&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Tarasov, 2004 ''Icon and devotion: sacred spaces in Imperial Russia'' {{ISBN|1-86189-118-0}} page 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://genuineorthodoxchurch.com/moscow_1666.htm Orthodox church web site]&lt;/ref&gt; mostly affecting Western-style depictions which had been gaining ground in Orthodox icons. The Council also declared that the person of the Trinity who was the "Ancient of Days" was Christ, as ''Logos'', not God the Father. However some icons continued to be produced in Russia, as well as [[Greece]], [[Romania]], and other Orthodox countries.

'''Green logistics''' describes all attempts to measure and minimize the [[environmental impact|ecological impact]] of [[logistics]] activities. This includes all activities of the forward and reverse flows of products, information and services between the point of origin and the point of consumption. It is the aim to create a sustainable company value using a balance of [[Eco-efficiency|economic and environmental efficiency]]. Green logistics has its origin in the mid 1980s and was a concept to characterize logistics systems and approaches that use advanced technology and equipment to minimize environmental damage during operations.&lt;ref&gt;Thiell, M., Zuluaga, J., Montanez, J., van Hoof, B.: Green Logistics – Global Practices and their Implementation in Emerging Markets, p. 2, Colombia 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demand for action ==
[[File:Green Logistics.png|thumb|300px|right|Three main sections of green logistics]]
Organizations have to face changes in the coming years.

In addition to increasing diversity and dynamics, environmental issues become more important. Social, political and economic demands for sustainable development force organizations to reduce the effect on the environment of their [[supply chain]]s and to develop [[sustainable transport]] and supply chain strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenlogisticsconsultants.com/index.html].  Retrieved 27 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are strong interactions between logistics, environment and natural resources. In addition, the approach of logistics is interdisciplinary, [[holistic]] and cross-company&lt;ref&gt;Hoessle, Ulrike: Sustainable Logistics. Best Lessons from the Global Compact (=WWS Series 2). Seattle 2013.  {{ISBN|978-0-9898270-1-0}}, http://www.wwsworldwide.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
Realising environmental objectives can be done in [[synergy]] with other strategic and financial goals. This is the basis of the great potential of this new logistics problem and challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damco.com/Service/GreenLogistics.aspx].  Retrieved 27 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological concern ==
The "ecological concern" in logistics determines how far the logistics or the supply chain of a company is faced with the issue of [[environmental protection]] and [[resource conservation]]. Basically, a supply chain is affected of various influencing factors in this context. The main influencing factors are the stakeholders of the organization and the rising [[energy economics|costs of energy]] and commodity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umweltschutz-bw.de/index.php?lvl=8127].  Retrieved 27 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the key stakeholders in this context are:

* The [[State (polity)|state]] with growing international and national regulations
* Customers and [[consumers|consumer]] with increasing awareness and demand for ecofriendly products and (logistics) services
* Employees who want to work in an environmentally and socially responsible company
* [[Society]] with increasing claims for more [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR)
* Companies themselves; dealing with their own motivation

There is also the pressure of lenders, investors, insurers and investors. Indications of this are new forms of investment in the [[capital market]], such as the [[Dow Jones Sustainability Index]], that tracks the stock performance of the world's leading companies in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.djindexes.com/sustainability]. Retrieved 27 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dimension of ecological concern of a company is the product of these complex and varying factors.

== Approaches ==
Logistics has a whole range of measures to protect the environment and resources. Some are new, others long-known. These actions can be assigned to different levels{{spaced ndash}} maturity, range, scope, capital expenditure and resource requirements.

Corresponding to the holistic approach of green logistics, logistics has five starting points to implement measures for environmental protection and resource conservation:

# customer, market and product
# structures and planning
# processes, control and measurement
# technologies and resources
# employees, suppliers and service providers

Examples:&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: Betriebliches Energiemanagement{{spaced ndash}} Eine Einführung, pp. 95&amp;ndash;98, Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* More efficient packing
* Route optimization
* Load optimization
* Formation of corporate networks, which are connected by logistics service
* Optimizing physical logistics processes by providing a sophisticated IT support

The first four levels form a hierarchy and influence each other sequentially. Decisions on one level define the scope for further decisions on the following levels. Decisions at higher levels reduce the freedom for the following levels. Example: The determination of the packing mass of a product on the Level one defines the volume and weight of a product and therefore the maximum number of items per carrier (e.g., container). Thus, the decision made on level one influences the maximum capacity of a container. The effects on the environment,{{spaced ndash}} measured as [[carbon dioxide|carbon-dioxide]] ({{CO2}}) emissions per transported product{{spaced ndash}} therefore, are strongly influenced by the decisions made on level one. Decisions made on levels two and three, such as route optimization, also affect carbon-dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Straube, F., Cetinkaya, B: Umwelt und Logistik, pp. 62&amp;ndash;81 in Straube, F.; Pfohl, H.-Chr.: Trends und Strategien in der Logistik – Globale Netzwerke im Wandel, Deutscher Verkehrs-Verlag, Bremen 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-87154-388-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1174">'''The Institute of Geophysics''' (مؤسسه ژئوفیزیک) is the name of a scientific institute in [[Iran]].

The Institute of Geophysics manages Iran's national seismic data, and directs Iran's national calendar, which is based on the [[Solar calendar]]. The authoring of Iran's official lunar and solar calendars each year is specifically headed by Dr. [[Iraj Malekpour]], a faculty member of [[Tehran University]]. 

The Institute of Geophysics was established as part of [[Tehran University]] by ''Hossein Kashi Afshar'' in 1957. The institute's grounds was where the United States had facilities based for seismically monitoring the [[Soviet Union]]'s nuclear testing programs. 

The institute currently trains Ph.D students in [[Meteorology]], [[Seismology]], [[Electromagnetics]], and [[Gravimetry]], and is still affiliated with the [[University of Tehran]].

[[File:Drizzlecombe kist 1.JPG|thumb|'''Kistvaen''' on the southern edge of Dartmoor in Drizzlecombe]]

A '''kistvaen''' or '''cistvaen''' is a [[tomb]] or [[burial chamber]] formed from flat stone slabs in a box-like shape. If set completely underground, it may be covered by a ''[[tumulus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril M. Harris, ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'' (Courier Dover Publications, 1983), p. 118 with illustration [https://books.google.com/books?id=6n4JLmyooTwC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=kistvaen&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=b&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=1946&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=kistvaen&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the [[Welsh Language|Welsh]] ''[[cist]]'' (chest) and ''maen'' (stone). The term originated in relation to [[Celts|Celtic]] structures, typically pre-[[Christian]], but in [[antiquarian]] scholarship of the 19th and early 20th centuries it was sometimes applied to similar structures outside the [[Celtic nations|Celtic world]].

[[File:Kist off merrivale row-4.jpg|thumb|Kistvaen to the south of the stone rows at [[Merrivale, Devon|Merrivale]] on [[Dartmoor]]]]

One of the most numerous kinds of kistvaen are the [[Dartmoor kistvaens]]. These often take the form of small rectangular pits about 3&amp;nbsp;ft. (0.9 m) long by 2 feet (0.6 m) wide. The kistvaens were usually covered with a mound of earth and surrounded by a circle of small stones. When a body was placed in the kistvaen, it was usually lain in a contracted position. Sometimes however the body was [[cremate]]d with the ashes placed in a [[cinerary urn]].

==Kistvaens and Celtic saints==
Kistvaens are also found associated with holy sites or burial places of early [[Celtic Christianity|Celtic saints]], who are often [[hagiography|semi-legendary]]. Saints associated with kistvaens include [[Callwen]] daughter of [[Brychan]], [[Gerent, Saint|Geraint]],&lt;ref&gt;S.

[[File:Kon-Tiki by Gustavo Gerdel.jpg|thumb|250px|The Kon-Tiki raft exhibited at Oslo Museum]]
The '''''Kon-Tiki'' expedition''' was a 1947 journey by [[raft]] across the Pacific Ocean from South America to the Polynesian islands, led by Norwegian explorer and writer [[Thor Heyerdahl]]. The raft was named ''Kon-Tiki'' after the [[Inca]] sun god, [[Viracocha]], for whom "Kon-Tiki" was said to be an old name. ''[[The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas|Kon-Tiki]]'' is also the name of Heyerdahl's book; the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award]]-winning [[Kon-Tiki (1950 film)|documentary film]] chronicling his adventures; and the [[Kon-Tiki (2012 film)|2012 dramatized feature film]] nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]].

Heyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in [[pre-Columbian]] times. His aim in mounting the ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition was to show, by using only the materials and technologies available to those people at the time, that there were no technical reasons to prevent them from having done so. Although the expedition carried some modern equipment, such as a radio, watches, charts, [[sextant]], and metal knives, Heyerdahl argued they were incidental to the purpose of proving that the raft itself could make the journey.

The ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition was funded by private loans, along with donations of equipment from the [[United States Army]]. Heyerdahl and a small team went to [[Peru]], where, with the help of dockyard facilities provided by the Peruvian authorities, they constructed the raft out of [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] logs and other native materials in an indigenous style as recorded in illustrations by Spanish [[conquistadores]]. The trip began on April 28, 1947. Heyerdahl and five companions sailed the raft for 101 days over 6,900&amp;nbsp;km (4,300 miles) across the Pacific Ocean before smashing into a [[reef]] at [[Raroia]] in the [[Tuamotus]] on August 7, 1947. The crew made successful landfall and all returned safely.

Thor Heyerdahl's book about his experience became a bestseller. It was published in Norwegian in 1948 as ''The Kon-Tiki Expedition: By Raft Across the South Seas'', later reprinted as ''Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific in a Raft''. It appeared with great success in English in 1950, also in many other languages.  A documentary [[motion picture]] about the expedition, also called ''Kon-Tiki'', was produced from a write-up and expansion of the crew's filmstrip notes and won an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Academy Award]] in 1951. It was directed by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] and edited by [[Olle Nordemar]]. The voyage was also chronicled in the documentary TV-series ''The Kon-Tiki Man: The Life and Adventures of Thor Heyerdahl'', directed by Bengt Jonson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kon-tiki.no/Events/indexold.html ''The Kon-Tiki Man'' episode breakdown] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028203635/http://www.kon-tiki.no/Events/indexold.html |date=October 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original ''Kon-Tiki'' raft is now on display in the [[Kon-Tiki Museum]] at [[Bygdøy]] in [[Oslo]].

== Crew ==
''Kon-Tiki'' had a six-man crew, all of whom were Norwegian except for Bengt Danielsson, a Swede.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2ysYAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Watzinger+Raaby+Haugland&amp;dq=Watzinger+Raaby+Haugland |title=The Kon-Tiki Expedition  |first=Thor  |last=Thor Heyerdahl |publisher=Rand McNally|year= 1968 |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thor Heyerdahl]] (1914–2002) was the expedition leader. He was also the author of the book of the expedition and the narrator of the story. Heyerdahl had studied the ancient people of South America and Polynesia and believed that there was a link between the two.
* [[Erik Hesselberg]] (1914–1972) was the navigator and artist. He painted the large Kon-Tiki figure on the raft's sail. His children's book ''Kon-Tiki and I'' appeared in Norwegian in 1949 and has since been published in more than 15 languages.
* [[Bengt Danielsson]] (1921–1997) took on the role of steward, in charge of supplies and daily rations.  Danielsson was a Swedish sociologist interested in [[human migration|human migration theory]].  He also served as translator, as he was the only member of the crew who spoke Spanish. He was also a voracious reader; his box aboard the raft contained many books.
* [[Knut Haugland]] (1917–2009) was a radio expert, decorated by the British in World War II for actions in the [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]] that stalled what were believed to be Germany's plans to develop an [[atomic bomb]]. Haugland was the last surviving crew member; he died on Christmas Day, 2009 at the age of 92.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/last-crew-member-on-kon-tiki-expedition-dies.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Torstein Raaby]] (1918–1964) was also in charge of radio transmissions. He gained radio experience while hiding behind German lines during WWII, spying on the German battleship ''[[German battleship Tirpitz|Tirpitz]]''. His secret radio transmissions eventually helped guide in Allied bombers to sink the ship.
* [[Herman Watzinger]] (1910–1986) was an engineer whose area of expertise was in technical measurements.  He was the first to join Heyerdahl for the trip. He collected and recorded all sorts of data on the voyage. Much of what he recorded, such as weather data, was sent back to various people, since this area of the ocean was largely unstudied.

The expedition also carried a pet [[parrot]] named Lorita.

==Construction==
The main body of the float was composed of nine [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] tree trunks up to {{convert|45|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|2|ft|cm|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in diameter, lashed together with {{convert|1+1/4|in|mm|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} [[hemp]] ropes. Cross-pieces of balsa logs {{convert|18|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} in diameter were lashed across the logs at {{convert|3|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} intervals to give lateral support. [[Pine]] splashboards clad the bow, and lengths of pine {{convert|1|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} thick and {{convert|2|ft|cm|order=flip|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide were wedged between the balsa logs and used as [[centreboard]]s.

The main mast was made of lengths of mangrove wood lashed together to form an A-frame {{convert|29|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high. Behind the main-mast was a cabin of plaited bamboo {{convert|14|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|8|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide was built about {{convert|4|-|5|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} high, and roofed with banana leaf thatch. At the stern was a {{convert|19|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} long steering oar of mangrove wood, with a blade of fir. The main sail was {{convert|15|by|18|ft|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} on a yard of bamboo stems lashed together. Photographs also show a top-sail above the main sail, and also a mizzen-sail, mounted at the stern.

The raft was partially decked in split bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LxMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Guardian+Rios&amp;dq=Guardian+Rios |title=Kon-Tiki: across the Pacific by raft|page=63 |first=Thor |last= Heyerdahl |publisher=Rand McNally |year= 1984|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main spars were a laminate of wood and reeds and Heyerdahl tested more than twenty different composites before settling on one that proved an effective compromise between bulk and torsional rigidity. No metal was used in the construction.

==Supplies==
''Kon-Tiki'' carried {{convert|275|USgal|l|order=flip}} of drinking water in 56 water cans, as well as a number of sealed bamboo rods. The purpose stated by Heyerdahl for carrying modern and ancient containers was to test the effectiveness of ancient water storage. For food ''Kon-Tiki'' carried 200 [[coconut]]s, [[sweet potato]]es, [[calabash|bottle gourds]] and other assorted fruit and roots. The [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps]] provided [[field ration]]s, tinned food and survival equipment. In return, the ''Kon-Tiki'' explorers reported on the quality and utility of the provisions. They also caught plentiful numbers of fish, particularly [[flying fish]], "[[mahi-mahi|dolphin fish]]", [[yellowfin tuna]], [[bonito]] and [[shark]].

==Communications==
[[File:NC-173, KonTiki.jpg|thumb|right|National NC-173 radio receiver used by the expedition.]]
The expedition carried an [[amateur radio]] station with the call sign of LI2B operated by former [[World War II]] [[Norwegian resistance movement|Norwegian resistance]] radio operators Knut Haugland and Torstein Raaby.&lt;ref name="arrlDec1947"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=QST |title=Kon-Tiki Communications – Well Done! |date=December 1947 |author=Anonymous |pages=69, 143–48 |publisher=The [[American Radio Relay League]]}}([http://p1k.arrl.org/cgi-bin/topdf.cgi?id=28028&amp;pub=qst pdf])&lt;/ref&gt;  Haugland and Raaby maintained regular communication with a number of American, Canadian, and South American stations that relayed ''Kon Tiki's'' status to the Norwegian Embassy in Washington, D.C. On August 5, Haugland made contact with a station in Oslo, Norway, {{convert|10000|mi|km|order=flip}} away.&lt;ref name="arrl"&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/features/2003/03/05/1/?nc=1 ''An LA, as in Norway, Story, by Bob Merriam, W1NTE''], March 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2002/04/24/1/ ''Thor Heyerdahl of Kon-Tiki fame dies at 87''], April 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kon Tiki's'' transmitters were powered by batteries and a hand-cranked generator and operated on the [[40-meter band|40]], [[20-meter band|20]], [[10-meter band|10]], and [[6-meter band]]s. Each unit was water resistant, used [[List of vacuum tubes#2E30|2E30]] [[vacuum tube]]s, and provided approximately 6 [[watt]]s of [[radio frequency|RF]] output; the equivalent of a small [[flashlight]].&lt;ref name="Heyerdahl2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thor Heyerdahl|title=Kon-Tiki|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_rby49uet8UC&amp;pg=PT148|accessdate=29 August 2013|date=7 May 2013|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-8592-3|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two British 3-16&amp;nbsp;MHz Mark II transmitters were also carried on board, as was a VHF transmitter for communicating with aircraft and a hand-cranked [[Survival radio]] of the Gibson Girl type for 500 and 8280&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name="arrlDec1947" /&gt;

The radio receiver used throughout the voyage, a [[National Radio Company]] NC-173, once required a thorough drying out after being soaked when landing in Raratonga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~postr/bapix/NC173.htm |title=Boatanchor Pix, National NC-173 |publisher=Oak.cats.ohiou.edu |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823105931/http://www.ohio.edu/people/postr/bapix/NC173.htm|archivedate=August 23, 2016|date=September 23, 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew once used a hand-cranked emergency transmitter to send out an "all well, all well" message "just in time to head off a massive rescue attempt".&lt;ref name="ARRLinbrief"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Brief|url=http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2002/04/24/1/|website=American Radio Relay League|publisher=[[ARRL]]|accessdate=22 May 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021125203835/http://www.arrl.org/news/stories/2002/04/24/1/|archivedate=November 25, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The call sign LI2B was used by Heyerdahl again in 1969–70, when he built a papyrus reed raft and sailed from Morocco to Barbados in an attempt to show a possible link between the civilization of ancient Egypt and the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thor Heyerdahl|title=The Ra Expeditions|edition=English|year=1971

==The voyage==
''Kon-Tiki'' left [[Callao]], [[Peru]], on the afternoon of April 28, 1947. To avoid coastal traffic it was initially towed {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} out by the Fleet Tug ''Guardian Rios'' of the [[Peruvian Navy]], then sailed roughly west carried along on the [[Humboldt Current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=LxMNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Guardian+Rios&amp;dq=Guardian+Rios |title=Kon-Tiki: across the Pacific by raft|page=98 |first=Thor |last= Heyerdahl |publisher=Rand McNally |year= 1984|accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew's first sight of land was the atoll of [[Puka-Puka]] on July 30. On August 4, the 97th day after departure, ''Kon-Tiki'' reached the Angatau atoll. The crew made brief contact with the inhabitants of [[Fangatau|Angatau Island]], but were unable to land safely. Calculations made by Heyerdahl before the trip had indicated that 97 days was the minimum amount of time required to reach the Tuamotu islands, so the encounter with Angatau showed that they had made good time.

On August 7, the voyage came to an end when the raft struck a reef and was eventually beached on an uninhabited islet off [[Raroia]] [[atoll]] in the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu]] group. The team had travelled a distance of around {{convert|6980|km|mi nmi|abbr=on}} in 101 days, at an average speed of {{convert|1.5|kn|km/h mph|1}}.

After spending a number of days alone on the tiny islet, the crew was greeted by men from a village on a nearby island who arrived in canoes, having seen washed-up flotsam from the raft. The crew were taken back to the native village, where they were feted with traditional dances and other festivities. Finally the crew were taken off Raroia to [[Tahiti]] by the French schooner ''Tamara'', with the salvaged ''Kon-Tiki'' in tow.

== Anthropology ==
[[Image:Kneeled moai Easter Island.jpg|thumb|A [[moai]]]]
Heyerdahl believed that the original inhabitants of [[Easter Island]] were migrants from Peru. He argued that the monumental statues known as [[moai]] resembled sculptures more typical of pre-Columbian Peru than any Polynesian designs. He believed that the Easter Island myth of a power struggle between two peoples called the [[Hanau epe]] and [[Hanau momoko]] was a memory of conflicts between the original inhabitants of the island and a later wave of Native Americans from the Northwest coast, eventually leading to the annihilation of the Hanau epe and the destruction of the island's culture and once-prosperous economy.&lt;ref&gt;Heyderdahl, Thor. ''Easter Island – The Mystery Solved''. Random House New York 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rose"&gt;Robert C. Suggs, "Kon-Tiki", in Rosemary G. Gillespie, D. A. Clague (eds), ''Encyclopedia of Islands'', University of California Press, 2009, pp. 515–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians consider that the Polynesians from the west were the original inhabitants and that the story of the Hanau epe is either pure myth, or a memory of internal tribal or class conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Long, "Does 'Rapa Nui' Take Artistic License Too Far?", Los Angeles Times, Friday August 26, 1994, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Flenley, Paul G.

Analysis showed that "although the European lineage could be explained by contact with white Europeans after the island was 'discovered' in 1722 by Dutch sailors, the South American component was much older, dating to between about 1280 and 1495, soon after the island was first colonised by Polynesians in around 1200."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New findings show more contact between prehistoric humans|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/new-discoveries-show-more-contact-between-farflung-prehistoric-humans-than-had-been-thought-9814377.html|accessdate = 2015-10-25|date = 2014-10-23|website = The Independent|quote = Evidence found of contact between Easter Islanders and South America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later recreations of ''Kon-Tiki'' ==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2018}}&lt;!--four subsections have no citations--&gt;
===''Seven Little Sisters''===
In 1954 [[William Willis (sailor)|William Willis]] sailed alone on a raft ''Seven Little Sisters'' from [[Peru]] to [[American Samoa]], successfully completing the journey.&lt;ref&gt;Willis, William (1955). ''The Epic Voyage of the Seven Little Sisters: A 6700 Mile Voyage Alone Across the Pacific''. London: Hutchinson&lt;/ref&gt; He sailed {{convert|6,700|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}, which was {{convert|2,200|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} farther than ''Kon-Tiki''. In a second great voyage ten years later, he rafted {{convert|7457|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from South America to Australia with a metal raft ''Age Unlimited''.

===''Kantuta''===
In 1955, the Czech explorer and adventurer [[Eduard Ingris]] attempted to recreate the ''Kon-Tiki'' expedition on a balsa raft called ''[[Kantuta Expeditions|Kantuta]]''. His first expedition, ''Kantuta I'', took place in 1955–1956 and led to failure. In 1959 Ingris built a new balsa raft, ''Kantuta II'', and tried to repeat the previous expedition. The second expedition was a success. Ingris was able to cross the Pacific Ocean on the balsa raft from Peru to Polynesia.

===''Tahiti-Nui''===
A French seafarer, [[Éric de Bisschop]], committed himself in a project he had had for some years: he built a Polynesian raft in order to cross the eastern Pacific Ocean from [[Tahiti]] to [[Chile]] (contrary to [[Thor Heyerdahl]]'s crossing); the ''Tahiti-Nui'' left [[Papeete]] with a crew of five on November 8, 1956. When near the [[Juan Fernández Islands]] (Chile) in May 1957, the raft was in a very poor state and they asked for a towing, but it was damaged during the operation and had to be abandoned, but they could keep all the equipment aboard.

===''Tahiti-Nui II''===
A second ''Tahiti-Nui'' was built in [[Constitución, Chile]], leaving on April 13, 1958, towards [[Callao]], then towards the Marquesas. It missed its target and after 4 months, the raft began to sink. The crew built a new smaller raft, the ''Tahiti Nui III'', in the ocean out of the more buoyant parts of the ''Tahiti Nui II''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric de Bisschop and James Wharram – Catamaran pioneers|url=http://wharram.com/site/about/eric-de-bisschop_en|work=James Wharram Designs|publisher=James Wharram Designs|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They were swept towards [[Cook Islands]] where on August 30, the raft went aground and was wrecked at [[Rakahanga]] atoll. Éric de Bisschop died in this accident.

===''Tangaroa''===
A Peruvian expedition led by [[Carlos Caravedo]] crossed the Pacific Ocean in 1965 in 115 days in a raft named ''Tangaroa'', of which 18 days were used by the crew to cross [[Tuamotus]], the Tuamotu Archipielago, making ''Tangaroa'' the only raft that has managed to cross that dangerous archipelago of [[French Polynesia]] by its own means. On November 18, 1965, the ''Tangaroa'' ended its journey on the [[Fakarava]] island. Fakarava is where the ''Tangaroa'' is currently preserved.

===Las Balsas===
The 1973 [[Las Balsas]] expedition was the first (and so far only) multiple-raft crossing of the Pacific Ocean in recent history. It is the longest-known raft voyage in history. The expedition was led by Spaniard [[Vital Alsar]], who, in 1970, led the [[La Balsa]] expedition, only on that occasion with one raft and three companions. The crossing was successful and, at the time, the longest raft voyage in history, until eclipsed in 1973 by Las Balsas. The purpose of the 1973 expedition was three-fold: (1) to prove that the success of 1970 was no accident, (2) to test different currents in the sea, which Alsar maintained ancient mariners knew as modern humans know road maps, and (3) to show that the original expeditions, directed perhaps toward trade or colonisation, may have consisted of small fleets of balsa rafts.

===''Tangaroa''===
[[File:Tangaroa 1.jpg|thumb|''Tangaroa'' anchored by [[Stavern]], Norway]]

In 2006, the [[Tangaroa Expedition]] recreated the ''Kon-Tiki'' voyage using a newly built raft, the ''[[Tangaroa]]'', named after the Māori sea-god [[Tangaroa]]. Tangaroa's six-man crew was led by Norwegian [[Torgeir Sæverud Higraff|Torgeir Higraff]] and included Olav Heyerdahl, grandson of Thor Heyerdahl, Bjarne Krekvik (captain), Øyvin Lauten (executive officer), Swedish Anders Berg (photographer) and Peruvian Roberto Sala.&lt;ref&gt;Tangaroa Crew. Azerbaijan International, Vol 14:4 (Winter 2006), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Tangaroa was launched on the same day that Kon-Tiki had been—April 28—and it reached its destination on July 7, which was 30 days faster than Heyerdahl's Kon-Tiki which had taken 101 days for the voyage. Tangaroa's speed was credited to the proper use of [[guara (centerboard)|guaras (centerboards)]].

===''An-Tiki''===
On January 30, 2011, ''An-Tiki'', a raft modeled after ''Kon-Tiki'', began a {{convert|3000|mi|km|order=flip|adj=on}}, 70-day journey across the Atlantic Ocean from the Canary Islands to the island of [[Eleuthera]] in the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eleutheranews.com/local/1159.html |title=The Eleutheran – Eleuthera News, Sport and much more from Eleuthera – The tale of An-Tiki – One raft, four ‘mature’ adventurers and a very big ocean! |publisher=Eleutheranews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition was piloted by four men, aged from 56 to 84 years, led by [[Anthony Smith (explorer)|Anthony Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eleutheranews.com/local/1232.html |title=The Eleutheran – Eleuthera News, Sport and much more from Eleuthera – The An-Tiki Dream Turns into Reality |publisher=Eleutheranews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trip was designed to commemorate the journey in an open boat of survivors from the British steamship ''Anglo-Saxon'', sunk by the German cruiser ''[[German auxiliary cruiser Widder|Widder]]'' in 1940. The raft ended its voyage in the Caribbean island of [[St Maarten]], completing its trip to Eleuthera in the following year with Smith and a new crew.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/activityandadventure/9247834/Voyage-to-the-brink-of-death.html# Anthony Smith, "Voyage to the Brink of Death", ''The Daily Telegraph'', 6 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.scribd.com/doc/20873940/Balsa-Tangaroa-Raft-Tangaroa-Www-geocities Balsa Tangaroa Raft]. Retrieved 27 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Kon-Tiki2''===
On 7 November 2015, two teams with two balsa rafts ''Rahiti Tane'' and ''Tupac Yupanqui'' left [[Lima]], [[Peru]] for [[Easter Island]]. Expedition ''[[Kon-Tiki2]]'' got its name because it had 2 crews from many nations: Norway, Russia, UK, Mexico, New Zealand, Sweden, and Peru. It sought to double down on Heyerdahl's voyage by sailing two rafts from South America to Polynesia and then back. Expedition leader was Torgeir Higraff from Tangaroa Expedition (2006). Øyvin Lauten and Kari Skår Dahl were captains on the first leg, while Signe Meling and Ola Borgfjord were captains on the second leg. The raft reached Easter Island, but did not complete the return.

The two rafts were made of 11 balsa logs and 10 crossbeams held together by 2000 meters of natural fiber ropes. Tens of thousands of waves, up to six meters tall, hit the rafts in an [[El Niño]] year. This stress for 16 weeks weakened the ropes, but the crew could not replace all of them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kontiki2.com/ Official page of Kon-Tiki2 Expedition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niva.no/en/kon-tiki-2-kaster-loss Kon-Tiki 2 sets sail.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">[[Image:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry aout.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration from [[Très riches heures du Duc de Berry]], 1412-16, by Pol and Hermann de Limbourg, representing the month of August and depicting, in the foreground, the Nobility riding out to hunt with falcons while in the midground, the harvest takes place and the workers cool off in the river. One of the Duc's many castles, Étampes, completes the scene. Illumination on vellum, 22,5 x 13,6 cm]]
The term '''Labours of the Months''' refers to cycles in [[Medieval art|Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance art]] depicting in twelve scenes the rural activities that commonly took place in the months of the year.  They are often linked to the signs of the [[Zodiac]], and are seen as humankind's response to God's ordering of the Universe. 

The Labours of the Months are frequently found as part of large sculptural schemes on churches, and in [[illuminated manuscripts]], especially in the Calendars of late medieval [[Book of Hours|Books of Hours]].  The manuscripts are important for the development of [[landscape painting]], containing most of the first painting where this was given prominence. The most famous cycle is that painted in the early 15th century by [[Limbourg Brothers|Hermann, Pol and Johan de Limbourg]] in [[Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]. In the 16th century, late in the history of the theme, [[Simon Bening]] produced especially fine cycles which link the Limbourgs with the landscape paintings of [[Peter Breughel the Elder]].

==Typical cycle==
The contents of cycles varied with date, location, and the purpose of the work. The [[Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] &lt;small&gt;(illustrated right)&lt;/small&gt; was designed for the personal use of a great magnate, and was unusually large, allowing all the typical elements to be used in many months. It combines astrological and calendar information at the top, with a combination of the agricultural life of the peasant, the life of the elite courtiers, and illustrations of the Duke's many castles in the background of several scenes.   

A typical simple scheme was:&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, Robert G. ''Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages'', mp 246, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

*January - Feasting
*February - Sitting by the fire
*March - Pruning trees, or digging
*April - Planting, enjoying the country or picking flowers
*May - Hawking, courtly love
*June - Hay harvest
*July - Wheat harvest
*August - Wheat threshing
*September - Grape harvest
*October - Ploughing or sowing
*November - Gathering acorns for pigs
*December - Killing pigs, baking

- but there were many variations, especially in major wine-growing areas, where more wine related scenes were included.  Italian cycles often advance the agricultural scenes a month earlier than ones from the [[Low countries]] or England.  The impact of the onset of the [[Little Ice Age]] has been detected in differences between early and late examples.

==Sculpture cycles==
[[Image:Perugia - Fontana Maggiore - 1 - Mesi - 09 - Settembre - Foto G. Dall'Orto 5 ago 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|The Month of September from the Fontana Maggiore in [[Perugia]] (c. 1275), by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, shows the treading of grapes.]] 
Most sculptured cycles in Europe, especially when compressed into the [[archivolt]] of a portal, consist of an astrological symbol beside, above or incorporated in a sculpture or relief illustrating a monthly labour.

A few sculpted examples of the many surviving are: 
* [[Chartres cathedral]]: west and north portal archivolts. Window, see below
* [[Notre Dame, Paris]]: northern doorjambs of the west facade (Portal of the Virgin), and a stained glass Zodiacs, labours, vices and virtues cycle filling the west rose window
* [[Abbey of la Madaleine, Vézelay|Vezelay Abbey]]: Archivolt of main west basilica doorway
* [[Autun Cathedral]]: Archivolt of main west cathedral doorway
* [[Ferrara Cathedral]]
* [[Saint Mark's, Venice]]: main portal
* [[San Zeno di Verona]]: facade
* [[Lucca Cathedral]]:  large bas-relief panels with little Zodial signs, to the right and left of the main facade door
* [[Fontana Maggiore]], [[Perugia]]: relief panels showing monthly labours are amongst those surrounding the lower basin of the great  fountain in front of the Duomo.
* [[Otranto Cathedral]]: Zodiac signs and labours form part of the mosaic scenes which cover the entire floor.
* [[Canterbury Cathedral]]: Zodiac signs and monthly labours are amongst the subjects illustrated in large inlaid marble floor medallions on the edge of the Trinity Chapel close to where the shrine of Saint Thomas (Becket) was located.
* [[St Augustine's Church, Brookland]], Kent: large cylindrical lead font with reliefs of both Zodiac signs and monthly labours - a rare example in the UK both of such a font and of the combination of zodiac signs and monthly labours.
* [[Carlisle Cathedral]]: the foliate capitals of the twelve piers of the choir each contain a figure representing one of the labours of the months.

==Stained glass==
[[Image:Chartres_cathedral_041_Seasons_Dec_Jan_Feb.JPG|thumb|250px|Chartres Cathedral, the months of December, January and February]]
The Labours of the months often occur in those [[rose window]]s that are dedicated to the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]], the circular nature of the window suiting the cyclic theme. In these windows, the months are part of a complex iconographical scheme. Other windows have the Labours of the Months specifically as their subject matter. 

* [[Basilica of Saint Denis]] : rose window of Creation in the north transept.
* [[Chartres Cathedral]] : "Labours of the Months" window in south ambulatory

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3905">The '''Marshall Sklare Award''' is an annual honor of the [[Association for the Social Scientific Study of Jewry]] (ASSJ). The ASSJ seeks to recognize "a senior scholar who has made a significant scholarly contribution to the social scientific study of Jewry." In most cases, the recipient has given a scholarly address. In recent years, the honored scholar has presented the address at the annual meeting of the [[Association for Jewish Studies]].

The award is named in memory of the "founding father of American Jewish sociology" [[Marshall Sklare]] (1921-1992), who had been Klutznick Family Professor of Contemporary Jewish Studies and Sociology at [[Brandeis University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE3D81431F930A25750C0A964958260 |title=Marshall Sklare, 70, an Authority On Sociology of American Jewry - New York Times |accessdate=2008-01-27 |format= |work=The New York Times | date=1992-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Patriarchy''''' is a 2007 book by [[V. Geetha]], an academic activist and author on the subject of [[patriarchy]] in [[India]]. The book, written from the female perspective, is part of the "Theorizing Feminism" series published by Stree (an imprint of [[Bhatkal and Sen]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-bookreview/patriarchy-through-the-feminist-lens/article1446078.ece|title = Patriarchy Through the Feminist Lens|last = Swaminathan|first = Padmini|date = 2 January 2008|work = The Hindu|access-date = 22 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three editions have been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.worldcat.org/title/patriarchy/oclc/154204766/editions?editionsView=true&amp;referer=br|title = Patriarchy listing on WorldCat|date = |accessdate = 22 August 2015|website = WorldCat|publisher = OCLC|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In India, [[patriarchy]] disrupts women's lives. According to Geetha,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.saarthakindia.org/womens_situation_India.html|title = Women's Situation in India|date = |accessdate = 22 August 2015|website = Saarthak|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Sexual violence has been blamed on a patriarchal backlash where the term 'patriarchy' is often synonymous with 'tradition{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/17/sexual-violence-india-patriarchal-narendra-modi-women-reform-rape|title = Sexual Violence in India is a Patriarchal Backlash That Must Be Stopped|last = Virmani|first = Priya|date = 17 June 2014|work = The Guardian|access-date = 22 August 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminism]] has a long tradition of examining the concept of patriarchy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://isj.org.uk/theories-of-patriarchy/|title = Theories of Patriarchy|last = German|first = Lindsey|date = 1981|journal = International Socialism|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 22 August 2015|issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book attempts to demonstrate that the nature, effect, and meanings of male authority and power can only be understood through the idea of patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 203&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''Patriarchy'' introduces readers to [[concept]]s in [[feminist theory]] involving [[patriarchy]]. According to Geetha, "The book does not propound a theory of patriarchy; rather, it points to those areas of reality and traditions of knowledge that we might need to draw upon to define patriarchy. It indicates the need for theory-making, and shows how this may be done. Its intent is fundamentally [[pedagogical]] and is a beginners' text to help the reader consider patriarchy in all its aspects".&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

She describes how knowledge about patriarchy cannot be easily separated from the feminist desire to generate such knowledge:&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 4- 61&lt;/ref&gt; "By understanding patriarchy, the notions of production and reproduction are important concepts". Geetha highlights unique aspects of [[Culture of India|Indian society]], such as kinship structures and the [[caste system]],&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj. Kolkata:Mandira Sen for STREE. page 61-131&lt;/ref&gt; to better understand patriarchy. According to the author, "A woman's identity as a citizen and rights to equality are undercut by the fact of their gender".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Geetha theorizes that patriarchal power "is not merely coercive ... Cultural and sexual [[norm (social)|norm]]s constitute the everyday exercise of patriarchal power".&lt;ref&gt;V.Geetha. (2007).patriarchy. theorizing feminism. series editor Maithreyi Krishnaraj.

'''Peter James Clayton''' (25 June 1927, [[Sydenham]], London – 10 August 1991, [[Sydenham]], London)&lt;ref name="Eng &amp; Wales death index" /&gt; was an English jazz presenter on BBC radio, jazz critic, and author. From October 1968 until his death in August 1991, Clayton presented jazz recordings, interviews, studio performances, and live performances on [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2|2]], and [[BBC Radio 3|3]], as well as the [[BBC World Service]].  He co-authored several books about music and jazz with [[Peter Gammond]] and was a frequent contributor to jazz magazines.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012 Nov 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford Press obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clayton photo" /&gt;

==Early life==
After leaving school in 1945, Clayton served three years in the [[RAF]], serving mainly in [[Iraq]] and [[Kuwait]]. After [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilisation]] in 1948, Clayton was employed for a short while as a catering assistant with a hydroelectric scheme in the [[Scottish Highlands]] – "a [[porridge]] stirrer" was his job description – before joining the staff of [[Greenwich]] Public Library, where he remained for seven years. In the 1950s he worked for [[Decca Records]] as a music editor.

==Broadcast career==
After leaving [[Decca Records|Decca]], Clayton began presenting or hosting jazz music on [[BBC]] Radio in October 1968, with a programme called ''Jazz on One'' which was broadcast on 247 metres (1215&amp;nbsp;kHz) [[medium wave]] on Sunday evenings.

In 1970, the BBC reorganised the four national networks, [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]], [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]], and [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]].  Programmes from [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] were moved to [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]], which included ''[[Family Favourites]],'' ''Late Night Extra,'' ''Night Ride'' and the Sunday night jazz shows.  [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] used [[VHF]] [[transmitters]] and was broadcast on 88–91 [[MHz]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]].

Clayton went on in 1970 to present ''Jazz Notes.'' In October 1973, the BBC added back [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] as a carrier for jazz and other shows, while continuing to carry those shows on [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]].  That same month, the BBC launched Clayton's best remembered programme, ''Sounds of Jazz,'' Sundays at 10 {{smallcaps|pm}}, with its own theme music composed by [[Laurie Johnson]]:
* [http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/sounds/theme_clayton_sounds_jazz.mp3 "Theme to ''Sounds of Jazz"'']

According to [[Alyn Shipton]] in 2012, "Throughout the 70s and 80s, Peter [Clayton] became synonymous with jazz on BBC Radio."&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012 Nov 14" /&gt; In addition to playing jazz records, Clayton organised and presented live jazz recordings with studio audiences, with sets lasting about 30 minutes recorded at [[Maida Vale Studios|BBC's Maida Vale Studios]] in London during the week. Frequent artists included clarinetist [[Dave Shepherd]] and his quintet, pianist [[Colin Purbrook]] (1936–1999), pianist [[Brian Lemon]] and his octet, tenor saxophonist [[Danny Moss]] and his wife, vocalist [[Jeanie Lambe]] (born 1940), and trumpeter [[Kenny Baker (trumpeter)|Kenny Baker]].  The [[Mike Westbrook Orchestra]] made several broadcasts and filled the studio.

===Broadcast interviews===
On 12 April 1974, Clayton interviewed the jazz pianist [[Oscar Peterson]] on [[BBC Radio 3]].  During the programme, Peterson performed and played some of his records.&lt;ref name="BBC Clayton/Peterson 1974" /&gt; Clayton interviewed [[Sarah Vaughan]] on his ''Sounds of Jazz'' programme on 11 July 1977, when Vaughan sang a tribute to the music of [[George Gershwin]].

===''Sounds of Jazz'' and ''Jazz Record Requests''===
On [[BBC Radio 3]], he succeeded [[Steve Race]] as the presenter of the Saturday afternoon programme ''[[BBC Radio 3#Jazz Record Requests|Jazz Record Requests]]'', and played requests from an international audience on ''Jazz for the Asking'' on the [[BBC World Service]].  In a 2005 ''Jazz UK'' article about the BBC's influence on jazz in the UK, authors Brian Blain and [[John Fordham]] stated:

{{quote|Informed presenters like the late Peter Clayton and [[Charles Fox (jazz critic)|Charles Fox]] served jazz superbly, and were looked on with real affection.  For many years a long procession of bands, in all styles, made their way to the [[Maida Vale Studios|BBC's Maida Vale studios]] to record jazz, often in a near gig setting in front of enthusiastic audiences.&lt;ref name="Jazz UK 2005 Jan"/&gt;}}

When Clayton became ill from cancer, [[Charles Fox (jazz critic)|Charles Fox]] took his place in 1990. Then Fox died on 9 May 1991, and Clayton resumed the show, recording segments at home from a wheelchair.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012 Nov 14" /&gt; His show ''Sounds of Jazz'' continued to be heard on [[BBC Radio 2]] until his death. When Clayton died, {{cardinal to word|{{age in days|1991|5|9|1991|8|10}}}} days after [[Charles Fox (jazz critic)|Fox]] died, [[Geoffrey Smith (radio presenter)|Geoffrey Smith]] took over.&lt;ref name="Guardian 2012 Nov 14" /&gt;

===Writing===
Throughout his broadcasting career, Clayton wrote several books with a colleague, Peter Gammond (born 1925).&lt;ref name="Gammond" group=lower-alpha /&gt;

The '''Philadelphia Center for Architecture''' is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3) non-profit organization]] founded in 2002&lt;ref name=About/&gt; by the [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA). The Center opened a physical space on the ground floor of the [[Smyth Young Field Company Building]] in  2008.&lt;ref name=About/&gt;  The building, at 1218 Arch Street, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nrhp nom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McVarish|first1=Douglas C.|title=Young, Smyth, Field Company Building|url=http://www.dot7.state.pa.us/CRGIS_Attachments/SiteResource/H052754_01H.pdf|website=Pennsylvania CGRIS|publisher=Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission|accessdate=21 September 2015|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Center serves as a venue for public programs on [[architecture]], [[urban planning]], and [[design]], including various competitions and exhibitions, as well as home to offices for AIA Philadelphia, the Community Design Collaborative, and the AIA Bookstore.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Center for Architecture|url=http://www.philadelphiacfa.org/about|website=Philadelphia Center for Architecture|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AboutAIA&gt;{{cite web|title=About AIA Philadelphia|url=http://aiaphiladelphia.org/about-aia-philadelphia|website=AIA Philadelphia|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neon&gt;{{cite news|title=Neon art colors the Center for Architecture|url=http://www.theartblog.org/2012/06/neon-art-colors-the-center-for-architecture/|accessdate=24 September 2015|work=Philadelphia Daily News|date=June 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
AIA Philadelphia is the second oldest Chapter of the AIA and a nonprofit with IRS 501(c)(6) status, designating it as a professional membership organization. The [[American Institute of Architects]] was founded in 1857, and the Philadelphia chapter received its charter in 1869. The Chapter includes members from Philadelphia, Delaware, Chester and Montgomery Counties.  AIA Philadelphia has a history of community engagement.  Activities include helping to create [[Independence National Historical Park]], the Charter High School for Architecture + Design, the Community Design Collaborative, and the Philadelphia Center for Architecture.&lt;ref name=Strategic2012&gt;{{cite web|title=AIA Philadelphia &amp;  Center for Architecture Strategic Plan 2013  – 2017|url=http://www.aaonetwork.org/system/files/resources/Architecture%20Center%20Strategic%20Plan%20-%20AIA%20Philadelphia%20and%20Philadelphia%20Center%20for%20Architecture.pdf|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Claypool became Executive Director of AIA Philadelphia in 2001.&lt;ref name=Massie/&gt; Under his leadership, the Philadelphia Center for Architecture was established as a separate nonprofit with IRS 501(c)(3) status, designating it as an educational non-profit. Its purpose was to support charitable and educational initiatives to benefit the community at large, on behalf of the architectural profession.  It developed programs in the community.&lt;ref name=Strategic2012/&gt;

The Center soon took advantage of the opportunity to create a physical space as well as providing a set of programs.  The Center at 1218 Arch Street opened in 2008.  In 2009 the Chapter and Center boards created a framework to coordinate the two organizations.  The Chapter board holds the authority for annually appointing the Board of the Center. The Center's mission involves engaging "the public, decision leaders, thought leaders, and allied design professionals" on issues related to design and architecture, to recognize and enhance the quality of architecture in the region,&lt;ref name=Strategic2012/&gt; distinct from AIA Philadelphia's mission to provide architects with "opportunities for professional development, service, and collegiality among peers".&lt;ref name=Mission&gt;{{cite web|title=About AIA Philadelphia|url=http://www.aiaphiladelphia.org/about-aia-philadelphia|website=AIA Philadelphia|accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1403">'''Porphyrogeniture''', also sometimes referred to as '''born to the purple''', is a system of political succession that favours the rights of sons born after their father has become king or emperor, over older siblings born before their father's ascent to the throne.

Examples of this practice include [[Byzantium]] and the [[Nupe Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Goody, p.33.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 11th century England and Normandy, the theory of porphyrogeniture was used by [[Henry I of England]] to justify why he, and not his older brother [[Robert Curthose]], should inherit the throne after the death of their brother [[William Rufus]].&lt;ref&gt;Hollister, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Post-War Building Studies''' are a set of [[technical report]]s published by the British [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] starting in 1944.  The Directorate of Post-War Building was established in 1941 under Sir [[James Grey West|James West]]. The Directorate was charged with coordinating solutions for construction of housing to replace homes that had been destroyed as well as homes that had been deferred due to war. The Directorate reported to the Minister of Works, initially [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] then later [[Lord Portal]].   The publications were produced by various committees  (such as the [[Burt Committee]]) composed of architects, engineers, and representatives from the building industry.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bullock ''Building the Post-War World'' Routledge, 2002 ;{{ISBN|041522179X}}  page 195&lt;/ref&gt; The studies standardized non-traditional methods of building construction including the use of pre-fabricated elements and [[poured concrete]]. A new standard system for wiring homes for electricity was described in report no. 11. The reports had a significant impact on the design and construction of buildings in the UK after the war and continue to be cited as references, though their recommendations on [[fire safety]] were later found to be insufficient as apartment buildings became taller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highrisefire.co.uk/leg.html |title= Building Legislation|last= Fishlock |first= Mark |date=10 March 2013 |website= HIGH-RISE Fire Fighting: Developing better responses to fires in tower bocks and high-rise buildings |publisher=Net-Gen |access-date=17 November 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[BS 1363]] [[power socket]] (another product of the studies) has proved long-lasting and is still in use in British homes today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iconeye.com/opinion/icon-of-the-month/item/12383-the-british-plug |title=Icon of the Month: The British plug|last=Jervis |first=John |date=29 January 2016 |website=ICON |publisher=Iconeye |access-date= 17 November 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Damon |date=25 November 2014 |title=Plugging in: Power sockets, standards and the valencies of national habitus |url=http://eprints.brighton.ac.uk/13388/1/Plugging%20In%20-%20Damon%20Taylor%202014.pdf |journal=Journal of Material Culture |volume=20|issue=1 |pages=1-17 |doi=10.1177/1359183514557765 |access-date= 17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While not made part of mandatory building codes and regulations, the reports provided technical guidance and information on application of non-traditional building techniques and materials while overcoming material and labour shortages.

Based on the experience following World War I, it was expected that housing construction demand would be very high after WWII ended, both due to pent-up demand that had not been fulfilled and also due to replacement or repair of housing that had been bombed during the war. Labour and material were expected to be in short supply.  Interest in industrial methods, pre-fabrication and new materials was high during the period between the wars, and such publications as the ''[[Tudor Walters Report]]'' of 1918 gave details on new methods of construction and new materials, including recommendations to improve construction efficiency by better site organisation, increased accuracy of cost accounting, and keeping building trade workers regularly employed. The Directorate of Post-War Building and the Directorate of Building Materials were established by the Ministry of Works.  These groups took on research into new methods and published the ''Post War Building Studies'' in 33 volumes between 1944 and 1946. Experimental work was carried out at the [[Building Research Establishment|Building Research Station]] and reported in the series.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Wall, ''An Architecture of Parts: Architects, Building Workers and Industrialisation in Britain 1940 - 1970'',	Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1135091072}}, pp 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3131">A '''radio latino''' is a measuring instrument used in surveying and military engineering starting in the 16th century.  It gets its name from the inventor, [[Latino Orsini (diplomat)|Latino Orsini]].  The radio latino can be considered a kind of [[geometric square]].&lt;ref&gt;Daumas, Maurice,  ''Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers'', Portman Books, London 1989  {{ISBN|978-0-7134-0727-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a general purpose instrument that could be used for a variety of angular measurements as well as depth and inside dimension measures.

==Usage==
[[File:radio latino.png|thumb|Drawing of a radio latino. The red lines represent viewing angles from the outermost components and the green lines are viewing angles from the end to the outer points on the frame. The diagram leaves out the handle on the free end of the main rod.]]

The slider (blue in the adjacent diagram) could move along the central rod, causing the [[Kite (geometry)|deltoid]] formed by four other rods to change shape symmetrically.  The end points of the rods had sights on them, allowing various sight lines to be defined.  The central rod was [[graduation (instrument)|graduated]] with various scales.  These scales allowed the angles between the end rods (represented by the red lines in the diagram) to be determined as well as the angle with its [[vertex (geometry)|vertex]] at one end of the main rod and sides (represented by the green lines in the diagram) through the outer joints of the rods.

With different graduations, one could determine or lay out:
*angles between sight lines with a degree scale.
*internal angles of [[regular polygon]]s with polygon scales.
*internal diameters and dimensions (such as the inside bore of a cannon) using the distance between the outer joints (represented by the grey dimension lines in the diagram) using a length scale.
*gun elevations for cannon.
*heights of objects by measuring angles.
*[[shadow square]] calculations.
*depths from the free end of the main rod to the slider.

When folded, the radio latino would resemble a sword and was stored in a sheath or [[scabbard]].

==Construction==
The radio latino was usually constructed of [[brass]].  The central, main rod was graduated with multiple scales.  The free end of the main rod had a handle attached.  Within the handle, a small compass was mounted.

The two end-most side rods were shorter than the two attached to the slider.  This permitted the end rods to be set to any angle up to 180°.  The slider could move along the main rod and was used as an index for reading the engraved scales.

Each hinged vertex had a sighting vane.  This permitted the instrument to be used to measure or lay out angles or other dimensions visually.

'''Revision''' is the stage in the [[writing process]] where the [[author]] reviews, alters, and amends their message, according to what has been written in the [[Draft document|draft]]. Revision follows drafting and precedes [[editing]]. Drafting and revising often form a loop as a work moves back and forth between the two stages. It is not uncommon for professional writers to go through many drafts and revisions before successfully creating a written piece that is ready for the next stage: editing. Revision itself is not indicative of the quality of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revision Cognitive and Instructional Processes: Cognitive and Instructional Processes|last=Allal|first=Linda|last2=Chanquoy|first2=L.|last3=Largy|first3=Pierre|publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC|year=2004|isbn=9789401037761|location=New York|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their seminal book, ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', [[William Strunk, Jr.]] and [[E.B. White]] acknowledge the need for revision in the writing process: “Few writers are so expert that they can produce what they are after on the first try. Quite often you will discover, on examining the completed work, that there are serious flaws in the arrangement of the material, calling for [[:wikt:transpose|transposition]]s... do not be afraid to experiment with your text.”

For an essay, a successful revision involves:

'''Identification of thesis'''. The purpose of the essay should be re-considered based on what has been written in the draft. If this purpose differs from the original [[thesis]], the author must decide from which thesis to continue writing.

'''Consideration of structure'''. The author should identify the strengths of the draft, then re-consider the order of those strengths, adjusting their placement as necessary so the work can build with [[Auxesis (figure of speech)|auxesis]] to a [[crescendo]].

'''Uncovering weakness in argument or presentation'''. Once the strengths of the draft have been identified and placed in the strongest order, the author can re-examine the work for weaknesses in argument or presentation. Faulty [[logic]], missing [[Transition words|transitions]], and unsupported  or poorly supported assertions are common weaknesses. Identifying these weaknesses during revision will inform the next draft.

In general, revision of written work can be guided by the following questions:

* Is the writing clear? Does it make sense?
* Is there enough information to describe ideas?
* Is there too much information so that the writing wanders off topic?
* Are the ideas or the narrative flow in a logical order?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beginning Writing Lab|last=Atlee|first=Nancy|publisher=Prufrock Press Inc.|year=1998|isbn=1883055296|location=San Luis, CA|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful revision is not improving [[grammar]] or [[diction]]. Those will be the focus of later editing. However, there are instances when the writer or the author employs a strategy that involves a reviewing process. There are scholarship and theories citing this particular theme such as the case of the three-component model identified by Hayes and Flower&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Effective Learning and Teaching of Writing: A Handbook of Writing in Education|last=Rijlaarsdam|first=|last2=Bergh|first2=Huub|last3=Couzijn|first3=Michel|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|year=2007|isbn=1402027249|location=New York|pages=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the James Britton's model of the writing process as a series of stages described in metaphors of linear growth, conception - incubation - production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Landmark Essays on Writing Process|last=Perl|first=Sondra|publisher=Hermagoras Press|year=1994|isbn=1880393131|location=Davis, CA|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, a review by the writer or a third party, which often entails corrective annotations, is part of the process that leads to the revision stage. Recently, due to the collaborative capabilities offered by the [[Internet]], there are writers who "[[Crowdsourcing|crowdsource]]" reviews from several people, who contribute digital annotations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16364">'''Ronald Jones''' (born July 8, 1952 in the [[United States]]) is an [[artist]], [[critic]] and [[educator]] who gained prominence in [[New York City]] during the mid-1980s. In the magazine ''[[Contemporary (magazine)|Contemporary]]'', [[Brandon Labelle]] wrote: "Working as an artist, writer, curator, professor, lecturer and critic over the last 20 years, Jones is a self-styled [[Conceptual art|Conceptualist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kim Levin |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/art/0019,159644,14858,13.html |title=Masters of the Universe - Page 1 - Art - New York |publisher=Village Voice |date=2000-05-16 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; spanning the worlds of academia and art, opera and garden design, and acting as paternal spearhead of contemporary critical practice. Explorative and provocative, Jones creates work that demands attention that is both perceptual and political."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contemporary-magazines.com/1024x7 ]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Labelle positions Jones along the leading edge of a "contemporary critical practice" that is perhaps best described as [[interdisciplinary]] or [[transdisciplinary]].

==1980s==
Jones graduated in 1974, with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Montomery, Alabama]]'s  [[Huntingdon College]]. He completed an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] degree in sculpture from the [[University of South Carolina]], followed by a [[Ph.D]]. in Interdisciplinary Arts at [[Ohio University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.edu/interarts/ |title=:: School of Interdisciplinary Arts @ Ohio University - Home :: |publisher=Ohio.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he wrote about a collaboration between [[Samuel Beckett]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]]. In 1983, he was included in a group exhibition titled "A Likely Story," at [[Artists space]] in New York City which was curated by Valerie Smith and included [[Gretchen Bender]], [[David Cabrera (artist)|David Cabrera]], and [[Jeff Koons]]. In 1985 he moved to New York City and two years later had his first [[solo exhibition]] at [[Metro Pictures Gallery]]. In the ''[[New York Times]]'', Roberta Smith wrote: "Mr. Jones's main goal seems to be to thwart the eye with formal incoherence and an overload of written information that the mind must digest before his pieces make sense. But the sense made is never visual. Instead, if one wades through the long illustrated paragraph that constitutes each work's title, learning the artwork or event that each component represents, a kind of odd and often frightening poetic logic accrues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Roberta |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DB1539F934A15751C1A967958260 |title=Art in Review - Review - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=1991-12-27 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jones is represented by [[Metro Pictures Gallery]] where his last of six solo shows was in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metropicturesgallery.com/index.php?mode=past |title=Metro Pictures &amp;#124; Exhibitions |publisher=Metropicturesgallery.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527042124/http://www.metropicturesgallery.com/index.php?mode=past |archive-date=2005-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones began his curatorial practice in 1986, when he assembled The Public Art Show with a catalog designed by [[Louise Lawler]] and a poster by [[Barbara Kruger]]. He went on to organize eleven exhibitions for New York City galleries (Metro Pictures, [[Lehmann Maupin]] and [[Josh Baer]]) and European and [[Scandinavia]]ny institutions ("Dark Side of the Moon," Stockholm Cultural Capital of Europe Arkipelag project, 1998 and Magasin 3 Projekt Djurgårdsbrunn, 2003).

In 1987, he began writing criticism for ''[[Arts Magazine]]'' and ''[[Artscribe]]''. Soon after, he began contributing articles, essays and reviews to ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]'', ''[[Artforum]]'', ''Bookforum'', ''Art in America'', ''Parkett'', ''Cabinet'', ''Zone'' and others. Jones wrote numerous catalogs for other artists including Elizabeth Peyton,&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-3-7757-9099-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Laurie Simmons, David Salle, Terry Winters, Richard Phillips, Carroll Dunham, and Keith Edmier.

In 1989 Jones was invited to join the faculty at the School of Art, [[Yale University]] as Critic in Sculpture and ultimately was named Senior Critic.

==1990s==

In 1992 Jones served as the spokesman for the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] peer-review panel for fellowships in sculpture, which launched one of many high-profile national debates on [[censorship]] and First Amendment issues in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honan |first=William H. |author-link=William H.

In 1993 he had a solo exhibition at the [[Sonnabend Gallery]] in New York City. As his work continued to be exhibited internationally (including solo exhibitions in [[Berlin]], [[Tokyo]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Paris]], and [[Cologne]]) Jones was commissioned to design garden projects including [[Pritzker Park]] in Chicago, the Rethymnon Centre of Contemporary Art in Crete, the  [[Botanical Gardens]] in [[Curitiba, Brazil]], [[Caesar’s Cosmic Garden]] [[Boras Konstmuseet]], [[Sweden]] and a garden for the city of [[Hamburg, Germany]] among others.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:jones garden.jpg|thumbnail|left|Pritzker Park, Chicago, Illinois, 1992. Courtesy of the artist.]] --&gt;

In 1995, ArtForum magazine's "Best and Worst 1995" article stated that Jones should be "a nominee for a lifetime achievement award for contemporary-art awfulness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_n4_v34/ai_17837647/ |title=Best and worst 1995 &amp;#124; ArtForum &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 he was appointed professor and Chairman of the Visual Arts Department at [[Columbia University]]. At Columbia he was the Director of the Digital Media Center and Co-Director of the Interactive Design Lab. While at Columbia he served on the faculty of the MA Colloquia in the Masters Program in Critical Studies, Department of Art History and Archeology and taught in seminars at The Computer Music Department.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[File:jones opera.jpg|thumbnail|left|"Falling and Waving," still from opera produced by Brooklyn Academy of Music and Arts at Saint Ann's, New York City, 1999. Courtesy of Metro Pictures and the artist.]]  --&gt;He continued to serve as a Visiting Professor at [[Konstfack]], University College of Arts, Crafts and Design, in Stockholm, Sweden, which he had done since 1996. He served on the Boards of Artists Space, the [[Public Art Fund]], and [[Franklin Furnace]], all in New York City, the Princeton Sculpture Symposium, and was a Member of the Executive Committee of the Lucent Project, [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]].

In 1999, Jones conceived of, and wrote the libretto for "Falling and Waving," the first computer generated opera produced by the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] and Arts at Saint Ann's in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jayscheib.com/falling/index.html |title=Falling and Waving (a digital opera) :::: directed by Jay Scheib |publisher=Jayscheib.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==

In 2001 he was appointed as the first Provost at Art Center College of Design where he guided the design and implementation of a new transdisciplinary curriculum for the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_7_39/ai_75761312 |title=Mix Master - Ronald Jones curriculum - Brief Article &amp;#124; ArtForum &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he earned a Certificate from the Harvard University Graduate School of Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gse.harvard.edu/ |title=Harvard Graduate School of Education |publisher=Gse.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently Jones is Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies at [[Konstfack University College of Arts]], Crafts and Design in Stockholm, Sweden where he leads The [[Experience design|Experience Design]] Group, with a mission "to persuade, stimulate, inform, envision, entertain, and forecast events, influencing meaning and modifying human behavior." &lt;ref&gt;http://varutstallning08.konstfack.se/interdisciplinary-studies/ronald-jones.html{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="designtime.se"&gt;http://www.designtime.se&lt;/ref&gt; At Konstfack, Jones also co-directs WIRE, the MA program in curatorial practice and critical writing.
Jones is a Center Director at Konstfack for the [[Stockholm School of Entrepreneurship]] (SSES), an interdisciplinary initiative by Karolinska Institutet, the Royal Institute of Technology, the Stockholm School of Economics, the Stockholm University and Konstfack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sses.se/ |title=SSES |publisher=Sses.se |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones is a Guest Professor of Experience Design at [[National Institute of Design|NID]], the National Institute of Design, [[Ahmedabad, India]]. He has also served on the faculty of The Royal Danish Academy of Art, Copenhagen, The School of Visual Arts, New York, and [[Staatliche Hochschule für Bildende Künste]], [[Städelschule]] [[Frankfurt, Germany]] and as a visiting professor at [[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design]], Israel's national school of art.
With his appointment at Konstfack as Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies, he has been able, along with the faculty of The Experience Design Group, to create a graduate program especially designed to prepare students to become interdisciplinarians, or even transdisciplinarians. "Interdisciplinarity," says Jones "is by now a stand-alone discipline, as much as the conventional disciplines of art, design or craft."&lt;ref name="designtime.se"/&gt;

==Writing, lectures, collections==

Jones writes regularly for ''[[Artforum]]'' and has a monthly column for ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]''.

He has delivered over two hundred lectures to universities, museums, art and design schools, including Harvard University, The Art Institute of Chicago, Yale University, The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, The [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], The Guggenheim Museum, The Rhode Island School of Design, Parsons School of Design, [[Dia Art Foundation|DIA]] Center for the Arts, New York City, Royal College of Art, London, Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts at MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, Brown University, Akademie Der Bildenden Künste, Vienna, the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]], London, among others.

His art is in the permanent collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]], The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], The [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]], and the [[Moderna Museet]], Stockholm, among others.

In [[computer science]], the '''scientific community metaphor''' is a [[metaphor]] used to aid understanding [[scientific community|scientific communities]].  The first publications on the scientific community metaphor in 1981 and 1982&lt;ref&gt;[[Bill Kornfeld]] and [[Carl Hewitt]] 1981, Kornfeld 1981, Kornfeld 1982&lt;/ref&gt; involved the development of a [[programming language]] named [[Ether (programming language)|Ether]] that invoked procedural plans to process goals and assertions concurrently by dynamically creating new rules during program execution.  Ether also addressed issues of conflict and contradiction with multiple sources of knowledge and multiple viewpoints.

==Development==
The scientific community metaphor builds on the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]], [[history of science|history]] and [[sociology of science]].  It was originally developed building on work in the philosophy of science by [[Karl Popper]] and [[Imre Lakatos]].  In particular, it initially made use of Lakatos' work on [[Imre Lakatos#Proofs and refutations|proofs and refutations]]. Subsequently, development has been influenced by the work of Geof Bowker, [[Michel Callon]], [[Paul Feyerabend]], Elihu M. Gerson, [[Bruno Latour]], [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], [[Karl Popper]], [[Susan Leigh Star]], [[Anselm Strauss]], and [[Lucy Suchman]].

In particular Latour's ''[[Science in Action (book)|Science in Action]]'' had great influence.  In the book, [[Janus (mythology)|Janus]] figures make paradoxical statements about scientific development.  An important challenge for the scientific community metaphor is to reconcile these paradoxical statements.

==Qualities of scientific research==
Scientific research depends critically on monotonicity, concurrency, commutativity, and pluralism to propose, modify, support, and oppose scientific methods, practices, and theories. 
Quoting from Carl Hewitt,{{Ref|hewitt-2006}} scientific community metaphor systems have characteristics of ''monotonicity'', ''concurrency'', ''commutativity'', ''pluralism'', ''skepticism'' and ''provenance''.

:'''monotonicity''': Once something is published it cannot be undone.  Scientists publish their results so they are available to all.  Published work is collected and indexed in libraries.  Scientists who change their mind can publish later articles contradicting earlier ones.

:'''concurrency''': Scientists can work concurrently, overlapping in time and interacting with each other.

:'''commutativity''': Publications can be read regardless of whether they initiate new research or become relevant to ongoing research.  Scientists who become interested in a scientific question typically make an effort to find out if the answer has already been published.  In addition they attempt to keep abreast of further developments as they continue their work.

:'''pluralism''': Publications include heterogeneous, overlapping and possibly conflicting information.  There is no central arbiter of truth in scientific communities.

:'''skepticism''': Great effort is expended to test and validate current information and replace it with better information.

:'''provenance''': The provenance of information is carefully tracked and recorded.

The above characteristics are limited in real scientific communities.  Publications are sometimes lost or difficult to retrieve.  Concurrency is limited by resources including personnel and funding.  Sometimes it is easier to rederive a result than to look it up.  Scientists only have so much time and energy to read and try to understand the literature.  Scientific fads sometimes sweep up almost everyone in a field.  The order in which information is received can influence how it is processed.  Sponsors can try to control scientific activities.  In Ether the semantics of the kinds of activity described in this paragraph are governed by the [[actor model]].

Scientific research includes generating theories and processes for modifying, supporting, and opposing these theories.  [[Karl Popper]] called the process "conjectures and refutations", which although expressing a core insight, has been shown to be too restrictive a characterization by the work of [[Michel Callon]], [[Paul Feyerabend]], Elihu M. Gerson, [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]], [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]], [[George Lakoff]], [[Imre Lakatos]], [[Bruno Latour]], [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], [[Susan Leigh Star]], [[Anselm Strauss]], [[Lucy Suchman]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''etc.''.  Three basic kinds of participation in Ether are proposing, supporting, and opposing.  Scientific communities are structured to support competition as well as cooperation.

These activities affect the adherence to approaches, theories, methods, ''etc.'' in scientific communities.  Current adherence does not imply adherence for all future time.  Later developments will modify and extend current understandings.  Adherence is a local rather than a global phenomenon.  No one speaks for the scientific community as a whole.

Opposing ideas may coexist in communities for centuries.  On rare occasions a community reaches a ''breakthrough''  that clearly decides an issue previously muddled.

==Ether==
Ether used ''viewpoints'' to relativist information in publications.  However a great deal of information is shared across viewpoints.  So Ether made use of ''inheritance'' so that information in a viewpoint could be readily used in other viewpoints.  Sometimes this inheritance is not exact as when the laws of physics in [[Newtonian mechanics]] are derived from those of [[Special Relativity]].  In such cases Ether used ''translation'' instead of inheritance.  [[Bruno Latour]] has analyzed translation in scientific communities in the context of [[actor network theory]].  [[Imre Lakatos]] studied very sophisticated kinds of translations of mathematical (''e.g.'', the [[Euler]] formula for [[polyhedra]]) and scientific theories.

Viewpoints were used to implement natural deduction (Fitch [1952]) in Ether.  In order to prove a goal of the form &lt;tt&gt;(P ''implies'' Q)&lt;/tt&gt; in a viewpoint &lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;, it is sufficient to create a new viewpoint &lt;tt&gt;V'&lt;/tt&gt; that inherits from &lt;tt&gt;V&lt;/tt&gt;, assert &lt;tt&gt;P&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;V'&lt;/tt&gt;, and then prove &lt;tt&gt;Q&lt;/tt&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;V'&lt;/tt&gt;.  An idea like this was originally introduced into programming language proving by Rulifson, Derksen, and Waldinger [1973] except since Ether is concurrent rather than being sequential it does not rely on being in a single viewpoint that can be sequentially pushed and popped to move to other viewpoints.

Ultimately resolving issues among these viewpoints are matters for [[negotiation]] (as studied in the sociology and philosophy of science by Geof Bowker, [[Michel Callon]], [[Paul Feyerabend]], Elihu M. Gerson, [[Bruno Latour]], [[John Law (sociologist)|John Law]], [[Karl Popper]], Susan Leigh Star, Anselm Strauss, Lucy Suchman, etc.).

==Emphasis on communities rather than individuals==
[[Alan Turing]] was one of the first to attempt to more precisely characterize ''individual'' intelligence through the notion of his famous [[Turing Test]].  This paradigm was developed and deepened in the field of [[Artificial Intelligence]].  [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] did pioneer work in analyzing the protocols of individual human problem solving behavior on puzzles.  More recently [[Marvin Minsky]] has developed the idea that the mind of an individual human is composed of a society of agents in [[Society of Mind]] (see the analysis by Push Singh).

The above research on individual human problem solving is ''complementary'' to the scientific community metaphor.

== Current applications==
Some developments in hardware and software technology for the [[Internet]] are being applied in light of the scientific community metaphor.{{Ref|RepeatedDemise|Hewitt 2006|-}}

Legal concerns (''e.g.'', [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]], [[Sarbanes-Oxley]], "The Books and Records Rules"  in SEC Rule 17a-3/4 and  "Design Criteria Standard for Electronic Records Management Software Applications"  in  DOD 5015.2 in the [[United States|U.S.]]) are leading organizations to store information monotonically forever.  It has just now become less costly in many cases to store information on [[disk storage|magnetic disk]] than on tape.  With increasing storage capacity, sites can monotonically record what they read from the Internet as well as monotonically recording their own operations.

[[Search engines]] currently provide rudimentary access to all this information.  Future systems will provide [[question answering|interactive question answering broadly conceived]] that will make all this information much more useful.

Massive [[concurrent computing|concurrency]] (''i.e.,'' [[Web service]]s and [[multi-core (computing)|multi-core]] computer architectures) lies in the future posing enormous challenges and opportunities for the scientific community metaphor. In particular, the scientific community metaphor is being used in client [[cloud computing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.4934 A historical perspective on developing foundations for privacy-friendly client cloud computing: the paradigm shift from “inconsistency denial” to “semantic integration”] ArXiv January 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sheila Sen Jasanoff''' is an [[Indian American]] academic and significant contributor to the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]].

==Early life and education==
Born in India, Jasanoff attended [[Radcliffe College]], where she studied mathematics as an undergraduate, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1964.  She then studied linguistics, receiving her M.A. at the [[University of Bonn]] (then part of West Germany). She returned to Harvard to complete a Ph.D. in linguistics in 1973, and a J.D. at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1976. She practiced environmental law in Boston from 1976 to 1978. She and her husband then accepted positions at [[Cornell University]], where she became a pioneer in the newly emerging field of Science and Technology Studies. In 1998, Jasanoff joined the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] as a professor of public policy. In 2002, she became Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies.&lt;ref name=Crimson2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Le|first1=Quynh-Nhu|title=Sheila S.

==Work==
Jasanoff founded and directs the Program on Science, Technology, and Society at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=Director&gt;{{cite web|title=Director: Sheila Jasanoff|url=http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/people/director.html|website=Program on Science, Technology &amp; Society|publisher=Kennedy School of Government Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research focuses on science and the state in contemporary democratic societies.  Her work is relevant to science &amp; technology studies, comparative politics, law and society, political and legal anthropology, sociology and policy analysis.  Jasanoff's research has considerable empirical breadth, spanning the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the European Union, and India, as well as emerging global regimes in areas such as climate and biotechnology.

One line of Jasanoff's work demonstrates how the political culture of different democratic societies influences how they assess evidence and expertise in policymaking.  Her first book (with Brickman and Ilgen), ''Controlling Chemicals'' (1985), examines the regulation of toxic substances in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Brickman, Ilgen, and Jasanoff, ''Controlling Chemicals''.  Cornell University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book showed how the routines of decision making in these countries reflected different conceptions of what counts as evidence and of how expertise should operate in a policy context.  In ''Designs on Nature: Science and Democracy in Europe and the United States'' (2005), she has shown how different societies employ different modes of public reasoning when making decisions involving science and technology.&lt;ref name=Ezrahi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ezrahi|first1=Yaron|title=Controlling Biotechnology: Science, Democracy and 'Civic Epistemology'|journal=Metascience|date=7 May 2008|volume=17|issue=2|pages=177–198|doi=10.1007/s11016-008-9201-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, ''Designs on Nature: Science and Democracy in Europe and the United States'', Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;   These differences, which in part reflect distinct "civic epistemologies," are deeply embedded in institutions and shape how policy issues are framed and processed by the bureaucratic machinery of  modern states.

Jasanoff has also contributed to scholarship on the interaction of science and law.  ''Science at the Bar'' (1995), for example, reached beyond the prevailing diagnoses of structural incompatibilities between science and law to explore how these socially embedded institutions interact and, to a certain extent, mutually constitute each other.&lt;ref name=Keniston&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keniston|first1=Kenneth|title=Book Review Science at the Bar: Law, science, and technology in America By Sheila Jasanoff. 285 pp. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1995. $29.95. 0-674-79302-1|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=9 May 1996|volume=334|issue=19|pages=1274–1274|doi=10.1056/NEJM199605093341918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, ''Science at the Bar'', Harvard University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of regulatory science, conducted for the purposes of meeting legally mandated standards, and the "boundary" drawing activities of science advisory committees are analyzed in ''The Fifth Branch'' (1990).&lt;ref name=Burger&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burger|first1=Edward J.|title=Book Review The Fifth Branch: Science advisers as policy-makers By Sheila Jasanoff. 302 pp. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1990. $27.95.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=23 May 1991|volume=324|issue=21|pages=1518–1518|doi=10.1056/NEJM199105233242124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, ''The Fifth Branch: Science Advisors as Policymakers'', Harvard University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;   More recently, she has explored the "rise of the statistical victim" in toxic torts, as the law with its individualistic orientation has increasingly encountered, and sought ways to accommodate, the statistical vision of such fields as epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, "Science and the Statistical Victim: Modernizing Knowledge in Breast Implant Litigation," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 32, No. 1 (Feb., 2002), pp. 37-69.&lt;/ref&gt; In her work on science and law, as well as her research on science in the state, she takes an approach that links ideas from constitutional law, political theory, and science studies to consider the "constitutional" role of science in modern democratic states.&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, "In a Constitutional Moment," in ''Social Studies of Science and Technology: Looking back, Ahead'' (Bernward Joerges &amp; Helga Nowotny, eds., 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasanoff  has considered the [[politics of science]] not only in a comparative but also in a global context.  Examples include her work on the transnational aspects of the [[Bhopal disaster]] (''Learning from Disaster'' 1994);&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Oran R.|title=International cooperation : building regimes for natural resources and the environment|date=1989|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, Ny|isbn=978-0801495212|edition=3rd reprint.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U92Nw5FnGLsC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; her research on the formation and politics of global scientific advisory bodies such as the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]; and her research on national and global environmental movements (e.g., Earthy Politics, 2004).&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Eric|title=Why we argue about climate change|date=2013|publisher=Black Inc.|location=Melbourne|isbn=9781863956086|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7X6f5d9w_tkC&amp;pg=PT31|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jasanoff also has contributed to building Science and Technology Studies as a field.  Prior to moving to Harvard, she was the founding chair of the [http://sts.cornell.edu/ Department of Science &amp; Technology Studies] at Cornell University.  She is also the founder of the [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/sdn/ Science &amp; Democracy Network], a group of scholars interested in the study of science and the state in democratic societies that has met annually since 2002.   Her research has been recognized with many awards, including the Bernal Prize from the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Albert O. Hirschman Prize from the [[Social Science Research Council]].

==Personal==
She is married to [[Jay H. Jasanoff]], and has two children, [[Maya Jasanoff]], who is a professor in the Department of History at Harvard, and [[Alan Jasanoff]], who is a professor in the Department of Biological Engineering at [[MIT]]&lt;ref name="Crimson2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarvardMagazine"/&gt;

SGR was developed in the Arup Hong Kong office and is derived from design practice, observations and collective research on [[East Asia]]’s energetic [[Urbanization|urbanisation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research - China’s Rapid Urbanization: Benefits, Challenges &amp; Strategies|url = http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:21812803~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html|website = econ.worldbank.org|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now regarded as a key component of Hong Kong's city strategy.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hk2030plus.hk/document/2030+_Pamphlet_English.pdf|title=Public Engagement Pamphlet for Hong Kong's 2030+ planning vision and strategy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SGR planning approach is based on observations of East Asia’s rapid urbanisation processes that have left many cities and landscapes in the region vulnerable to climate change, environmental degradation and socioeconomic fluctuations. The approach espouses the holistic resolution of critical issues pertinent to contemporary cities with an equal focus on the organization of urban systems and their management as well as physical design (including infrastructure and buildings.)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Smart Green Resilient|author1=Lau, Wilfred |author2=Romanos, Christoforos |author3=Chong, Bruce |publisher = Arup|year = 2015|isbn = 9789881492302|location = Hong Kong|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to recent public discussions on the merits of SGR,&lt;ref&gt;''YEUNG, Theresa''.

Presentation entitled “A Smart Green Resilient Aerotropolis”, International Summit Conference on the Development of Aerotropolis, Taipei, Taiwan, April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the combined use of the terms “[[Smart city|smart]]”, “[[Green cities|green]]” and “[[Climate resilience|resilient]]” is derived from the proliferation of similar terminologies in current urban practice aiming to guide the transformation of urban environments into “Smart Cities”, “Resilient Cities” or combinations thereof. However, SGR does not aim to replace other planning approaches but instead is considered necessary to coordinate the often multidisciplinary nature of collaborative city-building and to maximize benefits to urban residents, businesses and governments.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Lau, Wilfred;'' Lecture entitled [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETBvwCGTJ9s “Towards Smart Green Resilient Cities”] (See the link for the video clip of presentation on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETBvwCGTJ9s Youtube] or from Arup's official [http://video.arup.com/?v=1_lgoyzv4z website for full version]), Hong Kong Polytechnic University, October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Arup {{!}} Thoughts {{!}} Urban planning needs a new direction, January 2016|url = http://thoughts.arup.com/post/details/518/urban-planning-needs-a-new-direction|website = thoughts.arup.com|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The key ideas behind SGR were initially conceived in 2008 and formally consolidated in January 2014. The phrase “Smart Green Resilient” (or “SGR”) first appears in this form to describe the holistic planning approach employed to advise the government of Taoyuan on the strategic master plan for North Taiwan’s Taoyuan Aerotropolis.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Event Reports - EUROPEAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TAIWAN - Friday, 18 October 2013|url = http://www.ecct.com.tw/events_reportdetail.aspx?pcseq=4&amp;cseq=70&amp;seq=971|website = www.ecct.com.tw|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Intelligent Community Forum (ICF)|url = https://www.intelligentcommunity.org/index.php?src=gendocs&amp;ref=BrainGain_Sponsors&amp;link=BrainGain_Sponsors|website = www.intelligentcommunity.org|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 航空城吸引港議員率企業來台　聚焦綠建築智慧城投資商機 -  - 華視新聞網; 22 October 2014|url = http://news.cts.com.tw/nownews/society/201410/201410221523786.html#.VbmhMvmqpBc|website = 華視新聞網|access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then SGR has been the subject of lectures, presentations and research papers outlining the concerns as well as the solutions and direction that urban planning should adopt.&lt;ref&gt;''Chong, Bruce et al.'' “From Smart to Smart-Green-Resilient City planning” (從“智慧”到“智慧-綠色-韌性), Annual China Urban Planning Conference, Hai Kou, Hainan, 2014, ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.planning.org.cn/thesis/view?id=7697&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Published in 2015, the book entitled Smart Green Resilient, traces the development of the concept since 2008 beginning with the Ninh Thuan Integrated Development Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.arup.com/Projects/Ninh_Thuan.aspx|title = Ninh Thuan Integrated Development Plan|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and followed by the planning study for Hong Kong’s Lok Ma Chau Loop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.news.gov.hk/en/categories/infrastructure/html/2013/07/20130718_195352.shtml|title = Lok Ma Chau Loop|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on smart city and sustainable development principles. The book summarises the growth of environmental awareness and the different ways cities and planners have responded to these escalating challenges over the recent past. The book also outlines some of the main elements that characterise the SGR approach, various applications in project work and sources of inspiration from global geographies.

As of 2016-2017, the phrase “Smart Green and Resilient” has been adopted by Hong Kong’s Planning Department and Development Bureau to describe the 2030+ planning vision for the city.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hk2030plus.hk/document/Hong%20Kong%202030+%20A%20SGR%20City%20Strategy_Eng.pdf|title=Hong Kong 2030+: A Smart, Green and Resilient City Strategy, October 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.hk2030plus.hk/explore.asp?form=31|publisher=Hong Kong Planning Department|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Reference to Smart Green Resilient is also made in relation to the New Territories North development in Hong Kong, where the approach is intended to enable "a low-carbon environment equipped with smart city infrastructure and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/community/article/2134514/350000-people-could-live-one-hong-kongs-last-untouched|title=Up to 350,000 people could live in one of Hong Kong’s last untouched areas, study finds|last=Ng|first=Naomi|date=24 February 2018|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=26 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

== Themes ==
The SGR planning approach is characterized by various themes that range from identification of critical urban issues to their collaborative resolution, usually by large multidisciplinary groups that can include engineers, residents, economists, city administrators, environmentalists etc.

=== Current Planning Solutions ===
A key thesis of SGR involves the limitations inherent in current planning approaches including Smart City, Resilient City, Ubiquitous City, Wise City etc. While there are merits in each of these directions, none of them present a holistic design system that takes into consideration the complexity of urban networks and their social, economic and cultural dimensions. This lays the groundwork for an alternative approach to urban planning that can shed light into wider issues and incorporate comprehensive solutions that are intended to multiply the benefits for city residents. In the SGR approach for example, the term “resilience” is not limited to climate adaptation but equally embraces the adaptability of physical infrastructure as well as economic and social resilience.

=== Cognitive Prism ===
SGR is not intended to present a prescriptive methodology for urban planning. In contrast to many urban planning approaches, SGR seeks to reveal the relationships between critical issues by interrogating already identified concerns through different lenses. As such SGR is described as a “cognitive prism” through which “urban planners can gain a holistic view of the challenges they need to address.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Three Elements of SGR&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ===
Three important elements characterize the SGR planning approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''People Oriented''' that advocates designing for end users, the need to broaden stakeholder engagement, formulate broad alliances with concerned parties and realize community benefits;
* '''Contemporary Relevance''' espousing the importance of addressing current issues through the use of a composite systems approach that can lay the foundation for a structured long-term implementation as well as revealing territorial relationships;
* '''Future Proofing''' that supports capacity-building, the utilization of appropriate technology and scenario-testing to secure plans have adequate built-in flexibility to adapt under various conditions.

== See also ==
Over the recent past, researchers, industrial practitioners, bloggers, and interested groups have also promulgated their thoughts around concepts that utilize the terms “smart”, “green” and “resilient” by combining “S”, “G” and “R” into “SG”, “SR” or GR”. It should be noted that these do not form part of the SGR planning approach.

{{Semiotics}}
'''Social semiotics''' (also '''social semantics''')&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thibault, ''Agency and Consciousness in Discourse: Self-Other Dynamics as a Complex System'', Continuum, 2004, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of the field of [[semiotics]] which investigates human signifying practices in specific social and cultural circumstances, and which tries to explain [[meaning-making]] as a social practice. Semiotics, as originally defined by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], is "the science of the life of signs in society". Social semiotics expands on Saussure's founding insights by exploring the implications of the fact that the "codes" of language and communication are formed by social processes. The crucial implication here is that meanings and semiotic systems are shaped by relations of power, and that as power shifts in society, our languages and other systems of socially accepted meanings can and do change.

Social semiotics is thus the study of the social dimensions of meaning, and of the power of human processes of signification and interpretation (known as semiosis) in shaping individuals and societies. Social semiotics focuses on [[social meaning-making]] practices of all types, whether visual, verbal or aural in nature (Thibault, 1991). These different systems for meaning-making, or possible "channels" (e.g. speech, writing, images) are known as semiotic modes. Semiotic modes can include visual, verbal, written, gestural and musical resources for communication. They also include various "multimodal" ensembles of any of these modes (Kress and van Leeuwen, 2001).

Social semiotics can include the study of how people design and interpret meanings, the study of texts, and the study of how semiotic systems are shaped by social interests and ideologies, and how they are adapted as society changes (Hodge and Kress, 1988). Structuralist semiotics in the tradition of Ferdinand de Saussure focused primarily on theorising semiotic systems or structures (termed ''[[Langue and parole|langue]]'' by de Saussure, which change diachronically, i.e. over longer periods of time). In contrast, social semiotics tries to account for the variability of semiotic practices termed ''[[Langue and parole|parole]]'' by Saussure. This altered focus shows how individual creativity, changing historical circumstances, and new social identities and projects can all change patterns of usage and design (Hodge and Kress, 1988). From a social semiotic perspective, rather than being fixed into unchanging "codes", signs are considered to be resources which people use and adapt (or "design") to make meaning. In these respects, social semiotics was influenced by, and shares many of the preoccupations of [[pragmatics]] and [[sociolinguistics]] and has much in common with [[cultural studies]] and [[critical discourse analysis]].

The main task of social semiotics is to develop analytical and theoretical frameworks which can explain meaning-making in a social context (Thibault, 1991).

==Halliday and the social semiotic in language==
Linguistic theorist, [[Michael Halliday]], introduced the term ‘social semiotics’ into linguistics, when he used the phrase in the title of his book, ''Language as Social Semiotic''. This work argues against the traditional separation between language and society, and exemplifies the start of a 'semiotic' approach, which broadens the narrow focus on written language in linguistics (1978).
For Halliday, languages evolve as systems of "meaning potential" (Halliday, 1978:39) or as sets of resources which influence what the speaker can do with language, in a particular social context. For example, for Halliday, the grammar of the English language is a system organised for the following three purposes (areas or "metafunctions"):
* Facilitating certain kinds of social and interpersonal interactions (interpersonal),
* Representing ideas about the world (ideational), and
* Connecting these ideas and interactions into meaningful texts and making them relevant to their context (textual) (1978:112).
Any sentence in English is composed like a musical composition, with one strand of its meaning coming from each of the three semiotic areas or metafunctions.  
[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Bob Hodge]] generalises Halliday’s essays &lt;ref&gt;Review of Language as Social Semiotic: The Social Interpretation of Language and Meaning by M. A.K. Halliday, reviewer: Greg Urban, University of Texas at Austin, American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 83, No. 3 (Sep., 1981), pp. 659-661, Blackwell Publishing on behalf of the American Anthropological Association https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~gurban/pdfs/reviews/Urban-Language_as_Social_Semiotic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; on social semiotics into five premises:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semioticon.com/seo/S/social_semiotics.html#  Social Semiotics] - Semiotics Encyclopedia Online, E.J. Pratt Library, Victoria University, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ‘Language is a social fact’ (1978:1)
# ‘We shall not come to understand the nature of language if we pursue only the kinds of question about language that are formulated by linguists’ (1978:3)
#‘Language is as it is because of the functions it has evolved to serve in people’s lives’ (1978:4).
# Language has ‘metafunctions’, which in English are: ideational (‘about something’), interpersonal (’doing something’) and textual (‘the speaker’s text-forming potential’) (1978:112).
# Language is constituted as ‘a discrete network of options’ (1978:113)

==Social semiotics and critical linguistics==
[[Bob Hodge (linguist)|Robert Hodge]] and [[Gunther Kress]]'s ''Social Semiotics'' (1988) focused on the uses of semiotic systems in social practice. They explain that the social power of texts in society depends on interpretation: "Each producer of a message relies on its recipients for it to function as intended." (1988:4) This process of interpretation (semiosis) situates individual texts within discourses, the exchanges of interpretative communities. The work of interpretation can contest the power of hegemonic discourses. Hodge and Kress give the example of feminist activists defacing a sexist advertising billboard, and spray-painting it with a new, feminist message.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Text is only a trace of discourses, frozen and preserved, more or less reliable or misleading. Yet discourse disappears too rapidly, surrounding a flow of texts." (1988:8)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Hodge and Kress built on a range of traditions from linguistics (including [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Michael Halliday]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] and [[sociolinguistics]]), but the major impetus for their work is the critical perspective on ideology and society that originates with [[Marx]].

Hodge and Kress build a notion of semiosis as a dynamic process, where meaning is not determined  by rigid structures, or predefined cultural codes. They argue that [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s structuralist semiotics avoided addressing questions about creativity, movement, and change in language, possibly in reaction to the diachronic linguistic traditions of his time (the focus on the historical development from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]). This created a "problematic" legacy, with linguistic change relegated to the "contents of Saussure’s rubbish bin" (1988:16-17).

Instead, Hodge and Kress propose to account for change in semiosis through the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Meaning is a process, in their interpretation of Peirce. They refer to Peirce's triadic model of semiosis, which depicts the "action" of a sign as a limitless process of infinite semiosis, where one "interpretant" (or idea linked to a sign) generates another. The flow of these infinite processes of interpretation are constrained in Peirce's model, they claim, by the material world (the "object"), and cultural rules of thought, or "habit". (1988:20)

Social semiotics revisits De Saussure's doctrine of the "arbitrariness of the linguistic [[Sign (linguistics)|sign]]". This notion rests on the argument that the signifier only has an [[arbitrary]] relationship to the signified) — in other words, that there is nothing about the sound or appearance of (verbal) signifiers (as, for example, the words "dog" or "chien") — to suggest what they signify. Hodge and Kress point out that questions of the [[referent]] become more complicated when semiotics moves beyond verbal language. On the one hand, there is the need to account for the continuum of relationships between the [[referent]] and the representation. Here, they draw on Pierce's differentiation between iconic signification (e.g. a colour photograph of smoke, where the signifier recreates the perceptual experience of the signified), indexical signification (e.g. a column of smoke, where there is a causal relationship between the physical signifier and the fire it might signify), and symbolic signification (e.g. the word "smoke", where the arbitrary link between signifier and signified is maintained by social convention).

Social semiotics also addresses the question of how societies and cultures maintain or shift these conventional bonds between signifier and signified. De Saussure was unwilling to answer this question, Hodge and Kress claim. This leaves the [[socially determinist]] implication that meanings and interpretations are dictated from above, by "the whims of an inscrutably powerful collective being, Society." For Hodge and Kress, social semiotics must respond to the question and  explain how the social shaping of meanings works in practice (1988:22).

==Social semiotics and multimodality==
Social semiotics is currently extending this general framework beyond its linguistic origins to account for the growing importance of sound and visual images, and how modes of communication are combined in both traditional and digital media ([[semiotics of social networking]]) (see, for example, Kress and van Leeuwen, 1996), thus approaching semiotics of culture (Randviir 2004). Theorists such as Gunther Kress and [[Theo Van Leeuwen|Theo van Leeuwen]] have built on Halliday's framework by providing new "grammars" for other semiotic modes. Like language, these grammars are seen as socially formed and changeable sets of available "resources" for making meaning, which are also shaped by the semiotic metafunctions originally identified by Halliday. The visual and aural modes have received particular attention. Accounting for [[multimodality]] (communication in and across a range of semiotic modes - verbal, visual, and aural) is considered a particularly important ongoing project, given the importance of the visual mode in contemporary communication.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6877">'''Sociometry''' is a quantitative method for measuring social relationships. It was developed by [[psychotherapy|psychotherapist]] [[Jacob L. Moreno]] and [[Helen Hall Jennings]] in their studies of the relationship between social  structures and [[psychological]] well-being, and used during Remedial Teaching.

==Definition==

The term sociometry relates to its [[Latin]] [[etymology]], ''socius'' meaning companion, and ''metrum'' meaning measure.  Jacob Moreno defined sociometry as "the inquiry into the evolution and organization of groups and the position of individuals within them." He goes on to write "As the ...science of group organization, it attacks the problem not from the outer structure of the group, the group surface, but from the inner structure"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who Shall Survive|last=Moreno|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. "Sociometric explorations reveal the hidden structures that give a group its form: the alliances, the subgroups, the hidden beliefs, the forbidden agendas, the ideological agreements, the ‘stars’ of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forbidden Agendas - Strategic Action In Groups|last=Williams|first=Antony|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=0-415-04402-2|location=|pages=127-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Moreno developed sociometry within the new sciences, although its ultimate purpose is transcendence and not science. 'By making choices based on criteria, overt and energetic, Moreno hoped that individuals would be more spontaneous, and organisations and groups structures would become fresh, clear and lively.'  
 
One of Moreno's innovations in sociometry was the development of the '''[[sociogram]]''', a systematic method for graphically representing individuals as points/nodes and the relationships between them as lines/arcs.&lt;ref&gt;Moreno (1934), ''Who Shall Survive?''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreno, who wrote extensively of his thinking, applications and findings, also founded a journal entitled ''Sociometry.''

Within [[sociology]], sociometry has two main branches: research sociometry, and applied sociometry. Research sociometry is action research with groups exploring the socio-emotional networks of relationships using specified criteria e.g. Who in this group do you want to sit beside you at work? Who in the group do you go to for advice on a work problem? Who in the group do you see providing satisfying leadership in the pending project? Sometimes called network explorations, research sociometry is concerned with relational patterns in small (individual and small group) and larger populations, such as organizations and neighborhoods. 
Applied sociometrists utilize a range of methods to assist people and groups review, expand and develop their existing psycho-social networks of relationships. Both fields of sociometry exist to produce through their application, greater spontaneity and creativity of both individuals and groups.

==Moreno's criteria for sociometric tests==
In ''Sociometry, Experimental Method and the Science of Society: An Approach to a New Political Orientation'' (1951), Moreno describes the depth to which a group needs to go for the method to be "sociometric".  The term for him had a qualitative meaning and did not apply unless some group process criteria were met.  One of these is that there is acknowledgment of the difference between process dynamics and the manifest content. To quote Moreno: "there is a deep discrepancy between the official and the secret behavior of members".&lt;ref name="soc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moreno|first1=Jacob Levy|title=Sociometry, Experimental Method and the Science of Society: An Approach to a New Political Orientation|date=1951|publisher=Beacon House}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}} Moreno advocates that before any "social program" can be proposed, the sociometrist has to "take into account the actual constitution of the group."&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt;{{rp|39}}

Other criteria include the rule of adequate motivation: "Every participant should feel about the experiment that it is in his (or her) own cause ... that it is an opportunity for him (or her) to become an active agent in matters concerning his (or her) life situation." and the Rule of "gradual" inclusion of all extraneous criteria.&lt;ref name="soc"/&gt;{{rp|116}}

==Anthropological applications==
Given that sociometry is concerned with group allegiances and cleavages, it is not surprising that sociometric methods have been used to study ethnic relationships and way individuals identify with ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, H.H. 1987. ''Sociometry in Group Relations''. 2nd ed. Westport: Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, using sociometric research, Joan Criswell investigated white-black relationships in US classrooms,&lt;ref&gt;Criswell, J. 1937. Racial Cleavages in Negro-White Groups. ''Sociometry''. 1(1): 87-89; and 1939 ''A Sociometric Study of Racial Cleavages in the Classroom'' Psychology Archives Series, #235. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel Weimann researched ethnic relationships in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Weimann, G. 1983. The Not-So-Small World: Ethnicity and Acquaintance Networks in Israel. ''Social Networks''. 5(3): 289-302.&lt;/ref&gt; and James Page has investigated intra-ethnic and inter-ethnic identification within the Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;Page, J. 1988/9. Education and Acculturation on Malaita: An Ethnography of Intra-ethnic and Inter-ethnic Affinities. ''Journal of Intercultural Studies''. 15/16:74-81. Online: http://eprints.qut.edu.au/3566/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other approaches and software==
Other approaches were developed in last decades, such as [[Social network|social network analysis]], or [[sociomapping]]. Freeware as well as commercial software was developed for analysis of groups and their structure, such as Gephi, Pajek, Keyhubs or InFlow. All these approaches share much of their basic principles with Sociometry.
[[Facebook]] is a [[social network service]] and website which is largely based on the sociometry of its users.

'''Somatic fusion''', also called '''protoplast fusion''', is a type of [[genetic modification]] in plants by which two distinct species of plants are fused together to form a new [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] plant with the characteristics of both, a '''somatic hybrid'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Somatic Cell Hybridization|first1=K.

Uses of somatic fusion include making potato plants resistant to [[Potato leafroll virus|potato leaf roll disease]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Applications in animal cells==

[[Somatic cell]]s of different types can be fused to obtain hybrid cells. Hybrid cells are useful in a variety of ways, e.g.,

(i) to study the control of [[cell division]] and [[gene expression]],

(ii) to investigate [[malignant transformation]]s,

(iii) to obtain [[viral replication]],

(iv) for [[Gene mapping|gene]] or [[chromosome map]]ping and for

(v) production of [[monoclonal antibodies]] by producing [[Hybridoma technology|hybridoma]] (hybrid cells between an immortalised cell and an [[antibody]] producing [[lymphocyte]]), etc.

Chromosome mapping through somatic cell hybridization is essentially based on fusion of human and [[mouse]] somatic cells. Generally, human [[fibrocyte]]s or [[White blood cells|leucocytes]] are fused with mouse continuous [[cell line]]s.

When human and mouse cells (or cells of any two [[mammal]]ian species or of the same species) are mixed, spontaneous [[cell fusion]] occurs at a very low rate (10-6). Cell fusion is enhanced 100 to 1000 times by the addition of [[ultraviolet]] inactivated [[Sendai virus|Sendai]] (parainfluenza) virus or [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG).

These agents adhere to the [[plasma membrane]]s of cells and alter their properties in such a way that facilitates their fusion. Fusion of two cells produces a heterokaryon, i.e., a single hybrid cell with two nuclei, one from each of the cells entering fusion. Subsequently, the two nuclei also fuse to yield a hybrid cell with a single nucleus.

A generalized scheme for somatic cell hybridization may be described as follows. Appropriate human and mouse cells are selected and mixed together in the presence of inactivated Sendai virus or PEG to promote cell fusion. After a period of time, the cells (a mixture of man, mouse and 'hybrid' cells) are plated on a [[selective medium]], e.g., [[HAT medium]], which allows the [[multiplication]] of hybrid cells only.

Several [[clone (cell biology)|clone]]s (each derived from a single hybrid cell) of the hybrid cells are thus isolated and subjected to both [[Cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] and appropriate [[Biochemical analysis|biochemical analyses]] for the detection of [[enzyme]]/ [[protein]]/[[trait (biology)|trait]] under investigation. An attempt is now made to correlate the presence and absence of the trait with the presence and absence of a [[human chromosome]] in the hybrid clones.

If there is a perfect [[correlation]] between the presence and absence of a human chromosome and that of a trait in the hybrid clones, the gene governing the trait is taken to be located in the concerned chromosome.

The HAT medium is one of the several selective media used for the selection of hybrid cells. This medium is supplemented with [[hypoxanthine]], [[aminopterin]] and [[thymidine]], hence the name HAT medium. [[Antimetabolite]] aminopterin blocks the cellular [[biosynthesis]] of [[purine]]s and [[pyrimidine]]s from [[simple sugar]]s and [[amino acid]]s.

However, normal human and mouse cells can still multiply as they can utilize hypoxanthine and thymidine present in the medium through a [[salvage pathway]], which ordinarily recycles the purines and pyrimidines produced from degradation of [[nucleic acid]]s.

Hypoxanthine is converted into [[guanine]] by the enzyme [[hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase]] (HGPRT), while thymidine is [[Phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] by [[thymidine kinase]] (TK); both HGPRT and TK are enzymes of the salvage pathway.

On a HAT medium, only those cells that have active HGPRT (HGPRT+) and TK (TK+) enzymes can proliferate, while those deficient in these enzymes (HGPRr- and/or TK-) can not divide (since they cannot produce purines and pyrimidines due to the aminopterin present in the HAT medium).

For using HAT medium as a selective agent, [[human cell]]s used for fusion must be deficient for either the enzyme HGPRT or TK, while mouse cells must be deficient for the other enzyme of this pair. Thus, one may fuse HGPRT deficient human cells (designated as TK+ HGPRr-) with TK deficient mouse cells (denoted as TK- HGPRT+).

Their fusion products (hybrid cells) will be TK+ (due to the human [[gene]]) and HGPRT+ (due to the mouse gene) and will multiply on the HAT medium, while the man and mouse cells will fail to do so. Experiments with other selective media can be planned in a similar fashion.

==Characteristics of somatic hybridization and cybridization ==

# Somatic cell fusion appears to be the only means through which two different parental [[genome]]s can be [[Genetic recombination|recombined]] among plants that cannot [[Sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] (asexual or sterile).
# Protoplasts of sexually sterile ([[haploid]], [[triploid]], and [[aneuploid]]) plants can be fused to produce fertile [[diploid]]s and [[polyploid]]s.
# Somatic cell fusion overcomes sexual incompatibility barriers. In some cases somatic hybrids between two incompatible plants have also found application in [[industry]] or [[agriculture]].
# Somatic cell fusion is useful in the study of cytoplasmic genes and their activities and this information can be applied in [[plant breeding]] experiments.

'''Soviet Orientalist studies in Islam''' are academic discourses by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoreticians about [[Islam]], its origins and development based on [[historical materialism]] and [[Muslims]]. The central question of this discourse was how Muslim society would fit into the general [[World History|development of human history]]. Prominent Soviet [[Oriental studies|orientalists]] include Mikhail A. Reisner, Evgenii Beliaev, Liutsian I. Klimovich, Mikhail L. Tomara, V. Ditiakin and Sandzhar D. Asfendiarov.&lt;ref name="The Soviet Discourse on the Origin and
Class Character of Islam, 1923-1933"&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/brill/dwi/2009/00000049/00000001], Die Welt des Islams, Volume 49, Number 1, 2009 , pp. 1-48(48)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[October Revolution]] brought the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] to power. The Soviet Union had a large [[Islam in the Soviet Union|Muslim population]] of various ethnicities. Therefore, there was a pressing need for original research as [[Karl Marx|Marx]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/letters/53_06_02.htm], Marx To Engels In Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1853/letters/53_06_06.htm], Engels To Marx In London.&lt;/ref&gt; only dealt with the subject superficially. In the 1920s, the Bolsheviks created new institutions and organizations intended to produce devoted Marxist scholars of Oriental studies. Foremost among them was the [[Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies|Moscow Institute for Oriental Studies]], a [[Communist Party|party]] school created in 1920 mainly for the requirements of the Soviet foreign service. Its counterpart for educating party workers and administrators from the Eastern regions and republics of Russia and the USSR, as well as for training communists from abroad, was the [[Communist University of the Toilers of the East|Communist University of the Toilers of the Orient]], a school founded in 1921. The new Marxist discourse on Islam was dominated by scholars from these political teaching and research institutions.

==Communist theory of Islam==
In 1923, Zinatullah Navshirvanov (a Volga Tatar communist who was also active in the formation of a communist party in Atatürk's new Republic of Turkey) in the journal Novyi Vostok&lt;ref&gt;“Kommunisticheskie techeniia v istorii musul’manskoi kul’tury”, in: Novyi Vostok No. 4 (1923), 274-279.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that there were several forms of communism in Islamic history. The authors detected a “primitive communism” already in the activities of some of [[Sahaba|Muhammad's companions]], but they found that communism was even more prominent in the tradition of Islamic [[Sufism]]. Under the cover of Sufism communist ideas and movements emerged that had nothing to do with Islam and religion whatsoever. These movements were driven by Muslims—poor [[nomad]]s as well as [[peasant]]s and [[Artisan|urban craftsmen]]—longing to overthrow the [[Feudalism|feudal order]] of their times, i.e., the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljukid]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman dynasties]] in the [[Near East]]. As examples the Navshirvanovs mentioned the [[Shiism|Shiʿi]] [[Ismailism|Ismailites]], the Anatolian Futūwa and Akhī organizations, and the [[Bektashi|Bektashi order of dervishes]]. The climax of this supposed anti-feudal Sufi communist movement was [[Sheikh Bedreddin]] of Simavna who was executed by the Ottomans in 1416 as a heretic; his disciples led peasant rebellions against Ottoman rule and set up what the Navshirvanov called the “first revolutionary government of Anatolia”.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Navshirvanovy, “Kommunisticheskie techeniia”, 276-278 ff. Cf. Ahmet N. Cerrahoğlu, Şeyh Bedreddin ve Türkiye’de sosyalizm hareketleri (Istanbul, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory suffered from lack of sufficient historical evidence and was superseded by other theories.

==Trade capitalism theory==
Mikhail A. Reisner (Michael von Reusner, 1868–1928), ethnic German historian of law and publicist produced a detailed Marxist analysis of the [[Koran]] from the perspective of [[social studies]]. His interpretation of Islam can be found in two articles on “The Koran and Its Social Ideology”, published in 1926 in a Soviet literary journal.&lt;ref&gt;M. Reisner, “Koran i ego sotsial’naia ideologiia”, part I, in: Krasnaia nov’, 1926, vol.8, 134-149; continuation as part II in: Krasnaia nov’, 1926, vol. 9, 146-164. were later included in his comparative book on “Eastern Ideologies”: M. Reisner, Ideologii vostoka: Ocherki vostochnoi teokratii (Moscow; Leningrad, 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; In these studies Reisner maintained that Islam was the religion of the Arab merchants of [[Mecca]]. He distinguished between the big merchants, that is, the rich families of Mecca, and the less affluent and poor merchant families. Due to the disunion of the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arab tribes]], [[Trade route|trade caravans]] were constantly running the risk of being raided by nomads. These [[Convoy|caravan]]s were organized as joint ventures of rich and less affluent trade families of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe, but the poorer merchants invested, and therefore risked, a higher percentage of their capital than the rich families. For this reason the idea of a union of the [[Arab tribes]] under one [[monotheism|monotheistic religion]] was developed by the poorer families of the Quraysh, for only such a union would eliminate the raids. Their speaker became Muhammad, who himself hailed from one of the [[Banu Hashim|less privileged Quraysh clans]].&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 135f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner maintains that the Koran portrayed [[Allah]] as "a rich, powerful and smart [[Capitalism|capitalist]]".&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 140ff.; for God as “the mighty heavenly capitalist” see ibid., 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Medina]], Muhammad acted not so much as a prophet and preacher but as a skillful organizer. He was successful not because people were eager to join a new religion but because they longed for a [[Sharia|law]] that would unite them.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part I, 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The Koran, Reisner continues, only guarantees the [[right to property]] and creates a “World Trade Company of Believers” (mirovaia torgovaia kompaniia veruiushchikh) under God's own leadership. Many elements in the Koran reflect a merchant's position: the prayers and rituals are not very complex and do not require “spiritual contortions”; the [[pilgrimage]] to Mecca ([[ḥajj]]) is linked to a trade fair; [[tithe]]s ([[zakāt]]) is restricted to a moderate level, and believers are exhorted not to squander their money; while [[riba|usury]] is forbidden, Muslims are encouraged to make moderate profits; and, of course, the Koran emphasizes the importance of oaths, correct measurements, and the faithful return of the deposit.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part II, 155-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner explains that mystical elements, which tended to supersede the clear class distinctions, were to enter Islam only much later, mainly stemming from the Persian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Reisner, “Koran”, part II, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

Reisner's interpretation turned out to be very influential among Soviet scholars of the late 1920s.

===Beliaev’s modification of trade capitalism theory===
Evgenii Beliaev (1895–1964) was the only professional trained in Oriental languages among all participants in the early Soviet discourse on Islam. In his contribution to the 1930 special issue of ''Ateist'' on the origins of Islam, Beliaev argued that Islam emerged from the merchant environment of Mecca.&lt;ref&gt;Evg. Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala v istorii proiskhozhdeniia islama”, in: Ateist no. 58 (November 1930), 48-60.&lt;/ref&gt; The pagan religion served the purpose of trade, and the authority of the gods in the [[kaaba]] grew with the wealth of the merchants. Islam emerged in the late 6th century as a movement of the less wealthy, “intermediary and lower Meccan bourgeoisie” against this “‘aristocracy’ of avaricious traders and pitiless usurers.”&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Reisner, however, Beliaev did not see anything progressive, liberating, or even revolutionary in this initial Islam: for instance, Islam did not stand up against slavery. Beliaev compared the image of God in the Koran to that of a despot and slave owner.&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 51, 55, 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Beliav, a similar struggle was taking place in Medina, where some clans became dependant upon others, and especially upon the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|clans]], whose wealth was based on “[[Usury|usury capital]]” (rostovshchicheskii kapital). The gradual dissolution of the ancient tribal and clan structures in Muslim Medina must not be ascribed to the religion of Islam but rather to the development of Meccan trade capital, and in general to the transition to private property in slaves, cattle, and other possessions. “With an eagerness and love for detail that is characteristic for the petty bourgeoisie, the boring, depressing and dull Suras of the Medinan period lay down the regulations for property and inheritance as well as buying and selling”.In Medina Muhammad changed the [[qibla|prayer direction]] from [[Jerusalem]] to Mecca; “praying to the Muslim God, they bow down before the only god that they respect, namely capital.” When the “medium wealthy” traders finally took over Mecca, they reached their goal: together with the rich “Quraysh of the Center” they found themselves at the helm of the “trade capitalist organization of the Hijaz” which eventually united the tribes of Arabia. The nomads, by contrast, did not play an active role in Beliaev's scenario; after Muhammad's death they easily committed [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] and had to be forced back to Islam by the first caliph, [[Abu Bakr]].&lt;ref&gt;Beliaev, “Rol’ mekkanskogo torgovogo kapitala”, 58ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ditiakin==
V. Ditiakin, an expert on the history of Marxism, took as his starting point the works of Marx and Engels instead of Islamic tradition, nor Western Oriental studies or even Reisner. Ditiakin conceded that Marx and Engels had only limited sources at their disposal and never devoted a special study to Islam; nevertheless he believed they came to important insights on this topic.

According to Ditiakin, Marx and Engels understood that [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] was characterized by two different environments, that of nomadic [[Bedouin]]s and that of settled urban traders. As the correspondences of the two thinkers show, the Bedouins could hardly be characterized as bearers of high culture, whereas the population of the southwestern Arabian peninsula was a “civilized” Oriental high culture. Obviously, Engels had access to publications on [[petroglyphs]] from [[Yemen]], which, in his mind, reflected “the ancient, national Arabic tradition of monotheism”. However, in the centuries immediately before Muhammad the old culture of Yemen was destroyed by incursions of the [[Ethiopia]]ns, and consequently also the Arabian trade route to the north via Mecca was in decay. This decline of trade in the period before Muhammad was, as Engels wrote to Marx in 1853, “one of the chief factors in the Muhammadan revolution”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 82, referring to Engels’ letter to Marx of June 6, 1853; see Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, Correspondence 1846-1895: A Selection with Commentary
and Notes (New York: International Publishers, without date [1934?]), 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote Engels again, “it seems that Mohammad’s religious revolution, like ''every'' religious movement, was ''formally a reaction'', an alleged return to the old, the simple”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83 (Engels’ letter to Marx, May 1853; cf. Marx and Engels, Correspondence 1846-1895, 64; emphasis in the original)&lt;/ref&gt; “the movement [of Muhammad] has seemed to me to have the character of a Bedouin reaction against the settled but degenerate fellahin of the towns, who at that time had also become very decadent in their religion, mingling a corrupt nature-cult with corrupt Judaism and Christianity.” The decline referred to by Engels was thus economic and religious.

According to Ditiakin, Engels’ statements led to the apparent contradiction that the uncivilized Bedouins, who were defeated and driven out of their country by foreign invaders, created an “[[Ideology|ideological system]]” that would ultimately rescue Arabia and soon rule over
a huge part of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ditiakin's mind, this apparent contradiction can only be solved by the following line of reasoning: The cradle of Islam was characterized by a coexistence of the nomadic lifestyle of the Bedouins and the formerly highly developed trade economy of the “[[fellah|urban fellahs]]”, which was however in decline, but still “potentially” stronger than the Bedouin culture. A series of “revolutionary blows” was necessary to dissolve the contradictions between the two, and to free the trade formation from its restrictions. These blows came in the form of foreign invasions, as Engels had
suggested in 1853: “The expulsion of the [[Habesha people|Abyssinia]]ns took place about forty years before Mohammed and was obviously the first act of the awakening Arabian national consciousness, which was also spurred by Persian invasions from the North, pushing forward almost to Mecca”.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 83 (Engels to Marx, June 6, 1853).&lt;/ref&gt;

For Ditiakin, Islam had a Bedouin character, and Bedouin lifestyle had a huge impact on the new religion. Due to the course of the Islamic expansion, however, the emergent religion of Islam was soon adapted to the foundations of urban economy. Accordingly, Islam eliminated the relics of the clan-based society and became the ideology of an urban society. The old nomadic and Bedouin cultural heritage of Islam, however, turned out to be strong enough to prevent Islam from becoming dominant in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ditiakin, “Marks i Engel’s”, 85f.&lt;/ref&gt; Ditiakin came to the conclusion that Muhammad's fight against the Quraysh of Mecca was “a revolution of the dying Bedouin culture against developing trade capital”—seemingly the exact contrary to Reisner's trade capitalism theory.

==Bedouin theory==
Another interpretation of the role of the Bedouins was brought forward by the Kazakh communist and historian Sandzhar D. Asfendiarov (1889–1938).&lt;ref&gt;For his biography see R.V. Suleimenov, “Vidnyi deiatel’ sotsialisticheskogo stroitel’stvav Srednei Azii i Kazakhstane, uchenyi-vostokoved”, in: Sandzhar Dzhafarovich Asfendiarov (Alma-Ata, 1990), 3-26; M. Makhmudov, “Partiino-gosudarstvennaia deiatel’nost’ S.D. Asfendiarova v Turkestane”, in: ibid., 44-60.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, during his brief directorate of the Moscow Oriental Institute, Asfendiarov published his first booklet on the “Reasons for the Emergence of Islam”.&lt;ref&gt;S.D. Asfendiarov, Materialy k izucheniiu istorii vostoka. Chast’ pervaia: Prichiny vozniknoveniia islama (Samarkand, 1928).&lt;/ref&gt;

Asfendiarov regarded Islam as the product not of the merchants of Mecca, as Reisner did, but of the Arab nomads. To him, the Islamic expansion was a huge emigration wave of about one million nomads from the [[Hijaz]] and [[Najd]] regions of Arabia to the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Asfendiarov maintained that Islam emerged as the last huge expansion of Semite tribes from Arabia. However, Asfendiarov insisted that this expansion resulted from changes in the nomadic economy, not from climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 47-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to him, the Arabs were beyond the formation of “primitive patriarchal nomadism”; rather, they possessed a “developed”, modified cattle breeding economy. By the 7th century, Arabia suffered from a scarcity in land for cattle breeding. The Byzantine and Persian empires in the North, and the Persian and Ethiopian interventions in Yemen, resulted in an isolation of Central Arabia, as well as in a heightened competition for the available pastures.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 15, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this scarcity and competition, Arab tribes now occupied the oases and towns of the Hijaz, like Mecca and Medina, which had hitherto been inhabited mainly by Jews and other settled populations. The Arabic tribes that conquered these settlements took over the agricultural and merchant activities that had been in place.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 22ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Bedouin tribes, like the Quraysh, therefore turned into trading tribes. Due to the increased mutual raiding and warfare among cattle-breeders, more and more Arab nomads lost their livestock, settled around these settlements as pauperized and dependant clans, and took on agricultural work to make a living.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 17, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

For all of these reasons, the tribal economy of 7th-century Arabia constituted more than just a primitive patriarchal society, for the majority of transhumant cattle-breeders was supplemented by Arab traders and Arab agriculturalists (or “semi-agriculturalists”, as Asfendiarov had it,&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; for they still had connections to the nomadic way of life). Taken together, these three social groups still made up one single economic formation, one that was characterized by a certain amount of economic specialization with all ensuing social contradictions, especially a marked distinction between rich and poor. What they all had in common was their tribal organization, which did not evolve into a community- or neighborhood-based social organization. The tribal organization, according to Asfendiarov, was not simply a “residue” (perezhitok) of the past that was doomed to vanish, but rather a very functional element necessary for survival in all three economic environments.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 29f.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded that the Orient was characterized not by a historical sequence of primitive-patriarchal, feudal, and capitalist society, as in the West, but by one tribal formation that combined elements from all three formations. According to Asfendiarov, this tribal formation was retained at least until the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 5ff., 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam, in Asfendiarov's mind, was nothing but the event that triggered off the social expansion of the Arab tribes, uniting the tribes to break the isolation of Arabia. It was an “unconscious impulse”, an “almost secondary reason” for the movement of the tribes. Islam should therefore be understood as an economic movement of the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 28, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Asfendiarov strongly criticized Reisner's view that Islam embodied the interests of the Meccan traders.&lt;ref&gt;Asfendiarov, Materialy, 20, 24, 39-43, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peasant theory==
A completely new interpretation of the rise of Islam was brought
forward by the economist Mikhail L. Tomara. Tomara's article in the Ateist special issue of 1930, entitled “The
Origin of Islam and Its Class Basis”,&lt;ref&gt;M. Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama i ego klassovoe osnovanie”, in: Ateist, no. 58
(November 1930), 19-47.&lt;/ref&gt; points at the role of peasants
and agriculture in 7th-century Arabia. Tomara listed up a vast
number of witnesses, taken partly from al-Ṭabarī (d. 923), but
mostly from European travellers like Niebuhr, Burton and Palgrave,
and especially from Aloys Sprenger's ''Das Leben und Werk des Mohammed''
(1861–1865), showing that Arabia's agricultural and horticultural
population vastly exceeded its Bedouin population, not to speak of
the merchants.

In Tomara's mind, agriculture was mainly taken up
by impoverished Bedouins; under the general climate change in
Arabia, Bedouins whose pastures dried up would either emigrate or, when the emigration was blocked as was the case before Islam,
dig wells and settle down to pursue agriculture with the help of
artificial irrigation. The continuous transformation of pasture land
into fields led to an intensified struggle between the Bedouins and
the peasant population. Tomara assumed that the agriculturalists
consisted mainly of clients (''mawālī'', sing. ''mawla'') of powerful
clans, manumitted slaves and other dislocated people. Poor agriculturalists
would become dependent on usurers and often lose their
house, land, and cattle, thus being forced to work as hired pastors
(Russ. ''batraki'') for rich neighbors. Tomara thus distinguished three
“classes”: nomads, well-to-do peasants, and impoverished peasants
who lived a semi-transhumant or even transhumant life (obviously,
while herding the Bedouins’ cattle).&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 19-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, he provided no source for his assumption that impoverished peasants sold their labor as pastors.

Tomara further maintained that trade was only slightly developed
in 7th-century Arabia, and therefore Islam cannot be credited to it:
“Islam was born in the trade city of Mecca, but only as an expression
of the dissatisfaction of the poor strata of the city; and it turned
out to be unsuccessful there. Trade capital, as a fierce opponent of
Islam, defeated Islam and drove it out of Mecca”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 47; cf. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently,
Islam found a solid class basis in Medina, an exclusively agricultural
town. The Koran's endorsement of charity, so Tomara, the use of
alms to support the poor, to manumit slaves, and to relieve debtors
from their financial burdens, shows clearly that Islam emerged as
the religion of the urban poor. The poor emigrants (muhājirūn) from
Mecca joined the urban poor of Medina and broke the power of
the rich Medinan landowners who had opposed Muhammad at
several occasions. As indicated in Koran 59:7, Muhammad allotted
agricultural lands in and around Medina to his poor supporters as
well as to people who flocked to him from other agricultural communities
in Arabia. The increasing need to reward peasant supporters
led to the expulsion, and later annihilation, of the Jewish clans of Medina, for they held the best arable land in and around the oasis.
By contrast, Muhammad did not invest much energy into the fight
against the Quraysh, for there was no peasant land to gain from
dry Mecca; the few famous battles like Badr (in 624) were mere
skirmishes, and the later battle at Uhud and the Meccan siege of
Medina show that Muhammad was clearly on the defensive against
his hometown. Tomara found support for his “peasant theory” in
the Koran; its ban of interest, in his mind, expressed the interests
of agriculturalists who suffered from exploitation by usurers. Also,
he suggested that the Koranic inheritance laws reflect the ongoing
splitting-up of agricultural land in Medina.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 29ff., 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nomads, by contrast, did not play an active role in Tomara's
scenario; they were unreliable as warriors,75 and they accepted Islam
only superficially. Also, “if Islam was the religion of the nomadic
cattle-breeders, then Paradise would have been depicted [in the
Koran] as infinite steppes of high grass, similar to the way how
American Indians imagined their reward in the Hereafter as hunting
grounds in prairies with plenty of bisons and other wild animals.”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, in the War of Apostasy (ridda) after Muhammad's death
the Bedouin tribes tried to reclaim the pasture lands they had lost
to the poor Medinans and to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; But this rebellion was
crushed by Abū Bakr, and the nomads found themselves forced to
emigrate. As both the Sassanid and the Byzantine empire were now
in political and economical disarray, the Bedouins found an easy
outlet by emigration to Persia, Syria, and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt; In result, and
somewhat surprisingly, the Islamic expansion under the first caliphs
was mainly undertaken by nomads driven out of their territories by
Islam itself. Thus, in its beginnings Islam was the ideology of the
peasants, and only later, under the Abbasids after 750, did Islam
become “the ideology of trade capital in the form of Mu’tazilism, and the ideology of the feudal classes of Persia in the form of
Shi’ism.”&lt;ref&gt;Tomara, “Proiskhozhdenie islama”, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomara's interpretation thus does not ignore the role of nomadic
Bedouins and urban traders, and even assigns them meaningful roles
in the emergence and spread of Islam. Their functions, however,
were mainly defined in the negative. Because Tomara
pointed out the crucial role of the poor agriculturalists in and around
the towns, his concept would be regarded by his opponents as a
mere “peasant theory”.

==Klimovich==
Liutsian I. Klimovich (1907–1989), in his first major scholarly article, entitled “On the Origin of
Islam”,&lt;ref&gt;published 1927 in Ateist&lt;/ref&gt; made references to a
considerable number of Western Orientalists (like Dozy, Nöldeke,
Muir, Weil, von Kremer, Lammens, and Sprenger) and largely followed Mikhail Reisner's theory that Islam emerged from Meccan trade
capitalism. The opposition of the poor merchant families was directed
against the rich clans and their pagan cult at the kaaba. This opposition
manifested itself first in the movement of the Arab Hanif
monotheists which was later to develop into Islam. Klimovich maintained
that this movement was originally atheist, progressive and
revolutionary in character; when Muhammad became its figurehead
the movement took on religious traits, yet without losing its progressive
character right away.&lt;ref&gt;L. Klimovich, “K voprosu o proiskhozhdenii islama”, in: Ateist, No. 18, April 1927,
52-63, here: 55ff.&lt;/ref&gt; After the hijra to Medina Muhammad
turned into a dexterous politician for whom Islam was nothing but
a means to gain power. Similarly, the Arab tribes that joined the
movement were only interested in booty, not in religion. After a
series of battles the reactionary merchants of Mecca decided to
embrace the new religion, because they understood that Islam would
provide them with a new instrument for ruling over the Arab tribes.
It is at the hands of these rich merchant families, according to
Klimovich, that Islam finally turned from a revolutionary movement
into an instrument for oppression and spiritual enslavement of the
Muslim masses.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “K voprosu o proiskhozhdenii islama”, 61ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that with his insistence on the “progressive” character of early Islam Klimovich intended to develop a new and specific strategy for anti-Islamic propaganda, one that would pull the carpet from underneath the believers’ feet.
After graduating in 1929 Klimovich returned to his hometown
Kazan, where he was a member of the local branch of the League
of the Militant Godless (Soiuz Voinstvuiushchikh Bezbozhnikov, SVB).&lt;ref&gt;On the SVB see the study of Daniel Peris, Storming the Heavens: The Soviet League of
the Militant Godless (Ithaca; London, 1998), which, however, does not take into consideration
atheist propaganda work among the Muslim populations of the Soviet Union.&lt;/ref&gt;
That same year he published his first two books. In Sotsialisticheskoe
stroitel’stvo na vostoke i religiia,&lt;ref&gt;“The Socialist Construction in the
East and Religion”, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Klimovich maintained that the Muslim
periphery of the Soviet Union was witnessing an ongoing revival of
Islam. Under the conditions of the New Economic Policy, reformist
mullahs tried to convince the Muslim masses that Islam was perfectly compatible with socialism.

Klimovich warned that this was a deception,
for socialism was based on Marxism, [[materialism]], and the
[[Hegel|dialectical method]], and diametrically opposed to religion and its
[[idealism]]. Atheist propagandists, however, were often helpless in their
discussions with the believers. What Klimovich considered necessary,
therefore, was basic information on Islam for the anti-religious
activist. This was the purpose of his second book of 1929, Soderzhanie
korana (“The Contents of the Koran”).&lt;ref&gt;Liutsian Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana. S predisloviem i pod redaktsiei prof. V. Ditiakina
(Moscow: Ateist, 1929); cf. the preface written by the editor Ditiakin, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was
basically a compilation of quotations from the Koran. Klimovich
explained the book's structure, the Koranic image of God, as well
as its narratives on the creation of the world, Judgment Day, Paradise,
and Hell. Above all, he emphasized internal contradictions in the
Koranic message and the scientific inaccurateness and simplicity
of the scripture.

Klimovich's Koran book still followed Mikhail Reisner's view that
Islam emerged from Meccan merchant capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana, 3 (Ditiakin), 51 (Klimovich). In his preface to Klimovich’s
book, Ditiakin remarked that this view was at least disputed. Ditiakin also openly
criticized Klimovich for certain shortcomings, and maintained that Klimovich’s book was
only a “first attempt” (5).&lt;/ref&gt; The Koran,
according to Klimovich, was an “Arabic law book” which demanded
discipline in the interest of the merchant corporation, whose codex
it represents. Besides trade, a second “way” demanded in the holy
book of Islam is endurance and obedience to God, the Prophet and
his family, as well as to the “people in power”, which, in Klimovich's
mind, clearly reflected the reactionary turn of Islam. The third “way”
of Islam is jihād, the call to fight and kill the unbelievers. As martyrs
would directly go to heaven, Klimovich regarded jihād as “a lottery
in which one cannot lose”.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, Soderzhanie korana, 57, 58, 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Existence of Muhammad===
In November 1930 Klimovich came up with what he probably believed to be a fatal blow to Islam and at the same time a revolution within Islamic studies. That month he gave a lecture in the Communist Academy (probably in Kazan), asking the provocative question, “Did Muhammad Exist?”&lt;ref&gt;Liutsian Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed? Diskussiia v Kommunisticheskoi akademii v antireligioznoi sektsii instituta filosofii 12/XI 1930g. po dokladu L.I. Klimovicha”,
in: Voinstvuiushchii ateizm, No. 2-3, (1931), 189-218.&lt;/ref&gt; This lecture amounted to a wholesale refutation of Islamic historiography on the early Muslim community. According to Klimovich, no contemporary sources on Muhammad's life have come down to us; the earliest known reports and biographies of the prophet, like that of Ibn Isḥāq/Ibn Hishām, were written by Muslim authors of the mid-8th and 9th centuries. By that time, however, the Muslim scholars themselves had no reliable information on Muhammad's life at their disposal; all they had was the Koran, and therefore their biographies and the ḥadīth material is nothing but a late illustration and commentary on the Koran.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 197. Klimovich does not refer to Western authors who questioned the authenticity of ḥadīth.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, by that time the language of the Koran itself was so incomprehensible even to Arabs that the new additional
sources were necessary to make sense of it at all.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 200 (with reference to a statement by
Vasilii Bartol’d).&lt;/ref&gt; In result, the time gap between Muhammad's alleged lifetime and the first written
sources was so huge that we cannot suppose that any of the information given in these sources is authentic. According to Klimovich,
also references to Muhammad in Christian sources were anything
but convincing.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 200f.&lt;/ref&gt; Klimovich concluded that nothing is known for
sure about the historical Muhammad, and that it is even likely that
he never existed. Quite consequently, Klimovich assumed that the
Koran was not Muhammad's work but the product of a whole
group of authors.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad was created by later historians as
a myth, designed to explain the emergence of the Islamic community
out of the Hanif movement. The prophet was an invention to cover
up early Islam's character as a social protest movement.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Sushchestvoval li Mokhammed?”, 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

===During the Stalinist Era===
During the Stalinist Era and the domination of Feudalism theory, Klimovich understood he had to withdraw from his view that Islam had initially been a progressive social protest movement. The starting point could no longer be the Koran, the Arabic tradition, or the critique of “bourgeois” Orientalism; instead, one had to start with the works of Marx and Engels. In a lecture held at the KUTV in May 1933,&lt;ref&gt;Published later in Revoliutsionnyi Vostok as “Marx and Engels on Islam and the Problem of Its Origin in Soviet Islamic Studies”&lt;/ref&gt; 120 Klimovich basically listed up all quotes by Engels on Islam which Ditiakin had already published in 1927, without, however, giving any credit to Ditiakin. As we have seen, Engels remarked that religion was a “fantastic” reflection on life, that Islam was the “reaction of the Bedouins” as well as the “first act of the awakening Arabian national consciousness”, a “return to the old”. Taking these quotes together, Klimovich concluded that Islam had to be classified as reactionary.

Klimovich now contended that Islam resulted from a process of “feudalization” and centralization of the Arabic tribes, which was reflected in the centralization of the religious cults in the Kaaba. Put in these terms, Islam emerged as the “ideology of feudal lords (Russ. feodalov)”, representing exploitation and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 62f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feudalism theory==
This theory remained dominant throughout the Stalinist era and afterward because it confirmed the official Soviet doctrine. The other theories were rejected as "Revisionist" and "Trotskyist"
Already in previous years Soviet anti-religious activists in the Muslim peripheries attacked Muslim landowners alongside mullahs, claiming that Islam supported feudal exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;To give an example, anti-religious propaganda in Azerbeijan denounced Islam as “the
ideology of militant trade capitalism” and “a pillar of feudalism” as early as 1928 (''Ba berowski,
Der Feind ist überall'', 559).&lt;/ref&gt; In
the early 1930s, however, Islam itself started to be regarded as a feudal product. At the same time, the tone of the debates became
even more aggressive. One of the earliest contributions to this develop
ment was a review essay written by one Kh. Naumov in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;Kh. Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia (K voprosu o
proiskhozhdenii islama)”, in: Revoliutsionnyi Vostok, No. 3-4 (15-16), 1932, 325-339.&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in ''Revoliutsionnyi Vostok''.

Naumov's review essay attacked
Evgenii Beliaev, who had recently published a textbook with Russian
translations of Western European Orientalists.&lt;ref&gt;Evg. Beliaev (ed.), Proiskhozhdenie islama: Khrestomatiia, part I (Moscow; Leningrad,
1931).&lt;/ref&gt; Naumov attacked Beliaev harshly not only for “popularizing” the
achievements of bourgeois Orientalists but also for presenting the
three economic environments distinctly, and for adding them up
“mechanically”. Instead of being separated, he insisted, “the three
systems were distinct parts of a unified economy of Arabia in those
days, with the trade regions having a dominant role on the basis
of their feudal relations”.&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 327f.&lt;/ref&gt; Naumov
nowhere explained this relationship between trade and feudalism,
nor did he provide any sources.

Naumov quoted Engels to the effect that “all religion (…) is
nothing but the fantastic reflection in men’s minds of those external
forces which control their daily live”.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Engels, Herr Eugen Dühring’s Revolution in Science (Anti-Dühring), (New
York: International Publishers, 1939), 344.&lt;/ref&gt; This quote alone sufficed
him to maintain that “the Koran is the distorted fantastic expression
of the reality of those times”. Consequently, it is wrong to regard
the Koran as a source for early Islam. Naumov went on to explain
that it is also inacceptable to make a distinction between Muslims
and non-Muslims, as Beliaev had done when he mentioned that the
Muslims of Medina were attacking the caravans of pagan Mecca.
Making a distinction between Muslims and non-Muslims, so Naumov,
means to take over the position of “missionaries” who sort out the
non-believers (as we will see, the accusation that Orientalists become
missionaries, that scholarship serves religion, was becoming a convenient
and widespread instrument of defamation in the 1930s).
Naumov also attacked many other Marxist Orientalists, including
Liutsian Klimovich for his view that Islam was a “social revolution”
of the “progressive elements of Arabic trade capital”.&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naumov's leveling of Muslims and non-Muslims, his disregard for
religion as a special factor, can probably best be characterized as an
ultra-leftist position. In general, however, his rejection of the importance
of religion and personalities and his deterministic emphasis
on materialism can still be linked to the school of M.N. Pokrovskii.

“The centralization of the
monetary capital in some Arabian cities, above all in Mecca, the
struggle against the ‘colonizers’ [i.e., the Ethiopians and the Persians],
the dissolution of natural (economic) relations, and the process of
class warfare in general pushed the Arabs with iron inevitability
towards the creation of an Arabic state.”&lt;ref&gt;Naumov, “Protiv populiarizatsii burzhuaznogo islamovedeniia”, 329.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klimovich embraced the Feudalism theory wholeheartedly and attacked Navshirvanov&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 64 (Grimme), 66 (Bartol’d, Navshirvanovs),
69 (Müller). Also attacked is P.K. Zhuze, “Iz istorii kommunisticheskogo dvizheniia v
islame”, in: Nauchnoe obozrenie no. 1 (1923), 26-34 (not available to me).&lt;/ref&gt; and Tomara &lt;ref&gt;Klimovich refers specifically to Tomara’s article “Islam i kommunizm”, published by
Ditiakin in his volume of articles entitled Islam (Moscow, 1931), 189-218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Klimovich attacked the “trade capitalism theory” of Reisner with
similar harshness; to be sure, Reisner had died some years before,
but as seen above, his theory had been taken up and modified by
Evgenii Beliaev and others.&lt;ref&gt;Klimovich, “Marks i Engel’s ob islame”, 77. Klimovich also attacked Nikolai Smirnov’s
(1886-1983) Musul’manskoe sektantstvo (Moscow, 1930).&lt;/ref&gt;

The change in the general political atmosphere of the country and
in Islamic studies in particular prompted many authors to readjust
their positions. This produced a weak but unified Soviet theory on
Islam that would henceforth be regarded as dogma. In the following years it became impossible to describe Islam in
any meaningful manner. The surviving participants in the Soviet
discourse on Islam had to subscribe to the dogma that linked Islam
to feudalism. At the same time it was carefully avoided to ascribe
any content to the term “feudal”, or to explain its relationship with
the “trade capitalists”.&lt;ref&gt;Die Welt des Islams, Volume 49, Number 1, 2009 , pp. 1-48(48)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants.svg|thumb|{{legend|#50C878|State parties to the Stockholm Convention as of 2017}}]]

'''Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants''' is an international [[environmental law|environmental]] [[treaty]], signed in 2001 and effective from May 2004, that aims to eliminate or restrict the production and use of [[persistent organic pollutant]]s (POPs).

== History ==
In 1995, the Governing Council of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) called for global action to be taken on POPs, which it defined as “chemical substances that persist in the environment, [[Bioaccumulation|bio-accumulate]] through the [[food web]], and pose a risk of causing adverse effects to human health and the environment”.

Following this, the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS) and the [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] (IPCS) prepared an assessment of the 12 worst offenders, known as the ''dirty dozen''.

The INC met five times between June 1998 and December 2000 to elaborate the convention, and delegates adopted the Stockholm Convention on POPs at the Conference of the Plenipotentiaries convened from 22–23 May 2001 in Stockholm, Sweden.

The negotiations for the Convention were completed on 23 May 2001 in [[Stockholm]]. The convention entered into force on 17 May 2004 with [[ratification]] by an initial 128 parties and 151 signatories. Co-signatories agree to outlaw nine of the dirty dozen chemicals, limit the use of [[DDT]] to [[malaria]] control, and curtail inadvertent production of dioxins and [[furan]]s.

Parties to the convention have agreed to a process by which persistent toxic compounds can be reviewed and added to the convention, if they meet certain criteria for persistence and transboundary threat. The first set of new chemicals to be added to the Convention were agreed at a conference in [[Geneva]] on 8 May 2009.

As of June 2018, there are 182 parties to the Convention, (181 states and the [[European Union]]).&lt;ref name="UNTC" /&gt; Notable non-ratifying states include the United States, Israel, Malaysia, and Italy.

The Stockholm Convention was adopted to [[European Union|EU]] legislation in REGULATION (EC) No 850/2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:158:0007:0049:EN:PDF|title=REGULATION (EC) No 850/2004 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC|author=|date=|website=europa.eu|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of provisions==
Key elements of the Convention include the requirement that developed countries provide new and additional financial resources and measures to eliminate production and use of intentionally produced POPs, eliminate unintentionally produced POPs where feasible, and manage and dispose of POPs wastes in an environmentally sound manner. Precaution is exercised throughout the Stockholm Convention, with specific references in the preamble, the objective, and the provision on identifying new POPs.

==Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee==
When adopting the Convention, provision was made for a procedure to identify additional POPs and the criteria to be considered in doing so. At the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP1), held in Punta del Este, Uruguay from 2–6 May 2005, the POPRC was established to consider additional candidates nominated for listing under the Convention.

The Committee is composed of 31 experts nominated by parties from the five United Nations regional groups and reviews nominated chemicals in three stages. The Committee first determines whether the substance fulfills POP screening criteria detailed in Annex D of the Convention, relating to its persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and toxicity. If a substance is deemed to fulfill these requirements, the Committee then drafts a risk profile according to Annex E to evaluate whether the substance is likely, as a result of its LRET, to lead to significant adverse human health and/or environmental effects and therefore warrants global action. Finally, if the POPRC finds that global action is warranted, it develops a risk management evaluation, according to Annex F, reflecting socioeconomic considerations associated with possible control measures. Based on this, the POPRC decides to recommend that the COP list the substance under one or more of the annexes to the Convention. The POPRC has met annually in Geneva, Switzerland since its establishment. 
	
The seventh meeting of the Persistent Organic Pollutants Review Committee (POPRC-7) of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) took place from 10–14 October 2011 in Geneva, Switzerland. POPRC-8 was held from 15–19 October 2012 in Geneva, POPRC-9 to POPRC-13 were held in Rome.

== Listed substances ==
There were initially twelve distinct chemicals listed in three categories. Two chemicals, hexachlorobenzene and polychlorinated biphenyls, were listed in both categories A and C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Chemicals newly proposed for inclusion in Annexes A,B,C==
POPRC-7 considered three proposals for listing in Annexes A, B and/or C of the Convention: [[Polychlorinated naphthalene|chlorinated naphthalenes]] (CNs), [[hexachlorobutadiene]] (HCBD) and [[pentachlorophenol]] (PCP), its salts and esters. The proposal is the first stage of the POPRC's work in assessing a substance, and requires the POPRC to assess whether the proposed chemical satisfies the criteria in Annex D of the Convention. The criteria for forwarding a proposed chemical to the risk profile preparation stage are persistence, bioaccumulation, potential for long-range environmental transport (LRET), and adverse effects.

POPRC-8 proposed [[hexabromocyclododecane]] for listing in Annex A, with specific exemptions for production and use in expanded polystyrene and extruded polystyrene in buildings. This proposal was agreed at the sixth Conference of Parties on 28 April-10 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Convention/POPsReviewCommittee/LatestMeeting/POPRC8/POPRC8Followup/HBCDRecommendation/tabid/2912/Default.aspx|title=HBCD Recommendation|first=Stockholm|last=Convention|date=|website=chm.pops.int|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/CN/2013/CN.934.2013-Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

POPRC-9 proposed [[Polychlorinated naphthalene|di-,tri-,tetra-,penta-,hexa-, hepta- and octa-chlorinated napthalenes]], and hexachlorobutadiene for listing in Annexes A and C. It also set up further work on pentachlorophenol, its salts and esters, and decabromodiphenyl ether, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl chloride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chm.pops.int/Convention/POPsReviewCommittee/LatestMeeting/POPRC9/POPRC9Documents/tabid/3281/Default.aspx|title=Stockholm Convention &gt; The Convention &gt; POPs Review Committee &gt; Meetings &gt; POPRC 9 &gt; Documents|first=Stockholm|last=Convention|date=|website=chm.pops.int|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
Although some critics have alleged that the treaty is responsible for the continuing death toll from malaria, in reality the treaty specifically permits the public health use of [[DDT]] for the control of [[mosquito]]es (the malaria [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Curtis, C.

As long as there are specific measures taken, such as use of DDT indoors, then the limited amount of DDT can be used in a regulated fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/iris/handle/10665/69945|title=The use of DDT in malaria vector control : WHO position statement|last=World Health Organization. Global Malaria Programme|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=Geneva: World Health Organization|access-date=November 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a developing country perspective, a lack of data and information about the sources, releases, and environmental levels of POPs hampers negotiations on specific compounds, and indicates a strong need for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Bouwman, H. | year = 2004 | title = South Africa and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants | journal = S.

Another controversy would be certain POPs (which are continually active, specifically in the Arctic Biota) that were mentioned in the Stockholm Convention, but were not part of the Dirty Dozen such as Perfluorooctone sulfonates (PFOs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Godduhn|first=Anna|last2=Duffy|first2=Lawrence K.|date=August 2003|title=Multi-generation health risks of persistent organic pollution in the far north: use of the precautionary approach in the Stockholm Convention|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1462-9011(03)00061-3|journal=Environmental Science and Policy|volume=6|issue=4|pages=341–353}}&lt;/ref&gt; PFOs have many general uses such as stain repellents but have many properties which can make it a dangerous due to the fact that PFOs can be highly resistant to environmental breakdown. PFOs can be toxic in terms of increased offspring death, decrease in body weight, and the disruption of neurological systems. What makes this compound controversial is the economic and political impact it can have among various countries and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Thanh Wang, Yawei Wang, Chunyang Liao, Yaqi Cai and Guibin Jiang.

:''This article is about the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. For the organisation which contains the Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships, see [[Tavistock Institute of Medical Psychology]], and for the current National Health arm see [[Tavistock Clinic]]''

The '''Tavistock Institute of Human Relations''' or '''TIHR''' is a British not-for-profit organisation which applies social science to contemporary issues and problems. It was initiated in 1946, when it developed from the [[Tavistock Clinic]], and was formally established as a separate entity in September 1947. The journal [[Human Relations (journal)|''Human Relations'']] is published on behalf of the Tavistock Institute by [[SAGE Publications|Sage Publications]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tavinstitute.org/humanrelations/index.html|title=Human Relations|website=www.tavinstitute.org|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is located in Tabernacle Street in [[Islington]], London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tavinstitute.org/|title=The Tavistock Institute|last=|first=|date=|website=The Tavistock Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Tavistock==
The early history of the Tavistock Institute overlaps with that of the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust#Early history|Tavistock Clinic]] because many of the staff from the Clinic worked on new, large-scale projects during [[World War II]], and it was as a result of this work that the Institute was created.

During the war, staff from the [[Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust|Tavistock Clinic]] played key roles in British Army psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Institute can be found in the publication ''[http://www.moderntimesworkplace.com/archives/ericsess/ericsess.html The Social Engagement of Social Science: A Tavistock Anthology]'' published by the [[University of Pennsylvania]] Press in three volumes between 1990 and 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Working with colleagues in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] and the [[British Army during the Second World War|British Army]], they were responsible for innovations such as [[War Office Selection Boards|War Office Selection Boards (WOSBs)]] and [[Civil Resettlement Units|Civil Resettlement Units (CRUs)]], and also worked on psychological warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ky3gSOreBOIC&amp;pg=PA31|title=The British Army and the People's War, 1939-1945|last=Crang|first=Jeremy A.|date=2000-11-18|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=9780719047411|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BCtUCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA116e|title=Ruling Minds: Psychology in the British Empire|last=Linstrum|first=Erik|date=2016-01-04|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=9780674088665|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Square Pegs and Round Holes: Aptitude Testing in the Barracks and Beyond}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mugpAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Tavistock+CRUs+resettlement&amp;dq=Tavistock+CRUs+resettlement&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiK87mgpvzVAhUNLVAKHcOJCyUQ6AEIRjAG|title=Tools for transformation: a personal study|last=Curle|first=Adam|date=1990|publisher=Hawthorn Press|isbn=9781869890216|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kgwe155uywYC|title=The Pursuit of the Nazi Mind: Hitler, Hess, and the Analysts|last=Pick|first=Daniel|date=2012-06-14|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191641046|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group that formed around the WOSBs and CRUs were fascinated by this work with groups and organisations, and sought to continue research in this field after the war. Various influential figures had visited the WOSBs during the war, so there was scope for consultancy work, but the Clinic staff also planned to become a part of the [[National Health Service]] when it was established, and they had been warned that such consultancy and research would not be possible under the auspices of the NHS.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g__OBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Fifty Years of the Tavistock Clinic (Psychology Revivals)|last=Dicks|first=H. V.|date=2014-10-14|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317587897|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations was created in 1947 to carry out organisational research when the Clinic was incorporated into the NHS.&lt;ref name="mtwp"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moderntimesworkplace.com/archives/ericsess/tavis1/tavis1.html|title=The Social Engagement of Social Science|last=Trist|first=Eric|last2=Murray|first2=Hugh|date=1990|website=www.moderntimesworkplace.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rockefeller Foundation]] awarded a significant grant that facilitated the creation of the TIHR.

In the early years of the TIHR, income was derived from research grants, contract work, and fees for courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N5jZAAAAMAAJ|title=A History of Group Study and Psychodynamic Organizations|last=Fraher|first=Amy Louise|date=2004|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=9781853437045|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1950s and 1960s, the TIHR carried out a number of signature projects in collaboration with major manufacturing companies including [[Unilever]], the Ahmedabad Manufacturing and Calico Printing Co., [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]], [[Bayer]], and Glacier Metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XBWLfba4adMC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Tavistock+unilever&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Tavistock%20unilever&amp;f=false|title=Renewing Unilever : Transformation and Tradition: Transformation and Tradition|last=Jones|first=Geoffrey|date=2005-07-01|publisher=Oxford University Press, UK|isbn=9780191556388|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bifM3CY-6fgC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Centre+for+Applied+Social+Research+(CASR),+tavistock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Centre%20for%20Applied%20Social%20Research%20(CASR),%20tavistock&amp;f=false|title=Group Psychology and Political Theory|last=Alford|first=C.

Particular focusses included management, women in the workplace, and the adoption (or rejection) of new technologies. Projects on the interaction between people and technology later became known as the [[Sociotechnical system|sociotechnical approach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baxter|first=Gordon|last2=Sommerville|first2=Ian|date=2011-01-01|title=Socio-technical systems: From design methods to systems engineering|url=https://academic.oup.com/iwc/article/23/1/4/693091/Socio-technical-systems-From-design-methods-to|journal=Interacting with Computers|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|pages=4–17|doi=10.1016/j.intcom.2010.07.003|issn=0953-5438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s also saw the TIHR conducting consumer research and exploring attitudes to things as varied as [[Bovril]], [[fish finger]]s, coffee and hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tihr-archive.tavinstitute.org/social-science-action-reports-tavistock-archive/|title=Social Science in Action: reports from Tavistock Institute Archive - TIHR Archive Project|date=2016-09-01|work=TIHR Archive Project|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s and 1970s, the TIHR had a notable focus on public health organisations such as hospitals. Studies examined a range of aspects of healthcare, from ward management and operating theatres to the organisation of cleaning staff.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite archive |first= |last= |item = |item-url = http://archives.wellcomelibrary.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=%28RefNo==%27SATIH%27%29 |type = |item-id = SA/TIH |date = |page= |pages= |fonds = |series = |file = |box= |collection = Tavistock Institute of Human Relations Archives |collection-url = |repository = |institution = Wellcome Library |location = London |oclc= |accession= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, the TIHR conducted work for the European Commission and British government bodies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Research units ===
In the TIHR's early years, there were four main units: Programme Groups A and B within a Committee on Human Resources; Organisation and Social Change and Operations Research Unit; and a Committee on Family and Community Psychiatry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The Human Resources Centre (HRC) and the Centre for Applied Social Research (CASR)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=57oo43hXpiUC&amp;pg=PT143&amp;dq=Centre+for+Applied+Social+Research+(CASR),+tavistock&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Centre%20for%20Applied%20Social%20Research%20(CASR),%20tavistock&amp;f=false|title=Governing the Present: Administering Economic, Social and Personal Life|last=Rose|first=Nikolas|last2=Miller|first2=Peter|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=0745654924|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; were established in the 1950s, and in 1963 the Institute of Operational Research (IOR) was established in conjunction with the British Operational Research Society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mrc-catalogue.warwick.ac.uk/records/IOR|title=Institute for Operational Research|website=mrc-catalogue.warwick.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre for Organisational and Operational Research (COOR) was created from a merger of the HRC and the IOR in 1979.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Self Help Alliance project begun in the 1980s led to further work in evaluation and the creation of a dedicated unit, the Evaluation Development Review Unit (EDRU) in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.wellcomelibrary.org/2016/09/social-science-in-action-reports-from-tavistock-institute-archive/|title=Social science in action: reports from Tavistock Institute of Human Relations (TIHR) Archive|work=Wellcome Library|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Key figures ===
The Institute was founded by a group of key figures from the [[Tavistock Clinic]] and British Army psychiatry including [[Elliott Jaques]], [[Henry Dicks]], Leonard Browne, Ronald Hargreaves, [[John Rawlings Rees]], [[Mary Luff]] and [[Wilfred Bion]], with [[A.T.M. Wilson|Tommy Wilson]] as chairman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other well-known people that joined the group shortly after were [[Isabel Menzies Lyth]], [[J. D. Sutherland]], [[John Bowlby]], [[Eric Trist]], and [[Fred Emery]]. Although he died before the TIHR was formally established, [[Kurt Lewin]] was an important influence on the work of the Tavistock: he was a notable influence on Trist, and contributed an article to the first issue of ''[[Human Relations (journal)|Human Relations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OTH_CQAAQBAJ|title=Behavior, Technology, and Organizational Development: Eric Trist and the Tavistock Institute|last=Trahair|first=Richard|date=2015-06-01|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412855495|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/toc/huma/1/1|title=Human Relations - Volume 1, Number 1, Jun 01, 1947|website=journals.sagepub.com|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the members of the Tavistock Institute went on to play major roles in psychology. [[John Rawlings Rees]] became first president of the [[World Federation for Mental Health]].&lt;ref name="mtwp" /&gt; Jock Sutherland became director of the new post-war Tavistock Clinic, when it was incorporated into the newly established British [[National Health Service]] in 1946. Ronald Hargreaves became deputy director of the [[World Health Organization]]. Tommy Wilson became chairman of the Tavistock Institute.&lt;ref name="mtwp" /&gt; One of the most influential figures to emerge from the Institute was the psychoanalyst [[Isabel Menzies Lyth]]. Her seminal paper 'A case study in the functioning of social systems as a defence against anxiety' (1959) inspired a whole branch of organisational theory emphasizing unconscious forces that shape organizational life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/20/1|title=Isabel Menzies Lyth|last=Dartington|first=Tim|date=2008-02-20|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; A.K. Rice did considerable work on problems of management, increasing productivity at one factory by 300%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ofek-groups.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=54|title=Albert Kenneth (Ken) Rice 1908-1969|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ofek-groups.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Miller became director of the ''Group Relation Program'' in 1969, and in this function he later developed the design of the [[Nazareth-Conferences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fed with Tears – Poisoned with Milk.

Tutu|issue=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tavistock Institute became known as a major proponent in Britain for psychoanalysis and the psychodynamic theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and his followers. Other names associated with the Tavistock include [[Melanie Klein]], [[Carl Gustav Jung]], [[J. A. Hadfield]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Charles Rycroft]], [[Enid_Mumford|Enid Mumford]] and [[R. D. Laing]].{{refn|Laing came to the Tavistock Institute in 1956 at the invitation of Jock Sutherland, who was then director of the Tavistock Clinic, to train on a grant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1263]&lt;/ref&gt; His training, under Charles Rycroft, was at the Institute of Psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/laing.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Current activities==
The Tavistock Institute engages in educational, research, consultancy and professional development work in the [[social sciences]] and [[applied psychology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Its clients are diverse, ranging from public sector organisations, including the [[European Union]], several [[Politics of the United Kingdom|British government]] departments, Third Sector and private clients. The Institute owns [[Human Relations (journal)|''Human Relations'']], the international social sciences journal. It also edits the journal ''Evaluation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/journal/evaluation#description|title=Evaluation {{!}} SAGE Publications Ltd|website=uk.sagepub.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus of conspiracy theorists==
The Tavistock Institute is associated with conspiracy theories, the most common of which associate it with [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Two books focusing on this are ''The Tavistock Institute of Human Relations: Shaping the Moral, Spiritual, Cultural and Political'' (2006) by John Coleman and ''Tavistock Institute: Social Engineering the Masses'' (2015) by [[Daniel Estulin]].

The ''Rough Guide to Conspiracy Theories'' notes that the Tavistock Institute has been named by some conspiracy theorists in their worldviews, including having a part in "The most extravagant anti-[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati]] conspiracy theory" of John Coleman "known as [the] 'Aquarian Conspiracy'. This totalitarian agenda culminates in the Illuminati 'taking control of education in America with the intent and purpose of utterly and completely destroying it.'" By "'means of rock music and drugs to rebel against the status quo, thus undermining and eventually destroying the family unit'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Rough Guides|date=February 4, 2013|ISBN=1409362450|title=The Rough Guide to Conspiracy Theories, Third Edition|author1=James McConnachie |author2=Robin Tudge }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[HuffPo|The Huffington Post]]'' also mentioned this idea "from popular conspiracy theorist Dr John Coleman", saying that "The Tavistock Institute is a publicly known British charity founded in 1947, but conspiracy theorists believe the Institute's real purpose is to similarly engineer the world's culture." The ''Post'' looks at Coleman's claim that the popularity of the Beatles was an Illuminati plot to advance the "Aquarian Conspiracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Beatles Fan Theories You'll Think Are So Crazy They Might Just Be True|author=Todd Van Luling|publisher=The Huffington Post|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/03/the-beatles-fan-theories_n_6258074.html|date=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Independent countries: This category has independent countries, which the CIA defines as people "politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory".&lt;ref name="ents"/&gt; In this category, there are 195 entities.
; Others: The ''Other'' category is a list of other places set apart from the list of independent countries. Currently there are two: [[Taiwan]] and the [[European Union]].
; Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty: This category is a list of places affiliated with another country. They may be subdivided into categories using the country they are affiliated with:
:*[[Australia]]: six entities
:*[[China]]: two entities
:*[[Denmark]]: two entities
:*[[France]]: eight entities
:*[[Netherlands]]: three entities
:*[[New Zealand]]: three entities
:*[[Norway]]: three entities
:*[[United Kingdom]]: seventeen entities
:*[[United States]]: fourteen entities
; Miscellaneous: This category is for [[Antarctica]] and places in dispute. There are '''six''' entities.

=== Factual ===
The Factbook is full of usually minor errors, inaccuracies, and out-of-date information, which are often repeated elsewhere due to the ''Factbook''{{'}}s widespread use as a reference.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}{{dubious|date=April 2018}} For example, [[Albania]] was until recently, described in the ''Factbook'' as 70% [[Muslim]], 20% [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and 10% [[Roman Catholic]], which was based on a survey conducted in 1939, before [[World War II]]; numerous surveys conducted since the fall of the Communist regime since 1990 have given quite different figures.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Another example is [[Singapore]], which the ''Factbook'' states has a [[total fertility rate]] of 0.78 children per woman, despite figures in Statistics Singapore which state that the rate has been about 1.2–1.3 children per woman for at least the past several years, and it is unclear when, or even whether, it ever dropped as low as 0.78.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/latest_data.html#14 Statistics Singapore – Latest Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105202002/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/latest_data.html |date=2014-11-05 }}.

In June 2009, [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), relying on information obtained from the ''CIA World Factbook'', put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the [[West Bank]] and Israeli-annexed [[East Jerusalem]] at 250,000. However, a better estimate, based on [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and Israeli sources put the figure at about 500,000. NPR then issued a correction. Chuck Holmes, foreign editor for NPR Digital, said, "I'm surprised and displeased, and it makes me wonder what other information is out-of-date or incorrect in the CIA ''World Factbook''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2010/06/01/127349281/cia-gets-the-numbers-wrong

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11543">The '''topological derivative''' is, conceptually, a [[derivative]] of a shape functional with respect to infinitesimal changes in its topology, such as adding an infinitesimal hole or crack. When used in higher dimensions than one, the term '''topological gradient''' is also used to name the first-order term of the topological asymptotic expansion, dealing only with infinitesimal singular domain perturbations. It has applications in [[shape optimization]], [[topology optimization]], [[image processing]] and mechanical modeling.

== Definition ==

Let &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; be an open bounded domain of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^d &lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; d \geq 2 &lt;/math&gt;, which is subject to a nonsmooth perturbation confined in a small region &lt;math&gt; \omega_\varepsilon(\tilde{x}) = \tilde{x} + \varepsilon \omega &lt;/math&gt; of size &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \tilde{x} &lt;/math&gt; an arbitrary point of &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; a fixed domain of &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^d &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; \Psi &lt;/math&gt; be a characteristic function associated to the unperturbed domain and &lt;math&gt; \Psi_\varepsilon &lt;/math&gt; be a characteristic function associated to the perforated domain &lt;math&gt; \Omega_\varepsilon = \Omega \backslash \overline{\omega_\varepsilon} &lt;/math&gt;. A given shape functional &lt;math&gt; \Phi(\Psi_\varepsilon(\tilde{x})) &lt;/math&gt; associated to the topologically perturbed domain, admits the following '''topological asymptotic expansion''':

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; \Phi(\Psi_\varepsilon(\tilde{x})) = \Phi(\Psi) + f(\varepsilon) g(\tilde{x}) + o(f(\varepsilon)) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Phi(\Psi) &lt;/math&gt; is the shape functional associated to the reference domain, &lt;math&gt; f(\varepsilon) &lt;/math&gt; is a positive first order correction function of &lt;math&gt; \Phi(\Psi) &lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt; o(f(\varepsilon)) &lt;/math&gt; is the remainder. The function &lt;math&gt; g(\tilde{x}) &lt;/math&gt; is called the topological derivative of &lt;math&gt; \Phi &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; \tilde{x} &lt;/math&gt;.

== Applications ==

=== Structural mechanics ===
The topological derivative can be applied to shape optimization problems in structural mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;J. Sokolowski and A. Zochowski, [http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/07/35/18/PDF/RR-3170.pdf 44On topological derivative in shape optimization44], 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The topological derivative can be considered as the singular limit of the shape derivative. It is a generalization of this classical tool in shape optimization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lama.univ-savoie.fr/ANR-GAOS/CIRM2012/Conferences/Jan-LUMINY.pdf Topological Derivatives in Shape Optimization], Jan Sokołowski, May 28, 2012. Retrieved November 9, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Shape optimization concerns itself with finding an optimal shape. That is, find &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; to minimize some scalar-valued [[objective function]], &lt;math&gt;J(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;. The topological derivative technique can be coupled with [[level-set method]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Allaire, F. Jouve, ''Coupling the level set method and the topological gradient in structural optimization'', in IUTAM symposium on topological design optimization of structures, machines and materials, M. Bendsoe et al. eds., pp3-12, Springer (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the topological asymptotic expansion for the [[Laplace equation]] with respect to the insertion of a short crack inside a plane domain had been found. It allows to detect and locate cracks for a simple model problem: the steady-state heat equation with the heat flux imposed and the temperature measured on the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;S. Amstutz, I. Horchani, and M. Masmoudi. ''[http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/cc/cc34/cc3415.pdf Crack detection by the topological gradient method]''. Control and Cybernetics, 34(1):81–101, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The topological derivative had been fully developed for a wide range of second-order differential operators and in 2011, it had been applied to [[Kirchhoff–Love plate theory|Kirchhoff plate bending problem]] with a fourth-order operator.&lt;ref&gt;S. Amstutz, A.A. Novotny, [http://www.univ-avignon.fr/fileadmin/documents/Users/Fiches_X_P/platesfi.pdf Topological asymptotic analysis of the Kirchhoff plate bending problem]. ESAIM: COCV 17(3), pp. 705-721, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Image processing ===
In the field of image processing, in 2006, the topological derivative has been used to perform [[edge detection]] and [[image restoration]]. The impact of an insulating crack in the domain is studied. The topological sensitivity gives information on the image edges. The presented  algorithm is non-iterative and thanks to the use of spectral methods has a short computing time.&lt;ref&gt;L. J. Belaid, M. Jaoua, M. Masmoudi, and L. Siala. ''Image restoration and edge detection by topological asymptotic expansion''. CRAS Paris, 342(5):313–318, March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Only &lt;math&gt;O(Nlog(N))&lt;/math&gt; operations are needed to detect edges, where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the number of pixels.&lt;ref name="Image processing by topological asymptotic analysis"&gt;D. Auroux and M. Masmoudi. ''Image processing by topological asymptotic analysis''. ESAIM: Proc. Mathematical methods for imaging and inverse problems, 26:24–44, April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years, other problems have been considered: classification, [[segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]], [[inpainting]] and [[super-resolution]].&lt;ref name="Image processing by topological asymptotic analysis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.

Auroux, L. Jaafar Belaid, and B. Rjaibi. ''[http://math.unice.fr/~auroux/Work/Articles/DZ.pdf Application of the topological gradient method to color image restoration]''. SIAM J. Imaging Sci., 3(2):153–175, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2010, isotropic diffusion was used for image reconstructions. The topological gradient is also able to provide edge orientation and this information can be used to perform [[anisotropic diffusion]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Larnier and J. Fehrenbach. ''[http://homepages.laas.fr/slarnier/Edge_detection_and_anisotropic_diffusion_with_anisotropic_topological_gradient.pdf Edge detection and image restoration with anisotropic topological gradient]''. In 2010 IEEE [[International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing]] (ICASSP), pages 1362–1365, March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a general framework is presented to reconstruct an image &lt;math&gt; u \in L^2(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt; given some noisy observations &lt;math&gt; Lu+n &lt;/math&gt; in a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; is the domain where the image &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; is defined.&lt;ref name=larnier2012/&gt; The observation space &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; depends on the specific application as well as the linear observation operator &lt;math&gt; L : L^2(\Omega) \rightarrow E &lt;/math&gt;. The norm on the space &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; \|.\|_E &lt;/math&gt;. The idea to recover the original image is to minimize the following functional for &lt;math&gt; u \in H^1(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;  \| C^{1/2} \nabla u \|_{L^2(\Omega)}^2 + \|Lu-v\|_E^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; is a positive definite tensor. The first term of the equation ensures that the recovered image &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; is regular, and the second term measures the discrepancy with the data.
In this general framework, different types of image reconstruction can be performed such as&lt;ref name=larnier2012/&gt;
* [[image denoising]] with &lt;math&gt; E=L^2(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Lu=u &lt;/math&gt;,
* image denoising and deblurring with &lt;math&gt; E=L^2(\Omega) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Lu=\phi \ast u &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; a [[motion blur]] or [[Gaussian blur]],
* [[inpainting|image inpainting]] with &lt;math&gt; E=L^2(\Omega\backslash\omega) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Lu=u|_{\Omega\backslash\omega} &lt;/math&gt;, the subset &lt;math&gt; \omega \subset\Omega &lt;/math&gt; is the region where the image has to be recovered.
In this framework, the asymptotic expansion of the cost function &lt;math&gt; J_\Omega(u_\Omega) = \frac{1}{2} \int_\Omega u_\Omega^2 &lt;/math&gt; in the case of a crack provides the same topological derivative &lt;math&gt;g(x,n) = - \pi c (\nabla u_0.n) (\nabla p_0.n) - \pi(\nabla u_0.n)^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is the normal to the crack and &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; a constant diffusion coefficient. The functions &lt;math&gt; u_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p_0 &lt;/math&gt; are solutions of the following direct and adjoint problems.&lt;ref name=larnier2012/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -\nabla ( c \nabla u_0 ) + L^* L u_0 = L^* v&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \partial_n u_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; -\nabla ( c \nabla p_0 ) + L^* L p_0 = \Delta u_0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \partial_n p_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
Thanks to the topological gradient, it is possible to detect the edges and their orientation and to define an appropriate &lt;math&gt; C &lt;/math&gt; for the image reconstruction process.&lt;ref name=larnier2012/&gt;

In image processing, the topological derivatives have also been studied in the case of a multiplicative noise of gamma law or in presence of Poissonian statistics.&lt;ref&gt;A. Drogoul, G. Aubert, [http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/01/01/82/00/PDF/drogoul_aubert_Two_Column.pdf The topological gradient method for semi-linear problems and application to edge detection and noise removal.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inverse problems ===
In 2009, the topological gradient method has been applied to [[tomographic reconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Auroux, L. Jaafar Belaid, and B. Rjaibi. ''[http://math.unice.fr/~auroux/Work/Articles/tamtam09.pdf Application of the topological gradient method to tomography]''. In ARIMA Proc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22410">'''Vibrational circular dichroism''' ('''VCD''') is a [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technique which detects differences in attenuation of left and right [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] passing through a sample. It is the extension of [[circular dichroism]] spectroscopy into the [[infrared]] and near infrared ranges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj;from=objects;id=410 Principles of IR and NIR Spectroscopy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because VCD is sensitive to the mutual orientation of distinct groups in a molecule, it provides three-dimensional structural information. Thus, it is a powerful technique as VCD spectra of enantiomers can be simulated using ''ab initio'' calculations, thereby allowing the identification of absolute configurations of small molecules in solution from VCD spectra. Among such quantum computations of VCD spectra resulting from the chiral properties of small organic molecules are those based on [[density functional theory]] (DFT) and [[gauge-invariant]] [[atomic orbitals]] (GIAO). As a simple example of the experimental results that were obtained by VCD are the spectral data obtained within the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) stretching region of 21 [[amino acid]]s in [[heavy water]] solutions. Measurements of vibrational optical activity (VOA) have thus numerous applications, not only for small molecules, but also for large and complex biopolymers such as muscle proteins ([[myosin]], for example) and [[DNA]].

==Theory==
While the fundamental quantity associated with the infrared absorption is the dipole strength, the differential absorption is also proportional to the rotational strength, a quantity which depends on both the electric and magnetic dipole transition moments. Sensitivity of the handedness of a molecule toward circularly polarized light results from the form of the rotational strength. A rigorous theoretical development of VCD was developed concurrently by the late Professor P.J. Stephens, FRS, at the [[University of Southern California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/j100251a006 | volume=89 | title=Theory of vibrational circular dichroism | year=1985 | journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry | pages=748–752 | author=Stephens Philip J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/j100291a009 | volume=91 | title=Gauge dependence of vibrational magnetic dipole transition moments and rotational strengths | year=1987 | journal=The Journal of Physical Chemistry | pages=1712–1715 | author=Stephens P. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the group of Professor A.D. Buckingham, FRS, at [[Cambridge University]] in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0301-0104(87)85017-6 | volume=112 | title=Velocity-dependent property surfaces and the theory of vibrational circular dichroism | year=1987 | journal=Chemical Physics | pages=1–14 | author=Buckingham A.D., Fowler P.W., Galwas P.A.| bibcode=1987CP....112....1B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and first implemented analytically in the Cambridge Analytical Derivative Package (CADPAC) by R.D. Amos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0009-2614(87)80046-5 | volume=133 | title=Efficient calculation of vibrational magnetic dipole transition moments and rotational strengths | year=1987 | journal=Chemical Physics Letters | pages=21–26 | author=Amos R.D., Handy N.C., Jalkanen K.J., Stephens P.J.| bibcode=1987CPL...133...21A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous developments by D.P. Craig and T. Thirmachandiman at the [[Australian National University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00268977800100611 | volume=35 | title=A theory of vibrational circular dichroism in terms of vibronic interactions | year=1978 | journal=Molecular Physics | pages=825–840 | author=Craig D.P., Thirunamachandran T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Larry A. Nafie and Teresa B. Freedman at [[Syracuse University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.444741 | volume=78 | title=Vibronic coupling theory of infrared vibrational transitions | year=1983 | journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics | pages=7108–7116 | author=Nafie Laurence A., Freedman Teresa B.| bibcode=1983JChPh..78.7108N }}&lt;/ref&gt; though theoretically correct, were not able to be straightfowardly implemented, which prevented their use. Only with the development of the Stephens formalism as implemented in CADPAC did a fast efficient and theoretically rigorous theoretical calculation of the VCD spectra of chiral molecules become feasible. This also stimulated the commercialization of VCD instruments by Biotools, Bruker, Jasco and Thermo-Nicolet (now Thermo-Fisher).

The published reports over the last 22 years have established VCD as a powerful technique with improved results over those previously obtained by visible/UV circular dichroism (CD) or [[optical rotatory dispersion]] (ORD) for proteins and nucleic acids.

The effects due to solvent on stabilizing the structures (conformers and zwitterionic species) of amino acids and peptides and the corresponding effects seen in the vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) and Raman optical activity spectra (ROA) have been recently documented by a combined theoretical and experimental work on L-alanine and N-acetyl L-alanine N'-methylamide,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s00214-007-0361-z | volume=119 | title=Role of hydration in determining the structure and vibrational spectra of L-alanine and N-acetyl L-alanine N′-methylamide in aqueous solution: a combined theoretical and experimental approach | year=2007 | journal=Theoretical Chemistry Accounts | pages=191–210 | author=Jalkanen K.

==Nucleic acids==
VCD spectra of nucleotides, synthetic polynucleotides and several nucleic acids, including DNA, have been reported and assigned in terms of the type and number of helices present in A-, B-, and Z-DNA.

==Instrumentation==
VCD can be regarded as a relatively recent technique. Although Vibrational Optical Activity and in particular Vibrational Circular Dichroism, has been known for a long time, the first VCD instrument was developed in 1973&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Nafie, T. A. Keiderling, P. J. Stephens, JACS 1973, 98, 2715&lt;/ref&gt; and commercial instruments were available only since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://btools.com/docs/BioTools_Catalog.pdf BioTools Catalog, page 4] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224025457/http://btools.com/docs/BioTools_Catalog.pdf |date=December 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For biopolymers such as proteins and nucleic acids, the difference in absorbance between the levo- and dextro- configurations is five orders of magnitude smaller than the
corresponding (unpolarized) absorbance. Therefore, VCD of biopolymers requires the use of very sensitive, specially built instrumentation as well as time-averaging over relatively long intervals of time even with such sensitive VCD spectrometers.
Most CD instruments produce left- and right- circularly polarized light which is then either sine-wave or square-wave modulated, with subsequent phase-sensitive detection and lock-in amplification of the detected signal. In the case of FT-VCD,
a photo-elastic modulator (PEM) is employed in conjunction with an FTIR interferometer set-up. An example is that of a Bomem model MB-100 FTIR interferometer equipped with additional polarizing optics/ accessories needed for recording VCD spectra.
A parallel beam emerges through a side port of the interferometer which passes first through a wire grid linear polarizer and then through an octagonal-shaped ZnSe crystal PEM which modulates the polarized beam at a fixed, lower frequency such as 37.5&amp;nbsp;kHz. A mechanically stressed crystal such as ZnSe exhibits [[birefringence]] when stressed by an adjacent piezoelectric transducer. The linear polarizer is positioned close to, and at 45 degrees, with respect to the ZnSe crystal axis. The polarized radiation focused onto the detector is doubly modulated, both by the PEM and by the interferometer setup. A very low noise detector, such as MCT (HgCdTe), is also selected for the VCD signal phase-sensitive detection. The first dedicated VCD spectrometer brought to market was the ChiralIR from Bomem/BioTools, Inc. in 1997.

== Modeling VCD Spectra ==
In 1994, researchers at the University of Southern California (USC)[[United States Army Research Laboratory|, U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] (USARL), and Lorentzian Inc., reported an accuracy ranking of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] analytical techniques to theoretically determine vibrational frequencies, [[dipole]] strengths, and rotational strengths of an organic molecule. This ranking claimed [[Density functional theory#Applications|density functional theory]] (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory was the most accurate and effective computation used to model and vibrational [[circular dichroism]] (VCD)  spectra. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=P.

Theoretical calculations of vibrational energy often involve the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger’s]] equation with the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian operator]]. The computers that process this massive calculation can incorporate the molecule’s kinetic energy as well as the vast number of repulsions and columbic attractions between subatomic particles. The calculations are said to be very costly, as they are difficult and take a long time to accomplish. This is partially because integrating the electron-electron interactions into the equation involves determining electron [[Exchange interaction|exchange interactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.ornl.gov/~kentpr/thesis/pkthnode8.html|title=1.2 Electronic structure calculations|website=web.ornl.gov|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods like DFT and the [[Hartree–Fock method|Hartree Fock]] look at a group of atomic orbitals referred to as a [[Basis set (chemistry)|basis set]] to estimate wave function.

The study conducted by USC, USARL, and Lorentzian Inc. analyzed the infrared ([[Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy|FTIR]]) and VCD spectra of the chiral molecule 4-methyl-2-oxetanone. Lorentzian bands were fit to FTIR and VCD spectra to obtain their peak intensity, line width, and frequency, which may be used to infer properties such as dipole strengths and rotational strengths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These experimental values were then compared to theoretical results. The scientists reported that DFT computations evaluated with the B3LYP functional best modelled FTIR and VCD spectra. To achieve a better cost to benefit ratio the researchers recommended pairing this method with the 6-31* [[Basis set (chemistry)|basis set]]. The second best method reported was the second order [[Møller–Plesset perturbation theory]] (MP2). The third and fourth best calculation methods were DFT with the BLYP and LSDA functionals respectively. The researchers stated that ''Ab initio'' [[Hartree–Fock method| Hartree Fock]] Self Consistent Field (HF-SCF) computations modelled FTIR and VCD spectra with the lowest accuracy compared to other methodologies investigated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The significance in claimed improvement in accuracy of DFT computations over ''ab'' ''initio'' techniques was that DFT computations were reported to quicken computational speed. By evaluating an effective potential using electron density, which can by specified across three degrees of freedom, DFT sidesteps the evaluation of coulombic potentials between every single electron, which is specified over 3N degrees of freedom (where N is the number of electrons). The B3LYP basis set is a hybrid between direct Hartree-Fock exchange terms as well as local and gradient corrections for [[Exchange interaction|exchange]] and [[Electronic correlation|correlation]] interactions. Therefore, the B3LYP functional is claimed to efficiently model FTIR and VCD of some molecules ''via'' DFT at a fraction of the cost. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Raman optical activity (ROA)==
[[Raman optical activity|ROA]] is a technique complementary to VCD especially useful in the 50–1600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; spectral region; it is considered as the technique of choice for determining optical activity for photon energies less than 600&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

In [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]], the '''μ-recursive functions''' are a class of [[partial function]]s from [[natural number]]s to natural numbers that are "computable" in an intuitive sense. In [[Computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], it is shown that the μ-recursive functions are precisely the functions that can be computed by [[Turing machine]]s.  The μ-recursive functions are closely related to [[primitive recursive function]]s, and their inductive definition (below) builds upon that of the primitive recursive functions. However, not every μ-recursive function is a primitive recursive function&amp;mdash;the most famous example is the [[Ackermann function]].

Other equivalent classes of functions are the [[lambda-recursive function|&amp;lambda;-recursive functions]] and the functions that can be computed by [[Markov algorithm]]s.

The set of all recursive functions is known as [[R (complexity)|R]] in [[computational complexity theory]].

==Definition==

The '''μ-recursive functions''' (or '''partial μ-recursive functions''') are partial functions that take finite tuples of natural numbers and return a single natural number.  They are the smallest class of partial functions that includes the initial functions and is closed under composition, primitive recursion, and the [[μ operator]].

The smallest class of functions including the initial functions and closed under composition and primitive recursion (i.e. without minimisation) is the class of [[primitive recursive functions]].  While all primitive recursive functions are total, this is not true of partial recursive functions; for example, the minimisation of the successor function is undefined. The primitive recursive functions are a subset of the total recursive functions, which are a subset of the partial recursive functions. For example, the [[Ackermann function]] can be proven to be total recursive, but not primitive.

Initial or "basic" functions: (In the following the subscripting is per Kleene (1952) p.&amp;nbsp;219. For more about some of the various symbolisms found in the literature see [[#Symbolism|Symbolism]] below.)

#'''Constant function''': For each natural number &lt;math&gt;n\,&lt;/math&gt; and every &lt;math&gt;k\,&lt;/math&gt;:
#:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) = n\,&lt;/math&gt;.
#:Alternative definitions use compositions of the successor function and use a '''zero function''', that always returns zero, in place of the constant function.
# '''Successor function S:'''  
#: &lt;math&gt;S(x) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} x + 1\,&lt;/math&gt;
# '''Projection function''' &lt;math&gt;P_i^k&lt;/math&gt; (also called the '''Identity function''' &lt;math&gt;I_i^k&lt;/math&gt;): For all natural numbers &lt;math&gt;i, k\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; ≤ &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;:
#: &lt;math&gt;P_i^k(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} x_i \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Operators:

#  '''Composition operator''' &lt;math&gt;\circ\,&lt;/math&gt; (also called the '''substitution operator'''): Given an m-ary function &lt;math&gt;h(x_1,\ldots,x_m)\,&lt;/math&gt; and m k-ary functions &lt;math&gt;g_1(x_1,\ldots,x_k),\ldots,g_m(x_1,\ldots, x_k)&lt;/math&gt;:
#:&lt;math&gt;h \circ (g_1, \ldots, g_m) \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} f \quad\text{where}\quad f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) = h(g_1(x_1,\ldots,x_k),\ldots,g_m(x_1,\ldots,x_k))\,.&lt;/math&gt;
# '''Primitive recursion operator''' &lt;math&gt;\rho\,&lt;/math&gt;: Given the k-ary function &lt;math&gt;g(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\,&lt;/math&gt; and k+2 -ary function &lt;math&gt;h(y,z,x_1,\ldots,x_k)\,&lt;/math&gt;:
#: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
             \rho(g, h) &amp;\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} f \quad\text{where}\\
    f(0,x_1,\ldots,x_k) &amp;= g(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \\
  f(y+1,x_1,\ldots,x_k) &amp;= h(y,f(y,x_1,\ldots,x_k),x_1,\ldots,x_k)\,.\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
#'''Minimisation operator''' &lt;math&gt;\mu\,&lt;/math&gt;: Given a (k+1)-ary total function &lt;math&gt;f(y, x_1, \ldots, x_k)\,&lt;/math&gt;:
#:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
          \mu(f)(x_1, \ldots, x_k) = z \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{\iff}\ f(z, x_1, \ldots, x_k)&amp;=0\quad \text{and}\\
             f(i, x_1, \ldots, x_k)&amp;&gt;0 \quad \text{for}\quad i=0, \ldots, z-1.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
#:Intuitively, minimisation seeks—beginning the search from 0 and proceeding upwards—the smallest argument that causes the function to return zero; if there is no such argument, the search never terminates.

The '''strong equality''' operator &lt;math&gt;\simeq&lt;/math&gt; can be used to compare partial μ-recursive functions.  This is defined for all partial functions ''f'' and ''g'' so  that
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \simeq g(x_1,\ldots,x_l)&lt;/math&gt; 
holds if and only if for any choice of arguments either both functions are defined and their values are equal or both functions are undefined.

== Equivalence with other models of computability ==

{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}

In the [[Church's thesis|equivalence of models of computability]], a parallel is drawn between [[Turing machine]]s that do not terminate for certain inputs and an undefined result for that input in the corresponding partial recursive function.
The unbounded search operator is not definable by the rules of primitive recursion as those do not provide a mechanism for "infinite loops" (undefined values).

== Normal form theorem ==

A [[Kleene's T predicate#Normal form theorem|normal form theorem]] due to Kleene says that for each ''k'' there are primitive recursive functions &lt;math&gt;U(y)\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T(y,e,x_1,\ldots,x_k)\!&lt;/math&gt; such that for any μ-recursive function &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_k)\!&lt;/math&gt; with ''k'' free variables there is an ''e'' such that  
:&lt;math&gt;f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) \simeq U(\mu y\, T(y,e,x_1,\ldots,x_k))&lt;/math&gt;.
The number ''e'' is called an '''index''' or '''Gödel number''' for the function ''f''.  A consequence of this result is that any μ-recursive function can be defined using a single instance of the μ operator applied to a (total) primitive recursive function.

Minsky (1967) observes (as does Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) pp.&amp;nbsp;94–95) that the U defined above is in essence the μ-recursive equivalent of the [[universal Turing machine]]:
:To construct U is to write down the definition of a general-recursive function U(n, x) that correctly interprets the number n and computes the appropriate function of x. to construct U directly would involve essentially the same amount of effort, ''and essentially the same ideas'', as we have invested in constructing the universal Turing machine. (italics in original, Minsky (1967) p. 189)

== Symbolism ==
A number of different symbolisms are used in the literature. An advantage to using the symbolism is a derivation of a function by "nesting" of the operators one inside the other is easier to write in a compact form. In the following we will abbreviate the string of parameters x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; as '''x''':  
* '''Constant function''': Kleene uses " C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;('''x''') = q " and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) (B-B-J) use the abbreviation " const&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;( '''x''') = n ": 
:: e.g. C&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; ( r, s, t, u, v, w, x ) = 13
:: e.g. const&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; ( r, s, t, u, v, w, x ) = 13

* '''Successor function''': Kleene uses x' and S for "Successor". As "successor" is considered to be primitive, most texts use the apostrophe as follows: 
:: S(a) = a +1 =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; a', where 1 =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt;  0', 2 =&lt;sub&gt;def&lt;/sub&gt; 0 ' ', etc.

* '''Identity function''': Kleene (1952) uses " U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; " to indicate the identity function over the variables x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;; B-B-J use the identity function id&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; over the variables x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;:
: U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;( '''x''' ) = id&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;( '''x''' ) = x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; 
: e.g. U&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; = id&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; ( r, s, t, u, v, w, x ) = t

* '''Composition (Substitution) operator''': Kleene uses a bold-face '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; (not to be confused with his S for "successor" '''!''' ). The superscript "m" refers to the m&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of function "f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;", whereas the subscript "n" refers to the n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; variable "x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;":
:If we are given h( '''x''' )= g( f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;('''x'''), ... , f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') )
::  h('''x''') = '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(g, f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; )

:In a similar manner, but without the sub- and superscripts, B-B-J write: 
:: h(''x''')= Cn[g, f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ,..., f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;]('''x''')

* '''Primitive Recursion''': Kleene uses the symbol " '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(base step, induction step) " where n indicates the number of variables, B-B-J use " Pr(base step, induction step)('''x''')". Given:
:* base step: h( 0, '''x''' )= f( '''x''' ), and
:* induction step: h( y+1, '''x''' ) = g( y, h(y, '''x'''),'''x''' )
 
: Example: primitive recursion definition of a + b:
::* base step: f( 0, a ) = a = U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(a)
::* induction step: f( b' , a ) = ( f ( b, a ) )' = g( b, f( b, a), a ) = g( b, c, a ) = c' = S(U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;( b, c, a ))
::: R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; { U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(a), S [ (U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;( b, c, a ) ] }
::: Pr{ U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(a), S[ (U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;( b, c, a ) ] }

'''Example''': Kleene gives an example of how to perform the recursive derivation of f(b, a) = b + a (notice reversal of variables a and b). He starts with 3 initial functions 
:# S(a) = a'
:# U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(a) = a
:# U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;( b, c, a ) = c
:# g(b, c, a) = S(U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;( b, c, a )) = c'
:# base step: h( 0, a ) = U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(a)
:: induction step: h( b', a ) = g( b, h( b, a ), a )

He arrives at:
:: a+b = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[ U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, '''S'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;(S, U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) ]
