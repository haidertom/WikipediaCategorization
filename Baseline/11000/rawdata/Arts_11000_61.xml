'''Allegorical sculpture''' refers to sculptures that symbolize and particularly personify abstract ideas as in [[allegory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_A.html|title=Literary Terms and Definitions A|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common in the [[western world]], for example, are statues of [[Lady Justice]] representing [[justice]], traditionally holding scales and a [[Sword of Justice|sword]], and the statues of [[Prudence]], representing Truth by holding a mirror and squeezing a serpent.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thake |first1=Conrad |title=The Architectural legacy of Grand Master Pinto (2) |url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-05-16/local-news/The-Architectural-legacy-of-Grand-Master-Pinto-(2)-207685 |work=[[The Malta Independent]] |date=16 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801192321/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-05-16/local-news/The-Architectural-legacy-of-Grand-Master-Pinto-%282%29-207685 |archivedate=1 August 2016 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This approach of using human form and its posture, gesture and clothing to wordlessly convey [[Value system|social value]]s and [[Theme (arts)|theme]]s.
It may be seen in [[church monument|funerary art]] as early as 1580. They were used on [[renaissance]] monuments when [[patron saint]]s became unacceptable. Particularly popular were the [[four cardinal virtues]] and the [[Theological virtues|three Christian virtues]], but others such as [[Pheme|fame]], [[Victoria (mythology)|victory]], [[hope]] and [[Father time|time]] are also represented. The use of allegorical sculpture was fully developed under the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. It is sometimes associated with [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art, and is commonly found in works dating from around 1900.

[[File:Klee, paul, angelus novus, 1920.jpg|''Angelus Novus''|thumb|right|240px]]

'''''Angelus Novus''''' (New Angel) is a 1920 [[monoprint]] by the Swiss-German artist [[Paul Klee]], using the oil transfer method he invented. It is now in the collection of the [[Israel Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]].

In the ninth thesis of his 1940 essay “[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]”, the German critic and philosopher [[Walter Benjamin]], who purchased the print in 1921, interprets it this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Klee painting named ''Angelus Novus'' shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, "[[Theses on the Philosophy of History]]", Illuminations, trans. Harry Zohn, New York: Schocken Books, 1969: 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Otto Karl Werckmeister notes that Benjamin's reading of Klee's New Angel image has led to it becoming "an icon of the [[political left|left]]."&lt;ref&gt;Werkmeister, ''Icons of the Left: Benjamin and Einstein, Picasso and Kafka After the Fall.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997: 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name and concept of the angel has inspired works by other artists, filmmakers, writers and musicians, including [[John Akomfrah]], [[Ariella Azoulay]], [[Carolyn Forché]], and [[Rabih Alameddine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lux.org.uk/collection/works/last-angel-history|title= ''Last Angel of History''|year=2013|accessdate=20 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zingmagazine.com/zing6/reviews/angelus.html|title= zing6 - reviews - angelus nova|publisher=''Zing Magazine''|year=1997|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/sandh/2000/june00/munchener.htm|title= Seventh Munchener Biennale|date=4–19 May 2000|accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1940 Walter Benjamin committed suicide during an attempt to flee the Nazi regime. After World War II Walter Benjamin’s lifelong friend, [[Gershom Scholem]] (1897–1982), the distinguished scholar of Jewish mysticism, inherited the drawing. According to Scholem, Benjamin felt a mystical identification with the ''Angelus Novus'' and incorporated it in his theory of the “angel of history,” a melancholy view of historical process as an unceasing cycle of despair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/collections/item.asp?itemNum=199799 Angelus Novus] at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, in conjunction with her solo exhibition at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, American artist [[R. H. Quaytman]] discovered that the monoprint had been adhered to an 1838 copper-plate engraving by Friedrich Muller after a [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]] portrait of [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cotter|first1=Holland|title=R.H.

'''Anti-clerical art''' is a genre of art portraying clergy, especially [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] clergy, in unflattering contexts.  It was especially popular in France during the second half of the 19th century, at a time that the anti-clerical message suited the prevailing political mood.  Typical paintings show [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] in their bright red robes engaging in unseemly activities within their lavish private quarters.

Nineteenth and early twentieth century artists known for their anti-clerical art include [[Francesco Brunery]], [[Georges Croegaert]], [[Charles Édouard Delort]], [[Jehan Georges Vibert]], [[Jules Benoit-Levy]] and [[Eduardo Zamacois y Zabala]].  [[Masami Teraoka]] is among the contemporary painters producing anti-clerical art.

'''''Artistry of the Mentally Ill: a contribution to the psychology and psychopathology of configuration''''' ({{lang-de|Bildnerei der Geisteskranken: ein Beitrag zur Psychologie und Psychopathologie der Gestaltung}}) is a 1922 book by [[psychiatrist]] [[Hans Prinzhorn]], known as the work that launched the field of [[outsider art|psychiatric art]]. It was the first attempt to analyze the drawings of the mentally ill not merely psychologically, but also [[aesthetic]]ally.

In the book, Prinzhorn presents the works of ten "[[schizophrenic]] masters", now housed in Prinzhorn Collection at the [[University Hospital Heidelberg]], with in-depth aesthetic analysis of each and also full-color reproductions of their work. These ten masters were (birth names in parentheses):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/fileadmin/pressestelle/pressemappen/Kuenstlerliste.pdf Kuenstlerliste]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several incidents involving '''controversial caricatures in the press media'''.

==International stories==
===Muhammed cartoons and response===
*The [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]], involving unflattering depictions of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] first published in [[Denmark]] in September 2005 and subsequently in other countries, lead to wide-scale protesting and rioting.
*On February 7, 2006 the [[Arab European League]] published multiple cartoons suggesting [[Holocaust denial]] in response to the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammed cartoons]] published months earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060223060635/http://www.arabeuropean.org/newsimages/1139405537cartoon_2recised.jpg |date=February 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506123749/http://www.arabeuropean.org/newsimages/1139315849ayanrecised.JPG |date=May 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209025823/http://www.arabeuropean.org/newsimages/200602051139183570L.jpg |date=February 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210050242/http://www.arabeuropean.org/newsimages/200602051139183647L.jpg |date=February 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Need citation on whether or not a Jewish submitted an anti-Semitic cartoon --&gt;

===The Arab world===
Many Muslim Middle Eastern newspapers have frequently published cartoons with allegedly [[anti-Semitic]] themes, or those created or inspired by [[Nazism|Nazi]]-style propaganda. These newspapers have generally claimed to be anti-Israeli but not anti-Jewish. Some examples:{{cn|date=April 2012}} 
*On June 6, 2002, Akhbar al-Khalij from Bahrain published a cartoon showing an Israeli Jew piercing a baby with a spear.
*On July 24, 2002 Al Watan from Qatar published a cartoon of [[Ariel Sharon]], the then [[Prime Minister of Israel]], drinking from a cup of Palestinian children's blood. 
*On December 17, 2001, Keyhan published a cartoon showing a Jewish Israeli Soldier in front of a Holocaust scenery, killing Arabs. 
*Almost all Israeli prime ministers in the last 15 years (Shamir, Peres, Rabin, Barak, Sharon) have been depicted as Nazis. Israeli Jews have been depicted as spiders,&lt;ref&gt;(Palestinian Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, Oct. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; octopuses,&lt;ref&gt;(Palestinian Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, April 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; scorpions,&lt;ref&gt;(Saudi Arabia, Al-Riyadh, Dec. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; snakes,&lt;ref&gt;Syria, Tishrin, April 30, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; thieves or other menacing-looking persons with exaggerated "Jewish" characteristics.  
*On May 17, 2001 the Palestinian Al Quds published a cartoon depicting then [[Prime Minister of Israel]], [[Ariel Sharon]], eating Palestinian children.

==By country==
===Spain===
*On July 20, 2007, the cartoon on the front page of the weekly satirical magazine ''[[El Jueves]]'' whose front page carried a drawing of Crown [[Felipe de Borbón|Prince Felipe]] having sex with [[Letizia Ortiz|his wife]] and commenting on a government plan to give parents [[Euro|€]] 2 500 for each child born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.20minutos.es/data/img/2007/07/20/657066.jpg Cover of July 20, 2007 ''El Jueves'']&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Juan del Olmo ruled that the cartoon "''struck at the honour and dignity of the people represented.''"

===Canada===
*On March 2, 2006, the Student newspaper [[the Sheaf]] from the [[University of Saskatchewan]], published a cartoon entitled "[[Capitalist Piglet]]" which featured [[Jesus]] performing a sexual act with a [[Pig]] (which was intended to represent [[Capitalism]]). The Cartoon was published in the wake of the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]], and the paper apologised for the incident four days later, and the editor resigned the following day.{{cn|date=April 2012}}

===France===
*In May 2002, ''[[Le Monde]]'' in France published a cartoon comparing the destruction following the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] with the destruction caused by Israeli military following the [[Battle of Jenin 2002|Battle of Jenin]]. The text below it says: "History has a strange way of repeating itself!"{{cn|date=April 2012}}

===Indonesia===
On 27 March 2006, Indonesian daily [[Rakyat Merdeka]] [[West Papuan refugee crisis#Cartoons|published a cartoon]] on its front page depicting the Australian Prime Minister and Foreign minister as dingoes discussing the acquisition of the Indonesian province of [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]]. ''[[The Australian]]'' responded on 1 April with a [[Bill Leak]] cartoon depicting the Indonesian President as a dog copulating with a West Papuan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/cartoon-anger-fears/2006/04/01/1143441378824.html|newspaper=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=2 April 2006|first1=Tom|last1=Hyland|first2=Penelope|last2=Debelle|title=Cartoon anger fears|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002111754/http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/cartoon-anger-fears/2006/04/01/1143441378824.html|archivedate=2 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iran===
*In the [[Iran newspaper cockroach cartoon controversy]], on 23 May 2006, the Iranian government suspended publication of a state-owned newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5008420.stm Iranian paper banned over cartoon] BBC. 11;41 UC 23/05/2006 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
*Mexican cartoonists enjoy a broad freedom of speech, which has allowed the publication of cartoons which are ''normal'' in Mexico, but quite controversial in the American point of view. For example, two days after the [[September 11 attacks]], [[La Jornada]] newspaper published a cartoon where ''El Fisgon'' makes a comparison between the attacks and the multiple US military operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJw4s5GzrD8C&amp;q=Jornada+%2213+september%22+#v=onepage&amp;q=Jornada%20%2213%20september%22&amp;f=false |title=And why? |author=El Fisgon |publisher=La Jornada}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Jornada also published in September 2001 another cartoon where ''Magu'' states that: "As the world (global) policemen of the new millennium, the Americans are using torture techniques invented by the Mexican police in the last century".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJw4s5GzrD8C&amp;q=Magu+Jornada#v=onepage&amp;q=Magu%20Jornada&amp;f=false |title=Security Reasons |author=Magu |publisher=La Jornada}}&lt;/ref&gt; The freedom of speech extends to other Mexican newspapers. [[El Universal (Mexico City)]] published several cartoons where ''Boligan'' criticizes American military operations in Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJw4s5GzrD8C&amp;q=sorpresa+universal#v=onepage&amp;q=sorpresa%20universal&amp;f=false |title=Oh, Surprise |author=Boligan |publisher=El Universal}}&lt;/ref&gt; specially presenting a pair of soldiers as vultures who complain about the Mexican illegal immigration to the US, when at the same time they are invading Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJw4s5GzrD8C&amp;q=ilegales+universal#v=onepage&amp;q=ilegales%20universal&amp;f=false |title=Illegals |author=Boligan |publisher=El Universal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===United Kingdom===
*On January 27, 2003, the day before Israeli elections, British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' published a cartoon&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031226013529/http://homepage.mac.com/cfj/.Pictures/independent-sharon-toon.jpg |date=December 26, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; depicting the Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon naked (with an Election badge acting as a Fig-leaf) sitting among bombed houses eating a baby while helicopters and tanks buzzed 'Vote Sharon', with Sharon saying "What's wrong, haven't you seen a politician kissing babies before". The cartoon was based on [[Goya]]'s [[Saturn Devouring His Son]] and was penned after a pre-election raid by Israeli missiles on [[Gaza City]]. The cartoon was eventually selected as the "Cartoon of the Year" by the United Kingdom's Political Cartoon Society. The Israeli embassy, backed by the Sharon government, issued a complaint saying the cartoon was [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]], however the Press Watchdog, the [[press complaints commission]], said of the cartoon; "There is nothing inherently anti-semitic about the Goya image or about the myth of Saturn devouring his children, which has been used previously to satirise other politicians accused of sacrificing their own 'children' for political purposes".{{cn|date=April 2012}}

===United States===
*[[Blackface|Racist caricatures]] of [[African American]]s have also appeared in the United States before the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and occasionally since then as well. 
*During [[World War II]], several American newspapers and major animated studios put out cartoons and films depicting the Japanese with exaggerated Asian features and as being untrustworthy or trickster figures, echoing the anti-Japanese racist sentiments common during the war period. 
*A cartoon in ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', published in October 2000, shows a Jew and a Muslim, praying at a wall where the stones are formed to read "Hate". Below the cartoon the inscription says "Worshiping their God". According to the cartoonist, it showed "BOTH Israelis AND Palestinians worshipping 'hate.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/outrage/hate.htm Barbara and David Mikkelson. "Hate" [[Snopes]]; November 28, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jesus Dress Up]] is a game that was created by artist [[Normal Bob Smith]] in 1991 as a black-and-white colorform, which he photocopied and distributed to friends.

[[File:Costa Rican - Bird Pendant - Walters 421511 - Three Quarter.jpg|thumb|150px|Jade bird pendant from Costa Rica]]
[[Jadeite]] is presumed one of the most precious materials of [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Costa Rica]].  It, along with other similar looking greenstones ( ex. [[chalcedony]], [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], and green [[jasper]]) were cherished and worked for years.  Jadeite was used to decorate the body and was presumably a symbol of power.

== Timeline ==

There are three main periods in Costa Rican [[Jade]] Tradition, they correspond with the second half of Mid-Preclassic to Late Classic Periods in [[Mesoamerica]].

# Beginning Period: 500 BC- 300 AD
# Fluorescent Period: 300-900 AD
# Decadent Period: 700-900 AD

The end of the [[jade]] tradition in [[Costa Rica]] corresponds with the beginning of gold work.

== Jade working==
Jadeite rates between 6-7 on the [[Mohs scale of hardness]], therefore making it extremely tough and time consuming to work because it was necessary to use minerals of equal or harder value.  Abrasive powders made of these minerals were often used to carve into the material.  Some of the main techniques used were pecking, drilling, sawing, carving, engraving and grinding.  String sawing was a technique likely developed by Costa Rican lapidaries, in the northeastern region.  This technique was done by sawing with a cord and a powdered abrasive.  It was used to create curved slits openings, and by drilling a hole in the middle of a piece you could thread the cord through and create a hole. The final process was polishing.

Presumed patterns: &lt;br/&gt;
:High-intensity: this pattern of jade working characterizes the jade objects that took the most time to complete, sometimes years.  They were more time consuming in addition to being more elaborately decorated, with deeper incisions.  
:Low-intensity: this pattern was less time consuming and could be made of softer materials, greenstones that looked like jadeite.  They were less valuable because they were made from local materials.  It was socially motivated by the high-intensity pattern.

== Jade objects ==

Most of the jade objects recorded are from looted context, but when found in situ the objects are primarily in graves.  The bulk of Costa Rican jades contain drilled holes so they can be utilized to decorate the body in bead and pendant form.  There are three main types of objects listed here.

1. Axe Gods: Generally these are stylized figure pendants that look like they were made from axes or celts.  They are two-dimensionally decorated on the front with three main segments.  The first is the top of the head to the top of the shoulders, where holes are drilled to suspend the object.  The second is from the top of the shoulders to the bottom of the wings or arms.  The third section is the blade of the pendant, it goes from the bottom of the wings or arms to the base, which consists of 30-40% of the entire pendant.  There are two types of Axe god figurines, Avian and Anthropomorphic.  The earliest known jade work is the Avian axe god celt found at the site of La Regla, dated at 500 BC.

2.  Beak Birds: These are characteristic for their large, stylized beak.  All were drilled through their neck so when strung to hang the beak would be projecting.  The figures are very diverse in size and shape.  The beaks are either straight, or curved pointing up or down.  Some of the beaks are curved into a spiral, and attached to the body presenting the string saw technique.

3.  Bar Pendants:  These are horizontal and usually winged.  They are drilled with two holes through the length of the pendant or drilled parallel to each other through the width of the pendant.  Examples of this type are open-winged bats, double headed winged bats, double headed bar with reptile heads at either end, opened winged bats with reptile heads at both ends, or plain with no incised decoration.

== Likely source and trade patterns ==

Most of the jade work in Costa Rica was done with a particular type. It was a deep, blue-green color, and the same type the [[Olmecs]] used.  In 1998 an enormous region of this particular jade was uncovered after a hurricane in [[Guatemala]].  The area is located in south east Guatemala In the Motagua River Valley.  It is about the size of Rhode Island, and has evidence of ancient mining.  This is the likely source of both the Olmec and Costa Rican jade.  This implies a significant long-distance trade hundreds of years before Christ.  Postulated by David Mora there was a direct exchange network between the previously mentioned area in Guatemala (in the Mayan lowlands) and the northwestern/ central areas of Costa Rica between 300 BC and 800 AD, in which Costa Ricans obtain jade.  Also, the jade tradition died down due to the collapse of (the Olmec's) [[Copan]], the presumed trade center for the jade.

'''Juan Bautista Diógenes Hequet''', or '''Hecquet''' (26 September 1866, [[Montevideo]] - 28 August 1902, Montevideo) was an Uruguayan painter, graphic artist and professor, best known for his [[Military art|battle scenes]].

== Biography ==
His first art lessons were in the workshop of his father, the French-born [[lithographer]], José Adolfo Hequet (1826-1888). In 1886, he went to Paris to perfect his etching techniques with {{ill|Louis Tauzin|fr}}. Two years later, he enrolled at the municipal art school in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris|14th arrondissement]], operated by {{ill|Auguste Truphème|fr|Auguste Truphème (peintre)}}.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[http://www.portondesanpedro.com/autor-curriculum.php?id=437 Brief biography] @ Porton de san Pedro.&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that he first became interested in military art and was influenced by the works of [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Meissonier]], [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville|Neuville]] and [[Édouard Detaille|Detaille]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grumete.com.uy/ayuda/biografia.asp?identificador=149&amp;categoria=646 Biographical notes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603131203/http://www.grumete.com.uy/ayuda/biografia.asp?identificador=149&amp;categoria=646 |date=June 3, 2015 }} @ Grumete.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon returning to Montevideo, he set about producing a large number of historical works. Outstanding among these was a series called "Episodios Nacionales", that depicted all of the principal events in the history of Uruguay, including the "[[Cry of Asencio]]" and   the "[[Battle of Las Piedras (1811)|Battle of Las Piedras]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museohistorico.gub.uy/innovaportal/v/64519/33/mecweb/diogenes-hequet?contid=42669 Biographical notes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150603130550/http://www.museohistorico.gub.uy/innovaportal/v/64519/33/mecweb/diogenes-hequet?contid=42669 |date=June 3, 2015 }} @ the Museo Histórico.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these works, he also created nativist works depicting peasant life and rural landscapes.

In 1893, he made an unsuccessful effort to establish a new school of fine arts. Later he joined with several other Uruguayan artists to create the "Artistic Circle of Uruguay". [[Juan Manuel Blanes]] was its first President.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

Shortly after, he became a Professor at the [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|University of the Republic]], where he held the chairs of drawing (in the "Sección Preparatoria") and ornament (in the "Facultad de Matemáticas"); positions he held until his death. He also provided illustrations for several magazines and newspapers.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

'''Francesc Masriera i Manovens''' (21 October 1842, [[Barcelona]] - 15 March 1902, Barcelona) was a [[Catalonian]] figure painter and [[goldsmith]] who was influenced by [[Orientalism]].

==Biography==
[[File:Taller-Estudi Masriera.png|thumb|175px|left|Taller Masriera, from ''La Ilustració Catalana'' (1884)]]
He was born into a family of painters, set designers and [[silversmith]]s and began his artistic training in his father's workshop.&lt;ref name="E"&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/enciclop%C3%A8dies/gran-enciclop%C3%A8dia-catalana/EC-GEC-0041151.xml#.VI4F6UbTleU Brief biography] @ the Gran Enciclopèdia Catalana&lt;/ref&gt; When he was only thirteen, he went to [[Geneva]] to learn the techniques for painting on enamel. In 1857, he and his brother [[Josep Masriera|Josep]] (who would also become a well-known painter) were apprenticed in the workshop of {{ill|Josep Serra i Porsón|ca}},&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[https://www.museodelprado.es/enciclopedia/enciclopedia-on-line/voz/masriera-y-manovens-francisco/ Brief biography] @ the [[Museo del Prado]]&lt;/ref&gt; a professor at the [[Escola de la Llotja]], followed in 1865 by a trip to London and Paris, where they may have briefly worked in the studios of [[Alexandre Cabanel]].

He opened his first studio in 1871 and participated in the "Exposició General Catalana". The following year, he returned to Paris alone and established contact with [[Goupil &amp; cie]], one of the most important art dealerships at that time. He was awarded second prize at the [[National Exhibition of Fine Arts (Spain)|National Exhibition of Fine Arts]] in 1878 with his painting "La esclava" (The Slave),&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; which was later purchased by King [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]].&lt;ref name="E" /&gt; In 1889, he was awarded a medal at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]]. For most of his life, he was active in the family jewelry business, ''Masriera y Hijos'' (later, ''Hermanos Masrieras'').

Between 1882 and 1884, he and Josep built an elaborate workshop on Bailen Street, modeled after the ancient [[Temple of Augustus in Barcelona|Temple of Augustus]] on Mont Tàber. It was designed by [[Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas]]. Flanking the entrance were statues of [[Eduardo Rosales]] and [[Marià Fortuny]], created by {{ill|Josep Reynés|ca}}. The Masriera's combined art collections were kept there and it became a major cultural center, featuring dramatic performances as well as art shows. In 1932, it became the Teatre Studium and was later connected to the adjoining buildings. It is now a residence for the nuns of the "Petita Companyia del Cor Eucarístic de Jesús".&lt;ref&gt;[http://barcelofilia.blogspot.com/2011/07/taller-masriera-1884-1932.html Taller Masriera] @ Barcelofília.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a jeweler, he was well known for his use of [[Plique-à-jour]], a notoriously difficult technique. He was also an amateur playwright and a regular contributor to a weekly "magazine", ''El Recuerdo'', created by his brother Josep and his friends, but never actually published.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

[[File:Francesco Casanova Battaglia di cavalleria.jpg|thumb|300px|''Cavalry Battle'', currently in the [[Louvre]]]]
'''Francesco Giuseppe Casanova''' (1 June 1727, London – 8 July 1803, near [[Mödling]]) was an Italian painter who specialised in battle scenes. His older brother was [[Giacomo Casanova]], the famous adventurer, and his younger brother was [[Giovanni Battista Casanova|Giovanni Casanova]]; also a well-known painter.

== Biography ==
[[File:Paysans surpris par un orage.jpg|thumb|275px|left|''The Storm'', one of four "disaster paintings"]]
He was born in London, where his parents, [[Zanetta Farussi]], an actress, and [[Gaetano Casanova]], an actor and dancer, had a theatrical engagement.&lt;ref name="W"&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Casanova,_Francis_(DNB00) "Francis Casanova"] by Lionel Henry Cust, from the ''Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900'', Volume 09 @ Wikisource.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rumoured that his father was actually the Prince of Wales (who shortly after became King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]); whether for scurrilous motives or publicity is unclear.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} They returned to Venice when he was still young and, after his father's death in 1733, he and his siblings were placed in the care of the [[Grimani family]].&lt;ref name="W" /&gt;

His career began in the workshops of [[Giovanni Antonio Guardi]],&lt;ref name="T"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/francesco-giuseppe-casanova_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/ Brief biography] from the Enciclopedia Italiana @ [[Treccani]].&lt;/ref&gt; a very unpleasant time for him, according to the memoirs of his brother Giacomo. Later, he moved to the studios of [[Antonio Joli]], who was a set designer for the theatres owned by the Grimanis. This was also, apparently, unsatisfactory and he took up studies with the battle painter, [[Francesco Simonini]].&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; In 1751, upon his brother Giovanni's advice, he went to Paris and became an apprentice of [[Charles Parrocel]].&lt;ref name="W" /&gt; The following year, after Parrocel's death, he went to Dresden and spent a year studying the battle paintings at the "Gallery of the Electors of Saxony". In 1758, he returned to Paris and set himself up as a free-lance artist.

Success did not come immediately, and his first exhibition was a failure. In 1761, he became a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]] member of the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] and was promoted to full member in 1763.&lt;ref name="T" /&gt; As a result of favourable criticism from [[Denis Diderot]], he began to receive commissions from the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4nQGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=Diderot,+Oeuvres+compl%C3%A8tes.J.+Ass%C3%A9zat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MR5tTrs8KC&amp;sig=K-hIlRxaem9g659UAp0FYaQkrSc&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=Ae1uS_jYK5_kmgO5l7jUBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Diderot on Francesco Casanova, ''Salon'' 1761, in Diderot, ''Beaux-Arts, Essais sur la peinture'', Garnier frères 1879 pp. 149–150] @ Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot would later express negative opinions about Casanova's work, but his reputation was already made.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4nQGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA219&amp;lpg=PA219Beaux-Arts,%20Essais%20sur%20la%20peinture,%20par%20J.%20Ass%E9zat,%20I,%20Paris,%20Garnier%20fr%E8res%201879%20pp.%20149-150&amp;dq=Diderot,+Salon+1763+J.+Ass%E9zat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MR5tTru9IC&amp;sig=LNRWKC9GrZ1u5VhFMb7O3Rv3d8s&amp;hl=it&amp;ei=PvVuS9rdEdOrsAb46MiABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAcQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Diderot on Francesco Casanova, ''Salon'' 1763 in Diderot, ''Beaux-Arts, Essais sur la peinture'', Garnier frères 1879 p. 219] @ Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt; His fame soon spread eastward and he received commissions from [[Catherine the Great]] for the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], beginning in 1768. Two years later, he produced his four famous "disaster paintings", which were purchased by [[Jean-Benjamin de la Borde]] on behalf of King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. In 1771, he exhibited two large canvases depicting scenes from the [[Thirty Years' War]] (The [[Battle of Freiburg]] and the [[Battle of Lens]]) and once again won Diderot's approval.

===Personal life===
[[File:Casanova Cattle on pasture.jpg|thumb|300px|''Cattle on pasture'', [[Łazienki Palace|Palace on the Water]] in [[Warsaw]].]]
In 1762, he had married Jeanne-Marie Jolivet (1734–1773) a ballerina with the theatre of the [[Comédie-Italienne]] who was known as "Mademoiselle d'Alancour". Her professional connections also supplied him with many clients. In 1775, two years after her death, he married the recently widowed Jeanne Cathérine Delachaux (1748–1818). The marriage turned out to be a disaster, so he abandoned her in 1783,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histoireeurope.fr/RechercheLocution.php?Locutions=Jeanne+Catherine+Delachaux Jeanne Delachaux] @ Histoire de l'Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; aided and abetted by Giacomo. He took refuge in Vienna, under the protection of Prince [[Charles-Joseph, 7th Prince of Ligne|Charles Joseph de Ligne]], who introduced him to [[Wenzel Anton, Prince of Kaunitz-Rietberg|Chancellor Kaunitz]]. It appears that Francesco was almost as extroverted and entertaining as his brother Giacomo, so he quickly became popular at the Viennese Court.

In addition to his paintings, he produced designs for [[tapestries]] and upholstery which proved very lucrative. From 1770 to 1787, the [[Beauvais tapestry|Royal Beauvais Manufactory]] used more than seventy of his patterns.

Despite his success and his many aristocratic clients, he squandered his money, was perpetually in debt, and died in poverty at his home near Mödling. The year is generally given as 1803, although some sources have 1805 or 1807.

'''Gary G. Dumm''' (b. c. 1947)&lt;ref name="WhosWho"&gt;[http://www.bailsprojects.com/(S(lkoxi345blthk0e5boqgxf2r))/bio.aspx?Name=DUMM%2c+GARY Dumm entry], Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928–1999.&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Ohio]]-based comic book artist known particularly for his work illustrating the comics of [[Harvey Pekar]]. 

From [[1976 in comics|1976]] until Pekar's 2010 death, he  worked on Pekar's autobiographical comic series, ''[[American Splendor]]'', much of the time as an [[inker]], embellishing the pencils of [[Greg Budgett]] and [[Joe Zabel]], although he also illustrated some stories on his own. (Dumm has also inked Zabel in other venues, including [[Caliber Press|Caliber]]'s ''Dancing With Your Eyes Closed'', [[Fantagraphics]]' ''[[Real Stuff]]'', and Zabel's own title ''The Trespassers''.) 

Dumm was one of Pekar's most frequent and longest-running collaborators on ''American Splendor''; his no-frills style fit the tone of Pekar's tales of quotidian life. Although Dumm's work was characterized by one reviewer as "ham-fisted," whose characters all look "45" years old,&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Ray. ''Ego and Hubris'' review, ''Booklist'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Pekar "had great appreciation for Gary as an artist and as a person. . . . He's also good to work with — he's always on time, and can meet practically any kind of deadline.  He's especially good at working large blocks of text into his work without making it seem text-heavy."&lt;ref name=Zabel&gt;Zabel Joe. "Stepping Out: ST's Joe Zabel Interviews Harvey Pekar," ''Harvey Pekar: Conversations'', edited by Michael G. Rhode (Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Dumm also collaborated with Pekar as the primary artist on two full-length books, ''Ego &amp; Hubris: The [[Michael Malice]] Story'', and ''[[Students for a Democratic Society]]: A Graphic History''.

During the 1980s, Budgett and Dumm worked on stories in ''[[Fredric Wertham|Dr. Wirtham]]'s Comix &amp; Stories'', an [[Underground comix|underground]]/[[alternative comics]] series published by [[Clifford Neal]], as well as a number of other alternative and independent comic book series. In the early 1990s, Budgett and Dumm co-wrote and drew stories for [[Eternity Comics]]' ''Plan 9 From Outer Space: Thirty Years Later'' and their own [[Adult comics|erotic]] series ''Shooty Beagle'' and ''Woofers &amp; Hooters'' (both with [[Eros Comix]]).

Dumm has also worked on such projects as ''Dennis McGee'' and ''The Miracle Squad''. He contributes a regular strip (illustrated bios of [[blues]] people) to the newsletter ''Music Makers Rag''. His editorial cartoons have been published in ''[[Cleveland Scene]]'', ''[[Cleveland Free Times]]'', and ''[[The Plain Dealer]]''. A retrospective of his work was shown at the Artists Archives of the Western Reserve in Cleveland.&lt;ref name="CityPoetry" /&gt; 

Dumm says he feels "itchy" when he’s not drawing.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

== Personal life ==
Dumm married wife Laura, who is also an artist, in 1971. They live on the west side of Cleveland with a "family" of eight rescued stray cats.&lt;ref name="CityPoetry"&gt;[http://www.thecitypoetry.com/issue21/contributors.htm "Contributors,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716225437/http://www.thecitypoetry.com/issue21/contributors.htm |date=2011-07-16 }} ''City Poetry'' #21 (Spring 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; From c. 1971-1983, Dumm worked as the assistant manager of the Cleveland-based Kay's Bookstore.&lt;ref name="WhosWho" /&gt;

== Biography ==
'''Veselkin Igor Petrovich''' was born March 8, 1915, in the town of Ranenburg, Ryazan Governorate.

In 1930 Igor Veselkin entered the Ryazan Art College, from which he graduated in 1934. In 1936 he moved to Leningrad and entered the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]], where he studied under noted educators Alexander Debler, [[Boris Fogel]], Alexander Segal, and Mikhail Platunov.
 
In 1947 Veselkin graduated from the Repin Institute of Arts in Mikhail Bobishov workshop.&lt;ref&gt;''Anniversary Directory graduates of Saint Petersburg State Academic Institute of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture named after Ilya Repin, Russian Academy of Arts. 1915 - 2005''. - Saint Petersburg: Pervotsvet Publishing House, 2007.- p.&amp;nbsp;57.  {{ISBN|978-5-903677-01-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His graduated work was design of the play "The Kremlin chimes" (by the same name play of Nikolai Pogodin), award-winning Art Fund of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;''Artists of the peoples of the USSR. Biography and Bibliography Dictionary. Volume 2''. - Moscow: Iskusstvo Edition, 1972. - p.&amp;nbsp;248.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in the 1947–1951 years, Igor Veselkin had continued his postgraduate studies in the Repin Institute of Arts. In 1951 he was awarded the academic degree of Doctor of art-criticism.

Beginning in 1947, Igor Veselkin worked as a theatre decorator in Leningrad and Moscow theaters for the following plays: "We are on the ground", ([[Olga Bergholz]] and George Makogonenko, Leningrad [[Tovstonogov Bolshoi Drama Theater|BDT Theatre]] named after [[Maxim Gorky]], 1948), "Ilya Golovin" ([[Sergey Mikhalkov]], [[Moscow Art Theatre]] named after Maxim Gorky, 1949), "Philistines" ([[Maxim Gorky]], [[Moscow Art Theatre]], 1950), "[[Summerfolk]]" ([[Maxim Gorky]], [[Moscow Art Theatre]], 1951), "Native Fields" ([[Mariinsky Theatre|Leningrad Opera and Ballet Theatre named after Sergei Kirov]], 1953).
 
From 1946, Igor Veselkin participated in art exhibitions. He painted portraits, landscapes, still lifes, genre paintings, sketches of thearte costumes and set-scenes for Moscow and Leningrad theatres. In 1947 Igor Veselkin was admitted to the [[Leningrad Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists]] (since 1992 known as the Saint Petersburg Union of Artists).&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of members of the Leningrad branch of Union of Artists of Russian Federation.'' - Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1987. - p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
In 1951, Igor Veselkin began teaching painting and drawing, first in the Institute of Applied and Decorative Arts in Moscow, then in Higher School of Insudtrial Art named after Vera Mukhina in Leningrad, and in the Repin Institute of Arts., where he was professor of painting after 1989.

Veselkin Igor Petrovich died in Saint Petersburg in 1997. Paintings by Igor Veselkin reside in State Russian Museum, in art museums and private collections in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' - Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – p.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, France,&lt;ref&gt;''Charmes Russes.

'''James Ward''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Royal Academy|RA]]}} (23 October 1769 &amp;ndash; 17 November 1859) was a painter, particularly of animals, and an engraver.

==Biography==
[[File:James Ward - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Self portrait, 1830]]
[[File:James Ward - Venus Rising from her Couch - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|James Ward - Venus Rising from her Couch -]]
Born in London, and younger brother of [[William Ward (engraver)|William Ward]] the engraver, James Ward was influenced by many people, but his career is conventionally divided into two periods: until 1803, his single greatest influence was his brother in law [[George Morland]]; from that time, it was [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]. From 1810 or so, Ward started to paint horses within landscapes; slightly later, he turned to very large-scale landscapes, of which ''Gordale Scar'' ([[Tate]], [[London]]), completed in 1814 or 1815 and depicting [[Gordale Scar]] ([[Yorkshire]]) as an example of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], is considered his masterpiece and a masterpiece of [[England|English]] [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[painting]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[File:James Ward - Gordale Scar (A View of Gordale, in the Manor of East Malham in Craven, Yorkshire, the Property of Lord Ribblesdale) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Gordale Scar'']]
Ward devoted much of the period 1815-21 to the painting of a gigantic work titled ''[[Allegory of Waterloo]]'' (now lost); this neither was much praised nor brought in the revenue Ward had hoped for. The experience may have embittered him, and the deaths of his first wife and a daughter were among other tragedies. Like many artists of the time, Ward sought commissions from wealthy gentry of their favorite horses, their favorite hunting dogs or their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C78CAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=%22cock-shooting%22+levett&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=X8GDyUdv_z&amp;sig=ZFfopLXl5t2yR1D_f1aXDNYgPFo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LY-PSu-3C4TOsgP3sZwH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cock-shooting%22%20levett&amp;f=false |title=The Sporting Magazine, or Monthly Calendar of the Transactions of The Turf and The Chase and Every Other Diversion Interesting to the Man of Pleasure Enterprise &amp; Spirit, Vol. 19, New Series, Printed for J.

One such family that Ward painted and drew repeatedly, and whom he counted among his friends, were the [[Levett]] family of [[Wychnor Hall|Wynchnor Park]], [[Staffordshire]]. One of Ward's best-known portraits was his ''Theophilus Levett hunting at Wychnor, Staffordshire'' of 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06EFD9103DF933A05754C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=The New York Times, Grace Glueck, July 30, 2004 |publisher=New York Times |date=2004-07-30 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was Ward's 1811  painting entitled ''The Reverend Thomas Levett and his favourite dogs, cock-shooting''.
Ward also painted a group portrait of three Levett children — John, Theophilus and Frances Levett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=4020490 |title=Group Portrait of John, Theophilus and Frances Levett, James Ward, November 1811, Christie's |publisher=Christies.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For the Levetts, see link to the Ward exhibit at the Yale Center for British Art.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=%22theophilus+levett%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=DCbobeeDc2&amp;sig=k4RfM7v3YYOdWwCnqlfXevFthO4&amp;hl=en#PPA232,M1 |title=Animal Painters of England from the Year 1650, Walter Gilbey, 1900 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
&lt;!-- [[File:Ward, James — Horse (painting).jpg|thumbnail|left|File:Ward, James — Horse (painting).jpg]] --&gt;
James was the son of James and Rachael Ward. He was first married to Mary Ann Ward (no known relation) in 1794 and after her death to Charlotte Fritche in 1827 (supposedly a relative of his first wife).
James and Mary Ann Ward had several children including:
#Matilda Louisa Ward, who married the artist John Jackson.
#George Raphael Ward, b. 1798, d. 1879  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/n/i/s/Patrick-T-Nisbett/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0154.html |title=Patrick T Nisbett |publisher=Familytreemaker.genealogy.com |date=1996-08-15 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Ward was the paternal grandfather of the painter [[Henrietta Ward]] and the great-grandfather of [[Leslie Ward]], the ''Vanity Fair'' caricaturist.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1830, Ward moved to [[Cheshunt]] ([[Hertfordshire]]) with his second wife, but he continued to work, particularly on religious themes. A stroke in 1855 ended his work, and he died in poverty. He is buried at [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Paths&gt;{{cite book|title=Paths of Glory|date=1997|publisher=Friends of Kensal Green Cemetery|page=103|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:The_Deer_Stealer_by_James_Ward.jpeg|thumb|left|The Deer Stealer]]
James Ward was one of the outstanding artists of the day, his singular style and great skill set him above most of his contemporaries, markedly influencing the growth of British art. Regarded as one of the great animal painters of his time, James produced history paintings, portraits, landscapes and genre. He started off as an engraver, trained by William, who later engraved much of his work. The partnership of William and James Ward produced the best that English art had to offer, their great technical skill and artistry having led to images that reflect the grace and charm of the era. He was admitted for membership into the [[Royal Academy]] in 1811.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/30/arts/art-review-dashing-world-of-animals-as-regal-as-their-owners.html?pagewanted=all |title=Art Review: Dashing World of Animals as Regal as Their Owners, Grace Glueck, The New York Times, July 30, 2004 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2004-07-30 |accessdate=2012-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Ward's best-known paintings,''The Deer Stealer'', was commissioned in 1823 for the sum of 500 guineas by Ward's patron Theophilus Levett. When the work was finished, Levett pronounced himself delighted with the results, and consequently raised the remuneration to 600 guineas. Subsequently, Ward was said to have been offered 1,000 guineas for the painting by 'a nobleman,' which he declined. The painting now hangs at [[Tate]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159447975 A Great British Collection, sothebys.com]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chamangá Rock Art Place''' ({{lang-es|'''Localidad Rupestre de Chamangá'''}}) is a concentration of [[rock painting]] located at [[Chamangá]] to the east of [[Trinidad, Uruguay]]. 
&lt;!-- == Generalidades ==
Se trata de una extensión de más de 12.000 hectáreas caracterizadas por un relieve suavemente ondulado y ecosistemas de praderas -con suelos de alta fertilidad dedicados a la explotación agrícola ganadera extensiva- con montes asociados a los arroyos [[arroyo Chamangá|Chamangá]] y [[arroyo Los Molles|Los Molles]] y con algunos [[bañado]]s.

Presenta la mayor concentración de [[pictografías rupestres]] del Uruguay, cuya singularidad está dada por su emplazamiento en campos abiertos y sobre afloramientos [[graníticos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cita web |url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/322598-chamanga-pinturas-rupestres-de-flores-son-propuestas-como-area-protegida |título=Chamangá propuesta como área protegida |fechaacceso=22 de abril |añoacceso=2012 |apellido= |nombre= |fecha=31-7-2008 |obra=LR21 |idioma= |cita= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Se trata de 43 pictografías rupestres caracterizadas por sus trazos y formas geométricas abstractas y son de color rojo por la base mineral del pigmento, la [[hematita]]. El Centro de Investigación del Arte Rupestre en Uruguay las ha analizado: se trata de impresiones de palma de mano en positivo, tanto adultas como juveniles; trazos de grosor digital; trazos realizados con pincel fino de dos tipos, rígido y flexible; y "grabado fino", incisión realizada con instrumento cortante agudo, se da en su tipo geométrico irregular "destructivo".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flores.org.uy/cultura/arterupe.htm CIARU]&lt;/ref&gt; Estas pinturas presentan relación con una tendencia estilística muy desarrollada en la [[Patagonia]] andina y no andina, que abarca también la región pampeana, y se asemejan al 'estilo grecas' o simétrico complejo. Es un estilo de pintura, básicamente, en rojo, siempre con diseños de tipo geométrico abstracto, sumamente difundido. La antiguedad es entre los 1.000 a 1.500 años antes del presente;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uypress.net/uc_2740_1.html Análisis de las pinturas rupestres de Chamangá]&lt;/ref&gt; si bien hay quienes, como el Lic. Andrés Florines, les atribuyen una antigüedad de hasta 3.000 años.

'''''Maganda pa ang Daigdig''''' (officially translated as "The World Be Lovely Still"; the literal translation is "The World is Still Beautiful") is a [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]-language novel written by [[Filipino people|Filipino]] novelist [[Lázaro Francisco]].&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;

==Plot==
The novel is about Lino Rivera, a gardener, who lost faith in an "oppressive social system" in the [[Philippines]].  Lino was accused of committing robbery and homicide.  Lino escapes from prison to live a life of a fugitive.  He defended an “enlightened landlord” against the [[Hukbalahap]] of [[Central Luzon]] and against former [[guerrilla]]s who were active during the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]].  Convinced by Colonel Roda, Padre Amando, among other "kindhearted people", Lino comes down from the mountain, turning his back from living the life of a fugitive.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;

==Description==
The novel was first appeared as a serial in 1955 on the pages of ''[[Liwayway]]'' magazine.  It was first published in book form by the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] Press in 1982.&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt;&lt;ref name=GB&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R1eHL4RPwAAC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title= Maganda pa ang daigdig by Lázaro Francisco, Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1982 - 362 pages|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 362-page novel&lt;ref name=GB/&gt; was republished in 1989.  In 1992, the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) chose ''Maganda pa ang Daigdig'' as a less known literary work authored by a Filipino writer that has "high artistic merit" and "worthy of translation to introduce to an international readership".&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=19216&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title= Maganda Pa Ang Daigdig by Lazaro Francisco (1898-1980), Literature &amp; Translation|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Military art''' is art with a [[military]] subject matter, regardless of its style or medium.  The battle scene is one of the oldest types of art in developed civilizations, as rulers have always been keen to celebrate their victories and intimidate potential opponents. The depiction of other aspects of warfare, especially the suffering of casualties and civilians, has taken much longer to develop.  As well as portraits of military figures, depictions of anonymous soldiers away from the battlefield have been very common; since the introduction of [[military uniform]]s such works often concentrate on showing the variety of these.

Naval scenes are very common, and battle scenes and "ship portraits" are mostly considered as a branch of [[marine art]]; the development of other large types of military equipment such as [[warplane]]s and [[tank]]s has led to new types of work portraying these, either in action or at rest.  In 20th century wars official [[war artist]]s were retained to depict the military in action; despite artists now being very close to the action the battle scene is mostly left to popular graphic media and the cinema.  The term war art is sometimes used, mostly in relation to 20th century military art made during wartime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/war-art "War art"] in the ''Oxford Companion to Military History'', on Answers.com, and the article by Richard Woodward on "Military artists" in the same work ([http://www.answers.com/topic/military-artists penultimate paragraph]); note that the term does not appear at all in [[Grove Art Online]], or other large art reference works. As formal "wars" have largely vanished, "combat artist" seems to be replacing "war artist" in official use.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient world===
[[File:Alexandermosaic.jpg|thumb|The Roman [[Alexander Mosaic]] showing [[Alexander the Great]] (left) defeating [[Darius III of Persia]]; a floor mosaic excavated from [[Pompeii]], c. 100BC]]

Art depicting military themes has existed throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Battlefield Palette]], a [[cosmetic palette]] from the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt]] (circa [[3500 BC|~3500]] to [[3000 BC]]) is incomplete, but shows prisoners being led away, and wild animals feasting on the dead. The [[Stele of the Vultures]], about 2,500 BC, is one of a number of [[Mesopotamian]] "victory [[stelae]]".  Also around 2,500 BC, the earliest known depiction of a city being besieged is found in the tomb of Inti, an official from the [[Nome (Egypt)#Upper Egypt|21st nome of Upper Egypt]], who lived during the late Fifth Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Strudwick (2005), p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The scene shows Egyptian soldiers scaling the walls of a near eastern fortress on ladders.&lt;ref&gt;Baker (2008), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the [[Battle of Kadesh]] in 1274 BC appears to have been inconclusive, reliefs erected by [[Ramesses II]] show him scattering his [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]] opponents with his chariot.

Surviving [[Assyrian art]] mainly consists of large stone [[relief]]s showing detailed scenes of either military campaigns or hunting.  The ancient Greek [[Parthenon Marbles]] show lengthy parades of the city's volunteer [[cavalry]] force, and many [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]] show scenes of combat.  In [[Han dynasty]] China, a famous stone relief of c. 150-170 AD from the [[Wu family shrines]] shows a battle between cavalry forces in the [[Campaign against Dong Zhuo]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Ancient Roman art]] the most elaborate [[Roman triumphal column]]s showed very long reliefs of military campaigns winding round the body of huge columns; among the most impressive are those of [[Trajan's Column|Trajan]] and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius]] in Rome.  The [[Alexander Mosaic]] is a large and dramatic battle scene showing [[Alexander the Great]] defeating [[Darius III of Persia]]; it is a floor mosaic excavated from [[Pompeii]], probably copying a lost painting.&lt;ref name="Military Artists"&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/military-artists "Military Artists"] in the ''Oxford Companion to Military History'', on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[Hellenistic]] and Roman [[sarcophagi]] showed crowded scenes of combat, sometimes mythological (an [[amazonomachy]] is a term for a scene of battle between [[Amazons]] and [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]]), and usually not relating to a particular battle; these were not necessarily used to bury people with military experience.  Such scenes had a great influence on Renaissance battle scenes.&lt;ref name="Pepper, 1 i"&gt;Pepper, 1 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;  By the Late Roman Empire the reverse of coins very often showed soldiers and carried an inscription praising 'our boys', no doubt in hope of delaying the next military revolt.

===Medieval===
{{wide image|Tapisserie de Bayeux 31109.jpg|20000px|The entire 70 metres (230 ft) long [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. Individual images of each scene are at [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli]]. (Swipe left or right.)|30%|right|}}

Christian art produced for the church generally avoided battle scenes, although a rare [[Late Antique]] motif shows Christ dressed as a victorious emperor in general's dress, having conquered the devil, in [[Christ treading on the beasts]] and other [[iconography|iconographies]].  The violent tastes of the [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] elite managed to add the [[Harrowing of Hell]], conceived as a raid on Satan's stronghold, led by Christ, to the standard group of scenes for a cycle on the ''[[Life of Christ]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 153&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soldier saints]], shown in military dress, were extremely popular, as were images of the [[Archangel Michael]] stabbing Satan as a dragon with a cross with a spear-point at its base.  Some [[illuminated manuscript]]s illustrated the many battles in the [[Old Testament]].

Secular works produced for secular patrons often show military themes, for example in illuminated manuscript copies of histories like the 15th century [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)]], where most of the 112 miniatures show military scenes.  The ''[[Siege of the Castle of Love]]'', often found on Gothic [[ivory]] mirror-cases, showed knights attacking a castle defended by ladies, a metaphor from the literature of [[courtly love]].  The 11th century [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is a linear panoramic narrative of the events surrounding the [[Norman Conquest]] and the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22470&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65Xnib8Hg?url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/homepage/ |date=2012-02-18 }}, Bayeaux tapestry, [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151214212044/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22472&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Nomination Form, p. 4]; excerpt,"... it is an established fact that it recounts a military triumph: the conquest of England by William the Conqueror"; [https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20151214212044/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22472&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Nomination Form], pp. 5-6; excerpt, "This large-scale textile work of the 11th century is, to our knowledge, the only one of its kind to have survived to the present day. The Tapestry is an almost contemporary visual record of the event it depicts, one of the most significant events of Medieval times. It tells of the beginnings of the Norman Conquest; the landing of Norman and French troops in England and the Battle of Hastings"&lt;/ref&gt; the only surviving example of a type of embroidered hanging with which rich [[Anglo-Saxons]] used to decorate their homes.  In [[Islamic art]] the battle scene, often from a fictional work of [[epic poetry]], was a frequent subject in [[Persian miniature]]s, and the high viewpoint they adopted made the scenes more easily comprehensible than many Western images.

===Renaissance to Napoleonic Wars===
[[File:Urs Graf Schrecken des Kriegs 1521.jpg|thumb|left|After the [[Battle of Marignano]], drawing by [[Urs Graf]], 1521]]

[[Italian Renaissance painting]] saw a great increase in military art by the leading artists, '''battle paintings''' often featuring near-contemporary scenes such as the huge set of three canvases of  ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1445) by [[Paolo Uccello]], and the abortive ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|Battle of Cascina]]'' (1504–06) by Michelangelo and ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1503–06), which were intended to be placed opposite each other in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]], but neither of which were completed.  For Renaissance artists with their new skills in depicting the human figure, battle scenes allowed them to demonstrate all their skills in depicting complicated poses; Michelangelo choose a moment when a group of soldiers was surprised bathing, and almost all the figures are nude.  Leonardo's battle was a cavalry one, the central section of which was very widely seen before being destroyed, and hugely influential: it "exerted a fundamental change on the whole idea of battle painting, an influence that lasted through the Late Renaissance and the Baroque up until the heroic machines of the Napoleonic painters and even the battle compositions of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]]", according to the art historian [[Frederick Hartt]].&lt;ref&gt;Hartt, 457 on Leonardo (quoted), 470-471 on Michelangelo, 246-248 on Uccello.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these depicted frankly minor actions where Florence had defeated neighbouring cities, but important battles from distant history were equally popular. [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Triumphs of Caesar]]'' shows the [[Roman triumph]]al parade of [[Julius Caesar]], though concentrating on the booty rather than the army following it; the print series ''[[Triumphs of Maximilian]]'' shows both, leading up to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]] riding on a huge carriage. ''[[The Battle of the Milvian Bridge (Giulio Romano)|The Battle of the Milvian Bridge]]'' by [[Giulio Romano]] brought a huge and "seminal" battle scene into the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]].&lt;ref name="Pepper, 1 i"/&gt;  The unusual ''[[The Battle of Alexander at Issus]]'' (1528–9) by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] managed to make one of the most highly regarded Renaissance battle scenes, despite, or perhaps because of, having a vertical format, which was dictated by the planned setting; it was commissioned as one of a set of eight battle paintings by various artists. "It was the most detailed and panoramic battle picture of its day",&lt;ref name="Military Artists"/&gt;  and its aerial viewpoint was to be very widely followed over the next centuries, though rarely to such dramatic effect.
[[Image:Vroom Hendrick Cornelisz Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602.jpg|thumb|''Dutch Ships Ramming Spanish Galleys off the Flemish Coast in October 1602'', 1617, by [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom|Hendrick Vroom]]]]

Especially in Northern Europe, small groups of soldiers became a popular subject for paintings and especially [[old master print|prints]] by many artists, including [[Urs Graf]], who is unusual in that he was a professional [[Swiss mercenary]] for many years.  These works began to present a less heroic view of soldiers, who often represented a considerable threat to civilian populations even in peacetime, though the extravagant costumes of the [[Landsknecht]] are often treated as glamorous.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 1 (iii), Kettering, 104&lt;/ref&gt;  For Peter Paret, from the Renaissance "the glorification of the temporal leader and of his political system - which had of course also been present in medieval art - replaces the Christian faith as a determining interpretive force" in military art.&lt;ref&gt;Paret, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval painting became conventionalized in 17th century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], and from then on artists tended to specialize in it or not attempt it; apart from anything else "Marine artists have always dealt with a particularly demanding class of patron", as [[JMW Turner]] found when the "Sailor King" [[William IV of England]] rejected his version of ''[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|The Battle of Trafalgar]]'' because of inaccuracy. [[Hendrick Cornelisz Vroom|Hendrick Vroom]] was the earliest real specialist,  followed by the [[Willem van de Velde the Elder|father]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger|son team of Willem van de Velde]], who emigrated to London in 1673, and effectively founded the English tradition of naval painting, "producing a stunning visual record of the Anglo-Dutch naval wars, which set the conventions of maritime battle painting for the next 150 years".  Vroom had also worked for English patrons, designing a large set of tapestries of the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] which was destroyed when the [[Houses of Parliament]] burnt down in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 3 (i) quoted on patrons; 2 (ii) quoted on van de Veldes; Slive, Chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 17th and 18th centuries saw depictions of battles mostly adopting a [[bird's eye view]], as though from a hill nearby; this made them less interesting to paint, and the major artists now tended to avoid them. A very different view of warfare is seen in ''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]'' ("The Misfortunes of War"), a set of twelve [[etching]]s produced by [[Jacques Callot]] during the [[Thirty Years War]] which follows a group of soldiers ravaging the countryside before eventually being rounded up by their own side and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Becker, 155-156; [http://www.answers.com/topic/military-artists "Military Artists"] in the ''Oxford Companion to Military History'', on Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in the first half of the 17th century, a branch of [[genre painting]] in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] specialized in [[guardroom scene]]s of rather disorderly soldiers, not often in battle, but ransacking farmhouses or sitting around in a camp guardroom.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 2 (i); Kettering, 104-109&lt;/ref&gt;  The paintings of [[Salvator Rosa]], essentially [[landscape art|landscapes]], often showed groups variously described as bandits or soldiers lurking in the countryside of Southern Italy.  ''[[The Surrender of Breda]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] (1634–35) shows a crowded scene as the two sides meet peacefully to surrender the town; a theme more often copied in naval painting than land-based military art.&lt;ref name="Military Artists"/&gt;
[[File:John Singleton Copley 001.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Death of Major Peirson]]'', 1784, by [[John Singleton Copley]]]]

During the 17th century sets of [[tapestries]] became the main medium for "official military art".  A set produced for the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] showing his victories was varied for different clients, and even sold to one of his opponents, [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]], after reworking the general's faces and other details.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 2 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishbattles.com/spanish-succession/battle-blenheim.htm 1704 Battle of Blenheim depicted in tapestry at Blenheim Palace]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-18th century, a number of artists, especially in Britain, sought to revive military art with large works centred on a heroic incident that would once again bring the genre to the fore in [[history painting]], as it had been in the Renaissance.  The standard contemporary battle scene tended to be grouped in the lowly category of [[topographical painting]], covering maps and views of country houses.  ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1771) by [[Benjamin West]], ''[[The Death of Captain James Cook (Zoffany)|The Death of Captain James Cook]]'' (1779) by [[Johann Zoffany]], ''[[The Defeat of the Floating Batteries at Gibraltar, September 1782]]'' and  ''[[The Death of Major Pierson]]'' (1784) by [[John Singleton Copley]] are leading examples of the new type, which ignored complaints about the unsuitability of modern dress for heroic subjects.  However such works had more immediate influence in France than in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:An Officer of the Imperial Horse Guards Charging.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The Charging Chasseur]] by [[Théodore Géricault|Géricault]].]]

In the [[Napoleonic era]], France added [[Romanticism]] to its style and began to portray individual soldiers with more character.  Battle paintings were increasingly produced for large public buildings, and grew larger than ever before. [[Antoine-Jean Gros|Baron Gros]] painted mostly glorifications of Napoleon and his victories, but his 1808 painting of the ''[[Battle of Eylau]]'' does not neglect the suffering of the dead and wounded on the frozen battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Geraldine. (1977). "Gros, Baron Antoine Jean", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|''Nineteenth-century Painters and Painting: A Dictionary'', p. 100.|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Goya]]'s large paintings ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' and ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'', perhaps consciously conceived as a riposte to Gros, and his related series of 82 [[etching]]s, ''[[The Disasters of War]]'' (Spanish: ''Los Desastres de la Guerra''), emphasized the brutality of the French forces during the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 3 (ii); Honour &amp; Fleming, 483&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Goya y Lucientes, Franciso José de", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 99.|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  British depictions of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] continued the late 18th century patterns, often on a larger scale, with the death of Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] quickly producing large works by [[Arthur William Devis]] (''[[The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805]]'') and West (''[[The Death of Nelson (West painting)|The Death of Nelson]]''). [[J. M. W. Turner]] was among the artists who produced scenes of Nelson's victories, with ''[[The Battle of Trafalgar (painting)|The Battle of Trafalgar]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, 3 (i)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Institution]] ran competitions for sketches of art commemorating British victories, the winning entries being then commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, 14-28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grande Armée - 10th Regiment of Hussars.jpg|thumb|upright|left|10th Regiment of Hussars, by Carle Vernet]]
In this period the uniform print, concentrating on a detailed depiction of the uniform of one or more standing figures, typically hand-coloured, also became very popular across Europe. Like other prints these were typically published in book form, but also sold individually.  In Britain the 87 prints of ''The Loyal Volunteers of London'' (1797–98) by [[Thomas Rowlandson]], published by [[Rudolph Ackermann]], mark the start of the classic period.  Though Rowlandson usually satirized his subjects to some degree, here the soldiers were "represented as they, and particularly their colonels who paid for their uniforms, preferred to see themselves", which remained the usual depiction in such prints.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 73-74, quoting Ford's history of the Ackermann firm.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[commons:Category:La Grande Armée (Carle Vernet)|set of prints]] by [[Carle Vernet]] of the splendid uniforms of ''La [[Grande Armée]] de 1812'' showed most foot-soldiers in pairs in camp, in a variety of relaxed poses that showed one from the front and the other from behind.  A rare oil painting by a leading artist that treats soldiers in the spirit of the uniform print is ''Soldiers of the 10th Light Dragoons'' (the "Prince of Wales Own") painted in 1793 by [[George Stubbs]] for their [[Colonel in Chief]], the future [[George IV of England]].  Other paintings of single soldiers were more dramatic, like [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Charging Chasseur]]'' (c. 1812).

===Nineteenth century===
[[File:Than tapiobicskei utközet2 1849 aprilis 4.jpg|thumb|left|Battle scene at [[Tápióbicske]] by [[Mór Than]], 1849]]

[[Eugène Delacroix]], who also painted many smaller combat scenes, finished his ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' in 1824, showing a then notorious attack on Greek civilians by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces during the [[Greek War of Independence]], who are shown in an entirely negative light.  It had a more immediate impact on European art than Goya's ''Tres de Mayo'' (''The Third of May 1808'') of a few years earlier, which was apparently not even on display in the [[Prado Museum]] until some years later.  In contrast, Delacroix's ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' of 1830 showed fighting in a positive light, but not the "military" as it shows armed civilian revolutionaries of the [[July Revolution]], advancing against the unseen uniformed forces of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, 487-488&lt;/ref&gt;  Turkish atrocities were to remain a recurrent theme in 19th-century painting, especially in former Ottoman territories escaped from the declining empire (often pre-rape scenes treated rather salaciously), and general anti-military sentiments, previously mostly found in prints, were also to emerge regularly in large oil paintings.

Military art remained popular during the remainder of the 19th century in most of Europe. French artists such as [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Ernest Meissonier]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Messonier, Jean Louis Ernest", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 145.|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edouard Detaille]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Detaille, Jean Baptiste Edouard", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 73.|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville|Alphonse de Neuville]]&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Neuville, Alphonse Marie de", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 159.|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; established military genre painting in the [[Paris Salon]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, A.E. (1958). "Military Art and Artists", ''Army Quarterly and Defence Journal'', Vol. 76-77, pp. 235-236; excerpt, "A collaborator of [[Edouard Detaille|Detaille]], and like him a specialist in military art, was [[Alphonse-Marie-Adolphe de Neuville|Alphonse de Neuville]] (1836&amp;ndash;1885), who made his debut at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1859 with a scene showing a French battery at [[Sevastopol|Sebastapol]]."&lt;/ref&gt; New forms of military art which developed in the 1850s met considerable opposition from the [[Royal Academy]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ|pp. 58.|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan Matejko, Bitwa pod Grunwaldem.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''[[Battle of Grunwald]]'' by [[Jan Matejko]], 1878]]
European artists in a generally [[Academic art|academic style]] who were well known as painters of battle scenes, still often of subjects from the Napoleonic Wars or older conflicts, included [[Albrecht Adam]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Albrecht, Adam", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 28.|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicaise de Keyser]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Keyser, Nicaise de", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 120.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piotr Michałowski]]&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Michalowski, Piotr", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 120.|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Charles Horace Vernet]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Vernet, Antoine Charles Horace", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 211.|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emile Jean Horace Vernet]],&lt;ref&gt;Norman, "Vernet, Emile Jean Horace", {{Google books|G_AIX2wVuj0C|p. 212.|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Camphausen]] and [[Emil Hünten]].  The rise of [[nationalism]] promoted battle painting in countries such as Hungary (great attention paid to uniforms), Poland (huge forces) and the [[Czech Lands]]. [[Jan Matejko]]'s enormous ''[[Battle of Grunwald (painting)|Battle of Grunwald]]'' (1878) reflects [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slav]] sentiment, showing various [[Slav]] forces joining together to smash the power of the [[Teutonic Knights]].

The usage of the term "military art" has evolved since the middle of the 19th century.  In France, Charles Baudelaire discussed military art, and the impact on it of photography, in the Paris [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Paret, Peter (1997). {{Google books|iCyO0uVEzRUC|''Imagined Battles. Reflections of War in European Art'', p. 85.|page=85}}, citing [[Charles Baudelaire]]. (1992). "The [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1859", ''Selected Writings on Art and Literature'', trans. P. E. Charvet, pp. 295, 297; excerpt, "In a section preceding the discussion of ''military art'' in his articles on the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1859, Baudelaire discussed the advent of photography and its impact on art."&lt;/ref&gt;  A British critic of the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition of 1861 observed that 
{{cquote|British painters have never fully grappled with ''military art'', they have only hovered around the edges, touching and trimming. -- [[William Michael Rossetti]]&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ| pp. 68-69.|page=68}}; the term ''military art'' is &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; a [[neologism]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Chesmabattle.jpg|thumb|upright=.9|left|[[Battle of Chesma]] by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], 1848]]
In contrast, the British artist [[Elizabeth Thompson]] (Lady Butler) explained that she "never painted for the glory of war, but to portray its pathos and heroism."&lt;ref&gt;Mcintyre, Ben. September 10, 2009
[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article6828145.ece  "Pictures of war can carry more moral meaning than thousands of words,"] ''The Times'' (London). September 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The aftermath of battle was depicted in paintings like ''Calling the Roll After An Engagement, Crimea'', which displayed at the Royal Academy in 1874.  This perspective is also seen in ''[[Remnants of an Army]]'' which showed William Brydon struggling into Jalalabad on a dying horse. Dr.  Brydon was the sole survivor of the 1842 retreat from Kabul, in which 16,000 were massacred by Afghan tribesmen.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/ben_macintyre/article6828145.ece  "Pictures,"] September 10, 2009;  [http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1842-04-07-05-001&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1842-04-07-05  "The Disasters in Afghanistan,"] ''The Times.''

The British market began to develop in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ| p. 71.|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relations between the state and its military, and the ideologies which are implied in that relationship affected the artwork, the artists and the public perceptions of both artwork and artists.&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, {{Google books|h_C8AAAAIAAJ|p. 2-3.|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Crimean War]] photographers began to compete strongly with artists in coverage of scenes in camp, and the aftermath of battle, but exposure times were generally too long to enable them to take pictures of battles very effectively. [[War photography]] is not covered in this article.  Illustrations for newspapers and magazines continued a heroic style with perhaps more confidence than painters, and [[Melton Prior]] followed British forces around Imperial troublespots for decades, working for the ''[[Illustrated London News]]''; his scenes "helped to establish a style of action draughtsmanship which has left an indelible stamp on the art of the [[comic strip]]."&lt;ref name="Pepper, 3, ii"&gt;Pepper, 3, (ii)&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior and other "special correspondents" such as [[Frederic Villiers]] were known as "specials". [[Richard Caton Woodville]] and [[Charles Edwin Fripp]] were "specials" and also painters who exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Pepper, 3, ii"/&gt;

===Twentieth century===
[[File:'Stormtroops Advancing Under Gas', etching and aquatint by Otto Dix, 1924.jpg|thumb|''[[Stormtrooper]]s Advancing Under Gas'', etching and aquatint by [[Otto Dix]] from ''Der Krieg'', 1924]]
World War I very largely confirmed the end of the glorification of war in art, which had been in decline since the end of the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, Introduction and 3, ii&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, and despite the establishment of large schemes employing official [[war artist]]s, the most striking art depicting the war is that emphasizing its horror. Official war artists were appointed by governments for information or propaganda purposes and to record events on the battlefield;&lt;ref&gt;[[The National Archives|National Archives (UK)]], [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/theartofwar/inf3.htm  "'The Art of War,' Learn About the Art."]&lt;/ref&gt; but many artists fought as normal soldiers and recorded their experiences at the time and later, including the Germans [[George Grosz]] and [[Otto Dix]], who had both fought on the Western Front, and continued to depict the subject for the rest of their careers. Dix's ''[[The Trench (Dix)|The Trench]]'' (1923), showing the dismembered bodies of the dead after an assault, caused a scandal, and was first displayed behind a curtain, before causing the dismissal of the museum director who had planned to buy it.  Later, after exhibiting it in their 1937 travelling exhibition of "[[Degenerate art]]", the [[Nazi]] government burnt it.  He produced a set of fifty prints in 1924 on ''Der Krieg'' ("The War").  The English artist [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] began to make drawings of the war while fighting on the Western Front in the [[Artists Rifles]].  After recovering from a wound he was recruited as an official war artist and produced many of the most memorable images from the British side of both World Wars.  After the war, the huge demand for [[war memorial]]s caused a boom for sculptors, covered below, and makers of [[stained-glass]].

[[Poster]]s had become universal by 1914 and were addressed at both the military and the "home front" for various purposes, including recruitment, where the British ''[[Lord Kitchener Wants You]]'' (not actually the slogan) was repeated in the United States with [[Uncle Sam]], and elsewhere with similar totemic figures.  The Soviet Union began with very [[Modernist]] posters such as ''[[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge]]'' by [[Lazar Markovich Lissitzky]] but soon turned to [[socialist realism]], used for most [[World War II posters from the Soviet Union]], which sometimes are similar to their [[Art of the Third Reich|Nazi equivalents]].  In World War II they were even more widely used.&lt;ref&gt;James covers all major combatant nations of World War I; for British World War II posters, and a wider bibliography, see ''Weapons on the Wall'' in external links&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrators and sketch artists such as Norman Rockwell also followed the trend away from military themed shots following the Second World War and with the rise of photographic covers in general.

The impact of the [[Spanish Civil War]] on a non-combatant populace was depicted in [[Picasso]]'s masterpiece, [[Guernica (painting)|''Guernica'']], showing the [[bombing of Guernica]] in 1937;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, William. [http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0209-04.htm The Lessons of Guernica,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204012027/http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0209-04.htm |date=2010-12-04 }} ''Toronto Star.'' February 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; a very different treatment of a similar subject is seen in [[Henry Moore]]'s drawings of sleeping civilians sheltering from [[The Blitz]] bombing on the station platforms of the [[London Underground]]. Among official World War II war artists, Paul Nash's ''[[Totes Meer]]'' is a powerful image of a scrapyard of shot-down German aircraft, and the landscapist [[Eric Ravilious]] produced some very fine paintings before being shot down and killed in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 66&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Ardizzone]]'s pictures concentrated entirely on soldiers relaxing or performing routine duties, and were praised by many soldiers: "He is the only person who has caught the atmosphere of this war" felt [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]], the art critic and historian, friend of Picasso, and then in a military medical unit.&lt;ref&gt;Foss, 123&lt;/ref&gt;  Photography and film were now able to capture fast-moving action, and can fairly be said to have produced most of memorable images recording combat in the war, and certainly subsequent conflicts like the [[Vietnam War]], which was more notable for specifically anti-war protest art, in posters and the work of artists like [[Nancy Spero]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, 77-83&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art forms==

===Portraiture===
[[File:Bartholomeus van der Helst, Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|''[[Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration of the Peace of Münster|Banquet of the Amsterdam Civic Guard in Celebration]] of the [[Peace of Münster]]'', 1648, by [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]], 232 × 547 cm (91.34 × 215.35 in)]]
Rulers have been shown in specifically military dress since ancient times; the difference is especially easy to see in [[Ancient Roman sculpture]], where generals and increasingly often emperors are depicted with armour and the short military tunic.  Medieval [[tomb effigies]] more often than not depict knights, nobles and kings in armour, whether or not they saw active service.  In the [[Early Modern period]], when senior commanders tended to wear their normal riding dress even on the battlefield, the distinction between a military portrait and a normal one is mostly conveyed by the background, or by a breastplate or the buff leather jerkin worn underneath armour, but once even generals began to wear military uniform, in the mid-18th century, it becomes clear again,&lt;ref&gt;Kettering, 100&lt;/ref&gt; although initially officer's uniforms were close to smart civilian costume.

Full-length and equestrian portraits of rulers and [[general officer|generals]] often showed them on the battlefield, but with the action in the distant background; a feature probably dating back to [[Titian]]'s magisterial ''[[Equestrian Portrait of Charles V]]'', which shows the emperor after his victory at the [[Battle of Mühlberg]] but with no other soldiers present.  Monarchs were not often painted in military uniform until the Napoleonic period, but in the 19th century this became typical for formal portraits, perhaps because uniform was more visually appealing. A distinctively Dutch type of painting are huge group portraits commissioned by the wealthy part-time officers of city militia companies, of which [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' is much the most famous, although its narrative setting is atypical of the genre.  Most examples just show the officers lined up as though about to eat dinner, and some show them actually eating it.&lt;ref&gt;Slive, 250-251&lt;/ref&gt;  Otherwise group portraits of officers are rather surprisingly rare until the 19th century.

===Sculpture===
[[File:Jagger artillery memorial1.jpg|thumb|right|One of the figures on the [[Royal Artillery Memorial]] in London, by [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]]]] 
[[File:Fischerskulptur aus Stgw 57 IMG 1477.JPG|thumb|right|Sculpture made from Swiss assault rifles [[SIG SG 510|Stgw 57]]]]
Most surviving sculpture of battle scenes from antiquity is in stone reliefs, covered above.  Renaissance artists and patrons were keen to revive this form, which they mostly did in much smaller scenes in stone or bronze.  The tomb in [[Milan]] of the brilliant French general [[Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours]] included numerous marble reliefs round the base of the sarcophagus (which was never completed).  Statues and tomb monuments of commanders continued to be the most common site until the more general [[war memorial]] commemorating all the dead began to emerge in the period of the Napoleonic Wars. [[Nelson's Column]] in London still commemorates a single commander; it has very large reliefs around the base by different artists, although these are generally regarded as less memorable than other aspects of the monument. [[Wellington's Column]] in [[Liverpool]] is also known as the "Waterloo Memorial", shifting to the more modern concept when "the dead were remembered essentially as soldiers who fought in the name of national collectives".&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The huge losses of the [[American Civil War]] saw the first really large group of sculptural war memorials, as well as many monuments for individuals.  Among the most artistically outstanding is the Memorial to [[Robert Gould Shaw]] and the all-[[African American|black]] [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Regiment]] by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] in Boston, with a second cast in the [[National Gallery of Art, Washington]].  The even larger losses of World War I led even small communities in most nations involved to raise some form of memorial, introducing the widespread use of the form to Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the sudden increase in demand leading to a boom for sculptors of [[public art]].  Even more than in painting, the war brought a crisis in style, as much public opinion felt the traditional heroic styles inappropriate.  One of the most successful British memorials is the starkly realist [[Royal Artillery Memorial]] in London, the masterpiece of [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]], who had been wounded three times in the war and spent most of the next decade commemorating it.  In the defeated nations of Germany and Austria controversy, which had a political aspect, was especially fierce, and a number of memorials considered excessively modern were removed by the Nazis, whose own memorials, such as the [[Tannenberg Memorial]] were removed after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Mosse, 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; Other solutions were to make memorials more neutral, as in the repurposed [[Neue Wache]] in Berlin, since rededicated to different groups several times, and the dignified architectural forms of the [[Cenotaph#The Cenotaph, London|Cenotaph in London]] (widely imitated) and the German [[Laboe Naval Memorial]]; tombs of the [[Unknown Warrior]] and [[eternal flame]]s were other ways of avoiding controversy.  Some, like the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|Canadian National War Memorial]], and most French memorials, were content to update traditional styles.&lt;ref&gt;Mosse, 103–106 on conservatism, and generally throughout Chapter 5 on war memorials.&lt;/ref&gt;

A great number of World War I memorials were simply expanded in scope to cover the dead of World War II, and often subsequent conflicts. The now dominant role of [[photography]] in depicting war is reflected in the [[National Iwo Jima Memorial]], which recreates the iconic photograph ''[[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]''.  The [[National D-Day Memorial]], a project of the 1990s, includes strongly realist sculpture, in contrast to the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in Washington.  More innovative memorials have often been erected for the civilian victims of war, above all those of [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, throughout. His Chapter 1 gives an overview of the study of 19th and 20th century memorials&lt;/ref&gt;

====Purpose====
War art creates a visual account of military conflict by showing its impact as men and women are shown waiting, preparing, fighting, suffering, and celebrating.&lt;!--sent ends here --&gt;&lt;ref name="cwmartists"&gt;[[Canadian War Museum]] (CWM), [http://www.civilization.ca/cwm/exhibitions/artwar/introduction_e.shtml  "Australia, Britain and Canada in the Second World War,"] 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hichberger, J.W.M.

The thematic range embraces the causes, course and consequences of conflict.&lt;ref name="iwm_about"/&gt;

War art, a significant expression of any culture and its significant legacies, combines artistic and documentary functions to provide a pictorial portrayal of war scenes and show "how war shapes lives."&lt;!--sent ends here --&gt;&lt;ref name="iwm_about"&gt;[[Imperial War Museum]] (IWM), [http://www.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.604 About the Imperial War Museum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205040456/http://www.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.604 |date=2010-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, Laura.

(2010) [http://eprints.uwe.ac.uk/7876/2/Gough_Introduction_A_Terrible_Beauty.pdf ''A Terrible Beauty: British Artists in the First World War,'' p. 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the tussle includes determining how best to illustrate complex war scenes. [[Charles Bean|C.E.W. Bean]]'s ''Anzac Book'', for example, influenced Australian artists who grew up between the two world wars.  When they were asked to depict a second multi-nation war after 1939, there was a precedent and format for them to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, John B. (1977). ''Australian Artists at War,'' Vol. 2, p. 5; excerpt, "The Australian people first became familiar with Australasian ''war art'' as a genre with the publication of the so-called 'Christmas books' ... which contained the writings of servicemen and were illustrated by the current war artists."&lt;/ref&gt;

War art has been used as an instrument of propaganda, such as a nation-building function or other persuasive ends.&lt;ref name="foss157"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, {{Google books|kwg9g5vc4jUC|p. 6.|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandon, {{Google books|kwg9g5vc4jUC|p. 58.|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; War art is also captured in caricature, which offers contemporary insights.&lt;ref&gt;ASKB, [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/libweb/collections/askb/caricatures.php Caricature]&lt;/ref&gt;  Western Civilization and aesthetic tradition were both clearly marked by military conflicts throughout history.  War drove culture and culture drove war.  The legacy of war inspired artworks reads like a series of mile markers, documenting the meandering course of civilization's evolutionary map. &lt;ref&gt;Chase Maenius.

====War artists====
[[File:Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier - The Portrait of a Sergeant - WGA14740.jpg|thumb|Artist portraying a sergeant (1874), by [[Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier|Ernest Meissonier]].]]
War artists may be involved as onlookers to the scenes, military personnel who respond to powerful inner urges to depict direct war experience, or individuals who are officially commissioned to be present and record military activity.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ro8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=The+Oxford+Companion+to+Military+History+War+art+is+that+which+has+been+developed&amp;dq=The+Oxford+Companion+to+Military+History+War+art+is+that+which+has+been+developed&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LJ9YTPu0AY689QT9xLnsBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA ''Oxford Companion to Military History'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of nation's efforts to document war events, [[Japanese official war artists|official Japanese war artists]] were commissioned to create artwork in the context of a specific war for the Japanese government, including ''sensō sakusen kirokuga'' ("war campaign documentary painting"). Between 1937 and 1945, approximately 200 pictures depicting Japan's military campaigns were created.  These pictures were presented at large-scale exhibitions during the war years; After the end of World War II, Americans took possession of Japanese artwork.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, Barbara. (2005).  ''Artists of World War II'', pp. 111-126.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tsuruya_aas"&gt;Tsuruya, Mayu.

There are some who may choose not to create war art. During the course of World War II, the Italians created virtually no art which documented the conflict.  The French began to paint the war only after the war was ended in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Alan. (1983). ''Colours of War,'' p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical examples====
Examples of classical war art include the friezes of warriors at the [[Temple of Aphaia]] in Greece or the [[Bayeux Tapestry]], is a linear panoramic narrative of the events surrounding the [[Norman Conquest]] and the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stover, Eric ''et al.''

The '''''Miró Wall''''' is a ceramic tiled wall designed by Spanish artist [[Joan Miró]] for the [[Wilhelm Hack Museum]] in [[Ludwigshafen]], Germany. The wall, which comprises 7,200 tiles, is {{convert|55|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|10|m|ft}} high.

==Design==
The elements in the mural are colorful and fanciful creatures. The {{convert|55|x|10|m|ft}} mural was produced by [[Joan Gardy Artigas]].&lt;ref name=wilhelm&gt;{{cite web|title=The Miró Wall|url=http://www.wilhelmhack.museum/home/collection/the-miro-wall.html|publisher=Wilhelm Hack Museum|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He created the 7,200 tiles based on a design by Miró involving surreal figures and animals. Artigas had to work from an image which Miró had created at one-tenth the scale of the finished wall. Using that model, he marked out each section on an individual {{convert|20|x|36|cm|in}} tile. The artwork was completed in 1979 and includes the signatures of both artists at the bottom, left-hand corner. Miró's signature is undated; Artigas' signature is dated 1979.

Artigas was a second generation surrealist. His father had been a ceramicist for both [[Picasso]] and Miró. When Artigas' father wanted to retire, Miró brought the younger Artigas back from exile in France, where he had been avoiding the Spanish Francoist regime. Artigas junior worked with Miró for twenty years creating other similar sized murals for [[UNESCO]], [[IBM]] and the [[Palacio de Exposiciones y Congresos]] in Madrid.&lt;ref name=artigas&gt;{{cite web|title=Joan Gardy Artigas, Spanish (1938 - )|url=http://rogallery.com/Artigas_Joan_Gardy/artigas-biography.html|publisher=rogallery.com|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mural was opened at the same time as the new museum was built. It was in the town's market place and had been constructed to hold the art collection of the [[Cologne]] businessman, Wilhelm Hack, whose collection had been given to [[Ludwigshafen]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.wilhelmhack.museum/index.php?id=152|publisher=Wilhelm Hack Museum|accessdate=28 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hack saw the new museum as he died in 1985.

==Construction==
The tiles were [[Kiln|fired]] in [[Gallifa]], a village near Barcelona. They had to be transported {{convert|1200|km|mi}} to the museum. Because of the terrain, they were placed four to a box so they could be carried down the mountain by mule. After that, the tiles were transported by lorry and train to complete the journey from [[Catalonia]] (Spain) to south western Germany.&lt;ref name=lorry&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intertrans-gmbh.de/index.php?pg=22|title=The wall by Joan Miró|publisher=InterTrans Gmbh|accessdate=28 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wall has become discoloured from pollution and has not been cleaned because of the high cost.

'''Moche portrait vessels''' are ceramic vessels featuring highly individualized and naturalistic representations of human faces that are unique to the [[Moche culture]] of [[Peru]]. 

These portrait vessels are some of the few realistic portrayals of humans found in the [[Precolumbian]] Americas.&lt;ref name=texas&gt;Duncan, Christopher B. [http://www.utexas.edu/utpress/excerpts/exdonmoc.html "''Moche Portraits from Ancient Peru.'' Table of Contents and Excerpt."] ''University of Texas Press.'' 2003-2011 (retrieved 17 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moche==
The [[Moche culture]] thrived from 100—800 CE on the north coast of Peru. Their lands sat between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Andean]] [[cordillera]]. They were a stratified, agrarian society that also heavily relied on fishing.&lt;ref name=texas/&gt;

==Characteristics of the portrait vessels==
While most Moche portrait vessels feature heads, some portray full human figures. They are meant to hold liquids. Almost all of the portraits of are adult men. In some rare instances, young boys are represented, but no portrait vessels of adult women have yet been found. The portraits are not idealized, some feature abnormalities, such as [[harelip]]s and missing eyes.&lt;ref name=texas/&gt;

The vessels range from 6–45&amp;nbsp;cm in height, with most being between 15–30&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=texas/&gt;

Typically, Moche pottery features red slip painted on a pale cream background; however, white-on-red and black paint is also found.&lt;ref name=heil&gt;Bernier, Hélène. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/moch/hd_moch.htm "Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History: Moche Decorated Ceramics."] ''Metropolitan Museum of Art.'' (retrieved 17 July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; While most portraits are three-dimensional portrayals of human, some have additional fineline paintings on their surface.&lt;ref name=texas/&gt;

==Collections==
Over 900 separate portrait vessels have been photographed by the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. An estimated 95% of these portrait vessels were collected by looters instead of archaeologists, so the initial [[provenance]] of the vessels are unknown. Mostly they have been retrieved from graves but were used during people's lives, as evidenced by wear marks&lt;ref name=texas/&gt; and repairs.&lt;ref name=heil/&gt;

==Huaco Retrato Mochica==
[[File:Huaco Retrato Mochica.jpg|thumb|left|''Huaco Retrato Mochica'' in the [[Larco Museum]], in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]]]
One particularly famous Moche portrait vessel is known as the ''Huaco Retrato Mochica''. The portrait was made during the Late Moche period (ca. 600 CE), according to the chronology made by Rafael Larco Hoyle in 1948. The ceramic portrait is also an example of a [[stirrup spout vessel]] of a Moche ruler. The ruler is depicted wearing a material [[turban]] on which there is a headdress decorated by a two-headed bird with feathers on side. The effigy also wears tubular earrings that can be found in the "Gold and Silver Gallery" of the Larco Museum.

The exact archaeological context in which it was found in is unknown. Nonetheless, information gained from various archaeological discoveries in the North Coast over the past 20 years suggests that it belonged to the tomb of a member of the Moche elite. [[Archaeologist]]s found this type of headdress, made of reed, in the tomb of the warrior priest god in the Huaca de la Cruz, an archaeological site situated in the [[Virú Valley]], {{convert|abbr=on|40|km|0}} south of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], explored by Strong and Evans in 1940. It may also have been excavated from within the Moche Valley in the southern Moche region.

Rafael Larco Hoyle received this piece from his father, Rafael Larco Herrera. It is said{{By whom|date=December 2009}} that this was the only ceramic piece Herrera kept when he bequeathed his private collection to the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]] and that Herrera gave it to his son who later opened his private collection to the public at the Larco Museum.

'''Ori Gersht''' (born 1967) is an [[Israel]]i [[fine art photographer]]. He is a professor of photography at the [[University for the Creative Arts]] in [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]], Kent, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucreative.ac.uk/index.cfm?articleid=15756 Ori Gersht, UCA]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ori Gersht was born in Tel Aviv. He graduated in Photography, Film and Video from [[University of Westminster]], London and studied for an M.A. in Photography from the [[Royal College of Art]], London.
==Art career==
Gersht has exhibited widely in museums and galleries since the early 1990s. He is represented by Angles Gallery in Los Angeles, [[CRG Gallery]] in New York, Ben Brown Fine Arts in London, and [http://nogagallery.com/ Noga Gallery] in Tel Aviv. In 2012, Gersht's show ''History Repeating'' was mounted at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/arts/design/ori-gersht-history-repeating-at-museum-of-fine-arts-in-boston.html?pagewanted=all Beauty, Tender and Fleeting, Amid History’s Ire]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic themes==
Gersht engages the themes of life, death, violence, and beauty. His photographs and films transcribe  images of sites of historical significance—the [[Judean Desert]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Auschwitz]], the [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] region of [[Ukraine]], the Lister Route in the [[Pyrenees]] (on which [[Walter Benjamin]] made his ill-fated exodus from Nazi-occupied France)—into ciphers of psychological disruption. Such scenes may not seem out of the ordinary unto themselves, but, through the artist’s focused attention and treatment they evoke the emotional resonance of what has transpired—most often, violence, and, more significantly, the ghosts of war’s most egregious detritus, its refugees.
Pervasive in Gersht’s work is the [[landscape]], as a place, an idea, and an art historical trope. His films and photographs may be compared to paintings in their display—from their unhindered access (no Plexiglas separates their surfaces from the viewer) to the frames surrounding the monitors on which the films often play. Moreover, the vistas and horizons of, for instance, "Between Places" (1998–2000), "White Noise" (1999–2000), "The Clearing/Liquidation" (2005), and "Evaders" (2009), recall Romantic depictions of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]]. They conjure precedents in both photography, such as the breathtaking vistas of [[Andreas Gursky]] and the landscapes of the American South by [[Sally Mann]], and painting, by [[J.M.W. Turner]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]], and even [[Mark Rothko]].

In his  [[still life]] series Gersht investigated the relationships between [[photography]], [[technology]] and optical perception, at a pivotal moment in the history of photography where [[digital technology]] both threatens a crisis and promises a breakthrough. Research into the early history of the medium of photography is brought together with theoretical discourse, creating, still image and films that (literally) explode the genre of still life, the beautiful and destructive results captured using cutting-edge technology. In "Pomegranate", a film that references [[Juan Sanchez Cotan]]’s 17th-century still life and [[Harold Edgerton]]’s stroboscopic photography, a high velocity bullet flies across the frame in slow motion and obliterates a suspended [[pomegranate]] fruit, bursting it open and wheeling it slowly into the air like a smashed violated mouth spraying seeds. A peaceful image is transformed into bloodshed, and a dialogue is established between stillness and motion, peace and violence.

Gersht’s photographs and films provide a meditation on life, loss, destiny and chance.  Allusions to the catastrophic violence of the [[French Revolution]], the [[Spanish Civil War]], the bombing of [[Hiroshima]], and the suicide bombs that Gersht anticipated during his childhood in [[Israel]] can all be found in this work.  As such, it reminds us of our past, present, and future, and, above all, the fragility of life itself.

'''''Passerini Assumption''''' (Italian: ''Assunta Passerini'') is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist [[Andrea del Sarto]], painted in 1526. It is housed in the [[Galleria Palatina]] of [[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The work was commissioned by Margherita Passerini for her private altar in church of  Santa Maria fuori le mura at [[Cortona]]: the contract is dated 1526, for a price of 155 [[florin (Italian coin)|florins]]. In 1553 the friars of that church moved, together with their properties including this artwork, to the church of Sant'Antonio dei Servi. 

In 1639 the panel was acquired by Grand Duke [[Ferdinand II de' Medici]]; a copy paid by him to remain in the church is now in the Diocesan Museum of Cortona. the work later was moved to the current location, in pair with the similar [[Panciatichi Assumption]] also by Andrea del Sarto. 

==Description==
Andrea del Sarto painted this work using his previous [[Panciatichi Assumption]] as model. the few variants include the dark background, instead of a landscape, the different position of Mary and the angels around her, and the replacement of the right kneeling apostle with Blessed  [[Margaret of Cortona]], who was the donor's protector. The left apostle was replaced by [[St. Nicholas]], patron of the donor's father or dead son.

At the time of the execution of this version, Andrea del Sarto was already married, and (as mentioned by late biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]]) Mary's face is likely a portrait of his wife.

'''Pink Mammoth'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hena|first=Derek|title=Pink Mammoth|url=http://www.pinkmammoth.org/|website=Pink Mammoth|publisher=Pink Mammoth|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[San Francisco]]-based [[non-profit]] [[artist collective]], founded by Ryel K and Derek Hena in August, 2003. It is based partially on the philosophy of [[Burning Man]], a radically expressive temporary city held annually in the [[Black Rock Desert]] of [[Nevada]], and dedicated to unconditional self-support and free expression. It also is influenced by the [[Buddhist]] concept of the [[Boddhisattva]], a being dedicated to enabling, supporting, and encouraging others to reach their ultimate state of enlightenment.

The organization has maintained active residencies throughout San Francisco and has performed at significant San Francisco dance music venues including Mighty, Monarch, Public Works, Monroe, Supperclub, Mezzanine, Halcyon, Public Works, The Midway, The Great Northern, and Audio. These highlight the organization's heavy emphasis on community and expressive celebration by showcasing and promoting its own artist-participants, including DJs, percussionists, vocalists, live event artists, fabric designers, and graphic artists.

Pink Mammoth also participates in Burning Man, the [[Love Parade]], and many regional burns such as [[Apogaea]]. Its participants have represented the collective in [[Mexico]], [[London]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[New Zealand]], and throughout the [[United States]].

The '''Powerhouse Arts District''' is a historic warehouse district in [[Downtown Jersey City|Downtown]] [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]], which takes its name from the unused generating station [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse]] currently undergoing an extensive stabilization effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jclandmarks.org/campaign-warehousedistrict.shtml/ Warehouse Historic District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611052218/http://www.jclandmarks.org/campaign-warehousedistrict.shtml |date=2008-06-11 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpowerhouse.org/|title=Jersey City Powerhouse Official Website|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseycityindependent.com/author/admin/|title=The Jersey City Independent|work=The Jersey City Independent|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This neighborhood was previously called "WALDO", an acronym for Work And Live District Overlay, but has since been renamed though is still occasionally used on maps and in local parlance. Part of what was once called the [[Horseshoe, Jersey City|Horseshoe Section]],  the neighborhood's informal borders are [[Newport, Jersey City|Newport]] to the north, [[Exchange Place (Jersey City)|Exchange Place]] to the east, [[Paulus Hook]] to the south and [[Harsimus Cove]] to the west. 

The landmarked [[Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Warehouse]] is at Provost St. between 1st and Bay Sts ({{coord|40|43|16|N|74|2|25|W|name=Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Warehouse}}). The [[Pavonia-Newport (HBLR station)|Pavonia-Newport]], [[Harsimus Cove (HBLR station)|Harsimus Cove]], and [[Harborside Financial Center (HBLR station)|Harborside]] stations of the [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]], and the [[Grove Street (PATH station)|Grove Street]] station of the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] system are nearby.

==WALDO and PAD==
[[File:Great-a-p-warehouse-jersey-city.jpg|thumb|left|The A &amp; P Warehouse]]
'''WALDO''' was the name of a planning strategy adopted into Jersey City zoning in 2002 per a proposal written by the [[Urban Land Institute]], and was deleted from the zoning on January 24, 2007. As the name implies, the purpose was to most effectively re-use an eight block area of industrial buildings, and transition them to include more residences, without zoning them a purely residential use. Currently, most zoning codes do not allow industrial and residential uses to co-exist on the same lot. The district also aimed at retaining the high bulk, low rise industrial buildings which were threatened by development of high rise towers in the area.

The plan indicated that roughly half of the apartments built in the existing industrial buildings in the eight block neighborhood must go to artists. Under the district plan, two industrial buildings were renovated into loft apartments, and one new building, Waldo Lofts, was constructed. During the district's lifespan, there were several attempts to bring in more housing and studios for artists, to make the area more pedestrian friendly, and to bring in art schools or museums.  There were also been proposals to turn the Powerhouse into residences, shops, galleries, and museum space.

Most of the proposals for retail and gallery space never materialized or found tenants, and as a result the eight blocks of industrial buildings remain much the same as in 2002 when the district began. As well, the city approved new zoning for a large development on First Street which deviated from the district plan.  New zoning is proposed for several other blocks. Most proposed developments are higher rise structures, and the majority of capital investment in the district favors high rise development. These factors led to WALDO being removed from the zoning ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/15/nyregion/15towns.html|title=Adjusting Vision of Waterfront Arts District to Include High Rises|date=15 May 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waldo Yards==
The term Waldo has been used before the zoning plan was introduced. Waldo Avenue is named for Samuel Waldo who built and owned three attached brownstone homes located on the NW corner of Magnolia and Waldo Avenues.  Today, the three structures still stand.The avenue which runs south from [[Newark Plank Road|Newark Avenue]] to "[[Hilltop, Jersey City|The Island]]" a remnant outcropping of [[Bergen Hill]], which in turn overlooks the Waldo Yards, originally used by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] [[Jersey City Branch]], and now by [[Port Authority Trans Hudson]] mass transit trains.

'''Rita Clay Estrada''' (born July 31, 1941, in [[Michigan]], US) is a US writer of [[romance novels]] as '''Rita Clay''', '''Tira Lacy''' and '''Rita Clay Estrada''', she has also written non-fiction books about writing romance novels. She was the first president of the [[Romance Writers of America]], and founding member with her mother [[Rita Gallagher]].

==Biography==
Born Rita Clay on July 31, 1941, in [[Michigan]], US.  Her mother, [[Rita Gallagher]], was a former Miss Michigan, a romance novelist and a noted writing instructor, while her father was a pilot with the [[U.S. Air Force]].  She spent much of her early years living in Europe.  She married her high school sweetheart when she was very young and stayed at home to raise their four children.  In 1977, when she had been married about 20 years, her husband brought her a typewriter and said, "'You said you always wanted to write.  Now write.'"&lt;ref name="racine"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Racine|first=Marty|title=Romancing the word|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=August 26, 1995|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1995_1293554|accessdate=August 16, 2007|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first attempt was a long historical romance which was promptly rejected.  Her next manuscript, a contemporary romance, was likewise rejected.  Her third manuscript, ''Wanderer's Dream,'' sold to [[Harlequin Enterprises Ltd|Silhouette Books]].  She used her maiden name, Rita Clay for that and an additional seven titles for Silhouette.  In 1982, she moved to Dell to write for their Candlelight Ecstasy line.  Harlequin owned her pen name, so she wrote as Tira Lacy, an anagram of Rita Clay.  In 1985 she re-signed with Harlequin and asked to use her full name, Rita Clay Estrada, on all future books.&lt;ref name="racine"/&gt;

She generally takes 4.5 months to write a novel.  Except for punctuation and fact-checking, she does very little rewriting, as "that's why there are editors."&lt;ref name="racine"/&gt; Generally, she writes five pages each night and more on the weekends.  Her novels have been translated in 23 languages.&lt;ref name="racine"/&gt;

Estrada was a founding member and the first president of the [[Romance Writers of America]] (RWA).  Their signature award, the RITA, which is the highest award of excellence given in the genre of [[romance novel|romantic fiction]], is named for her.&lt;ref name="rwa"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Romance Writers of America]]|title=RITA Awards|url=https://www.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=RWA&amp;WebKey=626513aa-6aaa-4e14-9873-6a3c1efbaa87|accessdate=July 4, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630232429/https://www.rwanational.org/eweb/DynamicPage.aspx?Site=RWA&amp;WebKey=626513aa-6aaa-4e14-9873-6a3c1efbaa87|archivedate=June 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RWA also awarded Estrada their Lifetime Achievement Award in 2000.&lt;ref name="ward"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Crescent Blues| last=Ward|first=Jean Marie|title=RWA National 2000: Contrasting Passions|url=http://www.crescentblues.com/3_4issue/rwa.shtml|accessdate=July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The River Horse''''' is a bronze sculpture of a [[hippopotamus]] located on the campus of [[George Washington University]]. It is in front of [[Lisner Auditorium]], at 21st Street and H Street, [[Northwest, Washington, D.C.]], in the [[Foggy Bottom]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2000/06/12/News/Gws-Oddities-18270.shtml| title=GW's oddities| work=The GW Hatchet| author= Laura Milner| date= 2000-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, George Washington University President [[Stephen Joel Trachtenberg]] presented this bronze statue as a gift to the University's Class of 2000. The hippo stands with its mouth wide. Its nose is slightly worn due to passerby rubbing it. A plaque is placed on the base:

:Legend has it that the Potomac was once home to these wondrous beasts.
:George &amp; Martha Washington are even said to have watched them cavort in
:the river shallows from the porch of their beloved Mount Vernon on summer evenings.
:Credited with enhancing the fertility of the plantation, the Washingtons believed
:the hippopatamus brought them good luck &amp; children on the estate often attempted
:to lure the creatures close enough to the shore to touch a nose for good luck.

:So, too, may generations of students of the George Washington University.
:Art for wisdom,
:Science for joy,
:Politics for beauty,
:And a Hippo for hope.

The hippopotamus is not native to North America.  President Trachtenberg admitted he invented the story.  He said that, for fun, he made up a story that George Washington watched hippos swim in the Potomac River.  http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trachtenberg-reveals-truth-behind-hippo   http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Petition-Seeks-to-Change-GW-Colonials-to-the-GW-Hippos-481773571.html

[[Soria]], Spain) is an independent [[curator]], [[art critic]] and international art advisor based in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]]. 

==Career==
As an independent curator, Rosa Martínez has organised international exhibitions, including the 51st [[Venice Biennale]] with "Always a Little Further" at the Arsenale (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://universes.art/specials/intimidad-es-politica/rosa-martinez/|title=Rosa Martínez - Biography. Intimacy is Political|website=universes.art|language=en-EN|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of this exhibition was taken from a [[Corto Maltese]] book written by the Venetian-writer [[Hugo Pratt]]. In her curatorial statement Martínez elaborates on this by stating: "Taking a fictional character as inspiration is a way of affirming that art is an imaginary construct and that fantasy helps us towards a better understanding of reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://universes-in-universe.de/car/venezia/bien51/eng/arsenale/text-1.htm|title=Always a Little Further|last=Martínez|first=Rosa|date=February 2005|website=universe in universe - worlds of art|access-date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">The '''Scriblerus Club''' was an informal association of authors, based in London, that came together in the early 18th century. They were prominent figures in the [[Augustan literature|Augustan Age]] of English letters. The nucleus of the club included the satirists [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Alexander Pope]]. Other members were [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St. John]] and [[Thomas Parnell]]. The group was founded in 1714 and lasted until the death of the founders, finally ending in 1745. Pope and Swift are the two members whose reputations and work have the most long-lasting influence. Working collaboratively, the group created the persona of '''Martinus Scriblerus''', through whose writings they accomplished their satirical aims. Very little of this material, however, was published until the 1740s. [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer]] occasionally joined the club for meetings, though he is not known to have contributed to their literary output.  He, along with Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, contributed to the literary productions of the Club.

The club began as an effort to satirize the abuses of learning wherever they might be found, which led to ''[[The Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus]]''. The second edition of Pope's ''[[The Dunciad]]'' also contains work attributed to Martinus Scriblerus.

[[Richard Owen Cambridge]] wrote a [[mock epic]] poem, the ''Scribleriad'', where the hero is Martinus Scriblerus.

[[Henry Fielding]]'s play ''[[The Welsh Opera]]'' is presented as a tribute to the "Scriblerians".  Fielding's pen name was "Scriblerus Secundus."

'''''Sentimental Ballad''''' is a 1940 painting by the American artist [[Grant Wood]]. It depicts a group of singing men in a bar.

The painting is located at the [[New Britain Museum of American Art]] in [[New Britain, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arthistoryreference.com/cgi-bin/hd.exe?art2=a10870|title=Grant Wood. Sentimental Ballad|work=ArtHistortReference|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The painting came to be because of Wood's art dealer [[Associated American Artists]] and the film producer [[Walter Wanger]], who commissioned nine popular artists to paint a motif from the upcoming film ''[[The Long Voyage Home]]'', directed by [[John Ford]]. The other artists who participated were [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Benton]], [[George Biddle]], [[James Ormsbee Chapin|James Chapin]], [[Ernest Fiene]], [[Robert Philipp]], Luis Quintanilla Isasi, [[Raphael Soyer]] and Georges Schreiber. The artists visited the set of the film for several weeks in May 1940. Wood's scene is toward the end of the film and features, from left to right, the actors [[John Qualen]], [[John Wayne]], [[Barry Fitzgerald]], [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]], [[Joe Sawyer]], David Hughes and [[Jack Pennick]].&lt;ref name="nbmaa"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbmaa.org/original-site-assets/timeline_highlights/essays/wood.html|title=''Sentimental Ballad'', 1940|publisher=[[New Britain Museum of American Art]]|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Although originally commissioned for the marketing of a film, the painting was well received in the press and went on to tour American museums.&lt;ref name="nbmaa" /&gt;

'''''Still Life with Lemons, Oranges and a Rose''''' is an oil-on-canvas painting by [[Baroque]] [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artist [[Francisco de Zurbarán]] completed in 1633. It is currently displayed at the [[Norton Simon Museum]] in [[Pasadena, California]] as part of its permanent collection. It is the only [[still life]] signed and dated by him and is considered a masterwork of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/arts/design/27fric.html?fta=y&amp;pagewanted=all Sharing Reflections of Tycoon Taste and Wealth], ''New York Times,'' Feb. 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nortonsimon.org/collections/browse_title.php?id=F.1972.06.P Still Life with Lemons, Oranges and a Rose], "Norton Simon Museum, 2012" &lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition and Analysis==

The painting shows three groups of objects (a saucer of four citrons, a basket of oranges, and a saucer holding both a cup of water and a rose) resting on a table against a dark background. Each group of objects are placed equidistant from one another and form a spatial and geometrical balance due to their pyramidal organization. As described by Andreas Prater:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O7YSKD3scdcC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=zurbaran+still+life+lemons+rose&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=23WgT483poWIAsWIwMMC&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=zurbaran%20still%20life%20lemons%20rose&amp;f=false Masterpieces of Western Art: A history of art in 900 individual studies], page 264&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|"'Zurbaran isolates the objects from one another - even the composition appears to be a conscious, though not excessively artificial arrangement. Against the dark background, the objects are completely static, and appear to be torn out of the context of everyday life. The human beings to whom they apparently belong have no place here. }}
'' 
Norman Bryson writes:&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9iF1YAlJH0sC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=zurbaran+still+life+lemons+rose&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=UHigT9zGNofViALFteCVAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CFIQ6wEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Looking at the Overlooked: Four Essays on Still Life Painting], page 88&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|"'''Lemons, Oranges, Cup and a Rose'' shows a visual field so purified and so perfectly composed that the familiar objects seem on the brink of transfiguration or (the inevitable word) transubstantiation. Standing at some imminent intersection with the divine, and with eternity, they exactly break with the normally human. }}
'' 
Many of Zurbaran's works contained Christian themes, and the objects in the painting are often interpreted as having symbolic meaning as alluding to the [[Holy Trinity]] or as an homage to the Virgin Mary. 

Morten Lauridsen wrote in the ''Wall Street Journal'':&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123516723329736303 "It's a Still Life That Runs Deep"]. ''Wall Street Journal'', 02/21/2009 &lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|"'...the objects in this work are symbolic offerings to the Virgin Mary. Her love, purity and chastity are signified by the rose and the cup of water. The lemons are an Easter fruit that, along with the oranges with blossoms, indicate renewed life. The table is a symbolic altar.}}

'''Temple Bar Gallery + Studios''' ('''TBG+S''') is located in the centre of [[Temple Bar, Dublin]]. 

==Description==
The organisation was founded in 1983 and the original studios and gallery were located in a former shirt factory. The current building is a mid-nineties structure that was built on the same site as part of the Temple Bar Architectural Framework Plan. The building is designed by Irish architects McCullough/Mulvin, who were one of the architectural practices involved in the Group 91 consortium that wrote the plan&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archiseek.com/tag/group-91-architects/|title=Group '91 Architects Archives – Archiseek – Irish Architecture|website=Archiseek – Irish Architecture|dead-url=|access-date=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The building contains a [[contemporary art|contemporary visual art]] gallery and thirty artists studios.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiseek.com/2010/1994-temple-bar-gallery-studios/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dublinculturetrail.ie/Venue.aspx?id=124bc173-a5de-4b8d-ab1d-7568d9a34b17 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=13 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110908025902/http://www.dublinculturetrail.ie/Venue.aspx?id=124bc173-a5de-4b8d-ab1d-7568d9a34b17 |archivedate=8 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Temple Bar Gallery + Studios is a limited company with charitable status that is artist-led.  The voluntary Board is formally elected by the artist membership and comprises four artist members and five external professionals with different expertise and business acumen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Board members :: Temple Bar Gallery + Studios :: Dublin Ireland.|url = http://www.templebargallery.com/info/about/board|website = ''templebargallery.com''|accessdate = 13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple Bar Gallery + Studios is a [[Non-profit organization|not for profit]] registered charity and receives its core funding from [[Arts Council of Ireland|the Arts Council of Ireland]]. TBG+ S is part of a residency exchange programme with HIAP International Residency Exchange Programme. The gallery has been chosen to receive funding of an exchange of a student in Finland. In 2008 the Finnish photographer [[Heli Rekula]] spent her year here.&lt;ref name=kias&gt;[http://www.finnish-institute.org.uk/en/articles/240-heli-rekula Irish/Finnish Artist Exchange Award 2008], Finnish Institute, 2008. Retrieved 14 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 a sculpture by Irish artist [[Garrett Phelan]] consisting of a metal arch bearing the words ''Our Union Only in Truth'' was added to the roof of the building. The commission was funded through an online crowd funding campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Union Only in Truth: Garrett Phelan on Dublin's newest landmark|url = http://totallydublin.ie/arts-culture/our-union-only-in-truth-garrett-phelan-on-dublins-newest-landmark/|website = Totally Dublin|accessdate = 14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Temple Bar Gallery + Studios – For Impact Learning {{!}} Newstream|url = http://www.businesstoarts.ie/newstream/blog/temple-bar-gallery-studios-for-impact-learning/|website = www.businesstoarts.ie|accessdate = 14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The 9th Company''''' ({{lang-ru|9 Рота}}) is a 2005 [[Cinema of Russia|Russian]] [[war film]] directed by [[Fedor Bondarchuk]] and set during the [[Soviet–Afghan War]]. The film is loosely based on a real-life battle that took place at [[Battle for Hill 3234|Elevation 3234]] in early 1988, during the last large-scale [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military operation ([[Operation Magistral|Magistral]]) in Afghanistan.

==Plot==
At a farewell ceremony in [[Krasnoyarsk]], a band of young [[Soviet Army]] recruits is preparing for their departure to their place of military service. On arrival at their bootcamp in the [[Fergana Valley]] of [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]] they meet their drill instructor, Senior [[Warrant Officer|Praporschik]] Dygalo, a seasoned, traumatized veteran of several tours in Afghanistan and a brutal trainer who treats the recruits harshly and at one time suffers a nervous breakdown. During their training, the recruits overcome their differences and build bonds. Between the training sessions, they receive lessons in operating [[plastic explosive]]s (which prompts some comic relief) and how to conduct themselves in Afghanistan (underlining the vast cultural differences between Western and Afghan culture).

On their arrival at [[Bagram Airfield|Baghram air base]] they greet a group of [[Russian Airborne Troops|VDV]] troops who have fulfilled their military service and are due to return home. One of the departing soldiers gives one of the new arrivals, Lyutyi, a talisman that he claims has kept him safe through several tours and multiple firefights. Homeward bound, the departing soldier's transport plane is hit by enemy fire from the nearby mountains and crashes, giving the new recruits their first taste of war.

Shortly thereafter, the soldiers are assigned to the 9th company, where their trainer and drill instructor, Dygalo, had previously served. The company is soon deployed to the front as part of [[Operation Magistral]] and is instructed to hold a nameless hill at all costs. After some preliminary skirmishes, the company's position comes under sustained attack by a large number of [[Mujahedin]] fighters and is overrun. In the end, the company holds the hill until reinforcements arrive, by which time seemingly only Lyutyi is still alive.

==Historical parallel==
In the film, only one soldier from the company is shown to have survived unscathed and the company is said to have been "forgotten" by command because of the Soviet withdrawal. In reality, the 9th Company, [[345th Independent Guards Airborne Regiment]] was pinned down under heavy fire on ''Hill 3234'' from 7–8 January 1988. They managed to stop three attacks by an estimated 200-250 mujahideen. The company lost a total of 6 men. Another 28 out of the total 39 were seriously wounded. Four of the killed soldiers were [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the golden star of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]]. The unit was in constant communication with headquarters and received everything the regimental commander, Colonel [[Valery Vostrotin]], could provide in terms of rations, ammunition, reinforcements, and [[helicopter]] evacuation of the wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, ''The Russian Elite'', Greenhill, 1993, pp. 120-125&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Crucifixion of Saint Andrew''''' (1607) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] Baroque master [[Caravaggio]]. It is in the collection of the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], which acquired it from the Arnaiz collection in Madrid in 1976, having been taken to Spain by the Spanish Viceroy of Naples in 1610.

The incident depicted, the martyrdom of Saint Andrew, was supposed to have taken place in Patras, Greece. The saint, bound to the cross with ropes, was said to have survived two days, preaching to the crowd and eventually converting them so that they demanded his release.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Monumenta Germaniae Historica'' II, cols. 821-847, translated in M.R. James, ''The Apocryphal New Testament'' (Oxford) reprinted 1963:369.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Roman [[Proconsul]] Aegeas&lt;ref name=Graham-Dixon/&gt; - depicted lower right - ordered him taken down, his men were struck by a miraculous paralysis, in answer to the saint's prayer that he be allowed to undergo martyrdom.&lt;ref name=Langdon&gt;{{cite book|last=Langdon|first=Helen|title=Caravaggio: A Life|year=2000|publisher=Westview Press|isbn=9780813337944|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Caravaggio.html?id=PHwNAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 17th century [[Saint Andrew]] was shown on a diagonal cross, but Caravaggio would have been influenced by the 16th century belief that he was crucified on a normal Latin cross.

==History==
On 11 July 1610 [[Juan Alonso Pimentel de Herrera, 5th Duke of Benavente]], left Naples for Spain, having served as viceroy of that city for seven years. With him he a took a painting [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori]] described as "la Crocifissione di Santo Andrea".&lt;ref name=Bellori&gt;{{cite book|last=Bellori|first=Giovanni|title=Le vite de’ pittori, scultori et architetti moderni|year=1672|publisher=Mascardi|location=Rome|page=214|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aEk_AAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Vite+de'Pittori,+Scultori+et+Architetti&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-CEA7ytHPI&amp;sig=ts741mfIzRzWfm8KvB_BAFJVkYU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8_JCUML2HM2pqwG714DQBA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Vite%20de'Pittori%2C%20Scultori%20et%20Architetti&amp;f=false| authorlink=Gian Pietro Bellori}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wohl&gt;{{cite book|last=Bellori|first=Giovanni Pietro|title=Giovanni Pietro Bellori: The Lives of the Modern Painters, Sculptors and Architects: A New Translation and Critical Edition|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521781879|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9gs8mXwOUC|editor=Hellmut Wohl|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was installed at the family palace in [[Valladolid]], where it was appraised, in 1653,{{efn|Archivo Histórico de Protocolos, Valladolid, España (Prot. 1.118)}} at 1,500 ducats, by far the highest value painting in the family collection.&lt;ref name=Lurie&gt;{{cite journal|last= Tzeutschler Lurie |first=Ann|author2=Denis Mahon |title=Caravaggio's Crucifixion of Saint Andrew from Valladolid|journal=The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art|date=January 1977|volume=64|issue=1|pages=2–24|jstor=25152672}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occasion for the appraisal came with the death of the [[Juan Francisco Pimentel, 7th Duke of Benavente|7th Duke of Benavente]] in December 1652.

The appraiser was [[Diego Valentín Díaz]] who described the work as "a large painting of a nude St Andrew when he is being put on the cross with three executioners and a woman, with an ebony frame"{{efn|muy grande de pintura de san andres desnudo quando le estan poniendo en la cruz con tres sayones y una muger con moldura de ebano}} and it is attributed to "micael angel caraballo". This painting was almost certainly commissioned by the viceroy, who was especially devoted to Saint Andrew and played a role in renovating the crypt of Saint Andrew in the [[Amalfi Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=Graham-Dixon&gt;{{cite book|last=Graham-Dixon|first=Andrew|title=Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=9780241954645|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9lI76naiYuMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Valladolid painting is thought to be the same as the present work, acquired by the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1976. There are three other versions of the composition: one (198 x 147.5&amp;nbsp;cm) formerly part of the Back-Vega collection, Vienna,&lt;ref&gt;Back-Vega, Emmerich; Christa Back-Vega (March 1958).

[[JSTOR]] 3047748.&lt;/ref&gt; and now part of the Spier Collection, London, attributed to Caravaggio between 1954 – 1973 by some art historians such as Giuseppe Fiocco, Hermann Voss and Antonio Morassi, and considered a copy (by Louis Finson) by others, especially after the rediscovery of the version now in Cleveland in 1974. Since 2011, the former Back-Vega exemplar has again been attributed to Caravaggio, as a second version.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CARAVAGGIO: La crocifissione di Sant’Andrea Back-Vega: The Back-Vega Crucifixion of St. Andrew|last=Papi|first=Gianni|publisher=Skira, Milan, 2016, {{ISBN|9788857232379}}.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Una vita per la storia dell’arte: scritti in memoria di Maurizio Marini'' curated by Pietro Loreto; etgraphiae 2015: contribution by Pierluigi Carofano pp. 104-109 (with citations and references: in particular to favorable opinions by di Mina Gregori, Didier Bodart, Gianni Papi and Bruno Arciprete), pp. 116, 464 (&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.academia.edu/29644718/Ai_margini_della_SACRA_FAMIGLIA_CON_SAN_GIOVANNINO_del_Caravaggio_e_una_riflessione_sulla_CROCIFISSIONE_DI_SANT_ANDREA_ex_collezione_Back-Vega_la_fortuna_delle_repliche_e_delle_copie_in_Una_Vita_per_la_Storia_dellArte._Scritti_in_memoria_di_Maurizio_Marini_Foligno_Etgraphie_2015_pp._97-116&lt;/nowiki&gt;).

'''''The Four Witches''''' (German: '''''Die Vier Hexen'''''), or '''''The Four Naked Women''''',&lt;ref name="H241"&gt;Hutchison, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''The Four Sorceresses'''''&lt;ref name="Br129"&gt;Brion, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''Scene in a Brothel''''') are titles given to a 1497 [[engraving]] by the German Renaissance artist [[Albrecht Dürer]]. One of his earliest signed engravings,&lt;ref name="s143"&gt;Stumpel, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; it shows four nude, exuberant women gathered conspiratorially in a circle in a confined interior setting, perhaps a bath house,&lt;ref name="s157"&gt;Stumpel, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; which appears to have entrances from either side. Although clearly erotic, a small horned demon, perhaps representing temptation,&lt;ref name="s156"&gt;Stumpel, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; is positioned in the left hand portal, peering out and holding what may be a hunting object, and is engulfed in flames. 

Although the engraving has been subject to prolonged and significant scholarly analysis, it remains enigmatic, and there is nothing in his later writings to indicate his intent.&lt;ref&gt;Callow, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; There is no consensus as to its subject matter or its intended meaning, with art historians associating it with either [[witch-hunt|witch hunting]] or figures from classical mythology. The women stand underneath a suspended globe or sphere, and before an open stone window, which, given the human skull and thigh bone placed across from it, may be a gateway to death,&lt;ref name="Nürnberg15"&gt;Nürnberg, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and that the women are engaged in some type of nefarious scheme, perhalps linked to the 1487 [[inquisition]] treatis [[Malleus Maleficarum]].&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;"[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=765010&amp;partId=1&amp;images=true The Four Witches; a group of four nude women standing underneath a sphere]". [[British Museum]]. Retrieved 1 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative view is that the women represent Greek or Roman goddesses, perhaps [[Hecate]], patroness of evil magic, poisonous plants, and ghosts, or her earthly counterpart [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].&lt;ref name="RI"&gt;"[https://risdmuseum.org/art_design/objects/342_the_four_witches The Brilliant Line: Following the Early Modern Engraver, 1480-1650]". Rhode Island School of Design, 2009. Retrieved 2 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

Dürer's monogram "AD" is placed on the at the center of the floor. Numerous original prints exist, and are held at a number of major museums.

==Description==
The women are positioned in an small interior space which contains a window and can be entered or exited from two sides. The small devil in the left hand recess, who is intended to represent evil,  as mammalian anatomy including hind legs, and holds a vaguely described object in his claw that appears to consist of sticks and a piece of string,&lt;ref name="s146"&gt;Stumpel, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps comprising a contemporary device for hunting birds and fowl.&lt;ref name="s150"&gt;Stumpel, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; The devil's form and gestures closely resembles a similar small bat-like monster in Durer's ''The Dream of the Doctor'' of 1498-99, an engraving close in date and style to the ''Four Witches''.&lt;ref name="m13"&gt;Minott, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="s154"&gt;Stumpel, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The differing hairstyles and headdress suggests that the women are from different social classes;&lt;ref name="p27"&gt;Pelaez, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; differing types of headdresses were often used in medieval and early Renaissance pictures to indicate social and moral aspects of the individual person. This was especially so in [[Nuremberg]], where guidelines on the matter were issued by the Nuremberg council. The woman on the left wears a ''Haube'' (a type of [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]], in German a ''Festhaube''), usually the preserve of married women. The woman to the far right, facing the viewer, wears a long folded [[veil]] (''Schleier''), indicating that she comes from the middle-class.&lt;ref name="s158"&gt;Stumpel, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; 

At this early stage in his life, Dürer was struggling with both the restrictions of drawing for engraving, and the portrayal of nudes. Compared to his udes in the near contemporary ''Small Fortune'' which shows a female satyr nursing her infant, or ''The Penance of St John Chrysostom'', the current work seems more reliant on Renaissance proto-types, although they are, according to art historian Charles Ilsley Minott "taller, sturdier, and more graceful."&lt;ref name="m11"&gt;Minott, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
[[File:Albrecht Dürer - The Dream of the Doctor (Temptation of the Idler) (NGA 1943.3.3481).jpg|220px|left|thumb|Albrecht Dürer, ''The Dream of the Doctor'', engraving, 1498-99. This engraving similarly associates a nude figure with diabolic activity]]
As with many of Dürer's engravings, the intended meaning or source is unclear; although it has been subject to wide scholarly analysis, no real consensus has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Hults, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Possible interpretations range from the [[season|four seasons]] and the [[Classical element|four elements]], to [[Aphrodite]] (represented here by the woman to the right wearing a myrtle wreath)&lt;ref name="H241" /&gt; and [[Charites|the Graces]], the [[Moirai|Three Fates]], or more simply four [[Witchcraft|witches]] or four girls in a [[brothel]].&lt;ref name="s144"&gt;Stumpel, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian Marcel Briton suggests that the work may not have any specific meaning, and is simply a portrait of four nudes, "the whim of a young artist annoyed by the puritanical conventionality of his fellow-citizens".&lt;ref name="Br129" /&gt;

Because Dürer did not title the work it has been given many titles over the centuries. When the painting was first described by Karel van Mander in 1604, he wrote that it contained "three or four nude women, looking just like the three Graces." Common titles have included ''Scene in a Brothel'', ''Scene of Witchcraft'', ''Venus and the Three Graces'', ''The Seasons of the Year'', ''The Four Temperaments'',&lt;ref name="s144"&gt;Stumpel, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Diana and Hecate Trivia''.&lt;ref name="ms"&gt;Sullivan, pp. 332-401&lt;/ref&gt;

===Witchcraft===
The human skull and bone left on the floor are intended as either reminders of death,&lt;ref name="s143" /&gt; or symbols of magic and invocation.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nationalgalleries.org/art-and-artists/34303/four-witches The Four Witches]". National Galleries of Scotland. Retrieved 1 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The witches interpretation may be misogynistically linked to the "Malleus maleficarum" (''The Witches' Hammer'') the "virulent diatribe"&lt;ref name="sl337"&gt;Sullivan, p. 337&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1487 by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] monks and inquisitors [[Heinrich Kramer]] and [[Jacob Sprenger]]. The book endorsed the extermination of witches and so developed a convoluted and detailed legal and theological theory to justify its treatise.&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt; 

[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Witch Riding on a Goat (NGA 1943.3.3556).jpg|thumb|200px|Albrecht Dürer, ''Witch Riding Backwards on a Goat'', engraving, c. 1500]] 
Because the women's hands are largely hidden, it is not supposed that the image refers to any specific activity or event. However it was at the time commonly believed that men who had sex with so called she-devils would later suffer from illness and impotence. Around 1500 Durer produced ''Witch Riding Backwards on a Goat'', which, according to art historian Margaret Sullivan, like the current work, reflects "a fascination with the underside of the ancient world rather than an interest in witch manuals or a compelling concern with witchcraft as a punishable offense."&lt;ref name="sl334"&gt;Sullivan, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the engraving is sometimes examined alongside The engraving resembles in a number of ways [[Hans Baldung Grien]]'s ''Bewitched Groom'', completed the year before before his death in 1545. However, it is important to note that Dürer and Baldung's works, while contemporary with the "Malleus maleficarum", come before the widespread outbreak of moral panic leading to the  [[Witch-hunt|witch-hunting]] of the later 16th and 17th centuries. According to Sullivan, "The work of Direr and Baldung belong to an earlier era, they testify to a different sensibility and were produced by artists who could not have foreseen the terrible times to come"&lt;ref name="sl334" /&gt;

===Classical mythology===
The most accepted meaning is that the work is an allegorical warning against discord, and it's inevitable lead to hell and death. Compositionally, the positioning of the women matches a marble group of the three graces known in the [[quattrocento|early Renaissance]], and likely Dürer would have seen it from copies.&lt;ref name="Nürnberg15" /&gt;  A common interpretation is that figures represent Hecate, who according to the "often represented with three faces or bodies, probably to suggest that she could look in all directions at doorways or crossings".&lt;ref name="RI" /&gt; Alternatively, the woman from the second right wearing a wreath may represents [[Eris (mythology)|Discordia]], the Roman goddess of strife and discord, who threw an apple amongst [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Minerva]] and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], igniting the [[Trojan War]]. Or it may be that that woman is being initiated by three witches.

The globe hanging above the figures is divided into twelve segments, and contains two inscriptions; the year 1497,&lt;ref name="s143" /&gt; and, outlined with girdling, and the letters  "&lt;small&gt;OGH&lt;/small&gt;" - perhaps meaning "Odium generis humani" (''[[Odium theologicum|Odium]] (disgust or ambush) against the human race''), or "Oh Gott hüte" (''Oh God Forbid'') as suggested in 1675 by the German art-historian and painter [[Joachim von Sandrart]], or "Ordo Graciarum Horarumque" (''Order of the Graces and Hours'').

==Influence==
The image has been copied and adapted a number of times. Nicoletto da Modena (1490-1569) produced a version based on the [[Judgement of Paris]] interpretation, changing the inscription on the globe to "Detur Pulchrior" (''To the fairest''), and omitted the devil and bones.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;

The Austrian artist Adolf Frohner (b. 1934) produced a version where the women are shown wearing bras and garter belts.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack''''', often referred to as simply '''''The Heroin Diaries''''', is the debut [[studio album]] by [[Sixx:A.M.]], a side project of [[Mötley Crüe]] bassist [[Nikki Sixx]]. The band also features lead vocalist [[James Michael]] and guitarist [[DJ Ashba]]. The [[concept album]]&lt;ref name="concept"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nikki Sixx - ARTISTdirect NEWS |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,4400841,00.html |publisher=[[artistdirect.com]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as the companion [[soundtrack]] to Sixx's autobiography, ''[[The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]'', and is about Sixx's severe [[heroin]] addiction in 1987. The first single, "[[Life Is Beautiful (Sixx:A.M. song)|Life Is Beautiful]]," debuted at #26 on the [[Billboard charts]].&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&amp;f=Hot+Mainstream+Rock+Tracks|title=Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|accessdate=2007-10-23 |format= |work=Billboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Designed to be an accompaniment to ''[[The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]'', the autobiography of [[Mötley Crüe]] bassist [[Nikki Sixx]] co-written by Sixx and Ian Gittens that details his severe heroin addiction in 1987, ''The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack'' is a [[concept album]] that captures Sixx's basic story of his life during that time, although the album can stand alone. The story begins with the reasons for Sixx starting his diary, followed by his first (albeit temporary) abstinence from heroin, his relapse and mental and physical decline, his near-fatal overdose and [[out-of-body experience]], and finally, his emotional recovery, which eventually led to long-term sobriety. The 13 tracks on the album each correspond to one month of his diary, which he kept from December 1986 to December 1987. Some of the tracks feature spoken word featuring Sixx himself reading some lines from the book.

==Release==
"[[Life Is Beautiful (Sixx:A.M. song)|Life Is Beautiful]]", the first [[single (music)|single]] off the album, was originally posted on Sixx's [[MySpace]] page; after "[picking] up momentum,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/nikkisixx_2.htm|title=Interview with Nikki Sixx|accessdate=2007-10-23 |work=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; it debuted at #26 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard]] rock singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?reviewid=13214&amp;page=1|title=Heroin Diaries Soundtrack Review|accessdate=2007-10-23 |format= |work=Sputnikmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; It peaked at #2 on the [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt; The album was released on August 21, 2007. It has sold 344,000 copies to date in the U.S. as of May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Titus, Christa. [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471690/sixx-am-redefines-beauty-on-this-is-gonna-hurt "Sixx:A.M.

''The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack'', noted by many for showcasing a more emotional sound than, and a musical departure from Sixx's other band, [[Mötley Crüe]], has been received very positively. Jim Kaz of [[IGN]], praising the emotional lyrics of the album, called it "not really an album but rather a musical book. It is almost impossible to recommend any specific songs over others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/817/817320p1.html |title=Sixx: A.M. - The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack Review |author=Jim Kaz |date=August 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628224150/http://music.ign.com/articles/817/817320p1.html |archivedate=June 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
The original code-name for the project was ''Earthlings'', a rarely-used slang term for lesbians.&lt;ref name="curve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curvemag.com/Detailed/296.html |title=Folk Like Us |accessdate=2006-09-03 |author=Schenden, Laurie K. |date= |work=Curve Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506071922/http://www.curvemag.com/Detailed/296.html |archivedate=May 6, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary use of the phrase "the L word" as an alias for ''lesbian'' dates to at least the 1981 play ''[[My Blue Heaven (play)|My Blue Heaven]]'' by [[Jane Chambers]], in which a character stammers out: "You're really...?  The L-word?  Lord God, I never met one before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bailey | first = Lucille M. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Still More on "X-Word" | journal = American Speech | volume = 70 | issue = 2 | pages = 222–223 | publisher = Duke University Press| year = 1995 | doi =  10.2307/455820| id =| jstor = 455820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical use of "the L word" as code language can also be found in the sentence of a letter written{{when|date=August 2014}} by [[Daphne du Maurier]] to [[Ellen Doubleday]]:  "By God and by Christ, if anyone should call that love by that unattractive word that begins with 'L', I'd tear their guts out." &lt;ref&gt;''Daphne du Maurier: The Secret Life of the Renowned Storyteller'', by Margaret Forster (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

Marina relentlessly pursues Jenny and succeeds in destroying her relationship with Tim. The season also introduces [[Shane McCutcheon]], an androgynous, highly sexual hairstylist and serial heart-breaker; [[Alice Pieszecki]], a girly, bisexual journalist looking for love in any way she can, and [[Dana Fairbanks]], a professional tennis player who is still in the closet and torn between pursuing her career and finding love.  In the first season, Dana falls for a [[sous chef]] named [[Lara Perkins]] whose sexuality is questioned by the group until Lara has an unexpected meeting with Dana in the locker room.
At the end of the season, Tina sees Bette and Candace touching hands and speaking intimately and immediately guesses about their affair. Tina and Bette break up, with Tina living at Alice's and Bette stays in their home.

===Season 2===
{{main|The L Word (season 2)}}
Season 2 began airing on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on February 20, 2005 and featured thirteen episodes.  It starts by unveiling to the viewers a secret Tina is keeping from everyone: she successfully became impregnated after a second insemination. Tina and Bette are still apart. Bette doesn't deny the affair and begs Tina for forgiveness but later alienates herself from the group and continues the affair for a short while until realizing that it's Tina she wants to spend her life with not Candace and so ends their short affair. Tina begins seeing [[Helena Peabody|Helena]], while Bette’s life is portrayed as a wreck, with alcohol abuse, problems with her job, the death of her father in episode 2.12:''L'Chaim'', and being fired during the season finale.  Tina and Bette reconcile during the final episode.  The character of Marina was written out of the show, and the Planet was bought by [[Kit Porter]].&lt;ref name="Episode 2.02"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=123809| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309035929/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=123809| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-09| title=Lap Dance| accessdate=2007-02-01| author=m| date=2005-02-27| work=Showtime}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Introduced in the second season are [[Carmen de la Pica Morales]], a confident DJ who becomes part of a [[love triangle]] with Shane and Jenny; [[Helena Peabody]], the daughter of a wealthy supporter of the arts who later becomes Tina's love interest; and [[Mark Wayland]], a documentary filmmaker who moves in with Shane and Jenny.  Mark makes them part of his latest documentary by setting up hidden cameras in the house to videotape them.  During episode 2.09: ''Late, Later, Latent'', Jenny discovers Mark’s tapes and also discovers the truth about Carmen’s true love.

Season 2 introduces a developing affair between Alice and Dana, which becomes public in episode 2.07: ''Luminous''.  It also presents insights into Jenny’s past as an abused child in episode 2.11: ''Loud and Proud'', and reveals episodes of self-harm that reach their climax in the season finale.

===Season 3===
{{main|The L Word (season 3)}}
The television show set up  contest at the website FanLib.com where fans could submit a femme slash fanfic.  The winner's story was incorporated into a scene of a third-season episode.&lt;ref&gt;Hibberd, James (December 5, 2005), "Lights! Camera! 'L Word' Action!". ''Television Week''. '''24''' (49):4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(December 5, 2005), "At Deadline".''MediaWeek''. '''15''' (44):3&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 3 first aired on January 8, 2006, with 12 episodes. It begins six months after the birth of Tina and Bette's daughter, Angelica. New characters in this season include [[Moira/Max Sweeney|Moira Sweeney]] (a working class butch portrayed by [[Daniela Sea]] who is Jenny’s girlfriend for most of the season) and Angus Partridge (portrayed by [[Dallas Roberts]]), Angelica’s male [[nanny]] who later becomes Kit's lover.&lt;ref name="Episode 3.06"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125210| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309001527/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125210| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-09| title=Lifesize.| accessdate=2007-01-25| author=| date=2006-02-12| work=Showtime}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweeney starts the process of [[transgender|transitioning]] switching his name to Max.

Notable of this season is that each episode begins with a short pre-credits vignette of two individuals meeting romantically or sexually. As the season progresses, lines from Alice's chart (''[[The L Word#The Chart|see below]]'') connect one member of each vignette with a new individual in the next.

Helena's character storyline was switched from being Bette's rival into a new member of the circle of friends. Her story arc for the season involves the acquisition of a movie studio&lt;ref name="Episode 3.01"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125205| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309001518/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125205| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-09| title=Labia Majora| accessdate=2007-01-25| author=| date=2006-01-08| work=Showtime}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Tina later works,&lt;ref name="Episode 3.03"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125207| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308110910/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125207| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-08| title=Lobsters| accessdate=2007-01-25| author=| date=2006-01-22| work=Showtime}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which further derives a [[sexual harassment]] [[lawsuit]]&lt;ref name="Episode 3.09"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125212| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309040131/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=125212| dead-url=yes| archive-date=2007-03-09| title=Lead, follow, or get out of the way| accessdate=2007-01-25| author=| date=2006-03-05| work=Showtime}}&lt;/ref&gt; that triggers her mother to cut her off financially in the season finale. Sarah Shahi's character, Carmen, ends her appearance in the show in the finale when Shane leaves her at the altar.

Production began in Vancouver the summer of 2007 and ended in Los Angeles early November 2007. The fifth season premiered on January 6, 2008, with episode ''LGB Tease''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Five Times the Love! Lust! Laughs! Longing!

===Season 6===
{{main|The L Word (season 6)}}
Showtime confirmed a sixth and final season for ''The L Word''. Unlike the show's previous seasons, it only lasted 8 episodes to conclude the show with 71 episodes in total. Studio executives commented on the longevity of the show, with the Showtime president of entertainment Robert Greenblatt saying that ''The L Word'' has "surpassed its niche as a gay show". The sixth season premiered on January 18, 2009 and ended its original run on March 8 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003722311 | title=Showtime will have last 'Word' }} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producers and writers of ''The L Word'' took viewers' opinions regarding the final season’s episodes. The main story of the season is related to the death of [[Jennifer Schecter]] and the rest of the season is a flashback from that point.

Before airing the show, Creator Ilene Chaiken denied reports of socialite [[Paris Hilton]] guest starring on an interview on gaydarnation.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaydarnation.com/UserPortal/Article/Detail.aspx?ID=21447&amp;sid=64 Ilene Chaiken: L Word] gaydarnation.com, 20 Jun 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Ilene Chaiken said in an interview with the [[New York Post]] Magazine that she had offered DJ [[Samantha Ronson]] a guest spot in Season 6 but Ronson declined as she was busy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20081005/Discuss+Must+Samantha+Ronson+Be+Lesbian+Role+Model Must Samantha Ronson Be A Lesbian Role Model?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402204603/http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20081005/Discuss+Must+Samantha+Ronson+Be+Lesbian+Role+Model |date=2009-04-02 }} NY Post Page Six Magazine Oct 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, it was confirmed that [[Elizabeth Berkley]] would star as Kelly Wentworth (née Freemont) in a [[story arc|multi-episode arc]] of the final season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080828025307/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2008/07/exclusive-berkl.html Exclusive: Elizabeth Berkley Utters 'The L Word'] EW.com Jul 22, 2008 by Michael Ausiello&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meiling Melançon|Mei Melançon]] also made guest appearances for the last season as [[Jamie Chen]], a counselor from the L.A. Gay and Lesbian Youth Center who befriends Alice and Tasha and becomes their third-wheel crush.

===Interrogation tapes===
Shortly after airing the final episode, Showtime began releasing short videos in which characters revealed secrets that weren't revealed during the course of the show. Each video showed the interrogation of one character with a new video being released each Monday after the final episode via the Showtime website. At some point in time Showtime's website ceased carrying the videos, but they can be found on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name=Interrogation&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22L+Word%22+interrogation&amp;aq=f Search for interrogation tapes.] ''[[YouTube]]''&lt;/ref&gt; All episodes feature [[Lucy Lawless]] as Sgt. Marybeth Duffy and [[Sean Tyson]] as Det. Sean Holden who are investigating the death of [[Jenny Schecter]].

Following the seven interrogation tapes (featuring Bette, Tina, Alice, Max, Helena, Niki &amp; Shane), the same URL offered an interview with series creator Ilene Chaiken in two weekly installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sho.com/site/lword/interrogation.do |title=Showtime : The L Word : Home |publisher=Sho.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090629030202/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/interrogation.do |archivedate=2009-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaiken discussed several aspects of the show's history and plotlines, but would only consent to reiterating that Alice went to jail for Jenny's murder while not necessarily being guilty of the crime. Ilene Chaiken and the cast have commented on different theories about Jenny's death.&lt;ref name=death_theories&gt;{{YouTube|pqZT5lOx0IU|Executive Producer Ilene Chaiken and The Cast Comment on different Theories about Jenny's death}}.

==Unaired spin-off series and film proposals==
Series creator [[Ilene Chaiken]] wrote and produced a 20-minute presentation for a possible spin-off centering on another lesbian group in a women's prison where [[Leisha Hailey]]'s character [[Alice Pieszecki]] is detained. ''The Farm'' started shooting in December 2008, while the sixth and final season of ''The L Word'' premiered in January 2009. [[Famke Janssen]], [[Melissa Leo]] and [[Laurie Metcalf]] were part of the cast.

Showtime's CEO Matthew Blank announced plans for the new show at the [[Television Critics Association]] press tour in July 2008.&lt;ref name="BuddyTV The L-Word Sixth Season"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-l-word/the-l-word-set-to-come-back-in-23364.aspx| title='The L Word' Set to Come Back in January Next Year| accessdate=2009-02-26| author=Valerie Anne del Castillo| date=2008-10-06| work=Showtime| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226233919/http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-l-word/the-l-word-set-to-come-back-in-23364.aspx| archive-date=2009-02-26| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced in April that Showtime declined to pick up ''The Farm'' as a series, which may leave the open-ended element of the series finale as permanently unresolved.&lt;ref name="BuShowtime passes on ''L Word'' spinoff (whew!) and Matthew Perry series (sniff!)"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2009/04/l-word-spinoff.html| title=Showtime passes on ''L Word'' spinoff (whew!) and Matthew Perry series (sniff!)| accessdate=2009-04-03| author=Annie Barrett| date=2009-04-03| work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaiken has expressed interest in producing a film based on the series in an interview aired through ''The L Word'''s website, although according to her declarations, it probably would not emphasize any of the unresolved plot lines of the show and would simply continue the story of the characters' friendships.  No official proposals or green-lighting related to an ''L Word'' film have been publicized.

==''The Real L Word''==
Chaiken continued ''The L Word'' franchise with the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] series ''[[The Real L Word]]'', debuting June 20, 2010.  The reality series followed the lives of six lesbians in Los Angeles.  In an interview for the new series, Chaiken revealed Alice did not kill Jenny in the original series.&lt;ref name="TVG"&gt;{{cite web

==Music==
{{main|List of The L Word soundtracks}}
As of March 2008, ''The L Word'' has released five compilation CDs with the show's soundtrack. The music composer of the show is [[EZgirl]]. The music supervisor is [[Natasha Duprey]].

All three of [[Leisha Hailey]]'s bands have been referenced in the series. A song by [[The Murmurs]], Hailey's first band, was used in a first-season episode and included on that season's soundtrack.   During the second season, the character Shane is sometimes seen wearing a T-shirt for [[Gush (band)|Gush]], Hailey's second band. Songs of Hailey's most recent band, [[Uh Huh Her (band)|Uh Huh Her]], were featured during the show's fifth and sixth seasons; the character Tasha Williams is seen wearing an Uh Huh Her T-shirt during the sixth season.

==The Chart==
{{see also|Six degrees of separation}}
[[File:The chart.png|thumb|250px|A small portion of The Chart, covering some of the relationships established along the series through Season 6. Pink represents main female characters, blue represents main male characters, purple and green minor characters featured in the series (female and male respectively), and grey signifies characters that are only alluded to.]]
"The Chart" is a graph of the affairs that occur among Alice's friends and acquaintances; it is an [[undirected graph|undirected labeled graph]] in which nodes are labeled with people's names and the lines represent affairs or hookups. 
Originally, ''The L Word'' was to be based around a lesbian [[Kit Porter]], and "The Chart" was tattooed on her back.&lt;ref name="curve"/&gt; When Kit Porter was changed into a straight character, The Chart was given to Alice instead.

The Chart is a recurrent element in the show's storylines, especially those related to its creator within the series.&lt;ref name = NYTimes&gt;Elizabeth Jensen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/18/technology/18chart.html "‘The L Word’ Spins Off Its Chart"], ''[[NY Times]]'', 2006-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; During Season 3, it also serves as a marginal storyline that advances through each episode and concludes in the season finale – as well as a way to track the characters and get to know how they interact within the lesbian community.

The Concept of The Chart was further exploited in Season Four. Within the series, The Chart evolves into an internet social network hosting profiles and provides the introduction for the character of Papi in Episode 4.01:''Legend in the Making''. At the same time, a real-world parallel project OurChart.com was launched.&lt;ref name = OurChart&gt;Pete Cashmore, [http://mashable.com/2006/12/18/ourchartcom-the-l-word-launching-lesbian-social-network/ "OurChart.com – The L-Word Launching Lesbian Social Network"], ''[[Mashable]]'', 2006-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The website, which allowed registered members to create their own profiles and also hosted several blogs on the show, was fully operational until the launch of the Sixth Season, after which Ilene Chaiken announced through an online statement that OurChart.com had merged with Showtime's website.&lt;ref name=OurChartMerge&gt;Ilene Chaiken, [http://www.sho.com/site/lword/popup.do?content=ourchart_info "A New Year A New OurChart"] {{webarchive |url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090629024038/http://www.sho.com/site/lword/popup.do?content=ourchart_info |date=June 29, 2009 }}, ''[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The show's first season was "broadcast to critical acclaim and instant popularity"; as an article from ''[[The New York Times]]'' pointed out:&lt;ref name="nyt2005"&gt;{{cite news| title=She Likes to Watch| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/06/arts/television/06gloc.html?pagewanted=all| date=February 6, 2005| author=[[Alison Glock]]| accessdate=2009-03-16| publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Before "The L Word," lesbian characters barely existed in television. Interested viewers had to search and second-guess, playing parlor games to suss out a character's sexuality. [[Cagney &amp; Lacey|Cagney and Lacey]]? Jo on "[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|Facts of Life]]"? [[Xena]] and [[Gabrielle (Xena: Warrior Princess)|Gabrielle]]? Showtime's decision in January 2004 to air ''The L Word'', which follows the lives of a group of fashionable Los Angeles lesbians, was akin to ending a drought with a monsoon. Women who had rarely seen themselves on the small screen were suddenly able to watch lesbian characters not only living complex, exciting lives, but also making love in restaurant bathrooms and in swimming pools. There was no tentative audience courtship. Instead there was sex, raw and unbridled in that my-goodness way that only cable allows.

Co-creator and executive producer [[Ilene Chaiken]] had some issues with the reaction:&lt;ref name="nyt2005"/&gt;
:I do want to move people on some deep level. But I won't take on the mantle of social responsibility. That's not compatible with entertainment. I rail against the idea that pop television is a political medium. I am political in my life. But I am making serialized [[melodrama]]. I'm not a cultural missionary.

While the show is seen as fulfilling lesbians' "obvious and modest representational need"&lt;ref&gt;Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, "Foreword: The Letter L." ''Reading the L Word'', edited by Kim Akass and Janet McCabe. London: I. B. Tauris (2006): xix&lt;/ref&gt; or even the "ferocious desire not only to be seen in some literal sense... but to be seen with all the blood and angst and magic that you possess",&lt;ref&gt;Dana Heller, "How Does a Lesbian Look? Stendhal's Syndrome and the L Word." ''Reading the L Word'', edited by Kim Akass and Janet McCabe. London: I. B. Tauris (2006): 57&lt;/ref&gt; the show has been criticized for various scenes which serve to "reify [[heteronormativity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Chambers, "Heteronormativity and ''The L Word'': From Politics of Representation to a Politics of Norms" ''Reading the L Word'', edited by Kim Akass and Janet McCabe. London: I. B. Tauris (2006): 91&lt;/ref&gt; The show has also been praised for its nuanced consideration (in the first season) of how and in what ways lesbians should stand up to the religious right, with the "Provocations" art show storyline being "a fictionalized version of what happened when Cincinnati's Contemporary Art Center booked a controversial exhibition of Mapplethorpe photographs in 1990".&lt;ref&gt;Margaret McFadden, ""We cannot afford to keep being so high-minded": Fighting the Religious Right on ''The L Word''" ''The New Queer Aesthetic on Television: Essays on Recent Programming'', edited by James R. Keller and Leslie Stratyner. Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers (2006): 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike its network predecessor ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', praised critically for its ground-breaking material that was both well-written and well-acted, there have been complaints from critics regarding ''The L Word'''s watered-down, unrealistically glamorous characters and melodrama. Some reviewers (and fans) are put off by the theme song (introduced in the second season) and the "graceless, clunky dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;Heather Havrilesky, "[http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/review/2007/01/14/iltw/index2.html I Like to Watch]" salon.com, January 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Several shows have referenced ''The L Word'', including ''[[South of Nowhere]]'''s first season episode "Girls Guide to Dating"; ''[[According to Jim]]''; the medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''; the first season finale of ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'', [[Jon Stewart]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' (July 24, 2006); ''[[Chappelle's Show#The "Lost Episodes"|Chappelle's Show: The "Lost Episodes"]]''; ''[[The Sopranos]]'' episode ''[[Live Free or Die (The Sopranos)|Live Free or Die]]''; the US version of ''[[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]]''; ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'' fourth season episode ''Scene in a Mall''; ''[[The Big Gay Sketch Show]]''; ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[You Kent Always Say What You Want]]''; and ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode ''[[Brian Sings and Swings]]''. Also, movies such as ''[[Puccini for Beginners]]'' and ''[[I Can't Think Straight]]'' have made mention of ''The L Word'' as to reference lesbians.

By the time the sixth and final season began, ''The New York Times'' was calling the show a "[[History of lesbianism|Sapphic]] ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]]" that has "shown little interest in variegating portrayals of gay experience. Instead it has seemed to work almost single-mindedly to counter the notion of "[[lesbian bed death]]" and repeatedly remind the viewer of the "limits and tortures of monogamy" while "never align[ing] itself with the traditionalist ambitions [for [[same-sex marriage]]] of a large faction of the gay rights movement".&lt;ref name="nyt2009"&gt;{{cite news| title=So Many Temptations to Succumb to, So Many Wandering Eyes to Track| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/arts/television/16word.html?fta=y| author=[[Ginia Bellafante]]| accessdate=2009-03-16| publisher=The New York Times | date=2009-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 2006, [[Laurel Holloman]] won a [[Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama]] for her portrayal of [[Tina Kennard]]; the [[International Press Academy]] also nominated the show for a [[Satellite Award for Best Television Series – Drama]].  In the second season, [[Ossie Davis]] received a posthumous [[57th Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor – Drama Series|Outstanding Guest Actor in a drama series]] in recognition of his portrayal of the father of [[Bette Porter|Bette]] and [[Kit Porter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001115/awards?ref_=nm_awd "Ossie Davis - Awards," IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt; The show received multiple nominations for [[GLAAD Media Awards]] and both [[Pam Grier]] and [[Jennifer Beals]] were repeatedly nominated for [[NAACP Image Awards]].

In 2008 ''The L Word'''s companion website was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award]]s for Outstanding Achievement in Advanced Media Technology for Best Use of Commercial Advertising on Personal Computers.

==Plot==
In late 19th-century New Mexico, Samuel Jones reappears hoping to reconcile with his adult daughter Magdalena "Maggie" Gilkeson. She is unable to forgive him for abandoning the family and leaving her mother to a hard life and early death. This situation changes when Pesh-Chidin and a dozen of his followers (who have left the reservation) pass through the area, ritualistically killing settlers and taking their daughters to be sold into sex slavery in Mexico. Among those captured is Maggie's eldest daughter, Lilly. Maggie's rancher boyfriend Brake Baldwin was among the settlers killed. 

The [[U.S. Cavalry]] refuses to help retrieve the captive women as its resources are tied up conducting forced relocation of captive [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. This leaves Maggie, her father, and her younger daughter Dot alone in tracking the attackers. The group unexpectedly meets up with Kayitah, a [[Chiricahua]], and an old friend of Jones, who also happens to be tracking the attackers with his son Honesco, because among the captives is a young Chiricahua woman who is engaged to Honesco. After the two agree to join the group, and Maggie treats Honesco's injuries, Kayitah informs Maggie that Jones had been a member of their Chiricahua band where he gained the name Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan ("shit for luck") during his wanderings.

It is finally with the combined efforts of the two families that they are able to free the women, at the cost of Kayitah's life, and immediately flee to the mountains with the kidnappers behind them. Knowing they have no other choice but to stand their ground, the group fights off the remaining kidnappers. During the battle, Jones fights El Brujo, the one responsible for kidnapping his granddaughter. When Brujo attempts to kill Maggie with a shotgun, Jones sacrifices his life to save his daughter as both he and Brujo fall off a cliff to their deaths. Maggie shoots at the last remaining kidnappers to scare them off. She realizes her father's love for her and finally forgives him.

Then she goes home with her father’s body, her daughters and the other kidnapped girls.

==Reception==
The film earned mixed reviews from critics, earning it a 58% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with the general consensus being: "an expertly acted and directed Western.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5798">'''Theater Breaking Through Barriers (TBTB)''', formerly '''[http://tbtb.org/ Theater By the Blind]''', is an [[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusive]] [[theater company]] in [[New York City]] that strives develop the talents of individuals with disabilities for work onstage, backstage, in the office and in the audience.&lt;ref name="TBTB-intro"/&gt;  It was founded in 1979 by Ike Schambelan(who died of cancer in 2015), with sighted actors recording plays for the blind.  The theater then moved to performances for the blind and then blind performances for the sighted.&lt;ref name="New York Day by Day: Explaining Blindness"/&gt; They recently began doing a short play festival each year.

==Crystal Clear==
''Crystal Clear'' by [[Phil Young (playwright)|Phil Young]] opened in 1986 at the [[Long Wharf Theater]]'s Stage II.  The show starred (George Ashiotis) who played a young actor who is gradually going blind from diabetes and his girlfriend who has been blind from birth (Lucia Puccia) .  ''Crystal Clear'' began as an improvisation on a [[London]] pub stage in 1982.

The production had mixed reviews from critics. Mel Gusso said for The New York Times, "It is diagnostic rather than psychologically probing."&lt;ref name="crystal"/&gt;  Another critic said the play was "a wildly unfocused work that tries to cover too vast a terrain" and that it contained "a cornucopia of cliches".&lt;ref name="sentimental"/&gt;

==A Midsummer Night's Dream==
''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] staged at the Barrow Group Theater in [[Manhattan]], was the first play by TBTB to feature a character in a wheelchair:
{{Quote|text=It holds Ann Marie Morelli, an actress playing Hermia, who at first has the attention of one too many men but later finds herself with the attention of one too few. Hermia, as created by Shakespeare, is short, and her rival in love, Helena (Erin O’Leary), is tall. Through the centuries poor Hermia has always taken a verbal beating for her physique, but here it has a different bite.

"Get you gone, you dwarf, you minimus," barks Lysander, who once doted on her. And Hermia herself laments, "My legs can keep no pace with my desires."
 |sign=Neil Genzlinger&lt;ref name="Actors Who See With More Than Their Eyes"/&gt; |source=New York Times
}}
A note in the theater program said, "Increasingly we feel we must include all disabled people [rather than blind people only] in our work."&lt;ref name="Actors Who See With More Than Their Eyes"/&gt; To reflect this shift in thought and philosophy, 2008 saw the company changing its name from Theater By The Blind to Theater Breaking Through Barriers.&lt;ref name="Theater by the Blind Changes Name"/&gt; Productions, such as Romeo &amp; Juliet, closely followed featuring an actor, Gregg Mozgala,  with Cerebral Palsy, their first in a subsequent line of productions incorporating actors with various disabilities.

'''''Time Transfixed''''' ('''''La Durée poignardée''''') is an [[Oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting by the Belgian [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]]. It is part of the permanent collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and is usually on display in the museum's new Modern Wing.&lt;ref name ="AIC1"&gt;{{cite web

The painting was one of many done for surrealist patron and Magritte supporter [[Edward James]]. This was the second painting delivered to James for his London ballroom. The first was the portrait of James, ''[[Not to be Reproduced]]''.&lt;ref name ="AIC2"&gt;{{cite web

The painting depicts an [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]{{cn|date=January 2016}} [[4-6-0|4-6-0 Locomotive]] jutting out of a [[fireplace]], at full steam, in an empty room. Above the mantelpiece is a tall mirror. Only the clock and one candlestick standing on the mantelpiece are reflected in the [[mirror]].&lt;ref name="AIC2" /&gt;

==The artist's perspective==
The title of the painting translates to English literally as '''''Ongoing Time Stabbed by a Dagger''''', and Magritte was reportedly unhappy with the generally accepted translation of ''Time Transfixed''.&lt;ref name="AMICA"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.davidrumsey.com/amica/amico649500-5784.html

 | access-date = 24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte hoped that James would hang the painting at the base of his staircase so that the train would "stab" guests on their way up to the ballroom. James instead chose to hang the painting above his own fireplace.&lt;ref name="AIC2" /&gt;

Magritte described his motivation for this painting:
:"I decided to paint the image of a locomotive... In order for its mystery to be evoked, another ''immediately'' familiar image without mystery—the image of a dining room fireplace—was joined."&lt;ref name="AIC2" /&gt;

The memorial is in the churchyard Burial Ground of the [[Old Presbyterian Meeting House]], a congregation of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] that dates from 1772. The Meeting House is located at 323 South Fairfax Street, in [[Alexandria Historic District|Alexandria's Old Town National Historic Landmark District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legion.org/magazine/64818/unknown-revolutionary|publisher=[[American Legion]]|title=The Unknown Revolutionary|date=October 28, 2011|author=Christopher Lancette|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2012/11/13/less-known-unknown|publisher=[[WETA-TV]]|title=The Less-Known Unknown|author=Will Hughes|date=November 13, 2012|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of the memorial==

In 1826, during construction of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, which is located immediately next to the churchyard of the Old Presbyterian Meeting House, the body of an unidentified man, clothed in a Revolutionary War uniform, was unearthed. The body was then reinterred within the current bounds of the Meeting House Burial Ground. The memory that the remains of an unidentified soldier had been reburied at this site was carried into the twentieth century by Mary Gregory Powell (1847-1928), a member of the Meeting House congregation and long-time historian of the Mount Vernon chapter of the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]]. Her father, William Gregory (1789-1875), had come to Alexandria from Scotland in 1807 and had served the Presbyterian Meeting House congregation for many years as an Elder and member of the Church Committee. Mary Gregory had placed flowers on the unmarked grave of the unidentified soldier as a child.

Several events during the 1920s influenced the creation of this memorial to an Unknown of the American Revolution. One was the memorialization of soldiers who had died in [[World War I]] and remained unidentified. On the second anniversary of the signing of the treaty that ended World War I, [[Armistice Day]] 1920, memorials to unknown soldiers were dedicated in [[Great Britain]] and [[France]]. The [[United States]] dedicated its memorial to an unknown soldier of that war at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on November 11, 1921. The sarcophagus-style monument that now sits atop the burial vault of the [[Tomb of the Unknowns]] was added in 1932.

The 1920s also witnessed a surge of interest in honoring and preserving the nation's colonial heritage. Alexandria's earliest Colonial revival preservation effort was the restoration of the Presbyterian Meeting House, which began in 1925. As that project drew to its completion, Mary Gregory Powell contacted John B. Gordon, chair of the Meeting House restoration committee, about honoring the Unknown Soldier. The decision was made to formally mark the gravesite. Leadership in that task was provided by Alexandria's [[American Legion]] Post No. 24.

On February 22, 1928, a temporary marker was placed at the gravesite in conjunction with Alexandria's annual celebration of [[Washington's Birthday|George Washington's birthday]]. Dedication services held that day followed traditions in Alexandria that date from its colonial period – participants initially gathered at [[Gadsby's Tavern]] and then joined in a processional walk through the city's streets to the Meeting House, where the service was conducted. Mary Gregory Powell dedicated the initial wooden temporary marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alexandria Services by C.A.R.

==Dedication of the memorial==

The current memorial was created by the National Society of the [[Children of the American Revolution]] under the leadership of Mrs. Josiah A. Van Orsdel, the Society's president. The memorial was dedicated on Lexington-Concord Day, April 19, 1929, with services in the Presbyterian Meeting House and at the site of the memorial in the churchyard Burial Ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=51968|publisher=[[Alexandria, Virginia]]|title=Historic Cemeteries of Alexandria|date=November 2, 2016|accessdate=April 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service in the Meeting House was led by Mrs. Van Orsdel and included two addresses – "Story of the Discovery of the Grave," by John B. Gordon, chair of the Meeting House restoration committee, and "157,000 American Unknown War Dead Here and Abroad," by James W. Good, U.S. Secretary of War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good, James W.

Music was provided by the U.S. Army Band, which joined with the church's historic 1849 Erben organ to lead the singing of the Star Spangled Banner. Following the service inside the Meeting House, the assemblage moved to the gravesite, accompanied by the solemn tolling of the church bell, where numerous wreaths were placed at the foot of the memorial by patriotic and military organizations. The 90-minute program was broadcast live national audience by Washington's local radio station, [[WTEM#WRC Radio|WRC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Honors for Soldier of Revolution|newspaper=Alexandria Gazette|date=April 16, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stone Unveiled to an Unknown Soldier|newspaper=Alexandria Gazette|date=April 20, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dedication of Unknown Tomb Today|newspaper=Washington Post|location=Washington, D.C.|date=April 19, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9801E6DF1530E33ABC4851DFB2668382639EDE&amp;legacy=true|title=Good Dedicates Shaft to Soldier of 1776|newspaper=New York Times|location=New York, NY|date=April 20, 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text of the Epitaph==

{{blockquote|Here lies a soldier of the Revolution whose identity is known but to God.  His was an idealism that recognized a Supreme Being, that planted religious liberty on our shores, that overthrew despotism, that established a people's government, that wrote a Constitution setting metes and bounds of delegated authority, that fixed a standard of value upon men above gold and lifted high the torch of civil liberty along the pathway of mankind. In ourselves his soul exists as part of ours, his memory's mansion.}}

'''Truth claim''', in photography, is a term [[Tom Gunning]] uses to describe the prevalent belief that traditional photographs accurately depict reality. He states that the truth claim relies on both the [[indexicality]] and visual accuracy of photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indexicality==
[[Charles Peirce]]'s term 'indexicality' refers to the physical relationship between the object photographed and the resulting image.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|pp=39–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Levinson]] emphasises the ability of photography to capture or reflect "a literal energy configuration from the real world" through a chemical process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light sensitive emulsion on the [[Negative (photography)|photographic negative]] is transformed by light passing [[Through-the-lens|through the lens]] and diaphragm of a camera.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levinson relates this characteristic of the photograph to its objectivity and reliability, echoing Andre Bazin's belief that photography is free from the "sin" of subjectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|pp=40, 41, 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar argument has been made for motion pictures by Stephen Maguire. [[Lev Manovich]] labels cinema ''the art of the index'', its traditional identity lying in its ability to capture reality.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;{{cite web |author=Lev Manovich |title=What is digital cinema? |url=http://www.manovich.net/text/digital-cinema |year=1995 |accessdate=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis McQuail]] likewise argues that film is capable of manipulating the "...seeming reality of the photographic message without loss of credibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McQuail|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual accuracy==
Gunning states that a photograph must also have "iconicity". To represent "truth" it must resemble the object it represents, which is not an inevitable characteristic of an index.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

==Consequences of the "truth claim"==

===For individuals===
Levinson suggests that icons have a powerful effect on individuals, particularly the "direct image" due to the "sheer ease and [[sensual]] satisfaction" of viewing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|pp=37, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunning attributes the human fascination with photographs with a sense of the relationship between photography and reality, though he claims that the "perceptual richness and nearly infinite detail" of the image itself is more significant than a knowledge of its indexicality. He cites Bazin's idea that photography has an "irrational power to bear away our [[faith]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Gunning|2004|pp=45–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Susan Sontag]] relates the belief in a photograph's ability to capture 'reality' to the development of certain human practices. Since a picture confers on events "a kind of immortality (and importance) it would never otherwise have enjoyed,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; she explains, the act of taking photographs has become essential to the experience of [[Travel|world travel]]. The possibility of 'true' photographs leads to a compulsion to "[convert] experience into an image" to "make real what one is experiencing."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For society===

====Understanding of reality====
David Croteau and William Hoynes suggest that the prevalence of photographic images has blurred the distinction between image and reality, referring to ''pseudo-events'', in Daniel Boorstin's words – such as [[News conference|press conferences]], televised political debates, or 'photo opportunities' - that exist only to create images.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Croteau|Hoynes|2003|pp=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Neil Postman]] argues that the photograph has redefined society's understanding of information and truth: "Truth is in the seeing, not in the thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Croteau|Hoynes|2003|p=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postman suggests that the proliferation of photography led to the replacement of language with images as "our dominant means for constructing, understanding, and testing reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Postman|1993|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sontag shares this view, suggesting that "the 'realistic' view of the world compatible with bureaucracy redefines knowledge as ''techniques of information''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social organisation====
In Sontag's view, a consequence of photography becoming a primary means for understanding reality is the emergence of "[[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] cataloguing". She claims that photography's perceived ability to give information results in the bureaucratic organization of modern states. Institutions of control, such as the police, are able to survey and control "increasingly mobile populations" through photographic documents, such as passports or identity cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=5, 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Desensitization====
Sontag also argues that through repeatedly capturing and viewing reality through photographs, their subjects can become less real. She claims that "aesthetic distance seems built into the very experience of looking at photographs," and also that the sheer volume of horrific images throughout the world has produced a "familiarity with atrocity, making the horrible seem more ordinary – making it appear familiar, remote … inevitable".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hyperreality====
Sontag's view is akin to Jean Baudrillard's theory of 'hyperreality', where "reality itself founders" as a result of an endless "reduplication of the real" via media such as photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baudrillard|2001|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims that the possibility of infinite identical objects creates a "relationship of equivalence, of indifference,"...leading to the "extinction of the original."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baudrillard|2001|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital photography==

It has been argued that the digitisation of photography undermines its ''truth claim''.

===Potential for manipulation===
Levinson suggests that the digitisation of photography undermines "the very reliability of the photograph as mute, unbiased witness of reality"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the fallibility of [[photo manipulation|technological manipulation]] and the potential for human refinement of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levinson|1997|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lev Manovich likewise questions the indexical identity of motion pictures, rather labelling cinema a [[Genre|subgenre]] of painting, since it is possible to digitally modify frames, generate photorealistic images entirely using 3-D [[computer animation]], and "...to cut, bend, stretch and stitch digitised film images into something which has perfect photographic credibility, although it was never actually filmed."&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;

===Loss of indexicality===
It has also been argued that digital photographs inevitably lack indexicality, based on an understanding of "crucial distinctions between the analogue and the digital" in the way they record 'reality'.&lt;ref name="Lister_252"&gt;{{harvp|Lister|2007|p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Frosh describes photographs as "codes without a message" – "repurposable visual content made of malleable info-pixels."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lister|2007|p=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The continuing "reality effect"===
Gunning alternatively argues that [[digital photography]], the process of encoding data about light in a matrix of numbers, is indexically determined by objects outside of the camera like chemical photography.&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

Likewise, Martin Lister claims that even with a [[digital camera]], "The images produced are rendered [[Photorealism|photo-realistic]], they borrow photography's currency, its deeply historical 'reality effect', simply in order to have meaning."&lt;ref name="Lister_252"/&gt;

==Criticism of the "truth claim"==
[[Susan Sontag]] challenges the "presumption of veracity" associated with photographs, arguing that they are "...as much an interpretation of the world as paintings and drawings are." She describes the role of the photographer in determining the exposure, light, texture and geometry of a photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunning points to the physicality of the camera as a mediator between the photograph and reality. He notes that the use of a lens, film, a particular exposure, kind of shutter, and developing process "...become magically whisked away if one considers the photograph as a direct imprint of reality."&lt;ref name="Gunning_40"/&gt;

Sontag also describes the inability of a photograph to capture enough information about its subject to be considered a representation of reality. She states, "The camera's rendering of reality must always hide more than it discloses…only what which narrates can make us understand."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Sontag|1977|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, [[Roland Barthes]] notes that the [[Research subject|human subject]] can be made less real through the process of being photographed. He notes, "Once I feel myself observed by the lens, everything changes: I constitute myself in the process of 'posing', I instantaneously make another body for myself, transform myself in advance into an image."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Barthes|1982|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Porter|Kennedy|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
