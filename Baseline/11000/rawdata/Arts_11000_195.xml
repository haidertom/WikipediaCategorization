'''Fashion in the period 1660–1700''' in [[Western Europe]]an [[clothing]] is characterized by rapid change. The style of this era is known as Baroque. Following the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] and the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of [[England's]] [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], military influences in men's clothing were replaced by a brief period of decorative exuberance which then sobered into the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] costume that would reign for the next century and a half. In the normal cycle of fashion, the broad, high-waisted silhouette of the [[1600–1650 in fashion|previous period]] was replaced by a long, lean line with a low waist for both men and women. This period also marked the rise of the [[Wig (hair)|periwig]] as an essential item of men's fashion.


== Women's fashion ==
[[File:Portrait of Suzanna Doublet-Huygens by Caspar Netscher.jpg|thumb|right|Susanna Huygens wore a long, tight white satin bodice with paned sleeves lined in pink and a matching petticoat. Her hair is worn in a mass of tight curls, and she wears pearl eardrops and a pearl necklace. 1667–69.]]
[[File:Barbara Palmer (née Villiers), Duchess of Cleveland by John Michael Wright.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Barbara Palmer, 1st Duchess of Cleveland|Barbara Viliers]], mistress of King Charles II, painted by [[John Michael Wright]] c. 1670 in the romantic style.]]

=== Overview ===
The wide, high-waisted look of the [[1600–1650 in fashion|previous period]] was gradually superseded by a long vertical line, with horizontal emphasis at the shoulder. Full, loose [[sleeve]]s ended just below the elbow at mid century and became longer and tighter in keeping with the new trend. The body was tightly [[corset]]ed, with a low, broad neckline and dropped shoulder. In later decades, the [[overskirt]] was drawn back and pinned up to display the [[petticoat]], which was heavily decorated.

Spanish court fashion remained out of step with the fashions that arose in France and England, and prosperous [[Holland]] also retained its own modest fashions, especially in headdress and hairstyles, as it had retained the [[ruff (clothing)|ruff]] in the previous period.

=== Romantic negligence ===
A daring new fashion arose for having one's portrait painted in ''undress'', wearing a loosely fastened [[gown]] called a ''nightgown'' over a voluminous [[chemise]], with tousled curls. The style is epitomized by the portraits of [[Peter Lely]], which derive from the romanticized style originated by [[Anthony van Dyck]] in the 1630s. The clothing in these portraits is not representative of what was worn on the street or at court.&lt;ref&gt;Gordenker, ''Van Dyck and the Representation of Dress in Seventeenth-Century Portraiture''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Marly, "Undress in the Œuvre of Lely"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mantua ===
The ''[[mantua (clothing)|mantua]]'' or ''manteau'' was a new fashion that arose in the 1680s. Instead of a bodice and skirt cut separately, the mantua hung from the shoulders to the floor (in the manner of dresses of earlier periods) started off as the female version of the men's [[Banyan (clothing)|Banyan]], worn for 'undress' wear. Gradually it developed into a draped and pleated dress and eventually evolved into a dress worn looped and draped up over a contrasting petticoat and a stomacher. The mantua-and-stomacher resulted in a high, square neckline in contrast to the broad, off-the-shoulder neckline previously in fashion. The new look was both more modest and covered-up than previous fashions and decidedly fussy, with bows, frills, ribbons, and other trim, but the short string of pearls and pearl earrings or ''eardrops'' worn since the 1630s remained popular.

The mantua, made from a single length of fabric pleated to fit with a long train, was ideal for showing the designs of the new elaborately patterned silks that replaced the solid-colored satins popular in mid-century.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro, Aileen, on the origins of the mantua in the late 17th century, in ''Dress in Eighteenth Century Europe 1715–1789''; Ashelford, Jane, ''The Art of Dress''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hunting and riding dress ===

In a June 1666 diary entry, [[Samuel Pepys]] describes the Maids of Honour in their [[riding habit]]s of mannish coats, doublets, hats, and periwigs, "so that, only for a long petticoat dragging under their men's coats, nobody could take them for women in any point whatever". For riding [[Sidesaddle|side-saddle]], the costume had a long, trailing petticoat or skirt. This would be looped up or replaced by an ankle-length skirt for shooting or walking.

=== Hairstyles and headgear ===
Early in the period, hair was worn in a bun at the back of the head with a cluster of curls framing the face. The curls grew more elaborate through the 1650s, then longer, until curls were hanging gracefully on the shoulder. In the 1680s hair was parted in the center with height over the temples, and by the 1690s hair was unparted, with rows of curls stacked
high over the forehead.

This hairstyle was often topped with a ''[[fontange]]'', a frilly cap of lace wired to stand in vertical tiers with streamers to either side, named for [[Angélique de Fontanges|a mistress of the French King]]. This was popular from the 1690s to the first few years of the 18th century.

== Men's fashion ==

=== Overview ===

With the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the fashions of the 1650s and early 1660s imitated the new peaceful and more relaxed feeling in Europe. The military [[boot]]s gave way to shoes, and a mania for baggy breeches, short coats, and hundreds of yards of ribbon set the style. The breeches (see [[Petticoat breeches]]) became so baggy that [[Samuel Pepys]] wrote in his diary: "And among other things, met with Mr. Townsend, who told of his mistake the other day to put both his legs through one of his Knees of his breeches, and so went all day." (April 1661) The wide breeches that made such an error possible were soon being gathered at the knee: Pepys noted, 19 April 1663 "this day put on my close-kneed coloured suit, which, with new stockings of the colour, with belt, and new gilt-handled sword, is very handsome." This era was also one of great variation and transition.

In 1666, [[Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland]], following the earlier example of [[Louis XIV of France]], decreed that at court, men were to wear a long coat, a [[waistcoat|vest or waistcoat]] (originally called a ''petticoat'', a term which later became applied solely to women's dress), a [[necktie|cravat]], a [[wig (hair)|periwig or wig]], and [[breeches]] gathered at the knee, as well as a [[hat]] for outdoor wear. By 1680, this more sober uniform-like outfit of coat, waistcoat, and breeches became the norm for formal dress.

=== Coat and waistcoat ===
The unfitted looser fit of the [[1600–1650 in fashion|1640s]] continued into the 1650s. In the 1650s, [[sleeve]]s ranged from above to below the elbow. The sleeves could be slashed, unslashed, or dividing into two parts and buttoned together. The length of the coat reached the waist but by the late 1650s and early 1660s, the coat became very short, only reaching the bottom of the rib cage, much like a bolero jacket. During the 1660s, the sleeves varied a lot from elbow length to no sleeves at all. The coat could be worn opened or buttoned in the front. One common factor were many yards of ribbon loops arranged on the shoulders and the lower parts of the sleeves.

A longer and rather baggy coat (still with sleeves rarely going below the elbow) made an appearance in the early 1660s and as the decade progressed became the most popular coat. By the late 1660s, an upturned cuff became popular although the sleeves had still remained above the elbows. By the 1670s, a vest or waistcoat was worn under the coat. It was usually made of contrasting, often luxurious, fabric, and might have a plain back since that was not seen under the coat. It was a long garment which by the 1680s reached just above the knees. With the end of the 1670s the sleeves became longer and the coat more fitted. The 1680s saw larger upturned cuffs and the waist of the coat became much wider. The coat could have lapels or none. This coat is known as the ''[[justacorps]]''. The pockets on both sides of the coats were arranged horizontally or vertically (especially the mid to late 1680s) until the 1690s when the pockets were usually always arranged horizontally. The waistcoat could be sleeveless or have long sleeves. Typically, a long-sleeved waistcoat was worn in winter for added warmth. By the mid-1680s, ribbons were reduced to one side of the shoulder until by the 1690s, they were gone.

=== Shirt, collar and cravat ===
The ruffled long-sleeved white [[shirt]] remained the only constant throughout the period, although less of it was seen with the advent of the waistcoat.

During the early to mid-1650s, a rather small falling [[collar (clothing)|collar]] was in fashion. This increased in size and encompassed much of the shoulders by 1660. [[Cravat]]s and [[Jabot (neckwear)|jabots]] around the neck started to be worn during the early 1660s (initially with the falling collar). By the mid-1660s, the collar had disappeared with just the cravat remaining, sometimes tied with a small bow of ribbon. Red was the most common color for the bow, although pink, blue, and other colors were also used. By the 1670s, the bow of ribbons had increased in size and in the 1680s, the bow of ribbons became very large and intricate with many loops of ribbon. By the mid-1690s, the very large bow of ribbons was discarded. Also, a new style of cravat made its appearance in the 1690s, the ''Steinkerk'' (named after the [[Steenkerque|Battle of Steenkerque]] in 1692). Before, the cravat was always worn flowing down the chest; the Steinkerk cravat looped through a buttonhole of the coat.

=== Breeches and stockings ===
The previous decade saw [[Spanish breeches]] as the most popular. These were stiff breeches which fell above or just below the knee and were rather moderately fitted. By the mid-1650s, in Western Europe, much looser, uncollected breeches, called [[petticoat breeches]] became the most popular. As the 1650s progressed, they became larger and looser, very much giving the impression of a lady's [[petticoat]]. They were usually decorated with many yards of ribbon around the waist and around the ungathered knee on the outside of the leg. Alongside the petticoat breeches, a collected but still loose fitted breeches called [[rhinegraves]], were also worn. By the early 1660s, their popularity surpassed petticoat breeches. They were usually worn with an overskirt over them. The overskirt was heavily decorated with ribbon on the waist and the bottom of the skirt. Its length was usually just above the knee, but could also extend past the knee so that the rhinegraves underneath could not be seen and only the bottom of the stocking-tops was visible.

With the rising popularity of the longer coat and waistcoat, the large collected rhinegraves and overskirt were abandoned in favor of more close fitting breeches. By the late 1670s, close fitted breeches were worn with the stockings worn over them and on or above the knee, often being gartered with a garter below the knee. With the long waistcoat and stockings worn over the knee, very little of the breeches could be seen. A possible reason that the stockings were worn over the knee, was to give the impression of longer legs since the waist coat fell very low, just above the knee. The breeches tended to be of the same material as the coat. The stockings varied in color.

=== Footwear and accessories ===
Shoes again became the most popular footwear during the 1650s, although boots remained in use for riding and outdoor pursuits. ''[[Boothose]]'', originally of linen with lace cuffs and worn over the fine silk stockings to protect them from wear, remained in fashion even when boots lost their popularity. Boothose lasted well in the mid-1660s, attached right under where the rhinegraves were gathered below the knee, or fashionably slouched and unfastened. Shoes from the 1650s through the 1670s tended to be square toed and slightly long in appearance. Usually the shoes were tied with ribbon and decorated with bows. By the 1680s, the shoe became a bit more fitted; the heel increased in height (with red heels being very popular, especially for attendance at Court), and only a small ribbon if any remained.

The [[baldric]] (a sword hanger worn across one shoulder) was worn until the mid-1680s, when it was replaced by the sword belt (a sword hanger worn across the hips).

=== Hairstyles ===
[[File:Ex-voto a sainte-genevieve -Detail-Largilliere.jpg|right|thumb|The elaborate wig of the 1690s]]
Throughout the period, men wore their hair long with curls well past the shoulders. The bangs (fringe) were usually combed forward and allowed to flow over the forehead a bit. Although men had worn wigs for years to cover up thinning hair or baldness, the popularity of the wig or periwig as standard wardrobe is usually credited to King Louis XIV of France. Louis started to go bald at a relatively young age and had to cover up his baldness with wigs. His early wigs very much imitated what were the hairstyles of the day, but they gave a thicker and fuller appearance than natural hair. Due to the success of the wigs, other men started to wear wigs as well. By 1680, a part in the middle of the wig became the norm. The hair on either side of the part continued to grow in the 1680s until by the 1690s two very high pronounced points developed on the forehead. As well, during the 1680s, the wig was divided into three parts: the front including the center part and the long curls which fell well past the shoulders, the back of the head which was combed rather close to the head, and a mass of curls which flowed down the shoulders and back. The curls of the wig throughout the 1660s until 1700 were rather loose. Tighter curls would not make their appearance until after 1700. Every natural color of wig was possible. Louis XIV tended to favor a brown wig. His son, [[Louis, the Grand Dauphin|Monseigneur]] was well known for wearing blond wigs. Facial hair declined in popularity during this period although thin moustaches remained popular up until the 1680s.

=== Hats and headgear ===
[[Hat]]s vary greatly during this period. Hats with very tall crowns, derived from the earlier [[capotain]] but with flat crowns, were popular until the end of the 1650s. The brims varied as well. Hats were decorated with feathers. By the 1660s, a very small hat with a very low crown, little brim, and large amount of feathers was popular among the French courtiers. Later in the 1660s, very large brims and moderate crowns became popular. Sometimes one side of the brim would be turned up. These continued fashionable well into the 1680s. From the 1680s until 1700, various styles and combinations of upturned brims were in fashion, from one brim upturned to three brims upturned (the ''tricorne''). Even the angle at which the brims were situated on the head varied. Sometimes with a tricorne, the point would meet over the forehead or it would be set at a 45 degree angle from the forehead.

The '''arts of China''' (Chinese: 中國藝術/中国艺术) have varied throughout its [[History of China|ancient history]], divided into periods by the ruling [[dynasties of China]] and changing technology, but still containing a high degree of continuity.  Different forms of art have been influenced by great philosophers, teachers, religious figures and even political leaders. The arrival of [[Buddhism]] and modern Western influence produced especially large changes. Chinese art encompasses [[fine art]]s, [[folk art]]s and [[performance art]]s.

{{Main|History of Chinese art}}

Early forms of art in China were made from pottery and jade in the Neolithic period, to which was added bronze in the [[Shang Dynasty]]. The Shang are most remembered for their blue casting, noted for its clarity of detail. Early Chinese music and poetry was influenced by the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Songs]]'', [[Confucius]] and the Chinese poet and statesman [[Qu Yuan]].

In early imperial China, [[Chinese porcelain|porcelain]] was introduced and was refined to the point that in English the word ''china'' has become synonymous with high-quality porcelain. Around the 1st century AD, Buddhism arrived in China, though it did not become popular until the 4th century. At this point, Chinese Buddhist art began to flourish, a process which continued through the 20th century. It was during the period of Imperial China that [[calligraphy]] and painting became highly appreciated arts in court circles, with a great deal of work done on silk until well after the invention of paper.

Buddhist architecture and sculpture thrived in the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty]].  Of which, the Tang Dynasty was particularly open to foreign influence. Buddhist sculpture returned to a classical form, inspired by [[Indian art]] of the [[Gupta period]]. Towards the late Tang dynasty, all foreign religions were outlawed to support [[Taoism]].

==Literature==
{{main|Chinese literature}}

===Early Chinese poetry===

In addition to the ''Book of Songs'' ([[Shi Jing]]), a second early and influential poetic anthology was the [[Chu Ci|Songs of Chu]] ({{zh|s=楚辞|t=楚辭|p=Chǔ Cí}}), made up primarily of poems ascribed to the semilegendary [[Qu Yuan]] (c. 340–278 BC) and his follower [[Song Yu]] (fourth century BC). The songs in this collection are more lyrical and romantic and represent a different tradition from the earlier ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' (Shi Jing).  Many of the works in the text are associated with [[Shamanism]]. There are also descriptions of fantastic landscapes, examples of China's first nature poetry. The longest poem, "Encountering Sorrow," is reputed to have been written by the tragic {{Qu Yuan}} as a political allegory.

=== Han and Northern dynasties poetry ===
During, the Han Dynasty, Chu lyrics evolved into the ''[[fu (poetry)|fu]]'' (賦), a poem usually in rhymed verse except for introductory and concluding passages that are in prose, often in the form of questions and answers.  From the Han Dynasty onwards, a process similar to the origins of the [[Shi Jing]] produced the ''[[yuefu]]'' poems.

In the [[Northern Dynasties]] historical records indicate [[Cao Cao]] was a brilliant ruler and poet.  Cao Cao was also the father of the well-known poets [[Cao Pi]] and [[Cao Zhi]].  Cao Pi is known for writing the first [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poem]] using seven syllables per line (七言詩), the poem ''燕歌行''.

Cao Zhi demonstrated his spontaneous wit at an early age and was a front-running candidate for the throne; however, such ability was devoted to Chinese literature and poetry, which was encouraged by his father's subordinate officials. Later he surrounded himself with a group of poets and officials with literary interests, including some who continually showed off their smartness at the expense of Cao Cao and Cao Pi's subordinates and even Cao Cao himself.

[[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]]'s poetry influenced the work of many subsequent poets. Approximately 120 of his poems survive, which depict an idyllic [[pastoral]] life of farming and drinking.

=== Golden age of Chinese poetry ===
''[[Yuefu]]'' are [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poems]] composed in a [[folk song]] style.   The  term literally means "[[Music Bureau]]", a reference to the government organization originally charged with collecting or writing the [[lyrics]].

The lines are of uneven length, though five [[Chinese character|character]]s is the most common. Each poem follows one of a series of patterns defined by the song title. The term covers original folk songs, [[Noble court|court]] imitations and versions by known poets.

From the 2nd century AD, the ''yuefu'' began to develop into ''[[shi (poetry)|shi]]''—the form which was to dominate [[Chinese poetry]] until the modern era. The writers of these poems took the five-[[Chinese character|character]] line of the ''yuefu'' and used it to express more complex ideas. The ''shi'' poem was generally an expression of the poet's own persona rather than the adopted characters of the ''yuefu''; many were romantic nature poems heavily influenced by [[Taoism]].

The term ''[[Gushi (poetry)|gushi]]'' ("old poems") can refer either to the first, mostly anonymous ''shi'' poems, or more generally to the poems written in the same form by later poets. ''Gushi'' in this latter sense are defined essentially by what they are not; that is, they are not ''jintishi'' (regulated verse). The writer of ''gushi'' was under no formal constraints other than line length and [[rhyme]] (in every second line).

''Jintishi'', or [[regulated verse]], developed from the 5th century onwards.   By the Tang dynasty, a series of set [[Tonal language|tonal]] patterns had been developed, which were intended to ensure a balance between the four tones of classical [[Chinese spoken language|Chinese]] in each [[couplet]]: the level tone, and the three deflected tones (rising, falling and entering).  The Tang dynasty was the high point of the ''jintishi''.

Notable poets from this era include [[Bai Juyi]], [[Du Mu]], [[Han Yu]], [[Jia Dao]], [[Li Qiao]], [[Liu Zongyuan]], [[Luo Binwang]], [[Meng Haoran]], [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]], and [[Zhang Jiuling]].

===Li Bai and Du Fu===
[[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]] both lived during the Tang Dynasty.  They are regarded by many as the greatest of the Chinese poets.

[[File:Buddha Leshan01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], 71 meters tall, construction began in 713 AD, completed ninety years later.]]
Over a thousand poems are attributed to Li Bai, but the authenticity of many of these is uncertain. He is best known for his ''[[yuefu]]'' poems, which are intense and often [[fantastic]].  He is often associated with [[Taoism]]: there is a strong element of this in his works, both in the sentiments they express and in their spontaneous tone.  Nevertheless, his ''gufeng'' ("ancient airs") often adopt the perspective of the Confucian moralist, and many of his [[occasional verse]]s are fairly conventional.

Much like [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], many legends exist on how Li Bai effortlessly composed his poetry, even (or some say, especially) when drunk; his favorite form is the ''[[jueju]]'' (five- or seven-character quatrain), of which he composed some 160 pieces.  Using striking, unconventional imagery, Li Bai is able to create exquisite pieces to utilize fully the elements of the language.  His use of language is not as erudite as Du Fu's but equally effective, impressing through an extravagance of imagination and a direct connection of a free-spirited persona with the reader.  Li Bai's interactions with nature, friendship, and his acute observations of life inform his best poems.  Some of the rest, like ''Changgan xing'' (translated by [[Ezra Pound]] as ''A River Merchant's Wife: A Letter''), records the hardships or emotions of common people.  Like the best Chinese poets, Li Bai often evades translation.

Since the [[Song dynasty]], critics have called Du Fu the "poet historian".  The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on [[military tactic]]s or the successes and failures of the government, or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor.

One of the Du Fu's earliest surviving works, ''The Song of the Wagons'' (c. 750), gives voice to the sufferings of a [[conscription|conscript]] soldier in the imperial army, even before the beginning of the rebellion; this poem brings out the tension between the need of acceptance and fulfillment of one's [[duty|duties]], and a clear-sighted consciousness of the suffering which this can involve.

&lt;!-- Who is "Chou" in this graf? And which work is being cited? --&gt;
Du Fu's work is notable above all for its range. He mastered all the forms of [[Chinese poetry]]: Chou says that in every form he "either made outstanding advances or contributed outstanding examples" (p.&amp;nbsp;56). Furthermore, his poems use a wide range of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]s, from the direct and [[colloquial]] to the [[allusion|allusive]] and self-consciously literary. The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings ("[[chameleon]]like" according to Watson): his earliest works are in a relatively derivative, courtly style, but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion.  Owen comments on the "grim simplicity" of the Qinzhou poems, which mirrors the [[desert]] landscape (p.&amp;nbsp;425); the works from his Chengdu period are "light, often finely observed" (p.&amp;nbsp;427); while the poems from the late [[Kuizhou]] period have a "density and power of vision" (p.&amp;nbsp;433).

=== Late Tang and Five Dynasties poetry ===
[[Li Shangyin]] was a Chinese poet of the late Tang dynasty. He was a typical Late Tang poet: his works are sensuous, dense and allusive. The latter quality makes adequate translation extremely difficult. Many of his poems have political, romantic or philosophical implications, but it is often unclear which of these should be read into each work.

[[Li Houzhu|Li Yu]] was a Chinese poet and the last ruler of the Southern Tang Kingdom. His best-known poems were composed during the years after the Song formally ended his reign in 975 and brought him back as a captive to the Song capital, Bianjing (now [[Kaifeng]]). Li's works from this period dwell on his regret for the lost kingdom and the pleasures it had brought him. He was finally poisoned by the Song emperor in 978.

Li Yu developed the ''ci'' by broadening its scope from love to history and philosophy, particularly in his later works.  He also introduced the two-[[stanza]] form, and made great use of contrasts between longer lines of nine [[Chinese character|character]]s and shorter ones of three and five.

=== Song poetry ===
''[[ci (poetry)|Ci]]'' is a kind of [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] [[Chinese poetry]]. Beginning in the [[Liang Dynasty]], the ''ci'' followed the tradition of the [[Shi Jing]] and the ''[[yuefu]]'': they were lyrics which developed from anonymous popular songs (some of Central Asian origin) into a sophisticated literary genre.   The form was further developed in the [[Tang Dynasty]], and was most popular in the [[Song Dynasty]].  ''Ci'' most often expressed feelings of desire, often in an adopted [[persona]], but the greatest exponents of the form (such as [[Li Houzhu]] and [[Su Shi]]) used it to address a wide range of topics.  Well-known poets of the Song Dynasty include [[Zeng Gong]], [[Li Qingzhao]], [[Lu You]], [[Mei Yaochen]], [[Ouyang Xiu]], [[Su Dongpo]], [[Wang Anshi]], and [[Xin Qiji]].

===Ming literature===
The [[Ming Dynasty]] author [[Gao Qi]] is acknowledged as a great practitioner of [[Ming poetry|poetry during the Ming Dynasty]].  His poems are departure of those of earlier dynasties and formed a new style of poetry in the Ming dynasty.  [[Zhang Dai]] is acknowledged as the greatest essayist of the Ming dynasty. [[Wen Zhenheng]], the great grandson of [[Wen Zhengming]], wrote a classic on garden architecture and interior design, Zhang Wu Zhi (On Superfluous Things).

===Qing literature===
[[Yuan Mei]] was a well-known poet who lived during the [[Qing Dynasty]].  In the decades before his death, Yuan Mei produced a large body of poetry, essays and paintings. His works reflected his interest in [[Chan Buddhism]] and the supernatural, at the expense of [[Daoism]] and institutional Buddhism—both of which he rejected. Yuan is most famous for his poetry, which has been described as "unusually clear and elegant language". His views on poetry as expressed in the ''Suiyuan shihua'' (隨園詩話) stressed the importance of personal feeling and technical perfection.

Many great works of art and literature originated during the period, and the Qianlong emperor in particular undertook huge projects to preserve important cultural texts. The novel form became widely read and perhaps China's most famous novel, ''Dream of the Red Chamber'', was written in the mid-eighteenth century.

[[Cao Xueqin]] is the author of the famous Chinese work ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.  Extant handwritten copies of this work—some 80 chapters—had been in circulation in Beijing shortly after Cao's death, before [[Gao Ê]], who claimed to have access to the former's working papers, published a complete 120-chapter version in 1792.  [[Pu Songling]] was a famous writer of [[Liaozhai Zhiyi]] 《聊齋志異》during the [[Qing dynasty]].  He opened a [[tea house]] and invited his guests to tell stories, and then he would compile the tales into collections such as [[Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio]].

===Western influence: the Big Three===
In the early 20th century Shanghai became the birthplace and entertainment hub of the three new major art forms, [[Cinema of China|Chinese cinema]], [[Chinese animation]] and [[Chinese popular music]].  These entertainment were heavily inspired by western technology.  For the first time, local citizens adopted and molded western culture to fit into Chinese culture in a positive way without any imperial court intervention.

The most popular form of comics [[Lianhuanhua]] which circulated as palm sized books in Shanghai, [[Guangzhou]], [[Wuhan]] and [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]].  It became one of the most affordable form of entertainment art.  The famous [[Sanmao (comic book character)|Sanmao]] character would also be born at this time.

Chinese popular music musicians like [[Zhou Xuan]] and [[Li Jinhui]] were immediately endangered under the new regime as it labeled the genre [[Yellow Music|yellow music]] (pornography).  On the contrary, [[Guoyue|revolutionary music]] was promoted and brought to new heights like never before.  The [[Cinema of China|film]] and [[Chinese animation|animation]] industry would make their last run until the Cultural revolution, which would hinder any progress with serious restrictions and unreasonable censorship.  A large number of Shanghai citizens, including artists, immigrated to Hong Kong.  It would fuel the birth of modern Chinese art in the [[British colony]] that has until now, been largely dominated by British entertainment.  The pop music industry would rebound in [[Taiwan]] and Hong Kong.  The animation race would be lost to Japan.

=== Modern poetry ===
Modern Chinese poems (新詩 vers libre) usually do not follow any prescribed pattern.  [[Bei Dao]] is the most notable representative of the [[Misty Poets]], a group of Chinese poets who reacted against the restrictions of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The work of the Misty Poets and Bei Dao in particular were an inspiration to pro-democracy movements in China. Most notable was his poem ''"Huida"'' ("The Answer"), which was written during the [[Tiananmen Incident|1976 Tiananmen demonstrations]] in which he participated. The poem was taken up as a defiant anthem of the pro-democracy movement and appeared on posters during the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].&lt;ref name="Stanford Presidential Lecture text"&gt;{{cite web|last=Saussy|first=Haun|title=Bei Dao and his Audiences|url=http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/dao/daoaudience.html|work=Lecture|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Xu Zhimo]] is a [[Romanticism|romantic]] poet who loved the poetry of the English Romantics like [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]. He was one of the first Chinese writers to successfully naturalize Western romantic forms into modern Chinese poetry.

==Music==
[[File:Concert China.jpg|thumb|right|[[List of traditional Chinese musical instruments|Traditional]] style Chinese concert performance in China]]
{{main|Music of China}}

=== Early Chinese music ===
The origins of [[Chinese music]] and poetry can be found in the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Book of Songs]]'', containing poems composed between 1000 BC and 600 BC. The text, preserved among the canon of early [[Chinese literature]], contains folk songs, hymns and stately songs. Originally intended to be sung, the accompanying music unfortunately has since been lost. They had a wide range of purposes, including for courtship, ceremonial greetings, warfare, feasting and lamentation. The love poems are among the most appealing in the freshness and innocence of their language.

Early Chinese music was based on percussion instruments such as the bronze bell. Chinese bells were sounded by being struck from the outside, usually with a piece of wood. Sets of bells were suspended on wooden racks. Inside excavated bells are groves and marks of scraping and scratching made as they were tuned to the right pitch. Percussion instruments gradually gave way to string and reed instruments toward the Warring States period.

Significantly, the character for writing the word ''music'' (''yue'') was the same as that for ''joy'' (''le''). For [[Confucius]] and his disciples, music was important because it had the power to make people harmonious and well balanced, or, conversely, caused them to be quarrelsome and depraved. According to [[Xun Zi]], music was as important as the ''li'' ("rites"; "etiquette") stressed in [[Confucianism]]. [[Mozi]], philosophically opposed to Confucianism, disagreed. He dismissed music as having only aesthetic uses, and thus useless and wasteful.

==Performing art==

=== Yuan drama ===
[[Chinese opera]] is a popular form of drama in China. In general, it dates back to the [[Tang dynasty]] with Emperor [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang China|Xuanzong]] (712–755), who founded the "[[Pear Garden]]" (梨园), the first known opera troupe in China. The troupe mostly performed for the emperors' personal pleasure. To this day operatic professionals are still referred to as "Disciples of the Pear Garden" (梨园子弟). In the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279–1368), forms like the ''[[Zaju]]'' ([[:zh:杂剧|杂剧]], variety plays), which acts based on rhyming schemes plus the innovation of having specialized roles like "[[Dan (Chinese opera)|Dan]]" (旦, female), "[[Sheng of Chinese opera|Sheng]]" (生, male) and "[[Chou (Chinese Opera)|Chou]]" (丑, Clown), were introduced into the opera. 
[[File:HongKong003.jpg|thumb|Modern performers of [[Cantonese opera]] in Hong Kong]]
[[Cantonese opera]], which originated from the north and developed over time since, contains many well-known programs such as ''The Purple Hairpin'' and ''Rejuvenation of the Red Plum Flower'', originated from the [[Yuan Dynasty]].

=== Peking opera ===
[[File:Beijing opera02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beijing opera]] scene.]]
The best-known form of [[Chinese opera]] is Beijing or [[Peking opera]], which assumed its present form in the mid-19th century and was extremely popular in the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911).  In Beijing Opera, traditional Chinese string and percussion instruments provide a strong rhythmic accompaniment to the acting. The acting is based on allusion: gestures, footwork, and other body movements express such actions as riding a horse, rowing a boat, or opening a door.

Although it is called Beijing opera, its origins are not in Beijing but in the Chinese provinces of [[Anhui]] and [[Hubei]]. Beijing opera got its two main [[Four Great Characteristic Melodies|melodies]], ''[[Xipi]]'' and ''[[Erhuang]]'', from Anhui and Hubei operas. Much dialogue is also carried out in an archaic dialect originating partially from those regions. It also absorbed music and arias from other operas and musical arts such as the historic [[Qinqiang]]. It is regarded that Beijing Opera was born when the [[Four Great Anhui Troupes]] came to Beijing in 1790. Beijing opera was originally staged for the court and came into the public later. In 1828, some famous Hubei troupes came to Beijing. They often jointly performed in the stage with Anhui troupes. The combination gradually formed Beijing opera's main melodies.
[[File:Chinese women in pink, dancing (2007-07-05).jpg|thumb|Chinese dance]]

===Dance===
{{main|Dance of China}}
In ancient China. Chinese dance was divided into two types, civilian and military.  In the Shang and Zhou period, civilian dance, dancers held feather banners in their hands, symbolizing the distribution of the fruits of the day's hunting or fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.houstoncul.org/eng_culexg/c004.htm |title=The Art of Chinese Dance |work=Cultural Division, Taipei Economic &amp; Cultural Office in Houston }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Military dance involved brandishing of weapons, for example it was recorded that the Han founding Emperor [[Liu Bang]] was fond of the war dance of the [[Ba (state)|Ba people]], and large scale performances of the dance involved the brandishing of various weapons to the accompaniment of drums and songs in the Ba language.&lt;ref name="ta cheng"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ta Chʻeng, Great Perfection - Religion and Ethnicity in a Chinese Millennial Kingdom |author=Terry F. Kleeman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FAJrw0yInnAC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year=1998 |pages=45–46 |isbn=0-8248-1800-8  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known Chinese dances are the [[Dragon dance]] and the [[Lion Dance]].

===Contemporary art===
New forms of Chinese art were heavily influenced by the [[New Culture Movement]], which adopted Western techniques and employed [[socialist realism]]. The [[Cultural Revolution]] would shape Chinese art in the 20th century like no other event in history with the [[Four Olds]] destruction campaign. Contemporary Chinese artists continue to produce a wide range of experimental works, multimedia installations, and performance "happenings" which have become very popular in the international art market.

=== Han Paper art ===
The most notable invention of the Han period was paper which spawned two new types of arts. [[Chinese Paper Cutting]] became a new concept. The idea of expressing symbols and Chinese characters already a part of calligraphy was now extended to Han paper cut outs. Another art form was the [[Chinese paper folding]]. While it has its roots in the Han dynasty, later renditions would transform the art into [[origami]], after Buddhist monks took paper to Japan.&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;Lang, Robert James.

It was founded in 1932. It was originally called the Beloit Little Theatre Guild.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.madstage.com/Companies/beloitcivic.html MadStage.com – Beloit Civic Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the first season, two plays were performed and the theater had a membership of 250.
By the next year, membership had grown to 1300, making it the largest community theater in Wisconsin. In 1948 the theater's name was changed to The Beloit Civic Theatre. Revenue from this theater goes toward a [[scholarship]] fund for graduating high school seniors who plan to study the [[performing arts]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Beloit Civic Theatre {{!}} Travel Wisconsin|url = http://www.travelwisconsin.com/venue/beloit-civic-theatre-200111|website = TravelWisconsin|accessdate = 2015-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''butterfly dance''' is a dance move in which the dancer's legs move like butterfly wings. The move originated from the music genre [[hip-hop]] and is also commonly seen in [[reggae]] type music.&lt;ref&gt;Safi Thomas, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlpnDa2J9kM How to Dance to Reggae Dancehall: How to Do the Butterfly in Reggae Dancehall] at YouTube.com. Hip-hop Dance Conservatory, New York City, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The dance is a female move but male individuals have been seen to execute the move.

This dance move originated in the 1970s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">[[Image:TwoCells.png|thumb|A trivial example of a Corner-point grid with only two cells.]]
In [[geometry]], a '''corner-point grid''' is a [[tessellation]] of a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] 3D volume where the base cell has 6 [[Face (geometry)|faces]] ([[hexahedron]]).

A set of straight lines defined by their end points define the ''pillars'' of the corner-point grid. The pillars have a lexicographical ordering that determines neighbouring pillars. On each pillar, a constant number of nodes (corner-points) is defined. A corner-point cell is now the volume between 4 neighbouring pillars and two neighbouring points on each pillar. 

Each cell can be identified by integer coordinates &lt;math&gt;(i,j,k)&lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; coordinate runs along the pillars, and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; span each layer. The cells are ordered naturally, where the index &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; runs the fastest and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; the slowest.

Data within the interior of such cells can be computed by [[trilinear interpolation]] from the boundary values at the 8 corners, 12 edges, and 6 faces.

In the special case of all pillars being vertical, the top and bottom face of each corner-point cell are described by [[Bilinear interpolation|bilinear surfaces]] and the side faces are [[plane (geometry)|plane]]s.

Corner-point grids are supported by most [[reservoir simulation]] software, and has become an industry standard.

==Degeneracy==

A main feature of the format is the ability to define [[erosion surface]]s in [[geological modelling]], effectively done by collapsing nodes along each pillar. This means that the corner-point cells degenerate and may have less than 6 faces.

For the corner-point grids non-neighboring connections are supported, meaning that grid cells that are not neighboring in ijk-space can be defined as neighboring. This feature allows for representation of faults with significant throw/displacement. Moreover, the neighboring grid cells do not need to have matching cell faces (just overlap).

'''David Wight Prall''' (1886–1940) was a [[aesthetics|philosopher of art]]. Born on 5 October 1886 in Saginaw, Michigan, Prall received his PhD in philosophy from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1918.

Prall was Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University (1920–21; 1930–40). He taught also at Cornell (1910–12), the University of Texas (1912–14), Amherst (1918–19), and the [[University of California]] (1921–30). While at Harvard, Prall was a teacher and mentor to the notable composer and conductor, [[Leonard Bernstein]].

Prall died on 21 October 1940 in Cambridge. MA. His papers are held at Mills College, Oakland, California.

'''Direct-to-fan''' is a [[business model]] used by independent musicians, [[independent record label|independent music labels]], music marketing professionals, promoters, and others in the music industry.  Direct-to-fan is also becoming a model used by the broad definition of artists, including comedians, visual artists, and other entertainers looking to build and [[Leverage (negotiation)|leverage]] a fan community throughout their career.

The direct-to-fan model bypasses the [[major record label]] model that historically controlled radio, [[Music venue|venue]], and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] channels, and lets the artist (or the team that supports that musician) create interest in their music directly with their [[Fan (person)|fans]], identify those fans, market directly to and develop relationships with those fans, sell directly to and [[monetize]] those relationships, and use those relationships to expand their fan base.

Foundation components of this model include music [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] sites, and direct-to-fan music sales, marketing, and business solutions.

Direct-to-fan models encourage engaging directly between the artist and their fans, keeping the fans engaged, knowing who they are (who, what, when, where, why), building the artist's brand, and developing the artist-to-fan relationship over time.

==Background==
An early example of this method in the music industry was by the British rock band [[Marillion]], who used the internet to connect with their fans to finance a North American tour in 1997 and a subsequent album in 2001, instead of signing to a record label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1325340.stm | title= Marillion fans to the rescue | first=Tim |last=Masters | work=BBC News | date=11 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Alexis Petridis]] described the band in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "the undisputed pioneers" of this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/18/popandrock.alexispetridis | title= This song was brought to you by ... | work=The Guardian | first=Alexis | last=Petridis | date=18 April 2008 | accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also addressed by [[Michael Lewis]] in his book ''[[Next: The Future Just Happened]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/21/computingandthenet.highereducation | title= The kids are all wired | work=The Guardian | first=Steven | last=Poole | date=21 July 2001 | accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
Some tools supporting direct-to-fan include: storefronts to sell direct-to-fan on band websites and on [[social networking]] sites such as Facebook or MySpace, [[GUI widget|Widget]] tools to embed sales, gig or event calendar, [[User profile|profile]] info anywhere including [[blogs]], Marketing tools such as [[email marketing]] and [[messaging]], [[Event planning|Event]] tools, Central [[Content Management]] tools, Central Catalog Management tools for both digital and physical products, and digital delivery platforms that make it easy for you to sell direct from your website or social media by integrating with payment gateways, providing a checkout and automatically delivering music to fans via a download link.

==Sales, marketing, and business solutions==
More complete, one-place-to-manage-everything direct-to-fan solutions are beginning to emerge.  They help the artist's team with fan management, [[brand management]], sales, marketing, distribution, manufacturing, [[event management]], [[merchandizing]], warehousing, fulfillment, and more, all from one [[dashboard]].

==Solution example==
An example of a direct-to-fan solution would have online storefronts for their official band websites, Facebook, MySpace, [[blogs]], etc.; Marketing solutions for [[email marketing]], [[Fan (person)|fan]] capture, fan [[messaging]], and fan management; Label services including [[digital distribution]] to [[iTunes]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and other retail sites, CD and DVD manufacturing, custom [[merch]], print services, [[graphic design]] and web services, [[warehousing]] and fulfilment, backend [[ecommerce]] and payment processing, and more.

Core applications that assist musicians in implementing a direct-to-fan approach include:

* Fan community platforms
*Band website and storefronts
* digital delivery companies
* CD/DVD manufacturing
* [[Digital music]] distribution
* Download cards
* E-tickets and mobile-tickets
* Fan email marketing and messaging
* Fan marketing solutions

* Music festival submissions
* Payment processing
* Physical warehousing and fulfillment
* [[Poster]] and print services
* Storefronts

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3601">In the [[Weimar Republic]], and later in [[Nazi Germany]], the '''Film Review Office''' (German: ''Filmprüfstelle'') was responsible for [[censorship]] of the [[film industry]] within Germany. The Office had two locations: one in [[Berlin]] and one in [[Munich]].

==Legal basis==

Article 118 of the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[constitution]] forbade censorship outright, with the text "No censorship will take place." On May 12, 1920, however, the Weimar government passed the "Lichtspielgesetz" (''Cinema Act''). This law established an ordinance to regulate the exhibition of visual media. The two largest film producers were based out of Berlin and Munich, respectively. As such, the Film Review Office was based out of these two cities.

The Munich Office was given jurisdiction over the states of [[Bavaria]], [[Württemberg]], [[Baden]], and [[Hessia]]. The Berlin Office was given jurisdiction over the rest of Germany. In addition, a supervisory headquarters (German: ''Oberprüfstelle'') was established in Berlin.

==Weimar years==

From 1920 to 1924, the supervisory headquarters was chaired by Dr. [[Carl Bulcke]]; in 1924 he was replaced by [[Ernst Seeger]] (who later served as Minister of Film in the [[Propagandaministerium]] under [[Joseph Goebbels]]). Each office had a chair appointed by the [[Minister of the Interior]]. That chair chose a panel out of leading figures from film, literature, the arts, education, and social welfare.

The Film Review Office reviewed films along with their titles and [[advertising]] material. This included films which were released before the Cinema Act was passed if they were re-released in [[theater]]s. Foreign films due for release in Germany also needed to be submitted to the Film Review Office. Review was mandatory; refusal to submit a film carried a monetary fine. The process, however, was not [[public]]: reviews were held privately and results were returned directly to the film firms.

Censorship by the Film Review Office served as a [[security]] consideration. The only grounds on which a film could be censored were in perceived cases of danger to the interests of the [[State (polity)|state]] or in threats to public [[Social order|order]] and security. Films determined unobjectionable were then submitted to the Parliament (German: ''[[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]]'') for review of artistic aspects by the Central Institute for Education and Instruction.

==Nazi years==

The Second Cinema Act was passed on 16 February 1934. This entailed several changes to the Film Review Office, centralizing the censorship of film. The office in Munich was closed; thereafter all film was censored by the Berlin office. The [[Propagandaministerium]] took over the job of overseeing the office.

With the new system came new principles; the line between censorship for security and aesthetic censorship disappeared and the Film Review Office began censoring on artistic grounds. The [[Führerprinzip]] became the guiding principle of the headquarters. The council was reduced to a purely advisory function and the chair, under supervision of the Propagandaminister, had the final word on all films.

[[File:Frigg by Doepler.jpg|thumb|Frigg sits enthroned and facing the spear-wielding goddess [[Gná]], flanked by two goddesses, one of whom ([[Fulla]]) carries her ''eski'', a wooden box. Illustrated (1882) by [[Carl Emil Doepler]].]]
In [[Germanic mythology]], '''Frigg''' ({{IPAc-en|f|r|ɪ|g}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/frigg "Frigg"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Norse]]), '''Frija''' ([[Old High German]]), '''Frea''' ([[Langobardic language|Langobardic]]), and '''Frige''' ([[Old English]]) is a goddess. In nearly all sources, she is described as the wife of the god [[Odin]]. In Old High German and [[Old Norse]] sources, she is also connected with the goddess [[Fulla]]. The English weekday name [[Friday]] ([[etymology|etymologically]] Old English "Frīge's day") bears her name.

Frigg is described as a goddess associated with foresight and wisdom in [[Norse mythology]], the northernmost branch of Germanic mythology and most extensively attested. Frigg is the wife of the major god [[Odin]] and dwells in the wetland halls of [[Fensalir]], is famous for her [[Precognition|foreknowledge]], is associated with the goddesses Fulla, [[Lofn]], [[Hlín]], and [[Gná and Hófvarpnir|Gná]], and is ambiguously associated with the Earth, otherwise personified as an apparently separate entity [[Jörð]] (Old Norse "Earth"). The children of Frigg and Odin include the gleaming god [[Baldr]]. Due to the significant thematic overlap, scholars have proposed a particular connection to the goddess [[Freyja]].

After [[Christianization]], the mention of Frigg continued to occur in [[Scandinavian folklore]]. In modern times, Frigg has appeared in modern popular culture, has been the subject of art and receives modern veneration in [[Germanic Neopaganism]].

==Etymology, ''Friday'', and toponymy==
The [[theonym]]s ''Frigg'' (Old Norse) and ''Frija'' (Old High German) are [[cognate]] forms—linguistic siblings of the same origin—that descend from a substantivized feminine of [[Proto-Germanic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''frijaz'' (via [[Holtzmann's law]]). *''frijaz'' descends from the same source ([[Proto-Indo-European]]) as the feminine [[Sanskrit]] noun ''priyā'' and the feminine [[Avestan]] noun ''fryā'' (both meaning "own, dear, beloved").{{sfnp|Orel|2003|p=114}} In the modern period, an [[Latin declension#First declension (a)|-a suffix]] is sometimes applied to denote femininity, resulting in the form ''Frigga''.&lt;ref name=ASUFFIX&gt;See for example {{harvp|Bulfinch|1913|p=344}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This spelling also serves the purpose of distancing the goddess from the English word ''[[Frig (interjection)|frig]]''.{{sfn|Sheard|2011|p=238}}

The connection with and possible earlier identification of the goddess [[Freyja]] with Frigg in the [[Common Germanic deities|Proto-Germanic]] period ([[Frigg and Freyja origin hypothesis]]) is a matter of scholarly debate.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56–66}} The name ''Freyja'' is not attested outside of [[Scandinavia]], like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the [[Vanir]]. This is in contrast to the name of the goddess ''Frigg'', who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as [[Proto-Germanic]] *''[[Frijjō]]''. Evidence does not exist for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which Old Norse ''Freyja'' descends, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of surviving sources.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56–66}}

Regarding a Freyja–Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar [[Stephan Grundy]] comments that "the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-[[Viking Age]] references to [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Germanic goddesses]], and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported."{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|p=57}}

The English [[weekday]] name ''[[Friday]]'' comes from Old English ''Frīġedæġ'', meaning 'day of Frige'. It is cognate with [[Old High German]] ''frîatac''.{{sfnp|Simek|2007|pp=93–94}} Several [[toponymy|place names]] refer to Frigg in what are now Norway and Sweden, although her name is altogether absent in recorded place names in Denmark.{{sfnp|Pulsiano|Wolf|1993|p=503}}

===''Origi Gentis Langobardorum'' and ''Historia Langobardorum''===
[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Godan and Frea look down from their window in the heavens to the Winnili women in an illustration by [[Emil Doepler]], 1905]]
[[Image:Wodan Frea Himmelsfenster II by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|Winnili women with their hair tied as beards look up at Godan and Frea in an illustration by Emil Doepler, 1905]]
The 7th-century ''[[Origo Gentis Langobardorum]]'', and [[Paul the Deacon]]'s 8th-century ''[[Historia Langobardorum]]'' derived from it, recount a founding myth of the [[Langobards]], a Germanic people who ruled a region of what is now Italy (see [[Lombardy]]). According to this legend, a "small people" known as the ''[[Winnili]]'' were ruled by a woman named [[Gambara]] who had two sons, [[Ybor and Agio]]. The [[Vandals]], ruled by [[Ambri and Assi]], came to the Winnili with their army and demanded that they pay them tribute or prepare for war. Ybor, Agio, and their mother Gambara rejected their demands for tribute. Ambra and Assi then asked the god Godan for victory over the Winnili, to which Godan responded (in the longer version in the ''Origo''): "Whom I shall first see when at sunrise, to them will I give the victory."{{sfnp|Foulke|2003|pp=315–16}}

Meanwhile, Ybor and Agio called upon Frea, Godan's wife. Frea counseled them that "at sunrise the Winnil[i] should come, and that their women, with their hair let down around the face in the likeness of a beard should also come with their husbands". At sunrise, Frea turned Godan's bed around to face east and woke him. Godan saw the Winnili, including their whiskered women, and asked "who are those Long-beards?" Frea responded to Godan, "As you have given them a name, give them also the victory". Godan did so, "so that they should defend themselves according to his counsel and obtain the victory". Thenceforth the Winnili were known as the ''Langobards'' ([[Lombardic language|Langobardic]] "long-beards").{{sfnp|Foulke|2003|pp=316–17}}

===Second Merseburg Incantation===
[[File:Wodan Heilt Balders Pferd by Emil Doepler.jpg|thumb|"Wodan Heals Balder's Horse" by Emil Doepler, 1905]]
A 10th-century manuscript found in what is now [[Merseburg]], Germany, features an invocation known as the [[Merseburg Incantations|Second Merseburg Incantation]]. The incantation calls upon various continental Germanic gods, including Old High German Frija and a goddess associated with her—[[Fulla|Volla]], to assist in healing a horse:

===''Poetic Edda''===
In the ''Poetic Edda'', compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, Frigg is mentioned in the poems ''[[Völuspá]]'', ''[[Vafþrúðnismál]]'', the prose of ''[[Grímnismál]]'', ''[[Lokasenna]]'', and ''[[Oddrúnargrátr]]''.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=305}}

Frigg receives three mentions in the ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''Völuspá''. In the first mention, the poem recounts that Frigg wept for the death of her son [[Baldr]] in [[Fensalir]].{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=8}} Later in the poem, when the future death of Odin is foretold, Odin himself is referred to as the "beloved of Frigg" and his future death is referred to as the "second grief of Frigg".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=11}} Like  the reference to Frigg weeping in Fensalir earlier in the poem, the implied "first grief" is a reference to the grief she felt upon the death of her son, [[Baldr]].&lt;ref name="LARRINGTON-266"&gt;See, for example, {{harvp|Larrington|1999|p=266}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frigg and Odin in Grímnismál by Frølich.jpg|thumb|The goddess Frigg and her husband, the god Odin, sit in Hliðskjálf and gaze into "all worlds" and make a wager as described in ''Grímnismál'' in an illustration by [[Lorenz Frølich]], 1895]]
In the prose introduction to the poem ''[[Grímnismál]]'', Frigg plays a prominent role. The prose introduction recounts that two sons of king [[Hrauðungr]], Agnar (age 10) and Geirröðr (age 8), once sailed out with a trailing line to catch small fish. However, wind drove them out into the ocean and, during the darkness of night, their boat wrecked. The brothers went ashore and there they met a [[Croft (land)|crofter]]. They stayed on the croft for one winter. During that winter, the couple separately fostered the two children: the old woman fostered Agnar and the old man fostered Geirröðr. Upon the arrival of spring, the old man brought them a ship. The old couple took the boys to the shore, and the old man took Geirröðr aside and spoke to him. The boys entered the boat and a breeze came.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}}

The boat returned to the harbor of their father. Geirröðr, forward in the ship, jumped to shore and pushed the boat, containing his brother, out and said "go where an evil spirit may get thee."{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=18}} Away went the ship and Geirröðr walked to a house, where he was greeted with joy; while the boys were gone, their father had died, and now Geirröðr was king. He "became a splendid man".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}} The scene switches to Odin and Frigg sitting in [[Hliðskjálf]], "look[ing] into [[Norse cosmology|all the worlds]]".{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=51}} Odin says: "'Seest thou Agnar, thy foster-son, where he is getting children a giantess [Old Norse ''[[gȳgi]]''] in a cave? while Geirröd, my foster son, is a king residing in his country.' Frigg answered, 'He is so inhospitable that he tortures his guests, if he thinks that too many come.'"{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=19}}

Odin replied that this was a great untruth and so the two made a wager. Frigg sent her "waiting-maid" [[Fulla]] to warn Geirröðr to be wary, lest a wizard who seeks him should harm him, and that he would know this wizard by the refusal of dogs, no matter how ferocious, to attack the stranger. While it was not true that Geirröðr was inhospitable with his guests, Geirröðr did as instructed and had the wizard arrested. Upon being questioned, the wizard, wearing a blue cloak, said no more than that his name is ''[[List of names of Odin|Grímnir]]''. Geirröðr has Grímnir tortured and sits him between two fires for 8 nights. Upon the 9th night, Grímnir is brought a full [[drinking horn]] by Geirröðr's son, Agnar (so named after Geirröðr's brother), and the poem continues without further mention or involvement of Frigg.{{sfnp|Thorpe|1907|p=19}}

In the poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', where [[Loki]] accuses nearly every female in attendance of promiscuity and/or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between the god Loki and the goddess Frigg (and thereafter between Loki and the goddess Freyja about Frigg). A prose introduction to the poem describes that numerous gods and goddesses attended a banquet held by [[Ægir]]. These gods and goddesses include Odin and, "his wife", Frigg.{{sfnp|Larrington|1999|p=84}}

===''Prose Edda''===
Frigg is mentioned throughout the ''Poetic Edda'', compiled in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. Frigg is first mentioned in the ''Prose Edda'' [[Prologue (Prose Edda)]], wherein a [[Euhemerus|euhemerized]] account of the Norse gods is provided. The author describes Frigg as the wife of Odin, and, in a case of [[folk etymology]], the author attempts to associate the name ''Frigg'' with the Latin-influenced form ''Frigida''.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=3}} The Prologue adds that both Frigg and Odin "had the gift of prophecy".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=3}}

In the next section of the ''Prose Edda'', ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', [[High, Just-as-High, and Third|High]] tells [[Gylfi|Gangleri]] (the king [[Gylfi]] in disguise) that Frigg, daughter of [[Fjörgynn]] (Old Norse ''Fjörgynsdóttir'') is married to Odin and that the [[Æsir]] are descended from the couple, and adds that "the earth [''[[Jörð]]in''] was [Odin's] daughter and his wife".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=13}} According to High, the two had many sons, the first of which was the mighty god [[Thor]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=13}}

[[File:Frigg and Fulla 1874.jpg|thumb|Frigg reaches into a box presented to her by a handmaid, [[Ludwig Pietsch]], 1865]]
Later in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', Gangleri asks about the ''[[ásynjur]]'', a term for Norse goddesses. High says that "highest" among them is Frigg and that only [[Freyja]] "is highest in rank next to her". Frigg dwells in [[Fensalir]] "and it is very splendid".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=29}} In this section of ''Gylfaginning'', Frigg is also mentioned in connection to other ''ásynjur'': [[Fulla]] carries Frigg's ashen box, "looks after her footwear and shares her secrets"; [[Lofn]] is given special permission by Frigg and Odin to "arrange unions" among men and women; [[Hlín]] is charged by Frigg to protect those that Frigg deems worthy of keeping from danger; and [[Gná and Hófvarpnir|Gná]] is sent by Frigg "into various worlds to carry out her business".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=29–30}}

In section 49 of ''Gylfaginning'', a narrative about the fate of Frigg's son Baldr is told. According to High, Baldr once started to have dreams indicating that his life was in danger. When Baldr told his fellow Æsir about his dreams, the gods met together for a [[thing (assembly)|thing]] and decided that they should "request immunity for Baldr from all kinds of danger". Frigg subsequently receives promises from the elements, the environment, diseases, animals, and stones, amongst other things. The request successful, the Æsir make sport of Baldr's newfound invincibility; shot or struck, Baldr remained unharmed. However, [[Loki]] discovers this and is not pleased by this turn of events, so, in the form of a woman, he goes to Frigg in Fensalir.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}}

There, Frigg asks this female visitor what the Æsir are up to assembled at the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]]. The woman says that all of the Æsir are shooting at Baldr and yet he remains unharmed. Frigg explains that "Weapons and wood will not hurt Baldr. I have received oaths from them all."{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}} The woman asks Frigg if all things have sworn not to hurt Baldr, to which Frigg notes one exception; "there grows a shoot of a tree to the west of [[Valhalla|Val-hall]]. It is called [[mistletoe]]. It seemed young to me to demand the oath from."{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}} Loki immediately disappears.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=48}}

[[File:Baldr's Death by Frølich.jpg|thumb|Frigg grips her dead son, Baldr, in an illustration by Lorenz Frølich, 1895]]
Now armed with mistletoe, Loki arrives at the thing where the Æsir are assembled and tricks the blind [[Höðr]], Baldr's brother, into shooting Baldr with a mistletoe projectile. To the horror of the assembled gods, the mistletoe goes directly through Baldr, killing him. Standing in horror and shock, the gods are initially only able to weep due to their grief. Frigg speaks up and asks "who there was among the Æsir who wished to earn all her love and favour and was willing to ride the road to [[Hel (location)|Hel]] and try if he could find Baldr, and offer [[Hel (being)|Hel]] a ransom if she would let Baldr go back to Asgard".{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=49}}

[[Hermóðr]], Baldr's brother, accepts Freyja's request and rides to Hel. Meanwhile, Baldr is given a grand funeral attended by many beings&amp;mdash;foremost mentioned of which are his mother and father, Frigg and Odin. During the funeral, [[Nanna (Norse deity)|Nanna]] dies of grief and is placed in the funeral pyre with Baldr, her dead husband.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=49–50}} Hermóðr locates Baldr and Nanna in Hel. Hermodr secures an agreement for the return of Baldr and with Hermóðr Nanna sends gifts to Frigg (a linen robe) and Fulla (a finger-ring). Hermóðr rides back to the Æsir and tells them what has happened. However, the agreement fails due to the sabotage of a jötunn in a cave named [[Þökk]] (Old Norse 'thanks'), described perhaps Loki in disguise.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=50–51}}

Frigg is mentioned several times in the ''Prose Edda'' section ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]''. The first mention occurs at the beginning of the section, where the [[Æsir]] and Ásynjur are said to have once held a banquet in a hall in a land of gods, [[Asgard]]. Frigg is one of the twelve ásynjur in attendance.{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|p=59}}

===''Heimskringla'' and sagas===
In ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'', the first book of ''[[Heimskringla]]'', an [[Euhemerized]] account of the origin of the gods is provided. Frigg is mentioned once. According to the saga, while Odin was away, Odin's brothers [[Vili and Vé]] oversaw Odin's holdings. Once, while Odin was gone for an extended period, the Æsir concluded that he was not coming back. His brothers started to divvy up Odin's inheritance, "but his wife Frigg they shared between them. However, a short while afterwards, [Odin] returned and took possession of his wife again.{{sfnp|Hollander|2007|p=7}}

In ''[[Völsunga saga]]'', the great king [[Rerir]] and his wife (unnamed) are unable to conceive a child; "that lack displeased them both, and they fervently implored the gods that they might have a child. It is said that Frigg heard their prayers and told Odin what they asked".{{sfnp|Byock|1990|p=36}}

==Archaeological record==
A 12th century depiction of a cloaked but otherwise nude woman riding a large cat appears on a wall in the [[Schleswig Cathedral]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Northern Germany]]. Beside her is similarly a cloaked yet otherwise nude woman riding a [[distaff]]. Due to iconographic similarities to the literary record, these figures have been theorized as depictions of Freyja and Frigg respectively.{{sfnp|Jones|Pennick|1995|pp=144–45}}

==Scholarly reception and interpretation==
{{main|Frigg and Freyja common origin hypothesis}}
Due to numerous similarities, some scholars have proposed that the Old Norse goddesses Frigg and [[Freyja]] descend from a common entity from the [[Proto-Germanic]] period.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56{{ndash}}66}} Regarding a Freyja-Frigg common origin hypothesis, scholar [[Stephan Grundy]] comments that "the problem of whether Frigg or Freyja may have been a single goddess originally is a difficult one, made more so by the scantiness of pre-[[Viking Age]] references to [[List of Germanic deities and heroes|Germanic goddesses]], and the diverse quality of the sources. The best that can be done is to survey the arguments for and against their identity, and to see how well each can be supported."{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|p=57}}

Unlike Frigg but like the name of the group of gods to which Freyja belongs, the [[Vanir]], the name ''Freyja'' is not attested outside of [[Scandinavia]], as opposed to the name of the goddess ''Frigg'', who is attested as a goddess common among the Germanic peoples, and whose name is reconstructed as [[Proto-Germanic]] [[Asterisk#Historical linguistics|*]]''[[Frijjō]]''. Similar proof for the existence of a common Germanic goddess from which ''Freyja'' descends does not exist, but scholars have commented that this may simply be due to the scarcity of evidence outside of the North Germanic record.{{sfnp|Grundy|1998|pp=56{{ndash}}66}}

==Modern influence==
Frigg is referenced in art and literature into the modern period. In the 18th century, [[Gustav III of Sweden]], king of Sweden, composed ''Friggja'', a play, so named after the goddess, and H. F. Block and [[Hans Friedrich Blunck]]'s ''Frau Frigg und Doktor Faust'' in 1937. Other examples include fine art works by K. Ehrenberg (''Frigg, Freyja'', drawing, 1883), [[John Charles Dollman]] (''Frigga Spinning the Clouds'', painting, c. 1900),  [[Emil Doepler]] (''Wodan und Frea am Himmelsfenster'', painting, 1901), and H. Thoma (''Fricka'', drawing, date not provided).{{sfnp|Simek|2007|p=94}}

[[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] appears in [[Marvel Comics]] and in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as the queen of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], wife of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], mother of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and the adoptive mother of [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. 

The Finnish folk band [[Frigg (band)|Frigg]] takes its name from the deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2012/09/finlands-frigg-uk-debut-tour/|title=Finland's 'Frigg' – UK Debut Tour – Folk Radio UK|date=27 September 2012|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frigg.fi |title=Hot Fiddles from Cool Scandinavia |date= |accessdate=20 September 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412082933/http://www.frigg.fi/ |archivedate=12 April 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Girih tiles''' are a set of five [[tile]]s that were used in the creation of [[Islamic geometric patterns]] using [[strapwork]] ([[girih]]) for decoration of buildings in [[Islamic architecture]]. They have been used since about the year 1200 and their arrangements found significant improvement starting with the [[Darb-i Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]] in [[Iran]] built in 1453.

==Five tiles==

The five shapes of the tiles are:
* a regular [[decagon]] with ten interior angles of 144°;
* an elongated (irregular convex) [[hexagon]] with interior angles of 72°, 144°, 144°, 72°, 144°, 144°;
* a [[bow tie]] (non-convex hexagon) with interior angles of 72°, 72°, 216°, 72°, 72°, 216°;
* a [[rhombus]] with interior angles of 72°, 108°, 72°, 108°; and
* a regular [[pentagon]] with five interior angles of 108°.

These modules have their own specific Persian names:  The quadrilateral tile is called Torange,  the pentagonal tile is called Pange, the concave octagonal tile is called Shesh Band , the bow tie tile is called Sormeh Dan, decagram tile is called Tabl. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarhangi|first=Reza|date=|title=Interlocking Star Polygons in Persian Architecture: The Special Case of the Decagram in Mosaic Designs|url=|journal=Nexus Netw J|volume=14|pages=350|via=JSTORE}}&lt;/ref&gt;All sides of these figures have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s). All of them, except the pentagon, have bilateral (reflection) symmetry through two perpendicular lines. Some have additional symmetries. Specifically, the decagon has tenfold [[rotational symmetry]] (rotation by 36°); and the pentagon has fivefold rotational symmetry (rotation by 72°). 

== The Emergence of Girih Tiles ==
By the late 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the Islamic artists in North Africa start to use “tile mosaic”, which is the predecessor of tessellation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islam : art and architecture|last=Hattstein /Delius.|first=Markus/Peter|publisher=Potsdam : H.F. Ullmann|year=2013|isbn=3848003805|location=|pages=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; . By 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the Islamic discovered a new way to construct the “tile mosaic” due to the development of arithmetic calculation and geometry—the girih tiles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu/Steinhardt|first=Peter/Paul|date=2007|title=Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture|url=|journal=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20039057|volume=315|pages=2|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Girih==

[[Girih]] are lines ([[strapwork]]) that decorate the tiles. The tiles are used to form girih patterns, from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, meaning "knot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sebastian R. Prange |date=September–October 2009 | title = The Tiles of Infinity | journal = Saudi Aramco World | pages = 24–31 | url = http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200905/the.tiles.of.infinity.htm
}}{{deadlink|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, only the girih (and other minor decorations like flowers) are visible rather than the boundaries of the tiles themselves. The girih are piece-wise straight lines that cross the boundaries of the tiles at the center of an edge at 54° (3π/10) to the edge. Two intersecting girih cross each edge of a tile. Most tiles have a unique pattern of girih inside the tile that are continuous and follow the symmetry of the tile. However, the decagon has two possible girih patterns one of which has only fivefold rather than tenfold rotational symmetry.

== Mathematics of girih tilings ==


In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu|Peter J. Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt|Paul J. Steinhardt]] suggested that girih tilings possessed properties consistent with [[self-similar]] [[fractal]] [[quasicrystalline]] tilings such as [[Penrose tiling]]s, predating them by five centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peter J. Lu and Paul J. Steinhardt | year = 2007 | title = Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 315 | pages = 1106–1110 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5815/1106.full | doi = 10.1126/science.1135491
 | pmid = 17322056 | issue = 5815 | bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf Supplemental figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326095515/http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding was supported both by analysis of patterns on surviving structures, and by examination of 15th-century Persian scrolls. However, we have no indication of how much more the architects may have known about the mathematics involved. It is generally believed that such designs were constructed by drafting zigzag outlines with only a straightedge and a compass. Templates found on scrolls such as the 97-foot- (29.5 metres) long [[Topkapi Scroll]] may have been consulted. Found in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in Istanbul, the administrative center of the Ottoman Empire and believed to date from the late 15th century, the scroll shows a succession of two- and three- dimensional geometric patterns. There is no text, but there is a grid pattern and color-coding used to highlight symmetries and distinguish three-dimensional projections. Drawings such as shown on this scroll would have served as pattern-books for the artisans who fabricated the tiles, and the shapes of the girih tiles dictated how they could be combined into large patterns. In this way, craftsmen could make highly complex designs without resorting to mathematics and without necessarily understanding their underlying principles.&lt;ref name="Topkapi"&gt;{{cite book | author = Gulru Necipoglu  | year = 1995 | title = The Topkapi Scroll:  Geometry and Ornament in Islamic Architecture | publisher = Getty Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of repeating patterns created from a limited number of geometric shapes available to craftsmen of the day is similar to the practice of contemporary European [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] artisans. Designers of both styles were concerned with using their inventories of geometrical shapes to create the maximum diversity of forms. This demanded a skill and practice very different from mathematics.&lt;ref name="Topkapi"/&gt;

=== Geometric construction of an interlocking decagram-polygon mosaic design ===
Firstly, divide the right angle A into five parts with same degree by creating four rays that start from A. Find an arbitrary point C on the second ray and drop perpendiculars from C to the sides of angle A counter-clockwise. This step creates the rectangle ABCD along with four segments that each has an endpoint at A and other endpoints are the intersections of the four rays with the two sides of BC and DC of rectangle ABCD. Then, find the midpoint of the fourth segment created from the fourth ray point E. Construct an arc with center A and radius AE to intersect AB at point F and the second ray at point G. The second segment is now a part of the rectangle’s diagonal. Make a line, parallel to AD and passing through point G, that intersects the first ray at point H and the third ray at point I. The line HF passes through point E and intersects the third ray at L and line AD at J. Construct a line, passing through J which is parallel to the third ray. Also construct line EI and find M which is the intersection of this line with AD. From the point F make a parallel line to the third ray to meet the first ray at K. Construct segments GK, GL, and EM. Find the point N such that GI = IN by constructing a circle with center I and radius IG. Construct the line DN which is parallel to GK, to intersect the line emanate from J, to find P to complete the regular pentagon EINPJ. Line DN meets the perpendicular bisector of AB at Q. From Q construct a line parallel to FK to intersect ray MI at R. As shown in the figure, using O which is the center of the rectangle ABCD, as a center of rotation for 180°, one can make the fundamental region for the tiling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:WX20181125-203644@2x.png|thumb|An interlocking decagram-polygon mosaic design]]

=== Geometric construction of A tessellation from Mirza Akbar architectural scrolls ===
First, divide the right angle into five congruent angles, a arbitrary point P was selected on the first ray counterclockwise. For the radius of the circle inscribed in the decagram one half of the segment created from the third ray, segment AM, was selected. The following figure illustrates a step-by-step compass-straightedge visual solution to the problem by the author.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Note that the way to divide a right angle into five congruent angles is not a part of the instructions provided, because it is considered an elementary step for designers.

&lt;/gallery&gt;The girih has been widely applied on the architecture. To begin with, the patterns on the Persian geometric windows meet the need of the Persian architecture. “The specific types of embellishments utilized in orosi typically linked the windows to the patron’s social and political eminence.”The more ornate a window is, the higher social and economic status the owner is more likely to have. A good example for this would be Azad Koliji. The Azad Koliji is a Dowlatabad Garden in Iran. With the girih patterns on its window, the architects successfully demonstrate multiple layers. The first layer would be the actual garden which people can have a glimpse at when they open the window. In addition to this natural layer, the first girih pattern on the outside of the window (the carved pattern. Another artificial layer would be the colorful glasses on the window. The multi-color layer create a sense of a mass of flowers. This layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with the real layer outside the window, and gives the audience enough space to imagine.

When Sedki founded [[Dubai]]-based publishing house, Pageflip,&lt;ref name="Goodmanga"/&gt; he wrote that he wanted to fight the perception that Classical Arabic, associated with schoolwork, was "boring." To help form his comic, Sedki approached a female duo of comic book artists, known under the pen name, Akira Himekawa, and asked for consultation on how to best express the manga style.&lt;ref name="NeildManga"/&gt; The Himekawa duo became the artists of the books.&lt;ref name="Goodmanga"/&gt; ''Gold Ring'' was awarded the 2010 [[Sheikh Zayed Book Award]] for children's literature.&lt;ref name="NeildManga"/&gt;

==Story==
The story revolves around Sultan, an Arab boy who watches the Gold Ring [[falconry]] competition with his friend Ziad. At the competition they find a caged falcon. Sultan convinces his friend to release the falcon into the wild. The next morning, the falcon is at Sultan's doorstep. Sultan calls the bird "'''Majd'''" and trains her for an upcoming falconry competition.

==Background==
{{further|Polish Armed Forces in the West}}
[[File:Barony Castle Hotel, Eddleston near Peebles, Scotland.JPG|thumb|Barony Castle Hotel in 2011]]
[[Black Barony]]'s connection with Polish Forces during the Second World War dates from early 1942, when the hotel, established in 1926, was requisitioned for use as the main [[Staff college|Staff College]] for training Polish officers in Scotland.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt;

After the [[Battle of France|Fall of France]] in May 1940, the Polish Army in Scotland was reorganised as the [[I Corps in the West (Poland)|1st Polish Corps]] and entrusted by the [[War Office]] with the defence of a long stretch of the country's east coast between [[Arbroath]] (later extended to [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], 38 miles (61&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[Dundee]]) and [[Burntisland]] on the [[Firth of Forth]] against a possible invasion from [[German occupation of Norway|German-occupied Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Ziarski-Kernberg, ''The Polish Community In Scotland'', Caldra House 2000, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; The Poles strengthened existing defences by installing anti-tank obstacles, building pill boxes and patrolling the coastline in armoured trains. In early 1942 they gave up responsibility for [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], taking over instead the defences of [[East Lothian]].&lt;ref&gt;G Barclay,''If Hitler Comes.

Following the formation of the [[1st Armoured Division (Poland)|1st Polish Armoured Division]] in February 1942, Polish troops under the command of [[Stanisław Maczek|General Stanisław Maczek]] trained in [[Perthshire]], [[East Lothian]], [[Berwickshire]], and [[East Anglia]] before taking part in the [[Normandy landings]] of 1944. In the Normandy campaign they played a conspicuous part in the [[Falaise pocket|Battle of the Falaise Gap]],&lt;ref&gt;For the Poles' contribution at Falaise, see http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/46/a2450846.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and in the liberation of the [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;For photographs from General Maczek's own picture diary from the campaign, see http://www.makers.org.uk/place/breda&lt;/ref&gt; and defeat of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]]. After the war and the [[Eastern Bloc#Poland|Communist take-over in Poland]], many of the Polish soldiers in the West, including General Maczek, were unwilling to return to Poland, where their personal freedom was far from assured. Many settled in Britain, particularly in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;T. Ziarski-Kernberg, ''The Polish Community In Scotland'', Caldra House 2000, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The large concrete map of Scotland (with the omission of the remote [[Northern Isles]]) was the idea of Jan Tomasik, a sergeant in the 1st Armoured Division, who during the war had been stationed in [[Galashiels]], about 14 miles (22&amp;nbsp;km) from the castle.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt; He bought the hotel at Black Barony in 1968. In the early 1960s, finding his old wartime commander, like all Polish veterans, denied a war pension as a non-UK citizen, Tomasik employed Maczek in various jobs, including barman, in his Edinburgh hotel.&lt;ref name=Stachura&gt;{{cite book|last=Stachura|first=Peter|title=The Poles in Britain, 1940-2000: From Betrayal to Assimilation|year=2004|publisher=Frank Cass|isbn=0714684449|page=53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjPjUBnucDcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A0714684449&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q=barman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; A friendship developed between the two men, and in the 1970s Tomasik provided a room for Maczek to enjoy summer breaks with his family in his newly refurbished hotel at Barony Castle.&lt;ref name=gfs /&gt; This has led to speculation that Maczek, with his tank commander's interest in topography, may have had some input into the map, though that has never been established on the basis of evidence.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt;

The precise reasons why Tomasik created the map are unclear. It is known that Polish soldiers created an outline map of Poland on the ground at [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire|Douglas]] in Lanarkshire in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ostrycharz.free-online.co.uk/Douglas.html Arrival of Strangers&lt;/ref&gt; in the very camp where Tomasik was stationed after arriving in Britain. It is also known that he was fascinated by a large scale-model map of Belgium, which he saw at the [[Expo 58|Brussels World's Fair]] of 1958 on his way to visit relations in Poland. This map appears to have been the direct inspiration for the map at Barony Castle, though it is also possible that the wartime model may have been an influence.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt; Tomasik seems to have regarded the Barony map primarily as an added attraction for his hotel guests, expecting it also to draw sightseers. However, he is also on record as having said to hotel patrons that he wanted to show the country the Poles had defended during the war and was planning to invite [[George VI]]'s consort [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]] to open the map officially. He told them that the map was to be his legacy, describing it as "a gift to the [[Scottish people]]" for the hospitality the Scots had shown the Poles during the war years.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt; Tomasik died in 1991.

==Construction==

The map was designed by Dr. Kazimierz Trafas, a young cartographer from the [[Jagiellonian University]] of [[Krakow]].&lt;ref name=gfs /&gt; Despite the tensions of the [[Cold War]], links between Scotland and Polish universities had been good since the late 1960s, when [[Threshold model|threshold analysis]] techniques in town and regional planning devised in Poland were refined and applied in Scotland for the Scottish Development Department.&lt;ref&gt;Boleslaw Malisz, Physical Planning for the Development of Satellite and New Towns: The Analysis of Urban Development Possibilities; Research Institute for Town Planning &amp; Architecture, Warsaw. Institute Papers 113 (1966); Jerzy Kowalowski, "Threshold Analysis-an Economic Tool for Town and Regional Planning", ''Urban Studies'', June 1968 5: 132-143; Scottish Development Department, ''Threshold Analysis Manual'': Edinburgh, HMSO (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Great Polish Map Of Scotland (Mapa Scotland), Barony Castle.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|right|The map facing northwards from England.]]
On a visit to Poland, Tomasik discussed his idea of the map with [[Mieczysław Klimaszewski|Professor Klimaszewski]], head of the Jagiellonian University's Institute of Geography, vice-rector of the university and member of the Polish Council of State. Klimaszweski entrusted the task to Dr. Trafas who took charge of the project.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt;

The '''Great Polish Map of Scotland'', as it has been christened by the group planning to restore it, took six consecutive summers between 1974 and 1979 to construct, although the bulk of the work was accomplished by the late summer of 1976.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt; In 1974, Trafas arrived in Scotland with his departmental colleague Roman Wolnik, surveyed the site and marked out the outline of the map to a scale of 1:10,000. The shapes of the mainland and islands were made with vertical shuttering and 300m, 600m and 900m contours laid in four-brick courses. Locations were correlated with a set of [[Collins Bartholomew|Bartholomew]]'s survey maps of Scotland by means of a reference grid.&lt;ref name="Janus Szewczuk"&gt;[http://www.mapascotland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Szewczuk-Scotland-in-Scotland-translation-Jan.-20142.pdf Janus Szewczuk describes the building of the Great Map], Szkockja w Szkockja (Scotland in Scotland), published on mapascotland.org. Retrieved 16 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following summer, Tomasik revisited Poland, returning with Trafas, Wolnik and three Krakow University employees hired under contract to provide the manual labour to construct the concrete map. The hotel manager Marek Raton, a son-in-law of Tomasik, and hotel maintenance man Bill Robson also worked on the project, especially the excavation of the surrounding pit. Some of the labour was supplied by hiring Polish exchange students visiting Britain.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt; The body of the map was gradually built up by infilling the prepared outlines with cement. Mountain summits were marked by vertical rods, their heights exaggerated five times relative to the horizontal scale to increase the visual effect. This was a standard traditionally adopted for British military terrain maps.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt; The topography was then finished off by manually sculpting the landforms according to the contours shown on the Bartholomew maps.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt;

After the last visit of the Polish cartographers in 1977, hotel employees and members of the Tomasik family continued to work on the map intermittently over two more summers before it was completed in 1979.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt; The surface was painted with forests, urban areas, major roads and lochs shown. A wall was built around the map to create an oval-shaped basin, 1.5m deep. This was then supplied with water diverted from a nearby stream to create the seas and [[loch]]s. The gravity-fed water also flowed through submerged pipes to the major river sources. The original plan to construct a metal walkway over the model to serve as a viewing platform never materialised.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt;

Professor Trafas, the chief designer and builder of the map, died in 2004.&lt;ref name="Janus Szewczuk" /&gt;

==Restoration==

After the sale of the hotel in 1985, parts of the map deteriorated slowly over the years and, while it remains generally substantial, some of the concrete is now in a fragile and ruinous condition.&lt;ref name="mapascotland" /&gt; In 2010, a group of volunteers calling themselves Mapa Scotland was formed which secured [[category B listed]] for the map from [[Historic Scotland]] in 2012&lt;ref name=listed&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Polish Map of Scotland granted listed status|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-19622243|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aims to restore it to its original condition while promoting it as a heritage monument, educational resource and visitor attraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/south_of_scotland/8664441.stm 'Team aims to restore 3D Scotland map at Borders castle'], BBC News, 6 May 2010.

The then Polish Consul General in Scotland, Tomasz Trafas, brother of Professor Trafas, said in a newspaper interview that the map is "a rare symbol of the broader heritage and a symbol of the cultural links between Poland and Scotland since the 16th century that is worth preserving for the benefit of the local community and wider nation".&lt;ref name=herald /&gt;

The '''Hayworth Theatre''' is a theater and performing arts center at 2511 Wilshire Boulevard in the [[Westlake, Los Angeles|Westlake neighborhood]] of [[Los Angeles, California]]. The facility houses 99-seat, 42-seat and 49-seat auditoriums and a 1,500 square-foot ballroom used for rehearsals, classes, and special events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/1170 http://cinematreasures.org:Hayworth Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designated as a cultural-historic landmark by the city of Los Angeles in 1983.&lt;ref name=moviepals&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/wilshiremoviepalaces/hayworth Movie Palaces along Wilshire Boulevard: Hayworth Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The building that houses the Hayworth is significant due to its association with [[Stiles O. Clements]] of the architectural firm [[Morgan, Walls &amp; Clements]], who designed many other Los Angeles theatres as well as many of the buildings in the Wishire historical district. It originally opened in 1926 as the Masque Theatre, a  playhouse. The structure is in the [[Spanish Colonial Revival style]], also called the [[Spanish_Colonial_architecture#Spanish_Colonial_architecture|ornate Churriqueresque]] style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatreinla.com/theatredetail.php?theatreID=19 theatreinla.com:The Hayworth]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1950 the building was renovated by architect Dwight Gibbs and became the Vagabond, a movie theatre. The Vagabond lasted as a movie theater for several decades but finally went out of business in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-28/entertainment/ca-9291_1_vagabond-theatre John M. Wilson, "Vagabond Theatre Fades Out" ''Los Angeles Times,'' November 28, 1985]''&lt;/ref&gt; For a time the site was occupied by an evangelical church.

The La Fonda Restaurant Building was designated Historic-Cultural Monument No. 268 on June 24, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;City of Los Angeles Office of Historic Resources [http://preservation.lacity.org/commission/designated-historic-cultural-monuments "Historic-Cultural Monument List"] Accessed 14 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This restaurant, established in 1968, shared the building but closed in early 2014.&lt;ref Name=New/&gt; The Hayworth Theatre Company became resident here in 2006.The theatre housed award-winning theater company [http://NewAmericanTheatre.com/ The New American Theatre] from 2006-2011. Artistic Director and actor [[Jack Stehlin]] performed there, as well as other notable actors such as [[Alfred Molina]], [[Katie Lowes]],[[Jill Gascoine]], and [[Robert Cicchini]].   &lt;ref name=moviepals/&gt;  TV writer [[Jenji Kohan]] purchased the building in November 2013. Her husband and business partner, [[Christopher Noxon]], indicated that she is planning on using the second floor as production offices for writers and editors on her TV shows.&lt;ref Name=New&gt;Ng, David (March 13, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-hayworth-theatre-20140313,0,6789320.story "Historic Hayworth Theatre is entering a new stage of life"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017,former [[The Improv|Hollywood Improv]] booker and artistic director [http://jamieflam.com/ Jamie Flam] launched a [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jamieflam/a-new-entertainment-experience-in-a-historic-la-th?ref=video kickstarter campaign] to reopen the venue under the name [https://www.dynastytypewriter.com/ Dynasty Typewriter at The Hayworth].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1986">'''Imitation''' is the doctrine of [[artistic creativity]] according to which the creative process should be based on the close imitation of the [[masterpiece]]s of the preceding [[author]]s. This concept was first formulated by [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] in the first century BCE as ''[[Dionysian imitatio|imitatio]]'', and has since dominated for almost two thousand years the Western [[history of the arts]] and [[classicism]];&lt;ref name="Shroder72p282"&gt;Shroder (1972) p.282 quote: {{quotation|The doctrine of imitation, to which Nodier indirectly refers, had of course dominated classicism from its inception, when Du Bellay recommended it in the ''Defense et illustration de la langue francaise''. The rejection of that doctrine was a basic tenet of romanticism; as Hugo put it in his preface to the 1826 edition of ''Odes et ballades, 'celui qui imite un poete ''romantique'' devient necessairement ''classique'', puisqu'il imite''.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 18th century, [[Romanticism]] reversed it with the creation of the institution of [[romantic originality]].&lt;ref name="Shroder72p282"/&gt; In the 20th century, the [[modernist]] and [[postmodern]] movements in turn discarded the romantic idea of creativity, and heightened the practice of imitation, copying, plagiarism, rewriting, appropriation and so on as the central [[Literary technique|artistic device]].

'''Installation art''' is an artistic genre of [[three-dimensional]] works that often are [[site-specific art|site-specific]] and designed to transform the perception of a space. Generally, the term is applied to interior spaces, whereas exterior interventions are often called [[public art]], [[land art]] or [[intervention art]]; however, the boundaries between these terms overlap.

[[File:Art exhibit at ALMA.jpg|thumb|A golf ball of enormous proportions alongside the antennas at an altitude of 5000 meters above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artistic Apparition at ALMA|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15048/|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Installation art can be either temporary or permanent. Installation artworks have been constructed in exhibition spaces such as museums and galleries, as well as public and private spaces. The genre incorporates a broad range of everyday and natural materials, which are often chosen for their "evocative" qualities, as well as [[new media]] such as [[video]], [[sound]], [[performance]], [[immersive virtual reality]] and the [[internet]]. Many installations are [[Site-Specific Art|site-specific]] in that they are designed to exist only in the space for which they were created, appealing to qualities evident in a three-dimensional immersive medium. Artistic collectives such as the [[AMNH Exhibitions Lab|Exhibition Lab]] at New York's [[American Museum of Natural History]] created environments to showcase the natural world in as realistic a medium as possible. Likewise, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] employed a similar philosophy when designing the multiple immersive spaces for [[Disneyland]] in 1955. Since its acceptance as a separate discipline, a number of institutions focusing on Installation art were created. These included the [[Mattress Factory]], Pittsburgh, the Museum of Installation in London, and the [[Fairy Doors of Ann Arbor, MI]], among others.

Installation art came to prominence in the 1970s but its roots can be identified in earlier artists such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] and his use of the [[readymade]] and [[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Merz'' art objects, rather than more traditional [[craft]] based [[sculpture]]. The "intention" of the artist is paramount in much later installation art whose roots lie in the [[conceptual art]] of the 1960s. This again is a departure from traditional sculpture which places its focus on [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]]. Early non-Western installation art includes events staged by the [[Gutai group]] in Japan starting in 1954, which influenced American installation pioneers like [[Allan Kaprow]].

==Installation==
[[File:Petzel shapes.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Allan McCollum]].''The Shapes Project'', 2005/06]]
''Installation'' as nomenclature for a specific form of art came into use fairly recently; its first use as documented by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1969. It was coined in this context, in reference to a form of art that had arguably existed since prehistory but was not regarded as a discrete category until the mid-twentieth century. [[Allan Kaprow]] used the term "Environment" in 1958 (Kaprow 6) to describe his transformed indoor spaces; this later joined such terms as "project art" and "temporary art."

Essentially, installation/environmental art takes into account a broader sensory experience, rather than floating framed points of focus on a "neutral" wall or displaying isolated objects (literally) on a pedestal. This may leave [[space]] and [[time]] as its only dimensional constants, implying dissolution of the line between "art" and "life"; Kaprow noted that "if we bypass 'art' and take nature itself as a model or point of departure, we may be able to devise a different kind of art... out of the sensory stuff of ordinary life".

==Gesamtkunstwerk==
The conscious act of artistically addressing all the senses with regard to a total experience made a resounding debut in 1849 when [[Richard Wagner]] conceived of a ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', or an operatic work for the stage that drew inspiration from ancient [[Greek theater]] in its inclusion of all the major art forms: [[painting]], [[writing]], [[music]], etc. (Britannica). In devising operatic works to commandeer the audience's senses, Wagner left nothing unobserved: [[architecture]], ambience, and even the [[audience]] itself were considered and manipulated in order to achieve a state of total artistic immersion. In the book "Themes in Contemporary Art", it is suggested that "installations in the 1980s and 1990s were increasingly characterized by networks of operations involving the interaction among complex architectural settings, environmental sites and extensive use of everyday objects in ordinary contexts. With the advent of video in 1965, a concurrent strand of installation evolved through the use of new and ever-changing technologies, and what had been simple video installations expanded to include complex interactive, multimedia and virtual reality environments".

==Art and Objecthood==
[[File:Franzoesischer Dom - Festival of Lights 2011.jpg|thumb|''Guardians of Time'', [[Manfred Kielnhofer]], [[Festival of Lights (Berlin)]] French Cathedral, Berlin, Velotaxi 2011]]
In "Art and Objecthood", [[Michael Fried]] derisively labels art that acknowledges the viewer as "theatrical" (Fried 45). There is a strong parallel between installation and theater: both play to a viewer who is expected to be at once immersed in the [[perception|sensory]]/[[narrative]] experience that surrounds him and maintain a degree of self-identity as a viewer. The traditional theater-goer does not forget that he has come in from outside to sit and take in a created experience; a trademark of installation art has been the curious and eager viewer, still aware that he is in an exhibition setting and tentatively exploring the novel universe of the installation.

The artist and critic [[Ilya Kabakov]] mentions this essential phenomenon in the introduction to his lectures "On the "Total" Installation": "[One] is simultaneously both a 'victim' and a viewer, who on the one hand surveys and evaluates the installation, and on the other, follows those associations, recollections which arise in him[;] he is overcome by the intense atmosphere of the total illusion". Here installation art bestows an unprecedented importance on the observer's inclusion in that which he observes. The expectations and social habits that the viewer takes with him into the space of the installation will remain with him as he enters, to be either applied or negated once he has taken in the new environment. What is common to nearly all installation art is a consideration of the experience in toto and the problems it may present, namely the constant conflict between disinterested criticism and sympathetic involvement. [[Television]] and [[video]] offer somewhat immersive experiences, but their unrelenting control over the [[rhythm]] of passing time and the arrangement of images precludes an intimately personal viewing experience. Ultimately, the only things a viewer can be assured of when experiencing the work are his own thoughts and preconceptions and the basic rules of space and time. All else may be molded by the artist's hands.

The central importance of the [[Subjective experience|subjective]] point of view when experiencing installation art, points toward a disregard for traditional [[Platonism|Platonic]] image theory. In effect, the entire installation adopts the character of the [[simulacrum]] or flawed [[statue]]: it neglects any ideal form in favor of optimizing its direct appearance to the observer. Installation art operates fully within the realm of sensory perception, in a sense "installing" the viewer into an artificial system with an appeal to his subjective perception as its ultimate goal.

==Interactive installations==

[[Image:Maurizio bolognini genoa.JPG|210px|thumb|An urban interactive art installation by [[Maurizio Bolognini]] (Genoa, 2005), which everybody can modify by using a cell phone.]]
An [[Interactive Art|interactive installation]] frequently involves the audience acting on the work of art or the piece responding to users' activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Younis|first1=Lauren|title=Hearts and Scissors Exhibit to Open|url=http://bl-ids-website.ads.iu.edu/news/story.aspx?id=66728|accessdate=23 November 2014|date=March 5, 2009|quote="Installation art can facilitate a direct, immediate interaction with the viewer," [Cindy] Hinant said.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several kinds of interactive installations that artists produce, these include [[Internet art|web]]-based installations (e.g., [[Telegarden]]), [[Art gallery|gallery]]-based installations, [[Digital art|digital]]-based installations, [[Electronics|electronic]]-based installations, [[IPhone art|mobile]]-based installations, etc. Interactive installations appeared mostly at end of the 1980s (''Legible City'' by [[Jeffrey Shaw]], ''La plume'' by [[Edmond Couchot]], Michel Bret...)  and became a genre during the 1990s, when artists became particularly interested in using the participation of the audiences to activate and reveal the meaning of the installation.

==Immersive virtual reality==

With the improvement of [[technology]] over the years, artists are more able to explore outside of the boundaries that were never able to be explored by artists in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Media (arts)|media]] used are more experimental and bold; they are also usually cross media and may involve sensors, which plays on the reaction to the audiences' movement when looking at the installations. By using virtual reality as a medium, [[immersive virtual reality]] art is probably the most deeply interactive form of art.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Immersive Ideals / Critical Distances''. [[LAP Lambert Academic Publishing]]. 2009, pp. 367-368&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing the spectator to "visit" the representation, the artist creates "situations to live" vs "spectacle to watch".&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Benayoun]], ''Maurice Benayoun Open Art'', Nouvelles éditions Scala, 2011, French version, {{ISBN|978-2-35988-046-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministry of Science, Research and Technology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For a corporation, the result will optimize its [[stock price]].

The [[International Financial Reporting Standards|IFRS]] (International Financial Reporting Standards) committee developed the International Accounting System 38 with the purpose of prescribing the accounting treatment for intangible assets. IAS 38.8 defines an intangible asset as an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance. An asset is a resource that is controlled by the entity as the result of past events (for example purchase or self-creation) and from which future economic benefits (inflows of cash or other benefits) are expected.

==Classification==
Intellectual capital is normally classified as follows:

*'''[[Human capital]]''', the value that the employees of a business provide through the application of [[Skill|skills]], [[know-how]] and [[expertise]].&lt;ref name="Maddocks"&gt;Maddocks, J. &amp; Beaney, M. 2002. See the invisible and intangible. Knowledge Management, March, 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Human capital is an organization’s combined human capability for solving business problems and exploiting its [[Intellectual Property|intellectual property]]. Human capital is inherent in people and cannot be owned by an organization. Therefore, human capital can leave an organization when people leave, and if the [[management]] has failed to provide a setting where others can pick up their know-how. Human capital also encompasses how effectively an organization uses its people resources as measured by [[creativity]] and [[Innovation]].
*'''[[Structural capital]]''', the supportive non-physical infrastructure, processes and [[Database|databases]] of the organisation that enable human capital to function.&lt;ref name="Maddocks" /&gt; Structural capital includes processes, [[Patent|patents]], and [[Trademark|trademarks]], as well as the organization’s image, [[Organizational structure|organization]], [[information system]], and proprietary [[software]] and databases. Because of its diverse components, structural capital can be classified further into organization, process and innovation capital. [[Organizational capital]] includes the organization philosophy and systems for leveraging the organization’s capability. Process capital includes the techniques, procedures, and programs that implement and enhance the delivery of goods and services. Innovation capital includes [[intellectual property]] such as patents, trademarks and [[Copyright|copyrights]], and intangible assets.&lt;ref&gt;Edvinsson, L. &amp; Malone, M.S. 1997. Intellectual Capital: Realizing your Company’s True Value by Finding Its Hidden Roots. New York: Harper Business.&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectual properties are protected commercial rights such as patents, [[Trade secret|trade secrets]], copyrights and trademarks. Intangible assets are all of the other talents and theory by which an organization is run.
*'''[[Relational capital]]''', consisting of such elements as [[customer]] relationships, supplier relationships, trademarks and [[Trade name|trade names]] (which have value only by virtue of customer relationships) [[License|licences]], and [[Franchising|franchises]]. The notion that customer capital is separate from human and structural capital indicates its central importance to an organization’s worth.&lt;ref&gt;Skyrme, D.J. 1998. Valuing Knowledge: Is it Worth it?&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the relationships a business maintains with its customers and suppliers is also referred as goodwill, but often poorly booked in corporate accounts, because of accounting rules.&lt;ref&gt;Marc M. Levey and Steven C. Wrappe:  Transfer Pricing, Rules, Compliance and Controversy, 2nd edition; CCH, Wolters Kluwer, 2007, p.129-139]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
The intangible nature of many knowledge products and processes, in combination with the increasing importance of their value in corporate balance sheets leads to a growing interest in management of intellectual capital. Creating, shaping and updating the stock of intellectual capital requires the formulation of a strategic vision, which blends together all three dimensions of intellectual capital (Human, Structural and Relational Capital) within the organisational context through exploration and exploitation, measurement and disclosure&lt;ref&gt;Khavandkar, Ehsan, Theodorakopoulos, Nicholas, Hart, Mark, &amp; Preston, Jude (2016).

Brown (Eds.), Human Resource Management, Innovation and Performance (pp. 213–231). London: Palgrave Macmillan UK.&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, the organisational value of intellectual capital is developed via an ongoing and emergent process focused on the capability to leverage, develop and change the dimensions&lt;ref&gt;Subramaniam, Mohan, &amp; Youndt, Mark (2005). [http://amj.aom.org/content/48/3/450.abstract The Influence of Intellectual Capital on the Types of Innovative Capabilities]. Academy of Management Journal, 48(3), 450–463.&lt;/ref&gt;. The management of intellectual capital is conceptualised as occurring via a multiple stage process, governed by an evolutionary logic. The intellectual capital management is defined as a cycle of four inter-related sets of practices: Strategic Alignment, Exploration and Exploitation, Measurement and Reporting of intellectual capital&lt;ref&gt;Khavand Kar, Jalil &amp; Khavandkar, Ehsan (2013), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BnseAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA387&amp;pg=PA387#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Intellectual Capital: Management, Development and Measurement Models]", 3rd edition, Ministry of Science, Research and Technology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Measurement==
An intellectual capital audit is an [[audit]] of a company’s intellectual capital to monitor and oversee the intellectual capital of a firm in order to capitalize on intellectual capital already within the company, and to identify opportunities to increase the intellectual capital of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Brooking, A. (1996) Intellectual Capital, Core Assets for the Third Millennium Enterprise, International Thomson Business Press, London, pp.86&lt;/ref&gt;

Early methods of intellectual capital measurement include the balanced scorecard framework (BSC), the Skandia Navigator, and the Intangible Asset Monitor. Additionally, the Value-Added Intellectual Coefficient method (VAIC) was introduced in 1993 to measure the ''value'' created by intellectual capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gianpaolo Iazzolino|last2=Domenico Laise|date=2013-10-21|title=Value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC): A methodological and critical review|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/JIC-12-2012-0107|journal=Journal of Intellectual Capital|volume=14|issue=4|pages=547–563|doi=10.1108/jic-12-2012-0107|issn=1469-1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Judith Wright Centre of Contemporary Arts''' is a performing arts center in [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]].  The venue was renovated and re-opened as an arts centre in October 2001. The Centre is named after [[Judith Wright]], who was a celebrated Queensland poet&lt;ref name="aq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.qld.gov.au/arts/judithwright.html |title=Judith Wright Centre |publisher=Arts Queensland |accessdate=6 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011130/http://www.arts.qld.gov.au/arts/judithwright.html |archivedate=18 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an advocate for Indigenous rights and an environmental activist. Wright was one of two Australian poets considered for the Nobel Prize for Literature. She died June 25, 2000 in Canberra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mcilroy|first=Jim|title=Judith Wright, 1915-2000|url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/22006|work=GLW issue 411, Wednesday, July 12, 2000|publisher=Green Left Weekly|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre is managed by the [[Government of Queensland|Queensland Government]] through Arts Queensland. Affectionately called The Judy, is located at corner Berwick Street and 420 Brunswick Street in [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]].

The venue includes performance spaces that are well equipped for lighting, sound and AV and the three rehearsal studios for dance, theatre and music feature natural light.  The audience experience is intimate with a relaxed welcoming style of cabaret and racked seating.   The main performance space is a black box style with plenty of flexibility to stage a diverse range of performances.

'''Kaija Anneli Saariaho''' ({{IPA-fi|ˈkɑi̯jɑ ˈsɑːriɑho|lang}}; née ''Laakkonen'', born 14 October 1952) is a Finnish composer based in Paris, France.

Saariaho studied composition in Helsinki, [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], and Paris, where she has lived since 1982. Her research at the [[IRCAM|Institute for Research and Coordination Acoustic (IRCAM)]] marked a turning point in her music away from strict [[serialism]] towards [[spectralism]]. Her characteristically rich, [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] textures are often created by combining live music and electronics.

During the course of her career, Saariaho has received commissions from the [[Lincoln Center]] for the [[Kronos Quartet]] and from [[IRCAM]] for the [[Ensemble Intercontemporain]], the [[BBC]], the [[New York Philharmonic]], the [[Salzburg Music Festival]], the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in Paris, and the [[Finnish National Opera]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;"Kaija Saariaho (1952–)." Ondine (album label). N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://www.ondine.net/?cid=4.2&amp;oid=614&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Saariaho was born in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. She studied at the [[Sibelius Academy]] under [[Paavo Heininen]]. After attending the [[Darmstadt School|Darmstadt Summer Courses]], she moved to Germany to study at the [[Hochschule für Musik Freiburg]] under [[Brian Ferneyhough]] and [[Klaus Huber]]. She found her teachers' emphasis on [[Serialism|strict serialism]] and mathematical structures stifling, saying in an interview:

{{quote|You were not allowed to have pulse, or tonally oriented harmonies, or melodies. I don't want to write music through negations. Everything is permissible as long as it's done in good taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodbowl.com/search/?q=cristal|title=Du cristal|publisher=Hollywood Bowl (website)|author=Howard Posner|accessdate=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1980, Saariaho went to the Darmstadt Summer Courses and attended a concert of the French [[Spectral music|spectralists]] [[Tristan Murail]] and [[Gerard Grisey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Alex. "Birth." ''The New Yorker.'' Condé Nast, 24 Apr. 2006. Web. 20 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/04/24/birth&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hearing spectral music for the first time marked a profound shift in Saariaho's artistic direction. These experiences guided her decision to attend courses in [[computer music]] that were being given by [[IRCAM]], the computer music research institute in Paris, by David Wessel, Jean-Baptiste Barrière, and Marc Battier.

In 1982, she began work at IRCAM researching computer analyses of the sound-spectrum of individual notes produced by different instruments. She developed techniques for computer-assisted composition, experimented with ''[[musique concrète]]'', and wrote her first pieces combining live performance with electronics. She also composed new works using IRCAM's CHANT synthesiser.&lt;ref&gt;"The CHANT Project: From the Synthesis of the Singing Voice to Synthesis in General". Rodet, Xavier; Potard, Yves; Barriere, Jean-Baptiste. ''Computer Music Journal'', Vol. 8, No. 3 (Autumn, 1984), p. 30. The MIT Press. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3679810. Accessed 2015-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of her Jardin Secret trilogy was created with the use of computer programs. ''Jardin secret I'' (1985), ''Jardin secret II'' (1986), and ''Nymphea (Jardin secret III)'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Tim; Hargreaves, Jon; Rofe, Michael. ''Kaija Saariaho: visions, narratives, dialogues''. Ashgate, 2011. 82-85&lt;/ref&gt; Her works with electronics were developed in collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Barrière, a composer, multimedia artist, and computer scientist who directed the IRCAM's department of musical research from 1984 to 1987. Saariaho and Barrière married in 1982. They have two children.&lt;ref name="Ellison"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/07/arts/music-uncovering-beauty-in-ordinary-noise.html|title=Uncovering Beauty in Ordinary Noise|author=Cori Ellison|date=1999-11-07|work=New York Times|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Paris, Saariaho developed an emphasis on slow transformations of dense [[Sound mass|masses of sound]].&lt;ref&gt;"Biography: Kaija Saariaho." Kaija Saariaho (website). N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Aug. 2015. &lt;http://saariaho.org/biography/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her first tape piece, ''Vers Le Blanc'' from 1982, and her orchestral and tape work, ''Verblendungen'', are both constructed from a single transition: in ''Vers Le Blanc'' the transition is from one [[Tone cluster|pitch cluster]] to another, while in ''Verblendungen'', it is from loud to quiet. ''Verblendungen'' also uses a pair of visual ideas as its basis: a brush stroke which starts as a dense mark on the page and thins out into individual strands, and the word "verblendungen" itself, which means "dazzlements".&lt;ref&gt;"Verblendung", ''Langenscheidt's Condensed Muret-Sanders Dictionary'' (ed. Heinz Messinger and the Langenscheidt Editorial Staff), 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work in the 1980s and 1990s was marked by an emphasis on [[timbre]] and the use of [[electronic music|electronics]] alongside traditional instruments. ''Nymphéa (Jardin secret III)'' (1987), for example, is for [[string quartet]] and live electronics and contains an additional vocal element: the musicians whisper the words of an [[Arseny Tarkovsky]] poem, ''Now Summer is Gone''. In writing ''Nymphea'', Saariaho used a [[fractal]] generator to create material. Writing about the compositional process, Saariaho said:

{{quote|In preparing the musical material of the piece, I have used the computer in several ways. The basis of the entire harmonic structure is provided by complex cello sounds that I have analysed with the computer. The basic material for the rhythmic and melodic transformations are computer-calculated in which the musical motifs gradually convert, recurring again and again.&lt;ref&gt;Saariaho, Kaija. Programme Note: Nymphéa (1987). New York: Commissioned by the Lincoln Center and Doris &amp; Myron Beigler for the Kronos Quartet., 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Saariaho has often talked about having a kind of [[synaesthesia]], one that involves all of the senses, saying:

{{quote|... the visual and the musical world are one to me ... Different senses, shades of colour, or textures and tones of light, even fragrances and sounds blend in my mind. They form a complete world in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Moisala, P. (2009). ''Kaija Saariaho.'' Urbana: University of Illinois Press. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another example is ''Six Japanese Gardens'' (1994), a percussion piece accompanied by a prerecorded electronic layer of the Japanese nature, traditional instruments, and chanting of Buddhist monks. During her visit to Tokyo in 1993, she expanded her original percussion conception into a semi-[[Indeterminacy (music)|indeterminate]] piece. It consists of six movements that each represent a garden composed of traditional Japanese architecture, by which she was inspired rhythmically. Especially in movement IV and V, she explored many possibilities of complex [[polyrhythm]] in liberated instrumentation. She said:

{{quote|... I felt a connection between architecture and music: both art forms select and introduce materials, let them grow, give them form, prepare new contrasting elements, create different relations between the materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kaija Saariaho|last=Moisala|first=Pirkko|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=978-0-252-03277-6|location=USA|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In her book on Saariaho, musicologist Pirkko Moisala writes about the indeterminate nature of this composition:

{{quote|[Kaija said:] 'There are so many kinds of percussion instruments which I do not know. I thought that it would be most interesting to see how the musicians choose their instruments in certain passages.' the identity and character of the composition remains the same even when the instruments are changed; each musical idea requires certain kinds of sound color but not a particular instrument.}}

On 1 December 2016, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] gave its first performance of ''[[L'Amour de loin]]'', the first opera by a female composer to be staged by the company since 1903, and the second opera by a female composer ever to be presented at the Metropolitan Opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anthony Tommasini | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/arts/music/review-met-opera-amour-de-loin-kaija-saariaho.html | title=Review: A Newly Relevant ''L'Amour de Loin' at the Met | work=New York Times | date=2016-12-02 | accessdate=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent transmission of the opera to cinema on 10 December 2016 as part of the [[Metropolitan Opera Live in HD]] series marked the first opera by a female composer, and the first opera conducted by a female conductor ([[Susanna Mälkki]]), in the series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8204">'''Korean textbook controversy''' refers to controversial content in [[Government of South Korea|government]]-approved [[history]] textbooks used in the [[secondary education]] (high schools) in [[South Korea]]. The controversies primarily concern portrayal of [[North Korea]] and the description of the regime of the South Korean president and dictator [[Park Chung-hee]].

==Historical context==
The controversy's origins can be traced at least to 2013, when the South Korea's [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|Ministry of Education]] instructed publishers to revise their history textbooks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = South Korea's History Textbook Controversy|url = http://thediplomat.com/2015/04/south-koreas-history-textbook-controversy/|website = The Diplomat|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the South Korean [[National Institute of Korean History]] announced plans to replace existing history textbooks in high schools with one authorized version by March 2017.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A textbook war divides South Korea|url = http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-1022-kirk-south-korea-textbook-controversy-20151022-story.html|website = latimes.com|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state-issued textbooks are to be written by a government-appointed panel of experts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = South Korea accused of rewriting history over schoolbook policy|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/03/south-korea-accused-rewriting-history-schoolbook-policy|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-24|first = Agence|last = France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the larger context, this controversy is a part of an ongoing dispute on whether the state should control the content of history textbooks, and possibly enforce a monopoly, or whether individual schools (or teachers) should be free to choose their own textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chosun Ilbo "Debates" the Production of History|url = http://sinonk.com/2013/11/10/chosun-ilbo-debates-the-production-of-history/|website = Sino-NK|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Korea used to have a state control over textbooks until the rules were relaxed in 2003 leading to the appearance of several competing textbooks used since, particularly since 2010.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Existing textbooks have been criticized by the government as well as by the Korean right or conservative side for being too positive on North Korean topics, and for "liberal, left-leaning" bias.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Textbook controversy is over competing forms of nationalist history|url = https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/11/633_190233.html|website = koreatimes|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|title = South Korea to Issue State History Textbooks, Rejecting Private Publishers|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/world/asia/south-korea-to-issue-state-history-textbooks-rejecting-private-publishers.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-10-12|access-date = 2015-11-24|issn = 0362-4331|first = Choe|last = Sang-hun}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the left, also described as liberals and progressives, represented among others by ''[[The Hankyoreh]]'' newspaper, are critical of the changes such as removing any mentions of the [[Geochang massacre]] and excluding photos of the first [[Inter-Korean summit|North–South summit]], which they have described as biased towards a conservative view of history and the state that lends legitimacy to the pre-democratic, authoritarian, conservative governments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In particular, the regime of Park Chung-hee, the father of the current Korean president, [[Park Geun-hye]], is seen by liberals as given a "white-wash" treatment by the new revisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = South Korea set to rewrite history books|url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/b073fa02-70af-11e5-9b9e-690fdae72044.html#axzz3pfVjfFrq|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 2015-10-12|access-date = 2015-11-24|issn = 0307-1766|first = Simon|last = Mundy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservatives rebuke that the current textbooks describe Park Chung-hee and his predecessor, [[Rhee Syng-man]], in an excessively negative manner.&lt;ref name=ko2/&gt; Other controversial topics involve the framing of the pro-democratic protests against Park's regime,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; or the inclusion of the story of Korean teenage heroine [[Yu Gwan-sun]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A high school heroine has South Koreans fighting over history textbooks|url = http://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-south-korea-textbook-battle-20151105-story.html|website = latimes.com|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberals had also criticized the action on the grounds that the government control over textbooks is limiting freedom of speech and spreading propaganda.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As of October 22, 2015, a petition against the new textbook reform had over 50,000 signatures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The government has also been facing several lawsuits, including one by the current textbook authors who accuse the government of [[Defamation|libel]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ko2&gt;{{Cite web|title = (News Focus) History textbook controversy evolves into academic, ideological conflict - The Korea Observer|url = http://www.koreaobserver.com/news-focus-history-textbook-controversy-evolves-into-academic-ideological-conflict-55659/|website = The Korea Observer|accessdate = 2015-11-27|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan has been described as controversial, and has led to public protests.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Over 400 Korean history professors have expressed their opposition to the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = South Korea fights old battles with new history textbooks|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c48c9082-7bd4-11e5-a1fe-567b37f80b64.html#axzz3sOXQ9CeC|newspaper = Financial Times|access-date = 2015-11-24|issn = 0307-1766|first = Simon|last = Mundy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Korea, the proposal has been criticized by over 200 professors of [[Korean studies]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; An opinion poll showed the Korean public opinion divided into approximately 50% against the new textbook plan, and 36% in favor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Several commentators compared this to the [[comfort women]] issue, noting that with the recent government interference into the content of history books, South Korea is losing its moral high ground from which it previously criticized the Japanese government for [[Japanese history textbook controversies|its perceived historical textbook problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = South Korea fights old battles with new history textbooks|url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c48c9082-7bd4-11e5-a1fe-567b37f80b64.html|newspaper = Financial Times|access-date = 2015-11-27|issn = 0307-1766|first = Simon|last = Mundy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = [Reporter's column] S.

'''''L'Enseigne de Gersaint''''', or '''''The Shop Sign of Gersaint''''', (1720–21)&lt;ref&gt;Craske, Matthew. (1997) ''Art in Europe 1700–1830: A History of the Visual Arts in an Era of Unprecedented Urban Economic Growth''. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], p. 175. {{ISBN|0192842064}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a painting by [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]], which is considered to be his last masterpiece. It was painted as a shop sign for the ''[[marchand-mercier]]'', or art dealer, [[Edme François Gersaint]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Germain Bazin|Bazin, Germain]]. (1964) ''Baroque &amp; Rococo''. Translated by Jonathan Griffin. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 197. {{ISBN|0500200181}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Daniel Roche (historian)|Daniel Roche]] the sign functioned more as an advertisement for the artist than the dealer.&lt;ref&gt;Of the ''enseigne'', "Elle ne fait pas publicité de Gersaint, mais celle de Watteau", [[Daniel Roche (historian)|Daniel Roche]] observes in his preface to Guillaume Glorieux's monograph, ''À l'Enseigne de Gersaint: Edme-François Gersaint, marchand d'art sur le Pont Notre-Dame'', Paris, 2002; of Gersaint, Glorieux remarks at the outset, "immortalisé par le chef-d'oeuvre de Watteau, Gersaint est célèbre mais on ne sait presque rien de lui."&lt;/ref&gt; 

The painting exaggerates the size of Gersaint's cramped [[boutique]], hardly more than a permanent booth with a little [[backshop]], on the medieval [[Pont Notre-Dame]], in the heart of Paris, both creating and following fashion as he purveyed works of art and luxurious trifles to an aristocratic clientele.&lt;ref&gt;"Gersaint, faiseur de modes, suiveur de modes, est, d'une autre façon que Watteau, un créateur vrai", remarks Daniel Roche in his preface to Glorieux 2002:v.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
[[File:Gersaint-detail.jpg|thumb|The central couple watch the boxing up of Louis XIV]]
The picture was originally painted on one canvas, depicting clients and staff at the shop. As a worker packs away a portrait of [[Louis XIV]] at the left, in the centre a young man offers his hand to a woman who is stepping over the threshold of the shop. At the right an elderly couple examine a painting of nudes, and a pretty young shop assistant, possibly Gersaint's wife, shows a painting to a group of well-dressed young people. In its present form, the painting consists of two separate parts, the upper sections of them were added between 1720 and 1732 by an unknown painter to transform the painting from its original, arched shape into a rectangular field. Watteau probably painted the work in the spring of 1720 when the entire entrance facade of Gersaint's shop was rebuilt. According to the study by Vogtherr and Wenders de Calisse (2007) the painting had originally covered the round field above the entrance of the shop. These changes to the building were made in the spring of 1720, the most likely date for the painting.

The artworks in the painting are set alongside the actions of high-society criticism. The young man offering his hand to the woman in pink is set against a series of female nudes, while puritanical figures in portraits at the left seem to look down disapprovingly. At the right, there are numerous images of orgies and naked figures, implying that art expresses the hidden lustful feelings of the genteel figures in the shop, who merely gaze at one another or engage in polite gestures of intimacy.

Commonly, the painting is interpreted as a commentary on the shift in aristocratic culture – or relief – that occurred during the government of the more licentious ''Régent'' [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] (1715–1723), after the death of [[Louis XIV]] and before the accession to the throne of [[Louis XV]]. The boxing of [[Pierre Mignard]]'s portrait of the deceased king implies the end of the old régime.

==Provenance==
The painting never actually functioned as an external shop sign, spending only fifteen days at the shop. Watteau himself asked Gersaint to allow him to paint it, complaining of "cold fingers" that needed some exercise.&lt;ref name = "tcw"&gt;T. C. W. Blanning, ''The Culture of Power and the Power of Culture: Old Regime Europe 1660–1789'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; It was soon bought by Claude Glucq. It was then acquired by Watteau's patron Jean de Jullienne.&lt;ref name = "tcw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watteau, 1684–1721'', National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1984, p.450&lt;/ref&gt; An [[engraving]] was made in 1732 after a small version by Pater who extended Watteau's composition for the print. It attracted the attention of [[Frederick the Great]] of [[Prussia]]. He bought the painting in 1748 (at that time already in two separate parts) from the Dutch dealer Pieter Boetgens. It remained in Germany thereafter, now forming part of the collection of the Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg that display it at the [[Charlottenburg Palace]], [[Berlin]] where it had first been displayed in 1748.

'''Magical realism''', '''magic realism''', or '''marvelous realism''' is a [[genre]] of [[narrative]] [[fiction]] and, more broadly, [[art]] (literature, painting, film, theatre, etc.) that, while encompassing a range of subtly different concepts, expresses a primarily realistic view of the real world while also adding or revealing magical elements. It is sometimes called '''fabulism''', in reference to the conventions of [[fable]]s, [[myth]]s, and [[allegory]]. "Magical realism", perhaps the most common term, often refers to fiction and literature in particular,&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;{{rp|1–5}} with [[magic in fiction|magic]] or the [[supernatural]] presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane [[setting (narrative)|setting]].

The terms are broadly descriptive rather than critically rigorous. Matthew Strecher defines magic realism as "what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew C. Strecher, Magical Realism and the Search for Identity in the Fiction of Murakami Haruki, Journal of Japanese Studies, Volume 25, Number 2 (Summer 1999), pp. 263-298, at 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Many writers are categorized as "magical realists", which confuses the term and its wide definition. Irene Guenther tackles the German roots of the term, and how art is related to literature.&lt;ref name="Guenther1995" /&gt; Magical realism is often associated with [[Latin American literature]], particularly authors including genre founders [[Gabriel García Márquez]], [[Miguel Angel Asturias]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Elena Garro]], [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Rómulo Gallegos]], and [[Isabel Allende]]. In [[English literature]], its chief exponents include [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Alice Hoffman]], and [[Nick Joaquin]].

Magic realism was also called '''faux surrealism''' by artist and photographer Frank Van Imschoot. Whenever a piece of art looks surreal, but it's actually a reflection of the reality without any [[mise-en-scène]].

==Etymology==
While the term ''magical realism'' first appeared in English in 1955,&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;{{rp|16}} the term ''Magischer Realismus,'' translated as ''magic realism,'' was first used by German art critic [[Franz Roh]] in 1925&lt;ref&gt;Slemon, Stephen. [https://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/sslemon/slemon/canlit116-Magic(Slemon)%20(1).pdf''Magic realism as post-colonial discourse''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425234831/https://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/sslemon/slemon/canlit116-Magic(Slemon)%20(1).pdf |date=2018-04-25 }}. In: Canadian Literature #116 (Spring 1988),pp. 9-24, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to a painterly style also known as [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] (the [[New Objectivity]]),&lt;ref&gt;Franz Roh: Nach-Expressionismus. Magischer Realismus. Probleme der neuesten europäischen Malerei.

However, in contrast with its use in literature, magic realist art does not often include overtly fantastic or magical content, but rather looks at the mundane through a hyper-realistic and often mysterious lens.&lt;ref name="Guenther1995" /&gt;

German magic realist paintings influenced the Italian writer [[Massimo Bontempelli]], who has been called the first to apply magic realism to writing, aiming to capture the fantastic, mysterious nature of reality. In 1926 he founded the magic realist magazine ''900.Novecento,'' and his writings influenced Belgian magic realist writers [[Johan Daisne]] and [[Hubert Lampo]].&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;{{rp|13–14}}

Roh's magic realism also influenced writers in Hispanic America, where it was translated as ''realismo mágico'' in 1927. Venezuelan writer [[Arturo Uslar-Pietri]], who had known Bontempelli, wrote influential magic realist short stories in the 1930s and 40s that focused on the mystery and reality of how we live.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} Luis Leal attests that Pietri seemed to have been the first to adopt the term ''realismo mágico'' in Hispanic America in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Leal, Luis, "Magical Realism in Spanish America" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that Mexican writer Elena Garro used the same term to describe the works of [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] but dismissed her own work as a part of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Rosas Lopátegui, Patricia. ''El asesinato de Elena Garro'', Porrúa, México. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; French-Russian Cuban writer [[Alejo Carpentier]], who rejected Roh's magic realism as tiresome pretension, developed his related concept ''lo real maravilloso,'' or ''marvelous realism,'' in 1949.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;{{rp|14}} Maggie Ann Bowers writes that marvelous realist literature and art expresses "the seemingly opposed perspectives of a pragmatic, practical and tangible approach to reality and an acceptance of magic and superstition" within an environment of differing cultures.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;{{rp|2–3}}

The term ''magical realism,'' as opposed to ''magic realism,'' first emerged in the 1955 essay "Magical Realism in Spanish American Fiction" by critic Angel Flores in reference to writing that combines aspects of magic realism and marvelous realism. While Flores named [[Jorge Luis Borges]] as the first magical realist, he failed to acknowledge either Carpentier or Pietri for bringing Roh's magic realism to Latin America. Borges is often seen as a predecessor of magical realists, with only Flores considering him a true magical realist.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;{{rp|16–18}}

After Flores's essay, there was a resurgence of interest in marvelous realism, which, after the Cuban revolution of 1959, led to the term ''magical realism'' being applied to a new type of literature known for matter-of-fact portrayal of magical events.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

==Literature==

===Characteristics===
The extent to which the characteristics below apply to a given magic realist text varies. Every text is different and employs a smattering of the qualities listed here. However, they accurately portray what one might expect from a magic realist text.

====Fantastical elements====
Magical realism portrays fantastical events in an otherwise realistic tone. It brings fables, folk tales, and myths into contemporary social relevance. Fantasy traits given to characters, such as levitation, telepathy, and telekinesis, help to encompass modern political realities that can be phantasmagorical.&lt;ref&gt;The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms, 3rd ed., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Real-world setting====
The existence of fantasy elements in the real world provides the basis for magical realism. Writers do not invent new worlds but reveal the magical in this world, as was done by [[Gabriel García Márquez]] who wrote the seminal work of the style, ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''.&lt;ref name=Leal89&gt;García, ''Leal'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In the world of magical realism, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world.&lt;ref name=Zlotchew15&gt;Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism.'' New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007. p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

====Authorial reticence====
Authorial reticence is the "deliberate withholding of information and explanations about the disconcerting fictitious world".&lt;ref&gt;Chanady, Amaryll Beatrice. Magical Realism and the Fantastic: Resolved versus Unresolved Antinomy. New York: Garland Publishing Inc., 1985. pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator is indifferent, a characteristic enhanced by this absence of explanation of fantastic events; the story proceeds with "logical precision" as if nothing extraordinary had taken place.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flores |first1=Angel |title=Magical Realism in Spanish American Fiction |journal=Hispania |date=May 1955 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=187 |doi=10.2307/335812 |jstor=335812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chanady, Amaryll Beatrice. Magical Realism and the Fantastic: Resolved versus Unresolved Antinomy. New York: Garland Publishing Inc., 1995. pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Magical events are presented as ordinary occurrences; therefore, the reader accepts the marvelous as normal and common.&lt;ref name=Bowers25-27&gt;Bowers, Maggie A. ''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 25-27. New York: Routledge, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining the supernatural world or presenting it as extraordinary would immediately reduce its legitimacy relative to the natural world. The reader would consequently disregard the supernatural as false testimony.

====Plenitude====
In his essay "The Baroque and the Marvelous Real", [[Cubans|Cuban]] writer [[Alejo Carpentier]] defined the [[baroque]] by a lack of emptiness, a departure from structure or rules, and an "extraordinary" abundance (plenitude) of disorienting detail (citing [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] as its opposite). From this angle, Carpentier views the baroque as a layering of elements, which translates easily into the post-colonial or transcultural Latin American atmosphere that he emphasizes in ''[[The Kingdom of this World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo, ''El Reino de este Mundo''&lt;/ref&gt; "America, a continent of symbiosis, mutations... [[mestizaje]], engenders the baroque",&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo, "The baroque and the marvelous real" from ''MR: Theory History, Community''&lt;/ref&gt; made explicit by elaborate Aztec temples and associative Nahuatl poetry. These mixing ethnicities grow together with the American baroque; the space in between is where the "marvelous real" is seen. Marvelous: not meaning beautiful and pleasant, but extraordinary, strange, and excellent. Such a complex system of layering—encompassed in the Latin American "boom" novel, such as ''One Hundred Years of Solitude''—aims towards "translating the scope of America".&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo, "The baroque and the marvelous real" from ''Magical Realism: Theory, History, Community'', pp.107&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hybridity====
Magical realism plot lines characteristically employ hybrid multiple planes of reality that take place in "inharmonious arenas of such opposites as urban and rural, and Western and indigenous".&lt;ref name="Post Colonial Studies at Emory"&gt;{{cite web

====Metafiction====
{{main|Metafiction}}

This trait centers on the reader's role in literature. With its multiple realities and specific reference to the reader's world, it explores the impact fiction has on reality, reality on fiction and the reader's role in between; as such, it is well suited for drawing attention to social or political criticism. Furthermore, it is the tool paramount in the execution of a related and major magic realist phenomenon: textualization. This term defines two conditions&amp;mdash;first, where a fictitious reader enters the [[story within a story]] while reading it, making them self-conscious of their status as readers&amp;mdash;and secondly, where the textual world enters into the reader's (real) world. Good sense would negate this process but "magic" is the flexible convention that allows it.&lt;ref&gt;Thiem, Jon, "The Textualization of the Reader in Magical Realist Fiction" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heightened awareness of mystery====
Something that most critics agree on is this major theme. Magic realist literature tends to read at an intensified level. Taking ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'', the reader must let go of preexisting ties to conventional [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], plot advancement, linear time structure, scientific reason, etc., to strive for a state of heightened awareness of life's connectedness or hidden meanings. Luis Leal articulates this feeling as "to seize the mystery that breathes behind things",&lt;ref&gt;Leal, Luis, "Magical Realism in Spanish American Literature," from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''&lt;/ref&gt; and supports the claim by saying a writer must heighten his senses to the point of "estado limite" (translated as "limit state" or "extreme") in order to realize all levels of reality, most importantly that of mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo, "On the Marvelous Real in America", the Introduction to his novel, ''The Kingdom of this World''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Political critique====
Magic realism contains an "implicit criticism of society, particularly the elite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially with regard to Latin America, the style breaks from the inarguable discourse of "privileged centers of literature".&lt;ref&gt;D'haen, Theo, "Magical realism and postmodernism: decentering privileged centers" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''&lt;/ref&gt; This is a mode primarily about and for "ex-centrics": the geographically, socially and economically marginalized. Therefore, magic realism's "alternative world" works to correct the reality of established viewpoints (like realism, naturalism, modernism). Magic realist texts, under this logic, are subversive texts, revolutionary against socially dominant forces. Alternatively, the socially dominant may implement magical realism to disassociate themselves from their "[[discourse|power discourse]]".&lt;ref&gt;D'haen, Theo, "Magical realism and postmodernism: decentering privileged centers" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Theo D'haen calls this change in perspective "decentering".

In his review of Gabriel Garcia Márquez' novel ''[[Chronicle of a Death Foretold]]'', [[Salman Rushdie]] argues that the formal experiment of magic realism allows political ideas to be expressed in ways which might not be possible through more established literary forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juul|first1=Jesper|title=Are Game Experiments Apolitical? Avant-garde and Magic Realism|url=https://www.jesperjuul.net/ludologist/2014/08/13/are-game-experiments-apolitical/|website=The Ludologist|accessdate=4 July 2017|date=13 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425234831/https://www.jesperjuul.net/ludologist/2014/08/13/are-game-experiments-apolitical/|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"El realismo magical", magic realism, at least as practised by Márquez, is a development out of Surrealism that expresses a genuinely "Third World" consciousness. It deals with what Naipaul has called "half-made" societies, in which the impossibly old struggles against the appallingly new, in which public corruptions and private anguishes are somehow more garish and extreme than they ever get in the so-called "North", where centuries of wealth and power have formed thick layers over the surface of what's really going on. In the works of Márquez, as in the world he describes, impossible things happen constantly, and quite plausibly, out in the open under the midday sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rushdie|first1=Salman|title=Imaginary Homelands: Essays and Criticism 1981-1991|date=1991|publisher=Granta Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-670-83952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Origins===
Literary magic realism originated in Latin America. Writers often traveled between their home country and European cultural hubs, such as Paris or Berlin, and were influenced by the art movement of the time.&lt;ref name="Faris, Wendy B pp. 3-4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carpentier, Alejo: "The Baroque and the Marvelous Real (1975)" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban writer [[Alejo Carpentier]] and Venezuelan [[Arturo Uslar-Pietri]], for example, were strongly influenced by European artistic movements, such as [[Surrealism]], during their stays in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt; One major event that linked painterly and literary magic realisms was the translation and publication of Franz Roh's book into Spanish by Spain's ''Revista de Occidente'' in 1927, headed by major literary figure [[José Ortega y Gasset]]. "Within a year, Magic Realism was being applied to the prose of European authors in the literary circles of Buenos Aires."&lt;ref name="Guenther1995" /&gt;{{rp|61}} [[Jorge Luis Borges]] inspired and encouraged other Latin American writers in the development of magical realism – particularly with his first magical realist publication, ''[[Historia universal de la infamia]]'' in 1935.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Between 1940 and 1950, magical realism in Latin America reached its peak, with prominent writers appearing mainly in Argentina.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

The theoretical implications of visual art's magic realism greatly influenced European and Latin American literature. Italian [[Massimo Bontempelli]], for instance, claimed that [[literature]] could be a means to create a collective consciousness by "opening new mythical and magical perspectives on reality", and used his writings to inspire an Italian nation governed by [[Fascism]].&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt; Pietri was closely associated with Roh's form of magic realism and knew Bontempelli in Paris. Rather than follow Carpentier's developing versions of "the (Latin) American marvelous real", Uslar-Pietri's writings emphasize "the mystery of human living amongst the reality of life". He believed magic realism was "a continuation of the '''vanguardia''' [or [[avant-garde]]] modernist experimental writings of Latin America".&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;

===Major topics in criticism===

====Ambiguities in definition====
Mexican critic Luis Leal summed up the difficulty of defining magical realism by writing, "If you can explain it, then it's not magical realism."&lt;ref&gt;García, ''Leal'', p. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; He offers his own definition by writing, "Without thinking of the concept of magical realism, each writer gives expression to a reality he observes in the people. To me, magical realism is an attitude on the part of the characters in the novel toward the world," or toward nature.

Leal and Guenther both quote [[Arturo Uslar-Pietri]], who described "man as a mystery surrounded by realistic facts. A poetic prediction or a poetic denial of reality. What for lack of another name could be called a magical realism."&lt;ref&gt;Pietri, Arturo Uslar, ''Letras y hombres de Venezuela''. Mexico City, Fondo de Cultura Economica: 1949. pp. 161-61&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that Pietri, in presenting his term for this literary tendency, always kept its definition open by means of a language more lyrical and evocative than strictly critical, as in this 1948 statement. When academic critics attempted to define magical realism with scholarly exactitude, they discovered that it was more powerful than precise. Critics, frustrated by their inability to pin down the term's meaning, have urged its complete abandonment. Yet in Pietri's vague, ample usage, magical realism was wildly successful in summarizing for many readers their perception of much Latin American fiction; this fact suggests that the term has its uses, so long as it is not expected to function with the precision expected of technical, scholarly terminology.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

====Western and native worldviews====
The critical perspective towards magical realism as a conflict between reality and abnormality stems from the Western reader's disassociation with [[mythology]], a root of magical realism more easily understood by non-Western cultures.&lt;ref name="Faris, Wendy B pp. 3-4"&gt;Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson Zamora, Introduction to ''Magical Realism: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; Western confusion regarding magical realism is due to the "conception of the real" created in a magical realist text: rather than explain reality using natural or physical laws, as in typical Western texts, magical realist texts create a reality "in which the relation between incidents, characters, and setting could not be based upon or justified by their status within the physical world or their normal acceptance by bourgeois mentality".&lt;ref&gt;Angel Flores, qtd. in {{citation|last= Simpkins |first= Scott |title= Magical Strategies: The Supplement of Realism |journal = Twentieth Century Literature |volume= 34 |number= 2 |year= 1988 |pages= 140–154 |jstor= 441074 |doi=10.2307/441074}}, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Guatemalan author [[William Spindler]]'s article, "Magic realism: a typology",&lt;ref&gt;Spindler, W. "Magic realism: a typology", Forum for Modern Language Studies. (1993) Vol. xxxix No. 1&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that there are three kinds of magic realism, which however are by no means incompatible: European "metaphysical" magic realism, with its sense of estrangement and the uncanny, exemplified by [[Kafka]]'s fiction; "ontological" magical realism, characterized by "matter-of-factness" in relating "inexplicable" events; and "anthropological" magical realism, where a Native worldview is set side by side with the Western rational worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/225960/3/French,%20M.,%20Jackson,%20S.%20Jokisuu,%20E.%20(2010)%20'Diverse%20Engagement%20-%20Drawing%20in%20the%20Margins'%20online%20edition-3.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119235615/http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/1810/225960/3/French,%20M.,%20Jackson,%20S.%20Jokisuu,%20E.%20(2010)%20'Diverse%20Engagement%20-%20Drawing%20in%20the%20Margins'%20online%20edition-3.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spindler's typology of magic realism has been criticized as "an act of categorization which seeks to define Magic Realism as a culturally specific project, by identifying for his readers those (non-modern) societies where myth and magic persist and where Magic Realism might be expected to occur. There are objections to this analysis. Western rationalism models may not actually describe Western modes of thinking and it is possible to conceive of instances where both orders of knowledge are simultaneously possible."&lt;ref&gt;Liam Connell , "Discarding Magic Realism: Modernism, Anthropology, and Critical Practice", in ARIEL, Vol. 29, No. 2, April, 1998, pp. 95-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lo real maravilloso====
[[Alejo Carpentier]] originated the term ''lo real maravilloso'' (roughly "the marvelous real") in the prologue to his novel ''[[The Kingdom of this World]]'' (1949); however, some debate whether he is truly a magical realist writer, or simply a precursor and source of inspiration. Maggie Bowers claims he is widely acknowledged as the originator of Latin American magical realism (as both a novelist and critic);&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt; she describes Carpentier's conception as a kind of heightened reality where elements of the miraculous can appear while seeming natural and unforced. She suggests that by disassociating himself and his writings from Roh's painterly magic realism, Carpentier aimed to show how&amp;mdash;by virtue of Latin America's varied history, geography, demography, politics, myths, and beliefs&amp;mdash;improbable and marvelous things are made possible.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt; Furthermore, Carpentier's meaning is that Latin America is a land filled with marvels, and that "writing about this land automatically produces a literature of marvelous reality".&lt;ref&gt;Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism.'' New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alejocarpentier.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Alejo Carpentier]]

"The marvelous" may be easily confused with magical realism, as both modes introduce supernatural events without surprising the implied author. In both, these magical events are expected and accepted as everyday occurrences. However, the marvelous world is a unidimensional world. The implied author believes that anything can happen here, as the entire world is filled with supernatural beings and situations to begin with. Fairy tales are a good example of marvelous literature. The important idea in defining the marvelous is that readers understand that this fictional world is different from the world where they live. The "marvelous" one-dimensional world differs from the ''bidimensional'' world of magical realism, as in the latter, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world (arriving at the combination of ''two'' layers of reality: bidimensional).&lt;ref name=Zlotchew15 /&gt; While some use the terms magical realism and lo real maravilloso interchangeably, the key difference lies in the focus.&lt;ref&gt;Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism''. New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Luis Leal (writer)|Luis Leal]] attests that Carpentier was an originating pillar of the magical realist style by implicitly referring to the latter's critical works, writing that "The existence of the marvelous real is what started magical realist literature, which some critics claim is ''the'' truly American literature".&lt;ref&gt;Leal, Luis, "Magical Realism in Spanish America" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 122&lt;/ref&gt; It can consequently be drawn that Carpentier's "lo real maravilloso" is especially distinct from ''magical realism'' by the fact that the former applies specifically to ''America''.&lt;ref name="Daniel, Lee A 1982"/&gt; On that note, Lee A. Daniel categorizes critics of Carpentier into three groups: those that do not consider him a magical realist whatsoever (Ángel Flores), those that call him "a mágicorealista writer with no mention of his "lo real maravilloso" (Gómez Gil, Jean Franco, Carlos Fuentes)", and those that use the two terms interchangeably (Fernando Alegria, Luis Leal, Emir Rodriguez Monegal).&lt;ref name="Daniel, Lee A 1982"/&gt;

====Latin American exclusivity====
Criticism that Latin America is the birthplace and cornerstone of all things magic realist is quite common. Ángel Flores does not deny that magical realism is an international commodity but articulates that it has a Hispanic birthplace, writing that "Magical realism is a continuation of the romantic realist tradition of Spanish language literature and its European counterparts."&lt;ref&gt;Flores, Angel, "Magical Realism in Spanish America" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Flores is not alone on this front; there is argument between those who see magical realism as a Latin American invention and those who see it as the global product of a [[postmodern]] world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson Zamora, Introduction to ''MR: Theory, History, Community''&lt;/ref&gt; Guenther concludes, "Conjecture aside, it is in Latin America that [magic realism] was primarily seized by literary criticism and was, through translation and literary appropriation, transformed."&lt;ref name="Guenther1995" /&gt;{{rp|61}} Magic realism has taken on an internationalization: dozens of non-Hispanic writers are categorized as such, and many believe that it truly ''is'' an international commodity.&lt;ref&gt;Faris, Wendy B. and Lois Parkinson Zamora, Introduction to MR: Theory, History, Community, pp. 4 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hispanic Origin Theory: If considering all citations given in this article, there are issues with Guenther's and other critic's "Hispanic origin theory" and conclusion. By admission of this article, the term "magical realism" first came into artistic usage in 1927 by German critic Franz Roh after the 1915 publication of Franz Kafka's novella "[[The Metamorphosis]]", both visual and literary representations and uses of magic realism, regardless of suffix nitpicking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Russian author, Nikolai Gogol and his story "The Nose" (1835), is also a predecessor to the Hispanic origin theory. All this further called into question by Borges' critical standing as a true magical realist versus a predecessor to magic realism and how the dates of publications between Hispanic and European works compare.  Magic realism has certainly enjoyed a "golden era" in the Hispanic communities. It cannot be denied that Hispanic communities, Argentina in particular, have supported great movements and talents in magic realism. One could validly suggest that the height of magic realism has been seen in Latin American countries, though, feminist readers might disagree. Virginia Woolf, Angela Carter, Toni Morrison and Charlotte Perkins Gilman being excellent critical challenges to this notion of Hispanic magic realism as a full and diversely aware aesthetic. Allende being a later contribution to this gender aware discourse. Frida Kahlo, of course, being important to this as well but also at a later date than Woolf and Gilman. This feminist mapping, however, is unnecessary in identifying a basic truth. Kafka and Gogol predate Borges. They may each have their own forms of magic realism, but they are each by the broader definition solidly within this article's given identification: "a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe...."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

This issue of feminist study in magic realism and its origination is an important discourse, as well. It should not be ignored. Given that magic realism, by nature of its craft, allows underrepresented and minority voices to be heard in more subtle and representational contexts, magic realism may be one of the better forms available to authors and artists who are expressing unpopular scenarios in socio-political contexts. Again, Woolf, Allende, Kahlo, Carter, Morrison and Gilman being excellent examples of diversity in gender and ethnicity in magic realism. To this end, Hispanic origin theory does not hold.

Gender diversity aside, magic realism's foundational beginnings are much more diverse and intricate than what the Hispanic origin theory would suggest as defined in this article. Early in the article, we read a broader definition:  "[magic realism is] what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe..." This "too strange to believe" standard being relative to European aesthetics—i.e. Woolf's, Kafka's and Gogol's work. Later, we read another definition and seeming precedent to the Hispanic origin theory: "Magical realism is a continuation of the romantic realist tradition of Spanish language literature." This "continuation" is a subset of a broader magic realism definition and standard. The Hispanic "continuation" and "romantic realist tradition of Spanish language" subset certainly identifies why magic realism took root and further developed in Hispanic communities, but it does not set a precedent for ground zero origination or ownership purely in Hispanic cultures. Magic realism originated in Germany as much as it did in Latin American countries. Both can claim their more specific aesthetics, but to identify the broader term of magic realism as being Hispanic is merely a theory unsupported by the citations within this article. Perhaps it is time to identify each as its own as part of a broader and less biased umbrella.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Magic realism is a continued craft in the many countries that have contributed to it in its earliest stages. Germany being first and Latin American countries being a close second. There are certainly differences in aesthetics between European and Hispanic magic realists, but they are both equally magic realists. For this reason, the Hispanic magic realists should really have proper designation as such but not the overarching umbrella of the broader term as this article suggests.&lt;ref name="Guenther1995" /&gt;

====Postmodernism====
Taking into account that, theoretically, magical realism was born in the 20th century, some have argued that connecting it to postmodernism is a logical next step. To further connect the two concepts, there are descriptive commonalities between the two that Belgian critic Theo D'haen addresses in his essay, "Magical Realism and Postmodernism". While authors such as [[Günter Grass]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], [[Peter Handke]], [[Italo Calvino]], [[John Fowles]], [[Angela Carter]], [[John Banville]], [[Michel Tournier]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Willem Brakman]] and [[Louis Ferron]] might be widely considered postmodernist, they can "just as easily be categorized ... magic realist".&lt;ref&gt;D'haen, Theo L., "Magical realism and postmodernism" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 193&lt;/ref&gt; A list has been compiled of characteristics one might typically attribute to postmodernism, but which also could describe literary magic realism: "self-reflexiveness, metafiction, eclecticism, redundancy, multiplicity, discontinuity, intertextuality, parody, the dissolution of character and narrative instance, the erasure of boundaries, and the destabilization of the reader".&lt;ref&gt;D'haen, Theo L., "Magical realism and postmodernism" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 192-3 [D'haen references many texts that attest to these qualities]&lt;/ref&gt; To further connect the two, magical realism and postmodernism share the themes of post-colonial discourse, in which jumps in time and focus cannot really be explained with scientific but rather with magical reasoning; textualization (of the reader); and metafiction.

Concerning attitude toward audience, the two have, some argue, a lot in common. Magical realist works do not seek to primarily satisfy a popular audience, but instead, a sophisticated audience that must be attuned to noticing textual "subtleties".&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; While the postmodern writer condemns escapist literature (like fantasy, crime, ghost fiction), he/she is inextricably related to it concerning readership. There are two modes in [[postmodern literature]]: one, commercially successful pop fiction, and the other, philosophy, better suited to intellectuals. A singular reading of the first mode will render a distorted or reductive understanding of the text. The fictitious reader&amp;mdash;such as Aureliano from ''100 Years of Solitude''&amp;mdash;is the hostage used to express the writer's anxiety on this issue of who is reading the work and to what ends, and of how the writer is forever reliant upon the needs and desires of readers (the market).&lt;ref&gt;Thiem, Jon, "The textualization of the reader in magical realist fiction" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community''&lt;/ref&gt; The magic realist writer with difficulty must reach a balance between saleability and intellectual integrity. Wendy Faris, talking about magic realism as a contemporary phenomenon that leaves modernism for postmodernism, says, "Magic realist fictions do seem more youthful and popular than their modernist predecessors, in that they often (though not always) cater with unidirectional story lines to our basic desire to hear what happens next. Thus they may be more clearly designed for the entertainment of readers."&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Faris, "Scheherezade's Children: Magical Realism and Postmodern Fiction," from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with related genres===
When attempting to define what something ''is'', it is often helpful to define what something is ''not''. It is also important to note that many literary critics attempt to classify novels and literary works in only one genre, such as "romantic" or "naturalist", not always taking into account that many works fall into multiple categories.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Much discussion is cited from Maggie Ann Bowers' book ''Magic(al) Realism'', wherein she attempts to delimit the terms magic realism and magical realism by examining the relationships with other genres such as realism, surrealism, fantastic literature, science fiction and its African version, the Animist Realism.

====Realism====
[[Literary realism|Realism]] is an attempt to create a depiction of actual life; a novel does not simply rely on what it presents but ''how'' it presents it. In this way, a realist narrative acts as framework by which the reader constructs a world using the raw materials of life. Understanding both realism and magical realism within the realm of a narrative mode is key to understanding both terms. Magical realism "relies upon the presentation of real, imagined or magical elements as if they were real. It relies upon realism, but only so that it can stretch what is acceptable as real to its limits".&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Maggie A. ''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 22. New York: Routledge, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a simple point of comparison, Roh's differentiation between expressionism and post-expressionism as described in ''German Art in the 20th Century,'' may be applied to magic realism and realism. [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] pertains to the terms "history", "mimetic", "familiarization", "empiricism/logic", "narration", "closure-ridden/reductive naturalism", and "rationalization/cause and effect".&lt;ref name="Simpkins, Scott 1988"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simpkins |first1=Scott |title=Magical Strategies: The Supplement of Realism |journal=Twentieth Century Literature |date=1988 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=140–154 |doi=10.2307/441074 |jstor=441074}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, magic realism encompasses the terms "myth/legend", "fantastic/supplementation", "defamiliarization", "mysticism/magic", "meta-narration", "open-ended/expansive romanticism", and "imagination/negative capability".&lt;ref name="Simpkins, Scott 1988"/&gt;

====Surrealism====
[[Surrealism]] is often confused with magical realism as they both explore illogical or non-realist aspects of humanity and existence. There is a strong historical connection between Franz Roh's concept of magic realism and surrealism, as well as the resulting influence on Carpentier's marvelous reality; however, important differences remain. Surrealism "is most distanced from magical realism [in that] the aspects that it explores are associated not with material reality but with the imagination and the mind, and in particular it attempts to express the 'inner life' and psychology of humans through art". It seeks to express the sub-conscious, unconscious, the repressed and inexpressible. Magical realism, on the other hand, rarely presents the extraordinary in the form of a dream or a ''psychological experience''. "To do so," Bowers writes, "takes the magic of recognizable material reality and places it into the little understood world of the imagination. The ordinariness of magical realism's magic relies on its accepted and unquestioned position in tangible and ''material reality''."&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Maggie A. ''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 22-24. New York: Routledge, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Imaginary realism====
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
"Imaginary realism" is a term first coined by Dutch painter [[Carel Willink]] as a pendant of magic realism. Where magic realism uses fantastical and unreal elements, imaginary realism strictly uses realistic elements in an imagined scene. As such, the classic painters with their biblical and mythological scenes, can be qualified as 'imaginary realists'. With the increasing availability of photo editing software, also art photographers like [[Karl Hammer]] and others create artistic works in this genre.

====Fabulism====
Fabulism traditionally refers to fables, parables, and myths, and is sometimes used in contemporary contexts for authors whose work falls within or relates to Magical Realism. [[Italo Calvino]] is an example of a writer in the genre who uses the term ''fabulist''.

Though often used to refer to works of magical realism, fabulism incorporates fantasy elements into reality, using myths and fables to critique the exterior world and offer direct allegorical interpretations. Austrian-American child psychologist [[Bruno_Bettelheim|Bruno Bettelheim]] suggested that fairy tales have psychological merit. They are used to translate trauma into a context that people can more easily understand and help to process difficult truths. Bettelheim posited that the darkness and morality of traditional fairy tales allowed children to grapple with questions of fear through symbolism. Fabulism helped to work through these complexities and, in the words of Bettelheim, "make physical what is otherwise ephemeral or ineffable in an attempt...of understanding those things that we struggle the most to talk about: loss, love, transition." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Haggard |first1=Kit |title=How a queer fabulism came to dominate contemporary women’s writing |url=https://theoutline.com/post/5751/fabulism-fiction-carmen-maria-machado-daisy-johnson-melissa-broder?zd=2&amp;zi=uju7vyr3 |website=theoutline.com |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Amber Sparks described fabulism as blending fantastical elements into a realistic setting. Crucial to the genre, said Sparks, is that the elements are often borrowed from specific myths, fairy tales, and folktales. Unlike magical realism, it does not just use general magical elements, but directly incorporates details from well known stories. "Our lives are bizarre, meandering, and fantastic," said Hannah Gilham of the ''[[Washington_Square_Review|Washington Square Review]]'' regarding fabulism. "Shouldn’t our fiction reflect that?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gilham |first1=Hannah |title=Discovering the Fabulists: The Value of the Bizarre in Literature |url=http://www.washingtonsquarereview.com/blog/2018/2/7/in-defense-of-the-fantastic-breaking-up-with-realism |website=Washington Square Review |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Magical Realism is traditionally used to refer to works that are Latin American in origin, fabulism is not tied to any specific culture. Rather than focusing on political realities, fabulism tends to focus on the entirety of the human experience through the mechanization of fairy tales and myths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Capettini |first1=Emily |title=A Second Ribcage: Fiction and an Article on New Wave Fabulism, Trauma, and the Environment |url=https://pqdtopen.proquest.com/doc/1548306771.html?FMT=AI |website=PQDT Open |publisher=UMI Dissertation Publishing |accessdate=2 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the works of [[C._S._Lewis|C.S. Lewis]], who was once referred to as the greatest fabulist of the 20th century. His 1956 novel ''[[Till_We_Have_Faces|Till We Have Faces]]'' has been referenced as a fabulist retelling. This re-imagining of the story of [[Cupid_and_Psyche|Cupid and Psyche]] uses an age-old myth to impart moralistic knowledge on the reader. A [[The_Washington_Post|Washington Post]] review of a Lewis biography discusses how his work creates "a fiction" in order to deliver a lesson. Says the Post of Lewis, "The fabulist...illuminates the nature of things through a tale both he and his auditors, or readers, know to be an ingenious analogical invention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirk |first1=Russell |title=The Faith of a Fabulist |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1990/04/01/the-faith-of-a-fabulist/a855894c-0126-490b-a4a0-ed6b9829978b/?utm_term=.4e512c14d8a8 |website=The Washington Post |accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fantasy====
Prominent English-language fantasy writers have said that "magic realism" is only another name for [[fantasy fiction]]. [[Gene Wolfe]] said, "magic realism is fantasy written by people who speak Spanish",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wolfe | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Wolfe |author2=Baber, Brendan | chapter = Gene Wolfe Interview | editor = Wright, Peter | title = Shadows of the New Sun: Wolfe on Writing/Writers on Wolfe | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=MkPfjCVo3g4C&amp;pg=PA132 | accessdate = 2009-01-20| isbn = 9781846310577 | year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Terry Pratchett]] said magic realism "is like a polite way of saying you write fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Amaryll Beatrice Chanady distinguishes magical realist literature from fantasy literature ("the fantastic") based on differences between three shared dimensions: the use of [[antinomy]] (the simultaneous presence of two conflicting codes), the inclusion of events that cannot be integrated into a logical framework, and the use of authorial reticence. In fantasy, the presence of the supernatural code is perceived as problematic, something that draws special attention&amp;mdash;where in magical realism, the presence of the supernatural is accepted. In fantasy, while authorial reticence creates a disturbing effect on the reader, it works to ''integrate the supernatural'' into the natural framework in magical realism. This integration is made possible in magical realism as the author presents the supernatural as being equally valid to the natural. There is no hierarchy between the two codes.&lt;ref&gt;Chanady, Amaryll Beatrice, ''Magical realism and the fantastic: Resolved versus unresolved antinomy.'' New York: Garland Publishing Inc., 1985. pp. 30-31&lt;/ref&gt; The ghost of Melquíades in Márquez's ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' or the baby ghost in Toni Morrison's ''Beloved'' who visit or haunt the inhabitants of their previous residence are both presented by the narrator as ordinary occurrences; the reader, therefore, accepts the marvelous as normal and common.&lt;ref name=Bowers25-27 /&gt;

To Clark Zlotchew, the differentiating factor between the fantastic and magical realism is that in fantastic literature, such as Kafka's ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', there is a hesitation experienced by the protagonist, implied author or reader in deciding whether to attribute natural or supernatural causes to an unsettling event, or between rational or irrational explanations.&lt;ref&gt;Zlotchew, Dr. Clark. ''Varieties of Magical Realism.'' New Jersey: Academic Press ENE, 2007. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Fantastic literature has also been defined as a piece of narrative in which there is a constant faltering between belief and non-belief in the supernatural or extraordinary event.

In Leal's view, writers of fantasy literature, such as [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]], can create "new worlds, perhaps new planets. By contrast, writers like García Márquez, who use magical realism, don't create new worlds, but suggest the magical in our world."&lt;ref name=Leal89 /&gt; In magical realism, the supernatural realm blends with the natural, familiar world. This twofold world of magical realism differs from the onefold world that can be found in fairy-tale and fantasy literature.&lt;ref name=Zlotchew15 /&gt;

==== Faux surrealism ====
Artist and photographer Frank Van Imschoot first used the term "faux surrealism" in 2013 to describe the genre of some of his photographs. He was using it to tell people that his photographs were not manipulated and reflects the reality without any [[mise-en-scène]], although they were looking very [[surreal]] at the same time.

====Animist realism&lt;!--'Animist realism' redirects here--&gt;====
"Animist realism" is a term for conceptualizing the [[African literature]] that has been written based on the strong presence of the imaginary ancestor, the traditional religion and especially the [[animism]] of African cultures.

The term was used by [[Pepetela]] (1989)&lt;ref&gt;PEPETELA (1989). Lueji, o nascimento de um império. Porto, Portugal: União dos Escritores Angolanos.&lt;/ref&gt; and Harry Garuba (2003)&lt;ref&gt;GARUBA, Harry (2003).Explorations in Animist Materialism: Notes on Reading/Writing African Literature, Culture, and Society. Public Culture&lt;/ref&gt; to be a new conception of magic realism in African literature.

==== Science fiction ====
While [[science fiction]] and magical realism both bend the notion of what is real, toy with human imagination, and are forms of (often fantastical) fiction, they differ greatly. Bower's cites [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' as a novel that exemplifies the science fiction novel's requirement of a "rational, physical explanation for any unusual occurrences". Huxley portrays a world where the population is highly controlled with mood enhancing drugs, which are controlled by the government. In this world, there is no link between copulation and reproduction. Humans are produced in giant test tubes, where chemical alterations during gestation determine their fates. Bowers argues that, "The science fiction narrative's distinct difference from magical realism is that it is set in a world different from any known reality and its realism resides in the fact that we can recognize it as a possibility for our future. Unlike magical realism, it does not have a realistic setting that is recognizable in relation to any past or present reality."&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Maggie A. ''Magic(al) Realism'', pp. 29-30. New York: Routledge, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

García Márquez confessed: "My most important problem was destroying the line of demarcation that separates what seems real from what seems fantastic."&lt;ref&gt;Interview in Revista Primera Plana - Año V Buenos Aires, 20–26 June 1967 Nº 234, pages 52-55.

Her most well-known novel, ''[[The House of the Spirits]]'', is arguably similar to García Márquez's style of magical realist writing.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;{{rp|43}} Another notable novelist is [[Laura Esquivel]], whose ''[[Like Water for Chocolate]]'' tells the story of the domestic life of women living on the margins of their families and society. The novel's protagonist, Tita, is kept from happiness and marriage by her mother. "Her unrequited love and ostracism from the family lead her to harness her extraordinary powers of imbuing her emotions to the food she makes. In turn, people who eat her food enact her emotions for her. For example, after eating a wedding cake Tita made while suffering from a forbidden love, the guests all suffer from a wave of longing. The Mexican [[Juan Rulfo]] pioneered the exposition through a non-linear structure with his short novel ''[[Pedro Páramo]]'' that tells the story of Comala both as a lively town in times of the eponymous Pedro Páramo and as a ghost town through the eyes of his son Juan Preciado who returns to Comala to fulfil a promise to his dead mother.

In the English-speaking world, major authors include British Indian writer [[Salman Rushdie]], African American novelists [[Toni Morrison]] and [[Gloria Naylor]], Latinos, as [[Ana Castillo]], [[Rudolfo Anaya]], [[Daniel Olivas]], and [[Helena Maria Viramontes]], Native American authors [[Louise Erdrich]] and [[Sherman Alexie]]; English author [[Louis de Bernières]] and English feminist writer [[Angela Carter]]. Perhaps the best known is Rushdie, whose "language form of magical realism straddles both the surrealist tradition of magic realism as it developed in Europe and the mythic tradition of magical realism as it developed in Latin America".&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt; Morrison's most notable work, ''Beloved'', tells the story of a mother who, haunted by the ghost of her child, learns to cope with memories of her traumatic childhood as an abused slave and the burden of nurturing children into a harsh and brutal society.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt; [[Jonathan Safran Foer]] uses magical realism in exploring the history of the [[stetl]] and [[Holocaust]] in ''[[Everything Is Illuminated]]''.

In the Portuguese-speaking world, [[Jorge Amado]] and Nobel prize-winning novelist [[José Saramago]] are some of the most famous authors of Magic realism.

In Norway, the writers [[Erik Fosnes Hansen]], [[Jan Kjærstad]] as well as the young novelist, Rune Salvesen, have marked themselves as premier writers of magical realism, something which has been seen as very un-Norwegian.

[[Dimitris Lyacos]]'s Poena Damni trilogy, originally written in Greek, is also seen as displaying characteristics of magic realism in its simultaneous fusion of real and unreal situations in the same narrative context.

===Historical development===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[Image:George grosz-the eclipse of the sun.jpg|thumb|right|''The Eclipse of the Sun'' by [[George Grosz]], 1926]] --&gt;

[[Image:De Chirico's Love Song.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Giorgio de Chirico]], ''[[The Song of Love (Giorgio de Chirico)|Love Song]]'' 1914, [[Museum of Modern Art]]]]

The painterly style began evolving as early as the first decade of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;"Austrian Alfred Kubin spent a lifetime wrestling with the uncanny,...[and] in 1909 [he] published Die andere Seite (The Other Side), a novel illustrated with fifty-two drawings. In it, Kubin set out to explore the 'other side' of the visible world&amp;mdash;the corruption, the evil, the rot, as well as the power and mystery. The border between reality and dream remains consistently nebulous... in certain ways an important precursor [to Magic Realism],...[he] exerted significant influence on subsequent German and Austrian literature." Guenther, Irene, "Magic realism in the Weimar Republic" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; but 1925 was when ''Magischer Realismus'' and ''Neue Sachlichkeit'' were officially recognized as major trends. This was the year that Franz Roh published his book on the subject, ''Nach Expressionismus: Magischer Realismus: Probleme der neuesten europäischen Malerei'' (translated as ''After Expressionism: Magical Realism: Problems of the Newest European Painting'') and [[Gustav Hartlaub]] curated the seminal exhibition on the theme, entitled simply ''[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]'' (translated as ''[[New Objectivity]]''), at the [[Kunsthalle Mannheim]] in Mannheim, Germany.&lt;ref name="Guenther1995" /&gt;{{rp|41}} Guenther refers most frequently to the [[New Objectivity]], rather than magical realism; which is attributed to that New objectivity is practical based, referential (to real practicing artists), while the magical realism is theoretical or critic's rhetoric. Eventually under [[Massimo Bontempelli]] guidance, the term ''magic realism'' was fully embraced by the German as well as in Italian practicing communities.&lt;ref name="Guenther1995" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

[[New Objectivity]] saw an utter rejection of the preceding [[impressionist]] and [[expressionist]] movements, and Hartlaub curated his exhibition under the guideline: only those, "who have remained true or have returned to a positive, palpable reality,"&lt;ref&gt;Hartlaub, Gustav, "Werbendes Rundschreiben"&lt;/ref&gt; in order to reveal the truth of the times,"&lt;ref name="Guenther, Irene pp. 41"&gt;Guenther, Irene, "Magic realism in the Weimar Republic" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 41&lt;/ref&gt; would be included. The style was roughly divided into two subcategories: conservative, (neo-) classicist painting, and generally left-wing, politically motivated Verists.&lt;ref name="Guenther, Irene pp. 41"/&gt; The following quote by Hartlaub distinguishes the two, though mostly with reference to Germany; however, one might apply the logic to all relevant European countries. "In the new art, he saw"&lt;ref name="Guenther, Irene pp. 41"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
a right, a left wing. One, conservative towards Classicism, taking roots in timelessness, wanting to sanctify again the healthy, physically plastic in pure drawing after nature...after so much eccentricity and chaos [a reference to the repercussions of World War I]... The other, the left, glaringly contemporary, far less artistically faithful, rather born of the negation of art, seeking to expose the chaos, the true face of our time, with an addiction to primitive fact-finding and nervous baring of the self... There is nothing left but to affirm it [the new art], especially since it seems strong enough to raise new artistic willpower.&lt;ref&gt;Westheim, Paul, "Ein neuer Naturalismus?? Eine Rundfrage des Kunstblatts" in ''Das Kunstblatt'' 9 (1922)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both sides were seen all over Europe during the 1920s and 1930s, ranging from the Netherlands to Austria, France to Russia, with Germany and Italy as centers of growth.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther, Irene, "Magic realism in the Weimar Republic" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 41-45&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, [[Italians|Italian]] [[Giorgio de Chirico]], producing works in the late 1910s under the style ''arte metafisica'' (translated as ''[[Metaphysical art]]''), is seen as a precursor and as having an "influence...greater than any other painter on the artists of [[New Objectivity]]".&lt;ref&gt;Guenther, Irene, "Magic realism in the Weimar Republic" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further, see Wieland Schmied, "''Neue Sachlichkeit'' and German Realism of the Twenties" in Louise Lincoln, ed., ''German Realism of the Twenties: The Artist as Social Critic''. Minneapolis: Minneapolis Institute of Arts, 1980, pp.42&lt;/ref&gt;

Further afield, American painters were later (in the 1940s and 1950s, mostly) coined magical realists; a link between these artists and the [[Neue Sachlichkeit]] of the 1920s was explicitly made in the New York Museum of Modern Art exhibition, tellingly titled "American Realists and Magic Realists."&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy C. Miller and Alfred Barr, eds., ''American Realists and Magic Realists''. New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1943&lt;/ref&gt; French magical realist [[Pierre Roy (artist)|Pierre Roy]], who worked and showed successfully in the US, is cited as having "helped spread Franz Roh's formulations" to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Guenther, Irene, "Magic realism in the Weimar Republic" from ''MR: Theory, History, Community'', pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magic realism that excludes the overtly fantastic===
When art critic [[Franz Roh]] applied the term ''magic realism'' to visual art in 1925, he was designating a style of visual art that brings extreme [[realism (arts)|realism]] to the depiction of mundane subject matter, revealing an "interior" mystery, rather than imposing external, overtly magical features onto this everyday reality. Roh explains,

&lt;blockquote&gt;We are offered a new style that is thoroughly of this world that celebrates the mundane. This new world of objects is still alien to the current idea of Realism. It employs various techniques that endow all things with a deeper meaning and reveal mysteries that always threaten the secure tranquility of simple and ingenuous things.... it is a question of representing before our eyes, in an intuitive way, the fact, the interior figure, of the exterior world.&lt;ref name=publicasu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~aarios/resourcebank/definitions/|title=Magical Realism: Definitions|author=|date=|website=www.public.asu.edu|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925115858/http://www.public.asu.edu/~aarios/resourcebank/definitions/|archivedate=25 September 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In painting, magical realism is a term often interchanged with [[post-expressionism]], as Ríos also shows, for the very title of Roh's 1925 essay was "Magical Realism:Post-Expressionism".&lt;ref name=publicasu/&gt; Indeed, as Dr. Lois Parkinson Zamora of the [[University of Houston]] writes, "Roh, in his 1925 essay, described a group of painters whom we now categorize generally as Post-Expressionists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/~englmi/ObjectsAndSeeing_intro.html|title=Swords and Silver Rings|work=www.uh.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126210721/http://www.uh.edu/~englmi/ObjectsAndSeeing_intro.html|archivedate=2009-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alexander Kanoldt Still Life II.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Alexander Kanoldt]], ''Still Life II'' 1922]]

Roh used this term to describe painting that signaled a return to [[realism (arts)|realism]] after [[expressionism]]'s extravagances, which sought to redesign objects to reveal the spirits of those objects. Magical realism, according to Roh, instead faithfully portrays the exterior of an object, and in doing so the spirit, or magic, of the object reveals itself. One could relate this exterior magic all the way back to the 15th century. Flemish painter [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]] (1395–1441) highlights the complexity of a natural landscape by creating illusions of continuous and unseen areas that recede into the background, leaving it to the viewer's imagination to fill in those gaps in the image: for instance, in a rolling landscape with river and hills. The magic is contained in the viewer's interpretation of those mysterious unseen or hidden parts of the image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luber |first1=Katherine Crawford |title=Recognizing Van Eyck: Magical Realism in Landscape Painting |journal=Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin |date=1998 |volume=91 |issue=386/387 |pages=7–23 |doi=10.2307/3795460 |jstor=3795460}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other important aspects of magical realist painting, according to Roh, include:
* A return to ordinary subjects as opposed to fantastical ones.
* A juxtaposition of forward movement with a sense of distance, as opposed to Expressionism's tendency to foreshorten the subject.
* A use of miniature details even in expansive paintings, such as large landscapes.

The pictorial ideals of Roh's original magic realism attracted new generations of artists through the latter years of the 20th century and beyond. In a 1991 ''New York Times'' review, critic Vivien Raynor remarked that "[[John Stuart Ingle]] proves that Magic Realism lives" in his "virtuoso" [[still life]] watercolors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD91031F93AA25756C0A967958260 | work=The New York Times | title=ART; The Skill of the Watercolorist | first=Vivien | last=Raynor | date=1991-05-19 | accessdate=2010-05-12 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202201725/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFD91031F93AA25756C0A967958260 | archivedate=2009-02-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ingle's approach, as described in his own words, reflects the early inspiration of the magic realism movement as described by Roh; that is, the aim is not to add magical elements to a realistic painting, but to pursue a radically faithful rendering of reality; the "magic" effect on the viewer comes from the intensity of that effort: "I don't want to make arbitrary changes in what I see to paint the picture, I want to paint what is given. The whole idea is to take something that's given and explore that reality as intensely as I can."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/biography.aspx?searchtype=BIO&amp;artist=71244|title=John Ingle - Artist Biography for John Ingle|author=|date=|website=www.askart.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225180854/http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/biography.aspx?searchtype=BIO&amp;artist=71244|archivedate=25 February 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnsandford.org/other1.html|title=The Eye and the Heart: The Watercolors of John Stuart Ingle|first=Roswell Anthony|last=Camp|date=|website=www.johnsandford.org|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120906215140/http://www.johnsandford.org/other1.html|archivedate=6 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later development: magic realism that incorporates the fantastic===
[[File:PaulCadmusTheFleetsIn.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cadmus]], ''The Fleet's In!'' 1934]]

While Ingle represents a "magic realism" that harks back to Roh's ideas, the term "magic realism" in mid-20th century visual art tends to refer to work that incorporates overtly fantastic elements, somewhat in the manner of its literary counterpart.

Occupying an intermediate place in this line of development, the work of several European and American painters whose most important work dates from the 1930s through to the 1950s, including [[Bettina Shaw-Lawrence]], [[Paul Cadmus]], [[Ivan Albright]], [[Philip Evergood]], [[George Tooker]], [[Ricco]], even [[Andrew Wyeth]], such as in his well-known work [[Christina's World]],&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78455''Christina's World''] in the [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] Online Collection&lt;/ref&gt; is designated as "magic realist". This work departs sharply from Roh's definition, in that it (according to artcyclopedia.com) "is anchored in everyday reality, but has overtones of fantasy or wonder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/magic-realism.html|title=Magic Realism|author=|date=|website=www.artcyclopedia.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091001010202/http://www.artcyclopedia.com/history/magic%2Drealism.html|archivedate=1 October 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work of Cadmus, for example, the surreal atmosphere is sometimes achieved via stylized distortions or exaggerations that are not realistic.

Recent "magic realism" has gone beyond mere "overtones" of the fantastic or surreal to depict a frankly magical reality, with an increasingly tenuous anchoring in "everyday reality". Artists associated with this kind of magic realism include [[Marcela Donoso]]&lt;ref&gt;Elga Perez-Laborde:"Marcela Donoso," ''jornal do Brasilia'', 10/10/1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elga Perez-Laborde:"Prologo,"''Iconografía de Mitos y Leyendas, Marcela Donoso'', {{ISBN|978-956-291-592-2}}. 12/2002&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=May 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;"with an impressive chromatic delivery, images come immersed in such a magic realism full of symbols," ''El Mercurio - Chile'', 06/22/1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Antonio Fernandez, Director of the Art Museum of Universidad de Concepción:"I was impressed by her original iconographic creativity, that in a way very close to magic realism, achieves to emphasize with precision the subjects specific to each folkloric tradition, local or regional," Chile, 29/12/1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marceladonoso.cl {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202060957/http://www.marceladonoso.cl/ |date=2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gregory Gillespie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03EFDE1E3BF931A1575AC0A9669C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=ART IN REVIEW; Gregory Gillespie | first=Ken | last=Johnson | date=2000-09-22 | accessdate=2010-05-12 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202214856/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03EFDE1E3BF931A1575AC0A9669C8B63 | archivedate=2009-02-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/gillespie_gregory.html|title=Gregory Gillespie Online|author=|date=|website=www.artcyclopedia.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120723213032/http://www.artcyclopedia.com/artists/gillespie_gregory.html|archivedate=23 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E3DF1731F930A15756C0A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=ART IN REVIEW; James Valerio | first=Ken | last=Johnson | date=2003-05-23 | accessdate=2010-05-12 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202211153/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E3DF1731F930A15756C0A9659C8B63 | archivedate=2009-02-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists such as [[Peter Doig]], [[Richard T. Scott]] and Will Teather have become associated with the term in the early 21st century.

==Film and television==
Magical realism is not an officially recognized [[film genre]], but characteristics of magic realism present in literature can also be found in many moving pictures with fantasy elements. These characteristics may be presented matter-of-factly and occur without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hurd | first = Mary | title = Women directors and their films | publisher = Praeger | date = November 30, 2006 | pages = 73| isbn = 978-0-275-98578-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many films have magical realist narrative and events that contrast between real and magical elements, or different modes of production. This device explores the reality of what exists.&lt;ref name="Bowers, Maggie A. 2004"/&gt;{{rp|109–11}} Fredrick Jameson, in "On Magic Realism in Film", advances a hypothesis that magical realism in film is a formal mode that is constitutionally dependent on a type of historical raw material in which disjunction is structurally present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jameson|first=Fredric|year=1986|title=On Magic Realism in Film|journal=Critical Inquiry|publisher=University of Chicago Press|volume=12|issue=2|jstor=1343476|page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Zamora | first = Lois Parkinson | authorlink = |author2=Faris, Wendy B | title = Magical Realism: Theory, History, Community | publisher = Duke University Press Books | date = November 30, 1995 | pages = 426 | isbn = 978-0-8223-1640-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|Like Water for Chocolate]]'' (1992) begins and ends with the first person narrative to establishing the magical realism storytelling frame. Telling a story from a child's point of view, the historical gaps and holes perspective, and with cinematic color heightening the presence, are magical realist tools in films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hegerfeld | first = Anne | title = Lies that Tell the Truth: Magic Realism Seen through Contemporary Fiction from Britain (Costerus NS 155) | publisher = Rodopi | date = January 13, 2005 | pages = 147 | isbn = 978-90-420-1974-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other films that convey elements of magic realism are ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'' (1999), ''[[Amélie]]'' (2001), ''[[The Mistress of Spices]]'' (2005), ''[[Undertow (2009 film)|Undertow]]'' (2009), ''[[Biutiful]]'' (2010), ''[[Beasts of the Southern Wild]]'' (2012), ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'' (2014), a number of films by [[Woody Allen]] (including ''[[The Purple Rose of Cairo]]'' (1985), ''[[Alice (1990 film)|Alice]]'' (1990), ''[[Midnight in Paris]]'' (2011), ''[[Scoop (2006 film)|Scoop]]'' (2006), and ''[[To Rome with Love (film)|To Rome With Love]]'' (2012)). Additionally, most of the films directed by [[Terry Gilliam]] are strongly influenced by magic realism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rushdie|first1=Salam|title=Salam Rushdie talks with Terry Gilliam|url=http://www.believermag.com/issues/200303/?read=interview_gilliam|website=The Believer|publisher=believermag.com|accessdate=25 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616153340/http://www.believermag.com/issues/200303/?read=interview_gilliam|archivedate=16 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the animated films of [[Hayao Miyazaki]] often utilize magic realism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zeitchik|first1=Steven|title='The Wind Rises': Five things to know about Miyazaki's new movie|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-the-wind-rises-miyazaki-movie-20130916-story.html|accessdate=25 June 2017|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=16 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722150111/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-the-wind-rises-miyazaki-movie-20130916-story.html|archivedate=22 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some of the films of [[Emir Kusturica]] contain elements of magical realism, the most famous of which is ''[[Time of the Gypsies]]'' (1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Kevin|title=Entering the Oscar Race Via Magic and Realism|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-09/entertainment/ca-408_1_emir-kusturica|accessdate=25 June 2017|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=9 February 1990|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425234831/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-09/entertainment/ca-408_1_emir-kusturica|archivedate=25 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magical realism is referred to in the 2015 [[Netflix]] series ''[[Narcos#Opening theme and title sequence|Narcos]]'', which opens with a title card, from which the narrator reads: "Magical realism is defined as what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe. There is a reason magical realism was born in Colombia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= REVIEW: 'Narcos' state of mind, ALWAYS RIGHT NOW |author= Almario, Alex |newspaper= The Philippine Star |date= September 24, 2016 |url= http://www.philstar.com/supreme/2016/09/24/1626768/review-narcos-state-mind |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161220222521/http://www.philstar.com/supreme/2016/09/24/1626768/review-narcos-state-mind |archivedate= December 20, 2016 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/review-netflixs-narcos-takes-on-the-legend-of-pablo-escobar/|author=Sepinwall, Alan|title=Review: Netflix's 'Narcos' takes on the legend of Pablo Escobar|date=August 27, 2016|work=What's Alan Watching?|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220053028/http://uproxx.com/sepinwall/review-netflixs-narcos-takes-on-the-legend-of-pablo-escobar/|archivedate=December 20, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video games and new media==

Early video games such as the 1986 text adventure ''[[Trinity (video game)|Trinity]]'' combined elements of science fiction, fantasy and magic realism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roger Tringham|first1=Neal|title=Science Fiction Video Games|date=2015|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, USA|isbn=978-1-4822-0389-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay ''Half-Real'', [[MIT]] professor and [[Game studies|ludologist]] Jesper Juul argues that the intrinsic nature of video games is magic realist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jull|first1=Jesper|title=Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds|date=2015|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780262101103|edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adventure game#Point-and-click adventure games|Point and click]] adventure games such as the 2017 release ''Memoranda'' have recently embraced the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memoranda|url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/430410/Memoranda/|website=Steam|publisher=Digital Dragon|accessdate=24 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622010214/http://store.steampowered.com/app/430410/Memoranda|archivedate=22 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013 release ''[[Kentucky Route Zero]]'' is also deeply entrenched in magical realist tradition.

In electronic literature, early author [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]'s ''Afternoon, a story'' deploys the ambiguity and dubious narrator characteristic of high modernism, along with some suspense and romance elements, in a story whose meaning could change dramatically depending on the path taken through its lexias on each reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Jill|title=Piecing together and tearing apart: finding the story in afternoon|url=http://jilltxt.net/txt/afternoon.html|website=jill/txt|publisher=ACM Hypertext 1999 conference|accessdate=24 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315021903/http://jilltxt.net/txt/afternoon.html|archivedate=15 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Pamela Sacred perpetuated the genre through ''La Voie de l'ange'', a continuation of ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' written in French by a fictional character from her ''The Passengers'' hypertext saga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nilufar|first1=Najwa|title=La Voie de l'ange|url=http://episodia.org/wiki/The_Passengers|website=The Passengers|publisher=Episodia|accessdate=24 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615050126/http://episodia.org/wiki/The_Passengers|archivedate=15 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Ukrainian Academy of Arts''' ({{lang-ua|Академія мистецтв України (АМУ)}}) is a state scientific and artistic institution in the field of art, culture, and art history in [[Ukraine]]. The academy is one of the six state funded institutions along with the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]] that was established in 1996 and obtained its National status in 2010. The membership to the academy is on an electoral basis for the distinguished specialists of professional artistry: theater and film directors, composers, painters, conductors, actors etc.

==History==
===Origin=== 
The work of [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy#Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv-Mohyla]] and [[Ostroh Academy|Ostroh Academies]] had a strong influence on the development of Ukrainian Arts in the 16th and 17th centuries. Theatrical performances, dramas, and music concerts performed by students with other important events have taken place in the aforementioned academies on the eve of holidays and festivals. In general, the foundation of academies in Ukraine is historically connected with the growth of the cultural level of Ukrainian society and with essential changes in the development of the education of artists. Increasing the possibilities for development of talented youth’s creativity and carrying out complex, scientific research lies at the base of academics.

===First academy (1918)===
On the 18th of December 1917, the Ukrainian State Academy of Arts (nowadays [[The National Academy of Fine Arts and Architecture]]), was founded. The founding of the Academy, one of the highest level art education centers in Europe, and its further development in the history of Ukrainian culture was a remarkable event in the life of Ukrainian Art and is regarded as continuing glamorous Ukrainian traditions in Art and the realization of nation’s cultural needs and desires. In 1922 the Academy was reorganized and renamed the Institution of Plastic Arts. In 1924 it was renamed Kyiv Fine Arts Institute.

===After liquidation===
The creative potential of the outstanding masters of Ukrainian culture required further development. So the idea of founding an Academy of a scientific-creative type appeared in the 1920s. From 1927 to 1928, on behalf of the government, the presidium of the Ukrainian Academy of Science formed a special committee headed by AS academician of Ukraine O. P. Novytskyy. The committee prepared special documents so that the Ukrainian Academy of Arts could be established. Afterwards, due to repressions of artistic intelligentsia, of which a number of art critics, for example F. L. Ernst, M. F. Bilyashyvskyy, D. M. Scherbakivskyy, M. O. Makarenko and others were subjected, the foundation of the Academy was postponed. In 1941 at the request of artistic intelligentsia the Ukrainian authorities resumed planning for the Academy’s foundation, but this time the [[Second World War]] was the obstacle.

Right after the war a range of scientific research institutions for building-architectural and artistic profile were opened in Ukraine within the Academy of Architecture (in 1956 it was reorganized into the URSS Academy of Architecture and Building and it was liquidated in 1964). The Institution on the Theory and History of Architecture, the Institution of Monumental Painting and Sculpture, and the Institution of Artistic Industry were among them. Scientific Research departments on the theory and history of Art, post graduate education, workshops for art critics, artists and architects were contained in the structure of these establishments. The masters of Art and Architecture P. O. Biletskyy, H. N. Lohvyn, V. H. Zabolotnyy, P. M. Zholtovskyy, O. S. Shovkunenko carried out theoretical and practical work there.

Numerous fundamental works on the History of Art and Architecture were published during those days, including “The History of the Ukrainian Art” in six volumes. In 1960 many of the scientific research institutions within the Academy of Architecture and Building were liquidated while others were distributed into different departments. Haphazard reorganization and eradication of the Ukrainian Art School in the years of repression destroyed a rich inheritance of traditions and ideas. From 1970s to 1980s, the art community brought up the question a number of times of founding the Academy and its corresponding institutions. At last the idea of organizing the State Scientific Research Institution was approved by the Ukrainian government and was fulfilled on December 14, 1996.

{{Culture of Pakistan}}

[[Pakistan]] has a wide variety of [[folklore]], mostly circulated regionally. However, certain tales have related variants in other regions of the country or in [[neighbouring]] [[countries]]. ''Pakistani [[mythology]]'' here means the myths and sacred narratives of the culturally and linguistically [[Indo-Iranians|related groups of ancient peoples]] who inhabited the region of Pakistan and its borderlands.

==Music==
{{Main article|Pakistani folk music}}

== Provincial folklore ==
The provinces of Pakistan are known by the love stories in their folklore that have been immortalized by singers, reciters and storytellers of the regions.

=== Sindhi folklore ===
{{Main article|Sindhi folklore}}
'''Sindhi folklore''' ({{lang-sd|'''  لوڪ ادب'''}}) is the [[folklore|folk]] tradition which has developed in Sindh over a number of centuries.Sindh abounds with folklore, in all forms, and colors from such obvious manifestations as the traditional [[Watayo Faqir]] tales, the legend of ''Moriro'', epic tale of [[Dodo Soomro|Dodo Chanesar]], to the heroic character of [[Marui]] which distinguishes it among the contemporary folklores of the region. The love story of [[Sassui Punhun|Sassui]], who pines for her lover Punhu, is known and sung in every Sindhi settlement.  Other examples of the folklore of Sindh include the stories of Umar Marui and Suhuni Mehar.&lt;ref&gt;Kalyan Adwani, ed. ''[[Shah Jo Risalo]]''. [[Jamshoro]]: Sindhi Adabi Board, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Sindhi folk Singers and women play a vital role to transmit the Sindhi folklore. They sang the [[Sindhi folk tales|folktales of Sindh]] in songs with passion in every village of Sindh.

Sindhi folklore has been compiled in  a series of forty volumes under [[Sindhi Adabi Board]]'s project of '''Folklore and Literature'''.This valuable project was accomplished by noted sindhi scholar [[Nabi Bux Khan Baloch|Dr.Nabi Bux Baloch]].The material for the project has been collected both from the oral traditions village folks and the written record. This folklore series deals with diverse segments Sindhi folklore and literature i.e. Fables and Fairy-tales, pseudo-historical Romances, Folk-poetry, Folk songs, Proverbs, Riddles etc.

=== Balochi folklore ===
[[Balochi language|Balochi]] folklore is alive with the love stories of [[Hani and Sheh Mureed|Hani and Shah Murad Chakar]], [[Shahdad and Mahnaz]], [[Lallah and Granaz]], [[Bebarg and Granaz]], and [[Mast and Sammo]], among others. The war tales of the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] are equally stirring. The ''[[chap (dance)|chap]]'', a [[Baloch people|Baloch]] style of dancing, has a curious rhythm distinguished by an inertial back sway with every forward step. Baloch music has a unique flavour of its own.

=== Kashmiri folklore ===
[[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]] regions in the north are equally rich in folklore.

=== Pakhtun folklore ===
In the [[Pukhtun]] areas of the northwest, the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] is the home of energetic warlike dancers, the most prominent being the Khattak dance, which bears the name of the tribe that dances it. The romantic tale of [[Adam Khan And Durkhanai|Adam Khan]] and Durkhanai features a lute player (''[[rabab]]'') whose music earns the love of a beautiful girl, although she hasn't seen him yet.

=== Punjabi folklore ===
{{Main article|Punjabi folklore}}
Many folk tales from [[Punjab region|Punjab]] have been disseminated worldwide by the [[Punjabi diaspora]], especially in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and United States. The tale of two lovers, [[Heer Ranjha|Heer]] and Ranjha, is based in the [[Pakistan]]i part of the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], in a city called [[Jhang]]. Today it is celebrated in songs, movies, theatre, and quotations. One may call a romantic person a Ranjha, meaning he is a devoted lover. Similarly a girl in love may be called "Heer." Apart from the epic of Hir and Ranjha, the Punjab has a rich tradition of ballads, folk tales, folk music and dance. The folklore of the Potohar Plateau of the north shows a local variant, while the lush green irrigated agriculture of the central plains is home to more sophisticated forms of folklore. The oldest living urban centre of Multan in the south is home to gentler forms of music and dance.

=== Saraiki folklore ===
[[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] areas in the south are equally rich in folklore.

== External folklore ==

[[File:Parachico.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Parachico|Parachico dancers]]
The '''''Parachico''''' or '''''Parachicos''''' are traditional dancers from [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa de Corzo]], [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], who dance on the streets of the town during the Great Feast festivity, which takes place from January 15 to 23 every year. The festivity takes place in honor of the local patron saints [[Black Christ of Esquipulas]], [[Saint Anthony Abbot]] and [[Saint Sebastian]]. It is claimed locally, as many of the Catholic festivals are in Latin America, to have its roots in the much older indigenous culture. So it has developed into a hybrid of old indigenous culture and newer Catholic and Spanish cultures. The church where the festival concludes is home to an old tree, which is said to represent the "tree of life" (drawing on Maya and other pre-Hispanic American cultures), which is claimed locally to predate the church, which would suggest that this site was used for ceremonies before the arrival of Catholicism. Honoring the mother of the cured boy (for the feast) is also locally explained, why on certain nights during  the festival, the town's men dress as women and parade through the streets.

The festivities, which include [[Roman Catholic]] religious ceremonies, music, dancing and local cuisine, have been included in [[UNESCO]]'s [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]] on November 16, 2010, listed as "Parachicos in the traditional January feast of Chiapa de Corzo".&lt;ref name=parachico_UNESCO&gt;{{cite web| title=Parachicos in the traditional January feast of Chiapa de Corzo|url= http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00399 |publisher=UNESCO Culture Sector |accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Chiapadecorzo flickr02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=Parachicos on the streets|Parachicos dancing on the streets of [[Chiapa de Corzo, Chiapas|Chiapa de Corzo]]]]It has pre hispanic origins, however, the traditional dates back to the seventeenth century with the arrival of the image of San Sebastian Martyr to the then Royal Villa Chiapa or Chiapa of the indians and the building of the temple, completed in the seventeenth century. There are many versions of the history of parachico but all agree to the myth that one day a beautiful woman seeking a cure for her sick son but after visiting doctor and healers, failed to alleviate it. Someone told her to go Chiapas where surely  find the cure, then she moved with all its servants.

She wanted to consult a famous indian healer and went to visit him: "Make way going to spend my lady Maria de Angulo" shouted the servants. The healer recommended to the spanish rich take her sick child to the healing waters of cumbujuyú and bathe him for nine days. This done, the child was healed and in gratitude Maria de Angulo gave food and groceries, while the costumed servants danced to entertain children. 
Others attribute from the name "para chico", translated to for (the) boy.

==Attire==
Parachicos wear wooden masks with [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] features, such as light skin, facial hair and blue eyes, in contrast to Native people's features. They also wear a round headdress, colorful ribbons, striped [[serapes]], embroidered shawls, usually over black or dark shirt and trousers.
Parachicos use metallic [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]] locally known as ''chinchin'' or  ''chinchines'', with colorful ribbons attached to the top and/or handles, which are shaken as they dance and chant.

== Declaration as Intangible Cultural Heritage ==
[[File:ParachicosPlaque.jpg|thumb|[[:es:Unesco|UNESCO]] declared plate as intangible cultural heritage]]
On November 16, 2010, the act of parachicos was declared Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO. The decision was adopted at the meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage, held in Nairobi, Kenya, under the name "Parachicos in the traditional January feast of Chiapa de Corzo

[[File:Rogier_van_der_Weyden_-_Piet%C3%A0_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|thumb|300px|Rogier van der Weyden, ''Pietà'', c 1441.&lt;ref name= "date"&gt;Campbell &amp; Van der Stock, p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; Oil on oak panel, 32.5cm x 45.8cm. [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]]]

'''''Pietà''''' is a painting by the Flemish artist [[Rogier van der Weyden]] dating from about 1441 held in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], Brussels. There are number of workshop versions and copies, notably in the [[National Gallery]], London, in the [[Prado]], Madrid, and in the Manzoni Collection, Naples.&lt;ref name= "versions"&gt;Campbell (1998) p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; Infra-red and X-radiograph evidence suggest that the Brussels version was painted by van der Weyden himself, not necessarily excluding the help of workshop assistants.&lt;ref name= "attribution"&gt;Campbell &amp; Van der Stock pp. 506-7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dendrochronological]] analysis gives a felling date of 1431 for the oak panel backing, supporting the dating of the painting to around 1441.&lt;ref name= "date"/&gt;

Campbell &amp; van der Stock describe the painting as evincing a technical and aesthetic mastery in no way inferior to that of ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|The Descent from the Cross]]'', of comparable emotional force and controlled by an equally strongly balanced composition. Christ's dead body is conceived in a similarly natural way as in the ''Descent'', the dangling arms and limp fingers typical of van der Weyden's acute observation. The conspicuous elongation of Christ's wrists has been explained away as the ineptness of an assistant, but equally it might be a consequence of Christ's hanging on the Cross, the kind of realistic detail characteristic of van der Weyden.&lt;ref name= "description"&gt;Campbell &amp; Van der Stock p. 507&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a fair number of imitations were made of the Brussels version, only a few were based directly on it. A direct connection can be seen only in the versions belonging to the Rademakers collection in The Hague, the [[Museum Mayer van den Bergh]], Antwerp, and the Manzoni collection, Naples. The Manzoni version combines features from the Brussels version as well as those of the Madrid version and another in the [[Staatliche Museen]], Berlin.&lt;ref name="description"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Djikstra, pp. 451-61, 255-7 and n. 507&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pompeii Lakshmi''' is an ivory statuette that was discovered in the ruins of [[Pompeii]], which was destroyed in the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]] 79 CE. She was found by Amedeo Maiuri an Italian scholar in 1938.&lt;ref name="Ancona" /&gt; The statuette has been dated to the first-century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=i402017|title=Vol. 32, No. 24, May 8, 1939 of The Classical Weekly on JSTOR|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statuette is thought of representing an Indian goddess of feminine beauty and fertility. It is possible that the sculpture originally formed the handle of a mirror.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1939|title=Abstracts of Articles|jstor=4340562|journal=The Classical Weekly|volume=32|issue=18|pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakshmi is a reminder of commercial trade of goods and resources between India and Italy in the first century A.D. Over the years historians have been able to connect Roman trade with the far east specifically India.

Originally, it was thought that the statuette represented the goddess [[Lakshmi]], a goddess of fertility, beauty and wealth, revered by early [[Buddhist]]s, [[Hindu]]s and [[Jainism|Jains]].&lt;ref name="Beard"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-H6HsNEWLhYC&amp;pg=PA24|title=Pompeii: The Life of a Roman Town|last1=Beard|first=Mary|date=2010|publisher=Profile Books|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wangu |first1=Madhu Bazaz |title=Images of Indian Goddesses: Myths, Meanings, and Models |date=2003 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=9788170174165 |page=57 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8y-vKtqCmIC&amp;pg=PA57 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the iconography reveals that the figure is more likely to depict a ''[[yakshi]]'', a female tree spirit that represents fertility, or possibly a syncretic version of Venus-Sri-Lakshmi from an ancient exchange between Classical Greco-Roman and [[Indian culture]]s.&lt;ref name="Ancona" /&gt;

The figure is now in the [[Secret Museum, Naples|Secret Museum]] in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].&lt;ref name="Museo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museoarcheologiconapoli.it/en/room-and-sections-of-the-exhibition/3490-2/|title=Lakshmi|work=Museo Archeologico Napoli|access-date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents ==
The statuette was discovered in October 1938 beside the Casa dei Quattro stili at Pompeii.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Standing at 0.25 m. high the statuette is nearly naked apart from her narrow girdle and lavish jewels as well as an elaborate coiffure. She has two female attendants, one facing outward on each side, holding cosmetics containers.&lt;ref name="Beard" /&gt; The statuette has a hole bored down from the top of her head. There is the theory that its purpose may have been a mirror handle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The existence of this statuette in Pompeii by 79 CE, when [[Mount Vesuvius]] erupted and buried the city, testifies to the intensity of [[Indo-Roman trade relations]] during the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Beard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foglia"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RainC5KUCIEC&amp;pg=PA43|title=Secrets of Pompeii: Everyday Life in Ancient Rome|last1=De Albentiis|first1=Emidio|last2=Foglia|first2=Alfredo|date=2009|publisher=Getty Publications|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statuette has been dated by the Naples National Archaeological Museum as having been created in India in the first half of that century.&lt;ref name="Museo"/&gt;

== Trade ==
Though the origin is not entirely certain, based on archeological finds and historian work, the Pompeii Lakshmi has had a questionable origin. There is evidence of the then active trade routes between the [[Roman Empire]] under [[Nero|Emperor Nero]] and India during this time period.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollard|first=Elizabeth Ann|date=2013-08-07|title=Indian Spices and Roman "Magic" in Imperial and Late Antique Indomediterranea|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/516208|journal=Journal of World History|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–23|doi=10.1353/jwh.2013.0012|issn=1527-8050}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pollard, with the Roman long-distance trade, she is believed to have found herself in the city during the reign of [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The archeological evidence suggests that the height of trade between Roman and India appears to have been the first and second centuries C.E. This trade took place along several routes, both overland as documented by [[Isidore of Charax]]’s ''Parthian Stations,'' and by sea as the merchant guide known as the ''[[Periplus Maris Erythraei]]'' reveals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a possibility that the statuette found its way to the west during the rule of [[Western Satrap]] [[Nahapana]] in the [[Bhokardan]] area, and was shipped from the port of [[Barigaza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brancaccio |first1=Pia |title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion |date=2010 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004185259 |page=64 Note 94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA64 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rome played an important part in the Eastern oriental trade of antiquity, they imported many goods from India and at the same time set up their own trading stations in the country.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Matthew Adam|date=April 2013|title=THE RECEPTION AND CONSUMPTION OF EASTERN GOODS IN ROMAN SOCIETY|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/greece-and-rome/article/the-reception-and-consumption-of-eastern-goods-in-roman-society/AB382741FDBC75BFFE346C155DAC84AE|journal=Greece &amp;amp; Rome|volume=60|issue=1|pages=136–152|doi=10.1017/S0017383512000307|issn=0017-3835}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cobb, trading through land routes such as crossing the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Mesopotamia]], and through seaborne trade from the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]] were used by the Romans.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The sea routes that utilized the winds of the Indian Ocean was able to create a significant volume of goods to be imported from the East on ships. The wealth of the trade was significant enough for Pliny to claim that 100 million sesterces were being sent annually to India, China, and Arabia.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With shipments of nard, ivory, and textiles it is clear from the archaeological evidence, that Roman trade with the East peaked in the first and second centuries A.D.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Origin==
[[File:Pompeii Lakshmi before reconstitution.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The statuette before reconstitution.]]
[[File:Letter Shi in Kharosthi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Kharosthi]] letter ''śi'' was inscribed on the base of the statuette.&lt;ref name="Maiuri"/&gt;]]
It was initially assumed that the statuette had been produced at [[Mathura]], but according to Dhavalikar, it is now thought that its place of production was [[Bhokardan]] since two similar figurines were discovered there.&lt;ref name=MKD&gt;{{cite book |last=Dhavalikar |first=M. K. |editor1-last=Kulkarni |editor1-first=A. R. |editor2-last=Wagle |editor2-first=N. K. |date=1999 |title=Region, Nationality and Religion |chapter=Chapter 4: Maharashatra: Environmental and Historical Process |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7f0JEWk6HMC&amp;pg=PA46|publisher=Popular Prakashan |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhodarkan was a part of the [[Satavahana]] territory and cultural sphere, although it might have been held for a few decades by the [[Western Satraps]], who may have been the ones who provided an export route to the Roman world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brancaccio |first1=Pia |title=The Buddhist Caves at Aurangabad: Transformations in Art and Religion |date=2010 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004185259 |page=64 Note 94 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_4pXm7dD78C&amp;pg=PA64 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an inscriptive mark in [[Kharosthi]] at the base of the Pompeii statuette (the letter śi, as the śi in [[Shiva]]).&lt;ref name="Maiuri"&gt;Statuetta eburnea di arte indiana a Pompei, Maiuri [http://www.bollettinodarte.beniculturali.it/opencms/multimedia/BollettinoArteIt/documents/1434379819195_03_-_A._Maiuri_p._111.pdf p.112]&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests she might have originated from the northwestern regions of India, Pakistan, or Afghanistan, or at least passed through these areas.&lt;ref name="MMA"&gt;Afghanistan: Forging Civilizations Along the Silk Road, Joan Aruz, Elisabetta Valtz Fino, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2012 [https://books.google.com/books?id=p4_it5yw9WsC&amp;pg=PA75 p.75]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Pompeii statuette was necessarily made sometime before 79 CE, if it was indeed manufactured in [[Gandhara]], it would suggest that the [[Begram ivories]] are also of this early date, in the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="MMA"/&gt;

===Iconography===
The statuette is represented in the round, and the center of two other female figures. The legs are turned to its side and one arm bent to hold earrings. She is presumed to only be looked at front the front because the details from the back are very flat. As stated by D’Ancona, the iconography falls into the broad category of female deities in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RainC5KUCIEC&amp;pg=PA43#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Secrets of Pompeii: Everyday Life in Ancient Rome|last=Albentiis|first=Emidio De|last2=Foglia|first2=Alfredo|date=2009|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=9780892369416|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a case of cross-cultural pollination, the theme of the goddess attended by two child attendants, which can be seen in the case of the Pompeii Lakshmi, is an uncommon depiction of Lakshmi or Yashis in [[Indian art]]. It lacks the [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus flower]] found in Lakshmi iconography. According to D'Ancona, the iconography represented in this statuette may have been imported from the Classical world, possibly derived from the iconography of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] attended by [[Putto|cherubs]] holding cosmetics containers, which are well known in Greco-Roman art. She may be one of the several representations of Venus-Sri-Lakshmi that appeared in the 1st century CE, states D'Ancona.&lt;ref name="Ancona"&gt;An Indian Statuette from Pompeii, Mirella Levi D' Ancona, Artibus Asiae, Vol. 13, No. 3 (1950), [https://ja.scribd.com/document/260301968/An-Indian-Statuette-From-Pompeii pp. 166-180]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pompeii Lakshmi would therefore be a mixture of Indian and Classical art.&lt;ref name="Ancona" /&gt;

[[:File:Lakshmi Sanchi Stupa 2.jpg|An early relief]] from [[Sanchi Stupa No.2]] with a broadly similar scene of Lakshmi with two child attendants may have served as the initial inspiration for the Pompeii Lakshmi, especially knowing that the [[Satavahanas]] were in control of Sanchi from 50 BCE onward.&lt;ref name="Ancona"/&gt; It is thought that these early reliefs at Sanchi Stupa No.2 were made by craftsmen from the northwest, specifically from the [[Indo-Greek]] region of [[Gandhara]], as the reliefs bear mason's marks in [[Kharoshthi]], as opposed to the local [[Brahmi]] script.&lt;ref name="AG"/&gt; The craftsmen were probably responsible for the foreign-looking motifs and figures that can be found on the railings of the stupa.&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology, by [[Amalananda Ghosh]], BRILL [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Wba-EZhZcfgC&amp;pg=PA295 p.295]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Puddle''''' is a [[woodcut]] print by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]], first printed in February 1952.

Since 1936, Escher’s work had become primarily focused on [[Paradox|paradoxes]], [[tessellation]] and other abstract visual concepts. This print, however, is a realistic depiction of a simple image that portrays two perspectives at once. It depicts an unpaved road with a large pool of water in the middle of it at twilight. Turning the print upside-down and focusing strictly on the reflection in the water, it becomes a depiction of a forest with a full moon overhead. The road is soft and muddy and in it there are two distinctly different sets of tire tracks, two sets of footprints going in opposite directions and two bicycle tracks. Escher has thus captured three elements: the water, sky and earth.

'''Quadrangular tower''' ({{lang-az|Dördbucaqlı qala}}) or '''Keep of the fortress of Baku''' ({{lang-az|Bakı qalasının donjonu}}) is a historic tower of XIV century. The tower is also referred as a [[keep]]. It is a part of [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] and located on Kichik Gala street, in the city of [[Baku]], in [[Azerbaijan]]. The building was also registered as a national architectural monument by the decision of the [[Cabinet of Azerbaijan|Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Azerbaijan]] dated August 2, 2001, No. 132.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azərbaycan Respublikası ərazisində dövlət mühafizəsinə götürülmüş daşınmaz tarix və mədəniyyət abidələrinin əhəmiyyət dərəcələrinə görə bölgüsünün təsdiq edilməsi haqqında Azərbaycan Respublikasi Nazirlər Kabinetinin qərarı|url=http://www.e-qanun.az/framework/2847|website=e-qanun.az|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The tower was built in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="icherisheheraz"&gt;{{cite web|title= Dördbucaqlı qala (XIV əsr)|url= http://www.icherisheher.az/az/53-defensive-structures|publisher= icherisheher.az|language= az|accessdate= 15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The towers were built as an integral part of the [[Baku Fortress Wall|fortress wall]] while building defensive fortifications in [[Baku]], to maintain the look, the strength of the fortress walls and to make the defense system even easier. According to writings of medieval authors, within 70 semicircular and northern fortress walls there was a quadrangular fortress-type tower. In the [[Middle Ages]], either during the period of stability or in war, it was used as a weapon armory. The fortress-tower was built mainly for two purposes:  controlling the area to further strengthen the northern part of Baku by forming a view of the fortress walls and to use the tower as a weapon storage.&lt;ref name="icherisheher"&gt;{{cite web|title= Dördbucaqlı Qala|url= http://www.icherisheher.gov.az/static,20/lang,az/#monument29|publisher= icherisheher.gov.az|language= az|accessdate= 15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 substantial repair and restoration works were held on the tower by Old City State Historical-Architectural Reserve Department and after that it started to operate as Old City Traditional Art Center under the name of The Tower of Arts.

==Architectural features==
The height of the tower is 16 m, the thickness of the walls is 2 meters. For rapid movement of soldiers, an underground path, which continued along the bottom of the wall, was directed towards the tower gate. This underground path surrounded the city by the northern side.&lt;ref name="icherisheheraz"/&gt;

{{Literature}}
A '''rhapsode''' ({{lang-el|ῥαψῳδός, "rhapsōidos"}}) or, in modern usage, '''rhapsodist''', refers to a [[classical Greece|classical Greek]] professional performer of [[epic poetry]]&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Rhapsodist |volume=23 |page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the fifth and fourth centuries BC (and perhaps earlier). Rhapsodes notably performed the epics of [[Homer]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; (''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'') but also the [[Wisdom literature|wisdom]] and catalogue poetry of [[Hesiod]] and the [[satires]] of [[Archilochus]] and others. [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', in which [[Socrates]] confronts a star player rhapsode, remains the most coherent source of information on these artists. Often, rhapsodes are depicted in [[Ancient Greek art|Greek art]], wearing their signature cloak and carrying a staff. This equipment is also characteristic of travellers in general, implying that rhapsodes were itinerant performers, moving from town to town. Rhapsodes originated in the Ionian district, which has been sometimes regarded as [[Homer]]'s birthplace, and were also known as Homeridai, disciples of Homer, or "singers of stitched lays."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Oral Interpretation|author1=Bahn, E.  |author2=Bahn, M.L. |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Burgess|year = 1970|isbn = |location = Minneapolis, MN|pages = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
Today we think of rhapsode as a way of taking prose and amplifying it until it reaches levels of expectation that few can understand, so in reality rhapsode is the ultimate form of prose, poem and literature and even the most talented of writers dont' usually understand that rhapsode is an art form in itself to be mastered, controlled and shared. Rhapsode is like a sympathy of instruments that is perfectly played to precision with an ultimate goal in mind. For example, here is prose that would be considered to be rhapsode.

::''The child broke down when she finally understood that she was an intellectual even though all those around her chastised her, hurt her to the point of death a multitude of times but through the years she finally understood she was rhapsode, because she was not only their superior, but she was humble, kind, forgiving and most of all a symphony of instruments that were playing in perfect harmony that no one else could hear but her, and this was her torment. While she knew what was true and right, all those around her continued harm her in the most evil of ways, and finally she broke down and no longer contributed to the good of mankind, but instead became a recluse who could have cured the most horrible diseases known to man, but instead she was too broken to contribute and so she stayed as recluse in her basement for all eternity. Her crime was letting evil control her, because evil is what man is, and control is how he empowers himself, and if one of us lets this steal their heart, then they are the ones to blame, but they cannot blame the evil because blame is weakness. The child learn early to be strong and that evil is as evil does and evil will always exist, but we all have choice, and choices are something we can own no matter what our circumstances are, we always have a choice. When the child finally understood this she broke down and cried, but her tears meant nothing to her tormentors because they only wanted to bring out her evil, but she had none to show, and so she won, and they became her victims and the broken child finally understood that she was an intellectual and no one else around her mattered because they were simply nothingness and no one but empty faces in the wind.''

The reason this is rhapsode is because there is moral, a tale and an ending that matters.
--&gt;

==Etymology and usage==
The term "rhapsode" is derived from ''rhapsōidein'' (ῥαψῳδεῖν), meaning "to sew songs [together]".&lt;ref&gt;Ridderstrøm, H. (2006). ''Tekstsamling I: litteraturhistorie: Litteraturhistoriske tekstpraksiser''. Oslo: Høgskolen i Oslo&lt;/ref&gt; This word illustrates how the oral epic poet, or ''rhapsode'', would build a repertoire of diverse myths, tales and jokes to include in the content of the epic poem. Thus it was possible, through experience and improvisatory skills, for him to shift the content of the [[epic poetry|epos]] according to the preferred taste of a specific location's audience. However, the outer framework of the epic would remain virtually the same in every "singing", thus securing the projection of underlying themes such as of morality or honour. The performance of epic poetry was called in classical Greek ''rhapsōidia'' (ῥαψῳδία), and its performer ''rhapsōidos''. The word does not occur in the early epics, which use the word '''''[[aoidos]]''''' (ἀοιδός "singer") for performers in all genres including this one. It is unknown whether Hesiod and the poet(s) of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and ''[[Odyssey]]'' would have recognised and accepted the name of rhapsode; it has been argued by Walter Burkert, and is accepted by some recent scholars, that ''rhapsōidos'' was by definition a performer of a fixed, written text.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{Citation | surname =Burkert | given=Walter | authorlink=Walter Burkert | chapter=The making of Homer in the 6th century BC: rhapsodes versus Stesichorus | title=Papers on the Amasis painter and his world | publisher=Getty Museum | place= Malibu | year=1987 | pages=43–62 }}; {{Citation | surname=Graziosi | given=Barbara | title=Inventing Homer: the early reception of epic | publisher=Cambridge University Press | place=Cambridge | year=2002 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''rhapsōidos'' was in use as early as [[Pindar]] (522–443 BC), who implies two different explanations of it, "singer of stitched verse", and "singer with the staff". Of these the first is etymologically correct; the second was suggested by the fact, for which there is early evidence, that the singer was accustomed to hold a staff (ῥάβδος ''rhabdos'') in his hand, perhaps, like the sceptre in the Homeric assembly, as a symbol of the right to a hearing or to "emphasize the rhythm or to give grandeur to their gestures".&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, Eugene, and Margaret L. Bahn. ''A History of Oral Interpretation.'' Minneapolis, MN: Burgess, 1979, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; The etymological meaning is interesting because it is an exact metaphor for what [[Oral poetry|oral narrative poets]] do: they stitch together formulas, lines and [[type-scene]]s in the course of performance. There are indications in Pindar and other authors that oral epic was still a living and popular tradition in the early fifth century;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | surname=Dalby | given=Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Dalby | title=[[Rediscovering Homer]] | publisher=Norton | place=New York, London | year=2006 | ISBN=0-393-05788-7 }}, pp. 157–168.&lt;/ref&gt; all the later evidence, however, is that rhapsodes worked from written texts, and in some cases were compelled by law to do so.

==Performance==
It is certain that rhapsodes performed competitively, contending for prizes at religious festivals, and that this practice was already well-established by the fifth century BC. The ''[[Iliad]]'' alludes to the myth of [[Thamyris]], the Thracian singer, who boasted that he could defeat even the Muses in song. He competed with them, was defeated, and was punished for his presumption with the loss of his ability to sing.&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'' 2.594-600; see [[scholia]] on this passage and [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], ''Library'' 1.3.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the practice is first evident in Hesiod's claim that he performed a song at the funeral games for Amphidamas in Euboea and won a prize.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Works and Days]]'' 650-662: see Hesiod, ''Theogony'' ed. [[M. L. West]] (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1966) pp. 43-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Competitive singing is depicted vividly in the ''[[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Apollo]]'' and mentioned in the two ''Hymns to Aphrodite''.&lt;ref&gt;''Homeric Hymn to Apollo'' 165-173; ''Homeric Hymns'' 5 and 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter of these may evidently be taken to belong to [[Salamis, Cyprus|Salamis]] in Cyprus and the festival of the Cyprian Aphrodite, in the same way that the ''Hymn to Apollo'' belongs to [[Delos]] and the Delian gathering.

An early historical mention of rhapsodes occurs in the ''Histories'' of [[Herodotus]] (c. 440 BC). He tells the story that at [[Sicyon]] the ruler [[Cleisthenes]] (600–560 BC) expelled the rhapsodes on account of the poems of Homer, because they promoted [[Argos]] and the [[Argives]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus 5.67.&lt;/ref&gt; This description applies very well to the ''[[Iliad]]'', in which "Argives" is one of the alternate names for the Greek warriors; it may have suited the ''[[Thebaid (Greek poem)|Thebaid]]'' still better, since Argos was named in the first line of that poem. The incident seems to show that poems performed by rhapsodes had political and propagandistic importance in the Peloponnese in the early sixth century BC.

At [[Athens]], by 330 BC, there was a law that rhapsodes should perform the Homeric poems at every [[Panathenaea|Panathenaic festival]]; this law is appealed to as glory of Athens by the orator [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lycurgus, ''Against Leocrates'' 102. The ''Iliad'' was also recited at the festival of the Brauronia, at [[Brauron]] in Attica ([[Hesychius of Alexandria|Hesychius]] s.v. ''Brauronia'').&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps therefore such a custom was exceptional, and we do not know when or by whom it was introduced, although the Platonic dialogue ''[[Hipparchus (dialogue)|Hipparchus]]'' (not really by Plato, but probably of the fourth century BC) attributes it to [[Hipparchus (son of Pisistratus)|Hipparchus, son of Peisistratos (Athens)]].&lt;ref&gt;''Hipparchus'' 228b8. This, however, may be merely part of the historical romance of the Pisistratids: it is telling that [[Herodotus]] (7.6), who knew about Hipparchus' literary activities, knows nothing about this. The author of the ''Hipparchus'' makes (perhaps wilfully) all the mistakes about the family of [[Pisistratus]] which [[Thucydides]] notices in a well-known passage (6.54-59).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hipparchus'' adds that the law required the rhapsodists to follow on from one another in order, "as they still do". This recurs in a different form in the much later statement of [[Diogenes Laertius]] (1.2.57) that [[Solon]] made a law that the poems should be recited "with prompting". Many Athenian laws were falsely attributed to early lawgivers, but it is at least clear that by the fourth century the Homeric poems were a compulsory part of the Panathenaea, and were to be recited in order. They are too long for a single rhapsode or for a single day's performance. Therefore, they had to be divided into parts, and each rhapsode had to take his assigned part (otherwise they would have chosen favourite or prize passages).

Complementary evidence on oral performance of poetry in classical Greece comes in the form of references to a family, clan, or professional association of ''[[Homeridae]]'' (literally "children of Homer"). These certainly had an existence in the fifth and fourth centuries BC and certainly performed poems attributed to [[Homer]]. [[Pindar]] seems to count the Homeridae as rhapsodes;&lt;ref&gt;Pindar, ''Nemean Odes'' 2.1-5.&lt;/ref&gt; other sources do not specifically confirm this categorisation.

'''Roger''' is a fictional character in the [[adult animation|adult]] [[animated sitcom]] ''[[American Dad!]]'', voiced by [[Seth MacFarlane]]. The character was created and designed by Seth MacFarlane. Roger is a centuries-year-old [[grey alien|grey space alien]] living with [[List of American Dad! characters#Main characters|the Smith family]], around whom the show revolves. Having lived on Earth since crashing in [[Roswell, New Mexico]] in 1947, Roger came to live with the Smiths after rescuing main character [[Stan Smith (American Dad!)|Stan Smith]] at [[Area 51]] four years prior to the beginning of the series.&lt;ref name="ovguide1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ovguide.com/roger-9202a8c04000641f80000000008d8419 |title=Roger Video &amp;#124; Movie Clips &amp; Character Interview |publisher=Ovguide.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521175723/http://www.ovguide.com/roger-9202a8c04000641f80000000008d8419 |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McEwen |first=Lauren |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/therootdc/post/american-dad-one-of-the-most-sophisticated-mainstream-shows-on-african-american-culture/2012/10/08/e8374cba-051d-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_blog.html |title='American Dad': One of the most sophisticated mainstream shows on African American culture - The Root DC Live |publisher=The Washington Post |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger began the series as a sensitive pushover who is often taken advantage of, cheated, and ridiculed. Over time, the character has become a textbook [[psychopath]], exhibiting increasingly cruel, selfish, devious, and depraved behavior,&lt;ref name="ovguide1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avclub4"&gt;{{cite web|author=Todd VanDerWerff September 28, 2012 |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/comedy-showrunners-week-american-dads-cocreators-o,85507/ |title=Comedy Showrunners Week: American Dad's co-creators on the show's weird evolution &amp;#124; TV &amp;#124; Interview |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=2012-09-28 |accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the Smith family are curiously oblivious to his nature despite being his most frequent victims. In early episodes of the show, Roger is disallowed from leaving the Smith house in order to conceal his being an alien.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|author=AWN |url=http://www.awn.com/articles/people/iamerican-dadi-touchdown |title=American Dad Touchdown &amp;#124; AWN &amp;#124; |publisher=AWN |date=|accessdate=2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction is soon abandoned and Roger begins adopting disguises and fictitious personas in order to have a life outside the house.

Roger's personas have become a major [[plot device]], with his myriad alter egos frequently being the subject or facilitator of an episode's main story or [[subplot]]. This also helps to amplify his [[pansexuality]] and [[androgynous]] nature, which varies dependent on the plot situation and persona he has adopted. Aside from catalyzing the plot or subplot with his various personas, and despite his increasingly evident self-interest, he often serves to counsel the show's main characters, by humorously affirming or bluntly disregarding their opinions.

When voicing the character, MacFarlane speaks in a [[Swish (slang)|swish]] accent intended to resemble [[Paul Lynde]] (who played Uncle Arthur in ''[[Bewitched]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television/interviews/2007/seth_macfarlane_01.htm|title=A Chat with Seth MacFarlane|work=Bullz-eye.com|date=2007-05-21|accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Roger was voted "Gayest Cartoon Character of All Time" in a first-ever March Madness style competition held by [[Logo TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/08/roger-gayest-cartoon_n_5112731.html |title=Roger Of ‘American Dad’ Crowned LOGO’s ‘Gayest Cartoon Of All Time’ |last=Nichols |first=James |date=2014-04-08 |website=www.huffingtonpost.com |publisher=The Huffington Post |access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
Roger is selfish, cynical, and cruel but deeply sensitive. Having his feelings hurt usually spurs the creation of his egos and schemes. Roger typically displays a lighthearted, carefree temperament while at the same time engaging in his freakish grossness, outrageous malice, and rascally shenanigans.&lt;ref name="ovguide1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avclub4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="avclub3"&gt;{{cite web|last=McFarland |first=Kevin |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/naked-to-the-limit-one-more-time,92287/ |title="Naked To The Limit, One More Time" &amp;#124; American Dad &amp;#124; TV Club &amp;#124; TV |publisher=The A.V. Club |date=February 18, 2013 |accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crude and brazen, Roger has no qualms with randomly saying and doing whatever is on his mind, having little to no sympathy for anyone who might suffer as a result of his actions, and regularly misleading and finagling others to achieve his desired ends. However, according to the episode "[[American Dad! (season 4)#Episodes|Frannie 911]]", Roger is not this unpleasant by nature; his species of alien must let all unpleasantries out, for if they don't, it will turn into poison and kill them.

=== History ===
Also according to "Frannie 911", Roger has been on earth for over 60 years, having [[Roswell UFO incident|arrived in 1947]] as a result of being tricked,&lt;ref name="americandadscripts1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americandadscripts.com/S03E09_Frannie-911.php|title=American Dad Scripts|date=|publisher=American Dad Scripts|accessdate=2013-06-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104200526/http://www.americandadscripts.com/S03E09_Frannie-911.php|archivedate=2013-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to believe she was "The Decider" in whose hands the fate of mankind rested. Earlier, after causing his aunt’s spaceship to crash, Roger lived with a family of pioneer fur trappers that died travelling on the [[Oregon Trail]] in the episode OreTron Trail. There is also the possibility, he or another member of his race came to earth in early antiquity, as in the first episode of the 13th season a stone carving is shown depicting an alien looking like Roger squatting above a pyramid with two Egyptians presumably praising him and hieroglyph characters surrounding them. In the episode "[[American Dad! (season 9)|Naked to the Limit, One More Time]]" however, it is evidenced that Roger remains on Earth by will, the episode revealing that he can simply call for his aliens' spaceship to return him to his birth planet if he so desires.

Details on Roger's actual family and pre-Earth life have yet to be shown on the series. Although in the episode "[[Lost in Space (American Dad!)|Lost in Space]]", a brief clip revealed that prior to Roger's life on Earth, he was involved in a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] romantic relationship with another member of his alien race, Zing; however, Roger [[adultery|cheated]] on Zing, blatantly making out with a human male in front of him. It's also been revealed that Roger has lived on Earth for many years prior to his life spent with the Smith family.

Roger came into contact with the Smith family when he saved Stan's life back when Roger was a fugitive of [[Area 51]] (four years prior to the show's beginnings). Feeling he owed Roger a life debt because of this, Stan rescued him from government capture and allowed him to live in his home. Stan has allowed this in defiance of his employer, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Roger now covertly lives in the Smith home. Roger uses the Smith's attic as his hideout/room/bar.

=== Roger's disguises ===
After Stan took Roger in for saving his life, he felt that it would endanger him and the rest of his family if it were to be discovered that Roger is an alien and living with them. Consequently, Stan disallowed him from leaving the house when the series first began, even in disguise. Confined to the house in the first couple of seasons, Roger was miserable and malcontent.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; However, Roger is able to skillfully use disguises to exist in the outside world, which has become a major [[plot device]] in later episodes. Adding to this, he's created countless [[alter ego]]s to go along with them.&lt;ref name="avclub3" /&gt;

Roger has, however, abused this practice, leading numerous lives and outrageously deceiving numerous people. In fact, some of Roger's characters are in [[prison]], while others are widely despised, and others somehow have full-fledged human families and are even married; several of his characters somehow have birth children while others are graduates of [[Howard University]]. Roger also uses several of these personas to act in a criminal manner, as several of his alter egos have been seen to engage in robbery, sexual assault, police corruption, identity theft, drug trafficking, child abuse and with one persona even admitting to being wanted "for a series of prostitute murders".

Despite his numerous disguises consisting of only a different set of garment and hair with no effort to disguise his gray skin, [[non-human]] face and body features (with some exceptions, like additional body weight, facial hair or wrinkles), Roger has been capable of deceiving virtually every single person he interacts with without ever being discovered as an alien; not even by Stan's colleagues from [[CIA]], who according to him, have "an entire floor" looking for Roger. The Smith family is the only exception; however, for each member of the family there is one individual alter ego they can not recognize as Roger. On top of that, Roger has been sent to the hospital several times over the course of the series, and medical personnel, for some reason, have never found out that he's not a human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title="American Dad!"

==Potential film adaptation==
At [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con 2013]] on July 20, Mike Barker revealed that an ''American Dad!'' film centering on Roger and set on his birth planet may take place in the future. Barker did not announce any specifics as it relates to the nature and type of film he and the rest of the show's creators had in mind for the series; however, he strongly suggested that a film is where the show's staff and creators would like to take things. Barker further hinted that an ''American Dad!'' film may already be in the works and partially written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=' + data.results.personName + ' |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/comic-con-2013-american-dad-season-10-guest-stars-include-zooey-deschanel-alison-brie-and-mariah-car.html |title=Comic-Con 2013: 'American Dad' Season 10 guest stars include Zooey Deschanel, Alison Brie and Mariah Carey - Zap2it |publisher=Blog.zap2it.com |date=2013-07-20 |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130822112804/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/07/comic-con-2013-american-dad-season-10-guest-stars-include-zooey-deschanel-alison-brie-and-mariah-car.html |archivedate=2013-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Historie und Leben der berühmtesten europäischen Mahler frontispiece 1710.jpg|thumb|
Roger de Piles, [[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] to ''History and life of the famous European Painters'', Hamburg, Benj. Schiller, 1710]]
'''Roger de Piles''' (7 October 1635 – 5 April 1709) was a French painter, engraver, art critic and diplomat.

==Life==
Born in [[Clamecy, Nievre|Clamecy]], Roger de Piles studied philosophy and theology, and devoted himself to painting.

In 1662 he became tutor to [[Michel Amelot de Gournay]],  whom he was to follow throughout his life, acting as secretary to his various missions as French ambassador to Venice, Portugal, Spain.

In [[Venice]] (1682–1685) he started a famous collection of prints, drawings and paintings of [[Giorgione]], [[Correggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Antoine Coypel]], [[Jean-Baptiste Forest]].

He also acquired a taste for political intrigue using his travels ostensibly undertaken to study the European collections, as a buyer for [[Louis XIV]], as  cover for confidential missions - for example in Germany and Austria (1685) on behalf of Louis' minister, the [[marquis de Louvois]].

He was not always fortunate as a spy. In 1692, during the [[War of the League of Augsburg]], he was arrested in [[the Hague]] carrying a false passport and imprisoned for the next five years. He spent his time writing ''L'Abrégé de la vie des peintres ...avec un traité du peintre parfait''.&lt;ref&gt;"Epitome of the life of the painters... with a treaty on the perfect painter".&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1699 following his appointement as Conseiller Honoraire to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]].

In 1705 he followed Amelot de Gournay to Spain but illness forced him to return to Paris, where he died in 1709.

==Art critic==
His important contribution to [[Aesthetics|aesthetic theory]] rests on his ''Dialogue sur le coloris'' ("Dialogue on colours"), in which he initiated his famous defence of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] in the argument started in 1671 by [[Philippe de Champaigne]] on the relative merits of [[drawing]] and [[color]] in the work of [[Titian]] (in a lecture to the [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]] on Titian's ''Virgin and Child with St John''.)

The argument is most fascinating as an early debate on classic vs modern in painting; in essence on the mathematics of [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]] and [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in [[drawing]]&amp;mdash;the classic approach&amp;mdash; as opposed to the colored [[brush]] stroke&amp;mdash;the approach of the moderns. In his detailed study of the argument, ''Roger de Piles et les débats sur le coloris au siècle de Louis XIV'' (1965), B. Teyssèdre gives a touching account of the ''bohème'' of the "modern" ''réfusés'' in seventeenth century Paris, a history that was to repeat itself with the [[Impressionists]].

In the course of the argument Roger de Piles introduced the term  "''clair-obscur''" ([[Chiaroscuro]]) to highlight the effect of color in accentuating the tension between light and dark in a painting.

The way Roger de Piles documented his argument with Venetian and northern European examples was of influence to [[Antoine Coypel]], [[Hyacinthe Rigaud]], [[Nicolas de Largillière]] and [[François de Troy]].

==Balance of painters==
To his last published work: ''Cours de peinture par principes avec un balance de peintres'' (1708) de Piles appended a list of fifty-six major painters with whose work he had acquainted himself as a connoisseur during his travels.

To each painter in the list he gave marks from 0 to 18 for composition, drawing, color and expression. This gave an overview of aesthetic appreciation hinging on the balance between color and design. The highest marks went to [[Raffaello Sanzio]] and [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], with a slight bias on color for Rubens, a slight bias on drawing for Raphaël. Painters who scored very badly in anything but color were [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]] and remarkably [[Michelangelo Caravaggio]] with 16 on color and 0 (zero) on expression. Painters who fell far behind Rubens and Raphaël but whose balance between color and design was perfect were [[Lucas van Leyden]], [[Sebastian Bourdon]], [[Albrecht Dürer]].

==List==

The complete list is transcribed here from Manlio Brusatin:''Histoire des couleurs'' (Paris: Flammarion, 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–104), reproduced in Elisabeth G. Holt ''Literary Sources of Art History'', (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1947), pp.&amp;nbsp;415–416

'''''Santa Cristina al Tiverone Altarpiece'''''  is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Lorenzo Lotto]], executed around 1504-1506. It is still housed in its original location, the parish church of Santa Cristina in Quinto di Treviso, a ''[[frazione]]'' of [[Treviso]], northern [[Italy]]. 

Measuring 90x179&amp;nbsp;cm ([[lunette]]) and 177x162&amp;nbsp;cm (central panel), it is signed "Laurentius / Lotus / P.[inxit]" at the base of the throne. It was perhaps commissioned around 1505 by bishop [[Bernardo de' Rossi]], in whose court Lotto worked at the time. It was released on 14 May 1507, just before the artists' move to [[Recanati]].

==Description==
The main panel, of rectangular shape, shows a [[sacred conversation]] with ''Madonna and Child'' sitting on a large throne. Around her are the saints Peter, Christine, Liberalis and Jerome, all enclosed within a classical style architecture. 

The composition derives from [[Giovanni Bellini]]'s [[San Zaccaria Altarpiece]], as testified by the niche in the throne with Byzantine mosaics, and the oriental carpet at Mary's feet. Perhaps inspired by [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[Castelfranco Madonna]]'' is the figure of Liberalis, the patron saint of Treviso, as a knight holding a model of the city in a hand.

The baby Jesus holds a [[Carduelis|goldfinch]], an allegory of his future Passion. The right side opens on an external wall covered by grass. 

The lunette shows instead a ''[[Pietà]]'', also based on Bellini, with the dead Christ supported by two angels.

'''Simon-Charles Miger''' ([[Nemours]], 19 February 1736 – [[Paris]], 28 February 1828) was a French engraver, most notable for the plates he produced for ''La Ménagerie du Muséum national d'histoire naturelle'' by [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède|Lacépède]], [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire|Saint-Hilaire]] and [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]].

==Life and work==
Son of a tanner who sent him to study in Paris, Miger took various jobs including teacher, tutor and secretary before discovering a passion for engraving. He apprenticed to [[Charles Nicolas Cochin]], which employed him as a clerk, and attended the workshop of [[Johann Georg Wille]]. He developed into a portraitist, and then fell in love with a woman with whom he courted for four years until his situation finally allow her to marry him. In 1778, Miger was accredited by the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]], where he was admitted as a member in 1781. During the [[French Revolution]], he argued alongside [[Jean-Michel Moreau]] and [[Adélaïde Labille-Guiard]] for the renovation of the statutes that were falling into disrepair. "The laws of the state, he says, are granted by the French people, those of the Academy shall be through all académicien people." But these reform proposals were rendered obsolete by the abolition of Academies, decreed by the [[National Convention]] in 1795. In 1800, Miger is charged with [[Bernard Germain de Lacépède]] to engrave the planks of his work on the menagerie of the [[National Museum of Natural History]]. He then continues to handle the chisel and compose verses until the age of nearly 90 years.

'''''Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette''''' ({{lang-nl|Kop van een skelet met brandende sigaret}}) is an early work by [[Vincent van Gogh]].  The small and undated oil-on-canvas painting featuring a skeleton and [[cigarette]] is part of the permanent collection of the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref name="vgmnl"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1628&amp;collection=619&amp;lang=en | title= Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette, 1886 | publisher= [[Van Gogh Museum]] | accessdate= 2013-05-19 | quote= This curious and somewhat macabre little painting is undated. It was probably executed in the winter of 1885&amp;ndash;86, during Van Gogh’s stay in Antwerp....This skull with a cigarette was likely meant as a kind of joke, and probably also as a comment on conservative academic practice. | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120203071542/http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=1628&amp;collection=619&amp;lang=en | archivedate= February 3, 2012 | df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt;  It was probably painted in the winter of 1885&amp;ndash;86 as a humorous comment on conservative academic practices&lt;ref name="vgmnl"/&gt; – before painting live human models, the academic routine would have included studies of skeletons, to develop an understanding of human anatomy – an assumption based on the fact that Van Gogh was in Antwerp at that time, attending classes at the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]], classes he would later say were boring and taught him nothing.&lt;ref name="Bundrick"/&gt;  

Van Gogh included skeletons in another work from his Antwerp period, a sketch of a "Hanging skeleton and cat".&lt;ref name="vanGogh"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pubhist.com/w13456 |title="Hanging skeleton and cat"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1887–88, van Gogh painted two more paintings with skulls, the only other works of his (besides a drawing from the same period) to use skulls as a [[motif (visual arts)|motif]].&lt;ref name="Bundrick"/&gt;

The work measures {{convert|32|x|24.5|cm}}.  It is considered a [[vanitas]] or [[memento mori]], at a time when Van Gogh himself was in poor health.  It may be influenced by works of [[Hercules Segers]], a 17th-century Dutch artist, or of [[Félicien Rops]], a Belgian contemporary of Van Gogh.  Although often interpreted as a criticism of smoking, Van Gogh was a keen smoker himself, and continued to smoke until his death in 1890.&lt;ref name="Bundrick"/&gt;

In 2008, the painting was used by graphic designer [[Chip Kidd]] on the [[first edition]] cover for ''[[When You Are Engulfed in Flames]]'', a collection of essays written by [[David Sedaris]].  Sedaris is said to have been "fascinated with the image" after seeing it on a postcard during a trip to Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="Bundrick"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://vangoghschair.blogspot.com/2008/06/memento-mori-or-just-joke.html | title= Memento Mori or Just a Joke? | first= Sheramy | last= Bundrick | work= Van Gogh's Chair (blog)| date= June 14, 2008| publisher= [[blogspot.com]] |accessdate=2013-05-19| quote= [H]is letters and anecdotes from others record that he sparred with his drawing and painting teachers and was scornful of conservative academic practice. His time at the Academy lasted only weeks; he felt he was learning nothing and later proclaimed academic training "damned boring". Taken from that perspective, 'Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette' could be read as a thumbing-of-the-nose at 'the establishment.' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was held by Van Gogh's brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo Van Gogh]] at the time of his death in 1891.  It was inherited by his widow [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]] until her death in 1925, and then by their son [[Vincent Willem van Gogh (born 1890)|Vincent Willem van Gogh]] until 1962, when it was acquired by the [[Van Gogh Foundation]].  It was on loan to the [[Stedelijk Museum]] from 1962 to 1973, and has been on permanent loan to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vggallery.com/painting/p_0212.htm Skull with Burning Cigarette], vggallery.com&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a professor at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the [[University of Ljubljana]]  and international director of the [[Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities]] of the [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbk.ac.uk/bih/aboutus/staff/zizek|title=Slavoj Zizek - International Director — The Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities, Birkbeck, University of London|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He works in subjects including [[continental philosophy]], [[political theory]], [[cultural studies]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[film criticism]], [[Marxism]], [[Hegelianism]] and [[theology]].

In 1989, Žižek published his first English text, ''[[The Sublime Object of Ideology]]'', in which he departed from traditional [[Marxist]] theory to develop a [[materialist]] conception of [[ideology]] that drew heavily on [[Lacanian psychoanalysis]] and [[Hegelian idealism]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Slavoj-Zizek|title=Slavoj Zizek - Slovene philosopher and cultural theorist|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;"Slavoj Žižek," by Matthew Sharpe, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, {{ISSN|2161-0002}}, http://www.iep.utm.edu/zizek/. 27 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His early theoretical work became increasingly eclectic and political in the 1990s, dealing frequently in the critical analysis of disparate forms of popular culture and making him a popular figure of the academic [[leftism|left]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirk Boyle.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Žižek was born in [[Ljubljana]], [[SR Slovenia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], into a middle-class family.&lt;ref name="mladina.si"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200442/clanek/nar-kdo_je_kdaj--ursa_matos/ |trans-title=Who's When: Slavoj Žižek.

His mother Vesna, native of the [[Gorizia Hills]] in the [[Slovenian Littoral]], was an accountant in a state enterprise. His parents were [[Atheism|atheists]].&lt;ref name="mladina.si"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Slovenski biografski leksikon'' (Ljubljana: [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts|SAZU]], 1991), XV. edition&lt;/ref&gt; He spent most of his childhood in the coastal town of [[Portorož]], where he was exposed to Western film, theory and popular culture.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name=slovenskapomlad&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/2?id=20 |title=Slovenska pomlad: Slavoj Žižek (Webpage run by the National Museum of Modern History in Ljubljana) |publisher=Slovenskapomlad.si |date=29 September 1988 |accessdate=4 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180230/http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/2?id=20 |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Slavoj was a teenager his family moved back to Ljubljana where he attended [[Bežigrad High School]].&lt;ref name=slovenskapomlad/&gt; In the 1960s and early 1970s, Slavoj encountered western philosophy in [[Zagreb]]. {{Citation needed|reason=cba to source it, goes into this here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqmOkBK7lFA|date=April 2017}}

===Education===
In 1967, during an era of [[liberalization]] in [[Titoism|Titoist]] Yugoslavia, Žižek enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]] and studied philosophy and sociology.&lt;ref name="lacan.com"&gt;Tony Meyers [http://www.lacan.com/zizekchro1.htm Slavoj Zizek - His Life] lacan.com, from: Slavoj Zizek, London: Routledge, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had already begun reading French [[Structuralism|structuralists]] prior to entering university, and in 1967 he published the first translation of a text by [[Jacques Derrida]] into Slovenian.&lt;ref name="mladina.si 42"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200442/clanek/nar-kdo_je_kdaj--ursa_matos/ |title= Tednik, številka 42, Slavoj Žižek |publisher= Mladina.Si |date= 24 October 2004 |accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mladina.si 42"/&gt; 
An early influence at university, [[Božidar Debenjak]], taught the philosophy of [[German idealism]] and introduced the thought of the [[Frankfurt School]] to Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://dpu.mirovni-institut.si/9letnik/debenjak.php |title= Delavsko-punkerska univerza |publisher= Dpu.mirovni-institut.si |date= 22 February 1999 |accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debenjak's reading of Marx's ''[[Das Kapital]]'' from the perspective of Hegel's '' [[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' influenced many future Slovenian philosophers, including Žižek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mladina.si/tednik/200904/dr__bozidar_debenjak__filozof |title= Tednik, številka 04, Dr. Božidar Debenjak, filozof |publisher= Mladina.Si |date= 6 February 2009 |accessdate= 13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Žižek frequented the circles of dissident intellectuals, including the [[Martin Heidegger|Heideggerian]] philosophers [[Tine Hribar]] and [[Ivo Urbančič]],&lt;ref name="mladina.si 42"/&gt; and published articles in alternative magazines, such as ''[[Praxis School|Praxis]]'', ''Tribuna'' and ''Problemi'', which he also edited.&lt;ref name=slovenskapomlad/&gt; In 1971 he accepted a job as an assistant researcher with the promise of tenure, but was dismissed after his Master's thesis was denounced by the authorities of being "non-Marxist".&lt;ref name="p37"&gt;Žižek's response to the article "Če sem v kaj resnično zaljubljena, sem v življenje Sobotna priloga Dela, p. 37 (19.1. 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the University of Ljubljana in 1981 with a [[Doctor of Arts]] in Philosophy for his dissertation entitled ''The Theoretical and Practical Relevance of French Structuralism''.&lt;ref name="lacan.com"/&gt;

He spent the next few years undertaking [[national service]] in the [[Yugoslav army]] in [[Karlovac]].&lt;ref name="lacan.com"/&gt;

===Career===
During the 1980s, Žižek edited and translated [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Louis Althusser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dskp-drustvo.si/prevajalci.php |title=Prevajalci&amp;nbsp;– Društvo slovenskih književnih prevajalcev |publisher=Dskp-drustvo.si |accessdate=7 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105042135/http://www.dskp-drustvo.si/prevajalci.php |archivedate=5 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He used Jacques Lacan's work to interpret [[Hegelianism|Hegelian]] and Marxist philosophy.

In 1985, Žižek completed a second doctorate ([[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[psychoanalysis]]) at the [[University of Paris VIII]]&lt;ref name="lacan.com"/&gt; under [[Jacques-Alain Miller]] and [[François Regnault]].

He wrote the introduction to Slovene translations of [[G. K. Chesterton]]'s and [[John Le Carré]]'s detective novels.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} 
In 1988, he published his first book dedicated entirely to [[film theory]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} He achieved international recognition as a [[Social theory|social theorist]] with the 1989 publication of his first book in English, ''The Sublime Object of Ideology''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Žižek has been publishing in journals such as ''[[Lacanian Ink]]'' and ''[[In These Times]]'' in the United States, the ''[[New Left Review]]'' and ''[[The London Review of Books]]'' in the United Kingdom, and with the Slovenian [[Social liberalism|left-liberal]] magazine ''[[Mladina]]'' and newspapers ''[[Dnevnik (Ljubljana)|Dnevnik]]'' and ''[[Delo]]''. He also cooperates with the Polish leftist magazine ''[[Krytyka Polityczna]]'', regional southeast European left-wing journal ''[[Novi Plamen]]'', and serves on the editorial board of the psychoanalytical journal ''Problemi''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Žižek is a series editor of the [[Northwestern University Press]] series Diaeresis that publishes works that "deal not only with philosophy, but also will intervene at the levels of ideology critique, politics, and art theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diaeresis series page|url=http://www.nupress.northwestern.edu/content/diaeresis|website=Northwestern University Press|publisher=Northwestern University Press|accessdate=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
In the late 1980s, Žižek came to public attention as a columnist for the alternative youth magazine ''[[Mladina]]'', which was critical of Tito's policies, Yugoslav politics, especially the [[militarization]] of society. He was a member of the [[Communist Party of Slovenia]] until October 1988, when he quit in protest against the [[JBTZ trial]] together with 32 other Slovenian intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=103 |title=Skupinski protestni izstop iz ZKS |date=28 October 1998 |publisher=Slovenska Pomlad |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180147/http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=103 |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1988 and 1990, he was actively involved in several political and [[civil society]] movements which fought for the [[democratization]] of Slovenia, most notably the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=31&amp;aofs=3 |title=Odbor za varstvo človekovih pravic |date=3 June 1998 |publisher=Slovenska Pomlad |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003180306/http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=31&amp;aofs=3 |archivedate=3 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Slovenian presidential election, 1990|first free elections]] in 1990, he ran as the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democratic Party]]'s candidate for Slovenian presidency (an office formally abolished in the [[Constitution of Slovenia|1991 constitution]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Despite his activity in liberal democratic projects, Žižek has remained committed to the communist ideal and has been critical of right-wing circles, such as nationalists, [[Conservatism|conservatives]], and [[Classical liberalism|classical liberals]] both in Slovenia and worldwide. He wrote that the [[Cankar Hall|convention center]] in which nationalist [[Slovene writers]] hold their conventions should be blown up, adding, "Since we live in the time without any sense of irony, I must add I don't mean it literally."&lt;ref name="Interview_part_two"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/6FZv9WUfX?url=http://www.delo.si/zgodbe/sobotnapriloga/slavoj-zizek-bog-daj-da-bi-ciniki-na-oblasti-res-vedeli-kaj-pocnejo.html Interview] with Žižek – part two, [[Delo]], 2 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, he jokingly made the following comment in May 2013, during [[Subversive Festival]]: "If they don't support [[SYRIZA]], then, in my vision of the democratic future, all these people will get from me [is] a first-class one-way ticket to [a] [[gulag]]."

In 2003, Žižek wrote text to accompany [[Bruce Weber (photographer)|Bruce Weber]]'s photographs in a catalog for [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]]. Questioned as to the seemliness of a major intellectual writing ad copy, Žižek told ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', "If I were asked to choose between doing things like this to earn money and becoming fully employed as an American academic, kissing ass to get a tenured post, I would with pleasure choose writing for such journals!"&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Joshua.

Žižek and his thought have been the subject of several documentaries. The 1996 ''[[Liebe Dein Symptom wie Dich selbst!]]'' is a German documentary on him. In the 2004 ''[[The Reality of the Virtual]]'', Žižek gave a one-hour lecture on his interpretation of Lacan's tripartite thesis of the imaginary, the symbolic, and the real.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} ''[[Zizek!]]'' is a 2005 documentary by [[Astra Taylor]] on his philosophy.

# Against [[Karl Marx]]'s concept of ideology as described in ''[[The German Ideology]]'', [[false consciousness]] prevents people from seeing how things really are. Building upon Althusser, ideology is thoroughly unconscious and functions as a series of justifications and [[Spontaneous order|spontaneous]] socio-symbolic rituals which support virtual authorities.
# [[The Real]] is not experienced as something which is ordered in a way that gives satisfactory meaning to all its parts in relation to one another. Instead the Real is experienced as through the lens of hegemonic systems of representation and reproduction, while resisting full inscription into ordering system ascribed to it. This in turn may lead subjects to experience the Real as generating political resistance.

Drawing on Lacan's notion of the barred subject, the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] is a purely negative [[entity]], a void of negativity (in the Hegelian sense), which allows for the flexibility and reflexivity of the Cartesian [[Cogito ergo sum|cogito]] (transcendental subject).&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinnerbrink2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinnerbrink|first=Robert|title=The Hegelian 'Night of the World': Žižek on Subjectivity, Negativity, and Universality|journal=International Journal of Žižek Studies|year=2008|volume=2|issue=2|url=http://zizekstudies.org/index.php/ijzs/article/view/136|accessdate=17 August 2012|issn=1751-8229|quote=This extraordinary analysis of the transcendental imagination, critique of Heidegger, and rereading of Hegelian 'night of the world,' together contribute to a reassertion of the radicality of the 'Cartesian subject'—that thoroughly repudiated theoretical spectre which nonetheless continues to 'haunt Western academia' (1999: 1–5). This unorthodox reading of the Hegelian 'night of the world'—the radical negativity that haunts subjectivity—is developed further in an explicitly political direction, which helps explain a critique of the 'Fukuyamaian' consensus, shared both by moral-religious conservatives and libertarian 'postmodernists', that global capitalism remains the 'unsurpassable horizon of our times'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though consciousness is opaque (following Hegel), the epistemological gap between the In-itself and For-itself is immanent to reality itself;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Umbr(a): The Object|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k7QbBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Umbr(a) Journal|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9780979953965|first = Tom|last = Eyers|first2 = Graham|last2 = Harman|first3 = Adrian|last3 = Johnston|first4 = Guy Le|last4 = Gaufey|first5 = Todd|last5 = McGowan|first6 = Duane|last6 = Rousselle|first7 = Jelica Šumič|last7 = Riha|first8 = Rado|last8 = Riha}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kant's antinomies|antinomies]] of Kant, [[quantum physics]], and [[Alain Badiou]]'s 'materialist' principle that 'The One is Not', point towards an inconsistent ("Barred") Real itself (that Lacan conceptualized prior).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FAqM5rxWWKwC|publisher = Verso Books|date = 2012-05-22|isbn = 9781844679027|first = Slavoj|last = Zizek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are multiple Symbolic interpretations of the Real, they are not all relatively "true". Two instances of the Real can be identified: the abject Real (or "real Real"), which cannot be wholly integrated into the symbolic order, and the symbolic Real, a set of signifiers that can never be properly integrated into the horizon of sense of a subject. The truth is revealed in the process of transiting the contradictions; or the real is a "minimal difference", the gap between the infinite judgement of a [[reductionism|reductionist]] materialism and experience as lived,&lt;ref&gt;Zizek, On Belief&lt;/ref&gt; the "Parallax" of dialectical antagonisms are inherent to reality itself and [[dialectical materialism]] (contra [[Friedrich Engels]]) is a new materialist Hegelianism, incorporating the insights of Lacanian psychoanalysis, set theory, quantum physics, and contemporary continental philosophy.

===Political thought and the postmodern subject===
Žižek argues:
* The state is a system of regulatory institutions that shape our behavior. Its power is purely symbolic and has no normative force outside of collective behavior. In this way, the term ''the law'' signifies society's basic principles, which enable interaction by prohibiting certain acts.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, ''For They Know Not What They Do''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Political decisions have become depoliticized and accepted as natural conclusions. For example, controversial policy decisions (such as reductions in social welfare spending) are presented as apparently "objective" necessities. Although governments make claims about increased citizen participation and democracy, the important decisions are still made in the interests of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. The [[two-party system]] dominant in the United States and elsewhere produces a similar illusion.&lt;ref&gt;''A Plea for Intolerance''&lt;/ref&gt; It is still necessary to engage in [[Political particularism|particular]] conflicts – such as labor disputes – but the trick is to relate these individual events to the larger struggle. Particular demands, if executed well, might serve as ''metaphorical condensation'' for the system and its injustices. The real political conflict is between an ordered structure of society and those without a place in it.&lt;ref name="Ticklish Subject&amp;nbsp;— Politics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|title=The Ticklish Subject: the absent centre of political ontology|year=1999|publisher=Verso|location=London|isbn=9781859848944|chapter=Political Subjectivization and Its Vicissitudes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In stark contrast to the intellectual tenets of the European "universalist Left" in general, and those [[Jürgen Habermas]] defined as postnational in particular, pro-sovereignty and pro-independence processes opened in Europe are good.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dropbox.com/s/cihuwrieedr8s1j/44101916-LAPIKO-TXOSTENAK-ZIZEK.pdf Žižek: "The force of universalism is in you Basques, not in the Spanish state", Interview in ''ARGIA'' (27 June 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] subject is cynical toward official institutions, yet at the same time believes in conspiracies. When we lost our shared belief in a single power, we constructed another of the [[Big Other|Other]] in order to escape the unbearable freedom that we faced.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, ''Looking Awry: an Introduction to Jacques Lacan through Popular Culture''&lt;/ref&gt; It is not enough to merely know that you are being lied to, particularly when continuing to live a normal life under capitalism. For example, that despite people being aware of ideology, they may continue to act as automata, mistakenly believing that they are thereby expressing their radical freedom. Although one may possess a self-awareness, just because one understands what one is doing does not mean that one is doing the right thing.&lt;ref name=YouMay1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|title=You May!|journal=London Review of Books|date=18 March 1999|volume=21|issue=6|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n06/slavoj-zizek/you-may|accessdate=20 August 2012|quote=But the notion is undermined by the rise of what might be called 'Post-Modern racism', the surprising characteristic of which is its insensitivity to reflection&amp;nbsp;– a neo-Nazi skinhead who beats up black people knows what he's doing, but does it anyway.

* Religion is not an enemy but rather one of the fields of struggle. [[Atheism]] is good. Religious fundamentalists are in a way no different from "godless Stalinist Communists". They both value divine will and salvation over moral or ethical action.&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, Slavoj.

==Criticism==
There are two main themes of critique of Žižek's ideas: his failure to articulate an alternative or program in the face of his denunciation of contemporary social, political, and economic arrangements, and his lack of rigor in argumentation.&lt;ref name="ViolentVisions"/&gt;

===Ambiguity and unclear alternatives===
Žižek's philosophical and political positions are not always clear, and his work has been criticized for a failure to take a consistent stance.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Gabriel (2011). [http://www.alpineanarchist.org/r_anarchist_hypothesis.html The Anarchist Hypothesis, or Badiou, Žižek, and the Anti-Anarchist Prejudice] Alpine Anarchist. Retrieved 4 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While he has claimed to stand by a revolutionary Marxist project,  his lack of vision concerning the possible circumstances which could lead to successful revolution makes it unclear what that project consists of. According to John Gray and John Holbo, his theoretical argument often lacks grounding in historical fact, which makes him more provocative than insightful.&lt;ref name="ViolentVisions"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=John|title=The Violent Visions of Slavoj Žižek|journal=New York Review of Books|date=12 July 2012|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/jul/12/violent-visions-slavoj-zizek/|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holbo-2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holbo|first=John|title=On Žižek and Trilling|journal=Philosophy and Literature|date=1 January 2004|volume=28|issue=2|pages=430–440|doi=10.1353/phl.2004.0029|quote=...an unhealthy anti-liberal is one, like Z+iz=ek, who ticks and tocks in unreflective revulsion at liberalism, pantomiming that he is de Maistre (or Abraham) or Robespierre (or Lenin) by turns, lest he look like Mill.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Holbo-CT-2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Holbo|first=John|title=Zizek on the Financial Collapse&amp;nbsp;– and Liberalism|url=http://crookedtimber.org/2010/12/17/zizek-on-the-financial-collapse-and-liberalism/|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=Crooked Timbers|date=17 December 2010|quote=To review: Zizek does this liberal = neoliberal thing.

[[Roger Scruton]] has written in "Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left", "To summarize Žižek's position is not easy: he slips between philosophical and psychoanalytical ways of arguing, and is spell-bound by [[Lacan]]'s gnomic utterances. He is a lover of paradox, and believes strongly in what [[Hegel]] called 'the labour of the negative' though taking the idea, as always, one stage further towards the brick wall of paradox".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scruton |first=Roger |date=2015 |title=Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left |publisher=Bloomsbury |page=256 |isbn=1408187337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Žižek's refusal to present an alternative vision has led critics to accuse him of using unsustainable Marxist categories of analysis and having a 19th-century understanding of class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavoj Zizek responds to his critics|last=Žižek|first=Slavoj|work=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=July 3, 2012|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2012/07/slavoj-zizek-responds-to-his-critics/|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Ernesto Laclau]] argued that "Žižek uses class as a sort of ''[[deus ex machina]]'' to play the role of the good guy against the multicultural devils."&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Judith, Ernesto Laclau and Slavoj Žižek ''Contingency, Hegemony, Universality: Contemporary Dialogues on the Left''. Verso. London, New York City 2000. pp. 202–206&lt;/ref&gt; The use of such analysis, however, is not systematic and draws on critical accounts of [[Stalinism]] and [[Maoism]], as well as [[post-structuralism]] and Lacanian [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name=VanAuken&amp;Haig-2010&gt;{{cite news|title=Zizek in Manhattan: An intellectual charlatan masquerading as "left"|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2010/nov2010/zize-n12.shtml|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=World Socialist Web Site|date=12 November 2010|author=Bill Van Auken|author2=Adam Haig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Žižek does not agree with critics who claim he believes in a historical necessity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no such thing as the Communist [[big Other]], there's no historical necessity or [[teleology]] directing and guiding our actions. (In [[Slovene language|Slovene]]: "''Ni komunističnega velikega Drugega, nobene zgodovinske nujnosti ali teleologije, ki bi usmerjala in vodila naša dejanja''".)&lt;ref name="Interview_part_two"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his book ''Living in the End Times'', Žižek suggests that the criticism of his positions is itself ambiguous and multilateral: &lt;blockquote&gt;[...] I am attacked for being anti-Semitic ''and'' for spreading [[Zionism|Zionist]] lies, for being a covert Slovene nationalist ''and'' unpatriotic traitor to my nation, for being a crypto-Stalinist defending terror ''and'' for spreading Bourgeois lies about Communism... so maybe, just maybe I am on right path, the path of fidelity to freedom."&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek. "Living in the End Times".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Unorthodox style and scholarship===
Critics complain of a theoretical chaos in which questions and answers are confused and in which Žižek constantly recycles old ideas which were scientifically refuted long ago or which in reality have quite a different meaning than Žižek gives to them.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. David Bordwell, "Slavoj Žižek: Say Anything", DavidBordwell.net blog, April 2005.[http://www.davidbordwell.net/essays/zizek.php]; Philipp Oehmke, "Welcome to the Slavoj Zizek Show". ''Der Spiegel Online (International edition)'', 7 August 2010 [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-most-dangerous-philosopher-in-the-west-welcome-to-the-slavoj-zizek-show-a-705164.html]; [[Jonathan Rée]], "Less Than Nothing by Slavoj Žižek&amp;nbsp;– review. A march through Slavoj Žižek's 'masterwork'". ''The Guardian'', 27 June 2012.[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jun/27/less-than-nothing-slavoj-zizek-review]&lt;/ref&gt; Harpham calls Žižek's style "a stream of nonconsecutive units arranged in arbitrary sequences that solicit a sporadic and discontinuous attention."&lt;ref&gt;Harpham [http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v29/v29n3.harpham1.html "Doing the Impossible: Slavoj Žižek and the End of Knowledge"]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neill concurs: "a dizzying array of wildly entertaining and often quite maddening rhetorical strategies are deployed in order to beguile, browbeat, dumbfound, dazzle, confuse, mislead, overwhelm, and generally subdue the reader into acceptance."&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, [http://www.film-philosophy.com/vol5-2001/n17oneill "The Last Analysis of Slavoj Žižek"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such presentation has laid him open to accusations of misreading other philosophers, particularly [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Žižek carries over many concepts from Lacan's teachings into the sphere of political and social theory, but has a tendency to do so in an extreme deviation from its psychoanalytic context.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Parker, ''Slavoj Žižek: A Critical Introduction'' (Pluto Press: London and Sterling, 2004) p.78-80. For example, Žižek's appropriation of Lacan's discussion of [[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]] in his 1959/1960 seminar, ''The Ethics of Psychoanalysis''. In this seminar, Lacan uses Antigone to defend the claim that "the only thing of which one can be guilty is of having given ground relative to one's desire" (Slavoj Žižek, ''The Metastases of Enjoyment'', Verso: London, 1994; p.&amp;nbsp;69). However, as Parker notes, Antigone's act (burying her dead brother in the knowledge that she will be buried alive) was never intended to effect a revolutionary change in the political status quo; yet, despite this, Žižek frequently cites Antigone as a paradigm of ethico-political action.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, according to some critics, Žižek's conflation of Lacan's unconscious with Hegel's unconscious is mistaken. Noah Horwitz, in an effort to dissociate Lacan from Hegel, interprets the Lacanian unconscious and the Hegelian unconscious as two totally different mechanisms. Horwitz points out, in Lacan and Hegel's differing approaches to the topic of speech, that Lacan's unconscious reveals itself to us in [[parapraxis]], or "slips-of-the-tongue". We are therefore, according to Lacan, alienated from language through the revelation of our desire (even if that desire originated with the Other, as he claims, it remains peculiar to us). In Hegel's unconscious, however, we are alienated from language whenever we attempt to articulate a particular and end up articulating a universal. For example, if I say 'the dog is with me', although I am trying to say something about this particular dog at this particular time, I actually produce the universal category 'dog', and therefore express a generality, not the particularity I desire. Hegel's argument implies that, at the level of sense-certainty, we can never express the true nature of reality. Lacan's argument implies, to the contrary, that speech reveals the true structure of a particular unconscious mind.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Horwitz, "Contra the Slovenians: Returning to Lacan and away from Hegel" (''Philosophy Today'', Spring 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;24–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a very negative review of Žižek's magnum opus ''Less than Nothing'', the British political philosopher [[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] attacked Žižek for his celebrations of violence, his failure to ground his theories in historical facts, and his ‘formless radicalism’ which, according to Gray, professes to be communist yet lacks the conviction that communism could ever be successfully realized. Gray concluded that Žižek's work, though entertaining, is intellectually worthless: 'Achieving a deceptive substance by endlessly reiterating an essentially empty vision, Žižek's work amounts in the end to less than nothing.'&lt;ref name="ViolentVisions"/&gt;

===Accusations of self-plagiarism in 2014===
Žižek's tendency to recycle portions of his own texts in subsequent works resulted in the accusation of [[self-plagiarism]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2014, after Žižek published 
an op-ed in the magazine which contained portions of his writing from an earlier book.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/slavoj-zizek-self-plagiarized-new-york-times-269221|title=Slavoj Žižek On 'Self Plagiarism' in The New York Times: What's the Big Deal?|date=10 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Žižek expressed perplexity at the harsh tone of the denunciation, emphasizing that the recycled passages in question only acted as references from his theoretical books to supplement otherwise original writing.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"/&gt;

On 11 July 2014, American weekly newsmagazine ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that in an article published in 2006 Žižek plagiarized substantial passages from an earlier review that first appeared in the journal ''[[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]]'', a publication condemned by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as the organ of a "white nationalist hate group."&lt;ref name="American_Renaissance_Plagiarism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/did-marxist-philosophy-superstar-slavoj-zizek-plagiarize-white-nationalist-journal-258433 |title= Did Marxist Philosophy Superstar Slavoj Žižek Plagiarize a White Nationalist Journal?|work= Newsweek |date=11 July 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in response to the allegations, Žižek stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When I was writing the text on Derrida which contains the problematic passages, a friend told me about [[Kevin B. MacDonald|Kevin Macdonald's]]  theories, and I asked him to send me a brief resume. The friend send [sic] it to me, assuring me that I can use it freely since it merely resumes another's line of thought. Consequently, I did just that – and I sincerely apologize for not knowing that my friend's resume was largely borrowed from Stanley Hornbeck's review of Macdonald's book. [...] As any reader can quickly establish, the problematic passages are purely informative, a report on another's theory for which I have no affinity whatsoever; all I do after this brief resume is quickly dismissing Macdonald's theory as a new chapter in the long process of the destruction of Reason. In no way can I thus be accused of plagiarizing another's line of thought, of "stealing ideas". I nonetheless deeply regret the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=Michelle|title=Slavoj Žižek Sorta Kinda Admits Plagiarizing White Supremacist Journal|url=http://gawker.com/slavoj-zizek-sorta-kinda-admits-plagiarizing-white-supr-1604590014|website=Gawker.com|publisher=Gawker Online|accessdate=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Chomsky===
[[Noam Chomsky]] is critical of Žižek saying Žižek is guilty of "using fancy terms like polysyllables and pretending you have a theory when you have no theory whatsoever,"  and also said that Žižek’s theories never go "beyond the level of something you can explain in five minutes to a twelve-year-old."&lt;ref&gt;Springer, Mike (28 June 2013).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13980">In [[mathematics]], the '''symmetry of second derivatives''' (also called the '''equality of mixed partials''') refers to the possibility under certain conditions (see below) of interchanging the order of taking [[partial derivative]]s of a function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x_{1},x_{2}, \dots ,x_{n})&lt;/math&gt;

of ''n'' variables. If the partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted with a subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, then the symmetry is the assertion that the second-order partial derivatives &lt;math&gt;f_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the identity

:&lt;math&gt;f_{ij}=f_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;

so that they form an ''n'' × ''n'' [[symmetric matrix]]. This is sometimes known as '''Schwarz's theorem''', '''Clairaut's theorem''', or '''Young's theorem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://are.berkeley.edu/courses/ARE210/fall2005/lecture_notes/Young%27s-Theorem.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518134739/http://are.berkeley.edu/courses/ARE210/fall2005/lecture_notes/Young%27s-Theorem.pdf |archivedate=May 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=R. G. D. |title=Mathematical Analysis for Economists |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1964 |isbn= |pages=300–305 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgm9O6reUcsC&amp;pg=PA300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[partial differential equation]]s it is called the
'''Schwarz [[integrability conditions for differential systems|integrability]] condition'''. &lt;!-- In physics, however, it is important
for the understanding of many phenomena in nature to remove this restrictions and allow functions to violate the
Schwarz integrability criterion, which makes them multivalued.
The simplest example is the function
&lt;math&gt;\arctan\; y/x&lt;/math&gt;. At first one defines this with a cut
in the complex
&lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;-plane running from 0 to infinity.
The cut makes the function single-valued. In complex analysis, however, one thinks of this function as having several 'sheets' (forming a [[Riemann surface]]).
 It is useless until they explain where and how the function violates Schwarz integrability condition --&gt;

== Hessian matrix ==

This matrix of second-order partial derivatives of ''f'' is called the '''[[Hessian matrix]]''' of ''f''. The entries in it off the [[main diagonal]] are the '''mixed derivatives'''; that is, successive partial derivatives with respect to different variables.

In most "real-life" circumstances the Hessian matrix is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]], although there are a great number of functions that do not have this property. [[Mathematical analysis]] reveals that symmetry requires a hypothesis on ''f'' that goes further than simply stating the existence of the second derivatives at a particular point. [[#Schwarz's theorem|Schwarz' theorem]] gives a sufficient condition on ''f'' for this to occur.

== Formal expressions of symmetry ==
In symbols, the symmetry says that, for example,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac { \partial f }{ \partial y} \right) =
       \frac {\partial}{\partial y} \left( \frac { \partial f }{ \partial x} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

This equality can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{xy} f = \partial_{yx} f.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the symmetry can be written as an algebraic statement involving the [[differential operator]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which  takes the partial derivative with respect to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; . ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; . ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

From this relation it follows that the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of differential operators with [[constant coefficients]], generated by the ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, is [[commutative]]. But one should naturally specify some domain for these operators. It is easy to check the symmetry as applied to [[monomial]]s, so that one can take [[polynomial]]s in the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as a domain. In fact [[smooth function]]s are possible.

== Schwarz's theorem&lt;!--'Schwarz's theorem' and 'Clairaut's theorem on equality of mixed partials' redirect here--&gt; ==
In [[mathematical]] [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], '''Schwarz's theorem'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (or '''Clairaut's theorem on equality of mixed partials'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=R. C. |year=1966 |title=Advanced Calculus |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5kpAQAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Hermann Schwarz]], states that if

:&lt;math&gt;f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

has [[continuous function|continuous]] second [[partial derivatives]] at a given point in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;, say, &lt;math&gt; (a_1, \dots, a_n),&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\forall i, j \in \{ 1,2,\ldots, n\},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i\, \partial x_j}(a_1, \dots, a_n) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_j\, \partial x_i}(a_1, \dots, a_n).&lt;/math&gt;

The partial differentiations of this function are [[commutative operation|commutative]] at that point. One easy way to establish this theorem (in the case where &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;j = 2&lt;/math&gt;, which readily entails the result in general) is by applying [[Green's theorem]] to the [[gradient]] of &lt;math&gt;f.&lt;/math&gt;

== Sufficiency of twice-differentiability ==
A weaker condition than the continuity of second partial derivatives (which is implied by the latter) which suffices to ensure symmetry is that all partial derivatives are themselves [[Differentiable function#Differentiability in higher dimensions|differentiable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=John|last2=Hubbard|first2=Barbara|title=Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms|publisher=Matrix Editions|pages=732–733|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strengthening of the theorem, in which ''existence'' of the permuted mixed partial is asserted, was provided by Peano:

''If &lt;math&gt;f:E\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined on an open set &lt;math&gt;E\subset \R^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_1f, D_2f, D_{2,1}f&lt;/math&gt; exist everywhere on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; , and &lt;math&gt;D_{2,1}f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\in E&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;D_{1,2}f&lt;/math&gt; exists at &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_{1,2}f(a,b)=D_{2,1}f(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|location=New York|pages=235-236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The result of the equality of the mixed partial derivatives under certain conditions has a long history.  [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli]] implicitly assumed the result as early as 1721, but [[Euler]] was the first to provide a proof.  Other proofs followed by [[Alexis Clairaut|Clairaut]] (1740), [[Lagrange]] (1797), [[Cauchy]] (1823) and many others in the 19th century.  None of these proofs were without fault however (for example, Clairaut assumed all definite integrals could be differentiated under the integral sign).  In 1867 [[Ernst Leonard Lindelöf]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindelöf|first1=Ernst Leonard|title=Remarques sur les différentes manières d'établir la formule &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 z}{d xd y} = \frac{d^2 z}{d yd x}&lt;/math&gt;|journal=Acta Societatis Scientiarum Fennicae|date=1867|volume=8, part 1|pages=205–213|url=https://archive.org/stream/actasocietatissc81suom#page/205/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing in detail all the proofs he was familiar with.  Finally, six years later [[Hermann Schwarz]] (1873) gave the first satisfactory proof. This was followed by successive refinements that relaxed the hypotheses in Schwarz's theorem in various ways, among others by [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]], [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]], [[Peano]], [[E. W. Hobson]], [[W. H. Young]]. For a good historical account, see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Higgins|first1=Thomas James|title=A note on the history of mixed partial derivatives|journal=Scripta Mathematica|date=1940|volume=7|pages=59–62|url=http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=13&amp;threadID=1580215&amp;messageID=5765194|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution theory formulation ==

The theory of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] (generalized functions) eliminates analytic problems with the symmetry. The derivative of an [[integrable]] function can always be defined as a distribution, and symmetry of mixed partial derivatives always holds as an equality of distributions. The use of formal [[integration by parts]] to define differentiation of distributions puts the symmetry question back onto the [[test function]]s, which are smooth and certainly satisfy this symmetry. In more detail (where ''f'' is a distribution, written as an operator on test functions, and ''φ'' is a test function),
: &lt;math&gt; (D_1D_2f)[\phi] = -(D_2f)[D_1\phi] = f[D_2D_1\phi] = f[D_1D_2\phi] = -(D_1f)[D_2\phi] = (D_2D_1f)[\phi] .&lt;/math&gt;

Another approach, which defines the [[Fourier transform]] of a function, is to note that on such transforms partial derivatives become multiplication operators that commute much more obviously.

== Requirement of continuity ==
The symmetry may be broken if the function fails to have differentiable partial derivatives, which is possible if Clairaut's theorem is not satisfied (the second partial derivatives are not [[Continuous function|continuous]]).

[[File:Graph001.png|thumb|right|The function ''f(x,y)'', as shown in equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), does not have symmetric second derivatives at its origin.]]
An example of non-symmetry is the function
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \begin{cases}
                     \frac{xy(x^2 - y^2)}{x^2+y^2} &amp; \mbox{ for } (x, y) \ne (0, 0)\\
                      0                            &amp; \mbox{ for } (x, y) = (0, 0).
                \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
This function is everywhere continuous, but its derivatives at (0,0) cannot be computed algebraically. Rather, the limit of difference quotients shows that &lt;math&gt;\partial_x f|_{(0,0)}=\partial_y f|_{(0,0)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so the graph z = f(x,y) has a horizontal tangent plane at (0,0), and the partial derivatives &lt;math&gt;\partial_x f, \partial_y f&lt;/math&gt; exist and are everywhere continuous. However, the second partial derivatives are not continuous at (0,0), and the symmetry fails. In fact, along the ''x''-axis the ''y''-derivative is &lt;math&gt;\partial_y f|_{(x,0)}=x&lt;/math&gt;, and so:
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_x\partial_y f|_{(0,0)} =
\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0} \frac { \partial_y f|_{(\epsilon,0)}-\partial_y f|_{(0,0)} } \epsilon = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
In contrast, along the ''y''-axis the ''x''-derivative &lt;math&gt;\partial_x f|_{(0,y)}=-y&lt;/math&gt;,
and so &lt;math&gt;\partial_y\partial_x f|_{(0,0)} = -1&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, &lt;math&gt;\partial_{xy}f\ne\partial_{yx}f&lt;/math&gt; at (0,&amp;nbsp;0), although the mixed partial derivatives do exist, and at every other point the symmetry does hold.

The above function, written in a cylindrical coordinate system, can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;f(r, \theta) = \frac{r^2 \sin{4\theta}}{4},&lt;/math&gt;
showing that the function oscillates four times when traveling once around an arbitrarily small loop containing the origin. Intuitively, therefore, the local behavior of the function at &lt;math&gt;(0, 0)&lt;/math&gt; cannot be described as a quadratic form, and the Hessian matrix thus fails to be symmetric.

In general, the [[interchange of limiting operations]] need not [[Commutative property|commute]]. Given two variables near (0,&amp;nbsp;0) and two limiting processes on
:&lt;math&gt;f(h,k) - f(h,0) - f(0,k) + f(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;
corresponding to making ''h'' → 0 first, and to making ''k'' → 0 first. It can matter, looking at the first-order terms, which is applied first. This leads to the construction of [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] examples in which second derivatives are non-symmetric. This kind of example belongs to the theory of [[real analysis]] where the pointwise value of functions matters.  When viewed as a distribution the second partial derivative's values can be changed at an arbitrary set of points as long as this has Lebesgue measure 0. Since in the example the Hessian is symmetric everywhere except (0,0), there is no contradiction with the fact that the Hessian, viewed as a [[Schwartz distribution]], is symmetric.

== In Lie theory ==
Consider the first-order differential operators ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be [[infinitesimal operator]]s on [[Euclidean space]]. That is, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in a sense generates the [[one-parameter group]] of [[translation]]s parallel to the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;-axis. These groups commute with each other, and therefore the [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated to a Lie group|infinitesimal generators]] do also; the [[Lie bracket]]

:[''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;] = 0

is this property's  reflection. In other words, the Lie derivative of one coordinate with respect to another is zero.

== Application to differential forms ==
The Clairaut-Schwarz theorem is the key fact needed to prove that for every &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt;(or at least twice continuously differentiable) [[differential form]] &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt;, the second exterior derivative vanishes: &lt;math&gt;d^2\omega:=d(d\omega)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  This implies that every [[Exact differential form|exact]] form (i.e., a form &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha=d\omega&lt;/math&gt; for some form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;) is [[Closed differential form|closed]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;d\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt;), since &lt;math&gt;d\alpha=d(d\omega)=0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/TuL.W.AnIntroductionToManifolds2e2010Springer|title=An Introduction to Manifolds|last=Tu|first=Loring W.|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4419-7399-3|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''talent manager''' (also known as an '''artist manager''', '''band manager''' or '''music manager''') is an individual or company who guides the professional career of [[entertainer|artists]] in the [[entertainment industry]]. The responsibility of the talent manager is to oversee the day-to-day [[business]] affairs of an artist; advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters, long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career.&lt;ref name="casestudy"&gt;[http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm MusicBizAdvice Q&amp;A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115173626/http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm |date=2009-01-15 }} January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   

The roles and responsibilities of a talent manager vary slightly from industry to industry, as do the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to which the manager is entitled. For example, a music manager's duties differ from those managers who advise [[actor]]s, [[writer]]s, or [[film director|director]]s. A manager can also help artists find an agent, or help them decide when to leave their current agent and identify who to select as a new agent.&lt;ref name="breakingintrodummies"&gt;Garrison, Larry. ''Breaking Into Acting for Dummies'', Wiley Publishing Inc., 2002, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talent agent]]s have the authority to make deals for their clients while managers usually can only informally establish connections with producers and studios but do not have the ability to negotiate contracts.

==History==
{{See also|Category:Talent agents}}
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
Modern talents managers are associated with all artistic fields, sports, as well as various fields in business.{{cn|date=February 2015}} Talent agents have at times been covered in the music or art press almost as intently as artists themselves, for example the various talent agents who spearheaded the British Invasion of [[The Beatles]] and [[Herman's Hermits]] in the 1960s such as [[Brian Epstein]], [[Allan Williams]], [[Harvey Lisberg]]. Infamous examples in the music press include [[Allen Klein]], manager of both The Beatles and [[The Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/allen-klein-notorious-business-manager-for-the-beatles-and-the-rolling-stones-1732780.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=July 6, 2009 | title=Allen Klein: Notorious business manager for the Beatles and the Rolling Stones}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a list of talent agents deemed notable by [[wp:GNG|Wikipedia's general notability guidelines]], see [[:Category:Talent agents]]. For notable agencies and businesses, see [[:Category:Talent agencies]].

The industry of talent management has been unionized or organized in several forms throughout history. In the United States, a notable early example was the [[Association of Talent Agents]], which was formed in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1937. The ATA comes out of the [[Wagner Act]] upheld by the Supreme Court which established many of the unions and guilds that regulate people who work in the entertainment industry such as the [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[Directors Guild of America]], and [[Writers Guild of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agentassociation.com/ Association of Talent Agents]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music managers==&lt;!--Linked to from "Music management"--&gt;
A music manager (or band manager) may handle career areas for [[Musical ensemble|bands]], [[singers]], and [[DJ]]s. A music manager may be hired by a musician or band, or the manager  may discover the band, and the relationship is usually contractually bound with mutual assurances, warranties, performances guarantees, and so forth.  The manager's main job is to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotion, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers can be extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, [[business manager]] (who are usually [[certified public accountants]]), [[Tour promoter|tour managers]], and sometimes even a [[personal assistant]].  

Manager's contracts, however, cannot license those responsibilities unto the manager in the same way a state license would empower the agent to do so.  Therefore, conflicting areas of interest may arise unless those are clarified in the contract.  That said, a manager should be able to read and understand and explain a [[contract]] and study up on the long-term implications of contractual agreements that they, the bands, and the people they do business with, enter into. Before the manager enters into an agreement with the band, their relationship may be regarded as competing for interest; after a good contract is signed, their interests, obligations and incentives are aligned, and the interest in success is shared.  

Responsibilities of a music manager are often divided among many who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers may assume multiple roles: graphic designer, [[publicist]], promoter, and handling money and finances. As an artist's career develops, responsibilities may grow, and because of their percentage agreement with the band, the manager's income may grow as well. 

A music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, [[songwriter]]s, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding [[Record producer|music producers]], and developing relationships with [[Record company|record companies]], publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. They should carefully consider when certain contributions have been made which would also entitle them to cowriting credits, Executive Producer credit, or Producer credit should they become involved in songwriting, financing works, or actually producing demos and recordings, and should carefully know these jobs and these fees should be considered either as separate from the contract, in addition to the contract, or as free to the musician as clarified in emails and the contract.  

The duties of an active music manager may include supporting the band's development of a reputation for the musician(s) and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, creating social network identities for bands, and booking shows. A music manager may be present during recording sessions and should support the artist during the creative process while not interfering between the artist and the producer, but musicians may also find valuable feedback in the extra pair of ears and this should be carefully considered as well. The manager may gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.

Among all the business and professional responsibilities that music managers assume; they also become a pseudo parent for the group and help with personal matters usually. This is both for the psyche of the group and to ensure that things are running smoothly.  

Early on in an artist's career, the different facets of management and [[marketing]] fall upon either the band itself or, if they have one, their manager. Because the band or artist is relatively unknown initially, promotion, booking, and touring are minimal. A new music manager begins by establishing a clear understanding of what the artist(s) want. This can be accomplished through either a written or verbal [[contract]]. A music manager's first task is to solidify all artist development aspects and then concentrate on product development.

==Management strategies==
Despite the dominant presence of digital media in the music industry, there are many typical strategies that even the most modernized managers must adhere to in order to reach the managerial goals effectively. Most of these trick-of-the-trade strategies are employed to establish and maintain connections with booking agents, promote the activities of the artist, and manage finances in order to optimize the artist's ability to book gigs, establish a fan base, and ultimately bring in revenue from their work, respectively.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Booking gigs===
Among the more traditional responsibilities of music managers are booking and promoting gigs for their artist(s). Managers often become known for establishing ongoing relationships with specific venues, booking one artist at the venue regularly, or several artists on their roster.&lt;ref&gt;Farrish, Bryan. Gig Booking 101 – Venue Relationships. Bryan Farrish Radio Promotion: Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of 'how-to' books have been published on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin, June 11, 2010, A Booking Strategy that Works! The DIY Musician (2010): Accessed March 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet strategies===
As technology has advanced, the music industry has consequently undergone a drastic change in the way it operates. The internet has made it both easier and harder to attract the attention of fans and the press, as both outreach increase but industry saturation increases.{{cn|date=February 2015}} “The sale of pre-recorded music has diminished, but there’s so much more that’s going on. You can’t focus on what’s not working when there are so many other opportunities.”.&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, Don and Dan Kimpel. “Chapter 6: The Manager.” In It All Begins With The Music. Boston: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media is a common form of online networking for managers, and platforms such as [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], [[Beatport]], [[Bandcamp]], [[SoundCloud]], and [[YouTube]] have been noted in the press for their use in networking in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Bryan. Music Marketing with Social Media in Only 30 Minutes a Day. The DIY Musician (2012): Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fields such as business may use more common websites such as [[LinkedIn]] or [[Google+]], while networking on behalf of a client.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Not everyone is so optimistic about the role of social media in the music industry. In his article, “Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media”, Wes Davenport suggests that the role of social media in the industry “has been grossly inflated”. In the article, Davenport quotes Jon Ostrow saying, “Social media is a conversation tool – that’s it”, acknowledging that there is potential for sparking conversation and building a fan base, but suggesting that social media does not necessarily live up to the potential for success that people in our modern culture seem to give credit.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Wes. Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media. Hypebot.com (2013): Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital case Study: Lady Gaga===
In an article titled, “Case study: Making money from music” by Martin Kupp, [[Jamie Anderson (scientist)|Jamie Anderson]] and Joerg Reckhenrich, the effects of technological advances on the music industry are recognized, analyzed, and utilized through an online marketing strategy that led to the incredible success of [[Lady Gaga]]. [[Troy Carter (music industry)|Troy Carter]] of Coalition Media signed Gaga with the intention of making her into a star with the help of some clever marketing. Recognizing that digitalization was the cause of the almost 33% decrease in the music industry’s total revenue between the years 2000 and 2007, Carter decided to find a way to use digitalization to his advantage with his newly signed artist. Coalition Media, with the help of marketing company ThinkTank Digital, invested large amounts of time and money into developing Lady Gaga’s global presence through social media. 

They set up many interviews with [[Bloggers|online bloggers]], established a large following on Myspace through “constant news updates, as well as [[:wikt:exclusive|exclusives]], [[interviews]] and special features” and Gaga personally handled her Twitter account, building a very personal connection with many of her fans. This strategy demonstrates the massive success that skillful online marketing can produce. The article focuses on Coalition Media and [[Lady Gaga]]’s utilization of the “Four E’s”: [[Emotions]], [[Experiences]], [[:wikt:engage|Engaging]], and [[:wikt:exclusive|Exclusive]]. By personalizing her online activity, creating an experience, engaging, and providing exclusivity to her fans through social media marketing, [[Lady Gaga]] was able to achieve incredible levels of success with her music career.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kupp, Jamie Anderson and Joerg Reckhenrich. Case Study: Making Money From Music. The Financial Times LTD (2011): Accessed March 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation==
Striking a tentative compensation agreement that can be renegotiated after three or four months is recommended, and the rate of pay is generally based on [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s of 20-80 percent, or more, of performance and commercial incomes.{{cn|date=February 2015}}  This amount depends on the level of development the band or artist is at and the experience, networks and resources of the manager. (The less developed the artist and more experienced the manager, the higher the commission.) The artist or band should never agree to circumstances that cannot be terminated or negotiated within a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapositiveradio.com/general/dir/band_manager Band Manager Info at Media Positive Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Managers usually secure the services of a professional [[photographer]] while the artist is recording. Different 8x10 pictures of the artist can be used for websites, [[compact disc|CD]] labels/jackets, posters, and the [[press kit]]. Cost for high quality shoots vary from $500 for a basic shoot to thousands for several looks. Photographers are not expected to cover material cost. It is important that the manager obtains an agreement upfront confirming license to use the images which will cover the uses necessary, in addition to high resolution digital images on CD.  Managers are also advised to have photographs taken before CD designs or artwork goes into production.  Managers are also responsible for hiring additional staff when necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7099">"'''Television and the Public Interest'''" was a speech given by [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) chairman [[Newton N. Minow]] to the convention of the [[National Association of Broadcasters]] on May 9, 1961. The speech was Minow's first major speech after he was appointed chairman of the FCC by President [[John F. Kennedy]]. In the speech, Minow referred to American commercial television programming as a "'''vast wasteland'''" and advocated for programming in the [[public interest]]. In hindsight, the speech marked the end of a [[Golden Age of Television]] that had run through the 1950s, contrasting the highbrow programs of that decade with what had appeared on American television in [[1960–61 United States network television schedule|1960 and 1961]].

{{quote|When television is good, nothing &amp;mdash; not the theater, not the magazines or newspapers &amp;mdash; nothing is better.

But when television is bad, nothing is worse. I invite each of you to sit down in front of your own television set when your station goes on the air and stay there, for a day, without a book, without a magazine, without a newspaper, without a profit and loss sheet or a rating book to distract you. Keep your eyes glued to that set until the station signs off. I can assure you that what you will observe is a vast wasteland.

You will see a procession of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, western bad men, western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons. And endlessly commercials &amp;mdash; many screaming, cajoling, and offending. And most of all, boredom. True, you'll see a few things you will enjoy. But they will be very, very few. And if you think I exaggerate, I only ask you to try it.&lt;ref&gt;Newton N. Minow, "[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/newtonminow.htm Television and the Public Interest]", address to the National Association of Broadcasters, Washington, D.C., May 9, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his speech Minow also shared advice to his audience:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Television and all who participate in it are jointly accountable to the American public for respect for the special needs of children, for community responsibility, for the advancement of education and culture, for the acceptability of the program materials chosen, for decency and decorum in production, and for propriety in advertising. This responsibility cannot be discharged by any given group of programs, but can be discharged only through the highest standards of respect for the American home, applied to every moment of every program presented by television. Program materials should enlarge the horizons of the viewer, provide him with wholesome entertainment, afford helpful stimulation, and remind him of the responsibilities which the citizen has toward his society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/reference/documents/vast_wasteland.htm|title=Newton Minow: The 'vast wasteland' of television speech|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was a landmark speech for the medium of [[television]], at a time when there were only three networks in the United States and when the realm of television was much less vast than it would later become.  Nonetheless, it is counted as one of a hundred best American speeches of the 20th century by several authorities and selected as one of twenty-five 'Speeches that Changed the World' by Vital Speeches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcmurry.com/pdf/01_04_07_BestofVitalSpeeches.pdf The Best of Vital Speeches of the Day: 25 Speeches That Changed Our World.] ''McMurry.'' 4 Jan. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=November 2018}} Related writings include his book (co-written with Craig LaMay) ''Abandoned in the Wasteland: Children, Television, &amp; the First Amendment''.

The phrase "vast wasteland" was suggested to Minow by his friend, reporter and freelance writer [[John Bartlow Martin]]. Martin had recently watched twenty consecutive hours of television as research for a magazine piece, and concluded it was "a vast wasteland of junk." During the editing process, Minow cut the words "of junk." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fallows|first=James|title=Where the Phrase 'Vast Wasteland' Came From|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/05/where-the-phrase-vast-wasteland-came-from/238743/|accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=The Atlantic Monthly|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Minow often remarks that the two words best remembered from the speech are "vast wasteland," but the two words he wishes would be remembered are "public interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ted|title="A Vast Wasteland," 50 Years Later|url=http://www.wilshireandwashington.com/2011/05/a-vast-wasteland-50-years-later.html|accessdate=12 May 2011|newspaper=Variety magazine|date=9 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517224745/http://www.wilshireandwashington.com/2011/05/a-vast-wasteland-50-years-later.html|archivedate=17 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lambasting of the state of United States television programming prompted Sherwood Schwartz to name the boat on his television show ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' after Newton Minow; the wreck was named the ''Minnow''.&lt;ref name=SantaClaraLawReview&gt;{{cite book|author=Schwartz, Sherwood|title=Inside Gilligan's Island |year=1994|pages=xv}} cited in {{cite journal|url=http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/lawreview/vol39/iss1/4/|title=Legal Tales from Gilligan's Island|author=Jarvis, Robert M. |journal=Santa Clara Law Review|publisher=Santa Clara University Law School |year=1998|volume=39|pages=185|accessdate=2014-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Grand Canal in Venice from Palazzo Flangini to Campo San Marcuola''''' is a painting by  [[Canaletto]] in the [[Getty Museum|J. Paul Getty Museum]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-getty-rembrandt-laughing-20130509,0,3699696.story Getty Museum buys 'Rembrandt Laughing': tiny portrait, huge value], Jori Finkel, [[The Los Angeles Times]], May 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Painted around 1738, it may have been commissioned by the English merchant and art collector [[Joseph Smith (1682–1770)]].

==Description==
The composition depicts the upper reaches of the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] near the entrance to the Cannaregio Canal. It is a typical example of the [[veduta|''vedute'']] paintings popular with [[Grand Tour]] travelers as a visual record of their stay in Venice. 

The viewer’s vantage point is in the middle of the canal, surrounded by [[gondola]]s, barges, and the buildings lining the banks. Many of the structures depicted by Canaletto still stand today, for example [[Palazzo Flangini, Venice|Palazzo Flangini]], the building at far left, which retains its off-center entrance portal.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://picasaweb.google.com/pegamini/Venezia2010#5503811594150153058 Palazzo Flangini, Venice]", photograph by Gunther H.G. Geick, 2010, retrieved May 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; To the right of the palace, the [[lantern]] on the dome of the church of [[San Geremia]] is visible, followed by the gabled ''canonica'' (rectory) of San Geremia. The trees appearing over a garden wall mark the corner of the Grand Canal and the Cannaregio Canal, which branches off to the left. The garden belongs to [[Palazzo Labia]], the first building on the Cannaregio Canal, adjacent to San Geremia but hidden from view in the painting. The very last building visible in the background of the painting is [[Ca' Vendramin Calergi|Palazzo Vendramin Calergi]], partly cut off due to the canal’s curve to the right.

The painting also records the ''traghetto'', a ferry service using row boats that was the primary means of crossing the Grand Canal prior to the construction of most of the bridges that span it today. One such boat is seen departing from the Riva di Biasio in the foreground at right, while another is prominently shown in the middle of the canal.

'''The London Group''' is a society based in [[London]], England, created to offer additional exhibiting opportunities to artists besides the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. Formed in 1913, it is one of the oldest artist-led organisations in the world. It was formed from the merger of the [[Camden Town Group]], an all-male group, and the Fitzroy Street Group. It holds open submission exhibitions for members and guest artists.

== Overview ==
The London Group is composed of working artists. All forms of art are represented. The group functions democratically without dogma or style.&lt;ref name="Redfern"&gt;Redfern, David [https://books.google.com/books?id=hzMSSQAACAAJ ''The London Group: origins and Post War history'']. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It has a written constitution, annually elected officers, working committees and a selection committee. There are usually between 80 and 100 members and an annual fee is charged to cover gallery hire and organisational costs. The group has no permanent exhibition venue and rents gallery space in London, most recently at the Menier Gallery, [[Bankside Gallery]] and Cello Factory. New members are elected most years, from nominations made by current members.&lt;ref name="Redfern"/&gt;

==History==
The London Group was founded in 1913, when the [[Camden Town Group]] came together with the English [[Vorticists]] and other independent artists to challenge the domination of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], which had become unadventurous and conservative.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcox, Denys J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=EtNPAAAAMAAJ ''The London Group, 1913-1939: the artists and their works'']. Scholar Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The London Group emerged from a merger of the Fitzroy Street Group and the male-member-only Camden Town Group organization.&lt;ref name="Redfern"/&gt; Founding members included the patron-artist [[Ethel Sands]], artist [[Anna Hope Hudson]],&lt;ref name="Tate Ethel bio"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/camden-town-group/ethel-sands-r1105348 Ethel Sands.] Tate.

The open submissions are shown along with the work of existing members and guest artists.&lt;ref name="DRedfern"/&gt; The exhibition Uproar! celebrated the first 50 years of the London Group in 1963 and it highlighted the role played by women and emigre artists in its membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/uproar-the-first-50-years-of-the-london-group-1913-1963] Review in ''Studio International'' from 1963&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013-14 the [[Ben Uri Gallery]] celebrated The London Group's 100-year anniversary with an exhibition Uproar: The First 50 Years of The London Group 1913-1963 curated by Rachel Dickson and Sarah MacDougall.&lt;ref name="Dickson, Rachel 2013"/&gt;

One of the oldest standing artist-led organisations in the world, The London Group continues to exist today with over 80 members. In 2011 the open exhibition presented over 140 artists at the Cello Factory. The group celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2013 with several shows, both historical and contemporary.&lt;ref name="Redfern"/&gt;

'''''The Magpie''''' ({{lang-fr|La Pie}}) is an oil-on-canvas landscape painting by the French [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] [[Claude Monet]], created during the winter of 1868&amp;ndash;1869 near the commune of [[Étretat]] in [[Normandy]]. Monet's patron, Louis Joachim Gaudibert, helped arrange a house in Étretat for Monet's fiancée [[Camille Doncieux]] and their newborn son, allowing Monet to paint in relative comfort, surrounded by his family.

Between 1867 and 1893, Monet and fellow Impressionists [[Alfred Sisley]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] painted hundreds of landscapes illustrating the natural effect of snow (''effet de neige'').  Similar winter paintings were produced by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]], and [[Paul Gauguin]].  Art historians believe that a series of severe winters in France contributed to an increase in the number of winter landscapes produced by Impressionists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rathbone|1999|p=22}}; {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|pp=23–27}}; For the range of 63 major works produced from 1867–1893, see Moffett et al. 1999.  This arbitrary time period was established for the first ''[[Impressionists in Winter|Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige]] '' exhibition, based on historical reports of severe winters collected by curators.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Magpie'' is one of approximately 140 snowscapes produced by Monet.  His first snowscape, ''[[A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur]]'', was painted sometime in either 1865 or 1867, followed by a notable series of snowscapes in the same year, beginning with the ''[[Road by Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter]]''.  ''The Magpie'' was completed in 1869 and is Monet's largest winter painting.  It was followed by ''[[The Red Cape]]'' (1869–1871), the only known winter painting featuring Camille Doncieux.&lt;ref&gt;Moffett et al. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The canvas of ''The Magpie'' depicts a solitary black [[magpie]] perched on a gate formed in a [[wattle (construction)|wattle]] [[fence]], as the light of the sun shines upon freshly fallen snow creating blue shadows.  The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of [[colored shadow]]s, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] earlier in the century.

At the time, Monet's innovative use of light and color led to its rejection by the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1869. Today, art historians classify ''The Magpie'' as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings.&lt;ref name="RouartGedo"&gt;Arts Council of Great Britain 1957, p. 43: "Perhaps Monet's greatest snow landscape."; {{harvnb|Rouart|1958|p=41}}: "This, Monet's finest snowscape..."; {{harvnb|Gedo|2010|p=89}}: "...one of the most magnificent snow scenes in his entire oeuvre..."&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was privately held until the [[Musée d'Orsay]] acquired it in 1984; it is considered one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.

==Background==
{{main|Claude Monet}}
In the late 1850s, French landscape painter [[Eugène Boudin]] (1824&amp;ndash;1898) introduced Monet (1840&amp;ndash;1926) to the art of painting ''[[en plein air]]''—"in the open air", using natural light. The invention of the collapsible [[metal paint tube]] (1841) and [[easel|portable easel]] brought painting, formerly confined to [[studio]]s, into the outdoors. Boudin and Monet spent the summer of 1858 painting nature together. Like Boudin, Monet came to prefer painting outdoors rather than in a studio, the convention of the time. "If I have become a painter," Monet said, "I owe it to Boudin."{{sfn|Rouart|1958|p=24}}
[[File:Monet - The Cart.jpg|thumb|left|''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'' (1865 or 1867), Monet's first snowscape.]]
The landscape paintings of Dutch painter [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]] (1819&amp;ndash;1891) influenced both Boudin and Monet and contributed to the development of early Impressionism. After meeting Jongkind in [[Sainte-Adresse]] in 1862,{{sfn|Herbert|1996|p=14}} Monet began to cultivate an interest in Jongkind's perspective on the changing conditions of the landscape. From Jongkind, Monet learned to substitute optical color for [[Local color (visual art)|local color]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathey|1961|p=59}}: "...Jongkind discovered how the so-called "local color" changes with the seasons...It suddenly came to him that for the artist appearance, not reality, was the determining factor...the only thing that did matter was the atmospheric condition at a given moment. He shared this revelation with Monet, who, in turn, experimented by making two paintings of a road in Normandy from the same vantage point—the first one under a cloudy sky, and the second when the road was covered with snow."&lt;/ref&gt; "Complementing the teaching I received from Boudin, Jongkind was from that moment my true master," Monet later reminisced.{{sfn|Isham|2004|p=332}} "It was he who completed the education of my eye".{{sfn|Heinrich|2000|p=9}} This new way of seeing, a shift from a conceptual to a perceptual approach, formed the basis for Monet's ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks]]'' (1890-1891), a series of 25 works showing the effects of dynamic atmospheric conditions over time on a single [[haystack]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]].

[[Gustave Courbet]] (1819&amp;ndash;1877) had been painting ''effets de neige'', "snow effects", from as early as 1856,&lt;ref&gt;Courbet, Gustave (1856). ''Trees in the Snow''. National Galleries of Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt; in a landscape style preferred by Japanese, Dutch, and Flemish artists. Influenced by Courbet, Monet painted his first snowscape, ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'' (1865 or 1867).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/index-of-works/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=805 Musée d'Orsay]: "With this choice of theme, Monet was following in the footsteps of Courbet who had tackled snowscapes in a number of genre scenes. But unlike the older painter, whose principal motif remained the stag and the hunter and who produced many anecdotal scenes, Monet painted an almost deserted landscape, where the cart and its occupant play a very minor role." The painting was originally dated 1865 by Monet.  However, correspondence by painter Alexandre Dubourg points to a later date of 1867.  In {{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=80}}, Eliza Rathbone notes that the date is disputed by scholars.&lt;/ref&gt; A journalist observed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have only seen him once. It was in the winter, during several days of snow, when communications were virtually at a standstill. It was cold enough to split stones. We noticed a foot-warmer, then an easel, then a man, swathed in three coats, his hands in gloves, his face half-frozen. It was M. Monet, studying a snow effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|House|1988|p=137}} Published in October 1868, but the anecdote is thought to refer to the previous winter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
In ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'', Monet avoided the usual hunting genre and motifs used by Courbet. Instead, he focused on light and color in a new way by reducing the number of shades. Monet chose an [[earth tone]] color scheme and increased the number of shades of blue to highlight reflections on the snow.  Monet followed ''A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'' with a notable series of snowscapes in 1867 including ''[[Road by Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter]]''.

==First Étretat campaign==
In 1867, Monet's girlfriend, Camille Doncieux (1847&amp;ndash;1879), gave birth to their son Jean in Paris. Lacking money, Monet returned to his father's house in [[Sainte-Adresse]] and lived with his aunt, leaving Doncieux and their child in Paris. Monet married Doncieux in 1870. Mme. Louis Joachim Gaudibert, an art collector, became Monet's first patron. Gaudibert helped Monet rent a house in Étretat for Doncieux and Jean in late 1868. Recovering from an episode of depression, Monet joined Doncieux and Jean at the house in Étretat in October, with Doncieux in the role of muse and life model.&lt;ref name="cdm2"/&gt; By December, Monet was in great spirits, "surrounded by everything that I love", and began to focus on painting. In a letter to [[Frédéric Bazille]] (1841&amp;ndash;1870), Monet wrote:

[[File:The Luncheon by Claude Monet - Städel - Frankfurt am Main - Germany 2017.jpg|thumb|220px|''The Luncheon'' (1868). Camille and son Jean in Étretat.&lt;ref&gt;For an extended discussion of ''The Luncheon'' (''Le Dejeuner'') and how it fits into the timeline of the first Étretat campaign, see: Wagner, Anne M. (1994) "Why Monet gave up figure painting." ''Art Bulletin'' '''74''' (4): 612. {{issn|0004-3079}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;I spend my time out in the open, on the shingle beach when the weather is bad or the fishing boats go out, or I go into the countryside which is very beautiful here, that I find perhaps still more charming in winter than in summer and, naturally I work all the time, and I believe that this year I am going to do some serious things.&lt;ref name="Gedo88"&gt;{{harvnb|Gedo|2010|p=88}}. See also: George, Serge (1996). ''Claude Monet''. Masterworks Series. Ramboro Books. p. 14. {{ISBN|1-56852-113-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although he enjoyed living with Camille and Jean in Étretat, Monet preferred to paint alone in the countryside. He told Bazille:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Don't you think that directly in nature and alone one does better?...I've always been of this mind, and what I do under these conditions has always been better. One is too much taken up with what one sees and hears in Paris, however firm one may be, and what I am painting here has at least the merit of not resembling anyone...because it will be simply the expression of what I shall have felt, I myself, personally.&lt;ref&gt;Wildenstein, I, 425-26: letter 44, Dec. 1868 as quoted in Isaacson 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During his time in Étretat, Monet completed three paintings of fishing boats,&lt;ref&gt;Includes ''Fishing Boats, Calm Weather'' (Bateaux de Pêche, temps calme) (W 123) and ''Fishing Boats at Sea'' (W 126). See also Rouart 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; one of a rural road,&lt;ref&gt;''Lane in Normandy'' (W 128).&lt;/ref&gt; and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, ''The Magpie'' ([[Wildenstein Index Number|W]] 133).&lt;ref name="Laclotte"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laclotte|first=Michel|year=1986|title=Painting in the Musée d'Orsay|publisher=Scala Publications|isbn=0-935748-72-5}} See also footnote 14 as cited in Herbert 1996, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, ''The Magpie'' is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|May|1999}}: "Over the course of 30 winters, he [Monet] executed some 140 snowy views"; Moffett et al. 1999, p. 55: "...Monet painted the largest number of winter scenes (more than 140) and is the best known impressionist painter of effets de neige. As Monet took advantage of most significant snowfalls, his output of winter landscapes was often more sporadic, with occasional bursts of activity followed by periods without production..."&lt;/ref&gt; the largest in its class.&lt;ref&gt;Myers 1998: "...his largest winter painting..."; {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|p=26}}: "It is Monet's largest and most ambitious snowscape, an essay about light and shadow on snow."&lt;/ref&gt; The exact location of the snow scene depicted in ''The Magpie'' is unknown.{{sfn|Rouart|1958|p=41}} [[Ralph T. Coe]] proposed that Monet painted the scene near the Farm Saint-Siméon above the Seine estuary in [[Honfleur]].{{sfn|Coe|1957|p=382}}

==Rejection by the Salon==
Monet submitted ''The Magpie'' and ''Fishing Boats at Sea'' (W 126) to the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1869.&lt;ref name="Gedo91"&gt;{{harvnb|Gedo|2010|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both paintings were rejected in April.{{sfn|Tinterow|Loyrette|1994|p=322}} Critic Paul Richard said that the jurors rejected the painting as "too common and too coarse".{{sfn|Richard|1998}} Monet's experimental use of color and radical departure from the descriptive, academic style surprised the public and probably contributed to its dismissal by the jury.&lt;ref&gt;Musée d'Orsay, ''Claude Monet The Magpie'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet told French novelist [[Arsène Houssaye]] (1815&amp;ndash;1896), "This rejection has taken the bread from my mouth, and in spite of my low prices, collectors and dealers turn their backs on me."&lt;ref name="Butler145"&gt;{{harvnb|Butler|2008|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, ''The Magpie'' was acquired by the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/catalogue-des-oeuvres/notice.html?nnumid=715|title=Musée d'Orsay: Notice d'Oeuvre|publisher=|quote=1984, acquis par les musées nationaux pour le musée d'Orsay (comité du 08/11/1984, conseil du 14/11/1984, arrêté du 14/12/1984)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became one of the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=13}}: "Visitor surveys and sales of postcard and reproductions indicate that it is the most popular single image in the museum"; Also see {{harvnb|Sweeney|1999|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical analysis==
In the painting, a black magpie is perched on a gate in a [[wattle (construction)|wattle]] [[fence]] as sunlight falls on fresh white snow, creating shadows. With no human figures present, the bird on the gate becomes the focus.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Rothkopf in {{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=84}}; {{harvnb|Mathieu|1987|p=78}}: "In the absence of any human figure, the central feature of the painting is the black bird perched on the gate, which is filled with an almost magical significance".&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Howard of [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] called the painting "an extraordinary evocation of the snow-bound chill of a late winter's afternoon. The blueness of the long shadows creates a delicate contrast with the creamy whites of the sky and landscape".&lt;ref&gt;Howard 1989, ''Monet'', p. 33 as quoted in {{harvnb|Meynell|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Lynn Orr, then of the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]], noted Monet's interest in the changing light that depended on the hour and the vagaries of the atmosphere:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Orr|1994|p=18}}: "...qualities of light characteristic of different times of day and in different atmospheric conditions."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unusual weather phenomena, such as snow and mist, fascinated Monet because they altered the chromatic appearance of familiar topography. In such paintings as ''The Magpie'', one of Monet's early masterpieces, form dissolves under the combination of a greatly restricted color range, aerial perspective, and broken brushwork. A virtuoso color performance, the painting is an essay on the variations of white perceptible in the reflection of sun on crisp new snow. Wonderfully abstract passages of flat color, such as the strong violet shades along the fence, are divorced from the spatial realities of the objects portrayed.{{sfn|Orr|1994|p=18}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Magpie'' is an early example of Monet's investigation of colored shadows. In this piece, Monet makes use of the [[complementary color]]s of blue and yellow. The shadow produced by yellow sunlight shining on the snow gives the impression of a blue-violet color,&lt;ref name="rcm3"&gt;{{harvnb|Magalhães|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the effect of [[simultaneous contrast]]. French Impressionists popularized the use of colored shadows, which went against the artistic convention of portraying shadows by darkening and [[Colorfulness|desaturating]] the color. Colored shadows can be directly observed in nature, particularly in the type of snow scene presented by Monet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hardin|1988|pp=50–51}}; {{harvnb|Schlichting|1999|pp=5–6}}; {{harvnb|Moffett|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his study of Impressionism, art historian [[John Rewald]] observed that artists used snowscapes to "investigate the problem of shadows".{{sfn|Rewald|1961|p=228}} The problem is summarized by Fred S. Kleiner in ''[[Gardner's Art Through the Ages]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;After scrutinizing the effects of light and color on forms, the Impressionists concluded that ''local color''—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified by the quality of the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the vibrating quality of light.{{sfn|Kleiner|2009|p=824}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Monet's use of colored shadows arose from color theories that were popular in the 19th century. German scientist [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749&amp;ndash;1832) published one of the first modern descriptions of colored shadows in his ''[[Theory of Colours]]'' (1810). Goethe attempted to challenge the theory of color propounded by [[Isaac Newton]] (1643&amp;ndash;1727) in his treatise on ''[[Opticks]]'' (1704). Goethe raised questions about subjective and objective color theory and perception, but his intuitive, non-mathematical approach was criticized as unscientific, and his attack on Newton was dismissed as a polemic. The questions Goethe raised about color persisted. Thirty years later, French chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] (1786&amp;ndash;1889) expanded on Goethe's theory with ''The Principles of Harmony and Contrast of Colors'' (1839).&lt;ref name="cdm2"&gt;{{harvnb|Magalhães|2003|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goethe and Chevreul's colour theory greatly influenced the [[art world]]. It is generally thought that [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and Monet incorporated elements of these theories into their work.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roque (1996) questions whether the Impressionists were aware of Chevreul's law of simultaneous contrast. Aside from Pissarro and Seurat, Roque can find no evidence that the Impressionists knew Chevreul's work directly. However, Backhaus et al. (1998) point out that it was possible the early Impressionists were familiar with the work of [[Eugène Delacroix]], who was intimate with Chevreul's color theories. It is generally accepted that as early as the 1860s, Monet was familiar with Delacroix's work and was influenced by his use of color.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Seurat]] (1859&amp;ndash;1891) came to prominence in 1886 with his technique of [[pointillism|chromatic division]], a style influenced by the color scheme theories of Chevreul and American physicist [[Ogden Rood]] (1831&amp;ndash;1902).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roque|1996|pp=26–39}}.

==Related work==
Monet's series of 11 paintings depicting ''The Bridge at Argenteuil'' (1874) also explored the use of colored shadows in its portrayal of the blue and purple shadow on the top portion of the bridge.{{sfn|Magalhães|2003|p=12}} Over the years, Monet became more and more obsessed with color and light. When his wife was dying in September 1879, Monet painted her in ''[[Camille Monet on Her Deathbed]]'' (1879), noting the "blue, yellow, grey tones". Monet told his friend, French statesman [[Georges Clemenceau]] (1841&amp;ndash;1929), that he spent the time "focusing on her temples and automatically analyzing the succession of appropriately graded colors which death was imposing on her motionless face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clemenceau|first=Georges|year=1926|title=Claude Monet: Les Nymphéas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camille died from cancer at the age of 32. After her death, Monet largely ceased painting people, focusing instead on natural landscapes.{{sfn|Meyers|2011|p=75}} Monet later returned to painting snow and colored shadows with ''[[Grainstacks Snow Effect]]'' (1891).{{sfn|Magalhães|2003|p=26}}

'''Émile Henri Bernard''' (28 April 1868 &amp;ndash; 16 April 1941) was a French [[Post-Impressionist]] painter and writer, who had artistic friendships with [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Eugène Boch]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eugeneboch.com Eugène Boch a common friend of Vincent van Gogh and Émile Bernard&lt;/ref&gt; and at a later time, [[Paul Cézanne]]. Most of his notable work was accomplished at a young age, in the years 1886 through 1897. He is also associated with [[Cloisonnism]] and [[Synthetism]], two late 19th-century [[art movements]]. Less known is Bernard's literary work, comprising plays, poetry, and art criticism as well as art historical statements that contain first-hand information on the crucial period of [[modern art]] to which Bernard had contributed.

==Biography==
[[File:Lautrecx07.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;''Émile Bernard''&lt;br&gt;by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] (1886)&lt;/center&gt;]]
{{For|a timeline|Émile Bernard chronology}}
Émile Henri Bernard was born in Lille, France in 1868. As in his younger years his sister was sick, Émile was unable to receive much attention from his parents; he therefore stayed with his grandmother, who owned a laundry in Lille, employing more than twenty people. She was one of the greatest supporters of his art. The family moved to Paris in 1878, where Émile attended the ''Collège Sainte-Barbe.''

===Education===

He began his studies at the [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|École des Arts Décoratifs]]. In 1884, joined the [[Atelier Cormon]] where he experimented with [[impressionism]] and [[pointillism]] and befriended fellow artists [[Louis Anquetin]] and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. After being suspended from the École des Beaux-Arts for "showing expressive tendencies in his paintings", he toured [[Brittany]] on foot, where he was enamored by the tradition and landscape.

In August 1886, Bernard met Gauguin in [[Pont-Aven]]. In this brief meeting, they exchanged little about art, but looked forward to meeting again. Bernard said, looking back on that time, that "my own talent was already fully developed." He believed that his style did play a considerable part in the development of Gauguin's mature style.

===1887–1888===

Bernard spent September 1887 at the coast, where he painted ''La Grandmère'', a portrait of his grandmother. He continued talking with other painters and started saying good things about Gauguin. Bernard went back to Paris, attended [[Académie Julian]], &lt;ref&gt;Russell, John. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D61E30F93AA25750C0A96F948260 "An Art School That Also Taught Life,"] ''New York Times.'' 19 March 1989&lt;/ref&gt;  met with van Gogh, who as we already stated was impressed by his work, found a restaurant to show the work alongside van Gogh, Anquetin, and Toulouse-Lautrec's work at the Avenue Clichy. Van Gogh called the group the School of Petit-Boulevard.

One year later, Bernard set out for Pont-Aven by foot and saw Gauguin. Their friendship and artistic relationship grew strong quickly. By this time Bernard had developed many theories about his artwork and what he wanted it to be. He stated that he had "a desire to [find] an art that would be of the most extreme simplicity and that would be accessible to all, so as not to practice its individuality, but collectively..." Gauguin was impressed by Bernard's ability to verbalize his ideas.

1888 was a seminal year in the history of [[Modern art]]. From 23 October until 23 December [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] worked together in [[Arles]]. Gauguin had brought his new style from [[Pont-Aven]] exemplified in ''[[Vision After the Sermon|Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel]]'', a powerful work of visual symbolism of which he had already sent a sketch to van Gogh in September.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
He also brought along Bernard's ''Le Pardon de Pont-Aven'' which he had exchanged for one of his paintings and which he used to decorate the shared workshop.
[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/07/26/badorment26.xml&amp;sSheet=/arts/2005/07/26/ixartright.html see in:] (ref. Druick 2001) This work was equally striking and illustrative of the style Émile Bernard had already acquainted van Gogh with when he sent him a batch of drawings in August, so much so that van Gogh made a [[watercolor]] copy of the ''Pardon'' (December 1888) which he sent to his [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|brother]], to recommend Bernard's new style to be promoted. The following year van Gogh still vividly remembered the painting in his written portrait of Émile Bernard in a letter to his sister Wil (10 December 1889):"...it was so original I absolutely wanted to have a copy."

Bernard's style was effective and coherent (see:[http://www.ackland.org/tours/classes/bernard.html woman at haystacks],) as can also be seen from the comparison of the two "portraits" Bernard and Gauguin sent to van Gogh at the end of September 1888 at the latter's request: self-portraits -at Gauguin's initiative- each integrating a small portrait of the other in the background. (ref. Druick 2001)

One of Émile Bernard's drawings from the August batch ("...a lane of trees near the sea with two women talking in the foreground and some strollers" – Vincent van Gogh in a letter to Bernard – Arles 1888) also appears to have inspired the work van Gogh and Gauguin did on the Allée des [[Alyscamps]] in Arles.

In 1891 he joined a group of [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolist]] painters that included Odilon Redon and Ferdinand Hodler.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} In 1893 he started traveling, to Egypt, Spain and Italy and after that his style became more [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]]. He returned to Paris in 1904 and remained there for the remainder of his life. He taught at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] before he died in 1941.

::"[...] this creative, [[avant-garde]] young man destroyed himself in a fight against that same avant-garde he had helped to create. His rivalry with Gauguin led him out of spite along a different path: classicism. This change took place when he was living in the Middle East, in a period of great crisis. But the fact remains that the young Bernard played an essential part as an initiator for Gauguin, and that he was the inventor of a new artistic vision."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

==Theories on style and art: Cloisonnism and Symbolism==
[[File:Affiche Volpini.jpg|thumb|Poster of the 1889 Exhibition of Paintings by the [[Impressionist]] and [[Synthetism|Synthetist Group]], at Café des Arts, known as [[The Volpini Exhibition, 1889]].]]
Bernard theorized a style of painting with bold forms separated by dark contours which became known as [[cloisonnism]]. His work showed geometric tendencies which hinted at influences of [[Paul Cézanne]], and he collaborated with [[Paul Gauguin]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]].

Many say that it was Bernard's friend Anquetin, who should receive the credit for this "closisonisme" technique. During the spring of 1887, Bernard and Anquetin "turned against Neo-Impressionism."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} It is also likely that Bernard was influenced by the works he had seen of Cézanne. But Bernard says "When I was in Brittany, I was inspired by "everything that is superfluous in a spectacle is covering it with reality and occupying our eyes instead of our mind. You have to simplify the spectacle in order to make some sense of it. You have, in a way, to draw its plan." {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

"The first means that I use is to simplify nature to an extreme point. I reduce the lines only to the main contrasts and I reduce the colors to the seven fundamental colors of the prism. To see a style and not an item. To highlight the abstract sense and not the objective.
And the second means were to appeal to the conception and to the memory by extracting yourself from any direct atmosphere. Appeal more to internal memory and conception. There I was expressing myself more, it was me that I was describing, although I was in front of the nature. There was an invisible meaning under the mute shape of exteriority."{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Symbolism and religious motifs appear in both Bernard and Gauguin's work. During the summer of 1889, Bernard was alone in Le Pouldu and began to paint many religious canvasses. He was upset that he had to do commercial work at the same time that he wanted to create these pieces.
Bernard wrote about his relationship with the style of symbolism in many letters, articles, and statements. He said that it was of a Christian essence, divine language. Bernard believed that it "It is the invisible express by the visible,"{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} and those previous attempts of religious symbolism failed. That period of symbolism represented the nature of beauty, but did not find the truth in the beauty. Art until the renaissance was based on the invisible rather than the visible, the idea, not the shapes or concrete. The history of the painting of symbols was spiritual. Everything, meaning symbols, were forgotten with the paganist ideas and doctrines. That is what Bernard was attempting to accomplish with the rebirth of symbolism in 1890. In his idea of the new symbolism, he concentrated on maintaining a grounded art, more authentic in Bernard's mind meant reducing impressionism, not creating an optical trip like [[Georges-Pierre Seurat]], but simplifying the actual symbol.

His concept was that through ideas, not technique, the truth is found.

==Influence==
It was always Émile Bernard's great frustration that Paul Gauguin never mentioned him as an influence on pictorial symbolism (see for instance his own notes attached to the Belgian edition (1942) of his selected letters, published shortly after his death). In 2001/2002 [[The Art Institute of Chicago]] and the [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam held a joint exhibition:[http://www.artic.edu/aic/exhibitions/vangogh/slide_intro.html Van Gogh and Gauguin:The Workshop of the South] that put Émile Bernard's contribution in perspective. (ref. Druick 2001)

One of Émile Bernard's students was the Swedish painter [[Ivan Aguéli]].

===Letters===
His correspondence with other artists is of great art historical interest. Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Bernard traded ideas and art. Many [[The Letters of Vincent van Gogh|letters sent from van Gogh]] and Gauguin to Bernard give historians a better idea of the artists lives and connection to their artwork.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1173">'''État second''' ([[French language|French]] for ''Second State'') refers to the state of mind into which some writers go when writing short stories. It mixes abstraction and concentration at the same time, ironically telling sometimes more facts than in conscious writing. The Argentine writer [[Julio Cortázar]] often used this method to write, as he called it "the moment of maximum creativity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://triangulaciones2850.blogspot.com/2006_07_01_archive.html
