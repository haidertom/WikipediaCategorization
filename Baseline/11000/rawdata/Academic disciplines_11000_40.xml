'''Ammonia''' is a [[chemical compound|compound]] of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The simplest [[pnictogen hydride]], ammonia is a colourless [[gas]] with a characteristic pungent smell. It is a common [[Metabolic waste#Nitrogen wastes|nitrogenous waste]], particularly among aquatic organisms, and it contributes significantly to the [[nutrition]]al needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to [[food]] and [[fertilizer]]s. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many [[pharmaceuticals|pharmaceutical products]] and is used in many commercial cleaning products. It is mainly collected by downward displacement of both air and water. Ammonia is named for the Ammonians, worshipers of the [[Egyptian god]] [[Amun]], who used [[ammonium chloride]] in their rituals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/environmental/html/ammonia.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Although common in nature and in wide use, ammonia is both [[Caustic (substance)|caustic]] and [[hazard]]ous in its concentrated form. It is classified as an [[List of extremely hazardous substances|extremely hazardous substance]] in the United States, and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.&lt;ref name="gov-right-know"&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] | title = 40 C.F.R.: Appendix A to Part 355—The List of Extremely Hazardous Substances and Their Threshold Planning Quantities | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/pdf/40cfr355AppA.pdf | edition = 1 July 2008 | accessdate = 29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global industrial production of ammonia in 2014 was 176 million tonnes,&lt;ref name=USGS2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/2016/mcs2016.pdf |title=pg. 119 – Nitrogen |publisher=[[USGS]] |year=2016 |format=PDF |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 16% increase over the 2006 global industrial production of 152 million tonnes.&lt;ref name=USGS2016-ds140&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/historical-statistics/ds140-nitro.xlsx |title=Nitrogen |publisher=[[USGS]] |year=2016 |format=PDF |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial ammonia is sold either as [[ammonia liquor]] (usually 28% ammonia in water) or as pressurized or refrigerated anhydrous liquid ammonia transported in tank cars or cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[R. Norris Shreve]]|author2=[[Joseph Brink]]|title=Chemical Process Industries |date=1977|isbn=0-07-057145-7|page=276|edition=4th}} See also [[Gas carrier]] and [[Bottled gas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; boils at {{convert|−33.34|°C|°F|3}} at a pressure of one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]], so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature. Household ammonia or [[ammonium hydroxide]] is a solution of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in water. The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the [[Baumé scale]] ([[density]]), with 26 degrees baumé (about 30% (by weight) ammonia at {{convert|15.5|°C|°F|disp=or}}) being the typical high-concentration commercial product.&lt;ref name=LaRoche&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airgasspecialtyproducts.com/UserFiles/laroche/PDF/AAPhysical.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127011850/http://www.airgasspecialtyproducts.com/UserFiles/laroche/PDF/AAPhysical.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2007 |title=Ammonium hydroxide physical properties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
Ammonia is a chemical found in trace quantities in nature, being produced from nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, whereas [[ammonium chloride]] ([[sal ammoniac]]), and [[ammonium sulfate]] are found in volcanic districts; crystals of [[ammonium bicarbonate]] have been found in [[Patagonia]]n [[guano]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}} The [[kidney]]s secrete ammonia to neutralize excess acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10360635|year=1999|author1=Kirschbaum, B |author2=Sica, D |author3=Anderson, F. P. |title=Urine electrolytes and the urine anion and osmolar gaps.|volume=133|issue=6|pages=597–604|issn=0022-2143|journal=The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine|doi=10.1016/S0022-2143(99)90190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater.

Ammonia is also found throughout the [[Solar System]] on [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Pluto]], among other places: on smaller, icy planets such as Pluto, ammonia can act as a geologically important antifreeze, as a mixture of water and ammonia can have a melting point as low as {{convert|173|K|C F}} if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such planets to retain internal oceans and active geology at a far lower temperature than would be possible with water alone.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Francis Patrick (1938) [http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/eb/supp/3646/index.pdf Tables of the properties of aqua-ammonia solutions. Part 1 of The Thermodynamics of Absorption Refrigeration]. Lehigh University studies. Science and technology series&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q4/an-ammonia-water-slurry-may-swirl-below-plutos-icy-surface.html An ammonia-water slurry may swirl below Pluto's icy surface]. Purdue University (9 November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Substances containing ammonia, or those that are similar to it, are called ''ammoniacal''.

==Properties==
Ammonia is a colourless [[gas]] with a characteristic pungent smell. It is [[lighter than air]], its density being 0.589 times that of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. It is easily liquefied due to the strong [[hydrogen bond]]ing between molecules; the [[liquid]] boils at {{convert|-33.3|°C|°F|2}}, and freezes at {{convert|-77.7|°C|°F|2}} to white crystals.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}}

Ammonia may be conveniently deodorized by reacting it with either sodium bicarbonate or [[acetic acid]]. Both of these reactions form an odourless ammonium salt.

;Solid: The crystal symmetry is cubic, [[Pearson symbol]] cP16, [[space group]] P2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;3 No.198, lattice constant 0.5125&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0567739479001340|title=The crystal structure of deuteroammonia between 2 and 180 K by neutron powder profile refinement|year=1979|last1=Hewat|first1=A. W.|last2=Riekel|first2=C.|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A|volume=35|issue=4|page=569|bibcode = 1979AcCrA..35..569H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Liquid: [[Liquid]] ammonia possesses strong [[ion]]ising powers reflecting its high [[Dielectric constant|ε]] of 22. Liquid ammonia has a very high [[Enthalpy of vaporization|standard enthalpy change of vaporization]] (23.35&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|kJ]]/mol, ''cf.'' [[Properties of water|water]] 40.65&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, methane 8.19&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, [[phosphine]] 14.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) and can therefore be used in laboratories in uninsulated vessels without additional refrigeration. See [[#Liquid ammonia as a solvent|liquid ammonia as a solvent]].

;Solvent properties: Ammonia is [[Miscibility|miscible]] with water. In an aqueous solution, it can be expelled by boiling. The [[water|aqueous]] solution of ammonia is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] solution) has a [[density]] of 0.880 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is often known as '.880 ammonia'. Ammonia does not burn readily or sustain [[combustion]], except under narrow fuel-to-air mixtures of 15–25% air.

;Combustion: When mixed with [[oxygen]], it burns with a pale yellowish-green flame. At high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst, ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements. Ignition occurs when [[chlorine]] is passed into ammonia, forming nitrogen and [[hydrogen chloride]]; if chlorine is present in excess, then the highly explosive [[nitrogen trichloride]] (NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also formed.

===Structure===
The ammonia molecule has a [[Trigonal pyramid (chemistry)|trigonal pyramidal]] shape as predicted by the [[valence shell electron pair repulsion theory]] (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7°.&lt;ref name="CRC 94th"&gt;{{cite book | editor= Haynes, William M. | year = 2013 | title = [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]] | edition = 94th | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | isbn = 9781466571143|pages=9–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one lone pair of electrons. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5°, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7°.&lt;ref name="CRC 94th"/&gt; The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a [[Lone pair|lone electron pair]], which makes ammonia a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a [[dipole]] moment and makes it [[Polar molecule|polar]]. The molecule's polarity, and especially, its ability to form [[hydrogen bond]]s, makes ammonia highly miscible with water. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are [[Protonation|protonated]]. Temperature and [[salinity]] also affect the proportion of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The latter has the shape of a regular [[tetrahedron]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with [[methane]].

The ammonia molecule readily undergoes [[nitrogen inversion]] at room temperature; a useful analogy is an [[umbrella]] turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the [[resonance frequency]] is 23.79 [[Hertz|GHz]], corresponding to [[microwave]] radiation of a [[wavelength]] of 1.260&amp;nbsp;cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first [[Microwave spectroscopy|microwave spectrum]] to be observed.&lt;ref name="Cleeton"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.45.234|title=Electromagnetic Waves of {{convert|1.1|cm|0|abbr=on}}. Wave-Length and the Absorption Spectrum of Ammonia|year=1934|author=Cleeton, C. E.|journal=Physical Review|volume=45|issue=4|pages=234|first2=N. H.|last2=Williams|bibcode = 1934PhRv...45..234C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphotericity===
One of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its [[basicity]]. Ammonia is considered to be a weak base. It combines with [[acid]]s to form [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s; thus with [[hydrochloric acid]] it forms [[ammonium chloride]] (sal ammoniac); with [[nitric acid]], [[ammonium nitrate]], etc. Perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry [[hydrogen chloride]]; moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Influence of moisture on chemical change|author=Baker, H. B. |year=1894|journal=J. Chem. Soc.|volume=65|pages= 611–624|doi=10.1039/CT8946500611}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a demonstration experiment, opened bottles of concentrated ammonia and hydrochloric acid produce clouds of ammonium chloride, which seem to appear "out of nothing" as the salt forms where the two diffusing clouds of molecules meet, somewhere between the two bottles.
:NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl

The salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the [[:Category:Ammonium compounds|ammonium salts]] and all contain the [[ammonium|ammonium ion]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}}

Although ammonia is well known as a weak base, it can also act as an extremely weak acid. It is a protic substance and is capable of formation of amides (which contain the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion). For example, [[lithium]] dissolves in liquid ammonia to give a solution of [[lithium amide]]:

: 2Li + 2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2LiNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Self-dissociation===
Like water, ammonia undergoes [[molecular autoionisation]] to form its [[conjugate acid|acid and base conjugates]]:
:2 {{chem|NH|3}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{chem|NH|4|+}} (aq) + {{chem|NH|2|-}} (aq)

Ammonia often functions as a [[weak base]], so it has some [[buffer solution|buffering]] ability. Shifts in pH will cause more or fewer [[ammonium]] cations ({{chem|NH|4|+}}) and amide anions ({{chem|NH|2|-}}) to be present in [[solution]]. At standard pressure and temperature, K=[{{chem|NH|4|+}}][{{chem|NH|2|-}}] = 10{{su|p=−30}}

===Combustion===
The combustion of ammonia to nitrogen and water is [[exothermic]]:
: 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (''g'') [[Standard enthalpy of reaction|Δ''H''°&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;]] = −1267.20 kJ/mol (or −316.8 kJ/mol if expressed per mol of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)

The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], Δ''H''°&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, expressed per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of ammonia and with condensation of the water formed, is −382.81&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. Dinitrogen is the thermodynamic product of combustion: all [[nitrogen oxide]]s are unstable with respect to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the principle behind the [[catalytic converter]]. Nitrogen oxides can be formed as kinetic products in the presence of appropriate catalysts, a reaction of great industrial importance in the production of [[nitric acid]]:
:4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 NO + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

A subsequent reaction leads to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:2 NO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst (such as [[platinum]] gauze or warm [[chromium(III) oxide]]), because the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammonia–air mixture. The flammable range of ammonia in air is 16–25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of other compounds===
In [[organic chemistry]], ammonia can act as a [[nucleophile]] in [[Nucleophilic substitution|substitution]] reactions. [[Amine]]s can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with [[alkyl halide]]s, although the resulting -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution and neutralises the [[hydrogen halide]] formed. [[Methylamine]] is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with [[chloromethane]], and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare [[racemic]] [[alanine]] in 70% yield. [[Ethanolamine]] is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with [[ethylene oxide]]: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce [[diethanolamine]] and [[triethanolamine]].

[[Amide]]s can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives. [[Acyl chloride]]s are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the [[hydrogen chloride]] formed. [[Ester]]s and [[anhydride]]s also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be [[Dehydration|dehydrated]] to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150–200&amp;nbsp;°C are required.

The hydrogen in ammonia is capable of replacement by [[metal]]s; thus, [[magnesium]] burns in the gas with the formation of [[magnesium nitride]] Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and when the gas is passed over heated [[sodium]] or [[potassium]], sodamide, NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and potassamide, KNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are formed.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}} Where necessary in [[IUPAC nomenclature|substitutive nomenclature]], [[IUPAC]] recommendations prefer the name "azane" to ammonia: hence [[chloramine]] would be named "chloroazane" in substitutive nomenclature, not "chloroammonia".

Pentavalent ammonia is known as λ&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-amine, or more commonly, ammonium hydride. This crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions. This substance was once investigated as a possible solid rocket fuel in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0373800|title=High pressure chemistry of hydrogenous fuels|author1=Sterrett, K.

=== Ammonia as a ligand ===
{{main|Metal ammine complex}}
[[File:Tetraamminediaquacopper(II)-3D-balls.png|thumb|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of the tetraamminediaquacopper(II) cation, [Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]]
Ammonia can act as a [[ligand]] in [[transition metal]] [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]]. It is a pure σ-donor, in the middle of the [[spectrochemical series]], and shows intermediate [[HSAB concept|hard-soft]] behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named '''ammine''' in the nomenclature of [[coordination compound]]s. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) ([Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper(II) salts. Tetraamminediaquacopper(II) hydroxide is known as [[Schweizer's reagent]], and has the remarkable ability to dissolve [[cellulose]]. Diamminesilver(I) ([Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is the active species in [[Tollens' reagent]]. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: [[silver chloride]] (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, [[silver bromide]] (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution, whereas [[silver iodide]] (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia.

Ammine complexes of [[chromium]](III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of [[Alfred Werner]]'s revolutionary theory on the structure of coordination compounds. Werner noted only two isomers (''fac''- and ''mer''-) of the complex [CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] could be formed, and concluded the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the [[wikt:vertex|vertices]] of an [[octahedron]]. This proposal has since been confirmed by [[X-ray crystallography]].

An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare. One example is the [[Mercury(I) chloride|Calomel reaction]], where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.
:Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Hg + HgCl(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

==Detection and determination==
{{about|section=true|detection in the laboratory|detection in astronomy|#In astronomy}}

===Ammonia in solution===
{{main|Ammonia solution}}
Ammonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected, in very minute traces, by the addition of [[Nessler's solution]], which gives a distinct yellow colouration in the presence of the slightest trace of ammonia or ammonium salts. The amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with [[sodium hydroxide|sodium]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard [[sulfuric acid]] and the excess of acid then determined [[volumetric analysis|volumetrically]]; or the ammonia may be absorbed in [[hydrochloric acid]] and the ammonium chloride so formed precipitated as [[ammonium hexachloroplatinate]], (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=863}}

===Gaseous ammonia===
[[Sulfur sticks]] are burnt to detect small leaks in industrial ammonia refrigeration systems. Larger quantities can be detected by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=863}} Ammonia is an irritant and irritation increases with concentration; the [[permissible exposure limit]] is 25&amp;nbsp;ppm, and lethal above 500&amp;nbsp;ppm.&lt;ref&gt;(OSHA) Source: Sax,  N.

===Ammoniacal nitrogen (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N)===
[[Ammoniacal nitrogen]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N) is a measure commonly used for testing the quantity of [[ammonium]] ions, derived naturally from ammonia, and returned to ammonia via organic processes, in water or waste liquids. It is a measure used mainly for quantifying values in waste treatment and water purification systems, as well as a measure of the health of natural and man-made water reserves. It is measured in units of mg/L ([[milligram]] per [[litre]]).

The ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] mentioned that there were [[outcrop]]s of salt in an area of Libya that was inhabited by a people called the "Ammonians" (now:  the [[Siwa oasis]] in northwestern Egypt, where salt lakes still exist).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus with George Rawlinson, trans., ''The History of Herodotus'' (New York, New York:  Tandy-Thomas Co., 1909), vol.2, Book 4, § 181, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x004090527;view=1up;seq=330 pp. 304–305.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The land of the Ammonians is mentioned elsewhere in Herodotus' ''History'' and in [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias']] ''Description of Greece'':

In the form of sal ammoniac ''(نشادر, nushadir)'' ammonia was important to the [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Muslim alchemists]] as early as the 8th century, first mentioned by the Persian-Arab chemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]],&lt;ref name="Haq1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haq|first=Syed Nomanul|title=Names, Natures and Things: The Alchemist Jabir Ibn Hayyan and His Kitab Al-Ahjar (Book of Stones)|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P-70YjP0nj8C|accessdate=22 June 2010|date=28 February 1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-3254-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the European [[Alchemy|alchemists]] since the 13th century, being mentioned by [[Albertus Magnus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}} It was also used by [[dye]]rs in the [[Middle Ages]] in the form of fermented [[urine]] to alter the colour of vegetable dyes.

The ammonia was used to produce explosives to sustain war efforts.&lt;ref name="Conquering" &gt;{{cite book|author=Smith, Roland|title=Conquering Chemistry|year=2001|isbn=0-07-470146-0|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the availability of natural gas, hydrogen as a precursor to [[ammonia production]] was produced via the [[electrolysis]] of water or using the [[chloralkali process]].

With the advent of the steel industry in the 20th century, ammonia became a byproduct of the production of coking coal.

==Uses==

===Fertilizer===
Globally, approximately 88% (as of 2014) of ammonia is used as fertilizers either as its salts, solutions or anhydrously.&lt;ref name="USGS2016"/&gt; When applied to soil, it helps provide increased yields of crops such as maize and wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lassaletta|first1=Luis|last2=Billen|first2=Gilles|last3=Grizzetti|first3=Bruna|last4=Anglade|first4=Juliette|last5=Garnier|first5=Josette|title=50 year trends in nitrogen use efficiency of world cropping systems: the relationship between yield and nitrogen input to cropland|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=2014|volume=9|issue=10|pages=105011|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/9/10/105011|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/9/10/105011/meta|language=en|issn=1748-9326|bibcode=2014ERL.....9j5011L}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30% of agricultural nitrogen applied in the USA is in the form of anhydrous ammonia and worldwide 110 million tonnes are applied each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/anhydrous-ammonia-fertilizer-abundant-important-hazardous/2013/04/18/c2d4c69c-a85a-11e2-a8e2-5b98cb59187f_story.html|title=Anhydrous ammonia fertilizer:  abundant, important, hazardous|publisher=Washington Post|author=David Brown|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursor to nitrogenous compounds===
Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. An important derivative is [[nitric acid]]. This key material is generated via the [[Ostwald process]] by [[oxidation]] of ammonia with air over a [[platinum]] catalyst at {{convert|700|–|850|°C}}, ~9 atm. [[Nitric oxide]] is an intermediate in this conversion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Holleman, A. F. |author2=Wiberg, E. |title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Academic Press|location= San Diego|year=2001|isbn=0-12-352651-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Nitric acid is used for the production of [[fertilizer]]s, [[explosive]]s, and many organonitrogen compounds.

Ammonia is also used to make the following compounds:
* [[Hydrazine]], in the [[Olin Raschig process]] and the [[peroxide process]]
* [[Hydrogen cyanide]], in the [[BMA process]] and the [[Andrussow process]]
* [[Hydroxylamine]] and [[ammonium carbonate]], in the [[Raschig process]]
* [[Phenol]], in the [[Raschig–Hooker process]]
* [[Urea]], in the [[Bosch–Meiser urea process]] and in [[Wöhler synthesis]]
* [[Amino acid]]s, using [[Strecker amino-acid synthesis]]
* [[Acrylonitrile]], in the [[Sohio process]]

Ammonia can also be used to make compounds in reactions which are not specifically named. Examples of such compounds include: [[ammonium perchlorate]], [[ammonium nitrate]], [[formamide]], [[dinitrogen tetroxide]], [[alprazolam]], [[ethanolamine]], [[ethyl carbamate]], [[hexamethylenetetramine]], and [[ammonium bicarbonate]].

===As a cleaner===
Household ammonia is a solution of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in water (i.e., [[ammonium hydroxide]]) used as a general purpose cleaner for many surfaces. Because ammonia results in a relatively streak-free shine, one of its most common uses is to clean glass, porcelain and stainless steel. It is also frequently used for cleaning ovens and soaking items to loosen baked-on grime. Household ammonia ranges in concentration by weight from 5 to 10% ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.health.ny.gov/environmental/emergency/chemical_terrorism/ammonia_tech.htm|title=The Facts About Ammonia|website=www.health.ny.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States manufacturers of cleaning products are required to provide the product's [[material safety data sheet]] which lists the concentration used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/OSHA3514.pdf|title=OSHA Hazard Communication Standard: Safety Data Sheets|last=|first=|date=|website=OSHA|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fermentation===
Solutions of ammonia ranging from 16% to 25% are used in the [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] industry as a source of nitrogen for microorganisms and to adjust pH during fermentation.

===Antimicrobial agent for food products===
As early as in 1895, it was known that ammonia was "strongly [[antiseptic]] ... it requires 1.4 grams per litre to preserve [[beef tea]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/disinfectiondisi00rideuoft|title=Disinfection and Disinfectants: An Introduction to the Study of|author=Samuel Rideal|publisher=Charles Griffin and Company|place=London|year=1895|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, anhydrous ammonia destroyed 99.999% of [[zoonotic bacteria]] in 3 types of [[compound feed|animal feed]], but not [[silage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.11.040|title=Ammonia disinfection of animal feeds — Laboratory study|author=Tajkarimi, Mehrdad|journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology|volume=122|issue= 1–2|year=2008|pages=23–28|pmid=18155794|last2=Riemann|first2=H.

Lean finely textured beef in the beef industry is made from fatty [[beef trimmings]] (c. 50–70% fat) by removing the fat using heat and [[centrifugation]], then treating it with ammonia to kill ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''. The process was deemed effective and safe by the [[US Department of Agriculture]] based on a study that found that the treatment reduces ''E. coli'' to undetectable levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/health/04meat.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Burger That Shattered Her Life | first=Michael | last=Moss | date=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been safety concerns about the process as well as consumer complaints about the taste and smell of beef treated at optimal levels of ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/us/31meat.html | work=The New York Times | title=Safety of Beef Processing Method Is Questioned | first=Michael | last=Moss | date=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of ammonia in any final product has not come close to toxic levels to humans.

===Minor and emerging uses===

====Refrigeration – R717====
Because of ammonia's vaporization properties, it is a useful [[refrigerant]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; It was commonly used before the popularisation of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (Freons). Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its high [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] and low cost. It suffers from the disadvantage of toxicity, which restricts its domestic and small-scale use. Along with its use in modern [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in [[absorption refrigerator]]s. The [[Kalina cycle]], which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants, depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia–water mixture. Ammonia coolant is also used in the S1 radiator aboard the [[International Space Station]] in two loops which are used to regulate the internal temperature and enable temperature dependent experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/cooling-system-keeps-space-station-safe-productive|title=Cooling System Keeps Space Station Safe, Productive|last=Wright|first=Jerry|date=2015-04-13|work=NASA|access-date=2017-07-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/21059-space-station-cooling-system-explained-infographic.html|title=International Space Station's Cooling System: How It Works (Infographic)|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential importance of ammonia as a refrigerant has increased with the discovery that vented CFCs and HFCs are extremely potent and stable greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Reducing Hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) Use and Emissions in the Federal Sector through SNAP|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-12/documents/epa_hfc_federal_sector.pdf|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contribution to the greenhouse effect of CFCs and HFCs in current use, if vented, would match that of all CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.

====For remediation of gaseous emissions====
Ammonia is used to scrub SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the burning of fossil fuels, and the resulting product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer. Ammonia neutralizes the nitrogen oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) pollutants emitted by diesel engines. This technology, called SCR ([[selective catalytic reduction]]), relies on a [[vanadia]]-based catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2008/db20080321_748642_page_3.htm |title=Diesel: Greener Than You Think}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ammonia may be used to mitigate gaseous spills of [[phosgene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | title = Phosgene: Health and Safety Guide | year = 1998 | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/hsg/hsg/hsg106.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== As a fuel ====
[[File:AmmoniacalGasEngineStreetcarARWaud.jpeg|thumb|Ammoniacal Gas Engine [[Streetcars in New Orleans|Streetcar in New Orleans]] drawn by [[Alfred Waud]] in 1871.]]
[[File:x-15.jpg|thumb|The [[X-15]] [[aircraft]] used ammonia as one component [[fuel]] of its [[rocket]] [[engine]] ]]
The raw [[energy density]] of liquid ammonia is 11.5 MJ/L,&lt;ref name="Lan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lan|first=Rong|last2=Tao|first2=Shanwen|date=28 August 2014|title=Ammonia as a suitable fuel for fuel cells|journal=Frontiers in Energy Research|volume=2|pages=35|doi=10.3389/fenrg.2014.00035}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is about a third that of [[diesel fuel|diesel]]. Although it can be used as a fuel, for a number of reasons this has never been common or widespread. In addition to direct utilization of ammonia as a fuel in combustion engines, there is also the opportunity to convert ammonia back to hydrogen, where it can be used to power hydrogen fuel cells or directly within high-temperature fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giddey|first1=S.|last2=Badwal|first2=S.

Ammonia engines or ammonia motors, using ammonia as a [[working fluid]], have been proposed and occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  |author=Douglas Self 
  |authorlink=Douglas Self 
  |url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/ammonia/ammonia.htm |title=Ammonia Motors |date=1 October 2007  |accessdate=28 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is similar to that used in a [[fireless locomotive]], but with ammonia as the working fluid, instead of steam or compressed air. Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] in the UK and the [[St. Charles Avenue Streetcar]] line in New Orleans in the 1870s and 1880s,&lt;ref name="The Streetcars of New Orleans"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Streetcars of New Orleans |author=Louis C. Hennick |author2=Elbridge Harper Charlton |date = 1965 |issue = |volume = |publisher =Pelican Publishing |isbn=9781455612598 |pages =14–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and during [[World War II]] ammonia was used to power buses in Belgium.&lt;ref name=c1/&gt;

Ammonia is sometimes proposed as a practical alternative to [[fossil fuel]] for [[internal combustion engine]]s.&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/2007/Olson2_NH3.pdf |title=Ammonia as a Transportation Fuel IV |date=15–16 October 2007 |publisher=Norm Olson – Iowa Energy Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207092554/http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/2007/Olson2_NH3.pdf |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its high [[octane rating]] of 120&lt;ref name="Chemistry department, University of Bristol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/ammonia/Ammonia%20MOTM.htm|title=Ammonia|publisher=chm.bris.ac.uk|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low flame temperature allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high NOx production.&amp;nbsp; Since ammonia contains no carbon, its combustion cannot produce carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or soot.

However ammonia cannot be easily used in existing [[Otto cycle]] engines because of its very narrow [[Ammonia#Combustion|flammability range]], and there are also other barriers to widespread automobile usage.  In terms of raw ammonia supplies, plants would have to be built to increase production levels, requiring significant capital and energy sources.  Although it is the second most produced chemical, the scale of ammonia production is a small fraction of world petroleum usage.  It could be manufactured from renewable energy sources, as well as coal or nuclear power. The 60 MW [[Norsk Hydro Rjukan|Rjukan dam]] in [[Telemark]], Norway produced ammonia for many years from 1913, providing fertilizer for much of Europe.

Despite this, several tests have been done. In 1981, a Canadian company converted a 1981 Chevrolet Impala to operate using ammonia as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|L0hBAz6MxC4|Ammonia Powered Car}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregvezina.ca |title=Watch 'Ammonia Fuel'|accessdate=7 July 2009|publisher=Greg Vezina}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a University of Michigan pickup powered by ammonia drove from Detroit to San Francisco as part of a demonstration, requiring only one fill-up in Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nh3car.com/|title=Welcome to NH3 Car|work=NH3Car.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to [[hydrogen as a fuel]], ammonia is much more energy efficient, and hydrogen could be produced, stored, and delivered at a much lower cost as ammonia rather than as compressed and/or cryogenic hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; The conversion of ammonia to hydrogen via the sodium-amide process,&lt;ref name="American Chemical Society"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=William I.

Conversion to hydrogen would allow the storage of hydrogen at nearly 18 wt% compared to ~5% for gaseous hydrogen under pressure.

Rocket engines have also been fueled by ammonia. The [[Reaction Motors XLR99]] rocket engine that powered the {{nowrap|[[X-15]]}} hypersonic research aircraft used liquid ammonia. Although not as powerful as other fuels, it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine, and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidizer, liquid oxygen, which simplified the aircraft's design.

====As a stimulant====
[[File:Meth ammonia tank Otley iowa.JPG|thumb|Anti-[[methamphetamine|meth]] sign on tank of anhydrous ammonia, [[Otley, Iowa]]. Anhydrous ammonia is a common farm fertilizer that is also a critical ingredient in making methamphetamine. In 2005, Iowa used grant money to give out thousands of locks to prevent criminals from getting into the tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thegazette.com/2009/10/06/anhydrous-ammonia-tank-locks-have-flaws |title=Anhydrous ammonia tank locks have flaws|author=The Gazette Staff|newspaper=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ammonia, as the vapor released by [[smelling salts]], has found significant use as a respiratory stimulant.  Ammonia is commonly used in the illegal manufacture of [[methamphetamine]] through a [[Birch reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html |title=Illinois Attorney General &amp;#124; Basic Understanding Of Meth |publisher=Illinoisattorneygeneral.gov |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Birch method of making methamphetamine is dangerous because the alkali metal and liquid ammonia are both extremely reactive, and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnZ23IqU4SoC&amp;pg=PA759&amp;lpg=PA759&amp;dq=ammonia+birch+method+danger&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Di9oxSFGO9&amp;sig=EeM1TNcWDbgY606dsTcn4H8rmnk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-ue6Twd_YAhXmSN8KHdSmDQ4Q6AEIZjAN#v=onepage&amp;q=ammonia%20birch%20method%20danger&amp;f=false|title=Occupational, Industrial, and Environmental Toxicology|last=Greenberg|first=Michael I.|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0323013406|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Textile====
Liquid ammonia is used for treatment of cotton materials, giving properties like [[mercerisation]], using alkalis. In particular, it is used for prewashing of wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Włochowicz|first1=A.|last2=Stelmasiak|first2=E.|title=Change in thermal properties of wool after treatment with liquid ammonia|journal=Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry|volume=26|issue=1|year=1983|page=17|doi=10.1007/BF01914084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lifting gas====
At standard temperature and pressure, ammonia is less dense than atmosphere and has approximately 45-48% of the lifting power of hydrogen or [[helium]]. Ammonia has sometimes been used to fill weather balloons as a [[lifting gas]]. Because of its relatively high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an [[airship]] to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).

====Woodworking====
{{see also|Ammonia fuming}}
Ammonia has been used to darken quartersawn white oak in Arts &amp; Crafts and Mission-style furniture. Ammonia fumes react with the natural tannins in the wood and cause it to change colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Fuming_white_oak.html Fuming white oak]. woodweb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy carrier====
Ammonia can be manufactured from solar energy, air and water. This is an efficient way to package hydrogen into a chemical that is much cheaper to store and transport than pure hydrogen be it as gas or as liquid. In fact, per volume ammonia holds more hydrogen than does liquid hydrogen. Ammonia may be the key to overcome not only the daily but also the seasonal fluctuations of renewable energy sources.

This approach will solve many of the problems foreseen for the proposed [[Hydrogen economy]], that instead could be replaced by an Ammonia economy, essentially still a hydrogen economy.

In early August 2018, scientists from [[Australia]]’s [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) announced the success of developing a process to release hydrogen from ammonia and harvest that at ultra-high purity as a fuel for cars. This uses a special membrane. Two demonstration [[fuel cell vehicle]]s have the technology, a [[Hyundai Nexo]] and [[Toyota Mirai]].&lt;ref name="2018-08-08_ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-08/hydrogen-fuel-breakthrough-csiro-game-changer-export-potential/10082514  'Carbon-free fuel': Australian hydrogen car breakthrough could go global], Lexy Hamilton-Smith, [[ABC News Online]], 2018-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale, intermittent production of ammonia, for local agricultural use, may be a viable substitute for electrical grid attachment as a sink for power generated by wind turbines in isolated rural installations.

==Safety precautions==
[[File:Ammiakoprovod NS.jpg|thumb|The world's longest ammonia [[pipeline transport|pipeline]], running from the [[TogliattiAzot]] plant in [[Russia]] to [[Odessa]] in [[Ukraine]].]]
The U. S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] has set a 15-minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of 35 ppm by volume in the environmental air and an 8-hour exposure limit of 25 ppm by volume.&lt;ref name=ToxFaqSheet&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts126.pdf |title=Toxic FAQ Sheet for Ammonia| publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR)|date= September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH recently reduced the IDLH from 500 to 300 based on recent more conservative interpretations of original research in 1943. IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) is the level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes without suffering irreversible health effects. Other organizations have varying exposure levels. U.S. Navy Standards [U.S. Bureau of Ships 1962] maximum allowable concentrations (MACs):continuous exposure (60 days): 25 ppm / 1 hour: 400 ppm&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/7664417.html Ammonia], IDLH Documentation&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia vapour has a sharp, irritating, pungent odour that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure. The average odour threshold is 5 ppm, well below any danger or damage. Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death.&lt;ref name=ToxFaqSheet/&gt; Although ammonia is regulated in the United States as a non-flammable gas, it still meets the definition of a material that is toxic by inhalation and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than 13,248 L (3,500 gallons).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/faq/anhydrous-ammonia-covered-under-hazardous-materials-safety-permit-program Is Anhydrous Ammonia covered under the Hazardous Materials Safety Permit Program?] from the website of the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT)&lt;/ref&gt; Household products containing ammonia (i.e., [[Windex]]) should never be used in conjunction with products containing bleach, as the resulting chemical reaction produces highly toxic fumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/toxicchemicals/a/Mixing-Bleach-And-Ammonia.htm|title=Why You Shouldn't Mix Bleach and Ammonia|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid ammonia is dangerous because it is [[hygroscopic]] and because it can freeze flesh. See [[Gas carrier#Health effects of specific cargoes carried on gas carriers]] for more information.

===Toxicity===
The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals, as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is converted to [[carbamoyl phosphate]] by the enzyme [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase]], and then enters the [[urea cycle]] to be either incorporated into [[amino acid]]s or excreted in the urine.&lt;ref name="Ammonium Ion Is Converted Into Urea in Most Terrestrial Vertebrates"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=JM|last2=Tymoczko|first2=JL|last3=Stryer|first3=L|title=Biochemistry|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22450/|edition=5th|year=2002|section=23.4|}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fish]] and [[amphibian]]s lack this mechanism, as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion. Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals, and for this reason it is [[Directive 67/548/EEC|classified]] as ''dangerous for the environment''.

Ammonia is a constituent of [[tobacco smoke]].&lt;ref name="TalhoutSchulz2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Talhout|first1=Reinskje|last2=Schulz|first2=Thomas|last3=Florek|first3=Ewa|last4=Van Benthem|first4=Jan|last5=Wester|first5=Piet|last6=Opperhuizen|first6=Antoon|title=Hazardous Compounds in Tobacco Smoke|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=8|issue=12|year=2011|pages=613–628|issn=1660-4601|doi=10.3390/ijerph8020613|pmid=21556207|pmc=3084482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aquaculture ====
Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species.&lt;ref name="Water Research"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.water-research.net/index.php/ammonia-in-groundwater-runoff-and-streams|title = Ammonia in Groundwater, Runoff, and Streams|date = |accessdate = 3 December 2014|website = The Water Centre|publisher = |last = Oram|first = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At lower concentrations, around 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Managing ammonia in fish ponds|last = Hargreaves|first = J.A.|publisher = Southern Regional Aquaculture Center|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Tucker|first2 = C.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate.&lt;ref name="Water Research" /&gt; At concentrations exceeding 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death.&lt;ref name="Water Research" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sergeant"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.pollutionsolutions-online.com/articles/water-wastewater/17/chris_sergeant/the_management_of_ammonia_levels_in_an_aquaculture_environment/1557/|title = The Management of Ammonia Levels in an Aquaculture Environment|last = Sergeant|first = Chris|date = 5 February 2014|journal = Water/Wastewater|access-date = 3 December 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref name="Sergeant" /&gt;

During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish&lt;ref name="Sergeant" /&gt; and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.

===Storage information===
Similar to [[propane]], [[anhydrous]] ammonia boils below room temperature when at atmospheric pressure. A storage vessel capable of {{convert|250|psi|MPa|abbr=on|lk=on}} is suitable to contain the liquid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=3a1341f81fbe762466a07d33da2361fb;rgn=div8;view=text;node=29%3A5.1.1.1.8.8.33.11;idno=29;cc=ecfr Electronic Code of Federal Regulations:]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104165051/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr%3Bsid%3D3a1341f81fbe762466a07d33da2361fb%3Brgn%3Ddiv8%3Bview%3Dtext%3Bnode%3D29%3A5.1.1.1.8.8.33.11%3Bidno%3D29%3Bcc%3Decfr |date=4 November 2011 }}.

Retrieved on 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonium compounds should never be allowed to come in contact with [[base (chemistry)|bases]] (unless in an intended and contained reaction), as dangerous quantities of ammonia gas could be released.

===Household use===
Solutions of ammonia (5–10% by weight) are used as household cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and [[mucous membrane]]s (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin. Caution should be used that the chemical is never mixed into any liquid containing bleach, as a poisonous gas may result. Mixing with [[chlorine]]-containing products or strong oxidants, such as household [[bleach]], can lead to hazardous compounds such as [[chloramine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last =Rizk-Ouaini|first =Rosette |author2=Ferriol, Michel |author3=Gazet, Josette |author4=Saugier-Cohen Adad |author5=Marie Therese |title = Oxidation reaction of ammonia with sodium hypochlorite.

===Laboratory use of ammonia solutions===
[[File:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|Hydrochloric acid sample releasing HCl fumes, which are reacting with ammonia fumes to produce a white smoke of ammonium chloride.]]
The hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration: "dilute" ammonia solutions are usually 5–10% by weight (&lt;5.62&amp;nbsp;mol/L); "concentrated" solutions are usually prepared at &gt;25% by weight. A 25% (by weight) solution has a density of 0.907 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a solution that has a lower density will be more concentrated. The [[Directive 67/548/EEC|European Union classification]] of ammonia solutions is given in the table.

The ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract, and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood. Saturated ("0.880" — see [[#Properties]]) solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather, and the bottle should be opened with care; this is not usually a problem for 25% ("0.900") solutions.

Ammonia solutions should not be mixed with [[halogen]]s, as toxic and/or explosive products are formed. Prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with [[silver]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[iodide]] salts can also lead to explosive products: such mixtures are often formed in [[qualitative inorganic analysis]], and should be lightly acidified but not concentrated (&lt;6% w/v) before disposal once the test is completed.

===Laboratory use of anhydrous ammonia (gas or liquid)===
&lt;!-- EU index no. 007-001-00-5 --&gt;

Anhydrous ammonia is classified as toxic ('''T''') and dangerous for the environment ('''N'''). The gas is flammable ([[autoignition temperature]]: 651&amp;nbsp;°C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16–25%). The [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the United States is 50&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]] (35&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), while the [[IDLH]] concentration is estimated at 300&amp;nbsp;ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50&amp;nbsp;ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100&amp;nbsp;ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes [[copper]]- and [[zinc]]-containing [[alloy]]s, and so [[brass]] fittings should not be used for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack [[rubber]] and certain plastics.

Ammonia reacts violently with the halogens. [[Nitrogen triiodide]], a [[primary explosive|primary]] [[high explosive]], is formed when ammonia comes in contact with [[iodine]]. Ammonia causes the explosive [[polymerisation]] of [[ethylene oxide]]. It also forms explosive [[fulminating]] compounds with compounds of [[gold]], [[silver]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[germanium]] or [[tellurium]], and with [[stibine]]. Violent reactions have also been reported with [[acetaldehyde]], [[hypochlorite]] solutions, [[potassium ferricyanide]] and [[peroxide]]s.

==Synthesis and production==
{{about|section=true|industrial synthesis|synthesis in certain organisms|#Biosynthesis}}
{{See also|Haber process}}
[[File:Production of ammonia.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Production trend of ammonia between 1947 and 2007]]
Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of [[chemical plant]]s worldwide produce ammonia. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, [[ammonia production]] is a significant component of the world energy budget.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The USGS reports global ammonia production in 2014 was 176 million tonnes.&lt;ref name="USGS2016"/&gt; China accounted for 32.6% of that (increasingly from coal as part of [[urea]] synthesis), followed by Russia at 8.1%, India at 7.6%, and the United States at 6.4%.&lt;ref name="USGS2016"/&gt; About 88% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops.&lt;ref name="USGS2016"/&gt; As of 2012 the global production of ammonia produced from natural gas using the steam reforming process was 72 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ietd.iipnetwork.org/content/ammonia|title=Ammonia|date=2013-04-30|work=Industrial Efficiency Technology &amp; Measures|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of [[World War I]], most ammonia was obtained by the [[dry distillation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1918/press.html |title=Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1918) – Haber-Bosch process}}&lt;/ref&gt; of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products, including [[camel]] [[manure|dung]], where it was [[distillation|distilled]] by the reduction of [[nitrous acid]] and [[nitrite]]s with hydrogen; in addition, it was produced by the distillation of [[coal]], and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by [[alkaline]] hydroxides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=7 July 2009|title=Chemistry of the Group 2 Elements – Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1002934|publisher= BBC.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], the salt most generally used being the chloride ([[sal ammoniac]]) thus:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}}

:2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + 2 CaO → [[Calcium chloride|CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3([[Gas|g]])&lt;/sub&gt;

Hydrogen for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically by using the [[water gas]] reaction followed by the [[water gas shift]] reaction, produced by passing steam through red-hot [[coke (fuel)|coke]], to give a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases, followed by removal of the carbon dioxide "washing" the gas mixture with water under pressure ({{convert|25|atm|kPa|lk=on}});&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parkes |first1=G. D. |last2=Mellor |first2=J. W. |title=Mellor's Modern Inorganic Chemistry |edition=New Edition, Revised and Rewritten |year=1939 |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co |location=London |pages=255–256 &amp; 362}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by using other sources like coal or coke gasification.

Modern ammonia-producing plants depend on industrial [[hydrogen production]] to react with atmospheric nitrogen using a [[magnetite]] [[catalyst]] or over a promoted Fe catalyst under high pressure ({{convert|100|atm}}) and temperature (450&amp;nbsp;°C) to form anhydrous liquid ammonia. This step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop (also referred to as the [[Haber process|Haber–Bosch process]]):&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, P.W.; Overton, T.L.; Rourke, J.P.; Weller, M.T. and Armstrong, F.A. (2010) [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4Ka5HSSrR_yeENFS0hvbjdUR00/view ''Shriver and Atkins Inorganic Chemistry'']. 5th Edi. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York. p. 383. {{ISBN|978-1-42-921820-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3([[Gas|g]])&lt;/sub&gt;

Hydrogen required for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically using other sources like coal or coke gasification or less economically from the electrolysis of water into oxygen + hydrogen and other alternatives that are presently impractical for large scale.
At one time, most of Europe's ammonia was produced from the Hydro plant at [[Vemork]], via the electrolysis route. Various renewable energy electricity sources are also potentially applicable.

As a sustainable alternative to the relatively inefficient [[electrolysis]], hydrogen can be generated from organic wastes (such as biomass or food-industry waste) using [[catalytic reforming]]. This releases hydrogen from carbonaceous substances at only 10–20% of energy used by electrolysis and may lead to hydrogen being produced from municipal wastes at below zero cost (allowing for the tipping fees and efficient catalytic reforming, such as cold-plasma). Catalytic (thermal) reforming is possible in small, distributed (even mobile) plants, to take advantage of low-value, stranded biomass/biowaste or natural gas deposits. Conversion of such wastes into ammonia solves the problem of hydrogen storage, as hydrogen can be released economically from ammonia on-demand, without the need for high-pressure or cryogenic storage.

It is also easier to store ammonia onboard vehicles than to store hydrogen, as ammonia is less flammable than petrol or LPG.

There is significant recent progress in synthesizing ammonia more efficiently from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than with the Haber process. In 2012, Masaaki Kitano (and 9 co-authors), working with an organic ruthenium catalyst, demonstrated "Ammonia Synthesis Using a Stable Electride as an Electron Donor and Reversible Hydrogen Store".&lt;ref&gt;{doi = 10.1038/nchem.1476}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Yutong Gong (and 12 co-authors) demonstrated "Ternary intermetallic LaCoSi as a catalyst for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation"&lt;ref&gt;{doi = 10.1038/s41929-017-0022-0}&lt;/ref&gt;, an equally efficient production process, not dependent on rare metal. In July 2018, Xiaoqian Wang (and 14 co-authors) demonstrated "Atomically dispersed Au 1 catalyst towards efficient electrochemical synthesis of ammonia"&lt;ref&gt;{doi = 10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.005}&lt;/ref&gt;, an even more efficient process.

For small scale laboratory synthesis, one can heat [[urea]] and Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:(NH2)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

==Liquid ammonia as a solvent==
{{See also|Inorganic nonaqueous solvent}}
Liquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied nonaqueous ionising solvent. Its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conductive solutions containing [[solvated electron]]s. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with those of water shows NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, [[viscosity]], [[dielectric constant]] and [[electrical conductivity]]; this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks, since each NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule. The ionic self-[[dissociation constant]] of liquid NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at −50&amp;nbsp;°C is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·l&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Liquid ammonia is an ionising solvent, although less so than water, and dissolves a range of ionic compounds, including many [[nitrate]]s, [[nitrite]]s, [[cyanide]]s, [[thiocyanate]]s, [[Cyclopentadienyl complex|metal cyclopentadienyl complexes]] and [[metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Neufeld, R.|author2=Michel, R. |author3=Herbst-Irmer, R. |author4=Schöne, R. |author5=Stalke, D. |journal=[[Chem.

The solubility of [[halide]] salts increases from [[fluoride]] to [[iodide]]. A saturated solution of [[ammonium nitrate]] ('''Divers' solution''', named after [[Edward Divers]]) contains 0.83&amp;nbsp;mol solute per mole of ammonia and has a [[vapour pressure]] of less than 1&amp;nbsp;bar even at {{convert|25|C|0|abbr=on}}.

===Solutions of metals===
{{See also|Solvated electron}}
Liquid ammonia will dissolve the [[alkali metal]]s and other [[Electronegativity|electropositive]] metals such as [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[strontium]], [[barium]], [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]]. At low concentrations (&lt;0.06&amp;nbsp;mol/l), deep blue solutions are formed: these contain metal cations and [[solvated electron]]s, free electrons that are surrounded by a cage of ammonia molecules.

These solutions are very useful as strong reducing agents. At higher concentrations, the solutions are metallic in appearance and in electrical conductivity. At low temperatures, the two types of solution can coexist as [[Wiktionary:immiscible|immiscible]] phases.

The range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow, as the potential for oxidation to dinitrogen, [[Standard electrode potential|''E''°]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ 8NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is only +0.04&amp;nbsp;V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the [[Amide|metal amide]] and dihydrogen. Most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions; although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow, there is still a risk of explosion, particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts.

==Ammonia's role in biological systems and human disease==
[[File:Symptoms of hyperammonemia.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Main symptoms of hyperammonemia (ammonia reaching toxic concentrations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/944996-overview |title=eMedicine Specialties &gt; Metabolic Diseases &gt; Hyperammonemia|author= Roth, Karl S. |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ammonia is both a [[metabolic waste]] and a metabolic input throughout the [[biosphere]]. It is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds (more than 75%), few living creatures are capable of using this atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas. Therefore, [[nitrogen fixation]] is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing [[legume]]s, benefit from [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with [[rhizobia]] that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Adjei, M. B. |author2=Quesenberry, K. H. |author3=Chamblis, C.

===Biosynthesis===
In certain organisms, ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen by [[enzyme]]s called [[nitrogenase]]s. The overall process is called [[nitrogen fixation]]. Intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation; the scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;MoS&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Igarashi|first1=Robert Y.|last2=Laryukhin|first2=Mikhail|last3=Dos Santos|first3=Patricia C.|last4=Lee|first4=Hong-In|last5=Dean|first5=Dennis R.|last6=Seefeldt|first6=Lance C.|last7=Hoffman|first7=Brian M.|title=Trapping H- Bound to the Nitrogenase FeMo-Cofactor Active Site during H2 Evolution: Characterization by ENDOR Spectroscopy|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=May 2005|volume=127|issue=17|pages=6231–6241|doi=10.1021/ja043596p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia is also a metabolic product of [[amino acid]] [[deamination]] catalyzed by enzymes such as [[Glutamate dehydrogenase 1#Function|glutamate dehydrogenase 1]]. Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals. In humans, it is quickly converted to [[urea]], which is much less toxic, particularly less [[#Basicity|basic]]. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of [[urine]]. Most reptiles, birds, insects, and snails excrete [[uric acid]] solely as nitrogenous waste.

===In physiology===
Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal [[physiology]]. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The [[liver]] converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the [[urea cycle]]. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in [[cirrhosis]], may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as [[ornithine transcarbamylase]], lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and [[coma]] of [[hepatic encephalopathy]], as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and [[organic aciduria]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zschocke, Johannes |author2=Hoffman, Georg |title=Vademecum Metabolism|publisher= Schattauer Verlag|year= 2004|isbn=3794523857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from [[glutamine]], [[α-ketoglutarate]] may be degraded to produce two molecules of [[bicarbonate]], which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rose, Burton |author2=Helmut Rennke|title=Renal Pathophysiology|location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins|year= 1994|isbn=0-683-07354-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonium ions are a [[Toxicity|toxic]] waste product of [[metabolism]] in [[animal]]s. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the [[urea cycle]] to [[urea]], because it is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into [[uric acid]], which is solid, and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil Campbell (scientist) |author2=[[Jane Reece|Jane B.

===Interstellar space===
Ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in 1968, based on [[microwave]] emissions from the direction of the [[Milky Way|galactic core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cheung, A.

The sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of [[molecular cloud]]s.&lt;ref name=ho&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ho, P.

The following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected:
:NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[Deuterium|D]], NHD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ND&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
The detection of triply [[deuterium|deuterated]] ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce. It is thought that the low-temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Millar, T. J.|title=Deuterium Fractionation in Interstellar Clouds|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume= 106|issue=1|pages=73–86|doi=10.1023/A:1024677318645|year=2003|bibcode = 2003SSRv..106...73M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its interstellar discovery, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium. With a large number of transitions sensitive to a wide range of excitation conditions, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has been widely astronomically detected – its detection has been reported in hundreds of journal articles. Listed below is a sample of journal articles that highlights the range of detectors that have been used to identify ammonia.

The study of interstellar ammonia has been important to a number of areas of research in the last few decades. Some of these are delineated below and primarily involve using ammonia as an interstellar thermometer.

====Interstellar formation mechanisms====
[[File:Diamminesilver(I)-3D-balls.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Ball-and-stick model of the diamminesilver(I) cation, [Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]
The interstellar abundance for ammonia has been measured for a variety of environments. The [NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] ratio has been estimated to range from 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; in small dark clouds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ungerechts, H. |author2=Walmsley, C.

: NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H·

The rate constant, ''k'', of this reaction depends on the temperature of the environment, with a value of 5.2×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; at 10 K.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vikor, L.|year=1999|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=344|page=1027|url=http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-journal_query?volume=344&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;page=1027&amp;plate=&amp;cover=&amp;journal=A%2BA..|title=Branching fractions of dissociative recombination of NH4+ and NH2+ molecular ions|bibcode = 1999A&amp;A...344.1027V|last2=Al-Khalili|first2=A.|last3=Danared|first3=H.|last4=Djuric|first4=N.|last5=Dunn|first5=G.

Assuming an NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; abundance of 3×10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; and an electron abundance of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; typical of molecular clouds, the formation will proceed at a rate of {{val|1.6e−9|u= cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} in a molecular cloud of total density {{val|e=5|u=cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=van Dishoeck, E. F. |author2=Black, J. H.|year=1986|journal=Astrophys. J. Suppl.

All other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between 2 and 13 orders of magnitude smaller, making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrochemistry.net |title=astrochemistry.net |publisher=astrochemistry.net |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play, the reaction:

: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H

has a rate constant of 2.2×10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;. Assuming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; densities of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and [NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;, this reaction proceeds at a rate of 2.2×10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;, more than 3 orders of magnitude slower than the primary reaction above.

Some of the other possible formation reactions are:
: H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: PNH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → P + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

====Interstellar destruction mechanisms====
There are 113 total proposed reactions leading to the destruction of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Of these, 39 were tabulated in extensive tables of the chemistry among C, N, and O compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1980ApJS...43....1P|author1=Prasad, S. S.  |author2=Huntress, W.

with rate constants of 4.39×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Lininger, W. |author2=Albritton, D. L. |author3=Fehsenfeld, F. C. |author4=Schmeltekopf, A.

The above equations ({{EquationNote|1}}, {{EquationNote|2}}) run at a rate of 8.8×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; and 4.4×10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. These calculations assumed the given rate constants and abundances of [NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] = 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;, [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] = 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;, [HCO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] = 2×10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;, and total densities of ''n'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, typical of cold, dense, molecular clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wooten, A. |author2=Bozyan, E.

This is due to the relatively high abundance of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Single antenna detections====
Radio observations of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the [[Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope]] reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components – a background ridge and an unresolved core. The background corresponds well with the locations previously detected CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson, T. L. |author2=Downes, D. |author3=Bieging, J. |year=1979|journal= Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume= 71|page= 275 |bibcode=1979A&amp;A....71..275W|title=Ammonia in Orion }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 25 m Chilbolton telescope in England detected radio signatures of ammonia in [[H II region]]s, HNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [[maser]]s, H-H objects, and other objects associated with star formation. A comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacDonald, G. H. |author2=Little, L. T. |author3=Brown, A. T. |author4=Riley, P. W. |author5=Matheson, D. N. |author6=Felli, M. |year=1981|journal= MNRAS|volume= 195|issue=2 |page= 387 |bibcode=1981MNRAS.195..387M|title=Detection of new ammonia sources |doi=10.1093/mnras/195.2.387 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including W3(OH), [[Orion (constellation)|Orion A]], W43, W51, and five sources in the galactic centre. The high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high-density regions are common in the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Morris, M., Zuckerman, B., Palmer, P., Turner, B. E. |year=1973|journal= Astrophysical Journal|volume= 186|page= 501 |bibcode=1973ApJ...186..501M|doi=10.1086/152515|title=Interstellar ammonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interferometric studies====
[[Very Large Array|VLA]] observations of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in seven regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than 0.1 [[Parsec|pc]] in L1551, S140, and [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus A]]. Three individual condensations were detected in Cepheus A, one of them with a highly elongated shape. They may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Torrelles, J. M., Ho, P. T. P., Rodriguez, L. F., Canto, J. |year=1985|journal= Astrophysical Journal|volume= 288|page= 595 |bibcode=1985ApJ...288..595T|doi=10.1086/162825|title=VLA observations of ammonia and continuum in regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the VLA in [[IC 342]]. The hot gas has temperatures above 70 K, which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ho, P. T. P., Martin, R. N., Turner, J. L., Jackson, J. M. |year=1990|journal= Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume= 355|page= L19 |bibcode=1990ApJ...355L..19H|doi=10.1086/185728|title=VLA imaging of extragalactic ammonia – Hot gas in the nucleus of IC 342}}&lt;/ref&gt; NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; was also monitored by VLA toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact HII regions: G9.62+0.19, G10.47+0.03, G29.96-0.02, and G31.41+0.31. Based upon temperature and density diagnostics, it is concluded that in general such clumps are probably the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact HII region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cesaroni, R., Churchwell, E., Hofner, P., Walmsley, C.

====Infrared detections====
Absorption at 2.97 micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the [[Becklin-Neugebauer Object]] and probably in NGC 2264-IR as well. This detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Knacke, R. F., McCorkle, S., Puetter, R. C., Erickson, E. F., Kraetschmer, W. |year=1982|journal= Astrophysical Journal|volume= 260|page= 141|bibcode=1982ApJ...260..141K|doi=10.1086/160241|title=Observation of interstellar ammonia ice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spectrum of the disk of Jupiter was obtained from the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]], covering the 100 to 300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; spectral range. Analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Orton, G. S., Aumann, H. H., Martonchik, J. V., Appleby, J. F. |year=1982|journal= Icarus|volume= 52|issue=1|page= 81 |bibcode=1982Icar...52...81O|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(82)90170-1|title=Airborne spectroscopy of Jupiter in the 100- to 300-cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; region: Global properties of ammonia gas and ice haze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 149 dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of 'dense cores' by using the (J,K) = (1,1) rotating inversion line of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, the cores are not spherically shaped, with aspect ratios ranging from 1.1 to 4.4. It is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benson, P. J. |author2=Myers, P. |year=1989|journal= Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series|volume= 71|page= 89 |bibcode=1989ApJS...71...89B|doi=10.1086/191365|title=A survey for dense cores in dark clouds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia has been detected in the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco Nebula]] and in one or possibly two molecular clouds, which are associated with the high-latitude galactic [[infrared cirrus]]. The finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the Population I metallicity B-type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Mebold, U., Heithausen, A., Reif, K.|year= 1987|journal= Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume= 180|page= 213|bibcode=1987A&amp;A...180..213M|title=Ammonia in the galactic halo and the infrared cirrus }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Observations of nearby dark clouds====
By balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission, it is possible to construct a relation between [[excitation temperature]] and density. Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to dark clouds, regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines—indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of ~10 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in dark clouds. Mapping of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 [[Parsec|pc]] and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation.

====UC HII regions====
Ultra-compact HII regions are among the best tracers of high-mass star formation. The dense material surrounding UCHII regions is likely primarily molecular. Since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed, ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material. Since this molecular material can be spatially resolved, it is possible to constrain the heating/ionising sources, temperatures, masses, and sizes of the regions. Doppler-shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars.

====Extragalactic detection====
Ammonia has been detected in external galaxies,&lt;ref&gt;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1979A%26A....74L...7M&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8197839&lt;/ref&gt; and by simultaneously measuring several lines, it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies. Line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm (~50 K), originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc. This picture is consistent with the picture within our [[Milky Way]] galaxy—hot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc (giant molecular clouds; GMCs).

The '''archaeology of shipwrecks''' is the field of [[Archaeology]] specialized most commonly in the study and exploration of [[shipwrecks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underwater Archaeology/Shipwrecks|url=http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/edu/themes/archaeology/welcome.html|website=Ocean Explorer|publisher=NOAA|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its techniques combine those of archaeology with those of [[Underwater diving|diving]] to become [[Underwater archaeology]]. However, shipwrecks are discovered on what have become terrestrial sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buried Ships|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgshp1.htm|website=SF Genealogy|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is necessary to understand the processes by which a wreck site is formed to take into account the distortions in the archaeological material caused by the filtering and scrambling of material remains that occurs during and after the wrecking process.

"When a ship is wrecked, it suffers many changes of state until the remains eventually reach [[Steady state|equilibrium]] with their environment.  Initially, the wrecking process changes it from the human organised form of a working vessel to an unstable state of structure and artefacts underwater. Natural forces act upon it during the wrecking process and continue to act until equilibrium is reached. Heavy items sink rapidly, lighter items may drift before sinking, while buoyant items may float away completely. This causes a filtering and scrambling of the material remains. The sudden arrival of a structure on the [[seabed]] will change the [[Ocean current|currents]], often resulting in new scour and deposition patterns in the seabed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navigating the impermanent|url=http://visualartists.ie/tag/rocky-shores/|website=Visual Artists Ireland|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once underwater, chemical processes and the action of biological organisms will contribute to the disintegration. At any point in these processes, humans may have intervened, for example by [[Marine salvage|salvaging]] items of value.

Prior to being wrecked, the ship would have operated as an organised machine, and its crew, equipment, passengers and cargo need to be considered as a system. The material remains should provide clues to the functions of [[Seakeeping|seaworthiness]], [[navigation]] and [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] as well as to ship-board life.

"Finally the ship as a means of transport can be considered as an element in a geographically dispersed social, political and economic system. [[Warships]] impose political will by force; [[cargo vessel]]s exist in a system of [[commerce]]; while passenger carrying vessels give clues to [[social classes]] and structure. [[Social status]] may also exist within the ship, for example, [[wikt:segregation|segregation]] between [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] and [[seamen]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Challenges, reasons and Interpretation of Underwater Archaeology|url=http://www.oceantreasures.org/pages/content/archaeological-pages/challenges-reasons-and-interpretation-of-underwater-archaeology.html|website=oceantreasures.org|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UNESCO Convention on the protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage==
Shipwrecks that have been underwater for one hundred years or more are protected by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]]. This convention aims at preventing looting and the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage - Text of the 2001 Convention|editor=UNESCO|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/2001-convention/official-text|access-date=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps states parties to protect their underwater cultural heritage with an international legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Underwater Cultural Heritage|editor=UNESCO|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage|access-date=2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example is the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/9705/newsbriefs/blackbeard.html |title=Blackbeard's Flagship - Archaeology Magazine Archive |publisher=Archive.archaeology.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is undergoing archaeological recovery by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources (NC DNCR) near Beaufort Inlet, NC. The infamous pirate [[Blackbeard]]'s flagship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackbeard's Queen Anne's Revenge Shipwreck Project|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/queen-annes-revenge|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; was discovered by Intersal, Inc., a private research firm, in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intersal, Inc.|url=http://www.lat3440.com/|website=Intersal, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological theories of shipwrecks==
===Muckelroy's model===
A systematic model for the characterisation and interpretation of the '''archaeology of shipwrecks''' was first proposed by [[Keith Muckelroy]] in 1976 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Muckleroy|first=K.|last2= |first2= |date= |title=The integration of historical and archaeological data concerning an historic wreck site: The 'Kennemerland'|url= |journal=World Archaeology|publisher= |volume=7|issue=3|year=1976|pages=280-289|doi= 10.1080/00438243.1976.9979641 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Muckelroy's system model describes the evolution of the material remains of the ship from the wrecking process, subsequent salvage operations and the disintegration and rearrangements of the remains  from environmental factors.  Although Muckelroy considered both natural processes and human activity in his model, subsequent research has mainly expanded the environmental factors and there has been little published on the human processes.  

===Considering human intervention===
A paper by Martin Gibbs in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibbs|first=M.|title=Cultural Site Formation Processes in Maritime Archaeology: Disaster Response, Salvage and Muckelroy 30 years|journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|volume=35.1|pages=4–19|doi=10.1111/j.1095-9270.2006.00088.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; expands Muckelroy's model to consider human behaviour at the time of the disaster and the long term relationship between people and [[shipwreck]]s. This model uses studies of humans involved in disasters to characterise the human activity into phases around the time of the wrecking. This model considers:
* ''Pre-impact threat phase'', in which humans considering the risk may take avoiding action which results in there being no wreck, or may take unsuccessful action to mitigate the perceived threat, for example the wreck location may be the result of attempting to avoid some perceived greater threat.  Stowage of cargo may also indicate consideration of threat.
* ''Pre-impact warning phase'', in which humans may take drastic action to avoid catastrophe, for example, running a vessel ashore, jettisoning cargo or running out anchors.
* ''Impact'', in which the decision is made to abandon ship or remain aboard, and, for example, attempt to refloat.
* ''Post impact'', where survivors regroup and, for example, salvage their own goods or make repairs.
* ''Rescue and Post-disaster'' where the vessel is abandoned and in which third parties may be involved in salvage or in removing remains that present a hazard to navigation.

==Preservation of material underwater==
Of the many examples where the sea bed provides an extremely hostile environment for submerged evidence of history, one of the most notable, the ''[[RMS Titanic]]'', though a relatively young wreck and in deep water so calcium-starved that [[concretion]]  does not occur, appears strong and relatively intact, though indications are  that it has already incurred irreversible degradation of her steel and iron hull. As such degradation inevitably continues, data will be forever lost, objects' context  will be destroyed and the bulk of the wreck will over centuries  completely deteriorate on the floor of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Comparative evidence shows that all  iron and steel ships, especially those in a highly oxygenated  environment,  continue to degrade and will continue to do so until only their  engines and other machinery project much  above the sea-floor.&lt;ref&gt;McCarthy, M., 2000, Iron and steamship archaeology : success and failure of the SS Xantho. New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum. {{ISBN|0-306-46365-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where it remains even after the passage of time,  the iron or steel hull is often fragile with no remaining metal within the layer of concretion and corrosion products. The ''[[USS Monitor]]'', having been found in the 1970s, was subjected to a program of attempted ''in situ'' preservation, for example, but deterioration of the vessel progressed at such a rate that the rescue of her turret was undertaken lest nothing be saved from the wreck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Broadwater|first1=John|title=The USS Monitor: In Situ Preservation and Recovery|url=https://www.academia.edu/3257947/The_USS_Monitor_In_Situ_Preservation_and_Recovery|website=academia.edu|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some wrecks, lost to natural obstacles to navigation, are at risk of being smashed by subsequent wrecks sunk by the same hazard, or are deliberately destroyed because they present a hazard to navigation. Even in deep water, commercial activities such as pipe-laying operations and deep sea trawling can place a wreck at risk.  Such a wreck is the ''Mardi Gras'' [[shipwreck]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=Nautilus Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; sunk in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water. The shipwreck lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck |url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |website=uwf.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |archivedate=2015-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large pipelines can crush sites and render some of their remnants inaccessible as pipe is dropped from the ocean surface to the substrate thousands of feet below. Trawl nets snag and tear superstructures and separate artifacts from their context.

[[File:The Vasa from the Bow.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The bow of ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]'', a Swedish warship that foundered and sank on its maiden voyage in 1628. It was salvaged in 1961 and is now on permanent display at the [[Vasa Museum]] in Stockholm.]]
The wrecks, and other archaeological sites that have been preserved have generally survived because the dynamic nature of the sea bed can result in artifacts becoming rapidly buried in sediments. These sediments then provide an anaerobic environment which protects from further degradation. Wet environments, whether on land in the form of peat bogs and wells, or underwater are particularly important for the survival of organic material, such as wood, leather, fabric and horn. Cold and absence of light also aid survival of artifacts, because there is little energy available for either organic activity or chemical reactions. Salt water provides for greater organic activity than freshwater, and in particular, the [[shipworm]], terredo navalis, lives only in salt water, so some of the best preservation in the absence of sediments has been found in the cold, dark waters of the [[Great Lakes]] in North America and in the (low salinity) [[Baltic Sea]] (where the ''Vasa'' was preserved).

=== Interpretation and presentation of shipwrecks ===
Diver trails also called wreck trails can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-diving&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Souter, C., 2006 Cultural Tourism and Diver Education. In Maritime Archaeology: Australian Approaches. The Springer Series in Underwater Archaeology. Staniforth, M. &amp; Nash, M. (eds) Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; One excellent example is the [[Florida Public Archaeology Network]]'s (FPAN) "Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail|url=http://www.floridapanhandledivetrail.com/|website=Florida Panhandle Dive Trail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail features 12 [[shipwrecks]] including [[artificial reefs]] and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blair|first1=Kimberly|title=Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail beckons divers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2014/08/07/florida-panhandle-shipwreck-trail/13751693/|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise presentation will typically rely on publication (book or [[academic journal|journal]] articles, web-sites and electronic media such as CD-ROM). Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The ''Mardi Gras'' Shipwreck Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mardi Gras Shipwreck |url=http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |website=uwf.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516045935/http://uwf.edu/jkent/fpan_preCMS/mardigras/ |archivedate=2015-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated a one-hour HD documentary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landis|first1=Nomee|title=Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck Documentary|url=http://nautilusproductions.com/projects/mystery-mardi-gras-shipwreck-documentary|website=nautilusproductions.com|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live [[Underwater videography|underwater video]] of the ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'' Shipwreck Project was [[webcast]] to the [[Internet]] as a part of the ''QAR DiveLive''&lt;ref&gt;http://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll22/id/695248&lt;/ref&gt; educational program that reached thousands of children around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=C Southerly and J Gillman-Bryan. |title=Diving on the Queen Anne's Revenge |journal=In: SF Norton (ed).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8316">The '''Berlin Institute for Population and Development''' ({{lang-de|Berlin-Institut für Bevölkerung und Entwicklung}}) is an independent scientific research institute that aims to improve the way in which international [[Demography|demographic]] change is perceived and dealt with in the context of [[sustainable development]]. To reach this goal, the institute publishes studies and discussion papers. It also offers an online handbook on demography and publishes a [[newsletter]]. The institute is financed by contributions, project funds, earnings from the [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|foundation’s]] endowment, and contributions to the endowment. The institute is headed by Reiner Klingholz, who studied chemistry, earning a PhD in molecular biology. Earlier in his career, Reiner Klingholz worked as a journalist for the German weekly Die Zeit and the bi-annual magazine Geo Wissen.

== History ==

The Berlin Institute for Population and Development was founded in 2000 by Marlene von Reichenbach and has since been recognised as a foundation (non-profit organisation). The institute has no political or [[Religion|religious]] affiliations.

During the initial years of its existence, the institute received general support from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Today it has a broad range of sponsors, which are listed on the institute’s website. Among the more prominent are the Robert Bosch Foundation, the Erste Foundation, and the Software AG Foundation.&lt;ref name=berlininst/&gt;

''The Demographic State of the Nation – How Sustainable Are Germany’s Regions?'' (2006) describes demographic change in [[Germany]] and its expected impact on Germany’s 439 German [[region]]s and [[Municipality|municipalities]]. Based on a set of 22 demographic, [[Economics|economic]], social, and [[education]]al indicators, the authors of the study come up with an assessment of the sustainability of each of the 439 units covered. Aside from identifying general trends such as an [[ageing]] and dwindling population, the study sheds light on some important patterns of internal [[human migration|migration]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany headed for population disaster? |url=http://www.dawn.com/2006/04/28/fea.htm |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The urban regions surrounding big cities like [[Berlin]], [[Munich]] and [[Hamburg]], alongside other economically prosperous regions, turn out to be prime destinations for internal migrants.   

''Male Emergency'' (2007) analyses the causes and consequences of young women leaving the states of eastern Germany: the regions are becoming poorer – socially, economically and demographically. A portion of the men who have stayed behind now constitute a new [[underclass]]. The authors of the study Male Emergency see educational advancement as the main reason for the disproportionate outward migration of young women. They strongly recommend setting up programmes aimed at boosting the motivation and educational qualifications of young males who have fallen behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=East German women flee for western jobs |url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=153695 |work=[[Tehran Times]] |date=25 September 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Unintentionally Childless'' (2007) looks into the question of how [[reproductive medicine]] can contribute to mitigating the demographic crisis in Germany. The study concludes that aside from modern family policies and increased efforts to combat the causes of biological-medical infertility, [[medicine]] could help couples, whose wish for children has gone unfulfilled, thus contributing, to a certain extent, to raising birth rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unfreiwillig ohne Kinder |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/gesundheit/659/378465/text/ |work=[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Talents, Technology and Tolerance'' (2007) examines, on the basis of [[Richard Florida]]’s theory of the [[creative class]], the prospects of Germany’s regions in a future knowledge-based society. The theory postulates that a successful economy requires a society in which talent, technology and tolerance can all flourish equally. Measured according to the TTT criteria, Berlin possesses the greatest creative potential among the German states, followed by Hamburg and [[Baden-Württemberg]]. By comparison, the eastern German states of [[Brandenburg]], [[Thuringia]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]] lag far behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Creative Class' Could Fuel Berlin Boom |url=http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/oct2007/gb20071010_858418.htm?chan=search |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=10 October 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205165758/http://businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/oct2007/gb20071010_858418.htm?chan=search |archivedate=5 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Emancipation or child benefits?'' (2008) compares the social conditions for different fertility rates in the nations of western Europe based on an array of socioeconomic indicators. It shows clearly that the traditionally negative correlation between wealth and social development on the one hand and fertility on the other no longer holds once a society has reached a certain level of [[social development|development]]. Today more children are born in the countries with the most advanced social systems in regard to [[gender equality]]. Based on this result, we propose to discuss the problem of low-fertility countries from a different point of view. Neither child benefits nor other sources of financial aid appear to motivate people in modern industrial societies to have more children. What is far more crucial is equality of men and women in society.

''Europe’s Demographic Future'' (2008) is the institute’s first major study that has been translated fully into English. The study compares and assesses the various regions of the EU-27 countries as well as [[Norway]], [[Switzerland]], [[Iceland]], as well as a number of selected eastern European countries on the basis of 24 demographic, economic, social, and [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]al indicators. The study shows the very different ways in which individual countries are affected by and deal with demographic challenges. The authors of the study map out the ways in which mutual learning can help European countries in dealing with concrete challenges facing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Study Shows Europe's Population Falling |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93995083 |work=[[NPR]] |date=26 August 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unutilised Potentials – On the Current State of Integration in Germany'' (2009) is dedicated to the 15 million persons in Germany that have a migration background. In order to assess the integration performance of eight different immigrant groups, the institute has developed an Integration Measurement Index (IMI), which is based on 20 indicators for assimilation, [[education]], working life, and [[social security]]. The results of the study show that the roughly two million persons stemming from other EU-25 countries (without southern [[Europe]]) are best integrated. On the other hand, migrants from [[Turkey]] in particular tend to show massive integration deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Survey Shows Alarming Lack of Integration in Germany |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,603588,00.html |work=[[Spiegel Online]] |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Looked at in regional terms, integration tends generally to work out better in places where there is demand in the [[labour market]] for large numbers of highly qualified workers.&lt;ref name=berlininst&gt;[http://www.berlin-institut.org Website of the Berlin Institute for Population and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wisdom of Solomon''' or '''Book of Wisdom''' is a Jewish work, written in Greek, composed in [[Alexandria]] (Egypt). Generally dated to the 2nd century BC, the central theme of the work is "Wisdom" itself, appearing under two principal aspects. In its relation to man, Wisdom is the perfection of knowledge of the righteous as a gift from God showing itself in action. In direct relation to God, Wisdom is with God from all eternity.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}} It is one of the seven [[Sapiential Books|Sapiential]] or wisdom books included within the [[Septuagint]], along with [[Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]], [[Ecclesiastes]], [[Song of Songs]] (Song of Solomon), [[Book of Job|Job]], and [[Wisdom of Sirach|Sirach]], and is included in the canon of [[Deuterocanonical books]] by the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and the ''anagignoskomena'' (Gr. ἀναγιγνωσκόμενα, meaning "those which are to be read") of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].

==Structure, genre and content==
The structure can be divided into three sections:{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=22-23}}
# Book of [[Eschatology]]
#* exhortation to justice
#* speech of the impious, contrasts of the wicked and the just
#* exhortation to wisdom
# Book of Wisdom
#* Solomon's speech concerning wisdom, wealth, power and prayer
# Book of History
#* introduction, followed by diptychs of plagues
#* digression on God's power and mercy
#* digression on false worship and further plagues
#* recapitulation and concluding [[doxology]].

The book is addressed to the rulers of the earth, urging them to love righteousness and seek wisdom; the wicked think that all is chance and that they should enjoy each day, but they are deluded.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=13}} In the second section Solomon (not explicitly named, but strongly implied) tells of his search for wisdom.

The Wisdom of Solomon can be linked to several forms of ancient literature, both Jewish and non-Jewish, but it clearly belongs with biblical Wisdom books such as [[the Book of Job]], one of only five such books among ancient Jewish literature.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=25}} In terms of classical genre it has been identified as an [[encomium]] and with the Greek genre of the "exhortatory discourse", by which a teacher attempts to persuade others to a certain course of action.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=25-26}}

==Composition==
The Wisdom of Solomon was written in Greek, in [[Alexandria]] (Egypt), in the late 1st century BC to early 1st century AD; the author's prime literary source was the [[Septuagint]], in particular the [[Wisdom literature]] and the [[Book of Isaiah]], and he was familiar with late Jewish works as the [[Book of Enoch]] and with Greek philosophical literature.{{sfn|Hayman|2003|p=763}} It is uncertain whether the book has a single author or comes from a school of writers, but recent scholarship has favoured regarding it as a unified work.{{sfn|Grabbe|2004|p=24}} In either case its blend of Greek and Jewish features suggests a learned Hellenistic background, and despite the address to the "rulers of the world" the actual audience was probably members of the author's own community who were tempted to give up their Jewishness in the face of the temptations of Greek culture and the hostile conditions facing Jews in the Greek world.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}}

==Themes==
The book opens with the opposed pairs righteousness/unrighteousness and death/immortality: those who do not follow righteousness will fall into "senseless reasoning" and will not be open to wisdom; wisdom is not an inherent human quality nor one that can be taught, but comes from outside, and only to those who are prepared through righteousness.{{sfn|Hayman|2003|p=764}} The suffering of the righteous will be rewarded with immortality, while the wicked will end miserably.{{sfn|Horbury|2007|pp=655-656}} The unrighteous are doomed because they do not know God's purpose, but the righteous will judge the unrighteous in God's presence.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=293}} Lady Wisdom dominates the next section, in which Solomon speaks.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=293}} She existed from the [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]], and God is her source and guide.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=293}} She is to be loved and desired, and kings seek her: Solomon himself preferred Wisdom to wealth, health, and all other things.{{sfn|Horbury|2007|p=658}} She in turn has always come to the aid of the righteous, from Adam to the Exodus.{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}} The final section takes up the theme of the rescue of the righteous, taking the Exodus as its focus: "You (God) have not neglected to help (your people the Jews) at all times and in all places." (Wisdom of Solomon, 19:22).{{sfn|Tanzer|1998|p=294}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="639">'''Certosina''' is a decorative art technique used widely in the [[Italian Renaissance]] period. Similar to [[marquetry]], it uses small pieces of wood, bone, metal, or mother-of-pearl to create inlaid geometric patterns on wood. The term comes from [[Certosa di Pavia|Certosa Church in Pavia]], where the technique was used in ornamenting an altarpiece.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
&lt;!-- NOTE: This article uses British English. Standard U.S. English drops the hyphen, resulting in "cooperation" or "cooperative." --&gt;
In [[evolution]], '''co-operation''' is the process where groups of organisms work or act together for common or mutual benefits. It is commonly defined as any [[adaptation]] that has evolved, at least in part, to increase the [[reproductive success]] of the actor's social partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner|first1=Andy|last2=Griffin|first2=Ashleigh|last3=West|first3=Stuart|title=Theory of Cooperation|journal=eLS|date=December 2009 |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0021910}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, territorial choruses by male [[lion]]s discourage intruders and are likely to benefit all contributors.&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock 2009 51–57"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clutton-Brock|first=T|title=Cooperation between non-kin in animal societies|journal=Nature|date=5 November 2009|volume=462|issue=7269|pages=51–57|doi=10.1038/nature08366|bibcode=2009Natur.462...51C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process contrasts with intragroup competition where individuals work against each other for selfish reasons. Cooperation exists not only in humans but in other animals as well. The diversity of taxa that exhibits cooperation is quite large, ranging from [[zebra]] herds to pied [[Old World babbler|babblers]] to [[African elephants]]. Many animal and plant species cooperate with both members of their own species and with members of other species.

==In animals==

Cooperation in animals appears to occur mostly for direct benefit or between relatives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319508733|title=For whose benefit? The biological and cultural evolution of human cooperation|last=Lindenfors|first=Patrik|publisher=Springer|year=2017|isbn=9783319508740|location=Cham, Switzerland|pages=|oclc=979992026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spending time and resources assisting a related individual may at first seem destructive to an organism's chances of survival but is actually beneficial over the long-term. Since relatives share part of the helper's genetic make-up, enhancing each individual's chance of survival may actually increase the likelihood that the helper's genetic traits will be passed on to future generations.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W. D. | year = 1964 | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 1–16 | doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 | pmid=5875341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some researchers, such as ecology professor Tim Clutton-Brock, assert that cooperation is a more complex process. They state that helpers may receive more direct, and less indirect, gains from assisting others than is commonly reported. These gains include protection from predation and increased reproductive fitness. Furthermore, they insist that cooperation may not solely be an interaction between two individuals but may be part of the broader goal of unifying populations.&lt;ref name="Clutton"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Clutton-Brock | first1 = T. | year = 2002 | title = Breeding together: Kin selection and mutualism in cooperative vertebrates | url = | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5565| pages = 69–72 | doi = 10.1126/science.296.5565.69 | pmid=11935014| bibcode = 2002Sci...296...69C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent biologists, such as [[Charles Darwin]], [[E. O. Wilson]], and [[W. D. Hamilton]], have found the [[evolution of cooperation]] fascinating because [[natural selection]] favors those who achieve the greatest reproductive success while [[cooperative]] behavior often decreases the reproductive success of the actor (the individual performing the cooperative behavior). Hence, cooperation seemed to pose a challenging problem to the theory of natural selection, which rests on the assumption that individuals compete to survive and maximize their reproductive successes.&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock 2009 51–57"/&gt; Additionally, some species have been found to perform cooperative behaviors that may at first sight seem detrimental to their own evolutionary fitness. For example, when a [[ground squirrel]] sounds an alarm call to warn other group members of a nearby coyote, it draws attention to itself and increases its own odds of being eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=P|title=Nepotism and the evolution of alarm calls|journal=Science|date=23 September 1977|volume=197|issue=4310|pages=1246–1253|doi=10.1126/science.197.4310.1246|pmid=17781971|bibcode=1977Sci...197.1246S}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been multiple hypotheses for the evolution of cooperation, all of which are rooted in Hamilton's models based on [[inclusive fitness]]. These models hypothesize that cooperation is favored by natural selection due to either direct fitness benefits (mutually beneficial cooperation) or indirect fitness benefits ([[Altruism (biology)#Implications in evolutionary theory|altruistic cooperation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=W|title=The genetical evolution of social behaviour. II |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |date=1 July 1964|volume=7|issue=1|pages=17–52|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6|pmid=5875340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As explained below, direct benefits encompass by-product benefits and enforced reciprocity, while indirect benefits (kin selection) encompass limited dispersal, kin discrimination and the greenbeard effect.

=== Kin selection===
One specific form of cooperation in animals is kin selection, which involves animals promoting the reproductive success of their kin, thereby promoting their own fitness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clutton" /&gt;{{refn|1=An individual's gene complement (or genome) can be represented by the letters of the alphabet. Each letter is represented twice: A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This individual's genome therefore consists of 52 genes. The subscript indicates from which parent that copy of A has come. Mostly the two copies are identical, but occasionally they differ slightly.

When this individual reproduces sexually, one or other copy of A (chosen randomly) is passed on to offspring-1, who gets its other copy of A from the sexual partner. The same happens with genes B, C, D, ..., Z. If we denote the two sexual partners by means of subscripts "m" and "f", then the genome of the offspring they produce might consist of A&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;/A&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;/B&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/C&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;f1&lt;/sub&gt; ... Z&lt;sub&gt;m1&lt;/sub&gt;/Z&lt;sub&gt;f2&lt;/sub&gt;. Each parent has contributed exactly half of the offspring's genome. So individual "m" shares only half of its genome with its offspring.
Suppose individuals "m" and "f" produce a second offspring (offspring-2), whose genome is determined in exactly the same manner. There is a coin-flip 50% probability that offspring-2 will inherit the same copy of A from "m" as offspring-1 did (i.e. A&lt;sub&gt;m2&lt;/sub&gt;). This also applies to gene B and so on through the alphabet. If a coin-flip "heads" means that gene X is the same in offspring-1 as it is in offspring-2, then in 26 flips of the coin approximately half are going to be "heads" and the rest "tails", i.e. half the genes inherited from parent "m" will be the same in the two offspring. The same will happen to the genes inherited from parent "f". Thus of the 52 genes inherited from the two parents, on average, 13&amp;nbsp;+ &amp;nbsp;13&amp;nbsp;= &amp;nbsp;26 (or half) will be identical in the two sibs.
Thus sibs are genetically as similar to one another as a parent is to an offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Grafen, A. (1984) Natural selection, kin selection and group selection. In Krebs, J. R. &amp; Davies, N. B. (Eds.) ''Behavioural Ecology. An Evolutionary Approach.'' (p. 70-71). Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications. {{ISBN|0632009985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maynardsmith&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1 =J.|title=Evolutionary Genetics |date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198542151|pages=173–175|url= |chapter=Evolution in structured populations }}&lt;/ref&gt; From a evolutionary genetic point of view it is therefore as advantageous to help with the upbringing of full sibs as it is to produce and raise one's own offspring.|group=nb}}

Different theories explaining kin selection have been proposed, including the "pay-to-stay" and "territory inheritance" hypotheses. The "pay-to-stay" theory suggests that individuals help others rear offspring in order to return the favor of the breeders allowing them to live on their land. The "territory inheritance" theory contends that individuals help in order to have improved access to breeding areas once the breeders depart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Balshine-Earn | first1 = S. | last2 = Neat | first2 = F.C. | last3 = Reid | first3 = H. | last4 = Taborsky | first4 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Paying to stay or paying to breed?

Studies conducted on red wolves support previous researchers' contention that helpers obtain both immediate and long-term gains from cooperative breeding.&lt;ref name="Clutton" /&gt; Researchers evaluated the consequences of red wolves' decisions to stay with their packs for extended periods of time after birth. While delayed dispersal helped other wolves' offspring, studies also found that it extended male helper wolves' life spans. This suggests that kin selection may not only benefit an individual in the long-term through increased fitness but also in the short-term through increased survival chances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sparkman | first1 = A.

Some research suggests that individuals provide more help to closer relatives. This phenomenon is known as kin discrimination.&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffin | first1 = A. S. | last2 = West | first2 = S. A. | year = 2003 | title = Kin Discrimination and the Benefit of Helping in Cooperatively Breeding Vertebrates | url = | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5645| pages = 634–636 | doi = 10.1126/science.1089402 | pmid=14576431| bibcode = 2003Sci...302..634G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In their meta-analysis, researchers compiled data on kin selection as mediated by genetic relatedness in 18 species, including the [[western bluebird]], [[pied kingfisher]], [[Australian magpie]], and [[dwarf mongoose]]. They found that different species exhibited varying degrees of kin discrimination, with the largest frequencies occurring among those who have the most to gain from cooperative interactions.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

== In plants ==

Cooperation exists not only in animals but also in plants. In a greenhouse experiment with ''Ipomoea hederacea'', a climbing plant, results show that kin groups have higher efficiency rates in growth than non-kin groups do. This is expected to rise out of reduced competition within the kin groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biernaskie|first=J. M.|title=Evidence for competition and cooperation among climbing plants|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2011|volume=278|issue=1714|pages=1989–96|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.1771|pmid=21147795|pmc=3107641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
The inclusive fitness theory provides a good overview of possible solutions to the fundamental problem of cooperation. The theory is based on the hypothesis that cooperation helps in transmitting underlying genes to future generations either through increasing the reproductive successes of the individual (direct fitness) or of other individuals who carry the same genes (indirect fitness).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Direct benefits can result from simple by-product of cooperation or enforcement mechanisms, while indirect benefits can result from cooperation with genetically similar individuals.&lt;ref name="Hamilton"/&gt;

=== Direct fitness benefits ===

This is also called mutually beneficial cooperation as both actor and recipient depend on direct fitness benefits, which are broken down into two different types: [[Byproduct|by-product benefit]] and [[enforcement]].

By-product benefit arises as a consequence of social partners having a shared interest in cooperation. For example, in meerkats, larger group size provides a benefit to all the members of that group by increasing survival rates, foraging success and conflict wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clutton-Brock|first=T |author2=Brotherton, P. N. |author3=Russell, A. F. |author4=O'Riain, M. J. |author5=Gaynor, D. |author6=Kansky, R. |author7=Griffin, A. |author8=Manser, M. |author9=Sharpe, L. |author10=McIlrath, G.

By-product benefit can also arise as a consequence of subordinate animals staying and helping a nest that is dominated by leaders who often suffer high mortality rates. It has been shown that cooperation would be most advantageous for the sex that is more likely to remain and breed in the natal group. This is because the subordinate will have a higher chance to become dominant in the group as time passes. Cooperation in this scenario is often seen between non-related members of the same species, such as the wasp ''[[Polistes dominula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strassmann|first=J |author2=Seppa, P. |author3=Queller, D. C. |title=Absence of within-colony kin discrimination: foundresses of the social wasp, ''Polistes carolina'', do not prefer their own larvae|journal=Naturwissenschaften|date=10 August 2000|volume=87|issue=6|pages=266–269|doi=10.1007/s001140050718|pmid=10929290|bibcode=2000NW.....87..266S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prisoner's Delight''', another term to describe '''by-product benefit''', is a term coined by [[Kenneth Binmore]] in 2007 after he found that benefits can result as an automatic consequence of an otherwise "self-interested" act in [[cooperative hunting]]. He illustrated this with a scenario having two hunters, each hunter having the choice of hunting (cooperate) or not hunting (free-riding). Assuming that cooperative hunting results in greater rewards than just a one-player hunt, when hunting is not rare, both hunters and non-hunters benefit because either player is likely to be with other hunters, and thus likely to reap the rewards of a successful hunt. This situation demonstrates "Prisoner's Delight" because the food of a successful hunt is shared between the two players regardless of whether or not they participated.&lt;ref name="Behavioral Ecology 2012"&gt;''An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology''. Davies, Nicholas B., John R. Krebs, and Stuart A. West. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that [[free riding]], or reaping the benefits without any effort, is often a problem in collective action. Examples of free riding would be if an employee in a labor union pays no dues, but still benefits from union representation. In a study published in 1995, scientists found that [[Panthera leo|female lions]] showed individual differences in the extent to which they participated in group-territorial conflict. Some lions consistently 'cooperated' by approaching intruders, while others 'lagged' behind to avoid the risk of fighting. Although the lead female recognized the laggards, she failed to punish them, suggesting that cooperation is not maintained by reciprocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinsohn|first=R|author2=Packer, C.|title=Complex cooperative strategies in group-territorial African lions|journal=Science|date=1 September 1995|volume=269|issue=5228|pages=1260–1262|doi=10.1126/science.7652573|pmid=7652573|bibcode=1995Sci...269.1260H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperation is maintained in situations where [[Free rider problem|free-riding]] is a problem through enforcement, which is the mechanism where the actor is rewarded for cooperating or punished for not cooperating. This happens when cooperation is favored in aiding those who have helped the actors in the past. Punishment for noncooperation has been documented in [[meerkats]], where dominant females will attack and evict subordinate females who become pregnant. The pregnancy is seen as a failure to cooperate because only the dominant females are allowed to bear offspring. Dominant females will attack and kill the offspring of subordinate females if they evade [[eviction]] and eviction often leads to increased stress and decreased survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Norris|first=Scott|title=Murderous Meerkat Moms Contradict Caring Image, Study Finds|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/03/0315_060315_meerkats.html|publisher=National Geographic News|accessdate=20 November 2013|date=15 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement can also be mutually beneficial, and is often called [[Reciprocal altruism|reciprocal cooperation]] because the act of cooperation is preferentially directed at individuals who have helped the actor in the past (directly), or helped those who have helped the actor in the past (indirectly).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Andy|author2=Ashleigh S Griffin |author3=Stuart A West |title=Theory of Cooperation|journal=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences|year=2009|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indirect fitness benefits ===
The second class of explanations for cooperation is indirect fitness benefits, or [[Altruism (biology)|altruistic]] cooperation. There are three major mechanisms that generate this type of fitness benefit: [[Biological dispersal|limited dispersal]], [[kin discrimination]] and the [[green-beard effect]].

Hamilton originally suggested that high relatedness could arise in two ways: direct kin recognition between individuals or limited dispersal, or population viscosity, which can keep relatives together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kummerli|first=Rolf|author2=Andy Gardner |author3=Stuart A. West |author4=Ashleigh S. Griffin |title=Limited Dispersal, Budding Dispersal, and Cooperation: An Experimental Study|journal=Evolution|date=April 2009|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00548.x |volume=63 |pages=939–949 |pmid=19154373}}&lt;/ref&gt; The easiest way to generate relatedness between social partners is limited dispersal, a mechanism in which genetic similarity correlates with spatial proximity. If individuals do not move far, then kin usually surrounds them. Hence, any act of altruism would be directed primarily towards kin. This mechanism has been shown in ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' bacteria, where cooperation is disfavored when populations are well mixed, but favored when there is high local relatedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=A |author2=West, S. A. |author3=Buckling, A. |title=Cooperation and competition in pathogenic bacteria|journal=Nature|date=28 August 2004|volume=430|issue=7003|pages=1024–1027|doi=10.1038/nature02744 |pmid=15329720|bibcode=2004Natur.430.1024G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kin discrimination also influences cooperation because the actor can give aid preferentially towards related partners. Since kin usually share common genes, it is thought that this nepotism can lead to genetic relatedness between the actor and the partner's offspring, which affects the cooperation an actor might give.

This mechanism is similar to what happens with the [[green-beard effect]], but with the green-beard effect, the actor has to instead identify which of its social partners share the gene for cooperation. A green-beard system must always co-occur within individuals and alleles to produce a perceptible trait, recognition of this trait in others, and preferential treatment to those recognized. Examples of green-beard behavior have been found in [[hydrozoans]], [[slime molds]], [[yeast]], and [[ants]]. An example is in [[Uta stansburiana|side-blotch lizards]], where blue-throated males preferentially establish territories next to each other. Results show that neighboring blue-throats are more successful at mate guarding. However, blue males next to larger, more aggressive orange males suffer a cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sinervo|first=Barry |author2=Alexis Chaine |author3=Jean Clobert |author4=Ryan Calsbeek |author5=Lisa Hazard |author6=Lesley Lancaster |author7=Andrew G. McAdam |author8=Suzanne Alonzo |author9=Gwynne Corrigan |author10=Michael E. Hochberg |title=Self-recognition, color signals, and cycles of greenbeard mutualism and altruism|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=1 May 2006|volume=103|issue=19|pages=7372–7377|doi=10.1073/pnas.0510260103|pmid=16651531|pmc=1564281|bibcode=2006PNAS..103.7372S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multi-level selection ==
{{main|Multi-level selection}}
Multi-level selection theory suggests that selection operates on more than one level: for example, it may operate at an atomic and molecular level in cells, at the level of cells in the body, and then again at the whole organism level, and the community level, and the species level. Any level which is not competitive with others of the same level will be eliminated, even if the level below is highly competitive. A classic example is that of genes which prevent [[cancer]]. Cancer cells divide uncontrollably, and at the cellular level, they are very successful, because they are (in the short term) reproducing very well and out competing other cells in the body. However, at the whole organism level, cancer is often fatal, and so may prevent reproduction. Therefore, changes to the genome which prevent cancer (for example, by causing damaged cells to act co-operatively by destroying themselves) are favoured. Multi-level selection theory contends that similar effects can occur, for example, to cause individuals to co-operate to avoid behaviours which favour themselves short-term, but destroy the community (and their descendants) long term.

== Market effect ==
One theory suggesting a mechanism that could lead to the evolution of co-operation is the "market effect" as suggested by Noe and Hammerstein.&lt;ref name= "Noe &amp; Hammerstein, 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00167053 | last1 = Noe | first1 = R. | last2 = Hammerstein | first2 = P. | year = 1994 | title = Biological markets: supply and demand determine the effect of partner choice in cooperation, mutualism and mating | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 1–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism relies on the fact that in many situations there exists a [[trade-off]] between efficiency obtaining a desired resource and the amount of resources one can actively obtain. In that case, each partner in a system could benefit from specializing in producing one specific resource and obtaining the other resource by [[trade]]. When only two partners exist, each can specialize in one [[Resource (economics)|resource]], and trade for the other. Trading for the resource requires co-operation with the other partner and includes a process of bidding and bargaining.

This mechanism can be relied to both within a species or social group and within species systems. It can also be applied to a multi-partner system, in which the owner of a resource has the power to choose its co-operation partner. This model can be applied in natural systems (examples exist in the world of apes, cleaner fish, and more). Easy for exemplifying, though, are systems from international trading. Arabic countries control vast amounts of oil, but seek technologies from western countries. These in turn are in need of Arab oil. The solution is co-operation by trade.

== Symbiosis ==
[[Symbiosis]] refers to two or more biological species that interact closely, often over a long period of time. Symbiosis includes three types of interactions—[[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], [[commensalism]], and [[parasitism]]—of which only mutualism can sometimes qualify as cooperation. Mutualism involves a close, mutually beneficial interaction between two different biological species, whereas "cooperation" is a more general term that can involve looser interactions and can be interspecific (between species) or intraspecific (within a species). In commensalism, one of the two participating species benefits, while the other is neither harmed nor benefitted. In parasitism, one of the two participating species benefits at the expense of the other.

Symbiosis may be obligate or facultative. In obligate symbiosis, one or both species depends on the other for survival. In facultative symbiosis, the symbiotic interaction is not necessary for the survival of either species.

Two special types of symbiosis include [[endosymbiont|endosymbiosis]], in which one species lives inside of another, and ectosymbiosis, in which one species lives on another.

=== Mutualism ===
[[File:Rhizobia nodules on Vigna unguiculata.jpg|thumb|[[Rhizobia]] nodules on ''[[Vigna unguiculata]]'']]

[[Mutualism (biology)|Mutualism]] is a form of symbiosis in which both participating species benefit.

A classic example of mutualism is the interaction between [[rhizobia]] soil bacteria and legumes ([[Fabaceae]]). In this interaction, rhizobia bacteria induce root nodule formation in legume plants via an exchange of molecular signals.&lt;ref name="Advances in Agronomy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=F|last2=Smith|first2=D. L |year=2002 |title=Interorganismal signaling in suboptimum environments: The legume-rhizobia symbiosis |journal=Advances in Agronomy |volume=76 |pages=125–161 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2113(02)76004-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the root nodules, rhizobia fix atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia using the [[nitrogenase]] enzyme. The legume benefits from a new supply of usable nitrogen from the rhizobia, and the rhizobia benefits from organic acid energy sources from the plant as well as the protection provided by the root nodule. Since the rhizobia live within the legume, this is an example of endosymbiosis, and since both the bacteria and the plant can survive independently, it is also an example of facultative symbiosis.

[[Lichen]]s are another example of mutualism. Lichens consist of a [[fungus]] (the mycobiont) and a photosynthetic partner (the photobiont), which is usually a [[green alga]] or a [[cyanobacteria]]. The mycobiont benefits from the sugar products of [[photosynthesis]] generated by the photobiont, and the photobiont benefits from the increased water retention and increased surface area to capture water and mineral nutrients conferred by the mycobiont. Many lichens are examples of obligate symbiosis. In fact, one-fifth of all known extant fungal species form obligate symbiotic associations with green algae, cyanobacteria or both.&lt;ref name="Lichens"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lutzoni|first1=François|last2=Pagel|first2=Mark|last3=Reeb|first3=Valérie |year=2001 |title=Major fungal lineages are derived from lichen symbiotic ancestors |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6840 |pages=937–940 |doi=10.1038/35082053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all examples of mutualism are also examples of cooperation. Specifically, in by-product mutualism, both participants benefit, but cooperation is not involved. For example, when an elephant defecates, this is beneficial to the elephant as a way to empty waste, and it is also beneficial to a dung beetle that uses the elephant's dung. However, neither participant's behavior yields a benefit from the other, and thus cooperation is not taking place.&lt;ref name="Elephant Dung"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Connor |first1=R. C. |title=Cooperation beyond the dyad: on simple models and a complex society |year=2010 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=365 |issue=1553 |pages=2687–2697 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0150 |pmid=20679112 |pmc=2936175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hidden benefits ==

'''Hidden benefits''' are benefits from cooperation that are not obvious because they are obscure or delayed. (For example, a hidden benefit would not involve an increase in the number of offspring or offspring viability.)

One example of a hidden benefit involves ''Malarus cyaneus'', the [[superb fairy-wren]]. In ''M. cyaneus'', the presence of helpers at the nest does not lead to an increase in chick mass. However, the presence of helpers does confer a hidden benefit: it increases the chance that a mother will survive to breed in the next year.&lt;ref name="Behavioral Ecology 2012"/&gt;

Another example of a hidden benefit is indirect reciprocity, in which a donor individual helps a beneficiary to increase the probability that observers will invest in the donor in the future, even when the donor will have no further interaction with the beneficiary.

In a study of 79 students, participants played a game in which they could repeatedly give money to others and receive from others. They were told that they would never interact with the same person in the reciprocal role. A player's history of donating was displayed at each anonymous interaction, and donations were significantly more frequent to receivers who had been generous to others in earlier interactions.&lt;ref name="Cooperation Through Image Scoring"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wedekind|first1=C. |year=2000 |title=Cooperation Through Image Scoring in Humans |journal=Science|volume=288 |issue=5467 |pages=850–852 |doi=10.1126/science.288.5467.850 |pmid=10797005|bibcode=2000Sci...288..850W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect reciprocity has only been shown to occur in humans.&lt;ref name="Behavioural Processes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bergmüller|first1=Ralph|last2=Johnstone|first2=Rufus A.|last3=Russell|first3=Andrew F.|last4=Bshary|first4=Redouan |year=2007 |title=Integrating cooperative breeding into theoretical concepts of cooperation |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=61–72 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2007.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prisoner's dilemma==
{{main|Prisoner's dilemma}}

[[Image:Canis lupus pack surrounding Bison.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Cooperative hunting by wolves allows them to tackle much larger and more nutritious prey than any individual wolf could handle. However, such cooperation could, potentially, be exploited by selfish individuals who do not expose themselves to the dangers of the hunt, but nevertheless share in the spoils.]]
Even if all members of a group benefit from cooperation, individual self-interest may not favor cooperation. The [[prisoner's dilemma]] codifies this problem and has been the subject of much research, both theoretical and experimental. In its original form the prisoner's dilemma game (PDG) described two awaiting trial prisoners, A and B, each faced with the choice of betraying the other or remaining silent. The "[[Game theory|game]]" has four possible outcomes: (a) they both betray each other, and are both sentenced to two years in prison; (b) A betrays B, which sets A free and B is sentenced to four years in prison; (c) B betrays A, with the same result as (b) except that it is B who is set free and the other spends four years in jail; (d) both remain silent, resulting in a six-month sentence each. Clearly (d) ("cooperation") is the best mutual strategy, but from the point of view of the individual betrayal is unbeatable (resulting in being set free, or getting only a two-year sentence). Remaining silent results in a four-year or six-month sentence. This is exemplified by a further example of the PDG: two strangers attend a restaurant together and decide to split the bill. The mutually best ploy would be for both parties to order the cheapest items on the menu (mutual cooperation). But if one member of the party exploits the situation by ordering the most expensive items, then it is best for the other member to do likewise. In fact, if the fellow diner's personality is completely unknown, and the two diners are unlikely ever to meet again, it is always in one's own best interests to eat as expensively as possible. Situations in nature that are subject to the same dynamics (rewards and penalties) as the PDG define cooperative behavior: it is never in the individual's fitness interests to cooperate, even though mutual cooperation rewards the two contestants (together) more highly than any other strategy.&lt;ref name=sigmund&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sigmund|first1 =K.|title=Games of Life.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=|pages=180–206|url= |chapter= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nash equilibrium#Prisoner's dilemma|Cooperation cannot evolve under these circumstances]].

However, in 1981 [[Robert Axelrod|Axelrod]] and [[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]]&lt;ref name=axelrod&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.7466396|last1=Axelrod |first1=R.|last2=Hamilton|first2=W.D.|year = 1981 | title = The evolution of cooperation|url = | journal = Science |volume = 211 | issue =|pages = 1390–1396 |pmid = 7466396| bibcode=1981Sci...211.1390A}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that if the same contestants in the PDG meet repeatedly (in the so-called iterated prisoner's dilemma game, IPD) then tit-for-tat (foreshadowed by [[Robert Trivers]]' 1971 reciprocal altruism theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1086/406755|last=Trivers|first= R.L.|year=1971|title=The evolution of reciprocal altruism|journal=Quarterly Review of Biology| volume= 46|pages= 35–57|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a robust strategy which promotes altruism.&lt;ref name=sigmund /&gt;&lt;ref name=axelrod /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard Smith|first1 =J.|title=Evolutionary Genetics|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198542151|pages=168–169, 181–183|url= |chapter=Evolution in structured populations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "tit-for-tat" both players' opening moves are cooperation. Thereafter each contestant repeats the other player's last move, resulting in a seemingly endless sequence of mutually cooperative moves. However, mistakes severely undermine tit-for-tat's effectiveness, giving rise to prolonged sequences of betrayal, which can only be rectified by another mistake. Since these initial discoveries, all the other possible IPD game strategies have been identified (16 possibilities in all, including, for instance, "generous tit-for-tat", which behaves like "tit-for-tat", except that it cooperates with a small probability when the opponent's last move was "betray".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Godfray, H.

Results from [[experimental economics]] show, however, that humans often act more cooperatively than strict self-interest would dictate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=van den Assem | author2=van Dolder | author3=Thaler | title=''Split or Steal''?

==Evolutionary mechanisms suggesting that reciprocity is the result, not the cause, of the evolution of cooperation ==
In the light of the iterated prisoner's dilemma game and the reciprocal altruism theory failing to provide full answers to the evolutionary stability of cooperation, several alternative explanations have been proposed.
[[File:Paonroue.JPG|thumb|left|300px|A male peacock with its beautiful but clumsy, aerodynamically unsound erectile tail, which [[Amotz Zahavi]] believes is a handicap, comparable to a race horse's handicap. The larger the handicap the more intrinsically fit the individual (see text).]]

There are striking parallels between cooperative behavior and exaggerated [[Sexual selection|sexual ornaments]] displayed by some animals, particularly certain birds, such as, amongst others, the [[Peafowl|peacock]]. Both are costly in fitness terms, and both are generally conspicuous to other members of the population or species. This led [[Amotz Zahavi]] to suggest that both might be [[Signalling theory|fitness signals]] rendered evolutionarily stable by his [[handicap principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1975 |title=Mate selection—a selection for a handicap |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=205–214 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3 |pmid=1195756}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zahavi&gt;{{cite journal |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1977 |title=The cost of honesty (Further remarks on the handicap principle) |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=603–605 |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(77)90061-3 |pmid=904334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Amotz |last=Zahavi |year=1997 |title=The handicap principle: a missing piece of Darwin's puzzle |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-510035-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a signal is to remain reliable, and generally resistant to falsification, [[Signalling theory#The sports handicapping metaphor|the signal]] has to be evolutionarily costly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=A. |year=1990 |title=Biological signals as handicaps |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=144 |issue=4 |pages=517–546 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80088-8 |pmid=2402153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if a (low fitness) liar were to use the highly costly signal, which seriously eroded its real fitness, it would find it difficult to maintain a semblance or normality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnstone |first=RA |first2=A |last2=Grafen |year=1993 |title=Dishonesty and the handicap principle |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=759–764 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zahavi borrowed the term "handicap principle" from sports handicapping systems. These systems are aimed at reducing disparities in performance, thereby making the outcome of contests less predictable. In a horse [[Handicap (horse racing)|handicap race]], provenly faster horses are given heavier weights to carry under their saddles than inherently slower horses. Similarly, in [[Golf handicap|amateur golf]], better golfers have fewer strokes subtracted from their raw scores than the less talented players. The handicap therefore correlates with unhandicapped performance, making it possible, if one knows nothing about the horses, to predict which unhandicapped horse would win an open race. It would be the one handicapped with the greatest weight in the saddle. The handicaps in nature are highly visible, and therefore a peahen, for instance, would be able to deduce the health of a potential mate by comparing its handicap (the size of the peacock's tail) with those of the other males. The loss of the male's fitness caused by the handicap is offset by his increased access to females, which is as much of a fitness concern as is his health. A cooperative act is, by definition, similarly costly (e.g. helping raise the young at the nest of an unrelated pair of birds versus producing and raising one's own offspring). It would therefore also signal fitness, and is probably as attractive to females as a physical handicap. If this is the case, cooperation is evolutionarily stabilized by [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name=zahavi /&gt;

There is an alternate strategy for identifying fit mates which does not rely on one gender having exaggerated sexual ornaments or other handicaps, but is probably generally applicable to most, if not all sexual creatures. It derives from the concept that the change in appearance and functionality caused by a [[Silent mutation|non-silent]] [[mutation]] will generally stand out in a population. This is because that altered appearance and functionality will be unusual, peculiar, and different from the norm within that population. The norm against which these unusual features are judged is made up of fit attributes that have attained their plurality through [[natural selection]], while less well adapted attributes will be in the minority or frankly rare.&lt;ref name=fisher&gt;Fisher R. (1930) ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection''.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the overwhelming majority of mutant features are maladaptive, and it is impossible to predict evolution's future direction, sexual creatures would be expected to [[Koinophilia|prefer mates with the least number of unusual or minority features]].&lt;ref name=fisher /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symons, D.

They will all very quickly begin to look remarkably similar to one another in every detail, as illustrated in the accompanying photograph of the [[African pygmy kingfisher]], ''Ispidina picta''. Once a population has become as homogeneous in appearance as is typical of most species, its entire repertoire of behaviors will also be rendered [[Evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionarily stable]], including any cooperative, altruistic and social interactions. Thus, in the example [[Co-operation (evolution)#The Prisoner's Dilemma|above]] of the selfish individual who hangs back from the rest of the hunting pack, but who nevertheless joins in the spoils, that individual will be recognized as being different from the norm, and will therefore find it difficult to attract a mate ([[koinophilia]]).&lt;ref name= "Koeslag, 1990" /&gt; Its genes will therefore have only a very small probability of being passed on to the next generation, thus evolutionarily stabilizing cooperation and social interactions at whatever level of complexity is the norm in that population.&lt;ref name=koeslag1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00188-7|last1 = Koeslag|first1 = J.H.| year = 2003 |title = Evolution of cooperation: cooperation defeats defection in the cornfield model |url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology| volume = 224 |issue = | pages = 399–410 |pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of cooperation research ==

One of the first references to animal cooperation was made by [[Charles Darwin]], who noted it as a potential problem for his theory of natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. ''The Origin of Species'' Ch VIII (The Modern Library, 1859/1958)&lt;/ref&gt; In most of the 19th century, intellectuals like [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]] debated fervently on whether animals cooperate with one another and whether animals displayed altruistic behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dugatkin | first1 = L. A. | year = 2002 | title = Animal cooperation among unrelated individuals | doi = 10.1007/s00114-002-0379-y | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 89 | issue = 12| pages = 533–41 | bibcode = 2002NW.....89..533D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1900s, some early research in animal cooperation focused on the benefits of group-living. While living in a group produces costs in the form of increased frequency of predator attacks and greater mating competition, some animals find that the benefits outweigh the costs. Animals that practice group-living often benefit from assistance in parasite removal, access to more mates, and conservation of energy in foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alexander | first1 = R. | year = 1974 | title = The evolution of social behavior | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 325–83 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.05.110174.001545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the most obvious form of animal cooperation was [[Cooperation#Kin selection|kin selection]], but more recent studies focus on non-kin cooperation, where benefits may seem less obvious. Non-kin cooperation often involves many strategies that include manipulation and coercion, making these interactions more complicated to study.&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock 2009 51–57" /&gt; An example of manipulation is presented by the cuckoo, a [[brood parasite]], which lays its eggs in the nest of a bird of another species.&lt;ref name="Behavioral Ecology 2012"/&gt; That bird then is tricked into feeding and caring for the cuckoo offspring. Although this phenomenon may look like cooperation at first glance, it only presents benefits to one recipient.

In the past, simple [[game theory]] models, such as the classic cooperative hunting and [[Prisoner's dilemma]] models, were used to determine decisions made by animals in cooperative relationships. However, complicated interactions between animals have required the use of more complex economic models such as the [[Nash equilibrium]]. The [[Nash equilibrium]] is a type of non-cooperative game theory that assumes an individual's decision is influenced by its knowledge of the strategies of other individuals. This theory was novel because it took into consideration the higher cognitive capabilities of animals.&lt;ref&gt;Noë, R., van Hooff, J., and Hammerstein, P. ''Economics in Nature: Social Dilemmas, Mate Choice and Biological Markets'' Cambridge University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mesterton-Gibbons | first1 = M. | last2 = Adams | first2 = E.S. | year = 2002 | title = The Economics of Animal Cooperation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5601| pages = 2146–7 | doi=10.1126/science.1080051}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] is a refined version of the [[Nash equilibrium]] in that it assumes strategies are heritable and are subject to natural selection. Economic models are useful for analyzing cooperative relationships because they provide predictions on how individuals act when cooperation is an option. Economic models are not perfect, but they provide a general idea of how cooperative relationships work.

[[Image:201 Elements of the Human Body-01.jpg|thumb|right|500px|The main elements that compose the human body are shown from most abundant (by mass, not by fraction of atoms) to least abundant.]]

Body composition may be analyzed in terms of molecular type e.g., [[water]], [[protein]], [[connective tissue]], [[fat]]s (or [[lipid]]s), [[hydroxylapatite]] (in bones), [[carbohydrates]] (such as [[glycogen]] and [[glucose]]) and [[DNA]]. In terms of tissue type, the body may be analyzed into water, fat, muscle, bone, etc. In terms of cell type, the body contains hundreds of different types of cells, but notably, the largest ''number'' of cells contained in a human body (though not the largest mass of cells) are not human cells, but bacteria residing in the normal human gastrointestinal tract.

==Elements==
[[File:Two pie graphs about the composition of the human body.png|thumb|300px|Pie charts of typical human body composition by percent of mass, and by percent of atomic composition (atomic percent).]]
Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: [[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[calcium]], and [[phosphorus]]. Only about 0.85% is composed of another five elements: [[potassium]], [[sulfur]], [[sodium]], [[chlorine]], and [[magnesium]]. All 11 are necessary for life. The remaining elements are [[trace element]]s, of which more than a dozen are thought on the basis of good evidence to be necessary for life. All of the mass of the trace elements put together (less than 10 grams for a human body) do not add up to the body mass of magnesium, the least common of the 11 non-trace elements.

===Other elements===
Not all elements which are found in the human body in trace quantities play a role in life. Some of these elements are thought to be simple bystander contaminants without function (examples: caesium, titanium), while many others are thought to be active toxics, depending on amount (cadmium, mercury, radioactives). The possible utility and toxicity of a few elements at levels normally found in the body (aluminium) is debated. Functions have been proposed for trace amounts of cadmium and lead, although these are almost certainly toxic in amounts very much larger than normally found in the body. There is evidence that arsenic, an element normally considered a toxin in higher amounts, is essential in ultratrace quantities, in mammals such as rats, hamsters, and goats.&lt;ref name="Anke M. Arsenic 1986"&gt;Anke M. "Arsenic". In: Mertz W. ed., ''Trace elements in human and Animal Nutrition'', 5th ed. Orlando, FL: Academic Press, 1986, 347-372; Uthus E. O., "Evidency for arsenical essentiality", ''Environmental Geochemistry and Health'', 1992, 14:54-56; Uthus E.O., Arsenic essentiality and factors affecting its importance. In: Chappell W. R., Abernathy C. O., Cothern C. R. eds., ''Arsenic Exposure and Health''. Northwood, UK: Science and Technology Letters, 1994, 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements  (silicon, boron, nickel, vanadium) are probably needed by mammals also, but in far smaller doses. Bromine is used abundantly by some (though not all) lower organisms, and opportunistically in [[eosinophil]]s in humans. One study has found bromine to be necessary to collagen IV synthesis in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid24906154"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=McCall AS, Cummings CF, Bhave G, Vanacore R, Page-McCaw A, Hudson BG |title = Bromine Is an Essential Trace Element for Assembly of Collagen IV Scaffolds in Tissue Development and Architecture|journal = Cell|volume = 157|issue = 6|pages = 1380–92|year = 2014|pmid = 24906154|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.009|pmc=4144415}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluorine]] is used by a number of plants to manufacture toxins (see that element) but in humans only functions as a local (topical) hardening agent in tooth enamel, and not in an essential biological role.&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger, Cox |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elemental composition list===
{{main article|Dietary element}}
The average {{convert|70|kg|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Human body|adult human body]] contains approximately {{val|7|e=27}} [[atom]]s and contains at least detectable traces of 60 [[chemical element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.jlab.org/qa/mathatom_04.html How many atoms are in the human body?]&lt;/ref&gt; About 29 of these elements are thought to play an active positive role in life and health in humans.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;"Ultratrace minerals". Authors: Nielsen, Forrest H. USDA, ARS Source: ''Modern nutrition in health and disease'' / editors, Maurice E. Shils ... et al.. Baltimore : Williams &amp; Wilkins, c. 1999, p. 283-303. Issue Date: 1999 URI: [http://hdl.handle.net/10113/46493]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative amounts of each element vary by individual, mainly due to differences in the proportion of fat, muscle and bone in their body. Persons with more fat will have a higher proportion of carbon and a lower proportion of most other elements (the proportion of hydrogen will be about the same).
The numbers in the table are averages of different numbers reported by different references.

The adult human body averages ~53% water.{{fv|date=July 2018|reason=Not in the source cited. And if this was obtained by averaging the male and female averages, then it's a terrible math and incorrect}} This varies substantially by age, sex, and adiposity. In a large sample of adults of all ages and both sexes, the figure for water fraction by weight was found to be 48 ±6% for females and 58 ±8% water for males.&lt;ref name="here"&gt;See table 1. [http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/33/1/27.full.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Water is ~11% hydrogen by [[mass]] but ~67% hydrogen by [[atomic percent]], and these numbers along with the complementary % numbers for oxygen in water, are the largest contributors to overall mass and atomic composition figures. Because of water content, the human body contains more oxygen by mass than any other element, but more hydrogen by atom-fraction than any element.

The elements listed below as "Essential in humans" are those listed by the (US) [[Food and Drug Administration]] as essential nutrients,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064928.htm "Guidance for Industry: A Food Labeling Guide 14. Appendix F"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as six additional elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen (the fundamental building blocks of life on Earth), sulfur (essential to all cells) and cobalt (a necessary component of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). Elements listed as "Possibly" or "Probably" essential are those cited by the [[National Research Council (United States)]] as beneficial to human health and possibly or probably essential.&lt;ref name="Medicine2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Institute of Medicine|title=Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYZZTgjDeccC&amp;pg=PA415|accessdate=21 June 2016|date=29 September 2006|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-15742-1|pages=313–19, 415–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 94 naturally occurring chemical elements, 60 are listed in the table above. Of the remaining 34, it is not known how many occur in the human body.

Most of the elements needed for life are relatively [[abundance of the chemical elements|common in the Earth's crust]]. [[Aluminium]], the third most common element in the [[Earth's crust]] (after [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]]), serves no function in living cells, but is harmful in large amounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=164929 Aluminum Toxicity]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transferrin]]s can bind aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mizutani | first1 = K. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = B. | last3 = Aibara | first3 = S. | last4 = Hirose | first4 = M. | title = Structure of aluminium-bound ovotransferrin at 2.15 Å resolution | doi = 10.1107/S090744490503266X | journal = Acta Crystallographica Section D | volume = 61 | issue = 12 | pages = 1636 | year = 2005 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Botany.jpg|upright|thumb|right|300px|Some of the traditional tools of cultivated plant taxonomy including: microscope, camera, flowers and book to assist identification.]]
'''Cultivated plant taxonomy''' is the study of the [[theory]] and practice of the [[science]] that identifies, describes, classifies, and names [[cultigen]]s&amp;mdash;those plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to intentional human activity. Cultivated plant taxonomists do, however, work with all kinds of plants in cultivation.

Cultivated plant taxonomy is one part of the study of [[horticultural botany]] which is mostly carried out in [[botanical garden]]s, large nurseries, universities, or government departments. Areas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation ([[plant collecting|plant hunting]]); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the [[Biological classification|classification]] and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions ([[horticultural flora]]s); maintaining databases, [[herbarium|herbaria]] and other information about cultivated plants.

Much of the work of the cultivated plant taxonomist is concerned with the naming of plants as prescribed by two plant nomenclatural Codes. The provisions of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (''Botanical Code'') serve primarily scientific ends and the objectives of the scientific community, while those of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]'' (''Cultivated Plant Code'') are designed to serve both scientific and utilitarian ends by making provision for the names of plants used in commerce—the cultigens that have arisen in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. These names, sometimes called variety names, are not in Latin but are added onto the scientific Latin names, and they assist communication among the community of foresters, farmers and horticulturists.

The history of cultivated plant taxonomy can be traced from the first plant selections that occurred during the agrarian [[Neolithic Revolution]] to the first recorded naming of human plant selections by the Romans. The naming and classification of cultigens followed a similar path to that of all plants until the establishment of the first ''Cultivated Plant Code'' in 1953 which formally established the cultigen classification category of cultivar. Since that time the classification and naming of cultigens has followed its own path.

==Distinctive characteristics==
{{further|Cultivar|Cultivar group|l2=Group|Grex (horticulture)|l3=Grex}}
Cultivated plant [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] has been distinguished from the taxonomy of other plants in at least five ways. Firstly, there is a distinction made according to ''where the plants are growing'' — that is, whether they are wild or cultivated. This is alluded to by the ''[[Cultivated Plant Code]]'' which specifies in its title that it is dealing with ''cultivated plants''. Secondly, a distinction is made according to ''how the plants originated''. This is indicated in Principle 2 of the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' which defines the scope of the Code as "... ''plants whose origin or selection is primarily due to the intentional actions of mankind''"&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  — plants that have evolved under natural selection with human assistance.Thirdly, cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with plant variation that requires the use of special classification categories that do not conform with the hierarchy of ranks implicit in the ''[[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|Botanical Code]]'', these categories being the [[cultivar]], [[Cultivar group|Group]] and [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]] (which are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the ''Botanical Code'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2004|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is also referred to in the Preamble to the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' which states that "''The purpose of giving a name to a taxon is not to indicate its characters or history, but to supply a means of referring to it and to indicate to which category it is assigned.''"&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fourthly, cultivated plant taxonomy serves a particular community of people: the ''Botanical Code'' focuses on the needs of plant taxonomists as they attempt to maintain order and stability for the scientific names of all plants, while the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' caters for the needs of people requiring names for plants used in the commercial world of agriculture, forestry and horticulture.&lt;ref name="Spencer 2008 165"&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|2008|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the difference between cultivated plant taxonomy and the taxonomy of other plants has been attributed to the purpose for which the taxonomy has been devised, it being plant-centred in the ''Botanical Code'' and human-centred in the ''Cultivated Plant Code''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2008|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific and anthropocentric classification==
{{Main article|Plant taxonomy}}

The key activities of cultivated plant taxonomy relate to classification ([[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]) and naming ([[nomenclature]]). The rules associated with naming plants are separate from the methods, principles or purposes of classification, except that the units of classification, the [[taxa]], are placed in a [[hierarchy|nested hierarchy]] of [[Taxonomic rank|rank]]s – like species within genera, and genera within families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2004|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three classification categories used in the ''Cultivated Plant Code'', the [[cultivar]] and the [[Cultivar group|Group]] and the [[Grex (horticulture)|grex]], but they are only loosely equivalent to ranks in the ''Botanical Code''.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, Articles 2 &amp; 3  {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of the ancient world, at least, plants have been classified in two ways. On the one hand there is the detached academic, philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves: this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function. Then there is the practical, [[utilitarian]] or [[anthropocentric]] interest which groups plants according to their human use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arber|1986|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture, horticulture and forestry as regulated by the ''Cultivated Plant Code''. This Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature, it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce.&lt;ref name="Spencer 2008 165"/&gt; Those cultigens given names governed by the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' fulfill three criteria: they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations (except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name); it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|Lumley|2007|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms ''cultigen'' and ''cultivar'' may be confused with each other. ''Cultigen'' is a general-purpose term for plants that have been deliberately altered or specially selected by humans, while cultivar is a formal classification category. Cultigens include not only plants with cultivar names but also those with names in the classification categories of grex and Group. The ''Cultivated Plant Code'' points out that cultigens are: ''deliberately selected plants that may have arisen by intentional or accidental hybridization in cultivation, by selection from existing cultivated stocks, or from variants within wild populations that are maintained as recognizable entities solely by continued propagation.''&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code Art. 2.3 {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included within the group of plants known as cultigens are [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] plants, plants with binomial Latin names that are the result of ancient human selection, and any plants that have been altered by humans but which have not been given formal names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|Lumley|2007|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice most cultigens are cultivars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross| Lumley|2007|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following account of the historical development of cultivated plant taxonomy traces the way cultigens have arisen and been incorporated into botanical science; it also demonstrates how two approaches to plant nomenclature and classification have led to the present-day ''International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants'' and ''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants''.

==Historical development==
{{Main article|History of botany}} 
The history of cultigen nomenclature has been discussed by [[William T. Stearn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1965a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1965b|pp=279–291, 322–341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1986|pp=19–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brandenberg, Hetterscheid and Berg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brandenburg|1986|pp=109–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hetterscheid|van den Berg|Brandenburg|1996|pp=123–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been examined from a botanical perspective&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2004|pp=25–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the origin of the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' in 1953 until 2004.&lt;ref name="Trehane 2004 17–27"&gt;{{Harvnb|Trehane|2004|pp=17–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early development of cultigen taxonomy follows that of plant taxonomy in general as the early listing and documentation of plants made little distinction between those that were [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and those that were natural wild kinds. Formal [[botanical nomenclature]] and classification evolved from the simple [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] system of [[folk taxonomy]] and it was not until the mid-19th century that the nomenclatural path of cultigens began to diverge from mainstream plant taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|Lumley|2007|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===10,000 to 400 BCE – plant domestication===
{{Main article|Neolithic Revolution}}
[[File:ClaySumerianSickle.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sumer]]ian harvester's sickle made from baked clay and dated to about 3000 BCE.]] 
William T. Stearn (1911–2001), taxonomic botanist, classical scholar and author of the book ''Botanical Latin'' has commented that "cultivated plants [cultigens] are mankind's most vital and precious heritage from remote antiquity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1965|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cultigens of our most common economic plants probably date back to the first settled communities of the [[Neolithic Revolution]] 10,000 to 12,000 years ago although their exact time and place of true origin will probably remain a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Western world among the first cultigens would have been selections of the cereals [[wheat]] and [[barley]] that arose in the early settlements of the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the fertile river valleys of the Nile, Tigris and Euphrates) in the Western Mediterranean. Food plant selections would also have been made in the ten or so other centres of settlement that occurred around the world at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confining crops to local areas gave rise to [[landrace]]s (selections that are highly adapted to local conditions) although these are now largely replaced by modern cultivars. [[Cutting (plant)|Cutting]]s are an extremely effective way of perpetuating desirable characters, especially of woody plants like [[grape]]s, [[ficus|fig]]s and [[olive]]s so it is not surprising that these are among the first known plant selections perpetuated in cultivation in the West.&lt;ref name="Stearn 1986 19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1986|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrating people would take their plant seeds and cuttings with them; there is evidence of early Fertile Crescent cereal cultigens being transferred from Western Asia to surrounding lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn| 1965|p=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===400 BCE to 1400 – the ancient world: Greco-Roman influence to the Middle Ages===
{{Main article|History of botany}}
[[File:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|75px|Aristotle (384–322 BCE)]]
As early as the 5th century [[BCE]] the Greek philosopher [[Hippo (philosopher)|Hippo]] expressed the opinion that cultigens (as we call them now) were produced from wild plants as the result of the care bestowed on them by man, a revolutionary view at a time when they were regarded as the special creation and gift of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In devising ways of classifying organisms the philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BCE) established the important idea of a ''fundamentum divisionis'' — the principle that groups can be progressively subdivided. This has been assumed in [[biological classification]] ever since and is congruent with the relatively recent idea of evolution as descent with modification. All biological classification follows this principle of groups within groups, known as a [[hierarchy|nested hierarchy]], but this form of classification does not necessarily presuppose evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stuessy|2009|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Theophrastus2.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Theophrastus (371–286 BCE)]] The earliest scientific (rather than utilitarian) approach to plants is attributed to Aristotle's student [[Theophrastus]] (371–286 BCE), known as the "father of botany".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stace|1984|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Enquiry into Plants'' Theophrastus described 480 kinds of plant, dividing the plant kingdom into [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, undershrubs and [[herb]]s with further subdivision into [[wildlife|wild]] and [[Horticulture|cultivated]], [[flowering]] and non-flowering, [[deciduous]] or [[evergreen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Theophrastus|1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utilitarian approach, classifying plants according to their medicinal properties, is exemplified by the work of Roman nobleman, scientist and historian, [[Pliny the Elder]] (29–79 CE) author of ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis historiae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+toc Pliny's ''Naturalis historiae'' Retrieved: 2010-08-05]&lt;/ref&gt; "Cultivars" listed here are named after people, places or special plant characteristics. Most notable is the work of Dioscorides (ca.40–ca.90 CE) a Greek doctor who worked with the Roman army. His five-volume ''Materia Medica''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancerlynx.com/dioscorides.html Dioscorides' ''Materia Medica'' Retrieved: 2010-08-05]&lt;/ref&gt; was a forerunner of the [[herbal]] which led to the modern [[pharmacopoeia]]. This work was endlessly plagiarised by later herbals including those printed between about 1470 and 1670 CE: it listed 600 to 1000 different kinds of plants including the cultigens [[Rosa gallica|Gallica]], [[Rosa centifolia|Centifolia]], the rose of uncertain origin known as Alba and other rose cultivars grown by the Romans.
[[File:Pliny the Elder.png|thumb|left|100px|Pliny the Elder (29–79 CE)]]
The first record of a named cultigen occurs in ''[[De Agri Cultura]]''.&lt;ref name="Stearn 1986 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/home.html Marcus Cato's ''De Agri Cultura'' Retrieved: 2010-08-05]&lt;/ref&gt; written about 160 BCE by Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]] (234–149 BCE) in a list that includes 120 kinds (cultivars) of figs, grapes, apples and olives.&lt;ref name="Stearn 1986 19"/&gt; The names are presented in a way that implies that they would have been familiar to fellow Romans. The "cultivar" names were mostly of one word and denoted the provenance of the cultivar (the geographical origin of the place where the plant selections were made).&lt;ref name="Stearn 1986 20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1986|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers up to the 15th century added little to this early work. In the Middle Ages the [[book of hours]], early herbals, [[illuminated manuscript]]s and economic records indicate that plants grown by the Romans found their way into monastery gardens. For example, in 827 CE the following herbs were mentioned in the poem ''Hortulus'' by [[Walafrid Strabo]] as growing in the monastery garden of [[St Gallen]] in Switzerland: [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], [[Common rue|rue]], [[southernwood]], [[Artemisia absinthium|wormwood]], [[Marrubium vulgare|horehound]], [[Foeniculum vulgare|fennel]], [[Iris germanica|German iris]], [[lovage]], [[chervil]], [[Madonna lily]], [[Papaver somniferum|opium poppy]], [[Salvia sclarea|clary]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[Stachys|betony]], [[agrimony]], [[Nepeta cataria|catmint]], [[radish]], [[Rosa gallica|gallica rose]], [[Calabash|bottle gourd]] and [[melon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1965|p=324}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seems likely that aromatic and culinary herbs were quite widespread and similar lists of plants occur in records of plants grown in Villa gardens at the time of [[Charlemagne]] (742–814 CE).&lt;ref name="Stearn 1986 20"/&gt;

===1400 to 1700 – Renaissance, imperial expansion, herbals===
{{Main article|Herbal}}
[[File:Bauhin Gaspard 1550-1624.jpg|thumb|75px|right|Caspar Bauhin (1550–1624)]]
The revival of learning during the [[Renaissance]] reinvigorated the study of plants and their classification. From about 1400 CE European expansion established Latin as the common language of scholars and it was adopted for biological nomenclature. Then, from about 1500 CE, the publication of herbals (books often illustrated with woodcuts describing the appearance, medicinal properties, and other characteristics of plants used in herbal medicine) extended the formal documentation of plants and by the late 16th century the number of different plant kinds described in Europe had risen to about 4,000. In 1623 [[Gaspard Bauhin]] published his ''Pinax theatre botanici''&lt;ref&gt;[http://edb.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/exhibit-e/b07/b07cont.html Caspar Bauhin's ''Pinax theatre botanici'' Retrieved: 2010-08-05]&lt;/ref&gt; an attempt at a comprehensive compilation of all plants known at that time: it included about 6000 kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The combined works of a German physician and botanist [[Valerius Cordus]] (1515–1544 CE) which were published in 1562 included many named "cultivars" including 30 apples and 49 pears, presumably local German selections.&lt;ref name="Stearn 1986 20"/&gt;  English herbalist [[John Parkinson (botanist)|John Parkinson]]'s ''Paradisi in Sole ...'' (1629) lists 57 apple "cultivars", 62 pears, 61 plums, 35 cherries and 22 peaches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/paradisiinsolepa00parkrich John Parkinson's Paradisi in Sole … Retrieved: 2011-05-04]&lt;/ref&gt;

With increasing trade in economic and medicinal plants the need for a more comprehensive classification system increased. Up to about 1650 CE plants had been grouped either alphabetically or according to utilitarian [[folk taxonomy]] – by their medicinal uses or whether they were trees, shrubs or herbs. Between 1650 and 1700 CE there was a move from the utilitarian back to a scientific natural classification based on the characters of the plants themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=165–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1700 to 1750 – dawn of scientific classification===
{{Main article|History of plant systematics}}
In 1700 French botanist [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort|J.P. de Tournefort]]  although still using the broad  groupings of "trees" and "herbs" for flowering plants, began to use flower characteristics as distinguishing features and, most importantly, provided a clear definition of the genus as a basic unit of classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Institutiones Rei Herbariae'' he listed about 10,000 different plants, which he called species, organised into 698 genera with illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of this precursor of scientific classification vastly improved the organisation of plant variation into approximately equivalent groups or ranks and many of his genera were later taken up by [[Carl Linnaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morton|1981|pp=197–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There was still at this time no common agreement on the way to present plant names so they ranged in length from one word to lengthy descriptive sentences. As the number of recorded plants increased this naming system became more unwieldy.

In England the tradition of documenting garden plants was established long before Linnaeus' ''Species Plantarum'' starting with the herbals, but the most prominent early chronicler was [[Philip Miller]] (1691–1771) who was a master gardener in charge of the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] in London from 1722 to 1770. New plants were coming into Western Europe from southern Europe and the overseas colonies of the Dutch, British and French. These new plants came largely to the botanic gardens of Amsterdam, Leiden, Chelsea and Paris and they needed recording. In 1724 Miller produced a two-volume compendium of garden plants called ''The Gardeners and Florists Dictionary or a complete System of Horticulture''. The first edition was in 1724, subsequently revised and enlarged until the last and 8th edition in 1768 by which time he had adopted Linnaean binomials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|1754}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a while this publication was taken as the starting point for "horticultural" nomenclature equivalent to Linnaeus' ''Species Plantarum'' which is now taken as the starting point for botanical nomenclature in general. Miller's Dictionary was the first of many English horticultural compendia whose history has been traced by William Stearn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1992|pp=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1750 to 1800 – Linnaeus and binomial nomenclature===
{{further|Carl Linnaeus|Binomial nomenclature}}
[[File:Carl von Linné.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Carl Linnaeus]]  (1707–1778) who established the binomial system of plant nomenclature.]] In the early 18th century colonial expansion and exploration created a demand for the description of thousands of new organisms. This highlighted difficulties in communication about plants, the replication of their descriptions, and the importance of an agreed way of presenting, publishing and applying their names.

It was the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus who finally put order into this situation as he attempted to name all the known organisms of his day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://huntbot.andrew.cmu.edu/HIBD/Exhibitions/OrderFromChaos/OFC-Pages/02Linnaeus/system.shtml Hunt Botanic Garden account of Linnaeus' work. Retrieved: 2010-08-05] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120711040237/http://huntbot.andrew.cmu.edu/HIBD/Exhibitions/OrderFromChaos/OFC-Pages/02Linnaeus/system.shtml |date=2012-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1735 his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ix0AAAAAQAAJ Linnaeus' ''Systema Naturae'' 13th edition (Volume I,532 pages) Retrieved: 2010-08-05]&lt;/ref&gt; which included animals (the tenth edition became the starting point for zoological nomenclature) was followed by ''[[Critica Botanica]]'' in 1737, and ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]'' in 1751. But it was his most comprehensive work on plants, the 1753 publication ''[[Species Plantarum]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.botanicus.org/title.aspx?bibid=b12069590 Linnaeus' ''Species Plantarum'' Retrieved: 2010-08-05]&lt;/ref&gt; that formalised the name of a genus with a single epithet to form the name of a species as two words, the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] thus making secure the biological system of binomial nomenclature. In these works Linnaeus used a third name as a variety within a species. These varieties included both wild and horticultural variants. The horticultural varieties were still written in Latin and some have persisted to this day.

Linnaeus had very definite and uncomplimentary views about cultigens, regarding them as inferior plants for the amusement of those people he disparagingly called anthophiles (flower-lovers); these were plants not deserving the attention of serious botanists. His views revealed both his prejudice, his stance on special creation, and his recognition of the difficulties entailed in cultivated plant taxonomy:

{{cquote|"''anthophiles … practice a floral science all their own, grasped only by their devotees;  no botanist in his senses will enlist in their camp.''"&lt;ref&gt;Aphorism 310 , ''Philosophia Botanica''&lt;/ref&gt;

"''All the species recognized by Botanists came forth from the Almighty Creator's hand, and the number now and always will be exactly the same, while every day new and different florist's species arise from the true species recognized by botanists, and when they have arisen they eventually revert to their original forms. Accordingly to the former have been assigned by Nature fixed limits, beyond which they cannot go: while the latter display without end the infinite sport of Nature.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hort|1938|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"... ''botany has been overborne by the system of varieties for long enough … few, if any, agree as to what constitutes a species, or what a variety; … I wish the system of varieties were entirely excluded from Botany and turned over entirely to the Anthophiles, since it causes nothing but ambiguities, errors, dead weight and vanity'' …"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Heller Eng.transl. Preface to Hortus Cliffortianus|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===1800 to 1900 – global plant trade===
[[File:Species plantarum 001.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Linnaeus's ''Species Plantarum'' of 1753, his catalogue of all the world's plants known to European science.]]
The natural distribution of plants across the world has determined when and where cultigens have been produced. The botanical and horticultural collection of economically important plants, including  ornamentals, was based in Europe. Although economic herbs and [[Spice trade|spices]] had a long history in trade, and there are good records of cultivar distribution by the Romans, European botanical and horticultural exploration rapidly increased in the 19th century with the colonial expansion taking place at the time. New plants were brought back to Europe while, at the same time, valuable economic plants, including those from the tropics, were distributed among the colonies. This plant trade has provided the common global heritage of economic and ornamental cultigens that we use today and which formed the stock for modern plant selection, breeding, and genetic engineering.
The plant exchange that occurred as a result of European trade can be divided into several phases:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1965|pp=325–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:::* to 1560 mostly within Europe
:::* 1560–1620 Near East (esp. bulbous plants from Turkey – "tulipomania")

===1900 to 1950 – the Botanical Code and cultigen nomenclature===
{{Main article|Cultigen}}
As the community of people dealing with the cultigens of commerce grew so, once again, the divergence between taxonomy serving scientific purposes and utilitarian taxonomy meeting human needs re-emerged. In 1865 German botanist [[Karl Koch (botanist)|Karl Koch]], who became General Secretary of the Berlin Horticultural Society, expressed resentment at the continued use of Latin for cultigen names. Many proposals to deal with this were made, perhaps the most prominent being the ''Lois de la nomenclature botanique'' submitted in 1867 to the fourth Horticultural and Botanical Congress by Swiss botanist [[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle|Alphonse de Candolle]] who, in Article 40 stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Seedlings, half-breeds (métis) of unknown origin or sports should receive from horticulturists fancy names (noms de fantaisie) in common language, as distinct as possible from the Latin names of species or varieties''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|deCandolle|1867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
[[File:Liberty Hyde Bailey 1858-1954.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Outstanding American cultivated plant taxonomist [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] (1858–1954).]]
This Article, making provision for the cultigens of horticultural nomenclature was to remain in the ''Botanical Code'' (with a minor amendment in 1935 suggesting the use of the letter 'c' before the horticultural name and antedating formal recognition of the cultivar) through 1906, 1912 and 1935 until the separation, in 1953, of the ''Horticultural Code'', precursor to the ''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'' (''Cultivated Plant Code''). In 1900 there was the first [[International Botanical Congress]] and in 1905 at the second Congress in Vienna an agreed set of nomenclatural rules was established, the ''Vienna Rules'', which became known from then on as the ''International Code of Botanical Nomenclature'' (now the ''International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants''). After World War II the responsibility for the ''Botanical Code'' was taken up by the [[International Association for Plant Taxonomy]] and meetings to discuss revisions are held at six-yearly intervals, the latest being in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In horticulture at this time there existed all the problems that had confronted botanists in the 19th century – a plethora of names of various length, written and published in many languages with much duplication. The period between 1867 and 1953 was an uneasy time in which American horticulturists and other groups in Europe, such as the specialist orchid community, made attempts to put order into this chaos within their particular group of interest and devising their own rules for naming the plants of commerce. 
[[Friedrich Alefeld]] (1820–1872), who used Latin variety names, in a monographic study of beans, lentils and other [[legume]]s distinguished three [[subspecies|infraspecific]] taxonomic categories: ''Unterart'' (subspecies), ''Varietäten Gruppe'' and ''Kultur-Varietät'', all with Latin names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stearn|1986|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this he was probably laying the ground for the later establishment of the cultigen classification categories cultivar and Group. In conjunction with the Brussels International Botanical Congress of 1910 there was an International Horticultural Congress having a horticultural nomenclature component.

As a result of general dissatisfaction and a submission from the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] the ''Règles de Nomenclature Horticole'' was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Royal Horticultural Society|1911}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of simple descriptive Latin names (e.g. ''compactus'', ''nanus'', ''prostratus'') for horticultural variants was accepted and so too were names in the local language – which were not to be translated and should preferably consist of one word and a maximum of three. This first ''Horticultural Code'' consisted of 16 Articles. With the intercession of a World War I it was not until the ''9th Horticultural Congress'' in London in 1930 that the rules of a Horticulture Nomenclature Committee were agreed and added as an appendix to the 1935 ''Botanical Code''. The rules established in 1935 were accepted but needed to be extended to include the cultigens of agriculture and forestry, but it was only a result of discussions at the 1950 International Botanical Congress in Stockholm and the 18th International Horticultural Congress in London in 1952 the first ''International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants'' was published in 1953. The American horticultural botanist [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]] was responsible for coining the word cultigen in 1918&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bailey|1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Spencer|Cross|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and cultivar in 1923,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bailey|1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word cultivar only coming into general circulation with the new Code of 1953. The use of these two terms belies the  multitude of classification terms and categories that had been suggested as designations for cultigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jirásek|1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jeffrey|1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1953 – the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants===
{{Main article|International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants}}
The first ''Cultivated Plant Code'' (Wageningen), which was published in 1953, has been followed by eight subsequent editions – in 1958 (Utrecht), 1961 (update of 1958), 1969 (Edinburgh), 1980 (Seattle), 1995 (Edinburgh),  2004 (Toronto) and 2009 (Wageningen).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brickell|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the structure of the ''Botanical Code'' the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' is set out in the form of an initial set of Principles followed by Rules and Recommendations that are subdivided into Articles. Amendments to the ''Cultivated Plant Code'' are prompted by international symposia for cultivated plant taxonomy which allow for rulings made by the ''International Commission on the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants''. Each new ''Cultivated Plant Code'' includes a summary of the changes made to the previous version and these have also been summarised for the period 1953 to 1995.&lt;ref name="Trehane 2004 17–27"/&gt;

==International Association for Cultivated Plant Taxonomy==
[[File:Wisley Gardens laboratory 8 6 7-90.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[RHS Garden, Wisley|Wisley]] is one of the [[Royal Horticultural Society|Royal Horticultural Society's]] flagship gardens and a focus for cultivated plant taxonomy.]]
Recent concerns have focused on international communication on cultivated plant taxonomy, organisation of international symposia, and general communication on topics of interest. In 1988 a ''Horticultural Taxonomy Group'' (''Hortax'')&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;[http://www.hortax.org.uk A committee of cultivated plant taxonomists based in the British Isles.] Retrieved: 2010-08-05&lt;/ref&gt; was formed in the UK and a parallel organisation, the ''Nomenclature and Registration Working Group'' of the ''Vaste Keurings Commissie'' in the Netherlands. One development promoting discussion was the newsletter ''Hortax News'' which was superseded in February 2006 by the first issue of ''Hanburyana'', a journal produced by the Royal Horticultural Society in London and dedicated to horticultural taxonomy. This filled a gap left when the American journal ''Baileya'' ceased publication in the early 1990s. Another development was the launch, in 2007, at the Sixth Symposium on the Taxonomy of Cultivated Plants at Wageningen of the International Association for Cultivated Plant Taxonomy. ''Hortax'' also publishes ''Plant Names: A Guide for Horticulturists, Nurserymen, Gardeners and Students''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hortax.org.uk/uploads/4/1/3/5/4135326/hortax_plantnames.pdf ''Plant Names: A Guide for Horticulturists, Nurserymen, Gardeners and Students''. Hortax 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927205640/http://www.hortax.org.uk/uploads/4/1/3/5/4135326/hortax_plantnames.pdf |date=2013-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presenting cultigen names==
Most cultigens have names consisting of a Latin name that is governed by the ''International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants'' e.g. ''[[Malus domestica]]'', to which is added a cultigen epithet, enclosed in single quotes e.g. ''Malus domestica'' 'Granny Smith'. The formation and use of the three classification categories (ranks) used for cultigens, the cultivar, Group and grex, is regulated by the ICNCP. Examples of acceptable ways to present cultigen names are given below:

:::''Prunus serrata'' Sato-zakura Group
:::''Prunus serrata'' (Sato-zakura Group) 'Ojochin'
:::''Prunus'' 'Ojochin'
:::Flowering cherry 'Ojochin'

==Contemporary issues==
[[File:Chelsea physic garden.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chelsea Physic Garden, summer 2006]]
Current challenges for cultivated plant taxonomists include: the use of large plant name databases; ways of dealing with the use of non-scientific names in commerce (known as [[Cultivar#Trade designations and "selling names"|trade designations]]), especially for plant labels in nurseries; intellectual property and plants; adapting modern technology, in particular molecular techniques, to the creation and identification of cultivars; maintaining [[germplasm]] collections of cultivars, including herbaria; the recording and registration of cultivars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Andrews|Leslie|Alexander|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ways in which the plant variation resulting from human activity is named and classified remains contentious. The replacement of the expression "cultivated plant" with the word "cultigen" is not universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Cultivated Plant Code, see footnote {{Harvnb|Brickell|2009|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate continues concerning the notions of ranks and taxa as applied to cultigens. Is it appropriate to call the highly modified [[transgene|transgenic products]] of human artificial selection "taxa"  in the same way we do for the products of natural selection in the wild? To overcome this difficulty the term ''culton'' (pl. ''culta'') has been suggested to replace the word taxon when speaking about cultigens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hetterscheid|Brandenburg|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hetterscheid|Brandenburg|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|1998|pp=15–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, most "wild" plants fit neatly into the nested hierarchy of ranks used in Linnaean classification (species into genera, genera into families etc.) which aligns with Darwinian descent with modification. Choosing classification categories for cultigens is not clear-cut. Included among cultigens are: simple selections taken  from plants in the wild or in cultivation; artificial hybrids produced both by accident and  intention; plants produced by [[genetic engineering]]; [[cloning|clonal material]] reproduced by cuttings, [[grafting]], [[budding]], [[layering]] etc.; [[graft-chimaera]]s; selections from the wild; ancient selections of crops that date back thousands of years; selections of aberrant growth such as [[witches broom]]s; the results of deliberate repeatable single crosses between two pure lines to produce plants of a particular general appearance that is desirable for horticulture, but which are not genetically identical. The question remains as to whether the classification categories of cultivar, Group and grex are the most appropriate and efficient way to deal with this broad range of plant variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philology]], '''decipherment''' is the discovery of the meaning of texts written in ancient or obscure languages or scripts.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, R.L (2000). ''The Dictionary of Historical and Comparative Linguistics''. Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, p. 82 ("The process of determining the relation between an extinct and unknown writing system and the language it represents. Strictly, decipherment is the elucidation of the ''script''—that is, determining the values of the written characters")&lt;/ref&gt;  Decipherment in [[cryptography]] refers to [[decryption]].&lt;ref&gt;Vaudenay, Serge (2006). ''A Classical Introduction to Cryptography''. Springer, p.3. ("Action to transform a ciphertext into a plaintext by an ''authorized party'' [emphasis added]")&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used sardonically in everyday language to describe attempts to read poor handwriting.&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decipherment&lt;/ref&gt; In [[genetics]], decipherment is the successful attempt to understand [[DNA]], which is viewed metaphorically as a text containing word-like units.&lt;ref&gt;Snustad, D. Peter, et al. (2016). ''Principles of Genetics''. Wiley, p.302&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout science the term decipherment is synonymous with the understanding of biological and chemical phenomena.

==Ancient languages==
In a few cases, a multilingual artifact has been necessary to facilitate decipherment, the [[Rosetta Stone]] being the classic example. Statistical techniques provide another pathway to decipherment, as does the analysis of modern languages derived from ancient languages in which undeciphered texts are written. Archaeological and historical information is helpful in verifying hypothesized decipherments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6953">'''Descriptive research''' is used to describe characteristics of a  [[statistical population|population]] or phenomenon being studied.   It does not answer questions about how/when/why  the characteristics occurred.  Rather it addresses the "what" question (what are the characteristics of the population or situation being studied?)&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields|Shields, Patricia]] and Rangarajan, N. 2013. A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. See Chapter 4 for an in-depth discussion of descriptive research&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics used to describe the situation or population are usually some kind of categorical scheme also known as descriptive categories. For example, the [[periodic table]] categorizes the elements. Scientists use knowledge about the nature of electrons, protons and neutrons to devise this categorical scheme. We now take for granted the [[periodic table]], yet it took descriptive research to devise it.  Descriptive research generally precedes explanatory research. For example, over time  the periodic table’s description of the elements allowed scientists to explain chemical reaction and make sound prediction when elements were combined.
Hence, descriptive research cannot describe what caused a situation.  Thus, descriptive research cannot be used as the basis of a ''[[Causality|causal relationship]]'', where one variable affects another. In other words, descriptive research can be said to have a low requirement for [[internal validity]].

The description is used for [[frequency (disambiguation)|frequencies]], [[average]]s and other statistical calculations.  Often the best approach, prior to writing descriptive research, is to conduct a survey investigation. [[Qualitative research]] often has the aim of ''description'' and researchers may follow-up with examinations of why the observations exist and what the implications of the findings are.

==Social science research==
In addition, the conceptualizing of descriptive research (categorization or taxonomy) precedes the hypotheses of explanatory research.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia and HassanTajalli. 2006. Intermediate Theory: The Missing Link in Successful Student Scholarship. Journal of Public Affairs Education. Vol. 12, No. 3. Pp. 313-334. http://ecommons.txstate.edu/polsfacp/39/&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of how the underlying conceptualization of [[Exploratory research]], Descriptive research and explanatory research fit together see [[Conceptual framework]].
Descriptive research is also known as Statistical Research. The main goal of this type of research is to describe the data and characteristics about what is being studied. The idea behind this type of research is to study frequencies, averages, and other statistical calculations. Although this research is highly accurate, it does not gather the causes behind a situation. Descriptive research is mainly done when a researcher wants to gain a better understanding of a topic. That is, analysis of the past as opposed to the future. Descriptive research is the exploration of the existing certain phenomena. The details of the facts won't be known. The existing phenomena’s facts are not known to the person.

==Descriptive science==
Descriptive science is a category of [[science]] that involves descriptive research; that is, observing, recording, describing, and classifying [[phenomena]].  Descriptive research is sometimes contrasted with [[Hypothesis testing|hypothesis-driven research]], which is focused on testing a particular [[hypothesis]] by means of [[experimentation]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite journal

[[David Grimaldi (entomologist)|David A. Grimaldi]] and [[Michael S. Engel]] suggest that descriptive science in biology is currently undervalued and misunderstood:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Descriptive" in science is a pejorative, almost always preceded by "merely," and typically applied to the array of classical -ologies and -omies: anatomy, archaeology, astronomy, embryology, morphology, paleontology, taxonomy, botany, cartography, stratigraphy, and the various disciplines of zoology, to name a few. [...] First, an organism, object, or substance is not described in a vacuum, but rather in comparison with other organisms, objects, and substances. [...] Second, descriptive science is not necessarily low-tech science, and high tech is not necessarily better. [...] Finally, a theory is only as good as what it explains and the evidence (i.e., descriptions) that supports it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioone.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1641%2FB570802 BioScience Volume 57, Issue 8 (September 2007)] article ''Why Descriptive Science Still Matters'' by D.A. Grimaldi &amp; M.S. Engel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A negative attitude by scientists toward descriptive science is not limited to biological disciplines: [[Ernest Rutherford|Lord Rutherford's]] [[Ernest rutherford#Famous statements|notorious quote]], "All science is either physics or stamp collecting," displays a clear negative attitude about descriptive science, and it is known that he was dismissive of [[astronomy]], which at the beginning of the 20th century was still gathering largely descriptive data about stars, nebulae, and galaxies, and was only beginning to develop a satisfactory integration of these observations within the framework of [[physical law]], a cornerstone of the [[philosophy of physics]].{{According to whom|date=November 2014}}

==Descriptive versus design sciences==
[[Ilkka Niiniluoto]] has used the terms "descriptive sciences" and "design sciences" as an updated version of the distinction between [[Basic research|basic]] and [[applied science]].  According to Niiniluoto, descriptive sciences are those that seek to describe reality, while design sciences seek useful knowledge for human activities.&lt;ref name=phil&gt;[http://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/praatika/Valuefreedom%20of%20science.DOC Heikki J.

'''DeviceKit''' is a modular [[hardware abstraction layer]] designed for use in [[Linux]] systems that is designed to simplify device management and replace the current [[Monolithic kernel|monolithic]] Linux [[HAL (software)|HAL]]. DeviceKit includes the ability to enumerate system devices and send notifications when hardware is added or removed from the computer system.

In May 2008, HAL developer David Zeuthen announced his intention to deprecate HAL, mainly because of its complexity and redundancy with other libraries in the Linux environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/hal/2008-May/011560.html
| title=Update on DeviceKit
| author=David Zeuthen
| date=2008-05-07
| accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only missing part in those libraries would be a centralized service to enumerate existing devices, signal adding/removal of devices and merging and classifying available hardware information in one point. DeviceKit is the new library providing those services, while the hardware is supposed to be accessed through other libraries instead of HAL or DeviceKit.

The first distribution to include DeviceKit was [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title=TechnicalOverview: hal deprecation
| website=ubuntu.com
| date=2009-10-28
| accessdate=2017-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2009, it was announced that DeviceKit-disks was renamed to udisks and that a similar rename would happen for DeviceKit-power.&lt;ref name="udisks"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/devkit-devel/2009-December/000567.html

== Future ==
According to DeviceKit devel mailing list, DeviceKit is getting merged with &lt;tt&gt;udev-extra&lt;/tt&gt; and the existing DeviceKit programs such as [[DeviceKit-disks]] and [[DeviceKit-power]] will be switched over to use &lt;tt&gt;libudev&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref name="udisks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25091">An '''ecological network''' is a representation of the [[biological interaction|biotic interactions]] in an [[ecosystem]], in which species (nodes) are connected by pairwise interactions (links).  These interactions can be [[trophic web|trophic]] or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]].  Ecological networks are used to describe and compare the structures of real ecosystems, while network models are used to investigate the effects of network structure on properties such as [[ecosystem stability]].

== Properties ==
Historically, research into ecological networks developed from descriptions of trophic relationships in aquatic [[food web]]s; however, recent work has expanded to look at other food webs as well as webs of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]]s. Results of this work have identified several important properties of ecological networks.

'''[[Complexity]]''' ([linkage density): the average number of links per species.  Explaining the observed high levels of complexity in ecosystems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Berlow | first2 = E.L. | last3 = Dunne | first3 = J.A. | last4 = Barabasi | first4 = A.L. | last5 = Martinez | first5 = N.D. | year = 2002 | title = Two degrees of separation in complex food webs | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 12913–12916 | doi=10.1073/pnas.192448799| pmc = 130559 | bibcode = 2002PNAS...9912913W }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been one of the main challenges and motivations for ecological network analysis, since early theory predicted that complexity should lead to instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimm | first1 = S.L. | year = 1984 | title = The complexity and stability of ecosystems | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 307 | issue = | pages = 321–326 | doi=10.1038/307321a0| bibcode = 1984Natur.307..321P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Connectivity (graph theory)|Connectance]]''': the proportion of possible links between species that are realized (links/species&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  In food webs, the level of connectance is related to the statistical distribution of the links per species.  The distribution of links changes from (partial) [[power-law]] to exponential to [[Discrete uniform distribution|uniform]] as the level of connectance increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunne | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Williams | first2 = R.J. | last3 = Martinez | first3 = N.D. | year = 2002 | title = Food-web structure and network theory: The role of connectance and size | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 12917–12922 | doi=10.1073/pnas.192407699 | pmid=12235364 | pmc=130560| bibcode = 2002PNAS...9912917D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The observed values of connectance in empirical food webs appear to be accountable for by constraints on an organisms diet breadth driven by [[optimal foraging]] behaviour.This links the structure of these ecological networks to the behaviour of individual organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beckerman | first1 = A.P. | last2 = Petchey | first2 = O.L. | last3 = Warren | first3 = P.H. | year = 2006 | title = Foraging biology predicts food web complexity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 103 | issue = | pages = 13745–13749 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0603039103 | pmid=16954193 | pmc=1560085| bibcode = 2006PNAS..10313745B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Degree distribution]]''': the degree distribution of an ecological network is the cumulative distribution for the number of links each species has. The degree distributions of food webs have been found to display the same universal functional form. The degree distribution can be split into its two component parts, links to a species' prey (aka. in degree) and links to a species' predators (aka- out degree). Both the in degree and out degree distributions display their own universal functional forms. As there is a faster decay of the out-degree distribution than the in degree distribution we can expect that on average in a food web a species will have more in links than out links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stouffer | first1 = D.B. | year = 2010 | title = Scaling from individuals to networks in food webs | url = | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 44–51 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01644.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Clustering coefficient|Clustering]]''': the proportion of species that are directly linked to a focal species.  A focal species in the middle of a cluster may be a [[keystone species]], and its loss could have large effects on the network.

'''Compartmentalization''': the division of the network into relatively independent sub-networks.  Some ecological networks have been observed to be compartmentalized by body size&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmid-Araya | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Schmid | first2 = P.E. | last3 = Robertson | first3 = A. | last4 = Winterbottom | first4 = J. | last5 = Gjerlov | first5 = C. | last6 = Hildrew | first6 = A.G. | year = 2002 | title = Connectance in stream food webs | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 1056–1062 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2656.2002.00668.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reuman | first1 = D.C. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = J.E. | year = 2004 | title = Trophic links' length and slope in the Tuesday Lake food web with species' body mass and numerical abundance | url = | journal = Journal of Animal Ecology | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 852–866 | doi=10.1111/j.0021-8790.2004.00856.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by spatial location.&lt;ref name="krause03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krause | first1 = A.E. | last2 = Frank | first2 = K.A. | last3 = Mason | first3 = D.M. | last4 = Ulanowicz | first4 = R.E. | last5 = Taylor | first5 = W.W. | year = 2003 | title = Compartments revealed in food-web structure | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 426 | issue = | pages = 282–285 | doi=10.1038/nature02115 | pmid=14628050| bibcode = 2003Natur.426..282K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence also exists which suggests that compartmentilization in food webs appears to result from patterns of species' diet contiguity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guimera | first1 = R. | last2 = Stouffer | first2 = D.B. | last3 = Sales-Pardo | first3 = M. | last4 = Leicht | first4 = E.A. | last5 = Newman | first5 = M.E.J. | last6 = Ameral | first6 = L.A.N. | year = 2010 | title = Origin of compartmentalization in food webs | url = | journal = Ecology | volume = 91 | issue = | pages = 2941–2951 | doi=10.1890/09-1175.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adaptive foraging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nuwagaba | first1 = S. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = F. | last3 = Hui | first3 = C. | year = 2015 | title = A hybrid behavioural rule of adaptation and drift explains the emergent architecture of antagonistic networks | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 282 | issue = 1807 | pages = 20150320 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2015.0320 | pmid=25925104 | pmc=4424652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Nestedness]]''': the degree to which species with few links have a sub-set of the links of other species, rather than a different set of links.  In highly nested networks, [[guild (ecology)|guilds]] of species that share an [[ecological niche]] contain both generalists (species with many links) and specialists (species with few links, all shared with the generalists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Domínguez-García V, Muñoz MA |year=2013 |title=Factors Determining Nestedness in Complex Networks |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |pages=e74025 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0074025|bibcode=2013PLoSO...874025J }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In mutualistic networks, nestedness is often asymmetrical, with specialists of one guild linked to the generalists of the partner guild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bascompte | first1 = J. | last2 = Jordano | first2 = P. | last3 = Melian | first3 = C.J. | last4 = Olesen | first4 = J.M. | year = 2003 | title = The nested assembly of plant-animal mutualistic networks | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 9383–9387 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1633576100 | pmid=12881488 | pmc=170927| bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.9383B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of nestedness is determined not by species features but overall network depictors (e.g. network size and connectance) and can be predicted by a dynamic adaptive model with species rewiring to maximize individual fitness&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = F. | last2 = Hui | first2 = C. | last3 = Terblanche | first3 = J.S. | year = 2011 | title = An interaction switch predicts the nested architecture of mutualistic networks | url = | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 797–803 | doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01647.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the fitness of the whole community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Suweis | first1 = S. | last2 = Simini | first2 = F. | last3 = Banavar | first3 = J | last4 = Maritan | first4 = A. | year = 2013 | title = Emergence of structural and dynamical properties of ecological mutualistic networks | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 500 | issue = | pages = 449–452 | doi=10.1038/nature12438 | pmid=23969462| arxiv = 1308.4807 | bibcode = 2013Natur.500..449S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Network motif]]''': Motifs are unique sub-graphs composed of n-nodes found embedded in a network. For instance there exist thirteen unique motif structures containing three species, some of these correspond to familiar interaction modules studied by population ecologists such as [[food chains]], [[apparent competition]], or [[intraguild predation]]. Studies investigating motif structures of ecological networks, by examining patterns of under/over representation of certain motifs compared to a random graph, have found that food webs have particular motif structures &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stouffer | first1 = D.B. | last2 = Sales-Pardo | first2 = Camacho | last3 = Jiang | first3 = W. | last4 = Ameral | first4 = L.A.N. | year = 2007 | title = Evidence for the existence of a robust pattern of prey selection in food webs | url = | journal = Proc. R. Soc. B | volume = 274 | issue = | pages = 1931–1940 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.0571| pmc = 2275185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Trophic coherence]]''': The tendency of species to specialise on particular trophic levels leads to food webs displaying a significant degree of order in their trophic structure, known as ''trophic coherence'',&lt;ref name="johnson2014"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnson S, Domı́nguez-Garcı́a V, Donetti L, Muñoz MA |year=2014 |title=Trophic coherence determines food-web stability |journal=[[Proc Natl Acad Sci USA]] |volume=111 |pages=17923–17928 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1409077111|arxiv=1404.7728 |bibcode=2014PNAS..11117923J }}&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn has important effects on properties such as [[Ecological stability|stability]] and prevalence of [[Cycle (graph theory)|cycles]].&lt;ref name="johnson2017"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Johnson S and Jones NS |year=2017 |title=Looplessness in networks is linked to trophic coherence |journal=[[Proc Natl Acad Sci USA]] |volume=114 |pages=5618–5623 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1613786114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stability ==
The relationship between ecosystem complexity and stability is a major topic of interest in [[ecology]].  Use of ecological networks makes it possible to analyze the effects of the network properties described above on the stability of an ecosystem.  Ecosystem complexity was once thought to reduce stability by enabling the effects of disturbances, such as species loss or species invasion, to spread and amplify through the network.  However, other characteristics of network structure have been identified that reduce the spread of indirect effects and thus enhance ecosystem stability.&lt;ref&gt;Suweis, S., Grilli, J., Banavar, J. R., Allesina, S., &amp; Maritan, A. (2015) Effect of localization on the stability of mutualistic ecological networks. "Nature Communications", 6&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between complexity and stability can even be inverted in food webs with sufficient trophic coherence, so that increases in biodiversity would make a community more stable rather than less.&lt;ref name="johnson2014"/&gt;

Interaction strength may decrease with the number of links between species, damping the effects of any disturbance&lt;ref&gt;Diego P. Vázquez, Carlos J. Melián, Neal M. Williams, Nico Blüthgen, Boris R. Krasnov and [[Robert Poulin (zoologist)|Robert Poulin]]. (2007) Species abundance and asymmetric interaction strength in ecological networks.

The nested structure of mutualisitic networks was shown to promote the capacity of species to persist under increasingly harsh circumstances. Most likely, because the nested structure of mutualistic networks helps species to indirectly support each other when circumstances are harsh. This indirect facilitation helps species to survive, but it also means that under harsh circumstances one species cannot survive without the support of the other. As circumstances become increasingly harsh, a tipping point may therefore be passed at which the populations of a large number of species may collapse simultaneously.&lt;ref name=Lever_et_al&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lever | first1 = J.

== Other applications ==
Additional applications of ecological networks include exploration of how the community context affects pairwise interactions.  The community of species in an ecosystem is expected to affect both the ecological interaction and [[coevolution]] of pairs of species.  Related, spatial applications are being developed for studying [[metapopulation]]s, [[epidemiology]], and the [[co-operation (evolution)|evolution of cooperation]].  In these cases, networks of habitat patches (metapopulations) or individuals (epidemiology, social behavior), make it possible to explore the effects of spatial heterogeneity.

'''Ellen Henrietta Swallow Richards''' (December 3, 1842 &amp;ndash; March 30, 1911) was an [[Industrial engineering|industrial]] and [[Safety engineering|safety engineer]], [[environmental chemist]], and university faculty member in the United States during the 19th century. Her pioneering work in sanitary engineering, and experimental research in domestic science, laid a foundation for the new science of [[home economics]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2135&amp;ResourceType=Building |title=Richards, Ellen Swallow, Residence |date=April 7, 1991 |accessdate=2013-09-04 |quote= |publisher=[[National Historic Landmarks Program]] |location= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011063112/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=2135&amp;ResourceType=Building |archivedate=October 11, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the founder of the home economics movement characterized by the application of science to the home, and the first to apply chemistry to the study of nutrition.&lt;ref name=mozans&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozans|first1=H.

== Biography ==

=== Early childhood ===
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards 1848.jpg|thumb|upright|Daguerreotype of Ellen Henrietta Swallow, c. 1848]]
Richards was born in [[Dunstable, Massachusetts]]. She was the only child of Peter Swallow (b. June 27, 1813, Dunstable; d. March 1871, Littleton, Massachusetts) and Fanny Gould Taylor (b. April 9, 1817, [[New Ipswich, New Hampshire]]), both of whom came from established families of modest means and were believers in the value of education.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

=== Early life and education ===
Swallow was home-schooled in her early years. In 1859 the family moved to Westford and she attended [[Westford Academy]].&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hunt | first = Caroline Louisa | title = The life of Ellen H. Richards | publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1912 | isbn = | url = https://archive.org/details/lifeofellenhrich00huntrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies at the academy included mathematics, composition, and Latin, similar to other New England academies of the time.  Swallow's Latin proficiency allowed her to study French and German, a rare language north of New York.&lt;ref name="JuneKennedy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kennedy | first = June W. | title = Westford Recollections of Days Gone By: Recorded Interviews 1974-1975 A Millennium Update | publisher = Author House | edition = 1st | location = Bloomington, IN | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-4259-2388-7 | lccn = 2006904814 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her language skills she was much in demand as a tutor, and the income earned doing this made it possible for Swallow to further her studies.

[[File:Old Westford Academy, MA.jpg|thumb|Old Westford Academy]]

In March 1862, she left the academy. Two months later, in May, she developed the [[measles]] which set her back physically and interrupted her preparations to begin teaching.

[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards.jpg|thumb|upright|Miss Ellen Henrietta Swallow, c. 1864]]
In the spring of 1863 the family moved to Littleton, Massachusetts, where Mr. Swallow had just purchased a larger store and expanded his business. In June 1864, Swallow, now twenty-one, took a teaching position.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

She did not teach again in 1865 but spent that year tending the family store and taking care of her ill mother. During the winter of 1865–66, Swallow studied and attended lectures in Worcester.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== College education ===
In September 1868 she entered [[Vassar College]] classified as a special student.  Somewhat over a year later she was admitted to the senior class, graduating in 1870 with a bachelor's degree.  She then earned a Master of Art's degree with a thesis on the chemical analysis of iron ore. The strongest personal influences during her college years were [[Maria Mitchell]], the astronomer, and Professor Charles S. Farrar (1826-1908&lt;ref name="FarrarVassar"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/faculty/original-faculty/charles-farrar.html |title= Charles Farrar |author= Vassar Historian |date= |website= Vassar Encyclopedia|publisher= |accessdate=26 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who was at the head of the Department of Natural Sciences and Mathematics.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

In 1870, she wrote to Merrick and Gray, commercial chemists in Boston, asking if they would take her on as an apprentice.  They replied that they were not in a position to take pupils, and that her best course was to try to enter the Institute of Technology of Boston as a student.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;
On December 10, 1870, after some discussion and a vote, the Faculty of the Institute of Technology recommend to the Corporation the admission of Miss Swallow as a special student in Chemistry.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt; Swallow thus became the first woman admitted to [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where she was able to continue her studies, "it being understood that her admission did not establish a precedent for the general admission of females" according to the records of the meeting of the [[MIT Corporation]] on December 14, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-mit.html#corp Ellen Swallow Richards &amp; MIT: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1873, Swallow received a Bachelor of Science degree from MIT for her thesis, "Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado".&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-swallow.pdf Notes on Some Sulpharsenites and Sulphantimonites from Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt; She continued her studies at MIT and would have been awarded its first advanced degree, but MIT balked at granting this distinction to a woman and did not award its first advanced degree, a Master of Science in Chemistry, until 1886.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Richards served on the board of trustees of Vassar College for many years and was granted an honorary doctor of science degree in 1910.

=== Marriage and home ===
[[File:Ellen Swallow Richards 1904.jpg|upright|thumb|Robert and Ellen Richards, 1904]]
On June 4, 1875, Miss Swallow married [[Robert Hallowell Richards|Robert H. Richards]] (1844-1945), chairman of the [[Mine Engineering]] Department at MIT, with whom she had worked in the mineralogy laboratory.  They took up residence in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. With her husband's support she remained associated with MIT, volunteering her services and contributing $1,000 annually to the "Woman's Laboratory," a program in which her students were mostly schoolteachers, whose training had lacked laboratory work, and who wanted to perform chemical experiments and learn mineralogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossiter|first1=Margaret W.|title=Women Scientists in America|date=1982|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0801824435|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Her first post-college career was as an unpaid chemistry lecturer at MIT from 1873 to 1878.&lt;ref name=zierdt /&gt;

[[File:Lawrence Experiment Station - DSC03522.JPG|thumb|right|2011 addition to the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]]]]
From 1884 until her death, Swallow now Richards was an instructor at the newly founded laboratory of sanitary chemistry at the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]], the first in the United States, headed by her former professor [[William R. Nichols]].

In 1884 she was appointed as an instructor in sanitary chemistry at a newly formed MIT laboratory for the study of sanitation.&lt;ref name=ogilvie&gt;{{Cite book

Mrs. Richards was a consulting chemist for the Massachusetts State Board of Health from 1872 to 1875, and the Commonwealth's official water analyst from 1887 until 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/women-scientists/ellen-h-swallow-richards.html|title=Ellen H.

== Scientific experiments ==

=== Air and water quality ===

In the 1880s, her interests turned toward issues of sanitation, in particular air and water quality.&lt;ref name=zierdt /&gt; She performed a series of water tests on 40,000 samples of local waters which served as drinking water for their immediate populations.  These led to the so-called "Richards' Normal Chlorine Map" which was predictive of inland water pollution in the state of Massachusetts. This map plotted the chloride concentrations in waters of the state. It illustrated the natural distribution of chlorides from the ocean. (Her survey long preceded the practice of road de-icing with chlorine derivative salts.) Her map plotted greater than 6.5 parts per million (ppm) of chloride near the coast, with Cape Cod concentrations well in excess of 10 ppm and with a near-steady decreasing gradient to less than 1 ppm about the Berkshire Hills in the extreme western end of the state. Thereby waters with chloride concentrations that deviated from the plot could be suspected of human pollution. As a result, Massachusetts established the first water-quality standards in America, and the first modern [[sewage treatment plant]] was created.&lt;ref name=oakes /&gt;

=== Mineralogy ===
Richards' master's thesis at Vassar was an analysis of the amount of [[vanadium]] in iron ore.&lt;ref name=oakes&gt;{{Cite book

        }}&lt;/ref&gt;
She performed numerous experiments in mineralogy, including the discovery of an insoluble residue of the rare mineral [[Samarskite-(Y)|samarskite]]. This was later determined by other scientists to yield [[samarium]] and [[gadolinium]]. In 1879 she was recognized by the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers as their first female member.&lt;ref name=zierdt&gt;{{Cite book

        }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Home sanitation ===
Richards applied her scientific knowledge to the home. Since women were responsible for the home and family nutrition at the time, Richards felt that all women should be educated in the sciences. She wrote books about science for use in the home, such as ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning'', published in 1882.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;{{Cite book

        }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book ''Food Materials and Their Adulterations''(1885) led to the passing of the first Pure Food and Drug Act in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=oakes /&gt;

She used her own home as a kind of experimental laboratory for healthier living through science. Concerned with air quality in her home, she moved from coal heating and cooking oil to gas. She and her husband installed fans to pull air from the home to the outside to create a cleaner air environment within the home. She also determined the water quality of the property's well through chemical testing, and to insure that waste water was not contaminating the drinking water.&lt;ref name=clarke /&gt;

=== Euthenics ===

Richards derived the term [[euthenics]] from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb Eutheneo, Εὐθηνέω (eu, well; the, root of tithemi, to cause). To be in a flourishing state, to abound in, to prosper.—''[[Demosthenes]]''. To be strong or vigorous.—''[[Herodotus]]''. To be vigorous in body.—''[[Aristotle]]''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richards | first = Ellen H. Swallow | title = Euthenics: The Science of Controllable Environment : A Plea for Better Conditions As a First Step Toward Higher Human Efficiency | publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows | edition = 2nd | location = Boston | origyear = 1910 | year = 1912 | isbn = 0405098278 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31508 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  And from the Greek [[Euthenia]], Εὐθηνία. Good state of the body: prosperity, good fortune, abundance.—''Herodotus''.&lt;ref name="EllenSwallowRichards" /&gt; The opposite of Euthenia is [[Penia]] - Πενία ("deficiency" or "[[poverty]]") the personification of poverty and need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Daimon/Penia.html Theoi Project - Penia]&lt;/ref&gt;

In her book ''Euthenics: the science of controllable environment'' (1910),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
    |publisher = Whitcomb &amp; Barrows

    |publication-date = 1910
    }}&lt;/ref&gt; she defined the term as the betterment of living conditions, through conscious endeavor, for the purpose of securing efficient human beings.

Vigorous debate about its exact meaning, confusion with the term [[eugenics]], followed by the [[Great Depression]] and two world wars, were among the many factors which led to the movement never really getting the funding, nor the attention needed to put together a lasting, vastly multidisciplinary curriculum as defined by Richards. Instead, different disciplines such as Child Study became one such curriculum.

Martin Heggestad of the Mann Library notes that:&lt;blockquote&gt; Starting around 1920, however, home economists tended to move into other fields, such as nutrition and textiles, that offered more career opportunities, while health issues were dealt with more in the hard sciences and in the professions of nursing and public health. Also, improvements in public sanitation (for example, the wider availability of sewage systems and of food inspection) led to a decline in infectious diseases and thus a decreasing need for the largely household-based measures taught by home economists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hearth.library.cornell.edu/h/hearth/hygiene.html HEARTH Library-Cornell University]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Richards was the first writer to use the term euthenics, in ''The Cost of Shelter'' (1905), with the meaning "the science of better living".&lt;ref name="JohnKGrandy"&gt;{{cite book | last = Grandy | first = John K. | editor-last = Birx | editor-first = H.J. | title = Euthenics | series = Encyclopedia of Anthropology | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | volume = 5 Vols. | location = Thousand Oaks, CA | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781412952453 | doi = 10.4135/9781412952453 | url =http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/anthropology/n312.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laboratory work ===
After her first experience as water analyst under Professor Nichols, Richards began a large, private practice in sanitary chemistry, including testing water, air and food, and the testing wallpapers and fabrics for [[arsenic]]. In 1878 and 1879 she examined a large number of staple groceries for the state. The results of her investigation were published in the first annual report of the Board of Health, Lunacy and Charity, which had succeeded the earlier Board of Health.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

She also served as a consultant to the [[Zachariah Allen|Manufacturers Mutual Fire Insurance Company]] and in 1900 wrote the textbook ''Air, Water, and Food from a Sanitary Standpoint'', with A. G. Woodman. Her interest in the environment led her to introduce the word [[ecology]] into English around 1892. The word had been coined by German biologist [[Ernst Haeckel]] to describe the "household of nature".

Richards' interests also included applying scientific principles to domestic situations, such as [[nutrition]], [[clothing]], [[physical fitness]], [[sanitation]], and efficient home management, creating the field of [[home economics]]. "Perhaps the fact that I am not a radical and that I do not scorn womanly duties but claim it as a privilege to clean up and sort of supervise the room and sew things is winning me stronger allies than anything else," she wrote to her parents. She published ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning: A Manual for House-keepers'' in 1881, designed and demonstrated model kitchens, devised curricula, and organized conferences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libraries.mit.edu/archives/exhibits/esr/esr-rumford.html Ellen Swallow Richards: Rumford Kitchen: Institute Archives &amp; Special Collections: MIT&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's education ==

=== Woman's Laboratory assistant instructor ===
Mrs. Richards appeared before the [[American Association of University Women|Woman's Education Association]] of Boston on November 11, 1875, and in an address, which made a deep impression, set forth the needs of women. She expressed the belief that the governing board of the Institute of Technology would provide space for a woman's laboratory if the Association would supply the necessary money for instruments, apparatus, and books. She said that scholarships would be indispensable.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

The Woman's Education Association appointed a committee to enter into discussions with the Institute of Technology, which led to the creation of the MIT Woman's Laboratory in November 1876. The Institute provided a small building, planned for a gymnasium, as the location of the Laboratory.  Mrs. Richards became an unpaid assistant instructor in 1879 in [[chemical analysis]], [[industrial chemistry]], [[mineralogy]], and [[biology|applied biology]] under Professor John M. Ordway. The Woman's Education Association agreed to raise money to buy equipment for the laboratory.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

A new building, erected by the Institute in 1883, reserved space for all laboratory students' use, women as well as men. The original Woman's Laboratory was closed and the building demolished.

In 1884, Mrs. Richards was appointed Instructor in Sanitary Chemistry in the Institute of Technology itself, a position which she filled until the time of her death. In addition to her faculty duties and instructional work, she was also the "untitled" Dean of Women.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== American correspondence school instructor ===
In January 1876, Mrs. Richards began a long association with the first American correspondence school, the [[Society to Encourage Studies at Home]], as an instructor, and developed its science department.&lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt;

In 1886, a new section promoted by Richards, Sanitary Science, was established by the Society. This was at a time when household conveniences employing water, gas, or electricity were becoming more common, but housekeepers seldom understood the dangers or difficulties inherent in using these new appliances. She saw that instruction was needed and the Society began to provide information on how to organize a house on truly scientific principles.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== American Association of University Women ===

[[File:AAUW Headquarters by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|upright|Headquarters of the AAUW in Washington DC]]
Richards and [[Marion Talbot]] (Boston University class of 1880) became the "founding mothers" of what was to become the [[American Association of University Women]] (AAUW) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://history.aauw.org/|website=AAUW.org|publisher=AAUW|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they invited fifteen other women college graduates to a meeting at Talbot's home in Boston, on November 28, 1881. The group envisioned an organization in which women college graduates would band together to open the doors of higher education to other women and to find wider opportunities for their training. The Association of Collegiate Alumnae (ACA), AAUW's predecessor organization, was officially founded on January 14, 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of Collegiate Alumnae Records|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss323.html|publisher=Five College Archives &amp; Manuscript Collections|website=five colleges.edu|accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teachers' School of Science ===
[[Lucretia Crocker]], along with women's clubs and other help in the Boston area, created a "[[Teachers' School of Science]]" in Back Bay at the New Museum of the Boston society.  Along with Mrs. Richards, Crocker created a mineralogy course for teachers.  Teacher found such education in the Boston area because of area scientist that would teach their courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kohlstedt, Sally Gregory. |title = Nature, Not Books: Scientists and the Origins of the Nature-Study Movement in the 1890s. Isis, Vol. 96, No. 3 |date = September 2005 |pages=324–352, p. 328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New England Kitchen of Boston ===
In January 1, 1890, Richards collaborated with [[Mary Abel|Mary Hinman Abel]] (1850–1938) to found the New England Kitchen of Boston, at 142 Pleasant Street.  Using volunteers of modest circumstances, they experimented with ways to prepare the most inexpensive, tasty and nutritious food.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Years later, Mrs. Richards, herself, wrote in her preface to part one of ''The Rumford kitchen leaflets: No. 17, The Story of the New England Kitchen; Part II; A study in social economics'', by Mary Abel:&lt;ref name="RumfordKitchen" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The story of the New England Kitchen ... is remarkable for two things: the new and valuable information which has been acquired, as the result of the daily work of the Kitchen, and the short time which has sufficed to put the enterprise on a business basis.

It is well to emphasize the causes of this success, that the lessons in social science and practical philanthropy be not lost. A large part of the credit is due ... to Mrs. Abel's hard work[.] [S]tarting the New England Kitchen ... was ... an experiment to determine the successful conditions of preparing, by scientific methods, from the cheaper food materials, nutritious and palatable dishes, which should find a ready demand at paying prices.

Mrs. Abel would doubtless give as the principal secret of her success, that she had everything necessary for the experiments, without giving a thought to the cost. ... In the New England Kitchen, the selection of the apparatus and material and the employment of labor have been without restriction. Without this freedom to carry on the experiments as seemed wise and prudent, the results detailed in the accompanying report could not have been attained.

The philanthropy of the scheme rests in the experimental stage of the development of the New England Kitchen. Whether the business can in the future take care of itself to the profit of those who conduct it remains to be seen ; but, in any event, kitchens of this kind cannot fail to be of great advantage to multitudes in moderate circumstances, who have hitherto been unable to buy good, nutritious, and tasteful cooked food.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Rumford Kitchen ===
[[File:CountRumfordFrontispiece.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Count Rumford]] frontispiece of the Rumford Kitchen leaflets]]
In 1893, when Richards was in charge of the Rumford Kitchen at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World's Fair in Chicago]], she accepted the added work and responsibility of arranging an exhibition of the work of Studies at Home.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

The opening statement of the ''Guide to the Rumford Kitchen: An Exhibit made by the State of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation'' ([[World's Columbian Exposition]], Chicago, 1893) by General [[Francis Amasa Walker|Francis A. Walker]] explains:&lt;ref name="RumfordKitchen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Richards | first = Ellen H.  | title = Plain words about food: the Rumford kitchen leaflets, 1899. | publisher = Rockwell and Churchill Press | edition = 1st | location = Boston | year = 1899 | isbn = | lccn = | url = http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/2936825?n=1&amp;imagesize=1200&amp;jp2Res=.5&amp;printThumbnails=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The exhibit known as the Rumford Kitchen is the outgrowth of the work, in the application of the principles of chemistry to the science of cooking, which has for three years been carried on as an educational agency by Mrs. Robert H. Richards and Mrs. Dr. John J. Abel, with pecuniary assistance from certain public-spirited citizens of Boston.

The Massachusetts Board of World's Fair Managers, ... believing that such practical demonstration of the usefulness of domestic science could not fail to be of advantage to multitudes of visitors to the Columbian Exposition, have invited the ladies named to open the Rumford Kitchen as a part of the exhibit of Massachusetts in connection with the Bureau of Hygiene and Sanitation.

In order to reduce, in some degree, the expenses of this exhibit, the food cooked in the Rumford Kitchen will be sold under a concession from the administration of the Exposition ; but it should be understood that this is not a money-making exhibit ; that nothing is cooked for the sake of being sold ; and that the enterprise is to be regarded as absolutely a scientific and educational one.

The purpose of the exhibit in the Rumford Kitchen is two-fold : First, to commemorate the services to the cause of domestic science rendered by [[Count Rumford]] one hundred years ago[;] ... second, to serve as an incentive to further work in the same direction, as he expressed it," to provoke men to investigation," "to cause doubt, that first step toward knowledge."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first commercially available "modern" [[Rumford fireplace|kitchen ranges]] began to appear about 1800, they were the invention of an American named Sir Benjamin Thompson, [[Benjamin Thompson|Count von Rumford]].

=== American Public School Lunch Program ===
A first, major program was started in some Boston high schools in 1894 to provide nutritional meals at low prices to children who would not normally have them. Due in large part to Ellen Richards and [[Edward Atkinson (activist)|Edward Atkinson]], the New England Kitchen ran the program as a 'private enterprise' that paid for itself many times over. The lunches never became effective instruments for teaching the New Nutrition the founders had envisaged. But, because the program provided nutritious meals children would otherwise not have, it became the main justification for similar lunch programs in other cities."&lt;ref name="Levenstein"&gt;{{cite book | last = Levenstein | first = Harvey | title = Revolution at the Table: The Transformation of the American Diet | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | edition = | location = New York | year = 1988 | page = 116 | isbn =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed into law the [[National School Lunch Program]] to provide low-cost or free [[School meal|school lunch meals]] to qualified students through subsidies to schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://federaleducationpolicy.wordpress.com/2011/02/19/1946-national-school-lunch-act/ Copy of the School Lunch Act As Enacted in 1946], Federal Education Policy History website&lt;/ref&gt; The program was established as a way to prop up food prices by absorbing farm surpluses, while at the same time providing food to school age children. It was named after Richard Russell, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/Lunch/AboutLunch/ProgramHistory_4.htm The National School Lunch Program Background and Development]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lake Placid Conference ===
Early in September, 1899, trustees of the [[Lake Placid Club]] (Morningside, New York) thought it was the right time to bring together those most interested in home science, or household economics and sent out many invitations for the Lake Placid Conference scheduled to take place Sept. 19-25, 1899. [[Melvil Dewey]], one of the club's trustees, personally invited Richards to attend.  She gave a lecture on standards of living and was elected chairman of the conference.&lt;ref name="LakePlacidConference"&gt;{{Citation | editor-last = Richards | editor-first = Ellen H. | title = Lake Placid Conference proceedings | series = Lake Placid Conference | year = 1901–1908 | pages =  | place = Lake Placid, NY | publisher = American Home Economics Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Home Economics Association ===
In 1908, Richards was chosen as the first president of the newly formed American Home Economics Association, which was renamed the [[American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences]] in 1994. She also founded and funded the Association's periodical, the ''Journal of Home Economics'', which began publication in 1909. It was renamed the ''Journal of Family and Consumer Sciences'' in 1994 when the Association changed its name.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Her books and writings on this topic include ''Food Materials and their Adulterations'' (1886); ''Conservation by Sanitation''; ''The Chemistry of Cooking and Cleaning''; ''The Cost of Living'' (1899); ''Air, Water, and Food'' (1900); ''The Cost of Food''; ''The Cost of Shelter''; ''The Art of Right Living''; ''The Cost of Cleanness''; ''Sanitation in Daily Life'' (1907); and ''[[Euthenics]], the Science of Controllable Environment'' (1910). Some of these went through several editions.

== Death ==
Richards died on March 30, 1911 at her home in [[Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts]] after suffering with [[angina]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Mrs. Ellen H.

In [[pharmacology]], an '''endogenous agonist''' for a particular [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] is a compound naturally produced by the body which binds to and [[agonist|activates]] that receptor. For example, the primary endogenous agonist for [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]] is [[serotonin]], and the primary endogenous agonist for [[dopamine receptor]]s is [[dopamine]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman and Gilman's Manual of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. (11th edition, 2008). p14. {{ISBN|0-07-144343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, receptors for [[small molecule]] [[neurotransmitter]]s such as serotonin will have only one endogenous agonist, but often have many different receptor subtypes (e.g. 13 different [[serotonin receptor|receptors for serotonin]]). On the other hand, [[neuropeptide]] receptors tend to have fewer subtypes, but may have several different endogenous agonists. This allows for a high degree of complexity in the bodies signalling system, with different tissues often showing quite distinct responses to a particular [[ligand]]. Some endogenous [[Antagonist (pharmacology)|antagonists]] and [[inverse agonist]]s are also known (e.g., [[kynurenic acid]] at the [[NMDA receptor]]), but these are much less common.

{{expand German|Energietechnik|date=April 2015}}

'''Energy technology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[engineering]] [[science]] having to do with the efficient, safe, [[environmentally friendly]] and economical extraction, conversion, transportation, storage and use of [[energy]], targeted towards yielding high efficiency whilst skirting [[adverse effect|side effects]] on humans, nature and the environment.

For people, energy is an overwhelming need and as a scarce [[resource]] it has been an underlying cause of political conflicts and wars. The gathering and use of energy resources can be harmful to local ecosystems and may have global outcomes.

==Interdisciplinary fields==
As an interdisciplinary science Energy technology is linked with many interdisciplinary fields in sundry, overlapping ways.

* [[Physics]], for [[thermodynamics]] and [[nuclear physics]]
* [[Chemistry]] for [[fuel]], [[combustion]], [[air pollution]], [[flue gas]], [[battery (electricity)|battery]] technology and [[fuel cells]].
* [[Electrical engineering]]
* [[Engineering]], often for fluid energy machines such as [[combustion engines]], turbines, pumps and [[compressors]].
* [[Geography]], for [[geothermal]] energy and exploration for resources.
* [[Mining]], for [[petrochemical]] and [[fossil fuels]].
* [[Agriculture]] and [[forestry]], for sources of renewable energy.
* [[Meteorology]] for [[wind]] and [[solar energy]].
* [[Water]] and [[Waterways]], for [[hydropower]].
* [[Waste management]], for environmental impact.
* [[Transportation]], for energy-saving transportation systems.
* [[Environmental studies]], for studying the effect of energy use and production on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], [[nature]] and [[climate change]].
* (Lighting Technology), for Interior and Exterior Natural as well as Artificial Lighting Design, Installations, and Energy Savings
* (Energy Cost/Benefit Analysis), for Simple Payback and Life Cycle Costing of Energy Efficiency/Conservation Measures Recommended

==Electrical engineering==
[[Image:Qatar, power lines (6).jpg|thumb|High-voltage lines for the long distance transportation of electrical energy]]

[[Electric power engineering]] deals with the production and use of [[electrical energy]], which can entail the study of machines such as [[Electrical generator|generators]], [[electric motor]]s and [[transformer]]s. [[Infrastructure]] involves [[Electrical substation|substations]] and [[transformer station]]s, [[power line]]s and [[Power cable|electrical cable]]. [[Load management]] and [[power management]] over networks have meaningful sway on overall energy efficiency. [[Electric heating]] is also widely used and researched.

==Thermodynamics==
{{Main article|Thermodynamics}}

[[Thermodynamics]] deals with the fundamental laws of energy conversion and is drawn from theoretical [[Physics]].

==Thermal and chemical energy==
[[Image:Wood-fired grate stoker.jpg|thumb|left|A [[wikt:grate|grate]] for a wood fire]]
Thermal and chemical energy are intertwined with [[chemistry]] and [[environmental studies]]. [[Combustion]] has to do with [[Gas burner|burner]]s and chemical [[engine]]s of all kinds, grates and [[incinerator]]s along with their energy efficiency, [[pollution]] and operational safety.

[[Exhaust gas]] purification technology aims to lessen [[air pollution]] through sundry mechanical, thermal and chemical cleaning methods. [[Emission control (disambiguation)|Emission control]] technology is a field of [[process engineering|process]] and [[chemical engineering]]. [[Boiler]] technology deals with the design, construction and operation of [[steam]] boilers and [[steam turbine|turbine]]s (also used in nuclear power generation, see below), drawn from [[applied mechanics]] and [[materials engineering]].

[[Energy conversion]] has to do with internal combustion engines, turbines, pumps, fans and so on, which are used for transportation, mechanical energy and power generation. High thermal and mechanical loads bring about operational safety worries which are dealt with through many branches of applied engineering science.
{{Clear}}

==Nuclear energy==
[[Image:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|A [[steam turbine]].]]
[[Nuclear technology]] deals with [[nuclear power]] production from [[nuclear reactor]]s, along with the processing of nuclear fuel and disposal of radioactive waste, drawing from applied [[nuclear physics]], [[nuclear chemistry]] and [[radiation]] science.

Nuclear power generation has been politically controversial in many countries for several decades but the electrical energy produced through [[nuclear fission]] is of worldwide importance. There are high hopes that [[Fusion power|fusion]] technologies will one day replace most fission reactors but this is still a research area of [[nuclear physics]].

==Renewable energy==
{{Main article|Renewable energy}}
[[Image:Nellis AFB Solar panels.jpg|thumb|Solar ([[photovoltaic]]) panels at a military base in the US.]]
[[Renewable energy]] has many branches.

===Solar power===
{{Main article|Solar power}}

* [[Photovoltaic]] power draws electricity from solar radiation through [[solar cells]], either locally or in large photovoltaic power plants and uses [[semiconductor]] technology.
* [[Solar heating]] uses [[solar panel]]s which gather heat from sunlight to heat buildings and water.
* [[Solar thermal power]] produces electricity by converting solar heat.

===Wind power===
[[Image:WindMills.jpg|right|thumb|[[Wind turbine]]s on [[Inner Mongolia]]n grassland]]
{{Main article|Wind power}}

[[Wind turbine]]s draw energy from atmospheric currents and are designed using [[aerodynamics]] along with knowledge taken from mechanical and electrical engineering.

===Geothermal===
{{Main article|Geothermal}}

Where it can be had, [[geothermal]] energy is used for heating and electricity.

===Hydropower===
[[Image:Walchenseewerk Pelton 120.jpg|thumb|Building of [[Pelton turbine|Pelton water turbine]]s in [[Germany]].]]
{{Main article|Hydropower}}

Hydropower draws mechanical energy from rivers, [[wave power plant|ocean waves]] and [[tidal power|tides]]. [[Civil engineering]] is used to study and build [[dam]]s, [[tunnel]]s, [[waterways]] and manage coastal resources through [[hydrology]] and [[geology]]. A low speed [[water turbine]] spun by flowing water can power an [[electrical generator]] to produce electricity.

===Bioenergy===
{{Main article|Bioenergy}}
Bioenergy deals with the gathering, processing and use of biomasses grown in biological manufacturing, [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] from which [[power plant]]s can draw burning fuel. [[Ethanol]], [[methanol]] (both controversial) or hydrogen for [[fuel cells]] can be had from these technologies and used to generate electricity.

===Enabling technologies===

[[Heat pumps]] and [[Thermal energy storage]] are classes of technologies that can enable the utilization of renewable energy sources that would otherwise be inaccessible due to a temperature that is too low for utilization or a time lag between when the energy is available and when it is needed. While enhancing the temperature of available renewable thermal energy, heat pumps have the additional property of leveraging electrical power (or in some cases mechanical or thermal power) by using it to extract additional energy from a low quality source (such as seawater, lake water, the ground, the air, or [[waste heat]] from a process).

Thermal storage technologies allow heat or cold to be stored for periods of time ranging from hours or overnight to [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|interseasonal]], and can involve storage of [[Sensible heat|sensible energy]] (i.e. by changing the temperature of a medium) or [[latent energy]] (i.e. through phase changes of a medium, such between water and slush or ice). Short-term thermal storages can be used for peak-shaving in district heating or electrical distribution systems. Kinds of renewable or alternative energy sources that can be enabled include natural energy (e.g. collected via solar-thermal collectors, or dry cooling towers used to collect winter's cold), waste energy (e.g. from HVAC equipment, industrial processes or power plants), or surplus energy (e.g. as seasonally from hyropower projects or intermittently from wind farms). The [[Drake Landing Solar Community]] (Alberta, Canada) is illustrative. [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|borehole thermal energy storage]] allows the community to get 97% of its year-round heat from solar collectors on the garage roofs, which most of the heat collected in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Bill (June 28, 2011), [http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf "Drake Landing Solar Community"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030520/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2011Annual_Conf/Proceedings/A24WONG-v03.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, IDEA/CDEA District Energy/CHP 2011 Conference, Toronto, pp. 1–30, retrieved 21 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wong B., Thornton J.

Some types of storage are capable of storing heat or cold [[Seasonal thermal energy storage|between opposing seasons]] (particularly if very large), and some storage applications require inclusion of a [[Heat pumps|heat pump]]. Latent heat is typically stored in ice tanks or what are called [[phase-change material]]s (PCMs).

'''''Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies''''' is the 1623 published collection of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays. Modern scholars commonly refer to it as the '''First Folio'''.{{efn|More generally, the term ''first folio'' is employed in other appropriate contexts, as in connection with the [[Ben Jonson folios|first folio collection of Ben Jonson's works]] (1616), or the first folio collection of the plays in the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|Beaumont and Fletcher canon]] (1647).}} The First Folio is considered one of the most influential books ever published in the English language.{{sfn|The Guardian|2015}}

Printed in [[Folio (printing)|folio]] format and containing 36 plays (see [[Shakespeare's plays#Canonical plays|list of Shakespeare's plays]]), it was prepared by Shakespeare's colleagues [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]]. It was dedicated to the "incomparable pair of brethren" [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]] and his brother [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert]], Earl of Montgomery (later 4th Earl of Pembroke).

Although 18 of Shakespeare's plays had been published in [[quarto]] before 1623, the First Folio is arguably the only reliable text for about 20 of the plays, and a valuable source text for many of those previously published. The Folio includes all of the plays generally accepted to be Shakespeare's, with the exception of ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''; ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]''; and the two [[lost work|lost plays]], ''[[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]'' and ''[[Love's Labour's Won]]''.

On 23 April 1616,{{efn|Dates follow the [[Julian calendar]], used in England throughout Shakespeare's lifespan, but with the start of the year adjusted to 1 January (see [[Old Style and New Style dates]]). Under the [[Gregorian calendar]], adopted in Catholic countries in 1582, Shakespeare died on 3 May.{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1987|p=xv}}}} [[William Shakespeare]] died in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], and was buried in the [[chancel]] of the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon|Church of the Holy Trinity]] two days later.

[[William Basse]] wrote an elegiac poem on him {{circa|1618–20}}, but no notices were taken of his death in diplomatic correspondence or newsletters on the continent, nor were any tributes published by European contemporaries. [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]]—who at the time held the post of [[Lord Chamberlain]], with authority over the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], and directly in charge of Shakespeare as a [[Groom of the Chamber]]—made no note of his passing.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2016}}{{efn|[[Stephen Greenblatt]], in an article for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', points to the difference in social status: "A grand aristocrat … could [not readily] show a connection to a social nonentity—a bourgeois entrepreneur and playwright without Oxbridge honors or family distinction …."{{sfn|Greenblatt|2016}}}}

Shakespeare's works—both poetic and dramatic—had a rich history in print before the publication of the First Folio: from the first publications of ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (1593) and ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'' (1594), 78 individual printed editions of his works are known. {{circa|30%}} (23) of these editions are his poetry, and the remaining {{circa|70%}} (55) his plays. Counting by number of editions published before 1623, the best-selling works were ''Venus and Adonis'' (12 editions), ''The Rape of Lucrece'' (6 editions), and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' (6 editions). Of the 23 editions of the poems, 16 were published in [[octavo]]; the rest, and almost all of the editions of the plays, were printed in [[quarto]].{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=6}} The quarto format was made by folding a large sheet of printing paper twice, forming 4 leaves with 8 pages. The average quarto measured {{convert|7|by|9|in|cm}} and was made up of {{circa|9}} sheets, giving 72 total pages.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=2–3}} Octavos—made by folding a sheet of the same size three times, forming 8 leaves with 16 pages—were about half as large as a quarto.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=6}} Since the cost of paper represented {{circa|50–75%}} of a book's total production costs,{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=2–3}} octavos were generally cheaper to manufacture than quartos, and a common way to reduce publishing costs was to reduce the number of pages needed by compressing (using two columns or a smaller typeface) or abbreviating the text.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=6}}

Editions of individual plays were typically published in quarto and could be bought for 6[[Penny (English coin)|d]] ({{inflation|UK|0.025|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) without a binding. These editions were primarily intended to be cheap and convenient, and read until worn out or repurposed as wrapping paper (or worse), rather than high quality objects kept in a library.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=2–3}} Customers who wanted to keep a particular play would have to have it bound, and would typically bind several related or miscellany plays into one volume.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=10}} Octavos, though nominally cheaper to produce, were somewhat different. From {{circa|1595–6}} (''Venus and Adonis'') and 1598 (''The Rape of Lucrece''), Shakespeare's narrative poems were published in octavo.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=7}} In ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's First Folio'', Tara L. Lyons argues that this was partly due to the publisher, [[John Harrison (stationer)|John Harrison]]'s, desire to capitalize on the poems' association with [[Ovid]]: the Greek classics were sold in octavo, so printing Shakespeare's poetry in the same format would strengthen the association.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=8}} The octavo generally carried greater prestige, so the format itself would help to elevate their standing.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=7}} Ultimately, however, the choice was a financial one: ''Venus and Adonis'' in octavo needed four sheets of paper, versus seven in quarto, and the octavo ''The Rape of Lucrece'' needed five sheets, versus 12 in quarto.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=8}} Whatever the motivation, the move seems to have had the intended effect: [[Francis Meres]], the first known literary critic to comment on Shakespeare, in his ''Palladis Tamia'' (1598), puts it thus: "the sweete wittie soule of ''Ouid'' liues in mellifluous &amp; hony-tongued ''Shakespeare'', witnes his ''Venus'' an''d'' ''Adonis'', his ''Lucrece'', his sugred Sonnets among his priuate friends".{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=8–9}}

Publishing literary works in folio was not unprecedented. Starting with the publication of Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]'' (1593) and ''[[Astrophel and Stella]]'' (1598), both published by [[William Ponsonby (publisher)|William Ponsonby]], there was a significant number of folios published, and a significant number of them were published by the men who would later be involved in publishing the First Folio.{{efn|[[Edward Fairfax]]'s translation of [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Jerusalem Delivered|Godfrey of Bulloigne]]'' (1600), [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[Troia Britanica]]'' (1609), and [[Boccaccio]]’s ''[[Decameron]]'' (1620) was published in folio by [[William Jaggard|William]] and Isaac Jaggard; [[Montaigne]]’s ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (1603, 1613), [[Samuel Daniel]]’s ''[[Panegyricke Congratulatory]]'' (1603), [[Lucan]]’s ''[[Pharsalia]]'' (1614), and [[James Mabbe]]'s translation of [[Mateo Alemán]]’s ''[[Guzmán de Alfarache|The Rogue]]'' (1623) were published by [[Edward Blount]]; and [[John Smethwick]] published [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Ben Jonson folios|Works]]'' (1616), and [[Michael Drayton]]'s ''[[Poems (Drayton)|Poems]]'' (1619). All told, a quarter of the literary folios produced in London between 1600 and 1623 were the work of these three publishers.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2016|p=26}}}} But quarto was the typical format for plays printed in the period: folio was a prestige format, typically used, according to [[Fredson Bowers]], for books of "superior merit or some permanent value".{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=1}} &lt;!-- TODO: Needs mention of Jonson's Folio, and perhaps a few words about Beaumont and Fletcher? Xover, 15 April 2018. --&gt;

==Printing==
The contents of the First Folio were compiled by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]];{{sfn|Edmondson|2015|pp=321–323}} the members of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]] who published the book were the booksellers [[Edward Blount]] and the father/son team of [[William Jaggard|William and Isaac Jaggard]]. William Jaggard has seemed an odd choice by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] because he had published the questionable collection ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' as Shakespeare's, and in 1619 had printed new editions of 10 Shakespearean quartos to which he did not have clear rights, some with false dates and title pages (the [[False Folio]] affair). Indeed, his contemporary [[Thomas Heywood]], whose poetry Jaggard had pirated and misattributed to Shakespeare, specifically reports that Shakespeare was "much offended with M. ''Jaggard'' (that altogether unknown to him) presumed to make so bold with his name."{{sfn|Erne|2013|p=26}}

Heminges and Condell emphasised that the Folio was replacing the earlier publications, which they characterised as "stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors", asserting that Shakespeare's true words "are now offer'd to your view cured, and perfect of their limbes; and all the rest, absolute in their numbers as he conceived them."

The paper industry in England was then in its infancy and the quantity of quality [[History of paper|rag paper]] for the book was imported from France.{{sfn|Higgins|2016|p=41}} It is thought that the [[typesetting]] and printing of the First Folio was such a large job that the King's Men simply needed the capacities of the Jaggards' shop. William Jaggard was old, infirm and blind by 1623, and died a month before the book went on sale; most of the work in the project must have been done by his son Isaac.
[[File:Bad quarto, good quarto, first folio.png|thumb|320px|Comparison of the "[[To be, or not to be]]" soliloquy in the first three editions of Hamlet, showing the varying quality of the text in the [[Bad Quarto]], the Good Quarto and the First Folio]]

The First Folio's publishing syndicate also included two stationers who owned the rights to some of the individual plays that had been previously printed: [[William Aspley]] (''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'') and [[John Smethwick]] (''[[Love's Labour's Lost]],'' ''[[Romeo and Juliet]],'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''). Smethwick had been a business partner of another Jaggard, William's brother John.

The printing of the Folio was probably done between February 1622 and early November 1623. It is possible that the printer originally expected to have the book ready early, since it was listed in the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] catalogue as a book to appear between April and October 1622, but the catalog contained many books not yet printed by 1622, and the modern consensus is that the entry was simply intended as advance publicity.{{sfn|Higgins|2016|p=42–44}} The first impression had a publication date of 1623, and the earliest record of a retail purchase is an account book entry for 5 December 1623 of [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Edward Dering]] (who purchased two); the [[Bodleian Library]], in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], received its copy in early 1624 (which it subsequently sold for £24 as a superseded edition when the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Third Folio]] became available in 1663/1664).{{sfn|Smith|1939|pp=257–264}}

==Contents==
The 36 plays of the First Folio occur in the order given below; plays that had never been published before 1623 are marked with an asterisk. Each play is followed by the type of source used, as determined by bibliographical research.{{sfn|Evans|1974}}&lt;!-- FIXME: This needs better, more up to date and specific, sourcing. This cite, as it stands, covers the entire list of plays below. So it should be replaced with specific cites to a modern edition for each play listed. Xover, 31 March 2018. --&gt;

The term ''[[foul papers]]'' refers to Shakespeare's working drafts of a play. When completed, a transcript or ''fair copy'' of the foul papers would be prepared, by the author or by a scribe. Such a manuscript would have to be heavily annotated with accurate and detailed stage directions and all the other data needed for performance, and then could serve as a ''[[prompt book]]'', to be used by the [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]] to guide a performance of the play. Any of these manuscripts, in any combination, could be used as a source for a printed text. On rare occasions a printed text might be annotated for use as a prompt book, as may have been the case with ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The label Q''n'' denotes the ''n''th quarto edition of a play.

;Comedies
* 1 ''[[The Tempest]]'' * – the play was set into type from a manuscript prepared by [[Ralph Crane]], a professional [[scrivener]] employed by the King's Men. Crane produced a high-quality result, with formal act/scene divisions, frequent use of parentheses and hyphenated forms, and other identifiable features.
* 2 ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' * – another transcript by Ralph Crane.
* 3 ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' – another transcript by Ralph Crane.
* 4 ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' * – probably another Ralph Crane transcript.

* 6 ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' – typeset from a copy of the quarto, lightly annotated.
* 7 ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' – typeset from a corrected copy of Q1.
* 8 ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' – typeset from a copy of Q2, well-annotated, possibly used as a prompt-book.

;Histories
* 15 ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'' * – uncertain: a prompt-book, or "foul papers."
* 16 ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' – typeset from Q3 and Q5, corrected against a prompt-book.
* 17 ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' – typeset from an edited copy of Q5.
* 18 ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' – uncertain: some combination of manuscript and quarto text.
* 19 ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' – typeset from Shakespeare's "foul papers."
* 20 ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' * – likely from an annotated transcript of the author's manuscript.
* 21 ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' – probably a Shakespearean manuscript used as a prompt-book.
* 22 ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' – like 2H6, probably a Shakespearean prompt-book.
* 23 ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' – a difficult case: probably typeset partially from Q3, and partially from Q6 corrected against a manuscript (maybe "foul papers").
* 24 ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' * – typeset from a fair copy of the authors' manuscript.
;Tragedies
* 25 ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' – probably typeset from the quarto, corrected with Shakespeare's "foul papers," printed after the rest of the Folio was completed.
* 26 ''[[Coriolanus]]'' * – set from a high-quality authorial transcript.
* 27 ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' – typeset from a copy of Q3 that might have served as a prompt-book.
* 28 ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' – in essence a reprint of Q3.
* 29 ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' * – set from Shakespeare's foul papers or a transcript of them.
* 30 ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' * – set from a prompt-book, or a transcript of a prompt-book.
* 31 ''[[Macbeth]]'' * – probably set from a prompt-book, perhaps detailing an adaptation of the play for a short indoor performance
* 32 ''[[Hamlet]]'' – one of the most difficult problems in the First Folio: probably typeset from some combination of Q2 and manuscript sources.
* 33 ''[[King Lear]]'' – a difficult problem: probably set mainly from Q1 but with reference to Q2, and corrected against a prompt-book.
* 34 ''[[Othello]]'' – another difficult problem: probably typeset from Q1, corrected with a quality manuscript.
* 35 ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' * – possibly "foul papers" or a transcript of them.
* 36 ''[[Cymbeline]]'' * – possibly another Ralph Crane transcript, or else the official prompt-book.

''Troilus and Cressida'' was originally intended to follow ''Romeo and Juliet'', but the typesetting was stopped, probably due to a conflict over the rights to the play; it was later inserted as the first of the tragedies, when the rights question was resolved. It does not appear in the table of contents.{{sfn|Halliday|1964}}{{pn|date=March 2018}}

==Introductory Poem==
[[Ben Jonson]] wrote a preface to the folio with this poem facing the Droeshout portrait:
{{Poemquote|text=This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut:
 Wherein the Grauer had a strife
 with Nature, to out-doo the life:
 O, could he but haue dravvne his vvit
 As vvell in brasse, as he hath hit
 His face; the Print vvould then surpasse
 All, that vvas euer vvrit in brasse.
 But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
 Not on his picture, but his Booke.

B.J.}}

==Compositors==
As far as modern scholarship has been able to determine,{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=113}} the First Folio texts were set into type by five compositors, with different spelling habits, peculiarities, and levels of competence. Researchers have labelled them A through E, A being the most accurate, and E an apprentice who had significant difficulties in dealing with manuscript copy. Their shares in typesetting the pages of the Folio break down like this:

{| class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
! Comedies
! Histories
! Tragedies
! Total pages
|-
| "A"
| 74
| 80
| 40
| '''194'''
|-
| "B"
| 143
| 89
| 213
| '''445'''
|-
| "C"
| 79
| 22
| 19
| '''120'''
|-
|"D"
| {{frac|35|1|2}}
| 0

| '''{{frac|35|1|2}}'''
|-
|"E"
| 0
| 0
| {{frac|71|1|2}}
| '''{{frac|71|1|2}}'''
|}

Compositor "E" was most likely one John Leason, whose apprenticeship contract dated only from 4 November 1622. One of the other four might have been a John Shakespeare, of [[Warwickshire]], who apprenticed with Jaggard in 1610–17. ("Shakespeare" was a common name in Warwickshire in that era; John was no known relation to the playwright.)

== The First Folio and variants ==
[[File:First Folio VA.jpg|thumb|The First Folio ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London)]]
[[W. W. Greg]] has argued that [[Edward Knight (King's Men)|Edward Knight]], the "book-keeper" or "book-holder" ([[prompter (theatre)|prompter]]) of the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], did the actual proofreading of the manuscript sources for the First Folio. Knight is known to have been responsible for maintaining and annotating the company's scripts, and making sure that the company complied with cuts and changes ordered by the [[Master of the Revels]].

Some pages of the First Folio – 134 out of the total of 900 – were proofread and corrected while the job of printing the book was ongoing. As a result, the Folio differs from modern books in that individual copies vary considerably in their typographical errors. There were about 500 corrections made to the Folio in this way.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=390}} These corrections by the typesetters, however, consisted only of simple typos, clear mistakes in their own work; the evidence suggests that they almost never referred back to their manuscript sources, let alone tried to resolve any problems in those sources. The well-known [[crux (literary)|cruxes]] in the First Folio texts were beyond the typesetters' capacity to correct.

The Folio was typeset and bound in "sixes" – 3 sheets of paper, taken together, were folded into a booklet-like quire or gathering of 6 leaves, 12 pages. Once printed, the "sixes" were assembled and bound together to make the book. The sheets were printed in 2-page formes, meaning that pages 1 and 12 of the first quire were printed simultaneously on one side of one sheet of paper (which became the "outer" side); then pages 2 and 11 were printed on the other side of the same sheet (the "inner" side). The same was done with pages 3 and 10, and 4 and 9, on the second sheet, and pages 5 and 8, and 6 and 7, on the third. Then the first quire could be assembled with its pages in the correct order. The next quire was printed by the same method: pages 13 and 24 on one side of one sheet, etc. This meant that the text being printed had to be "cast off" – the compositors had to plan beforehand how much text would fit onto each page. If the compositors were setting type from manuscripts (perhaps messy, revised and corrected manuscripts), their calculations would frequently be off by greater or lesser amounts, resulting in the need to expand or compress. A line of verse could be printed as two; or verse could be printed as prose to save space, or lines and passages could even be omitted (a disturbing prospect for those who prize Shakespeare's works).{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=319}}

== Performing Shakespeare using the First Folio ==

Some Shakespeare directors and theatre companies producing Shakespeare believe that while modern editions of Shakespeare's plays, which are heavily edited and changed, are more readable, they remove possible actor cues found in the Folio, such as capitalization, different punctuation and even the changing or removal of whole words. Among the theatre companies that have based their production approach upon use of the First Folio was the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]], which, in the early 1980s, began a studied approach to their stage productions relying upon the First Folio as their textual guide. In the 1990s, the First Folio was reissued in a paperback format more accessible to the general public.{{sfn|Moston|1995|p=vii}}{{fv|date=April 2018|reason=The introduction starts on page ix, so page vii must be some other prefatory matter, possibly the publisher's sales copy for the book. The cite also only plausibly covers the last sentence of this paragraph.}}

Today, many theatre companies and festivals producing the works of Shakespeare use the First Folio as the basis for their theatrical productions and training programmes, including London's Original Shakespeare Company, a theatre company which works exclusively from cue scripts drawn from the First Folio.{{sfn|Tucker|2002|p=}}{{pn|date=April 2018}}

However, what are now the widely accepted versions of these plays include lines taken from the Quartos, which are not in the First Folio. For instance, small passages of ''Hamlet'' are omitted – among them Horatio's line "A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye", and his subsequent speech beginning with "In the most high and palmy state of Rome, / A little ere the mightiest Julius fell..." Also missing is Hamlet's encounter with the Norwegian captain from Fortinbras's army in Act IV, Scene IV, along with perhaps the most important cut, the soliloquy "How all occasions do inform against me". ''Romeo and Juliet'' omits the prologue, with its famous line about "a pair of [[star-crossed]] lovers".

==Holdings, sales and valuations==
Jean-Christophe Mayer, in ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's First Folio'' (2016), estimates the original retail price of the First Folio to be about 15[[Shilling (English coin)|s]] ({{inflation|UK|0.75|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) for an unbound copy, and up to [[pound sterling|£]]1 ({{inflation|UK|1|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) for one bound in [[calfskin]].{{efn|He also cites previous estimates from Anthony James West, based in part on unpublished estimates by Peter Blayney, that the publisher's cost was about 6s 8[[Penny (English coin)|d]] ({{inflation|UK|0.33|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}), and the wholesale price no more than 10s ({{inflation|UK|0.5|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).{{sfn|Mayer|2016|p=105}}&lt;!-- FIXME: The modern prices, generated by [[Template:inflation]], need citations.

In April 2016 another new discovery was announced, a First Folio having been found in [[Mount Stuart House]] on the [[Isle of Bute]], [[Scotland]]. It was authenticated by [[Emma J. Smith|Professor Emma Smith]] of Oxford University.{{sfn|Coughlan|2016}} The Folio originally belonged to [[Isaac Reed]].{{sfn|Smith|2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">The '''four field approach''' in [[anthropology]] sees the discipline as composed of the four subfields of [[Archaeology]], [[Linguistics]], [[Physical Anthropology]] and [[Cultural anthropology]]. The approach is conventionally understood as having been developed by [[Franz Boas]] who developed the discipline of anthropology in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, E. N. (2003), Four-Field Anthropology. Anthropology News, 44: 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Beck Kehoe. 1998. Humans:  An Introduction to Four-Field Anthropology. Psychology Press, 1998 - Social Science&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 re-assessment of the evidence has indicated that the idea of four-field anthropology has a more complex 19th-century history in Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Dan|title=Four Field Anthropology: Charter Myths and Time Warps from St. Louis to Oxford|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 2013|volume=54|issue=6|pages=753|jstor=10.1086/673385|doi=10.1086/673385 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Boas, the four field approach was motivated by his [[Holism|holistic]] approach to the study of human behavior, which included integrated analytical attention to culture history, material culture, [[anatomy]] and population history, customs and social organization, [[folklore]], grammar and language use. For most of the 20th century, U.S. Anthropology departments housed anthropologists specializing in all of the four branches, but with the increasing professionalization and specialization, elements such as [[linguistics]] and [[archaeology]] came to be regarded largely as separate disciplines. Today, physical anthropologists often collaborate more closely with biology and medicine than with cultural anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Borofsky, R. (2002), The Four Subfields: Anthropologists as Mythmakers. American Anthropologist, 104: 463–480.&lt;/ref&gt;

Global concerns about the '''gender disparity in computing''' occupations have gained more importance with the emerging [[information age]]. These concerns motivated [[public policy]] debates addressing [[gender equality]] as computer applications exerted increasing influence in society. This dialogue helped to expand information technology innovations and to reduce the consequences of [[sexism]].

== Background ==
{{See also|Women in computing}}
In the early days of computers and computing, women were well-represented in the field.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-“computer-geeks”-replaced-“computergirls”|title=Researcher reveals how “Computer Geeks” replaced “Computer Girls”|last=Frink|first=Brenda D.|date=1 June 2011|website=Gender News|publisher=Stanford University|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312130252/http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/researcher-reveals-how-%E2%80%9Ccomputer-geeks%E2%80%9D-replaced-%E2%80%9Ccomputergirls%E2%80%9D#|archive-date=2015-03-12|dead-url=no|access-date=22 October 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women often worked as "human computers," making complicated calculations and working in large groups, such as the [[Harvard Computers]].{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=82}} Women also worked on ballistics calculations and cryptography.{{Sfn|Grier|2013|p=130}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/women-were-key-code-breaking-bletchley-park-180954044/|title=Women Were Key to WWII Code-Breaking at Bletchley Park|last=Fessenden|first=Marissa|work=Smithsonian|access-date=October 14, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human computers who were women could be paid less than their male counterparts.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=23}} By 1943, the majority of human computers were women.{{Sfn|Smith|2013|p=6}} Many early programmers on machines such as [[ENIAC]], were mostly women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reason that women were involved as programmers and human computers was because "they expected programming to be a low skill clerical function," and that the difficult work was the creation of the hardware, which male engineers largely worked on.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The programmers of the ENIAC, six women who designed the public demonstrations and prepared the machine for its public debut were not fully recognized for their contributions by the media.{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=51}}

By the 1960s, while computer programming was still touted as a good field for women to go into, major shifts were beginning to take place that would help push women out of the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Men who were programming started to make the field more "prestigious," creating professional associations, education requirements for work and by actively discouraging hiring women in the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hiring tools were introduced in which answers were shared among all-male groups and clubs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another way to push women out of the field was to use [[Personality test|personality tests]] that favored people who were not interested in working with others, which was slanted towards a certain type of male applicant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After these trends were entrenched in the industry, it has continued to perpetuate itself into the modern day.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some computer science programs, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], in the mid-1960s wouldn't even admit women into their program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4892094/google-diversity-history-memo/|title=Women in Tech and the History Behind That Controversial Google Diversity Memo|last=Waxman|first=Olvia B.|date=8 August 2017|website=Time|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender gap==
A survey, conducted by SWIFT ("Supporting Women in Information Technology") based in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, asked 7,411 participants questions about their career choices. The survey found that females tend to believe that they lack the skill set needed to be successful in the field of computing. This study (as well as others) provides a strong base for a positive correlation between perceived ability and career choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Chan, Vania |author2=Stafford, Katie |author3=Klawe, Maria |author4=Chen, Grace |title=Gender Differences in Vancouver Secondary Students' Interests Related to Information Technology Careers |publisher=Department of Computer Science, University of British Columbia |year=2000 |url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/swift/survey_stats/career_choice_survey/SurveyPaper.doc |access-date=2016-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221164825/http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/swift/survey_stats/career_choice_survey/SurveyPaper.doc# |archive-date=2007-02-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A project based in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], "Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society" (SIGIS) released its findings based on research conducted in 48 separate case studies all over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, Wendy (2004). [http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_Final_Public.pdf "Strategies of Inclusion: Gender and the Information Society - Final Report"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, SIGIS, University of Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings focus on recruiting as well as retention techniques for women already studying in the field. These techniques range from the introduction of role models, advertisement campaigns, and the allocation of quotas, in order to make the computing field appear more gender neutral.&lt;ref name="sigis"&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof Robin Williams|title=Getting More Women in Computer Science and Engineering|publisher=University of Edinburgh|url=http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_05_computing.pdf|access-date=2016-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716225701/http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/sigis/public/documents/SIGIS_D08_05_computing.pdf#|archive-date=2011-07-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educating reforms, which will increase the quality of the educating body and technological facilities, are also suggested.&lt;ref name="sigis" /&gt;

Research suggests that [[Malaysia]] has a much more equal split that varies around the half-way mark.&lt;ref name="mala"&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof. Vivian Anette Lagesen |title=A Cyberfeminist Utopia?: Perceptions of Gender and Computer Science among Malaysian Women Computer Science Students and Faculty|publisher=Sage Publications|url=http://sth.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/33/1/5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A job in the computing industry also implies a safe work environment. Strong belief by the previous generation that IT would be a flourishing sector with many job opportunities caused parents to encourage their children to take a computing career, no matter the gender.&lt;ref name="mala" /&gt;

In India, a growing number of women are studying and taking careers in technical fields. The percentage of women engineers graduating from IIT Bombay grew from 
1.8% in 1972 to 8% in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simard |first=Caroline |url=http://anitaborginstitute.org/files/womenhightechworld.pdf |format=PDF |title= The state of women and technology fields around the world |publisher= Anita Borg Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women in Arab societies|Arab women]] made up 59% of students enrolled in computer science in 2014 at government universities located in Saudi Arabia.{{Sfn|Islam|2017|p=13}} Women in [[Eastern Europe]], especially in Bulgaria and Romania, have high rates of pursuing coding and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/women-in-tech-why-bulgaria-and-romania-are-leading-in-software-engineering/|title=Women in tech: Why Bulgaria and Romania are leading in software engineering {{!}} ZDNet|last=Fiscutean|first=Andrada|date=13 June 2017|work=ZDNet|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women remain underrepresented in information technology fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Varma | first1 = Roli | year = 2010 | title = Computing self-efficiency among women in India | url = http://www.unm.edu/~varma/print/JWMSE_CS%20Self%20Efficacy.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Women and Minorities in Science and Engineering | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 257–274 | doi=10.1615/jwomenminorscieneng.v16.i3.40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistics in education===
In the United States, the proportion of women represented in undergraduate [[computer science]] education and the white-collar [[information technology]] workforce peaked in the mid-1980s, and has declined ever since. In 1984, 37.1% of [[Computer Science]] degrees were awarded to women; the percentage dropped to 29.9% in 1989-1990, and 26.7% in 1997-1998.&lt;ref&gt;Camp, Tracy (2001). [http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~women/resources/aroundTheWeb/hostedPapers/Syllabus-Camp.pdf "Women in Computer Science: Reversing the Trend"]. Colorado School of Mines.&lt;/ref&gt; Figures from the [[Computing Research Association]] Taulbee Survey indicate that fewer than 12% of Computer Science bachelor's degrees were awarded to women at U.S. PhD-granting institutions in 2010-11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cra.org/uploads/documents/resources/taulbee/CS_Degree_and_Enrollment_Trends_2010-11.pdf "Computing Degree and Enrollment Trends"], 2010-2011 CRA Taulbee Survey. The Computing Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although teenage girls are now using computers and the Internet at rates similar to their male peers, they are five times less likely to consider a technology-related career or plan on taking post-secondary technology classes.&lt;ref&gt;Melkymuka, Kathleen (8 January 2001). [http://www.computerworld.com/article/2590257/it-personnel/if-girls-don-t-get-it---it-won-t-get-girls.html "If Girls Don't Get IT, IT Won't Get Girls"], Computer World.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology]] (NCWIT) reports that of the [[SAT]] takers who intend to major in computer and information sciences, the proportion of girls has steadily decreased relative to the proportion of boys, from 20 percent in 2001 to 12 percent in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Stross, Randall  (15 November 2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/business/16digi.html?_r=0 "What Has Driven Women Out of Computer Science?"], The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  While this number has been decreasing, in 2001, the total number of these students (both boys and girls) reached its peak at 73,466.

According to a [[College Board]] report, in 2006 there were slightly more girls than boys amongst SAT takers that reported to having "course work or experience" in [[computer literacy]], word processing, internet activity, and creating spreadsheets/databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/cbsenior/yr2006/national-report.pdf 2006 College-Bound Seniors - Total Group Profile Report], CollegeBoard SAT.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also determined that more boys than girls (59% vs 41%) reported course work or experience with [[computer programming]], although this may likely be caused by false reporting. Of the 146,437 students (13%) who reported having ''no'' course work or experience, 61% were girls and 39% were boys.

More boys than girls take [[Advanced Placement]] (AP) Computer Science exams. According to the College Board in 2006, 2,594 girls and 12,068 boys took the AP Computer Science A exam, while 517 girls and 4,422 boys took the more advanced AP Computer Science AB exam. From 1996 to 2004, girls made up 16–17% of those taking the AP Computer Science A exam and around 10% of those taking AP Computer Science AB exam.

===Statistics in the workforce===
Women's representation in the computing and information technology workforce has been falling from a peak of 38% in the mid-1980s. From 1993 through 1999, NSF's SESTAT reported that the percentage of women working as computer/information scientists (including those who hold a bachelor's degree or higher in an S&amp;E field or have a bachelor's degree or higher and are working in an S&amp;E field) declined slightly from 33.1% to 29.6% percent while the absolute numbers increased from 170,500 to 185,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/us-workforce/ "Characteristics of Scientists and Engineers in the US"], National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Catalyst in 2006 indicated that women comprise 27-29% of the computing workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Misa, ed. (2010). ''Gender Codes: Why Women Are Leaving Computing''. Wiley/IEEE Computer Society Press. pp. 32-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; A [[National Public Radio]] report in 2013 stated that about 20% of all U.S. computer programmers are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode

==Benefits of gender diversity==
A gender-diverse team is more likely to create products that meet people's requirements. When women are underrepresented, many technical decisions are based on men's experiences, opinions, and judgement, resulting in a male-slanted bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aauw.org/research/solving-the-equation/|title=Solving the Equation: The Variables for Women's Success in Engineering and Computing|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a review of research on gender-diverse teams reveals that gender-diverse teams are more productive, more creative, and more able to stay on schedule and within budget, compared to homogenous teams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/impactgenderdiversitytechbusinessperformance_print.pdf|title=What Is the Impact of Gender Diversity on Technology Business Performance?: Research Summary|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other research review suggests that the results are mixed, with many studies showing no result, non-linear results or even negative results of gender diversity on team performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/16372408/received-wisdom-relationship-between-diversity-organizational-performance|title=RECEIVED WISDOM AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIVERSITY AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research conducted by [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] showed that companies with women in top management were more financially successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/is_there_a_payoff_from_top-team_diversity|title=Is there a payoff from top-team diversity?|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast analysis of sample major US companies showed no effect of inclusion of women (or minority members) on financial performance, these varied results give no conclusive evidence of the benefits of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00809.x/abstract|title=The Gender and Ethnic Diversity of US Boards and Board Committees and Firm Financial Performance|accessdate=25 August 2015 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8683.2010.00809.x|volume=18|journal=Corporate Governance: An International Review|pages=396–414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide'' states that the lack of participation of females in computing excludes them from the "new economy", which calls for sophisticated computer skills in exchange for high salary positions.&lt;ref name="digital divide"&gt;Cooper, J.; Weaver, K. (2003). ''Gender and Computers: Understanding the Digital Divide''. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. {{ISBN|0-8058-4427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors contributing to lack of female participation==

===Education===
Diminished participation by women relative to men in computer science dates from about 1984&lt;ref name=NSFstatistics&gt;{{cite web|title=TABLE 33. Computer sciences degrees awarded, by degree level and sex of recipient: 1966–2010|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf13327/pdf/tab33.pdf|publisher=NSF|accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; following mass marketing of personal computers to boys as toys to play games. Fiddling with computers by boys resulted in increased interest and readiness for computer science classes by young men.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite news|author1=Steve Henn|title=When Women Stopped Coding|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding|accessdate=December 26, 2014|work=Morning Edition|publisher=NPR|date=October 21, 2014|quote=The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of over 7000 high school students in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada]] showed that the degree of interest in the field of [[computer science]] for young women is comparably lower than that of young men.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Handcock, Mark S. et al. (2004). [https://www.webcitation.org/67YOr88gp?url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html "Focus on Women in Computer Science"], University of British Columbia. Archived from [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/wccce/program04/Papers/mark.html the original] on 10 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The same effect is seen in higher education; for instance, only 4% of female college freshmen expressed intention to major in computer science in the US.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt; Research has shown that some aspects about computing may discourage women. One of the biggest turn-offs is the "geek factor". High school girls often envisage a career in computing as a lifetime in an isolated cubicle writing code. The "geek factor" affects both male and female high school students, but it seems to have more of a negative effect on the female students.&lt;ref name="dean"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dean|first=Cornelia|title=Computer Science Takes Steps to Bring Women to the Fold|work=[[New York Times]]|date=17 April 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/science/17comp.html?_r=2&amp;8dpc=&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, computer programmers depicted in popular media are overwhelmingly male, contributing to an absence of role models for would-be female computer programmers.  However, in 2015, computer science has for the first time become the most popular major for female students at Stanford University.&lt;ref name=stanfordcs&gt;{{cite web|last1=McBride|first1=Sarah|title=Computer science now top major for women at Stanford University|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-women-technology-stanford-idUSKCN0S32F020151009|website=Reuters US Edition|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part to qualify for federal education funding distributed through the states, most U.S. states and districts now focus on ensuring that all students are at least "proficient" in mathematics and reading, making it difficult for teachers to focus on teaching concepts beyond the test. According to a Rand Corporation study, such a concentration on testing can cause administrators to focus resources on tested subjects at the expense of other subjects (e.g., science) or distract their attention from other needs.&lt;ref&gt;Stecher, B. M. (2002).  "Consequences of large-scale, high-stakes testing on school and classroom practice". In: Hamilton, L. S., B. M. Stecher, and S. P. Klein (Eds.). ''Making sense of test-based accountability in education''. Santa Monica, CA: Rand Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, computational thinking is unlikely to be taught either standalone or as integrated into other areas of study (e.g., mathematics, biology) anytime in the near future. The National Center for Women &amp; IT distributes free resources for increasing awareness of the need for teaching computer science in schools, including the "Talking Points" card, "Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncwit.org/resources.res.talking.curriculum.html Moving Beyond Computer Literacy: Why Schools Should Teach Computer Science] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529040434/http://www.ncwit.org/resources.res.talking.curriculum.html |date=May 29, 2012 }}, [[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Female and male perspectives===
[[File:Not_boyfriends_computer.jpg|thumb|The sticker reads, "No, this is not my boyfriend's computer."]]
According to a 1998–2000 ethnographic study by Jane Margolis and Allan Fisher at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], men and women viewed computers very differently. Women interviewees were more likely to state that they saw the computer as a tool for use within a larger societal and/or interdisciplinary context than did the men interviewed. On the other hand, men were more likely to express an interest in the computer as a machine.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, J. et al. (1999). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8515 ''Unlocking the Clubhouse''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713080000/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=8515 |date=July 13, 2012 }}. The MIT Press. p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, women interviewed in this study perceived that many of their male peers were "geeks," with limited social skills. Females often disliked the idea that computers "become their life."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The students observed and interviewed in that study were probably not representative of students in general, since at that time, in order to be admitted to CMU Computer Science a student needed to have some programming experience. More research is needed to understand the ability to generalize Margolis' and Fisher's findings.

A two-year research initiative published in 2000 by [[AAUW]] found that "Girls approach the computer as a "tool" useful primarily for what it can do; boys more often view the computer as a "toy" and/or an extension of the self. For boys, the computer is inherently interesting. Girls are interested in its instrumental possibilities, which may include its use as an artistic medium. They express scorn toward boys who confuse "real" power and power on a screen. "I see a computer as a tool," a high school girl declares. "You [might] go play Kung Fu Fighting, but in real life you are still a stupid little person living in a suburban way."&lt;ref&gt;AAUW Educational Foundation Commission on Technology, Gender, and Teacher Education (2000). [http://history.aauw.org/files/2013/01/TechSavvy.pdf "Tech Savvy: Educating Girls in the New Computer Age"], p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed as far back as 2000 that boys and girls use computers at about the same rates, albeit for somewhat different purposes.

Nearly 1000 students in [[University of Akron]] were surveyed, and it was discovered that females hold a more negative attitude towards computers than males.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt; Another study assessed the computer-related attitude of over 300 students in [[University of Winnipeg]] and obtained similar results.&lt;ref name="digital divide" /&gt;

This is thought to contribute to the gender disparity phenomenon in computing, in particular the females' early lack of interest in the field.&lt;ref name="digital divide"/&gt;

===Barriers to advancement===
Research on the barriers that women face in undergraduate computing&lt;ref&gt;Cohoon, J. McGrath; Aspray, William (2006). [http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10924 ''Women and Information Technology: Research on Underrepresentation''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106035820/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10924 |date=January 6, 2012 }}, Chapter 5. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has highlighted such factors as:

* Undergraduate classroom teaching in which the "weedout" practices and policies privileging competition over cooperation tend to advantage men.
* Laboratory climates in which women are seen as foreign and not belonging at best, and experience blatant hostility and sexism at worst.
* Well-meaning people who unwittingly create [[stereotype threat]] by reminding students that "women can do computing as well as men".
* Strong resistance to changing the system in which these and other subtle practices are continuously reproduced.

Just like in the pre-college situation, solutions are most often implemented outside of the mainstream (e.g., providing role models, mentoring, and women's groups), which can also create the perception among women, their male peers, and their professors that to be successful, women need "extra help" to graduate. Most people do not realize that the "extra help" is not academic, but instead access to the kind of peer networks more readily available to male students. Many women decline to participate in these extracurricular support groups because they do not want to appear deficient. In short, the conditions under which women (and underrepresented minority students) study computing are not the same as those experienced by men.

===Lack of acknowledgment and promotion of skills===
Women in technical roles often feel that the skills and feedback they bring to their jobs are not valued. According to a Catalyst report called "Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers", 65% of females in technical roles felt that those they reported to were receptive and responsive to their suggestions, as compared to 75% of women in non-technical roles.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"&gt;Foust-Cummings, Heather; Sabattini, Laura; Carter, Nancy (2008). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/36/women-in-technology-maximizing-talent-minimizing-barriers "Women in Technology: Maximizing Talent, Minimizing Barriers"]. Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt; This also speaks directly to the retention of females in the industry as females will commonly leave a company when they feel that what they are offering a company is not valued.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt; The report shows the concerns felt about this by sharing the following quote from an interviewee: "I would like to be involved with more projects than I am currently involved in; I feel that I am being underutilized. I would prefer my supervisor give me an opportunity to expand my skill sets and my responsibility at work".&lt;ref name="catalyst.org"/&gt;

However, it is not enough to just acknowledge skills. Women also lack the support and advocacy needed to promote these skills.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"&gt;(2003). [http://www.catalyst.org/publication/17/bit-by-bit-catalysts-guide-to-advancing-women-in-high-tech-companies "Bit by Bit: Catalyst's Guide to Advancing Women in High Tech Companies"]. Catalyst.&lt;/ref&gt; Women feel alone and at a loss because they lack role models, networks, and mentors.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"/&gt; These support systems not only help women develop talent and opportunities for career advancement, but they are also needed to promote women to more senior roles.&lt;ref name="catalyst.org 2"/&gt; It can be understood that advocacy is a major player in the advancement of females into senior tech roles.

===Stereotyping computer scientists===
Other research examines that undergraduates' stereotype of the people in computer science and how changing this stereotype through media can influence women's interest in computer science. Through this study they concluded that the image of computer science majors that is most prevalent in popular culture and in the minds of current undergraduates is someone who is highly intelligent, primarily obsessed with computers, and socially unskilled. This image can be considered to contrast with the more people-oriented, traditionally feminine image. According to this study, students continue to generate and propagate this stereotype when asked to describe people in computer science. Based on the results of their experiment based on this idea, they took a group of women and men undergraduates and had them read a stereotypical article and a non-stereotypical article. They found that women who read the non-stereotypical article were much more interested in computer science than those who read the article with the above-mentioned stereotypical computer science student.  Overall, they concluded that the underrepresentation of women in computing not due to women's lack of interest. The study contests the perception that college major decisions are free choices, instead they discuss the implications that the major decisions are more constrained by the prevalent stereotypes. This has a negative consequence such that it prevents women from developing an interest in these technical fields. The finding suggests that the stereotypical image of the computer scientists is unattractive to women who would otherwise be interested if presented with a true representation or role model from the computer science field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = The Stereotypical Computer Scientist: Gendered Media Representations As A Barrier To Inclusion For Women | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 69 | issue = 1/2| page = 58 | doi=10.1007/s11199-013-0296-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial stereotyping is also an issue, as computer scientists can often be thought of as white or Asian males, which can make it difficult for people who fall outside of those ethnicities to get hired. Non-white or Asian women may experience additional difficulty because they fail to match either half of the stereotype.&lt;ref name="Ortutay 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ortutay|first1=Barbara|title=Why is there so much attention but so little progress for diversity in tech?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/technology/ct-diversity-tech-little-progress-ap-bsi-20170125-story.html|accessdate=30 Apr 2017|work=chicagotribune.com|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=25 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it has been found that a women’s race is less likely to affect the probability of her choosing computing or a related field.&lt;ref name="Trusty 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trusty|first1=Jerry|title=Effects of high school course-taking and other variables on choice of science and mathematics college majors. (Research).|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|date=2002|volume=80|issue=4|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cases that subvert the stereotype of typical people in computing include the person coming from a family that is already involved in computing or a related field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kekelis|first1=Linda S.|last2=Ancheta|first2=Rebecca Wepsic|last3=Heber|first3=Etta|title=Hurdles in the pipeline: girls and technology careers.|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2005|volume=26|issue=1|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, coming from a family of a higher socioeconomic status is correlated to a higher likelihood of women choosing computing or a related field.&lt;ref name="Trusty 2002" /&gt; Yet, many computing companies only search for employees from prestigious schools, which leaves fewer opportunities.&lt;ref name="Ortutay 2017" /&gt;

===Fraternity-like startup environments===
The disproportionate number of startups in the computing industry, and the disproportionate hiring of primarily young workers, have created an environment in which many firms' technical teams consist largely of workers who are recent college graduates, sometimes giving the businesses fraternity-like cultures, leading to [[Sexism in the technology industry|sexism]] that discourages female participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/josephsteinberg/2014/09/18/heres-the-conversation-men-need-to-have-about-sexism-as-told-by-a-man/|title=Sexism In Startups: The Frank Conversation We Need To Be Having|first=Joseph|last=Steinberg|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon of fraternity-like environments among technology teams of startup firms has been termed ''brogrammer culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-03-01/the-rise-of-the-brogrammer|title=The Rise of the 'Brogrammer'|first=Douglas MacMillan|last=dmac1|date=2 March 2012|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bringing women into computing==
[[File:Computer_Repairing_Lilongwe_Malawi.jpg|thumb|Computer Repairing Lilongwe Malawi]]
The majority of data collected about women in IT has been qualitative analysis such as interviews and case studies. This data has been used to create effective programs addressing the underrepresentation of women in IT.&lt;ref&gt;Moody, J W; Beise, C M; Woszczynski, A B; Myers, M E. (2003).

Anita Borg Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of female college entrants expressing interest in majoring in computer science decreased in the 2000s to pre-1980's levels.&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite web|first=Andy |last=Eggers |title=Interest in computer science is volatile |url=http://www.iq.harvard.edu/blog/sss/archives/2008/11/interest_in_com.shtml |publisher=The Institute of Quantitative Social Science |date=17 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67YOs9Pdz?url=http://blogs.iq.harvard.edu/sss/archives/2008/11/interest_in_com.shtml |archivedate=10 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A research study was initialized by Allan Fisher, then Associate Dean for Undergraduate Computer Science Education at Carnegie Mellon University, and Jane Margolis, a social scientist and expert in gender equity in education, into the nature of this problem. The main issues discovered in interesting and retaining women in computer science were feelings of an experience gap, confidence doubts, interest in curriculum and pedagogy, and peer culture.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Lenore (2001). [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lblum/PAPERS/women_in_computer_science.pdf "Women in Computer Science: The Carnegie Mellon Experience"], Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science.&lt;/ref&gt; Universities across North America are changing their computer science programs to make them more appealing to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/23/358238982/to-get-women-to-work-in-computer-science-schools-get-them-to-class | title=To Get Women To Work In Computer Science, Schools Get Them To Class | publisher=NPR | date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proactive and positive exposures to early computer experiences, such as The Alice Project,&lt;ref name="Alice"&gt;[http://www.alice.org/index.php The Alice Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508000054/http://alice.org/index.php# |date=2012-05-08 }}, Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/ref&gt; founded by the late [[Randy Pausch]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], are thought to be effective in terms of retention and creation of enthusiasm for women who may later consider entering the field. Institutions of higher education are also beginning to make changes regarding the process and availability of mentoring to women that are undergraduates in technical fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sullivan|first=Patricia|author2=Kristen Moore |title=Time Talk: On Small Changes that Enact Infrastructural Mentoring for Undergraduate Women in Technical Fields|journal=Journal of Technical Writing &amp; Communication|year=2013|volume=43|issue=3|pages=333–354|doi=10.2190/TW.43.3.f|url=http://0-pq9se9hp4e.search.serialssolutions.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/?genre=article&amp;issn=00472816&amp;title=Journal+of+Technical+Writing+%26+Communication&amp;volume=43&amp;issue=3&amp;date=20130901&amp;atitle=Time+Talk%3a+On+Small+Changes+that+Enact+Infrastructural+Mentoring+for+Undergraduate+Women+in+Technical+Fields.&amp;spage=333&amp;pages=333-354&amp;sid=EBSCO:Academic+Search+Complete&amp;aulast=Sullivan%2c+Patricia|accessdate=30 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another strategy for addressing this issue has been early outreach to elementary and high-school girls. Programs like all-girl computer camps, girls' after-school computer clubs, and support groups for girls have been instilled to create more interest at a younger age.&lt;ref name="ramsey"/&gt; A specific example of this kind of program is the [[Canadian Information Processing Society]] outreach program, in which a representative is sent to schools in Canada, speaking specifically to grade nine girls about the benefits of Information Technology careers. The purpose is to inform girls about the benefits and opportunities within the field of information technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cips.ca/women "Women in IT"], Canada's Association of IT Professionals.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies like [[IBM]] also encourage young women to become interested in engineering, technology and science. IBM offers EX.I.T.E. (Exploring Interests in Technology and Engineering) camps for young women from the ages of 11 to 13.

Additionally, attempts are being made to make the efforts of female computer scientists more visible through events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women conference series which allows women in the field to meet, collaborate and present their work. In the U.S., the Association for Women in Computing was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1978. Its purpose is to provide opportunities for the professional growth of women in computing through networking, and through programs on technical and career-oriented topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awc-hq.org/home.html |title=Association for Women in Computing |publisher=Awc-hq.org |accessdate=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the [[British Computer Society]] (BCS) and other organizations have groups which promote the cause of women in computing, such as [[BCSWomen]], founded by [[Sue Black (computer scientist)|Sue Black]], and the BCS Women's Forum. In Ontario, Canada, the '''Gr8 Designs for Gr8 Girls''' program was founded to develop grade 8 girls' interest in computer science.

=== 2000s efforts ===

====National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology====
[[National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology|The National Center for Women &amp; IT]] (NCWIT) is currently one of the lead supporters of women's entry and retention in computing. Their goal is to help to create academic and work environments that are welcoming and fair for women. Their research shows that encouragement is one of the key elements to help women enter a primarily male-dominated field. They found women report more often than their male-counterpart that they entered computer science due to the influence of a teacher, family member, or friend's encouragement. Their findings conclude that support can make the difference in a woman's belief that she is competent enough to compete in computing. Thus, the NCWIT developed a program called Aspirations in Computing in order to provide girls with the necessary encouragement, a network of support, and female role models. In a survey done, nearly half of the girls polled said they would feel uncomfortable being the only girl in a group or class, one of the Aspirations main goals is to enable girls to feel less isolated in these predicaments. They have found that creating a sense of belonging or "fitting in" is fundamental for interest and current retention. The NCWIT Aspirations Award was created in order to involve women in a national competition, awardees are selected for their computing and IT aptitude, leadership skills, academics, and plans for graduate schooling. Due to their reach and awareness of the program, they saw a 54% increase in the girls applying in the 2013 season compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;DuBow, Wendy M., et al.

====Postsecondary education organization====
Numerous postsecondary education institutions have student-run organizations that focus on the advancement of women in computer science. In addition to she++ based out of [[Stanford University]], [[Rochester Institute of Technology]] (RIT) supports a chapter of the organization called Women In Computing. The campus's chapter of the organization is composed of students, faculty and staff at RIT and they strive to support and further develop the culture of computing to women. This effort is not only focused on their campus, but in the larger community. They host events both on their campus located in Henrietta, New York, and within surrounding Rochester schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rit.edu/gccis/women-computing|title=Women in Computing|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; RIT is among a national list of schools that host a chapter of Women in Computing, which is founded in the organization [[Association for Computing Machinery|Association of Computing Machinery]]'s committee for women in computing (ACM-W).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.acm.org/|title=Home|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University]] hosts the organization called Harvard Undergraduate Women in Computer Science (WiSC). The organization aims to promote women in computing across a variety of schools and industries, educate women on the profession of computer science, and provide opportunities for women in technical fields. WiCS supports the annual conference named WECode, a conference that aims to promote women's involvement in computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/innovation/blogs/inside-the-hive/2014/02/10/harvard-wecode-conference-welcomes-more-women-into-tech/jAlzh5KVabxMJQjhsjZa9N/blog.html|title=Harvard's WECode conference welcomes more women into tech|work=Boston.com|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2014/02/closing-the-gender-gap-in-computer-science/|title=Closing the gender gap in computer science|work=Harvard Gazette|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacesetters====
In an effort to improve the gender composition in computing, the Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT) created a nationwide U.S. program called "Pacesetters". Through this program, twenty-four academic and corporate organizations added close to 1,000 "Net New Women" to the field of computer science by 2012. These Net New Women are women in the sciences that had not originally intended on pursuing a computer science degree. Pacesetters is the first program of its kind where different organizations come together to identify effective ways to broaden the participation of women in computer science. There are currently more than 300 corporations, academic institutions, government agencies and non-profit organizations devoted to this cause. Together they build internal teams in order to develop and fund the needed programs and share their overall results. Pacesetters organizations include some very prestigious companies such as AT&amp;T, Intel, Microsoft, Google, Georgia Tech, Pfizer, and IBM to name a few. These are a few examples of their results due to the work with Pacesetters:

*[[Google]]: built a new programs for undergraduate women and held a career development panel of engineers which gave women the chance to participate in mock interviews. Due to these efforts, the number of women applicants grew and Google doubled the number of women in their software engineering summer internship program in 2011 compared to 2010.
*[[Intel]]: piloted a program called Command Presence Workshop in which senior technical women participated in specialized training,
*[[Virginia Tech]]: created a team of CS faculty, advisors, and student mentors to interact with potential female undergraduates and high school students. They saw a 56% increase in the number of female students who showed interest in their science programs.

== Relation to gender theory ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Csc as Possible major for woman.jpg|thumb|Possible Majors in C.Sc]] --&gt;
There are a number of thinkers who engage with gender theories and issues related to women and technology. Such thinkers include, for example, [[Donna Haraway]], [[Sadie Plant]], Julie Wosk, [[Sally Hacker|Sally L. Hacker]], [[Evelyn Fox Keller]], [[Janet Abbate]], [[Thelma Estrin]], and Thomas J. Misa, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Smith | first1 = Erika E | title = Recognizing a Collective Inheritance through the History of Women in Computing | url = | journal = CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture | volume = 15 | issue = 1| year = 2013 | doi = 10.7771/1481-4374.1972 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 book titled ''Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership'' uses [[Riane Eisler]]'s [[cultural transformation theory]] to offer an interdisciplinary, social systems perspective on issues of access to technology.&lt;ref name="kirkma"&gt;Kirk, Mary (2008). ''Gender and Information Technology: Moving Beyond Access to Co-Create Global Partnership''. Hershey, PA: IGI Global. {{ISBN|978-1-59904-786-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explores how shifting from dominator towards partnership systems—as reflected in four primary social institutions (communication, media, education, and business) - might help society move beyond the simplistic notion of access to co-create a real digital revolution worldwide.&lt;ref name="kirkma" /&gt;

A 2000 book titled ''Athena Unbound''&lt;ref name="etzkowitz"&gt;Etzkowitz, Henry; Kemelgor, Carol; Uzzi, Brian (2000). ''Athena Unbound - The advancement of women in science and technology'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-511-03833-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a life-course analysis (based on interviews and surveys) of women in the sciences from an early childhood interest, through university, to graduate school and finally into the academic workplace. The thesis of this book is that "women face a special series of gender related barriers to entry and success in scientific careers that persist, despite recent advances".&lt;ref name="etzkowitz" /&gt;

Computer scientist [[Karen Petrie]], from [[University of Dundee]], has developed an argument to illustrate why an attack on [[Sexism in the technology industry|sexism in computing]] is not an attack on men.&lt;ref name="petrie"&gt;{{citation|author=Petrie, Karen|title=Attack on sexism not an attack on men|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=27 November 2013|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/attack-on-sexism-not-an-attack-on-men-1-3209552}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ian Gent]], [[University of St Andrews]], has described this idea which is key to the argument as the "[[Petrie Multiplier]]".&lt;ref name="gent"&gt;{{citation|author=Gent, Ian|title=The Petrie Multiplier: Why an Attack on Sexism in Tech is NOT an Attack on Men|work=Ian Gent's Blog|date=13 October 2013|url=http://iangent.blogspot.co.uk/2013/10/the-petrie-multiplier-why-attack-on.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to J. McGrath Cohoon, senior research scientist for the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology, there are a few possible hypotheses for why women are underrepresented in computer sciences attributed to already established theories about the influence of gender and technology stereotypes. One gender related hypothesis is that women find it more difficult than men to contribute to the intellectual life of the field in the sense that reviewers of their work are unconsciously downgraded due to their status as women or those women have lower confidence in this field that inhibits women's willingness to publicly present their technical findings. Due to this barrier of women as second-class citizens in the computing world, it creates an environment that is not accessible to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 =  | year = 2011 | title = Gender And Computing Conference Papers | url = | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 54 | issue = 8| pages = 72–80 | doi=10.1145/1978542.1978561}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the Psychology of Women Quarterly backs this hypothesis up by concluding that even the enduring effect of single brief exposures to stereotypical role models leaves a strong mark. Their findings reported that the most important factor in recruiting women to the computer science field is that women meet with a potential role model, regardless of gender of that role model, that conveys to the woman a sense of belonging in the field. This finding suggests that support and encouragement are the two most important aspects that can influence women participation in computing. In order for women to be more receptive to the field is if the environment became a more welcoming place by their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheryan | first1 = Sapna | last2 = Drury | first2 = Benjamin J. | last3 = Vichayapai | first3 = Marissa | year = 2013 | title = Enduring Influence Of Stereotypical Computer Science Role Models on Women's Academic Aspirations | url = | journal = Psychology Of Women Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 72–79 | doi=10.1177/0361684312459328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cordelia Fine]] in her book [[Delusions of Gender]] argues that apparent differences are due to constant exposure to societal beliefs of gender difference. Fine also argues that "...while social effects on sex differences are well-established, spurious results, poor methodologies and untested assumptions mean we don't yet know whether, on average, males and females are born differently predisposed to systemizing versus empathising."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Forum {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-23/edition-12/forum|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-1/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Letters {{!}} The Psychologist|url = http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-24/edition-2/letters|website = thepsychologist.bps.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another argument for why women are less prevalent in computer science is the ill-defined nature of computing according to Paul De Palma. In his article Why Women Avoid Computer Science, he postulates that women find careers in computing unattractive. He finds that among the many reasons offered, he believes the nature of computing is what drives them away. He claims that young men who are drawn to computer science and engineering are those that like to tinker, those who like to use tools to create and dismantle objects. He further claims that computing is not a true profession, that traditional career paths such as law, business, and medicine are more certain and profitable on average than computing. He compares it to using a computer, computers nowadays do not come with lengthy manuals on the inner workings of the modern day computer, in fact our tools are always more complicated than their what they are used for, thus the tinkering nature of men, the drive born from gender stereotyping from birth, has made men successful in this field for they are more inclined to spend endless hours of tinkering with software and hardware. His claim revolves around the focus that boys and girls fall into gender stereotypes, girls who usually are given dolls and boys who are given trucks and toy tool boxes. He claims that these gender roles placed on children is one of the primary causes for the gender gap seen in computer science. He postulates that if we were to see more girls playing with trucks and other "boy-related" toys that perhaps we would see an increase in this tinkering nature and therefore more participation of women in the computer science field.&lt;ref&gt;De Palma, Paul.

The Hubble constant, named for [[astronomer]] [[Edwin Hubble]], whose work made clear the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], measures the rate at which expansion occurs. In accordance with the [[Copernican principle]] that the Earth is not in a central, specially favored position, one would expect that measuring this constant at any point in the universe would yield the same value. If, on the other hand, Earth were at or near the center of a very low-density region of [[interstellar space]] (a relative void), denser material in a shell around it would strongly&lt;!--is "strongly" necessary?--&gt; attract material away from the centerpoint. Thus, stars inside such a "Hubble bubble" would accelerate away from Earth much&lt;!--much?--&gt; faster than the general expansion of the universe.&lt;ref name = astronweb/&gt;&lt;ref name= moss/&gt; This situation would provide an alternative to [[dark energy]] in explaining the apparent [[accelerating universe]].&lt;ref name=moss/&gt;

==Hubble bubble proposed==
In 1998, Zehavi et al. reported evidence in support of a Hubble bubble.&lt;ref name=zehavi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zehavi|first=Idit|author2=Adam G Riess |author3=Robert P Kirshner |author4=Avishai Dekel |title=A Local Hubble Bubble from Type IA Supernovae?|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1998|volume=503|issue=2|page=483|doi=10.1086/306015|bibcode=1998ApJ...503..483Z|arxiv = astro-ph/9802252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial suggestion that local [[redshift]] velocities differ from those seen elsewhere in the universe was based on observations of [[Type 1a supernova]]e, often abbreviated "SNe Ia." Such stars have been used as [[standard candle]] distance markers for 20 years, and were key to the first observations of [[dark energy]].&lt;ref name=overbye&gt;{{cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|title=From the Clash of White Dwarfs, the Birth of a Supernova|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/23/science/space/23star.html?_r=1|accessdate=6 February 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zehavi ''et al.'' studied the peculiar velocites of 44 SNe Ia to test for a local void, and reported that Earth seemed to be inside a relative void of roughly 20% underdensity, surrounded by a dense shell, a "bubble".&lt;ref name=zehavi/&gt;

==Testing the hypothesis==

In 2007, Conley et al. examined the SNe Ia color data comparisons while taking into account the effect of cosmic dust in external galaxies. They concluded that the data did not support the existence of a local Hubble bubble.&lt;ref name=conley/&gt;

In 2010, Moss et al. analyzed the Hubble Bubble model although without using that name,&lt;ref name=astronweb/&gt; saying "The suggestion that we occupy a privileged position near the center of a large, nonlinear, and nearly spherical void has recently attracted much attention as an alternative to dark energy."&lt;ref name=moss&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moss|first=Adam|author2=James P Zibin |author3=Douglas Scott |title=Precision Cosmology Defeats Void Models for Acceleration|date=July 21, 2010|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.83.103515|journal=Physical Review D|volume=83|issue=10 |pages=103515|arxiv=1007.3725|bibcode = 2011PhRvD..83j3515M }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Looking not only at supernova data but also at the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background spectrum]], [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and other factors, they concluded that "voids are in severe tension with the data. In particular, void models predict a very low local Hubble rate, suffer from an "old age problem", and predict much less local structure than is observed."&lt;ref name = moss/&gt;

The '''IC2MP''' (Institute of Chemistry of Poitiers : Materials and Natural Resources) is a multidisciplinary research institute of the [[University of Poitiers]] ([[France]]) and the [[CNRS]].

== Présentation ==

The '''IC2MP''' is a research laboratory mainly in chemistry and geology. It was created on January 1, 2012, which fields of expertise include the study of materials (clay, catalysts,..), natural environments (waters, soils,..) and the reactions (natural or caused). The major application fields relate to catalysis, synthesis, decontamination, use of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.gecat.fr/spip.php?site5 Gecat official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IC2MP was born from the merger of four laboratories of Poitiers University (SFA and [[École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de Poitiers|ENSI Poitiers]])&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.univ-poitiers.fr/recherche/laboratoires/institut-de-chimie-des-milieux-et-des-materiaux-de-poitiers-ic2mp-umr-7285-9826.kjsp?RH=1328803971990], description of the laboratory, University of Poitiers&lt;/ref&gt; and CNRS&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.cnrs.fr/inc/laboratoires/dr8.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002050341/http://www.cnrs.fr/inc/laboratoires/dr8.php |archivedate=2013-10-02 |df= }}, description of IC2MP by CNRS&lt;/ref&gt; located on the university campus of Poitiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://carteau.onema.fr/contenu/actualites/hydrasa_et_lcme_poitiers_fusionnent_et_deviennent_ic2mp HYDRASA et LCME-Poitiers fusionnent et deviennent IC2MP] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120708064255/http://carteau.onema.fr/contenu/actualites/hydrasa_et_lcme_poitiers_fusionnent_et_deviennent_ic2mp |date=2012-07-08 }}, CARTEAU - Office national de l'eau et des milieux aquatiques&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute IC2MP includes five research teams:
* Water, organic geochemistry, health ;
* HydrASA - Hydrogeology, clay soils and alterations ; 
* SAMCat - From the active site to the catalysis material ;
* Calalysis and unconventional media ;
* Organic synthesis. 
The scientific team « Water, organic geochemistry, health », with the [[École nationale supérieure d'ingénieurs de Poitiers|ENSIP]] and the [http://apten.asso.univ-poitiers.fr APTEN], are the initiators of the ‘Water Information Day’ (the [[Journées Information Eaux]]), a bi-annual event which occurs around the opening of the academic year.

== Some research works ==

* In 2008, the discovery of more than 250 well-preserved fossils in Gabon brought, for the first time, the proof of the existence of pluricellular organisms which lived 2.1 billion years ago, a crucial advance in the understanding of the origin of life. So far, the first forms of complex life (with multiple cells) previously found were dated back 600 million years.  These works were published in 2010 in the magazine ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100630/full/news.2010.323.html Ancient macrofossils unearthed in West Africa], ''Nature'', June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This major and unexpected discovery, conducted by the team of Professor [[Abderrazak El Albani]] gave birth to a cross-disciplinary research project within the IC2MP Institute aiming at studying organic and primitive materials and Paleo-environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/1753.htm CNRS Article 30 June 2010 Discovery of a complex, multicellular life from over two billion years ago]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cancer: a new therapeutic molecule which attacks only the tumourous cells. In 2012, a study led by the researchers of the IC2MP, supported by the Cancéropôle Grand Ouest, resulted in the finalization of the therapeutic targeting  system, which is programmed to transport a powerful anti-cancer agent through the tumorous cells, without affecting the healthy tissue usually damaged by classical therapies. The validity of this concept was demonstrated on mouses, in the context of the treatment of a solid tumor. This study, which represents a new hope in the fight against cancer, has been published in the international edition of  [[Angewandte Chemie]] as a “Very Important Paper” (VIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.201204935 | volume=51 | title=The First Generation of β-Galactosidase-Responsive Prodrugs Designed for the Selective Treatment of Solid Tumors in Prodrug Monotherapy | year=2012 | journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition | pages=11606–11610 | last1 = Legigan | first1 = Thibaut}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was directed by Sébastien Papot, lecturer at University of Poitiers and leader of the Research Group “[http://smp.labo.univ-poitiers.fr/ Programmed Molecular Systems]”, part of the research team Organic Synthesis.

{{lowercase|title=iDrive}}

'''iDrive''' is a system used to control most secondary vehicle systems in many current [[BMW]] [[automobile|car]]s. iDrive had its world premiere in 2001, debuting with the new [[BMW 7 Series (E65)]]. iDrive unifies vehicle systems under a single control architecture for convenient use by the driver. The iDrive  [[Automobile controls|controls]] consists of a [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] panel mounted in the [[dashboard]] and a controller [[Control knob|knob]] mounted on the [[Center console (automobile)|center console]].

iDrive introduced the first [[Multiplexing|multiplexed]] [[MOST Bus]]/[[Byteflight]] [[optical fiber]] [[Bus (computing)|databusses]] with very high [[bit rate]] in a production vehicle. These are used for high-speed applications such as controlling the [[television]], [[DVD]], or driver assistance systems like [[adaptive cruise control]], [[automotive night vision|infrared night vision]] or [[automotive head-up display|head-up display]].

iDrive allows the [[driver (person)|driver]] and front-seat passenger (in some recent cars it is available to back-seat passengers as well) to control such amenities as the climate ([[air conditioner]] and heater), the audio system ([[radio]] and [[CD player]]), the [[navigation]] system and the [[communication]] system.

iDrive is also used in current [[Rolls-Royce Motors|Rolls-Royce]] models; as Rolls-Royce is owned by BMW.&lt;ref name=CarTourRRDHC&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHMyqE7akk4 2011 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé -- Car Tour], YouTube.com, July 24, 2011, Accessed August 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; BMW also owns the [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] brand, and a pared-down version of iDrive is sold on those cars, branded as Connected.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techradar.com/us/news/car-tech/mini-connected-everything-you-need-to-know-1085115&lt;/ref&gt;

==iDrive Generations==

===iDrive (1st Gen)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

An early prototype iDrive  (called the Intuitive Interaction Concept) was featured on the [[BMW Z9]] concept in 1999.
Series production version debuted in September 2001 with the [[BMW 7 Series (E65)]] and was based on Microsoft [[Windows CE]] for Automotive.&lt;br /&gt;
This can easily be seen when the system reboots or restarts after a software crash displaying a "Windows CE" logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
  | title = Microsoft Technology Hits the Road in BMW 7 Series
  | publisher = [[Microsoft]]
  | date=  2002-03-04
  | url = http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2002/mar02/03-04BMWpr.mspx
  | accessdate = 2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of iDrive controllers in the 7 Series was only equipped with the turn knob. The GPS computer (located in the trunk) was only capable of reading map CDs. ("NAV01")

In October 2003, a menu and a customizable button was added to the controller. The new GPS computer ("NAV02") was updated to DVD, featured a much faster processor and the ability to display the map in birdview ("perspective").

In April 2005, the iDrive controller was changed again, the turn knob having a new leather top. The last hardware update of the GPS unit ("NAV03") got a faster processor again. The map display is antialiased. The 8.8" wide-screen display was updated, having a brighter screen and the ability to control a MP3 capable 6 CD-changer or a BMW iPod Interface. Possible options include a TV tuner, DVD changer, BMW Night Vision, side view camera and a rear view camera.

The iDrive system on the 7 Series E65/E66/E67/E68 has no special name and may not be mistaken with the newer generations called CCC (Car Communications Computer) and CIC (Car Information Computer). (see below)
This fact becomes very important with after-market retrofits like multimedia and video interfaces, because the most of them are only compatible to the CCC system. But many manufactures list the "7 Series E65/E66/E67/E68 with CCC" in their compatibility charts although no 7 Series E65/E66/E67/E68 with CCC exist.

===iDrive Business (M-ASK)===
M-ASK stands for MMI Audio System controller and is manufactured by [[Harman International Industries#Automotive systems|Becker]]. This is a limited version of the iDrive computer with a small 6.6" display and is only found on 5, 6 and 7 Series, and the X5 or X6, without the navigation option.

In addition it can optionally be ordered in Europe on the 1 Series and 3 Series as "Business navigation", which has basic navigation abilities. Early versions of the Business navigation could only display directional arrows, but the latest version can also display 2D maps. iDrive Business Navigation uses a different map DVD than iDrive Professional Navigation. In addition, as only one optical drive is available, one cannot use both navigation and listen to a CD simultaneously.

When iDrive Professional is ordered the M-ASK system is replaced by either the CCC or CIC in addition to a larger display.

iDrive Business is available on the following cars;
* iDrive Business Navigation (optional)
** [[BMW 1 Series|1 Series E81/E82/E87/E88]]
** [[BMW E90|3 Series E90/E91/E92/E93]]
* iDrive Business (default when navigation is not ordered)
** [[BMW E60|5 Series E60/E61]]
** [[BMW E63/E64|6 Series E63/E64]]
** [[BMW E65/E66/E67/E68|7 Series E65/E66/E67/E68]]
** [[BMW F01|7 Series F01/F02]]
** [[BMW E70|X5 E70]]
** [[BMW E71|X6 E71]]

Note that the above list can vary depending on the region. For instance the North American 7 Series come by default with CCC or CIC.

===iDrive Professional Navigation (CCC)===
[[Image:Idrive-Controller.jpg|thumb|iDrive controller on a BMW 530d]]
It debuted in 2003 with the E60/E61 5 Series and is based on Wind River [[VxWorks]], a real-time operating system.&lt;ref name="BMWCCA"&gt;{{cite web

CCC stands for Car Communication Computer and uses a larger 8.8" wide-screen display. It was available on the following cars as an option;
* [[BMW 1 Series|1 Series E81/E82/E87/E88]] manufactured until March 2007
* [[BMW E90|3 Series E90/E91/E92/E93]] manufactured until March 2007
* [[BMW E60|5 Series E60/E61]] manufactured until March 2007
* [[BMW E63/E64|6 Series E63/E64]] manufactured until March 2007

CCC based systems use a map DVD from [[Navteq]] in a dedicated DVD drive.

====CCC - Update 1====

This is a minor update to iDrive Professional debuted in March 2007. It adds additional programmable buttons in the dashboard to directly access frequent functions and it removes the [[Haptic technology|haptic]] feedback from the iDrive controller. It is available on the following cars as an option;
* 1 Series E81/E82/E87/E88 manufactured between March 2007 and September 2008
* 3 Series E90/E91/E92/E93 manufactured between March 2007 and August 2008
* 5 Series E60/E61 manufactured between March 2007 and August 2008
* 6 Series E63/E64 manufactured between March 2007 and August 2008
* [[BMW E70|X5 E70]] manufactured until MY2010
* [[BMW E71|X6 E71]]

====CCC - Update 2====

This is a minor update debuted in September 2008 for Model Year 2009 cars equipped with iDrive Professional that did not get the new CIC based system. These cars get the new iDrive controller that is also used on cars with CIC. The actual iDrive computer (CCC) remains the same. This update is available on the following cars;
* 5 Series E60/E61 manufactured in September 2008 to February 2009 (to October 2008 for European production)
* 6 Series E63/E64 manufactured in September 2008 to February 2009 (to October 2008 for European production)

===iDrive Professional Navigation (CIC)===

It debuted in September 2008 with F01/F02 7 Series. CIC stands for Car Information Computer and is manufactured by [[Harman International Industries#Automotive systems|Becker]], utilizing the [[QNX]] operating system. It is available on the following cars as an option;
* 1 Series E81/E82/E87/E88 manufactured from September 2008
* 3 Series E90/E91/E92/E93 manufactured from September 2008
* 5 Series E60/E61 manufactured from March 2009 / Model Year 2010 (E60/61 manufactured from November 2008 in Europe)
* 5 Series F07/F10/F11 manufactured from September 2009
* 6 Series E63/E64 manufactured from March 2009 / Model Year 2010 (E63/64 manufactured from November 2008 in Europe)
* 7 Series F01/F02 manufactured from September 2008
* X1 E84 
* X3 F25 manufactured from November 2010
* X5 E70 manufactured from September 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BMW X5 and X6 to get the new iDrive System in September|url=http://bmw-carnews.blogspot.ca/2009/01/bmw-x5-and-x6-to-get-new-idrive-system.html|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIC system is a major update to iDrive, replacing the display, computer and the controller. The display is of a higher resolution, and is generally more responsive than CCC, to address one of the common complaints of iDrive. Internet access is also supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2007-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIC-based systems use maps from [[TeleAtlas]] that are installed on an internal 2.5" 80GB [[Hard Disk Drive]] (HDD). This HDD can also store up to 8GB of music files for playback. For facilitating the uploading of music files to the HDD, a [[USB]] port is provided in the glove box. Bluetooth music streaming available through a separate accessory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bmwstream2air.com|title=BMW Bluetooth adapter for iPod/iPhone interface port|last=|first=|date=|website=BMWstream2air|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following 2009 LCI production, all CIC-based iDrive systems support DVD video. This, however, is only operational when the vehicle is in the "Park" position for automatic transmissions, or while the parking brake is set for vehicles that have a manual transmission. DVD audio will continue to play while driving.

===iDrive Professional Navigation (CIC-HIGH)===

BMW introduced a further update to the iDrive Professional System in early 2012, calling it the "Next Big Thing" (NBT). It was introduced in current generation cars as an option, including:

* 1 Series F20
* 2 Series F22/F23
* 3 Series F30
* 4 Series F32/F33/F36
* 5 Series F10
* 6 Series F06/F12/F13
* 7 Series F01

The update includes extensive hardware and software changes including cosmetic enhancements, faster processor, more memory, detailed 3D maps and improved routing. In addition, the capacity of the internal HDD has been increased from 10GB to 20GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Rationale ==
The [[design rationale]] of iDrive is to replace an array of controls for the above systems with an all-in-one unit. The controls necessary for vehicle control and safety, such as the [[headlight]]s and [[turn signal]]s, are still located in the immediate vicinity of the steering column. Since, in the rationale of the designers, the [[air conditioning]], [[Vehicle audio|car audio]], [[navigation]] and [[communication]] controls are not used equally often, they have been moved into a central location.

== Controversy ==
iDrive caused significant controversy among users, the automotive media, and critics when it was first introduced.&lt;ref name="blog post regarding difficulties using iDrive"&gt;[http://themobileexperience.blogspot.com/2007/01/bmw-idrive-really-sucks.html blog post regarding difficulties using iDrive]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many reviewers of BMW vehicles in automobile magazines disapproved of the system. Criticisms of iDrive included its steep [[learning curve]] and its tendency to cause the driver to look away from the road too much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EFDA1E30F931A25756C0A9649C8B63 |title= Menus Behaving Badly |accessdate=January 18, 2008 |author=JAMES G.

A new iDrive system (CIC) was introduced in September 2008 to address most of the complaints. CIC-HIGH, introduced in 2012, brought further improvements.

== Overview ==

The ''iDrive'' M-ASK and CCC systems are based around the points of a compass (north, south, east, west) with each direction corresponding with a specific area. These areas are also colour-coded providing identification as to which part of the system is currently being viewed.

* North (blue) for communication
* East (green) for navigation (In some models without navigation, this option is replaced by the On Board Computer)
* South (brown) for entertainment
* West (red) for climate control

Also, at the iDrive home screen, the control knob can be pushed downwards to provide access to the car's control panel (iMenu), which gives access to a variety of operational parameters.

Starting in 2007, iDrive added programmable buttons (6 USA/Japan, 8 in Europe) to the dashboard, breaking tradition of having the entire system operated via the control knob. Each button can be programmed to instantly access any feature within iDrive (such as a particular navigation route, or one's favorite radio station). In addition, a dedicated AM/FM button, and a Mode button (to switch between entertainment sources) were added (only United States)

iDrive is controlled by manipulating the control knob. This can be pushed north, south, east, west, inwards (down) or rotated left and right.
The iDrive system includes a button marked "Menu" behind the control knob that provides quick access to the home screen.

iDrive is unique among its competitors by using a widescreen display that is split into a 2/3 main window, and 1/3 "Assistance Window". This allows the driver to use a function or menu, while simultaneously maintaining secondary information. For example, if the driver is not in the Navigation menu, he or she can still see a map on the assistance window. Other information that can be displayed includes navigation route directions and a trip computer.

== History &amp; background ==
Jirnexu was formerly known as Saving Plus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/cover-story-accidental-fintech-firm|title=Cover Story: The accidental fintech firm|date=2017-06-16|work=The Edge Markets|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, former Citi banker Yuen Tuck Siew, together with James Barnes founded RinggitPlus.com, a comparison and application website for financial products in Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asianentrepreneur.org/21863-2/|title=Yuen Tuck Siew, Co-Founder of Saving Plus - The Asian Entrepreneur|last=Ting|first=Henry|date=2015-12-23|work=The Asian Entrepreneur|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/technology/the-rise-and-rise-of-chatbots|title=The rise and rise of chatbots|last=Ramchandani|first=Nisha|work=The Business Times|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website was officially launched in 2013 to allow comparison of and application for credit cards, home loans, car loans, investments and insurance schemes.&lt;ref name="Khoo"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vulcanpost.com/243832/financial-comparison-websites-malaysia/|title=7 Financial Comparison Websites To Help You Make Wise Decisions In Malaysia|last=Khoo|first=Jean|date=2015-05-19|work=Vulcan Post|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themalaysianreserve.com/new/story/smart-money-siew-yuen-tuck|title=Smart Money on Siew Yuen Tuck {{!}} The Malaysian Reserve|website=themalaysianreserve.com|access-date=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''leaf''' is an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] of a [[vascular plant]] and is the principal lateral appendage of the [[plant stem|stem]].{{sfn|Esau|2006}} The leaves and stem together form the [[shoot]].{{sfn|Cutter|1969}} Leaves are collectively referred to as '''foliage,''' as in "autumn foliage".{{sfn|Haupt|1953}}{{sfn|Mauseth|2009}}

A leaf is a thin, [[dorsiventral|dorsiventrally flattened]] [[organ (biology)|organ]], usually borne above ground and specialized for [[photosynthesis]]. In most leaves, the primary [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] tissue, the [[palisade mesophyll]], is located on the upper side of the blade or lamina of the leaf{{sfn|Esau|2006}} but in some species, including the mature foliage of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'',{{sfn|James et al|1999}} palisade mesophyll is present on both sides and the leaves are said to be isobilateral. Most leaves have distinct upper surface (''{{vanchor|adaxial}}'') and lower surface (''{{vanchor|abaxial}}'') that differ in colour, hairiness, the number of [[stomata]] (pores that intake and output gases), the amount and structure of [[epicuticular wax]] and other features.

Leaves can have many different shapes, sizes and textures. The broad, flat leaves with complex [[Venation (botany)|venation]] of [[flowering plants]] are known as ''megaphylls'' and the species that bear them, the majority, as broad-leaved or megaphyllous plants. In the [[clubmosses]], with different evolutionary origins, the leaves are simple (with only a single vein) and are known as microphylls.{{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}} Some leaves, such as [[bulb]] scales, are not above ground. In many aquatic species the leaves are submerged in water. Succulent plants often have thick juicy leaves, but some leaves are without major photosynthetic function and may be dead at maturity, as in some [[cataphyll]]s and [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]]. Furthermore, several kinds of leaf-like structures found in vascular plants are not totally homologous with them. Examples include flattened plant stems called [[phylloclade]]s and [[wikt:cladode|cladodes]], and flattened leaf stems called [[Petiole (botany)|phyllodes]] which differ from leaves both in their structure and origin.{{sfn|Mauseth|2009}}{{sfn|Cooney-Sovetts|Sattler|1987}} Many structures of non-vascular plants, such as the [[Glossary of botanical terms#phyllid|phyllids]] of [[mosses]] and [[liverworts]] and even of some [[foliose lichen]]s, which are not [[plant]]s at all (in the sense of being members of the kingdom [[Plant]]ae), look and function much like leaves.

==General characteristics==
[[File:3D rendering of a micro CT scan of a piece of dried leaf..ogv|thumb|3D rendering of a [[computed tomography]] scan of a leaf ]]
Leaves are the most important organs of most vascular plants.{{sfn|Tsukaya|2013}} Green plants are [[autotrophic]], meaning that they do not obtain food from other living things but instead create their own by [[photosynthesis]]. They capture the energy in sun[[light]] and use it to make simple [[sugars]], such as [[glucose]] and [[sucrose]], from [[carbon dioxide]] and water. The sugars are then stored as [[starch]], further processed by [[chemical synthesis]] into more complex organic molecules such as [[Protein|proteins]] or [[cellulose]], the basic structural material in plant cell walls, or [[Metabolism|metabolised]] by [[cellular respiration]] to provide chemical energy to run cellular processes. The leaves draw water from the ground in the [[transpiration stream]] through a [[Vascular tissue|vascular conducting system]] known as [[xylem]] and obtain carbon dioxide from the [[atmosphere]] by diffusion through openings called [[stomata]] in the outer covering layer of the leaf ([[Epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]), while leaves are orientated to maximise their exposure to sunlight. Once sugar has been synthesized, it needs to be transported to areas of active growth such as the [[plant shoots]] and [[Root|roots]]. Vascular plants transport sucrose in a special tissue called the [[phloem]]. The phloem and xylem are parallel to each other but the transport of materials is usually in opposite directions. Within the leaf these vascular systems branch (ramify) to form veins which supply as much of the leaf as possible, ensuring that [[cells]] carrying out photosynthesis are close to the transportation system.{{sfn|Feugier|2006}}

Typically leaves are broad, flat and thin (dorsiventrally flattened), thereby maximising the surface area directly exposed to light and enabling the light to penetrate the [[Plant cell#Types of plant cells and tissues|tissues]] and reach the [[chloroplast]]s, thus promoting photosynthesis. They are arranged on the plant so as to expose their surfaces to light as efficiently as possible without shading each other, but there are many exceptions and complications. For instance plants adapted to windy conditions may have [[pendent]] leaves, such as in many [[willow]]s and [[eucalypts]]s. The flat, or laminar, shape also maximises [[thermal conduction|thermal]] contact with the surrounding [[air]], promoting cooling. Functionally, in addition to carrying out photosynthesis, the leaf is the principal site of [[transpiration]], providing the energy required to draw the transpiration stream up from the roots, and [[guttation]].

Many gymnosperms have thin needle-like or scale-like leaves that can be advantageous in cold climates with frequent snow and frost.{{sfn|Purcell|2016}} These are interpreted as reduced from megaphyllous leaves of their [[Devonian]] ancestors.{{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}} Some leaf forms are adapted to modulate the amount of light they absorb to avoid or mitigate excessive heat, [[ultraviolet]] damage, or desiccation, or to sacrifice light-absorption efficiency in favour of protection from herbivory. For [[xerophyte]]s the major constraint is not light [[Radiant flux|flux]] or [[irradiance|intensity]], but drought.{{sfn|Willert et al|1992}} Some [[leaf window|window plants]] such as ''[[Fenestraria]]'' species and some ''[[Haworthia]]'' species such as ''Haworthia tesselata'' and ''[[Haworthia truncata]]'' are examples of xerophytes.{{sfn|Bayer|1982}} and ''[[Bulbine]] mesembryanthemoides''.{{sfn|Marloth|1913–1932}}

Leaves also function to store chemical [[energy]] and water (especially in [[succulents]]) and may become specialised organs serving other functions, such as tendrils of [[pea]]s and other legumes, the protective spines of cacti and the insect traps in carnivorous plants such as ''[[Nepenthes]]'' and ''Sarracenia''.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;356}} Leaves are the fundamental structural units from which cones are constructed in gymnosperms (each cone scale is a modified megaphyll leaf known as a sporophyll){{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}}{{rp|408}}  and from which flowers are constructed in [[flowering plant]]s.{{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}}{{rp|445}}
[[File:Vein skeleton of a leaf (de-ghosted).jpg|thumb|Vein skeleton of a leaf. Veins contain lignin that make them harder to degrade for microorganisms.]]

The internal organisation of most kinds of leaves has evolved to maximise exposure of the photosynthetic [[organelles]], the [[chloroplast]]s, to [[light]] and to increase the absorption of [[carbon dioxide]] while at the same time controlling water loss. Their surfaces are waterproofed by the [[plant cuticle]] and gas exchange between the mesophyll cells and the atmosphere is controlled by minute (length and width measured in tens of µm) openings called [[stomata]] which open or close to regulate the rate exchange of carbon dioxide, [[oxygen]], and [[water vapour]] into and out of the internal intercellular space system. Stomatal opening is controlled by the [[turgor pressure]] in a pair of [[guard cell]]s that surround the stomatal aperture. In any square centimeter of a plant leaf there may be from 1,000 to 100,000 stomata.{{sfn|Krogh|2010}}

[[File:Eucalyptus foliage isobilateral dorsiventral IMG 0588e.JPG|thumb|Near the ground these ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' saplings have juvenile dorsiventral foliage from the previous year, but this season their newly sprouting foliage is isobilateral, like the mature foliage on the adult trees above]]
The shape and structure of leaves vary considerably from species to species of plant, depending largely on their adaptation to climate and available light, but also to other factors such as grazing animals (such as deer), available nutrients, and ecological competition from other plants. Considerable changes in leaf type occur within species too, for example as a plant matures; as a case in point ''Eucalyptus'' species commonly have [[Bilateral symmetry|isobilateral]], pendent leaves when mature and dominating their neighbours; however, such trees tend to have erect or horizontal [[dorsiventral]] leaves as seedlings, when their growth is limited by the available light.{{sfn|James |Bell|2000}} Other factors include the need to balance water loss at high temperature and low humidity against the need to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide. In most plants leaves also are the primary organs responsible for [[transpiration]] and [[guttation]] (beads of fluid forming at leaf margins).

Leaves can also store [[food]] and [[water]], and are modified accordingly to meet these functions, for example in the leaves of succulent plants and in [[bulb]] scales. The concentration of photosynthetic structures in leaves requires that they be richer in [[protein]], [[minerals]], and [[sugars]] than, say, woody stem tissues. Accordingly, leaves are prominent in the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] of many [[animal]]s.

[[File:Eenbruinigherfstblad.jpg|thumb|A leaf shed in [[autumn]].]]
Correspondingly, leaves represent heavy investment on the part of the plants bearing them, and their retention or disposition are the subject of elaborate strategies for dealing with pest pressures, seasonal conditions, and protective measures such as the growth of thorns and the production of [[phytolith]]s, [[lignin]]s, [[tannin]]s and [[poison]]s.

[[Deciduous#Botany|Deciduous]] plants in frigid or cold temperate regions typically shed their leaves in autumn, whereas in areas with a severe dry season, some plants may shed their leaves until the dry season ends. In either case the shed leaves may be expected to contribute their retained nutrients to the soil where they fall.

In contrast, many other non-seasonal plants, such as palms and conifers, retain their leaves for long periods; ''[[Welwitschia]]'' retains its two main leaves throughout a lifetime that may exceed a thousand years.

The leaf-like organs of [[Bryophyte]]s (e.g., [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverworts]]), known as [[Glossary of botanical terms#phyllid|phyllids]], differ morphologically from the leaves of vascular plants in that they lack vascular tissue, are usually only a single cell thick and have no [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] stomata or internal system of intercellular spaces.

Simple, vascularised leaves ([[microphylls]])  first evolved as enations, extensions of the stem, in clubmosses such as ''[[Baragwanathia]]'' during the [[Silurian period]]. True leaves or euphylls of larger size and with more complex venation did not become widespread in other groups until the [[Devonian period]], by which time the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere had dropped significantly. This occurred independently in several separate lineages of vascular plants, in [[progymnosperm]]s like ''[[Archaeopteris]]'', in [[Sphenopsida]], [[fern]]s and later in the  [[gymnosperms]] and [[angiosperm]]s.  Euphylls are also referred to as [[Microphyll|macrophylls]] or megaphylls (large leaves).{{sfn|Stewart|Rothwell|1993}}

== {{vanchor|Morphology (large-scale features)}} ==
{{see also|Glossary of leaf morphology}}
A structurally complete leaf of an [[angiosperm]] consists of a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] (leaf stalk), a lamina (leaf blade), and [[stipule]]s (small structures located to either side of the base of the petiole). Not every species produces leaves with all of these structural components. Stipules may be conspicuous (e.g. [[beans]] and [[roses]]), soon falling or otherwise not obvious as in [[Moraceae]] or absent altogether as in the [[Magnoliaceae]]. A petiole may be absent, or the blade may not be laminar (flattened). The tremendous variety shown in leaf structure (anatomy) from species to species is presented in detail below under [[#Morphology|morphology]]. The petiole mechanically links the leaf to the plant and provides the route for transfer of water and sugars to and from the leaf. The lamina is typically the location of the majority of photosynthesis. The upper ([[Glossary of botanical terms#A|adaxial]]) angle between a leaf and a stem is known as the axil of the leaf. It is often the location of a [[bud]]. Structures located there are called "axillary".

[[File:Citrus leaf(crop).jpg|thumb|150px|Translucent glands in ''[[Citrus]]'' leaves{{sfn|Heywood et al|2007}}]]
External leaf characteristics, such as shape, margin, hairs, the petiole, and the presence of stipules and glands, are frequently important for identifying plants to family, genus or [[species]] levels, and botanists have developed a rich [[terminology]] for describing leaf characteristics. Leaves almost always have determinate growth. They grow to a specific pattern and shape and then stop. Other plant parts like stems or roots have non-determinate growth, and will usually continue to grow as long as they have the resources to do so.

The type of leaf is usually characteristic of a species (monomorphic), although some species produce more than one type of leaf (dimorphic or [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]]). The longest leaves are those of the [[Raffia palm]], ''R. regalis'' which may be up to {{convert|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide.{{sfn|Hallé|1977}} The terminology associated with the description of leaf morphology is presented, in illustrated form, at [http://wikibooks.org/wiki/Botany/Leaves_(forms) Wikibooks].

[[File:Crossyne guttata IMG 2410c.jpg|thumb|150px|Prostrate leaves in ''[[Crossyne guttata]]'']]
Where leaves are basal, and lie on the ground, they are referred to as [[Glossary of plant morphology#prostrate|prostrate]].

===Basic leaf types===
{{anchor|Basic leaf types}}
[[File:Fichtennadel (crop).jpg|thumb|150px|Leaves of the White Spruce (''[[Picea glauca]]'') are needle-shaped and their arrangement is spiral]]
* [[Fern]]s have [[fronds]]
* [[Conifer]] leaves are typically needle- or awl-shaped or scale-like
* [[Angiosperm]] (flowering plant) leaves: the standard form includes [[stipules]], a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]], and a [[glossary of botanical terms#lamina|lamina]]
* [[Lycopodiophyta|Lycophytes]] have [[microphyll]] leaves.
* [[Monocotyledon|Sheath]] leaves (type found in most [[Poaceae|grasses]] and many other monocots)
* Other specialized leaves (such as those of ''[[Nepenthes]]'', a pitcher plant)

===Arrangement on the stem===
{{main article|Phyllotaxis}}
Different terms are usually used to describe the arrangement of leaves on the stem ([[phyllotaxis]]):
[[File:Leaves opposite.jpg|thumb|150px|The leaves on this plant are arranged in pairs [[opposite leaves|opposite]] one another, with successive pairs at right angles to each other (''decussate'') along the red stem. Note the developing buds in the axils of these leaves.]]
;Alternate: One leaf, branch, or flower part attaches at each point or node on the stem, and leaves alternate direction, to a greater or lesser degree, along the stem.
;Basal: Arising from the base of the stem.
;Cauline: Arising from the aerial stem.
;Opposite: Two leaves, branches, or flower parts attach at each point or node on the stem. Leaf attachments are paired at each node and [[decussate]] if, as typical, each successive pair is rotated 90° progressing along the stem.
;Whorled, or verticillate: Three or more leaves, branches, or flower parts attach at each point or node on the stem. As with opposite leaves, successive whorls may or may not be decussate, rotated by half the angle between the leaves in the whorl (i.e., successive whorls of three rotated 60°, whorls of four rotated 45°, etc.). Opposite leaves may appear whorled near the tip of the stem. '''Pseudoverticillate''' describes an arrangement only appearing whorled, but not actually so.
;Rosulate: Leaves form a [[rosette (botany)|rosette]].
;Rows: The term, ''distichous'', literally means ''two rows''. Leaves in this arrangement may be alternate or opposite in their attachment. The term, ''2-ranked'', is equivalent. The terms, ''tristichous'' and ''tetrastichous'', are sometimes encountered. For example, the "leaves" (actually [[microphyll]]s) of most species of ''[[Selaginella]]'' are tetrastichous, but not decussate.

As a ''stem'' grows, leaves tend to appear arranged around the stem in a way that optimizes yield of light. In essence, leaves form a [[helix]] pattern centered around the stem, either [[clockwise and counterclockwise|clockwise or counterclockwise]], with (depending upon the species) the same angle of divergence. There is a regularity in these angles and they follow the numbers in a [[Fibonacci sequence]]: 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, 13/21, 21/34, 34/55, 55/89. This series tends to the [[golden angle]], which is approximately 360° × 34/89 ≈ 137.52° ≈ 137°&amp;nbsp;30′. In the series, the [[numerator]] indicates the number of complete turns or "gyres" until a leaf arrives at the initial position and the denominator indicates the number of leaves in the arrangement. This can be demonstrated by the following:
* Alternate leaves have an angle of 180° (or 1/2)
* 120° (or 1/3): 3 leaves in 1 circle
* 144° (or 2/5): 5 leaves in 2 gyres
* 135° (or 3/8): 8 leaves in 3 gyres.

===Divisions of the blade===
{{anchor|Divisions of the lamina (blade)}}
[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|thumb|150px|A leaf with laminar structure and [[pinnate]] venation]]
Two basic forms of leaves can be described considering the way the blade (lamina) is divided. A '''simple leaf''' has an undivided blade. However, the leaf may be ''dissected'' to form lobes, but the gaps between lobes do not reach to the main vein. A '''compound leaf''' has a fully subdivided blade, each [[leaflet (botany)|leaflet]] of the blade being separated along a main or secondary vein. The leaflets may have petiolules and stipels, the equivalents of the petioles and stipules of leaves. Because each leaflet can appear to be a simple leaf, it is important to recognize where the petiole occurs to identify a compound leaf. Compound leaves are a characteristic of some families of higher plants, such as the [[Fabaceae]]. The middle vein of a compound leaf or a [[frond]], when it is present, is called a [[rachis]].
;Palmately compound: Leaves have the leaflets radiating from the end of the petiole, like fingers of the palm of a hand; e.g., ''[[Cannabis]]'' (hemp) and ''[[Aesculus]]'' (buckeyes).
;Pinnately compound: Leaves have the leaflets arranged along the main or mid-vein.{{glossary}}
{{term|Odd pinnate}}{{defn|With a terminal leaflet; e.g., ''[[ash tree|Fraxinus]]'' (ash).}}
{{term|Even pinnate}}{{defn|Lacking a terminal leaflet; e.g., ''[[Swietenia]]'' (mahogany). A specific type of even pinnate is bipinnate, where leaves only consist of two leaflets; e.g. ''[[Hymenaea]]''.}}{{glossary end}}
;Bipinnately compound: Leaves are twice divided: the leaflets are arranged along a secondary vein that is one of several branching off the rachis. Each leaflet is called a ''pinnule''. The group of pinnules on each secondary vein forms a ''pinna''; e.g., ''[[Albizia]]'' (silk tree).
;Trifoliate (or trifoliolate): A pinnate leaf with just three leaflets; e.g., ''[[clover|Trifolium]]'' (clover), ''[[Laburnum]]'' (laburnum).
;Pinnatifid: Pinnately dissected to the central vein, but with the leaflets not entirely separate; e.g., ''[[Polypodium]]'', some ''[[Sorbus]]'' (whitebeams). In pinnately veined leaves the central vein in known as the ''midrib''.

===Characteristics of the petiole===
[[File:Rabarber stelen.jpg|thumb|150px|The overgrown petioles of [[rhubarb]] (''Rheum rhabarbarum'') are edible.]]
Petiolated leaves have a [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] (leaf stalk), and are said to be petiolate.

[[Sessility (botany)|Sessile]] (epetiolate) leaves have no petiole and the blade attaches directly to the stem. Subpetiolate leaves are nearly petiolate or have an extremely short petiole and may appear to be sessile.

In '''clasping''' or [[decurrent]] leaves, the blade partially surrounds the stem.

When the leaf base completely surrounds the stem, the leaves are said to be '''perfoliate''', such as in ''[[Eupatorium perfoliatum]]''.

In peltate leaves, the petiole attaches to the blade inside the blade margin.

In some ''[[Acacia]]'' species, such as the koa tree (''[[Acacia koa]]''), the petioles are expanded or broadened and function like leaf blades; these are called [[phyllode]]s. There may or may not be normal pinnate leaves at the tip of the phyllode.

A [[stipule]], present on the leaves of many [[dicotyledon]]s, is an appendage on each side at the base of the petiole, resembling a small leaf. Stipules may be lasting and not be shed (a stipulate leaf, such as in [[rose]]s and [[bean]]s), or be shed as the leaf expands, leaving a stipule scar on the twig (an exstipulate leaf).
The situation, arrangement, and structure of the stipules is called the "stipulation".
;Free, lateral: As in ''[[Hibiscus]]''.
;Adnate: Fused to the petiole base, as in ''[[Rose|Rosa]]''.
;Ochreate: Provided with [[ochrea]], or sheath-formed stipules, as in [[Polygonaceae]]; e.g., [[rhubarb]].
;Encircling the petiole base:{{glossary}}{{term|[[wikt:interpetiolar stipule|Interpetiolar]]}}{{defn|Between the petioles of two opposite leaves, as in [[Rubiaceae]].}}{{term|[[wikt:intrapetiolar stipule|Intrapetiolar]]}}{{defn|Between the petiole and the subtending stem, as in [[Malpighiaceae]].}}

===Veins===
{{see also|#Venation|#Vascular tissue}}
[[File:Taro leaf underside, backlit by sun.jpg|thumb|150px|Branching veins on underside of [[taro]] leaf]]
[[File:Tilia x cordata flower veination.JPG|thumb|150px|The venation within the bract of a [[lime tree]]]]
[[File:Leaf Skeleton negative (like photogram).jpg|150px|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of a leaf skeleton]]
Veins (sometimes referred to as nerves) constitute one of the more visible leaf traits or characteristics. The veins in a leaf represent the vascular structure of the organ, extending into the leaf via the [[petiole (botany)|petiole]] and provide transportation of water and nutrients between leaf and stem, and play a crucial role in the maintenance of leaf water status and photosynthetic capacity.They also play a role in the mechanical support of the leaf.{{sfn|Rolland-Lagan et al|2009}}{{sfn|Walls|2011}} Within the lamina of the leaf, while some vascular plants possess only a single vein, in most this vasculature generally divides (ramifies) according to a variety of patterns (venation) and form cylindrical bundles, usually lying in the median plane of the [[#Mesophyll|mesophyll]], between the two layers of [[#Epidermis|epidermis]].{{sfn|Dickison|2000}} This pattern is often specific to taxa, and of which angiosperms possess two main types, [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] and [[reticulate]] (net like). In general, parallel venation is typical of monocots, while reticulate is more typical of [[eudicots]] and [[magnoliids]] ("[[dicots]]"), though there are many exceptions.{{sfn|Rudall|2007}}{{sfn|Dickison|2000}}&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt;

The vein or veins entering the leaf from the petiole are called primary or first order veins. The veins branching from these are secondary or second order veins. These primary and secondary veins are considered major veins or lower order veins, though some authors include third order.{{sfn|Sack|Scoffoni|2013}} Each subsequent branching is sequentially numbered, and these are the higher order veins, each branching being associated with a narrower vein diameter.{{sfn|Roth-Nebelsick et al|2001}} In parallel veined leaves, the primary veins run parallel and equidistant to each other for most of the length of the leaf and then converge or fuse (anastomose) towards the apex. Usually many smaller minor veins interconnect these primary veins, but may terminate with very fine vein endings in the mesophyll. Minor veins are more typical of angiosperms, which may have as many as four higher orders.{{sfn|Sack|Scoffoni|2013}} In contrast, leaves with reticulate venation there is a single (sometimes more) primary vein in the centre of the leaf, referred to as the midrib or costa and is continuous with the vasculature of the petiole more proximally. The midrib then branches to a number of smaller secondary veins, also known as second order veins, that extend toward the leaf margins. These often terminate in a [[hydathode]], a secretory organ, at the margin. In turn, smaller veins branch from the secondary veins, known as tertiary or third order (or higher order) veins, forming  a dense reticulate pattern. The areas or islands of mesophyll lying between the higher order veins, are called [[wikt:areola|areoles]]. Some of the smallest veins (veinlets) may have their endings in the areoles, a process known as areolation.{{sfn|Roth-Nebelsick et al|2001}} These minor veins act as the sites of exchange between the mesophyll and the plant's vascular system.{{sfn|Walls|2011}} Thus minor veins collect the products of photosynthesis (photosynthate) from the cells where it takes place, while major veins are responsible for its transport outside of the leaf. At the same time water is being transported in the opposite direction.{{sfn|Ueno et al|2006}}{{sfn|Rudall|2007}}{{sfn|Dickison|2000}}

The number of vein endings is very variable, as is whether second order veins end at the margin, or link back to other veins.&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; There are many elaborate variations on the patterns that the leaf veins form, and these have functional implications. Of these, angiosperms have the greatest diversity.{{sfn|Sack|Scoffoni|2013}} Within these the major veins function as the support and distribution network for leaves and are correlated with leaf shape. For instance the parallel venation found in most monocots correlates with their  elongated leaf shape and wide leaf base, while reticulate venation is seen in simple entire leaves, while  digitate leaves typically have venation in which three or more primary veins diverge radially from a single point.{{sfn|Runions et al|2005}}{{sfn|Walls|2011}}{{sfn|Roth-Nebelsick et al|2001}}&lt;ref name=MMsvt/&gt;

In evolutionary terms, early emerging taxa tend to have [[dichotomous]] branching with reticulate systems emerging later. Veins appeared in the [[Permian]] period (299–252&amp;nbsp;mya), prior to the appearance of angiosperms in the [[Triassic]] (252–201&amp;nbsp;mya), during which vein hierarchy appeared enabling higher function, larger leaf size and adaption to a wider vaiety of climatic conditions.{{sfn|Sack|Scoffoni|2013}} Although it is the more complex pattern, branching veins appear to be [[plesiomorph]]ic and in some form were present in ancient [[seed plant]]s as long as 250 million years ago. A pseudo-reticulate venation that is actually a highly modified penniparallel one is an [[autapomorph]]y of some [[Melanthiaceae]], which are monocots; e.g., ''[[Paris quadrifolia]]'' (True-lover's Knot). In leaves with reticulate venation, veins form a scaffolding matrix imparting mechanical rigidity to leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.1141.57|title = Insights from the Plant World: A Fractal Analysis Approach to Tune Mechanical Rigidity of Scaffolding Matrix in Thin Films| journal=Advanced Materials Research| volume=1141| pages=57–64|year = 2016|last1 = Bagchi|first1 = Debjani| last2=Dasgupta| first2=Avik| last3=Gondaliya| first3=Amit D.| last4=Rajput| first4=Kishore S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphology changes within a single plant===

;Heteroblasty: Characteristic in which a plant has marked changes in leaf size, shape, and growth habit between juvenile and adult stages.

==Anatomy (medium and small scale)==

===Medium-scale features===

Leaves are normally extensively vascularised and typically have networks of [[vascular bundles]] containing [[xylem]], which supplies water for [[photosynthesis]], and [[phloem]], which transports the sugars produced by photosynthesis. Many leaves are covered in [[trichome]]s (small hairs) which have diverse  structures and functions.
[[File:Leaf Structure.svg|center|600px|Medium scale diagram of leaf internal anatomy]]

===Small-scale features===

The major tissue systems present are
* The '''[[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]''', which covers the upper and lower surfaces
* The '''[[leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll tissue]]''' inside the leaf, which is rich in chloroplasts (also called '''chlorenchyma''')
* The arrangement of '''veins''' (the [[vascular tissue]])

These three tissue systems typically form a regular organisation at the cellular scale. Specialised cells that differ markedly from surrounding cells, and which often synthesise specialised products such as crystals, are termed '''idioblasts'''.{{sfn|Cote|2009}}

====Epidermis====
[[File:Leaf epidermis w scale.jpg|thumb|[[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] image of the leaf epidermis of ''[[Nicotiana alata]]'', showing [[trichome]]s (hair-like appendages) and [[stoma]]ta (eye-shaped slits, visible at full resolution).]]
The [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] is the outer layer of [[cell (biology)|cells]] covering the leaf. It is covered with a waxy [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] which is impermeable to liquid water and water vapor and forms the boundary separating the plant's inner cells from the external world. The cuticle is in some cases thinner on the lower epidermis than on the upper epidermis, and is generally thicker on leaves from dry climates as compared with those from wet climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 3220956|title = The Relation of Leaf Structure to Physical Factors|journal = Transactions of the American Microscopical Society|volume = 26|pages = 19–98|last1 = Clements|first1 = Edith Schwartz|year = 1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; The epidermis serves several functions: protection against water loss by way of [[transpiration]], regulation of gas exchange and secretion of [[secondary metabolite|metabolic]] compounds. Most leaves show dorsoventral anatomy: The upper (adaxial) and lower (abaxial) surfaces have somewhat different construction and may serve different functions.

The epidermis tissue includes several differentiated cell types; epidermal cells, epidermal hair cells ([[trichome]]s), cells in the stomatal complex; guard cells and subsidiary cells. The epidermal cells are the most numerous, largest, and least specialized and form the majority of the epidermis. They are typically more elongated in the leaves of [[monocot]]s than in those of [[dicot]]s.

Chloroplasts are generally absent in epidermal cells, the exception being the guard cells of the [[stomata]]. The stomatal pores perforate the epidermis and are surrounded on each side by chloroplast-containing guard cells, and two to four subsidiary cells that lack chloroplasts, forming a specialized cell group known as the stomatal complex. The opening and closing of the stomatal aperture is controlled by the stomatal complex and regulates the exchange of gases and water vapor between the outside air and the interior of the leaf. Stomata therefore play the important role in allowing photosynthesis without letting the leaf dry out. In a typical leaf, the stomata are more numerous over the abaxial (lower) epidermis than the adaxial (upper) epidermis and are more numerous in plants from cooler climates.

====Mesophyll====
{{for|the term ''Mesophyll'' in the size classification of leaves|Leaf size}}
Most of the interior of the leaf between the upper and lower layers of epidermis is a ''[[parenchyma]]'' (ground tissue)  or ''[[chlorenchyma]]'' tissue called the '''mesophyll''' (Greek for "middle leaf"). This [[assimilation (biology)|assimilation]] tissue is the primary location of photosynthesis in the plant. The products of photosynthesis are called "assimilates".

In ferns and most flowering plants, the mesophyll is divided into two layers:
* An upper '''[[palisade cell|palisade layer]]''' of vertically elongated cells, one to two cells thick, directly beneath the adaxial epidermis, with intercellular air spaces between them. Its cells contain many more chloroplasts than the spongy layer. These long cylindrical cells are regularly arranged in one to five rows. Cylindrical cells, with the ''[[chloroplasts]]'' close to the walls of the cell, can take optimal advantage of light. The slight separation of the cells provides maximum [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] of carbon dioxide. Sun leaves have a multi-layered palisade layer, while shade leaves or older leaves closer to the soil are single-layered.
* Beneath the palisade layer is the '''spongy layer'''. The cells of the spongy layer are more branched and not so tightly packed, so that there are large intercellular air spaces between them for oxygen and carbon dioxide to diffuse in and out of during respiration and photosynthesis. These cells contain fewer chloroplasts than those of the palisade layer. The pores or ''stomata'' of the epidermis open into substomatal chambers, which are connected to the intercellular air spaces between the spongy and palisade mesophyll cells.

Leaves are normally [[green]], due to [[chlorophyll]] in [[chloroplast]]s in the mesophyll cells.  Plants that lack chlorophyll cannot [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]].

====Vascular tissue====
[[File:BrambleLeaf CrossPolarisedLight Diagram.jpg|thumb|The veins of a [[bramble]] leaf]]
The '''veins''' are the [[vascular tissue]] of the leaf and are located in the spongy layer of the mesophyll. The pattern of the veins is called [[#Venation (arrangement of the veins)|venation]]. In [[angiosperms]] the venation is typically parallel in [[monocotyledons]] and forms an interconnecting network in [[dicotyledon|broad-leaved plants]]. They were once thought to be typical examples of [[pattern formation]] through [[ramification (botany)|ramification]], but they may instead exemplify a pattern formed in a stress [[tensor field]].{{sfn|Couder et al|2002}}{{sfn|Corson et al|2009}}{{sfn|Laguna et al|2008}}

A vein is made up of a [[vascular bundle]]. At the core of each bundle are clusters of two
distinct types of conducting cells:
; [[Xylem]]: Cells that bring water and minerals from the roots into the leaf.
; [[Phloem]]: Cells that usually move [[sap]], with dissolved [[sucrose]]([[glucose]] to sucrose) produced by photosynthesis in the leaf, out of the leaf.

The xylem typically lies on the adaxial side of the vascular bundle and the phloem typically lies on the abaxial side. Both are embedded in a dense parenchyma tissue, called the sheath, which usually includes some structural collenchyma tissue.

==Leaf development==

According to [[Agnes Arber]]'s partial-shoot theory of the leaf, leaves are partial shoots,{{sfn|Arber|1950}} being derived from leaf [[primordia]] of the shoot apex.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;356}} Compound leaves are closer to shoots than simple leaves. Developmental studies have shown that compound leaves, like shoots, may branch in three dimensions.{{sfn|Rutishauser|Sattler|1997}}{{sfn|Lacroix et al|2003}} On the basis of molecular genetics, Eckardt and Baum (2010) concluded that "it is now generally accepted that compound leaves express both leaf and shoot properties."{{sfn|Eckardt|Baum|2010}}

== Ecology ==

=== Biomechanics ===
Plants respond and adapt to environmental factors, such as light and mechanical stress from wind. Leaves need to support their own mass and align themselves in such a way as to optimise their exposure to the sun, generally more or less horizontally. However horizontal alignment maximises exposure to bending forces and failure from stresses such as wind, snow, hail, falling debris, animals, and abrasion from surrounding foliage and plant structures. Overall leaves are relatively flimsy with regard to other plant structures such as stems, branches and roots.{{sfn|Read|Stokes|2006}}

Both leaf blade and petiole structure influence the leaf's response to forces such as wind, allowing a degree of repositioning to minimise [[drag (physics)|drag]] and damage, as opposed to resistance. Leaf movement like this may also increase [[turbulence]] of the air close to the surface of the leaf, which thins the [[boundary layer]] of air immediately adjacent to the surface, increasing the capacity for gas and heat exchange, as well as photosynthesis. Strong wind forces may result in diminished leaf number and surface area, which while reducing drag, involves a [[trade off]] of also reduces photosynthesis. Thus, leaf design may involve compromise between carbon gain, thermoregulation and water loss on the one hand, and the cost of sustaining both static and dynamic loads. In vascular plants, perpendicular forces are spread over a larger area and are relatively flexible in both bending and [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsion]], enabling elastic deforming without damage.{{sfn|Read|Stokes|2006}}

Many leaves rely on [[hydrostatic]] support arranged around a skeleton of vascular tissue for their strength, which depends on maintaining leaf water status. Both the mechanics and architecture of the leaf reflect the need for transportation and support. Read and Stokes (2006) consider two basic models, the "hydrostatic" and "I-beam leaf" form (see Fig 1).{{sfn|Read|Stokes|2006}} Hydrostatic leaves such as in ''[[Prostanthera lasianthos]]'' are large and thin, and may involve the need for multiple leaves rather single large leaves because of the amount of veins needed to support the periphery of large leaves. But large leaf size favours efficiency in photosynthesis and water conservation, involving further trade offs. On the other hand, I-beam leaves such as ''[[Banksia marginata]]'' involve specialised structures to stiffen them. These I-beams are formed from bundle sheath extensions of [[sclerenchyma]] meeting stiffened sub-epidermal layers. This shifts the balance from reliance on hydrostatic pressure to structural support, an obvious advantage where water is relatively scarce.
{{sfn|Read|Stokes|2006}} Long narrow leaves bend more easily than ovate leaf blades of the same area. Monocots typically have such linear leaves that maximise surface area while minimising self-shading. In these a high proportion of longitudinal main veins provide additional support.{{sfn|Read|Stokes|2006}}

=== Interactions with other organisms ===
[[File:Kallima inachus2.jpg|thumb|Some [[insect]]s, like ''[[Kallima inachus]]'', mimic leaves]]
Although not as nutritious as other organs such as fruit, leaves provide a food source for many organisms. The leaf is a vital source of energy production for the plant, and plants have evolved protection against animals that consume leaves, such as [[tannin]]s, chemicals which hinder the digestion of proteins and have an unpleasant taste. Animals that are specialized to eat leaves are known as [[folivore]]s.

Some species have [[crypsis|cryptic]] adaptations by which they use leaves in avoiding predators.  For example, the caterpillars of [[Tortricidae|some leaf-roller moths]] will create a small home in the leaf by folding it over themselves. Some [[Pamphiliidae|sawflies]] similarly roll the leaves of their food plants into tubes. Females of the [[Attelabidae]], so-called leaf-rolling weevils, lay their eggs into leaves that they then roll up as means of protection. Other herbivores and their predators [[mimicry|mimic]] the appearance of the leaf. Reptiles such as some chameleons, and insects such as some [[katydid]]s, also mimic the oscillating movements of leaves in the wind, moving from side to side or back and forth while evading a possible threat.

===Seasonal leaf loss===
[[File:Leaves in autumn.jpg|thumb|Leaves shifting color in autumn (fall)]]
Leaves in [[temperate]], [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]], and seasonally dry zones may be seasonally [[deciduous]] (falling off or dying for the inclement season). This mechanism to shed leaves is called [[abscission]]. When the leaf is shed, it leaves a leaf scar on the twig. In cold autumns, they sometimes [[autumn leaf color|change color]], and turn [[yellow]], bright-[[orange (colour)|orange]], or [[red]], as various accessory pigments ([[carotenoid]]s and [[xanthophyll]]s) are revealed when the tree responds to cold and reduced [[sunlight]] by curtailing chlorophyll production. Red [[anthocyanin]] pigments are now thought to be produced in the leaf as it dies, possibly to mask the yellow hue left when the chlorophyll is lost—yellow leaves appear to attract herbivores such as [[aphids]].{{sfn|Doring et al|2009}} Optical masking of chlorophyll by anthocyanins reduces risk of photo-oxidative damage to leaf cells as they senesce, which otherwise may lower the efficiency of nutrient retrieval from senescing autumn leaves.{{sfn|Feild et al|2001}}

==Evolutionary adaptation==
[[File:Inflorescence 1.jpg|thumb|[[Poinsettia]] [[bract]]s are leaves which have evolved red pigmentation in order to attract insects and birds to the central flowers, an adaptive function normally served by [[petal]]s (which are themselves leaves highly modified by evolution).]]

In the course of [[evolution]], leaves have adapted to different [[environment (biophysical)|environments]] in the following ways:
* [[Epicuticular wax|Waxy]] micro- and nanostructures on the surface reduce wetting by rain and adhesion of contamination (''See [[Lotus effect]]'').
* Divided and compound leaves reduce wind resistance and promote cooling.
* Hairs on the leaf surface trap humidity in dry climates and create a [[boundary layer]] reducing water loss.
* [[Wax]]y plant cuticles reduce water loss.
* Large surface area provides a large area for capture of sunlight.
* In harmful levels of sunlight, specialised leaves, opaque or partly buried, admit light through a translucent [[leaf window]] for photosynthesis at inner leaf surfaces (e.g. ''[[Fenestraria]]'').
* [[Succulent]] leaves store water and organic acids for use in [[CAM photosynthesis]].
* [[Aromatic oil]]s, [[poisons]] or [[pheromones]] produced by leaf borne glands deter herbivores (e.g. [[eucalypts]]).
* Inclusions of crystalline minerals deter herbivores (e.g. [[silica]] [[phytolith]]s in [[grass]]es, [[raphides]] in [[Araceae]]).
* [[Petal]]s attract pollinators.
* [[Spine (botany)|Spines]] protect the plants from herbivores (e.g. [[cacti]]).
* [[Stinging plant|Stinging hairs]] to protect against herbivory, e.g. in ''[[Urtica dioica]]'' and ''[[Dendrocnide moroides]]'' ([[Urticaceae]]).
* Special leaves on carnivorous plants are adapted for trapping food, mainly invertebrate prey, though some species trap small vertebrates as well (see [[carnivorous plant]]s).
* [[Bulb]]s store food and water (e.g. [[onion]]s).
* [[Tendril]]s allow the plant to climb (e.g. peas).
* [[Bract]]s and [[pseudanthium|pseudanthia]] (false flowers) replace normal flower structures when the true flowers are greatly reduced (e.g. [[spurge]]s and [[spathe]]s in the [[Araceae]].

A number of different classification systems of the patterns of leaf veins (venation or veination) have been described,&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; starting with Ettingshausen (1861),{{sfn|Ettingshausen|1861}} together with many different descriptive terms, and the terminology has been described as "formidable".&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; One of the commonest among these is the Hickey system, originally developed for "[[dicotyledons]]" and using a number of Ettingshausen's terms derived from Greek (1973–1979):{{sfn|Hickey|1973}}{{sfn|Hickey|Wolfe|1975}}{{sfn|Hickey|1979}} (''see also'': Simpson Figure 9.12, p.&amp;nbsp;468)&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt;

===== Hickey system =====
;1. [[Pinnate]] (feather-veined, reticulate, pinnate-netted, penniribbed, penninerved, or penniveined): The veins arise [[pinnately]] (feather like) from a single primary vein (mid-vein) and subdivide into secondary veinlets, known as higher order veins. These, in turn, form a complicated network. This type of venation is typical for (but by no means limited to) "[[dicotyledon]]s" (non monocotyledon [[angiosperms]]). E.g., ''[[Ostrya]]''.{{paragraph}} There are three subtypes of pinnate venation:{{glossary}}{{term
 | ''Craspedodromous'' (Greek: ''kraspedon'' - edge, ''dromos'' - running)}}{{defn
 | The major veins reach to the margin of the leaf.}}{{term
 | ''Camptodromous''}}{{defn
 | Major veins extend close to the margin, but bend before they intersect with the margin.}}{{term
 | ''Hyphodromous''}}{{defn
 | All secondary veins are absent, rudimentary or concealed}}{{glossary end}} These in turn have a number of further subtypes such as eucamptodromous, where secondary veins curve near the margin without joining adjacent secondary veins.

}}

;2. Parallelodromous (parallel-veined, parallel-ribbed, parallel-nerved, penniparallel, striate): Two or more primary veins originating beside each other at the leaf base, and running [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other to the apex and then converging there.  Commissural veins (small veins) connect the major parallel veins. Typical for most [[monocotyledon]]s, such as [[Poaceae|grasses]].{{paragraph}} The additional terms marginal (primary veins reach the margin), and reticulate (primary veins do not reach the margin) are also used.

;3. Campylodromous (''campylos'' - curve): Several primary veins or branches originating at or close to a single point and running in recurved arches, then converging at apex. E.g. ''[[Maianthemum]]'' .
{{multiple image

}}

;4. Acrodromous: Two or more primary or well developed secondary veins in convergent arches towards apex, without basal recurvature as in Campylodromous. May be basal or suprabasal depending on origin, and perfect or imperfect depending on whether they reach to 2/3 of the way to the apex. E.g., ''[[Miconia]]'' (basal type), ''[[Endlicheria]]'' (suprabasal type).

;5. Actinodromous: Three or more primary veins diverging radially from a single point. E.g., ''[[Menispermaceae|Arcangelisia]]'' (basal type), ''[[Givotia]]'' (suprabasal type).

;6. Palinactodromous: Primary veins with one or more points of secondary dichotomous branching beyond the primary divergence, either closely or more distantly spaced. E.g., ''[[Platanus]]''.

Types 4–6 may similarly be subclassified as basal (primaries joined at the base of the blade) or suprabasal (diverging above the blade base), and perfect or imperfect, but also flabellate.

At about the same time, Melville (1976) described a system applicable to all Angiosperms and using Latin and English terminology.{{sfn|Melville|1976}} Melville also had six divisions, based on the order in which veins develop.

; Arbuscular (arbuscularis): Branching repeatedly by regular dichotomy to give rise to a three dimensional bush-like structure consisting of linear segment (2 subclasses)
; Flabellate (flabellatus): Primary veins straight or only slightly curved, diverging from the base in a fan-like manner (4 subclasses)
; Palmate (palmatus): Curved primary veins (3 subclasses)
; Pinnate (pinnatus): Single primary vein, the midrib, along which straight or arching secondary veins are arranged at more or less regular intervals (6 subclasses)
; Collimate (collimatus): Numerous longitudinally parallel primary veins arising from a transverse meristem (5 subclasses)
; Conglutinate (conglutinatus): Derived from fused pinnate leaflets (3 subclasses)

A modified form of the Hickey system was later incorporated into the Smithsonian classification (1999) which proposed seven main types of venation, based on the architecture of the primary veins, adding Flabellate as an additional main type. Further classification was then made on the basis of secondary veins, with 12 further types, such as;
; Brochidodromous: Closed form in which the secondaries are joined together in a series of prominent arches, as in ''[[Hildegardia (plant)|Hildegardia]]''.
; Craspedodromous: Open form with secondaries terminating at the margin, in toothed leaves, as in ''[[Celtis]]''.
; Eucamptodromous: Intermediate form with upturned secondaries that gradually diminish apically but inside the margin, and connected by intermediate tertiary veins rather than loops between secondaries, as in ''[[Cornus]]''.
; Cladodromous: Secondaries freely branching toward the margin, as in ''[[Rhus]]''.

Further descriptions included the higher order, or minor veins and the patterns of areoles (''see'' Leaf Architecture Working Group, Figures 28–29).{{sfn|Leaf Architecture Working Group|1999}}

[[File:Adiantum cunninghamii.jpg|thumb|Flabellate venation, ''[[Adiantum cunninghamii]]'']]
;Flabellate: Several to many equal fine basal veins diverging radially at low angles and branching apically. E.g. ''[[Paranomus]]''.

Analyses of vein patterns often fall into consideration of the vein orders, primary vein type, secondary vein type (major veins), and minor vein density. A number of authors have adopted simplified versions of these schemes.{{sfn|Judd et al| 2007}}&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; At its simplest the primary vein types can be considered in three or four groups depending on the plant divisions being considered;
* pinnate
* palmate
* parallel

where palmate refers to multiple primary veins that radiate from the petiole, as opposed to branching from the central main vein in the pinnate form, and encompasses both of Hickey types 4 and 5, which are preserved as subtypes; e.g., palmate-acrodromous (''see'' National Park Service Leaf Guide).{{sfn|Florissant Leaf Key|2016}}

[[File:Acer Truncatum leaf.jpg|thumb|Palmate venation, ''[[Acer truncatum]]'' ]]
;Palmate, Palmate-netted, palmate-veined, fan-veined: Several main veins of approximately equal size [[divergence|diverge]] from a common point near the leaf base where the petiole attaches, and radiate toward the edge of the leaf. Palmately veined leaves are often lobed or divided with lobes radiating from the common point. They may vary in the number of primary veins (3 or more), but always radiate from a common point.&lt;ref name=KlingLv/&gt; e.g. most [[maple|''Acer'']] (maples).

===== Other systems =====
Alternatively, Simpson uses:&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt;

; Uninervous: Central midrib with no lateral veins ([[microphyllous]]), seen in the non-seed bearing [[tracheophytes]], such as [[horsetails]]
; Dichotomous: Veins successively branching into equally sized veins from a common point, forming a Y junction, fanning out. Amongst temperate woody plants, ''[[Ginkgo biloba]]'' is the only species exhibiting dichotomous venation. Also some [[fern|pteridophytes]] (ferns).&lt;ref name=KlingLv/&gt;
; Parallel: Primary and secondary veins roughly parallel to each other, running the length of the leaf, often connected by short perpendicular links, rather than form networks. In some species, the parallel veins join together at the base and apex, such as needle-type evergreens and grasses. Characteristic of monocotyledons, but exceptions include ''[[Arisaema]]'', and as below, under netted.&lt;ref name=KlingLv/&gt;
; Netted (reticulate, pinnate): A prominent midvein with secondary veins branching off along both sides of it. The name derives from the ultimate veinlets which form an interconnecting net like pattern or network. (The primary and secondary venation may be referred to as pinnate, while the net like finer veins are referred to as netted or reticulate); most non-monocot angiosperms, exceptions including ''[[Calophyllum]]''. Some monocots have reticulate venation, including ''[[Colocasia]]'', ''[[Dioscorea]]'' and ''[[Smilax]]''.&lt;ref name=KlingLv/&gt;

However, these simplified systems allow for further division into multiple subtypes. Simpson,&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; (and others){{sfn|Berg|2007}} divides parallel and netted (and some use only these two terms for Angiosperms)&lt;ref name=AMVen/&gt; on the basis of the number of primary veins (costa) as follows;

These complex systems are not used much in morphological descriptions of taxa, but have usefulness in plant identification,
&lt;ref name=SimpsonLv/&gt; although criticized as being unduly burdened with jargon.&lt;ref name=HLlv/&gt;

An older, even simpler system, used in some flora{{sfn|Cullen et al|2011}} uses only two categories, open and closed.&lt;ref name=BeachLv/&gt;
* Open: Higher order veins have free endings among the cells and are more characteristic of non-monocotyledon angiosperms. They are more likely to be associated with leaf shapes that are toothed, lobed or compound. They may be subdivided as;
** Pinnate (feather-veined) leaves, with a main central vein or rib (midrib), from which the remainder of the vein system arises
** Palmate, in which three or more main ribs rise together at the base of the leaf, and diverge upward.
** Dichotomous, as in ferns, where the veins fork repeatedly
* Closed: Higher order veins are connected in loops without ending freely among the cells. These tend to be in leaves with smooth outlines, and are characteristic of monocotyledons.
** They may be subdivided into whether the veins run parallel, as in grasses, or have other patterns.

==== Other descriptive terms ====

There are also many other descriptive terms, often with very specialised usage and confined to specific taxonomic groups.{{sfn|Neotropikey|2017}} The conspicuousness of veins depends on a number of features. These include the width of the veins, their prominence in relation to the lamina surface and the degree of opacity of the surface, which may hide finer veins. In this regard, veins are called '''obscure''' and the order of veins that are obscured and whether upper, lower or both surfaces, further specified.{{sfn|Oxford herbaria glossary|2017}}&lt;ref name=KlingLv/&gt;

Terms that describe vein prominence include '''bullate''', '''channelled''', '''flat''', '''guttered''', '''impressed''', '''prominent''' and '''recessed''' (''Fig''.&amp;nbsp;6.1 Hawthorne &amp; Lawrence 2013).&lt;ref name=HLlv/&gt;&lt;ref name=OxHerbVp/&gt; Veins may show different types of prominence in different areas of the leaf. For instance ''[[Pimenta racemosa]]'' has a channelled midrib on the upper surfae, but this is prominent on the lower surface.&lt;ref name=HLlv/&gt;

Describing vein prominence:

;Bullate: Surface of leaf raised in a series of domes between the veins on the upper surface, and therefore also with marked depressions. e.g. ''[[Rytigynia|Rytigynia pauciflora]]'',{{sfn|Verdcourt|Bridson|1991}} ''[[Vitis vinifera]]''
;Channelled (canalicululate): Veins sunken below the surface, resulting in a rounded channel. Sometimes confused with "guttered" because the channels may function as gutters for rain to run off and allow drying, as in many [[Melastomataceae]].&lt;ref name=Hemsley254/&gt; e.g. (''see'') ''[[Pimenta racemosa]]'' (Myrtaceae),&lt;ref name=OxHerbPimrac/&gt; ''[[Clidemia hirta]]'' (Melastomataceae).
;Guttered: Veins partly prominent, the crest above the leaf lamina surface, but with channels running along each side, like gutters
;Impressed: Vein forming raised line or ridge which lies below the plane of the surface which bears it, as if pressed into it, and are often exposed on the lower surface. Tissue near the veins often appears to pucker, giving them a sunken or embossed appearance
;Obscure: Veins not visible, or not at all clear; if unspecified, then not visible with the naked eye. e.g. ''[[Berberis gagnepainii]]''. In this ''Berberis'', the veins are only obscure on the undersurface.&lt;ref name=CullenBgag/&gt;
;Prominent: Vein raised above surrounding surface so to be easily felt when stroked with finger. e.g. (''see'') ''[[Pimenta racemosa]]'',&lt;ref name=OxHerbPimrac/&gt; ''[[Spathiphyllum|Spathiphyllum cannifolium]]''&lt;ref name=KwantlenSpcan/&gt;
;Recessed: Vein is sunk below the surface, more prominent than surrounding tissues but more sunken in channel than with impressed veins. e.g. ''[[Viburnum plicatum]]''.

Describing other features:
;[[wikt:-plinerved|Plinervy]] (plinerved): More than one main vein (nerve) at the base. Lateral secondary veins branching from a point above the base of the leaf. Usually expressed as a [[suffix]], as in 3-plinerved or triplinerved leaf. In a 3-plinerved (triplinerved) leaf three main veins branch above the base of the lamina (two secondary veins and the main vein) and run essentially parallel subsequently, as in ''[[Ceanothus]]'' and in ''[[Celtis occidentalis|Celtis]]''. Similarly a quintuplinerve (five-veined) leaf has four secondary veins and a main vein. A pattern with 3-7 veins is especially conspicuous in [[Melastomataceae]]. The term has also been used in [[Vaccinieae]]. The term has been used as synonymous with acrodromous, palmate-acrodromous or suprabasal acrodromous, and is thought to be too broadly defined.{{sfn|Pedraza-Peñalosa|2013}}{{sfn|Pedraza-Peñalosa|2013}}
;Scalariform: Veins arranged like the rungs of a ladder, particularly higher order veins
;Submarginal: Veins running close to leaf margin
;Trinerved: 2 major basal nerves besides the midrib

===Size===
{{main article|Leaf size}}
The terms '''megaphyll''', '''macrophyll''', '''mesophyll''', '''notophyll''', '''microphyll''', '''nanophyll''' and '''leptophyll''' are used to describe leaf sizes (in descending order), in a classification devised in 1934 by [[Christen C. Raunkiær]] and since modified by others.{{sfn|Whitten et al|1997}}

'''Libertarian conservatism''' or '''conservative libertarianism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[ideology]] that combines [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] [[politics]] and [[Conservatism|conservative values]]. Libertarian conservatism advocates the greatest possible economic liberty and the least possible government regulation of social life, mirroring ''[[laissez faire|laissez-faire]]'' [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], but harnesses this to a belief in a more traditional and conservative social philosophy emphasizing authority and duty.{{sfn|Heywood|2015|p=37}} Libertarian conservatism prioritizes [[liberty]] as its main emphasis, promoting [[free expression]], [[freedom of choice]] and [[free market capitalism]] to achieve [[Social conservatism|socially]] and [[Cultural conservatism|culturally conservative]] ends as they reject [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]],&lt;ref name=Piper&gt;J. Richard Piper, ''Ideologies and Institutions: American Conservative and Liberal Governance Prescriptions Since 1933'', [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u93Mj3A-tH8C&amp;pg=PA110 pp. 110–111], {{ISBN|0847684598}}, {{ISBN|978-0847684595}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or in the opposite way but not excluding the above, libertarian conservatism could be understood as promoting [[civil society]] through conservative institutions and authority - as family, fatherland, religion, education - in the quest of libertarian ends for less state power.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/getting-libertarianism-right Getting Libertarianism Right]. [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]]. {{ISBN|978-1-61016-690-4}}. [[Mises Institute]] Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
For Larry Johnston, in [[political science]], the term "libertarian conservatism" is used to refer to ideologies that combine the advocacy of economic principles such as [[fiscal discipline]], respect for [[contract]]s, defense of [[private property]] and [[free market]]s{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–56}} and the [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservative]] stress on self-help and freedom of choice under a ''[[laissez-faire]]'' and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] [[Capitalism|capitalist]] society with social tenets such as the importance of [[religion]] and the value of [[Religious morality|traditional morality]]{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=154}} through a framework of [[Limited government|limited]], [[Constitutional government|constitutional]], [[representative government]].{{sfn|Johnston|2007|pp=154–155}}

For Margaret Randall, libertarian conservatism began as an expression of [[individualism]] and the demand for [[personal freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlesinger|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.|title=The Rise of the City: 1878-1898|publisher=The Academy of Political Science|date=September 1933|orig-year=1st pub. 1933|pages=454–456|chapter=Vol. 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Randall|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Randall|title=Sandino's Daughters: Testimonies of Nicaraguan Women in Struggle|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=January 14, 2018|orig-year=1st pub. 1995|pages=ii|chapter=Preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Freedom and Virtue: The Conservative/Libertarian Debate'', edited by George W. Carey, contains essays which describe "the tension between liberty and morality" as "the main fault line dividing the two philosophies".&lt;ref&gt;George W. Carey (Editor), ''Freedom &amp; Virtue: The Conservative Libertarian Debate,'' Intercollegiate Studies Institute, 1998. {{ISBN|1-882926-19-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson Hultberg wrote that there is "philosophical common ground" between libertarians and conservatives. "The true conservative movement was, from the start, a blend of political libertarianism, cultural conservatism, and non-interventionism abroad bequeathed to us via the Founding Fathers". He said that such libertarian conservatism was "hijacked" by [[neoconservatism]], "by the very enemies it was formed to fight – [[Fabian Society|Fabians]], [[New Deal]]ers, [[Welfare state|welfarists]], [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]], globalists, interventionists, militarists, nation builders, and all the rest of the collectivist ilk that was assiduously working to destroy the Founders' Republic of States".&lt;ref&gt;Nelson Hultberg, [http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html "True Conservatism vs. Neo-Conservatism"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820085956/http://www.afr.org/Hultberg/122006.html|date=August 20, 2008}}, [http://afr.org "Americans for a Free Republic"] website, December 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas DiLorenzo]] wrote that libertarian conservative [[Constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] believe that the way to limit government is to enforce the [[United States Constitution]]. However, DiLorenzo criticized them by writing: "The fatal flaw in the thinking of the libertarian/conservative constitutionalists stems from their unawareness or willful ignorance of how the founders themselves believed the Constitution could be enforced: by the citizens of the free, independent, and sovereign states, not the federal judiciary". He wrote that the powers accrued to the federal government during the [[American Civil War]] overthrew the Constitution of 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/dilorenzo/dilorenzo74.html|title=Constitutional Futility|last=DiLorenzo|first=Thomas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950's [[Frank Meyer (political philosopher)|Frank Meyer]], a prominent contributor to the ''[[National Review]]'', called his own combination libertarianism and conservatism as "[[fusionism]]".&lt;ref name="Feser"&gt;Edward Feser, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/feser2.html "What Libertarianism Isn't"], [[Lew Rockwell.com]], December 22, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Raico, [https://mises.org/story/1784 "Is Libertarianism Amoral?"], ''New Individualist Review'', Volume 3, Number 3, Fall 1964, 29–36; republished by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], April 4, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, [[Lew Rockwell]], [[Murray Rothbard]] and others described their libertarian conservative views as [[paleolibertarianism]].&lt;ref name=LR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rockwell|first1=Lew|title=The Case for Paleo-libertarianism|journal=Liberty|issue=January 1990|pages=34–38|url=http://www.pericles.press/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Liberty_Magazine.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued libertarian opposition to "all forms of government intervention – economic, cultural, social, international", but also upholding cultural conservatism in social thought and behavior. They opposed a licentious libertarianism which advocated "freedom from bourgeois morality, and social authority".&lt;ref name=LR/&gt; Rockwell later stated that they dropped that self-description because people confused it with [[paleoconservatism]], which they rejected.&lt;ref name=lewinterview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/liberal-post-interview.html|title=Do You Consider Yourself a Libertarian?|last=Johnsson|first=Kenny|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lrc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rockwell/paleoism.html|title=What I Learned From Paleoism|last=Rockwell|first=Llewellyn H.|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurence M. Vance wrote: "Some libertarians consider libertarianism to be a lifestyle rather than a political philosophy... They apparently don't know the difference between libertarianism and [[libertinism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/vance/vance133.html|title=Is Ron Paul Wrong on Abortion?|last=Vance|first=Laurence|date=January 29, 2008|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Milton Friedman]], [[Richard Posner]], [[Richard Epstein]] and [[Albert Jay Nock]] have been described as libertarian conservatives.&lt;ref name=Piper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://mises.org/library/cultural-thought-ludwig-von-mises-0 Cultural Thought of Ludwig von Mises]. [[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]. 1991. Lew Rockwell and Jeffrey Tucker. Mises Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] [[Ron Paul]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig8/mafaldo1.html|title=The Conservative Case for Ron Paul|last=Mafaldo|first=Lucas|publisher=LewRockwell.com|accessdate=July 2, 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his son [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Rand Paul]] have been described as combining libertarian and conservative "[[small government]]" ideas and showing how the Constitution defends the individual and most libertarian views.

In 1975, [[Ronald Reagan]] stated: "I believe the very heart and soul of conservatism is libertarianism". However, some libertarians criticized Reagan for un-libertarian policy positions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reason.com/news/show/29318.html "Inside Ronald Reagan"], a ''[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]'' interview with Ronald Reagan, July 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Feser]] emphasized that libertarianism does not require individuals to reject traditional conservative values. Libertarianism supports the ideas of [[liberty]], [[privacy]] and ending the [[War on drugs|war on marijuana]] at the legal level without changing personal values.&lt;ref name="Feser"/&gt;

=== Economics ===
Libertarian conservatism subscribes to the libertarian idea of [[free market capitalism]], advocating minimal to no government interference in the [[Market (economics)|market]]. A number of libertarian conservatives favor [[Austrian economics]] and are critical of [[fiat money]], with many supporting policies like [[pay what you want]] cafes. Libertarian conservatives also advocate for ways to [[Privatization|privatize]] services run by the government, from airports to toll booths.

'''Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust''' (MAST) is a [[charitable trust]] founded in February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thisismast.org |title=Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust |publisher=Thisismast.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on investigations into the maritime heritage of the [[United Kingdom]] and further afield, through [[maritime history|historical]] and [[maritime archaeology|archaeological investigations]]. MAST uses its profits from contract work as well as donations to fund its charitable aims.

Its stated objective is to advance the education of the public in maritime heritage, focusing in particular on maritime archaeological material. By such means as the directors in their discretion shall from time to time think fit including the preservation and investigation of shipwrecked vessels and of historically or otherwise valuable maritime material and the dissemination of the educationally useful results of such investigation to the general public. It does this by conducting archaeological surveys and excavations, conservation of material and publication of results.

==Projects==

MAST takes a holistic approach to maritime archaeology covering a wide range of methods and environments including geophysics (both on land and sea), excavations, surveys, conservation and desk-based research.

===HMS Invincible 1744===
In July 2016 MAST received a £2 million grant for the rescue excavation, recovery, conservation and public display of material from the wreck of [[HMS Invincible (1747)]] with partners [[Bournemouth University]], [[National Museum of the Royal Navy]], Dan Pascoe of Pascoe Archaeological Services and Serving and ex-Service volunteers and the Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/libor-fines-to-be-used-to-support-military-charities-and-royal-voluntary-service| title=LIBOR fines to be used to support military charities and Royal Voluntary Service|publisher=HM Treasury|date= 2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chancellor [[George Osborne]] said: "The wreck of the HMS Invincible is an invaluable part of the UK's proud maritime history and it is important we work to save as much as possible. This hugely worthwhile project will support military veterans, serving personnel and disadvantaged teenagers to learn new skills and put artefacts from the wreck on public display for the first time".

The site was first found in 1979 by Arthur Mack. John Bingeman subsequently led excavations between 1980-90 (Bingeman 2010). Dan Pascoe of Pascoe Archaeological Services took the reins in 2010, monitoring the increasingly vulnerable site, undertaking extensive survey work and raising artefacts at risk from destruction, work funded by [[Historic England]]. It was this that led Historic England to recognise the site's vulnerability.

[[Chatham Historic Dockyard]] holds a significant collection of HMS Invincible artefacts. Maritime archaeological material from the 18th century is poorly represented as a whole in the UK considering the amount of wrecks of this era off our coasts. The HMS Invincible 1744 Project will vastly increase our knowledge and understanding of this important era in shipbuilding and ship life.&lt;ref&gt;http://thedockyard.co.uk/explore/command-of-the-ocean/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esmeralda 1503===
Following the discovery of a site consistent with an early 16th-century European wreck off [[Al-Hallaniyah]] in 1998, the Omani government, spearheaded by its Ministry of Heritage and Culture, agreed to initially to a reconnaissance expedition in 2013. [[David Mearns]], director of Blue Water Recoveries, brought together a team of maritime archaeologists from MAST and Bournemouth University, geophysicists and other scientists in 2013 to conduct a reconnaissance survey of the site, 14 years after its initial discovery. The archaeology team, led by Associate Professor Dave Parham of Bournemouth University, was supported by MAST which co-funded the first expedition in 2013. There have two subsequent fieldwork seasons and fieldwork was completed in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mearns|first1=David|last2=Parham|first2=Dave|last3=Frolich|first3=Bruno|title=A Portuguese East Indiaman from the 1502–1503 Fleet of Vasco da Gama off Al Hallaniyah Island, Oman: an interim report|journal=International Journal of Nautical Archaeology|date=14 March 2016|volume=46|issue=2|pages=1–21|doi=10.1111/1095-9270.12175|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1095-9270.12175/full|accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esmeraldashipwreck.com/history/|title=Vasco da Gama shipwreck history following find of Esmeralda Shipwreck off Oman coast|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Navy Loss List===
As part of a team undertaking the 2001 [[UNESCO]] Convention Impact Review for the United Kingdom, MAST completed the [[Royal Navy]] Loss List, a major assessment of the international spread of UK sovereign wrecks.

The RN Loss List, from 1512-1947, is compiled from the volumes and websites listed below from the earliest known RN wreck. The assessment shows that there are over 4,700 Royal Naval wrecks scattered across the oceans of the world, covering the period between 1512 and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rmg.co.uk/discover/researchers/research-guides/research-guide-b3-royal-navy-sources-enquiries&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/underwater-cultural-heritage/about-the-underwater-cultural-heritage/world-war-i/heritage-for-peace-education-initiative/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coronation Geophysical Survey===
A Geophysical Survey was conducted by MAST and the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Maritime Archaeological Society (CISMAS) on the [[HMS Coronation (1685)|Coronation Protected Wreck Site]]. Promare UK was sub-contracted to conduct the magnetometer survey and Swathe Services to conduct a multibeam survey producing a site plan of geo-referenced targets of both designated sites and the Intermediate area.

The Coronation was a 90-gun second rate, built in 1685 by Isaac Betts at Portsmouth dockyard as one of the 1677 thirty-ships programme. On 3 September 1691 after patrolling for the French fleet, the English Fleet made for Plymouth. The Coronation foundered in a strong south easterly gale whilst trying to round Penlee Point with a loss of all but 13 of her crew, including the captain, Charles Skelton.

The Coronation Protected wreck site consists of two designated areas: Inshore (designated 1988) &amp; Offshore (designated 1978). The area in between these two protected sites is known as the "Intermediate" site wherein lies an unverified scatter of archaeological material.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisismast.org/downloads/CoronationWebReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bamburgh Castle Beach Wreck===
A rarely seen portion of an unknown wreck within the intertidal zone of [[Bamburgh Castle]] Beach was reported to MAST by Steve Brown, a PADI Basic Archaeological Diver (BAD) Instructor and local historian. MAST has conducted two preliminary surveys of the site in 2013 to establish the extent of the site and how much remains under the sand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thisismast.org/downloads/bamburghcastle_v3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival and position of some of the features within the wreck would suggest that the buried structure could be mostly intact as the position of hull structure, deck beams, masts and even deck fittings are all as would be expected from a mostly intact buried vessel.

[[Dendrochronology|Dendrochronological]] samples were taken as part of this survey to try and establish the date and origin of the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.northumberlandgazette.co.uk/news/local-news/shipwreck-offers-unique-opportunity-for-study-1-6119465 |title=Shipwreck offers unique opportunity for study |publisher=Northumberland Gazette |date=2013-10-05 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is now protected under the [[Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979]].

===Swash Channel Wreck Artefacts===
MAST has donated funds to conserve three of the carvings from the [[Swash Channel Wreck]] as well as a [[Canister shot|canister]]

They were raised in August 2010. The two carvings were found directly above the gunports in the bowcastle and are in extremely good condition. They bring the number of carvings found on the site to five.

The work will be done by the [[York Archaeological Trust]]. Once conserved you will be able to see the artefacts up close at [[Poole Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismast.org/projects.html |title=Maritime Archaeology Sea Trust : Swash Channel Wreck Artefacts |publisher=Thisismast.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scubaverse.com/2013/09/20/uk-minister-for-culture-ed-vaizey-visits-the-maritime-archaeology-sea-trust-mast/ |title=UK Minister For Culture Ed Vaizey Visits The York Archaeology Trust To View Marine Artefacts &amp;#124; Scubaverse &amp;#124; The World's Best Online Dive Companion |publisher=Scubaverse |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191210/http://www.scubaverse.com/2013/09/20/uk-minister-for-culture-ed-vaizey-visits-the-maritime-archaeology-sea-trust-mast/ |archivedate=2 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-23602554 |title=BBC News - Poole Swash Channel Wreck: Raising the rudder |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-08-19 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== MoD wrecks===
MAST, in partnership with [[Bournemouth University]], won a Ministry of Defence (MoD) contract to assess the environmental and safety risks posed by the tankers [[RFA Creosol]] (1916), [[RFA War Mehtar]] (1919) and the escort carrier [[HMS Dasher (D37)]]. This assessment includes research into the history of the wreck and its cargo/contents.

The ships fall into two broad groups, purpose-built tankers and an escort aircraft carrier converted from a merchant ship. The first two are relatively simple vessels and the third a much more complex vessel that is likely to be complicated by its conversion and change of use and reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismast.org/mod-wrecks.html |title=MoD wrecks |publisher=Thisismast.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Not for Profit==
MAST has conducted two major charity events off [[Plymouth Sound]]. One in 2012 and one in 2013. In September 2012 MAST raised £6,000 to raise awareness for maritime heritage in the UK and for the [[RNLI]]'s Plymouth branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rnli.org/NewsCentre/Pages/Plymouth-RNLI-receives-%C2%A31000-donation.aspx |title=Plymouth RNLI receives £1,000 donation |publisher=Rnli.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, MAST raised money again to raise awareness for the need to protect UK maritime heritage but also for the charity [[Battle Back Challenge Centre|Battle Back]] which received £2,000 towards helping injured Service personnel in their rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herald |first=Plymouth |url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/Divers-delving-deep-help-injured-heroes/story-19672043-detail/story.html |title=Divers delving deep to help injured heroes |publisher=Plymouth Herald |date=2013-08-17 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diving Speciality==
In 2012 MAST created a [[PADI]] Distinctive Specialty called Basic Archaeological Diver, a no frills, no fuss introduction to the basics of archaeology underwater with simple recording techniques using little more than a camera and tape measures. The course is now also an [[Scuba Schools International]] accredited course and is recognised by [[British Sub Aqua Club]] (BSAC). The course is an introduction to the basics includes a lecture on the laws governing divers and underwater archaeology in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dive Training |url=http://www.scubaverse.com/2013/08/05/an-introduction-to-the-padi-distinctive-specialty-b-a-d-basic-archaeological-diver/ |title=An Introduction to the PADI Distinctive Specialty B.A.D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5740">'''Master of Commerce''' ('''MCom''' or '''M Comm'''; sometimes ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]] Commercii'') is a [[postgraduate]] [[master's degree]] focusing on  [[commerce]]-, [[accounting]]-, [[management]]- and [[economics]]-related subjects. Like the undergraduate [[Bachelor of Commerce]], the degree is offered in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations.

The Master of Commerce typically requires two years of full-time study.  The [[Curriculum of the Waldorf schools|&lt;u&gt;curriculum&lt;/u&gt;]] is generally concentrated on one subject area, see aside, and emphasizes underlying [[theory]]. Relatedly, programs usually include a [[thesis]] component,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120125035948/http://www.wits.ac.za/academic/clm/sebs/newsebswebsite/postgraduateprogrammes/14707/masters_amp%3B_phd.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and may be exclusively research based.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100124080827/http://www.ucc.ie/en/study/postgrad/research/masters/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131212232222/http://www.unisa.ac.za/Default.asp?Cmd=ViewContent&amp;ContentID=26738]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessandeconomics.mq.edu.au/postgraduate_coursework_programs/master_of_commerce |title=Master of Commerce |website=Macquarie University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this structure, the MCom differs from other business and management degrees: 
*Its concentration on one area distinguishes it from generalist degrees, such as the [[MBA]]. Some universities offer the MCom in [[management|general management]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150124141612/http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/management/departments/bit/coursesandprogrammes/Postgraduate/Documents/MCOM%20BROCHURE%20AND%20APPLICATION%20FORM.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; although this is more similar to the [[Master of Management]] than to the MBA;&lt;ref name="financialmail1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090924015943/http://secure.financialmail.co.za/09/0918/cover/coverstory.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  see also [[Master of Business]]. 
*As compared to specialised [[Professional degree]]s - such as the [[Master of Science in Finance]] or [[Master of Accounting]] - the MCom places more emphasis on theory; see also [[Master of Science in Management]]. 

Admission to the MCom usually requires completion of a [[Bachelor of Commerce]], or similar compatible degree; often, an [[Honours Bachelor of Commerce|"Honours degree"]] will be required.  Depending on the degree focus, a related undergraduate major and / or a fairly strong quantitative background may also be a prerequisite.  Some MCom programs admit students from science or [[engineering]] backgrounds - these programs usually require that students complete a bridging course, &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110509063150/http://www.uj.ac.za/EN/Faculties/management/departments/infoman/coursesandprogrammes/Postgraduate/Pages/MComBusManIKM.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; or undertake an extended program.&lt;ref name="uq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uq.edu.au/study/program.html?acad_prog=5165 |title=Master of Commerce |website=The University of Queensland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post graduation==
Based on specialisation, MCom graduates are typically employed in fields related to their degree foci, such as financial services, marketing and project management; graduates also often work in general management and [[business consulting]]&lt;ref name="uq" /&gt; 

[[Programs of political parties in Armenia|Programs]] are sometimes structured such that graduates are eligible for membership of various [[Professional association|professional bodies]] or [[:Category:Business and finance professional associations|institutes]].&lt;ref name="uq"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ru.ac.za/economics/studying/postgraduate/mastersfinancialmarkets/ |title=Masters In Financial Markets |website=Rhodes University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/plans/2011/INFSAS8404.html |title=Information Systems |website=The University of New South Wales |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411063223/http://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/postgraduate/plans/2011/INFSAS8404.html |archivedate=2011-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the institutional qualification program itself, may, in fact, be offered as an MCom degree (e.g. the Australian [[Institute of Public Accountants]] formerly offered its [[Institute of Public Accountants#IPA Program|IPA program]] as an ''MCom in Public Accounting''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://my.une.edu.au/courses/2017/courses/MCPA |title=Master of Commerce (Public Accounting) |website=The University of New England}}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to July, 2017.)

The MCom includes a research component and thus provides access to a [[doctorate]]; progressing from the MCom, a student can pursue a [[Doctor of Commerce]] (DCom), [[Doctor of Business Administration]] (DBA), or a [[PhD in management|Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D) degree program.

{{Paleontology}}
'''Micropaleontology''' (American spelling; spelled '''micropalaeontology''' in European usage) is the branch of [[paleontology]] ([[palaeontology]]) that studies '''microfossils''', or fossils that require the use of a microscope to see the organism, its morphology and its characteristic details.

== Microfossils ==
[[File:Diatomaceous Earth BrightField.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Diatomaceous earth]] is a soft, [[siliceous]], [[sedimentary rock]] made up of microfossils in the form of the [[frustule]]s (shells) of single cell [[diatoms]]. This sample consists of a mixture of centric (radially symmetric) and pennate (bilaterally symmetric) diatoms. This image of diatomaceous earth particles in [[water]] is at a scale of 6.236 pixels/[[μm]], the entire image covers a region of approximately 1.13 by 0.69 [[millimetre|mm]].]]
''Microfossils'' are [[fossils]] that are generally between 0.001mm and 1&amp;nbsp;mm in size,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drewes|first1=Charlie|title=Discovering Devonian Microfossils|url=http://www.eeob.iastate.edu/faculty/DrewesC/htdocs/microfossilsABLE.doc|publisher=Iowa State University|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the study of which requires the use of light or electron [[microscopy]]. Fossils which can be studied with the naked eye or low-powered magnification, such as a hand lens, are referred to as [[macrofossil]]s.

For example, some colonial organisms, such as [[Bryozoa]] (especially the [[Cheilostomata]]) have relatively large [[colony (biology)|colonies]], but are classified by fine skeletal details of the small individuals of the colony.

In another example, many fossil [[genus|genera]] of [[Foraminifera]], which are protists are known from shells (called "tests") that were as big as coins, such as the genus ''[[Nummulites]]''.

Microfossils are a common feature of the [[geologic timescale|geological record]], from the [[Precambrian]] to the [[Holocene]]. They are most common in deposits of [[ocean|marine]] environments, but also occur in brackish water, fresh water and terrestrial [[sedimentary]] deposits. While every [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] of [[prehistoric life|life]] is represented in the microfossil record, the most abundant forms are [[protist]] skeletons or cysts from the [[Chrysophyta]], [[Pyrrhophyta]], [[Sarcodina]], [[acritarch]]s and [[chitinozoa]]ns, together with [[pollen]] and [[spores]] from the [[vascular plant]]s.

In 2017, fossilized [[microorganism]]s, or [[Micropaleontology#Microfossils|microfossils]], were announced to have been discovered in [[hydrothermal vent]] [[precipitates]] in the [[Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt|Nuvvuagittuq Belt]] of Quebec, Canada that may be as old as 4.28 billion years old, the [[Earliest known life forms|oldest record of life on Earth]], suggesting "an almost instantaneous emergence of life" (in a geological time-scale sense), after [[Origin of water on Earth#Water in the development of Earth|ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago]], and not long after the [[Age of the Earth|formation of the Earth]] 4.54 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="NAT-20170301"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dodd, Matthew S. |author2=Papineau, Dominic |author3=Grenne, Tor |author4=slack, John F. |author5=Rittner, Martin |author6=Pirajno, Franco |author7=O'Neil, Jonathan |author8=Little, Crispin T.

Micropaleontology can be roughly divided into four areas of study on the basis of microfossil composition: (a) [[calcareous]], as in [[coccolith]]s and [[foraminifera]], (b) [[Phosphate|phosphatic]], as in the study of some [[vertebrate]]s, (c) [[silicate|siliceous]], as in [[diatom]]s and [[radiolaria]], or (d) [[organic matter|organic]], as in the [[pollen]] and [[spores]] studied in [[palynology]].

This division reflects differences in the mineralogical and chemical composition of microfossil remains (and therefore in the methods of fossil recovery) rather than any strict [[scientific classification|taxonomic]] or [[ecological]] distinctions. Most researchers in this [[field research|field]], known as '''micropaleontologists''', are typically specialists in one or more [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic groups]].

=== Calcareous microfossils ===
[[File:Nummulitids.jpg|thumb|Fossil [[Nummulites|nummulitid]] foraminiferans showing microspheric and megalospheric individuals; [[Eocene]] of the [[United Arab Emirates]]; scale in mm.]]
[[Calcareous]] ([[Calcium carbonate|CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) microfossils include [[coccolith]]s, [[foraminifera]], [[calcareous dinoflagellate cysts]], and [[ostracod]]s (seed shrimp).

=== Phosphatic microfossils ===
[[Phosphate|Phosphatic]] microfossils include [[conodont]]s (tiny oral structures of an extinct chordate group), some [[scolecodonts]] ("worm" jaws), [[Shark]] spines and teeth, and other [[Fish]] remains (collectively called "[[ichthyolith]]s").

=== Siliceous microfossils ===
[[Silicate|Siliceous]] microfossils include [[diatoms]], [[radiolaria]]ns, [[silicoflagellate]]s, [[Ebriid|ebridians]], [[phytolith]]s, some [[scolecodonts]] ("worm" jaws), and [[sponge spicule]]s.

=== Organic microfossils ===
The study of [[organic matter|organic]] microfossils is called [[palynology]]. Organic microfossils include [[pollen]], [[spores]], [[chitinozoa]]ns (thought to be the egg cases of marine invertebrates), [[scolecodonts]] ("worm" jaws), [[acritarchs]], [[dinoflagellate cysts]], and [[fungal]] remains.

== Methods ==
Sediment or rock samples are collected from either cores or outcrops, and the microfossils they contain are extracted by a variety of physical and chemical laboratory techniques, including sieving, density separation by [[centrifuge]] or in heavy liquids, and chemical digestion of the unwanted fraction. The resulting concentrated sample of microfossils is then mounted on a slide for analysis, usually by light microscope. Taxa are then identified and counted. The enormous numbers of microfossils that a small sediment sample can often yield allows the collection of statistically robust datasets which can be subjected to [[multivariate statistics|multivariate]] analysis. A typical microfossil study will involve identification of a few hundred specimens from each sample.

== Applications of micropaleontology ==
Microfossils are especially noteworthy for their importance in [[biostratigraphy]].  Since microfossils are often extremely abundant, widespread, and quick to appear and disappear from the stratigraphic record, they constitute ideal [[index fossils]] from a biostratigraphic perspective.  Also, the [[planktonic]] and [[nektonic]] habits of some microfossils give them the bonus of appearing across a wide range of [[facies]] or paleoenvironments, as well as having near-global distribution, making biostratigraphic correlation even more powerful and effective.

Microfossils, particularly from deep-sea sediments, also provide some of the most important records of global environmental change on long, medium or short timescales.&lt;ref&gt;Ovechkina, M.N. 2007. Calcareous nannoplankton of the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian and Maastrichtian) of the southern and eastern Russian Platform. Nauka, Moscow. 353 pp. {{ISBN|978-5-02-035758-7}} [https://archive.org/details/Ovechkina_2007_Calcareous_Nannoplankton_of_Upper_Cretaceous]&lt;/ref&gt; Across vast areas of the ocean floor, the shells of planktonic micro-organisms sinking from surface waters provide the dominant source of sediment, and they continuously accumulate (typically at rates of 20–50&amp;nbsp;million per million years). Study of changes in assemblages of microfossils and changes in their shell chemistry (e.g., oxygen isotope composition) are fundamental to research on climate change in the geological past.

In addition to providing an excellent tool for [[sedimentary rock]] dating and for paleoenvironmental reconstruction – heavily used in both [[petroleum]] [[geology]] and [[paleoceanography]] – micropaleontology has also found a number of less orthodox applications, such as its growing role in [[forensic]] police investigation or in determining the provenance of [[archaeological]] artefacts.

Micropaleontology is also a tool of [[geoarchaeology]] used in the archaeological reconstruction of human habitation sites and environments.  Changes in the microfossil population abundance in the stratigraphy of current and former water bodies reflect changes in environmental conditions.  Naturally occurring [[ostracods]] in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity and pH due to human activities. When correlated with other dating techniques, prehistoric environments can be reconstructed. Work on [[Lake Tanganyika]] provided a profile of human-induced environmental changes of a 4,000-year period.&lt;ref name=" Palacios_etal "&gt;{{cite journal |author=M. Palacios-Fest |url=http://www.tnesr.com/images/Palacios_etal_2005_b.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717064447/http://www.tnesr.com/images/Palacios_etal_2005_b.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-17 |title= Paleolimnological investigations of anthropogenic environmental change in Lake Tanganyika: IV.

[[File:John Looney House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Dogtrot house]]s are designed to maximise natural ventilation.]]
'''Natural ventilation''' is the process of supplying air to and removing air from an indoor space without using [[HVAC|mechanical systems]]. It refers to the flow of external air to an indoor space as a result of [[pressure]] differences arising from natural forces. There are two types of natural [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] occurring in buildings: ''wind driven ventilation'' and ''buoyancy-driven ventilation''. Wind driven ventilation arises from the different pressures created by wind around a building or structure, and openings being formed on the perimeter which then permit flow through the building. Buoyancy-driven ventilation occurs as a result of the directional buoyancy force that results from temperature differences between the interior and exterior.&lt;ref name=Linden&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Linden | first1 = P. F. | doi = 10.1146/annurev.fluid.31.1.201 | title = The Fluid Mechanics of Natural Ventilation | journal = Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics | volume = 31 | pages = 201–238 | year = 1999 | pmid =  | pmc = | url = |bibcode = 1999AnRFM..31..201L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the internal heat gains which create temperature differences between the interior and exterior are created by natural processes, including the heat from people, and wind effects are variable, naturally ventilated buildings are sometimes called "breathing buildings".

==Process==
The static [[pressure]] of air is the pressure in a free-flowing air stream and is depicted by [[Contour line|isobars]] in [[weather map]]s. Differences in static pressure arise from global and [[microclimate]] thermal phenomena and create the air flow we call [[wind]]. [[Dynamic pressure]] is the pressure exerted when the wind comes into contact with an object such as a hill or a building and it is described by the following equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clancy|first=L.J.|title=Aerodynamics|year=1975|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;q = \tfrac12\, \rho\, v^{2},&lt;/math&gt;

where (using [[International System of Units|SI]] units):

:{| border="0"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;q\;&lt;/math&gt;    || = dynamic [[pressure]] in [[Pascal (unit)|pascals]],
|-

|-
| &lt;math&gt;v\;&lt;/math&gt;    || = fluid [[velocity]] in m/s.
|}

The impact of wind on a building affects the ventilation and [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration]] rates through it and the associated heat losses or heat gains. Wind speed increases with height and is lower towards the ground due to frictional drag.

The impact of wind on the building form creates areas of positive pressure on the [[windward]] side of a building and negative pressure on the [[leeward]] and sides of the building. Thus, the building shape and local wind patterns are crucial in creating the wind pressures that will drive air flow through its apertures. In practical terms wind pressure will vary considerably creating complex air flows and turbulence by its interaction with elements of the natural environment (trees, hills) and urban context (buildings, structures). Vernacular and traditional buildings in different climatic regions rely heavily upon natural ventilation for maintaining [[thermal comfort]] conditions in the enclosed spaces. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Design==
Design guidelines are offered in [[Building code|building regulations]] and other related literature and include a variety of recommendations on many specific areas such as:
* Building location and orientation
* Building form and dimensions
* Indoor partitions and layout
* [[Window]] typologies, operation, location, and shapes
* Other aperture types ([[door]]s, [[chimney]]s)
* Construction methods and detailing (infiltration)
* External elements (walls, screens)
* [[Urban planning]] conditions

The following design guidelines are selected from the [[Whole Building Design Guide]], a program of the [[National Institute of Building Sciences]]:&lt;ref name=WBDG&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=Andy|title=Natural Ventilation|url=http://www.wbdg.org/resources/naturalventilation.php|publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Maximize wind-induced ventilation by siting the ridge of a building perpendicular to the summer winds
* Widths of naturally ventilated zone should be narrow (max 13.7 m [45 feet])
* Each room should have two separate supply and exhaust openings.  Locate exhaust high above inlet to maximize stack effect.  Orient windows across the room and offset from each other to maximize mixing within the room while minimizing the obstructions to airflow within the room.
* Window openings should be operable by the occupants
* Consider the use of clerestories or vented skylights.

==Wind driven ventilation==
Wind driven ventilation can be classified as cross ventilation and single-sided ventilation. Wind driven ventilation depends on wind behavior, on the interactions with the building envelope and on openings or other air exchange devices such as inlets or chimneys. For a simple volume with two openings, the cross wind flow rate can be calculated using the following equation:&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook"&gt;{{cite book|title=ASHRAE Handbook|year=2009|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q = U_{\textrm{wind}}\sqrt{\frac{C_{\textrm{p1}}-C_{\textrm{p2}}}{1/\left(A_{\textrm{1}}^2C_{\textrm{1}}^2\right)+1/\left(A_{\textrm{2}}^2C_{\textrm{2}}^2\right)}}\qquad{}\left(1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_{\textrm{wind}}&lt;/math&gt; is the far-field wind speed; &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{p1}}&lt;/math&gt; is a local pressure drag coefficient for the building, defined at the location of the upstream opening; &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{p2}}&lt;/math&gt; is a local pressure drag coefficient for the building, defined at the location of the downstream opening; &lt;math&gt;A_{\textrm{1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the upstream opening; &lt;math&gt;A_{\textrm{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the cross-sectional area of the downstream opening; &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{1}}&lt;/math&gt; is the discharge coefficient of the upstream opening; and &lt;math&gt;C_{\textrm{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is the discharge coefficient of the downstream opening.

For rooms with single opening, the calculation of ventilation rate is more complicated than cross-ventilation due to the bi-directional flow and strong turbulent effect. The ventilation rate for single-sided ventilation can be accurately predicted by combining different models for mean flow, pulsating flow and eddy penetration.&lt;ref name="H. Wang &amp; Q. Chen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Haojie |author2=Qingyan Chen|title=A New Empirical Model for Predicting Single-Sided, Wind-Driven Natural Ventilation in Buildings |journal=Energy and Buildings|year=2012|volume=54|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2012.07.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mean flow rate for single-sided ventilation is determined by

&lt;math&gt; \bar{Q} = \frac{C_{d}\; l\; \sqrt {Cp}\;\int\limits_{z_{0}}^h \sqrt{-\frac{2\;\Delta\;P(z)}{\rho}}\, \mathrm{d}z}{z_{ref}^ {1/7}} \; \bar{U}&lt;/math&gt;

where

''l'' = width of the window;

''h'' = elevation of the top edge of the window;

''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = elevation of neural level (where inside and outside pressure balance);

''z''&lt;sub&gt;ref&lt;/sub&gt; = reference elevation where the wind velocity is measured (at 10 m) and

&lt;math&gt; \bar{U}&lt;/math&gt; = mean wind velocity at the reference elevation.

The knowledge of the urban climatology i.e. the wind around the buildings is crucial when evaluating the air quality and thermal comfort inside buildings as air and heat exchange depends on the wind pressure on facades. As we can see in the equation (1), the air exchange depends linearly on the wind speed in the urban place where the architectural project will be built. CFD ([[Computational Fluid Dynamics]]) tools and zonal modelings are usually used to design naturally ventilated buildings. [[Windcatcher]]s are able to aid wind driven ventilation by directing air in and out of buildings.

Some of the important limitations of wind driven ventilation:
* Unpredictability and difficulties in harnessing due to speed and direction variations
* The [[Indoor air quality|quality of air]] it introduces in buildings may be polluted for example due to proximity to an urban or industrial area
* May create a strong draught, discomfort.

==Buoyancy-driven ventilation==
::''(For more details on displacement buoyancy-driven ventilation (rather than mixing type buoyancy-driven ventilation), see [[Stack effect]])''

Buoyancy driven ventilation arise due to differences in density of interior and exterior air, which in large part arises from differences in temperature. When there is a temperature difference between two adjoining volumes of air the warmer air will have lower density and be more buoyant thus will rise above the cold air creating an upward air stream. Forced upflow buoyancy driven ventilation in a building takes place in a traditional fireplace. Passive stack ventilators are common in most bathrooms and other type of spaces without direct access to the outdoors.

In order for a building to be ventilated adequately via buoyancy driven ventilation, the inside and outside temperatures must be different. When the interior is warmer than the exterior, indoor air rises and escapes the building at higher apertures. If there are lower apertures then colder, denser air from the exterior enters the building through them, thereby creating upflow displacement ventilation. However, if there are no lower apertures present, then both in- and out-flow will occur through the high level opening. This is called mixing ventilation. This latter strategy still results in fresh air reaching to low level, since although the incoming cold air will mix with the interior air, it will always be more dense than the bulk interior air and hence fall to the floor. Buoyancy-driven ventilation increases with greater temperature difference, and increased height between the higher and lower apertures in the case of displacement ventilation. When both high and low level openings are present, the neutral plane in a building occurs at the location between the high and low openings at which the internal pressure will be the same as the external pressure (in the absence of wind). Above the neutral plane, the internal air pressure will be positive and air will flow out of any intermediate level apertures created. Below the neutral plane the internal air pressure will be negative and external air will be drawn into the space through any intermediate level apertues. Buoyancy-driven ventilation has several significant benefits: {See Linden, P Annu Rev Fluid Mech, 1999}
* Does not rely on wind: can take place on still, hot summer days when it is most needed.
* Stable air flow (compared to wind)
* Greater control in choosing areas of air intake
* Sustainable method

Limitations of buoyancy-driven ventilation:
* Lower magnitude compared to wind ventilation on the windiest days
* Relies on temperature differences (inside/outside)
* Design restrictions (height, location of apertures) and may incur extra costs (ventilator stacks, taller spaces)
* The quality of air it introduces in buildings may be polluted for example due to proximity to an urban or industrial area (although this can also be a factor in wind-driven ventilation)

Natural ventilation in buildings can rely mostly on wind pressure differences in windy conditions, but buoyancy effects can a) augment this type of ventilation and b) ensure air flow rates during still days. Buoyancy-driven ventilation can be implemented in ways that air inflow in the building does not rely solely on wind direction. In this respect, it may provide improved air quality in some types of polluted environments such as cities. For example, air can be drawn through the backside or courtyards of buildings avoiding the direct pollution and noise of the street facade. Wind can augment the buoyancy effect, but can also reduce its effect depending on its speed, direction and the design of air inlets and outlets. Therefore, prevailing winds must be taken into account when designing for stack effect ventilation.

==Estimating buoyancy-driven ventilation==
The natural ventilation flow rate for buoyancy-driven natural ventilation with vents at two different heights can be estimated with this equation:&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Handbook" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Q_{S} = C_{d}\; A\; \sqrt {2\;g\;H_{d}\;\frac{T_I-T_O}{T_I}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Assessing performance==
One way to measure the performance of a naturally ventilated space is to measure the [[air changes per hour]] in an interior space.  In order for ventilation to be effective, there must be exchange between outdoor air and room air.  A common method for measuring ventilation effectiveness is to use a [[tracer gas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McWilliams|first=Jennifer|title=Review of air flow measurement techniques.  LBNL Paper LBNL-49747.|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7532b84f?query=Review%20of%20air%20flow%20measurement%20techniques|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Lab|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first step is to close all windows, doors, and openings in the space. Then a tracer gas is added to the air. The reference, [[American Society for Testing and Materials]] (ASTM) Standard E741: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution, describes which tracer gases can be used for this kind of testing and provides information about the chemical properties, health impacts, and ease of detection.&lt;ref name="ASTM Standard E741"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ASTM Standard E741-11: Standard Test Method for Determining Air Change in a Single Zone by Means of a Tracer Gas Dilution|year=2006|publisher=ASTM International|location=West Conshohocken, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once the tracer gas has been added, mixing fans can be used to distribute the tracer gas as uniformly as possible throughout the space.  To do a decay test, the concentration of the tracer gas is first measured when the concentration of the tracer gas is constant.  Windows and doors are then opened and the concentration of the tracer gas in the space is measured at regular time intervals to determine the decay rate of the tracer gas.  The airflow can be deduced by looking at the change in concentration of the tracer gas over time.  For further details on this test method, refer to ASTM Standard E741.&lt;ref name="ASTM Standard E741"/&gt;

While natural ventilation eliminates electrical energy consumed by fans, overall energy consumption of natural ventilation systems is often higher than that of modern mechanical ventilation systems featuring [[Heat recovery ventilation|heat recovery]]. Typical modern mechanical ventilation systems use as little as 2000 J/m3 for fan operation, and in cold weather they can recover much more energy than this in the form of heat transferred from waste exhaust air to fresh supply air using [[recuperator]]s.

Ventilation heat loss can be calculated as: theta=Cp*rho*dT*(1-eta).

Where:

Theta is ventilation heat loss in W

Cp is specific heat capacity of air (~1000 J/(kg*K))

Rho is air density (~1.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m3)

dT is the temperature difference between inside and outside air in °K or °C

Eta is the heat recovery efficiency - (typically around 0.8 with heat recovery and 0 if no heat recovery device is used).

The temperature differential needed between indoor and outdoor air for mechanical ventilation with heat recovery to outperform natural ventilation in terms of overall energy efficiency can therefore be calculated as:

dT=SFP/(Cp*Rho*(1-eta))

Where:

SFP is specific fan power in Pa, J/m^3, or W/(m^3/s)

Under typical comfort ventilation conditions with a heat recovery efficiency of 80% and a SFP of 2000 J/m3 we get:

dT=2000/(1000*1.2*(1-0.8))=8.33 K

In climates where the mean absolute difference between inside and outside temperatures exceeds ~10K the energy conservation argument for choosing natural over mechanical ventilation might therefore be questioned. It should however be noted that heating energy might be cheaper and more environmentally friendly than electricity. This is especially the case in areas where [[district heating]] is available.

To develop natural ventilation systems with heat recovery two inherent challenges must first be solved:

# Providing efficient heat recovery at very low driving pressures.
# Physically or thermally connecting supply and exhaust air streams. (Stack ventilation typically relies on supply and exhaust being placed low and high respectively, while wind driven natural ventilation normally relies on openings being placed on opposing sides of a building for efficient cross ventilation.)

Research aiming at the development of natural ventilation systems featuring heat recovery have been made as early as 1993 where Shultz et al&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Schultz, J. M., 1993. Naturlig ventilation med varmegenvinding, Lyngby: Laboratoriet for Varmeisolering, DTH. (Danish)&lt;/ref&gt; proposed and tested a chimney type design relying on stack effect while recovering heat using a large counterflow recuperator constructed from corrugated galvanized iron. Both supply and exhaust happened through an unconditioned attic space, with exhaust air being extracted at ceiling height and air being supplied at floor level through a vertical duct.

The device was found to provide sufficient ventilation air flow for a single family home and heat recovery with an efficiency around 40%. The device was however found to be too large and heavy to be practical, and the heat recovery efficiency too low to be competitive with mechanical systems of the time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Later attempts have primarily focused on wind as the main driving force due to its higher pressure potential. This however introduces an issue of there being large fluctuations in driving pressure.

With the use of wind towers placed on the roof of ventilated spaces, supply and exhaust can be placed close to each other on opposing sides of the small towers.&lt;ref&gt;Calautit, J. K., O'Connor, D. &amp; Hughes, B. R., 2015. A natural ventilation wind tower with heat pipe heat recovery for cold climates. Renewable Energy, I(87), pp. 1088-1104.&lt;/ref&gt; These systems often feature finned [[heat pipe]]s although this limits the theoretical maximum heat recovery efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Gan, G. &amp; Riffat, S., 1999. A study of heat-pipe heat recovery for natural ventilation. AIVC, 477(12), pp. 57-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid coupled run around loops have also been tested to achieve indirect thermal connection between exhaust and supply air. While these tests have been somewhat successful, liquid coupling introduces mechanical pumps that consume energy to circulate the working fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Hviid, C. A. &amp; Svendsen, S., 2008. Passive ventilation systems with heat recovery and night cooling.

Wind- and stack-assisted mechanical, Lyngby: DTU Byg.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some commercially available solutions have been available for years,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Autodesk, 2012. Passive Heat Recovering Ventilation System. [Online]  Available at: sustainabilityworkshop.autodesk.com/project-gallery/passive-heat-recovering-ventilationsystem&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ventive.co.uk/|title=Ventive|website=ventive.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; the claimed performance by manufacturers has yet to be verified by independent scientific studies. This might explain the apparent lack of market impact of these commercially available products claiming to deliver natural ventilation and high heat recovery efficiencies.

A radically new approach to natural ventilation with heat recovery is currently being developed at Aarhus University, where heat exchange tubes are integrated into structural concrete slabs between building floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stackhr.com/p/how-it-works.html|title=How it works|website=www.stackhr.com|access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
For standards relating to ventilation rates, in the United States refer to [[ASHRAE]] Standard 62.1-2010: Ventilation for Acceptable [[Indoor Air Quality]].&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1-2010: Ventilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality|year=2010|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requirements are for "all spaces intended for human occupancy except those within single-family houses, multifamily structures of three stories or fewer above grade, vehicles, and aircraft."&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt;  In the revision to the standard in 2010, Section 6.4 was modified to specify that most buildings designed to have systems to naturally condition spaces must also "include a mechanical ventilation system designed to meet the Ventilation Rate or IAQ procedures [in ASHRAE 62.1-2010].  The mechanical system is to be used when windows are closed due to extreme outdoor temperatures noise and security concerns".&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt; The standard states that two exceptions in which naturally conditioned buildings do not require mechanical systems are when:
* Natural ventilation openings that comply with the requirements of Section 6.4 are permanently open or have controls that prevent the openings from being closed during period of expected occupancy, or
* The zone is not served by heating or cooling equipment.

Also, an authority having jurisdiction may allow for the design of conditioning system that does not have a mechanical system but relies only on natural systems.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt;  In reference for how controls of conditioning systems should be designed, the standard states that they must take into consideration measures to "properly coordinate operation of the natural and mechanical ventilation systems."&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.1"/&gt;

Another reference is ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2010: Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in [[low-rise]] Residential Buildings.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.2"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2010: Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in Low-Rise Residential Buildings|year=2010|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These requirements are for "single-family houses and multifamily structures of three stories or fewer above grade, including manufactured and modular houses," but is not applicable "to transient housing such as hotels, motels, nursing homes, dormitories, or jails."&lt;ref name="ASHRAE 62.2"/&gt;

For standards relating to ventilation rates, in the United States refer to [[ASHRAE]] Standard 55-2010: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"&gt;{{cite journal|title=ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2010: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy|year=2010|publisher=American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, GA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout its revisions, its scope has been consistent with its currently articulated purpose, “to specify the combinations of indoor thermal environmental factors and personal factors that will produce thermal environmental conditions acceptable to a majority of the occupants within the space.”&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"/&gt;  The standard was revised in 2004 after field study results from the ASHRAE research project, RP-884: developing an adaptive model of thermal comfort and preference, indicated that there are differences between naturally and mechanically conditioned spaces with regards to occupant thermal response, change in clothing, availability of control, and shifts in occupant expectations.&lt;ref name="de Dear"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Dear|first=Richard J.|author2=Gail S. Brager|title=Thermal Comfort in Naturally Ventilated Buildings: Revisions to ASHRAE Standard 55.|journal=Energy and Buildings|year=2002|volume=34|issue=6|doi=10.1016/S0378-7788(02)00005-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The addition to the standard, 5.3: Optional Method For Determining Acceptable Thermal Conditions in Naturally Ventilated Spaces, uses an adaptive [[thermal comfort]] approach for naturally conditioned buildings by specifying acceptable operative temperature ranges for naturally conditioned spaces.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"/&gt; As a result, the design of natural ventilation systems became more feasible, which was acknowledged by ASHRAE as a way to further sustainable, energy efficient, and occupant-friendly design.&lt;ref name="ASHRAE Standard 55"/&gt;

'''Needlework Development Scheme''' (NDS) was a collaborative program between industry and art education, that was to encourage and initiate a new standard for British embroidery design in both hand and machine work. The organisation was primarily responsible for developing collections of foreign and British embroidery, that could be loaned to training colleges, [[Women's Institutes]], and schools.&lt;ref name="vam" /&gt;

Started in 1934, the program was originally set up in Scotland by the four Scottish art schools, [[Aberdeen art school|Aberdeen]], [[Dundee art school|Dundee]], [[Edinburgh art school|Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow art school|Glasgow]] under the name '''Needlework Development in Scotland Scheme'''. The project was a collaborative initiated between industry and art education, that was to encourage British embroidery design. The project was sponsored anonymously by thread producers [[Coats PLC|J &amp; P Coats]].&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/n/needlework-development-scheme/ |title=Needlework Development Scheme |publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Politics and trade in design: Emmy Zweybruck-Prochaska's influential textile designs in needlework development scheme collections|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-175632631.html|work=Textile|publisher=Oxford International Publishers Ltd via [[HighBeam Research]] | last=Heffernan | first=Sandra |accessdate=8 May 2012|date=2007-03-22}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1945 the scheme had amassed over 900 embroideries but the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] saw the project disbanded. The Scheme was restated after the war, in 1944, and extended throughout the 1950s to include schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="STHO" /&gt; British artists, including the painter and illustrator [[Mary Kessell]] were speciality commissioned to create experimental designs for the scheme which could then be reinterpreted in embroidery.&lt;ref name="vam" /&gt; The program ended in 1961, having achieved its original aims, and the collection of over 3,500 embroideries, was given to various museums and organisation, including the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London and the [[National Museum of Scotland]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="STHO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scottishtextileheritage.org.uk/theproject/sample_company_history_description.htm |title=Scottish Textiles Heritage Online |publisher=Scottish Textiles Heritage Online |date=2003-07-15 |accessdate=2012-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616160001/http://scottishtextileheritage.org.uk/theProject/sample_company_history_description.htm |archivedate=16 June 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Noise regulation''' includes [[statute]]s or guidelines relating to sound transmission established by national, state or provincial and [[municipal]] levels of government. After the watershed passage of the United States [[Noise Control Act|Noise Control Act of 1972]],&lt;ref name="92-574"&gt;U.S. Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, P.L. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234, {{Usc|42|4901}} - {{Usc|42|4918}}&lt;/ref&gt; other local and state governments passed further regulations.

A noise regulation{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} restricts the amount of noise, the duration of noise and the source of noise. It usually places restrictions for certain times of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kineticsnoise.com/industrial/noise_ordinance.html|title= Noise Ordinance
|publisher= Kinetics Noise Control, Inc|accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]] enacted national laws in 1960 and 1967 respectively, these laws were not at all comprehensive or fully enforceable as to address generally rising ambient noise, enforceable numerical source limits on aircraft and motor vehicles or comprehensive directives to local government.

==History==
[[File:NIOSH Occupational Noise Exposure Criteria Document.jpg|alt=NIOSH Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure|thumb|388x388px|NIOSH Criteria for A Recommended Standard - [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/pdfs/98-126.pdf Occupational Noise Exposure]]]

===United States initial legislation===
In the 1960s and earlier, few people recognized that citizens might be entitled to be protected from adverse sound level exposure.  Most concerted actions consisted of citizens groups organized to oppose a specific highway or airport, and occasionally a [[nuisance]] [[lawsuit]] would arise. Things in the United States changed rapidly with passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1969 and the Noise Pollution and Abatement Act, more commonly called the Noise Control Act (NCA), in 1972. Passage of the NCA was remarkable considering the lack of historic organized citizen concern. However, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] that 30 million Americans are exposed to non-[[occupational]] noise high enough to cause [[hearing loss]] and 44 million Americans live in homes impacted by aircraft or highway noise.&lt;ref&gt;Noise Control Act, Public Law 92-574, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public Law 94-301,1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public law 95-609, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public Law 100-418, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

NEPA requires all federally funded major actions to be analyzed for all physical environmental impacts including [[noise pollution]], and the NCA directed the EPA to promulgate regulations for a host of noise emissions. Many city [[local ordinance|ordinances]] prohibit sound above a threshold intensity from trespassing over property line at night, typically between 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., and during the day restricts it to a higher sound level; however, enforcement is uneven. Many municipalities do not follow up on complaints. Even where a municipality has an enforcement office, it may only be willing to issue warnings, since taking offenders to court is expensive. A notable exception to this rule is the City of [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland, Oregon]], which has instituted an aggressive protection for its citizens with fines reaching as high at $5000 per infraction, with the ability to cite a responsible noise violator multiple times in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;"City of Portland Code and Charter." Title 18, Chapter 18.18 [http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=28714#cid_18511 "Title 18 Noise Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]], employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]'s role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance. The same Act charges the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) with recommending occupational safety and health standards. NIOSH communicates these recommended standards to regulatory agencies (including OSHA) and to others in the occupational safety and health community through the publication and dissemination of Criteria Documents such as the Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/default.html|title=Occupational Noise Exposure|last=NIOSH|first=|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Follow-up on initial U.S. laws===
Initially these laws had a significant effect on thoughtful study of transportation programs and also federally funded [[House|housing]] programs in the United States.  They also gave [[U.S. state|states]] and cities an impetus to consider environmental noise in their [[land use planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] decisions, and led to a host of statutes below the federal level.  Awareness of the need for noise control was rising. In fact, by 1973 a national poll of 60,000 U.S. residents found that sixty percent of people considered street noise to have a "disturbing, harmful or dangerous" impact.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development survey. As reported by Kenneth Eldred at the Fifth International Congress on Noise as an International Problem, Sweden, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend continued strongly throughout the 1970s in the U.S., with about half of the states and hundreds of cities passing substantive noise control laws. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] coordinated all federal noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] phased out the office's funding in 1982 as part of a shift in federal noise control policy to transfer the primary responsibility of regulating noise to state and local governments. However, the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 were never rescinded by Congress and remain in effect today, although essentially unfunded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/history/epa-history-noise-and-noise-control-act|title=EPA History: Noise and the Noise Control Act|last=EPA|first=|date=1982|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) regulates [[aircraft noise]] by specifying the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by "stage" designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 – Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36). The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] also pursues a program of aircraft noise control in cooperation with the aviation community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|last=FAA|first=|date=Jan 9, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) developed noise regulations to control [[Roadway noise|highway noise]] as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. The regulations requires promulgation of traffic noise-level criteria for various land use activities, and describe procedures for the abatement of highway traffic noise and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/noise/|title=Highway Traffic Noise|last=FHWA|first=|date=June 5, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some states continued to act. California carried out an ambitious plan to require its cities to establish a "Noise Element of the General Plan," which provides guidance for land planning decisions to minimize noise impacts on the public.  Many cities throughout the U.S. also have noise ordinances, which specifies the allowable sound level that can cross property lines. These ordinances can be enforced with local [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]s.&lt;ref name="Local ords"&gt;Noise Pollution Clearinghouse, Montpelier, VT. [http://www.nonoise.org/lawlib/cities/cities.htm "Noise Regulations &amp; Ordinances of U.S. Cities, Counties and Towns."] Accessed 2010-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]] actually passed the first national noise control act, but its scope was much more limited than the U.S. law, addressing mainly workplace and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Japan. Ministry of Environment. Law No. 98 of 1968. Latest amendment by Law No. 91 of 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe and Asia===
Several European countries emulated the U.S. national noise control law: Netherlands (1979), France (1985), Spain (1993), and Denmark (1994). In some cases unlegislated innovations have led to quieter products exceeding legal mandates (for example, hybrid vehicles or best available technology in washing machines). [[Environmental noise]] is a special definition in the [[Directive (European Union)|European directive]] 2002/49/EC article 10.1.

==Local noise ordinances in U.S. and Europe==
[[Local ordinance]]s are principally aimed at construction noise, power equipment operated by individuals and unmuffled [[industrial noise]] penetrating residential areas. Thousands of U.S. cities have prepared noise ordinances that give [[noise control]] officers and police the power to investigate noise complaints and enforcement power to abate the offending noise source, through shutdowns and fines.&lt;ref name="Local ords" /&gt; In the 1970s and early 1980s there was even a professional association for noise enforcement officers called NANCO, "National Association of Noise Control Officials."

Today only a handful of properly trained Noise Control Officers remain in the United States. A typical noise ordinance sets forth clear definitions of acoustic nomenclature and defines categories of noise generation; then numerical standards are established, so that enforcement personnel can take the necessary steps of warnings, fines or other municipal police power to rectify unacceptable noise generation.  Ordinances have achieved certain successes but they can be thorny to implement. Many European cities are still treating noise as the U.S. did in the 1960s, as a nuisance and not as a numerical standard to be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* Effects of Noise on Health and Welfare
&lt;ref&gt;Kryter, K.D., "The Effects of Noise on Man”, Academic Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berglund, B, Lindvall, T, Schwela, D. "Guidelines for Community Noise", World Health Organization, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Health and Welfare Criteria for Noise, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,  EPA 550/9-73-002, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information on levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety, US Environmental Agency, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

One obligation of a community is to protect its citizens from adverse environmental influences.  Noise is one of these factors, Noise has documented effects on people, they can be divided into three types.  The first type is a physical effect that directly and adversely effects a person's health. Hearing loss and vibration of bodily components are examples. The second type is a physiological effect that adversely effects a person's health; heightened blood pressure and general stress response are examples.  The third type is psychological that adversely effects a person's welfare; examples are distraction, annoyance, and complaint.
	The only feasible legal basis for a community’s right to control noise is based on these adverse health and welfare effects.  It is clearly easier to uphold the constitutionality of a noise ordinance in a court of law if it can be shown that it is based on health and welfare concerns.  The following is a short list of recognized effects of noise that can be addressed as a reason for a noise ordinance.
:Excess non-Occupational noise exposure, hearing loss on both public and private property, speech interference on both public and private property, audio interference on both public and private property, and sleep interference on mostly private property.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnet, M.H., Arand, D.L., Heart Rate Variability: Sleep Stage, Time of Night, and Arousal Influences" Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Wright State University, and Kettering Medical Center, Dayton, OH, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some legal considerations in the United States===
There are several fundamental issues that shape the legality, effectiveness and enforceability of any community noise regulation.

====Preemption====
The federal government has preempted certain areas of noise regulation. They can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations under the EPA Noise Abatement Programs;&lt;ref&gt;Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40 - Protection of Environment, Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency, Subchapter G - Noise Abatement Programs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?collectionCode=CFR&amp;searchPath=Title+40%2FChapter+I%2FSubchapter+G&amp;granuleId=CFR-2011-title40-vol25-chapI-subchapG&amp;packageId=CFR-2011-title40-vol25&lt;/ref&gt; Parts 201 to 205 and 211 cover railroads, motor carriers in interstate commerce, construction equipment, motor vehicles.  They require product labeling and prohibit tampering with noise control devices.  Communities may enact regulations that are no more strict than the federal ones so that local enforcement can be carried out.  They can enact curfews and restrict vehicle use in established zones such as residential.  Any restriction on interstate motor carriers or railroads may NOT be for the purpose of noise control.
States have police powers granted by the Constitution.  They may also enact regulations that are no more strict than federal regulations. They may also preempt local ordinances.  California &lt;ref&gt;California Health and Safety Code 46000-46080&lt;/ref&gt; and New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;NJAC 7:29&lt;/ref&gt; have comprehensive noise codes that communities must meet. Many states required that local ordinances be no more strict than the state code whether such code exists or not.  One relatively common preemption is protection of shooting ranges from noise regulation or litigation&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Revised Statutes, Chapter 17-602&lt;/ref&gt; and right to farm laws that protect agricultural areas from nuisance litigation by encroaching residential areas.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Right to Farm Act Article, pp.823-14{{Clarify pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutional vagueness====
In one case, the United States Supreme Court has said [[Void for vagueness]]
“It is a basic principle of due process (Amendment V) that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing ''fair warning''.  Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.  A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of ''arbitrary and discriminatory application''.  Third, but related, where a vague statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms. (the chilling effect).  In one case,&lt;ref&gt;State of New Jersey vs. Clarksburg Inn, 375 N.J. Super. 624, 868 A.2s 112, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the court declared that numerical sound levels were constitutional as well as the term ''plainly audible'' provided it was associated with a reasonable distance. Two requirements for a noise ordinance provision is that:
#provide fair warning
#avoid the possibility of arbitrary enforcement

====Free Speech====
Examples are: slander, hate speech, and [[Shouting fire in a crowded theater|falsely calling "fire" in an assembly]]. Generally, the time, place, or manner of restrictions must:
#be content neutral
#be narrowly tailored
#serve a significant government interest
#leave open alternative channels of communication
One example&lt;ref&gt;Madsen vs. Women's Health Center&lt;/ref&gt; concerned protesters outside an abortion clinic.  The US Supreme Court stated that limitations placed on noise making were necessary to ensure the well-being of patients.

====Overbreadth====
The US Supreme Court has addressed the issue of too much regulation by defining overbreadth as: ''A clear, precise enactment may nevertheless be overbroad if, in its reach, it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.'' One means to avoid being overbroad is by having provisions that are specific so that potential violators are given fair warning of what is prohibited. In one case &lt;ref&gt;Grayned vs. City of Rockford, 408 US 104 (19720&lt;/ref&gt; the court ruled that the specificity of the city ordinance (Section 17-35) regulating school verbal protests was not ''constitutionally vague'', gave ''fair warning'', and was not an invitation to arbitrary enforcement and so was not overbroad, despite the implied limitation on free speech.

====Nuisance====
Nuisances are part of tort law. Torts are civil wrongs whether intentional or accidental from which injury occurs to another. Nuisances can be public or private.  A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public while a private nuisance is an interference with a person's enjoyment and use of his land. [[Black's Law Dictionary]] defines a nuisance as''... that which annoys and disturbs one in possession of his property, rendering its ordinary use and occupation physically uncomfortable to him.''  It defines a private nuisance as:..''anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another.  As distinguished from public nuisance, it includes any wrongful act which destroys or deteriorates the property of an individual or of a few persons or interferes with their lawful use or enjoyment thereof, or any act which unlawfully hinders them in the enjoyment of a common or public right and causes them a special injury different from that sustained by the general public.'' The word ''nuisance'' is connected closely with the word ''disturbance'' which is used extensively in many noise ordinances. A definition below further restricts the meaning to ''noise disturbance''.  Nuisance law applies to both community noise regulation as well as private suits brought to court to reduce noise impact.

====Enforceability====
Care must be taken in writing a ''subjective'' noise provision so that it overcomes the objections listed above. Care must be taken when writing an ''objective'' noise provision to make sure that the sound levels are physically realizable.  For example, requiring the maximum sound level of an automobile to be 40&amp;nbsp;dB(A) or the maximum sound level in a residential zone to be 30&amp;nbsp;dB(A) opens the provision to an enforceability challenge

====Confiscation====
Confiscation is the taking of private property for public use without compensation. It may occur legally when the government seizes property used in illegal practices.    Confiscation may occur without an arrest of a person because it is seen as an arrest of property, rather than a person, and the necessity of finding a party guilty is not required in all cases. In many cases, the guilt or innocence of the property owner is irrelevant and the government need not prove anything ''beyond a reasonable doubt''. In order to seize property, there must be either a warrant or a showing of probable cause. The mere showing of probable cause to support the forfeiture of an individual’s property has been a controversial issue. Court opinion varies, but probable cause most often means that the government need only demonstrate reasonable grounds for the belief that the property is properly subject to forfeiture, which can be supported by something less than prima facie proof, but more than mere suspicion. The Peoria, Illinois noise ordinance (Sections 15-75 and 15-77) allows confiscation of vehicles that emit excessive sound caused by sound producing devices. Colorado Springs, Colorado (Section 9.8.102) permits confiscation of sound producing devices.

===Four Types of Noise Regulation===
&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fixed sound sources must be treated differently than moving sources.  In the former case, the listener is normally defined while for moving sources it is not.  Historically, regulations were enforced by the subjective judgment of an enforcing officer.  With the advent of sound measuring equipment, the judgment can be based on measured sound levels. Most comprehensive noise ordinances contain four types of provisions.

'''Subjective Emission'''
These regulations allow an official to ''decide'' if the output of a sound source is acceptable ''without'' recourse to sound measurements and without regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with ''plainly audible'' terms on public property as a criterion are examples.

'''Subjective Immission'''
These regulations allow an official to ''decide'' if the sound received by a listener is acceptable ''without'' recourse to sound measurements and without regard for the specific sound power generated by the source.. Regulations with ''plainly audible'' or ''noise disturbance'' terms on private property as a criterion are examples.

'''Objective Emission'''
These regulations require an official to ''measure'' the output of a sound source to determine whether it is acceptable ''without'' regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with specific maximum sound output levels for motor vehicles are examples.

'''Objective Immission'''
These regulations require an official to ''measure'' the sound received by a listener to determine whether it is acceptable ''without'' regard to the specific sound power generated by the source.  Regulations with maximum allowable sound levels on property lines are examples

===Some Definitions used in the United States===
many communities have definitions that are local to them, such as those defining motor vehicles and sound levels and sound level  measurements.  Some that have been added to make noise enforcement more specific are listed here.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Engine Braking Device====
A compression braking device installed on large motor vehicles to assist in reduction, or control, of vehicle speed.  When activated, the engine converts from a power source to a power absorber by converting the engine into an air compressor.

====Muffler====
Any device for the abatement of sound emission while permitting the transfer of gas.  A muffler is considered to be in good working order if the sound reduction is equal to, or greater than, that of the original equipment.

====Noise Disturbance====
Any sound or vibration which:
# may disturb or annoy reasonable persons of normal sensitivities or;
# causes, or tends to cause, an adverse effect on the public health and welfare or;
# endangers or injures people or;
# endangers or injures personal or real property.
This can also be defined as ''noise nuisance''.

====Place of Public Entertainment====
Any location, exterior, or interior, to a building that regularly permits public entrance for entertainment purposes.  For this purpose, “public” means citizens of all types, including but not limited to, children, and private or public employees.

====Plainly Audible Sound====
Any sound for which the information content is unambiguously communicated to the listener, such as, but not limited to, understandable speech, comprehension of whether a voice is raised or normal, repetitive bass sounds, or comprehension of musical rhythms, without the aid of any listening device.

====Powered Model Vehicle====
Any self-propelled airborne, water-borne, or land-borne, plane, vessel, or vehicle, which is not designed to carry persons, including, but not limited to, any model airplane, boat, car, or rocket.

====Real Property Boundary====
An imaginary line along the ground surface, and its vertical extension, which separates the real property owned by one person from that owned by another person, but not including intra-building real property divisions.

====Sound Reproduction Device====
Any device, instrument, mechanism, equipment or apparatus for the amplification of any sounds from any radio, phonograph, stereo, tape player, musical instrument, television, loudspeaker or other sound-making or sound-producing device or any device or apparatus for the reproduction or amplification of the human voice or other sound.

====Vibration Perception Threshold====
The minimum ground or structure borne vibrational motion necessary to cause a person of normal sensitivity to be aware of the motion through contact, hearing, or through visual observation of moving things.

===Ordinance Provisions for Stationary Sources in the United States===
there are three levels of regulation for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad ''subjective immission'' control that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an ''objective immission'' control that uses specific levels of sound considered to be a noise disturbance.  Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum Permissible Sound Levels below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation.  The concept that a potential violator should have ''fair warning'' that his actions are in violation has led to provisions that address specific noise problems.  The sections below list those that are found in community noise ordinances.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Air Conditioning, Heating and Pool Equipment====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  An evaluation of the noise disturbance is made at the listener without a sound level meter. This provision is mostly applied in residential zones such as homes, apartments and condominiums.  Albuquerque, NM (Article 9-9) requires that such units the maximum permissible sound levels (Se section below) and recommend that those units be placed away from other residential units or on roof tops to diminish impact.

====Airport and Airport Operations====
Community control of airport created noise is limited to those sounds ''not'' related to flight operations.  The community is able to control the land use around the airport however.

====Animals====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  Most relate to barking dogs and put an upper time limit for continuous sound from them.  New Jersey (Chapter 13:1G) considers a violation if the sound is continuous for more than 5 minutes or intermittent for more than 20 minutes.  They also consider it a defense to violation if the animal is provoked to bark. Connecticut (Chapter 442)exempts animal sounds while Anchorage, AK (Chapter 15.70) requires that continual violations permit the animal to be taken and put out for adoption.

====Authorized Outdoor Discharge of Firearms and Shooting Ranges====
This provision contains only a curfew since most states protect shooting ranges from liability for noise disturbance.  It can include a curfew requirement and a requirement for a public hearing if expansion of the range is desired.  The provision may prohibit other weapons such as rocket propelled projectiles but may exempt unpowered weapons such as arrows. South Carolina (title 31 Chapter 18) requires that a sign stating '''SHOOTING RANGE-NOISE AREA''' be placed on all primary roads. Arizona (ARS 17-602) places a curfew from 10pm to 7 am.  It also allows a tradeoff between the number of events and the maximum permitted sound level. New York (Chapter 150) also trades off overall levels with the duration of the sounds. Colorado (Article 25-12-109) declared that noise restrictions on shooting ranges is a detriment to public health, welfare, and morale.

====Condominiums and Apartments====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It is designed to limit the noise disturbance between living units as defined by an enforcement official.  One criterion used to evaluate that disturbance is use of ''plainly audible'' but at the location of the listener instead of at a specific distance.  However, Charlotte, NC (Sec. 15-69) limits indoor levels to 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A) be tween 9am to 9pm and 5&amp;nbsp;dB less at other times, but only from sound reproducing devices. Salt Lake Valley Health Department (Chapter 4), Minneapolis, MN (Chapter 389), and Albuquerque, NM (Article 9) use levels to existing ambient to define a violation. Albuquerque NM and Omaha, NE (Chapter 17) require that intruding sounds not be audible. Burlington, VT (Chapter 18) requires that renters be supplied with the city noise ordinance.

====Construction====
This provision can be both a ''subjective immission'' control and an ''objective emission'' control. Normally there are daily curfews and in some case weekend curfews.  The subjective aspect is to prevent noise disturbance in the adjacent community.  The objective aspect is to control the sound output of specific machines.  There are four major sources of site noise: (1) direct sound from continually operating equipment such as air compressors; (2) intermittent sound from equipment such as jack hammers;(3)backup alarms; and (4) hauling equipment such as trucks. Air compressor noise is regulated by CFR 204 and backup alarms are regulated by CFR 1926.  Boston, MA(Section 16-26.4)  permits construction on weekdays between 7am and 6 pm. Madison, WI (Chapter 24.08) limits sound levels to 88&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 Feet. Miami, FL (Section 36-6) considers the noise a noise disturbance if it occurs between 6pm and 8am during the week and any time on Sunday. Dallas, TX (Section 30-2 (9)) permits construction in residential zones from 7am to 7pm on weekdays, from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays and Holidays, and prohibits construction on Sundays.  Albuquerque, New Mexico (Section 9-9-8) has a more complex control. It prohibits construction and demolition within 500 feet of noise sensitive properties (residences included) if the equipment sound control devices are less effective than the original equipment and if noise mitigation measures are not used when the levels exceed 90&amp;nbsp;dB (weighting not specified) or more than 80&amp;nbsp;dB during the day for three days.

====Domestic and Commercial Power Tools====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It is used in residential zones as well as in commercial areas abutting residential zones.  Portland, OR (Title 18.10.030) has several ways to handle these tools. They separate ''outdoor'' and ''indoor'' use to different maximum levels at the property line. They have a night curfew and separate 5 HP tools from higher powered tools.  Madison WI (Chapter 24.08) has similar HP restrictions.  Albuquerque, NM (Title 9-9-7) restricts locations to more than 500 feet from residential and noise sensitive zones. Dallas, TX(Sec. 30-2) exempts lawn maintenance tools during daylight hours. Green Bay, WI (Subchapter II – 27.201) exempts snow removal tools.

====Explosives, Firearms, Impulsive Sources, and Similar Devices====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It is for impulsive sound sources that are not associated with construction activities or shooting ranges. Many communities use the Maximum Permissible Sound Levels criterion (see below), with a correction for the character of the sound. Illinois () sets maximum blasting levels by land use zone and in three time categories. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.010.F) limits levels to 100&amp;nbsp;dB (peak) from 7am to 10pm and 80&amp;nbsp;dB (peak) from 10pm to 7 am.

====Fracking Operations====
Hydraulic Fracturing operations generate site sound as well as vehicle sound and several different provisions are required to control it.  Federal law regulates the levels of certain site machinery.  A ''subjective immission'' control or an ''objective immission'' control can be applied to surrounding neighborhoods. See maximum Permissible Sound Levels.  Motor vehicle sound is mostly off-site so vehicle noise regulations are applicable. See Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-way.
The State of New York has announced a statewide ban on such operations. Buffalo, NY and Pittsburgh, PA have announced a ban.  Colorado has numerous activities to stop fracking.

====Funerals====
This is a ''subjective emission'' control to reduce the excessive shouting and protests that can surround funeral proceedings.  It makes use of the ''plainly audible'' term and so adds a distance criterion.  There are certain groups, particularly those that object to involvement in foreign wars, who believe it is an obligation to disrupt and picket funerals, especially those of deceased military veterans.  This provision must not infringe on Constitutionally protected free speech. Illinois h(720 ILCS 5/26 6)has a comprehensive provision covering more aspects of this event than noise.  They failed to use “plainly audible” which is narrower than “audible”.  Utah(Section 76-9-108) restricts disruptive activity to beyond 200 feet.

====Loading and Unloading Operations====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  Operations in commercial facilities can impact adjacent residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.03) places a curfew on such operations between 10pm and 7am but only if the source is within 200 feet of a residence. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2830) permits night operations unless they create a noise disturbance. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.6) prohibits noise disturbance between 7pm and 7am.

====Maximum Permissible Sound Pressure Levels====
This provision is an ''objective immission'' control.  It requires the measurement of sound levels at or beyond a property line and its vertical extension. There are several methods for implementing such a provision:
# It may not permit any exceedence or may permit exceedence only for a percentage of the measurement period. 
# It may require the measurement method to be instantaneous, such as dB(A) or time-averaged, such as Energy Equivalent Level (Leq).
# It may be a fixed level limit, such as 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A), or it may be a level relative to the ambient sound, such as 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) above the ambient.
# It may require measurement of the frequency spectrum, such as one octave bands, or A-weighting, such as dB(A).
# It may define different maximum levels based on zoning criteria, such as residential, commercial, or industrial.
# It may define different maximum levels based on time-of-day or day-of-week, such as reduced maxima during night hours or on weekends.
# It may require reduction of maximum levels based on the character of the sound, such as intermittent or impulsive.
# It may exempt certain classes of sound sources, such as shooting ranges, farm equipment, emergency equipment, railroads, or licensed activities.
most noise ordinances set maximum levels for two time periods: Day (7am to 10pm) and Night (10pm to 7am).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }} Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt; San Diego (Article 9.25)sets three periods:  Day (7am to 7pm), Evening (7pm to 10pm), and Night (10pm to 7am) and exempts industrial zones from time based restrictions.  Seattle, WA (Chapter 25.08) sets two time periods but changes 7am to 9am on weekends and holidays.  Several states have maximum permissible land use sound levels in dB(A). Most have Day and Night periods and three use categories: residential, Commercial and Industrial. Washington{{vague|state? D.C.?|date=September 2015}} (Chapter 70.107) sets maximum levels in dB(A) but allows 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) more if the sound is only 15 minutes in an hour, or 10&amp;nbsp;dB(A) for 5 minutes in an hour.  Numerous cities have fixed levels, permitting excess levels for short times (e.g., Dallas, TX, Chapter 30) while others use Leq (Lincoln, NE, Chapter 8.24). Los Angeles, CA (Chapter XI) uses a relative level with a stated but ''presumed'' ambient.  New York City, NY (Chapter 19) requires Leq measurements to be made over one hour.  Atlanta, GA (){{vague|"()"|date=September 2015}} limits impulsive sound to 100&amp;nbsp;dB(C) at property lines, while most reduce the maximum level by 5&amp;nbsp;dB for pure tones and impulsive sounds.

====Motor Vehicle or Motorboat Repairs and Testing====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  If the activity is done in a residential zone, the Domestic Tools provision can be applied for the repairs, but this provision also is used for the testing phase of any repairs. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.01) covers this violation in three ways.  The first is application of the ''noise disturbance'' provision in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am.  The second is being ''plainly audible'' at a distance of 150 feet or more in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am.  The third is exceeding the presumed ambient by 5&amp;nbsp;dB.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.7) prohibits this activity as a ''noise disturbance'' at any time.

====Noise Disturbance Prohibited====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. This provision is generic in that it covers all events that are considered disturbing by a listener, with or without measurement.  The strength of this provision is that it covers situations not contemplated in a noise ordinance and can be used as backup for more specific provisions. The weakness is that it may not give ''fair warning'', may lead to arbitrary enforcement on the part of the regulator, or permit unreasonable demands by a listener.

====Noise Sensitive Zones====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  It is used to reduce levels of both stationary and vehicular sound sources around hospitals, schools, and other noise sensitive locations.  To provide ''fair warning'' visible signs must be posted.  It is possible to have an extensive list. For example, if churches are on the list and the community has many of them, signage, compliance, and enforcement can be a problem. In modern hospital environments, helicopter sound is exempt.

====Places of Public Entertainment====
This provision is an ''objective immision '' control.  It regulates the site of the sound source while the Sound Reproduction Devices section regulates the devices that create the sound.  It can regulate the sound levels received by ''involuntary'' listeners in the surrounding community as well as the sound levels received by ''voluntary'' listeners.  If the latter aspect is incorporated, limiting internal sound levels often resolves community noise impact. Los Angeles (Article 2, Section 112.06)requires warning signs and limits noise exposure to 95&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at any position normally occupied. Seattle, WA {Section 25.08.501} considers the sound emitted to be in violation if the sound is ''plainly audible'' within a dwelling from 10 pm to 7am; the need for a sound level meter is avoided. Chicago, IL {Section 11-4-2805} limits received sound levels to 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A) inside a residential dwelling unit but if the ambient is greater, the limit is 65&amp;nbsp;dB(A).  If outdoors, the limit is ''conversational level'' at 100 feet from the property line.  If the building is set back 20 feet from the property line, the allowable level is 84&amp;nbsp;dB(A)!  Both of Chicago’s limits apply from 10 pm to 8 am.  Salt Lake health Department, UT {Section 4.5.11.(vii)} sets the limit at 95&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at a position that would normally be occupied by a patron and 100&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at other positions. They also require a sign stating '''WARNING: SOUND LEVELS ON THIS PREMISE &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; MAY CAUSE PERMANENT HEARING DAMAGE. HEARING PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE'''.   Anchorage, AK (Section 15.70.060.B.12) sets maximum levels for any patron at 90&amp;nbsp;dB(A).

====Powered Unmanned Vehicles or Engines====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It has been used to regulate the sound of model aircraft on both private and public property.  It applies to airborne, water-borne, and land-borne, unmanned vehicles.  It makes no distinction between model vehicles and full-size unmanned vehicles.  it applies also to the engines of those vehicles. Most regulations pertained to private unmanned vehicles, normally restricted to local open fields.  The development of drones with microphones, cameras and GPS has opened the door to commercial use over wider private and public properties.  Since federal preemption of drone use will likely occur, it is important for this provision to make the distinction. Salt Lake Health Department (Section 4.5.15) limits activity to 800 feet from a dwelling between 10 pm and 7 am, or if it cases a noise disturbance. Atlanta, GA (Section 74-136(b)) uses the ''plainly audible'' criterion across a residential property line, on a public property from 10 pm to 7 am on weekdays or from 10 pm to 10 am on weekends or holidays for any sound source.

====Propane Cannons====
This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. A propane cannon is used to keep animals and birds from destroying commercial crops.  In large fields, many are used and fired as frequent intervals. The sound levels are equivalent to the firing of a small artillery cannon.  The provision may contain requirements that limit the number of cannons permitted in a specific area and the number firings per hour for each cannon.  many states have a Right to Farm Act that limits nuisance litigation.  Florida() stated that it was a purpose of their act to protect reasonable agricultural activities conducted on farm land from nuisance suits.  They also added a section that limited expand of operations without consideration of noise. Fairfax County, VA (Sections 105-4-4 and 108-5-1) require agricultural operation to meet maximum land use regulations and prohibit unnecessary noise.  British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture (Farm Nuisance Noise document) have developed a comprehensive set of rules for cannon use.

====Public Address Systems====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It can contain a ''plainly audible'' term or a curfew.  It is applied to commercial facilities using a sound system to ''deliberately'' propagate mostly speech, but also music.  Most cities have provisions relevant to this subject.  Lakewood, CO (Sections 9.52.06 and 09.52.160) used ''plainly audible'' as a regulatory tool and prohibits the sounding of bells, or chimes from 10pm to 7am.  Charlotte, NC (Section 15-69(a)(4)) limits levels to 60&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet from 9am to 9pm and 50&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at other times. Indianapolis, IN (Section 391-505) addresses broadcasts from aircraft. Connecticut (Section 22a-69-1.7) exempts bells, carillons, and chimes from religious facilities.

====Sound Reproduction Devices====
This provision is ''subjective immission'' control. It may contain a numerical level or a ''plainly audible'' term and a curfew. it is applied to specific sources of sound as opposed to any location at which the sound is created. It is applied primarily to ''amplified'' sound sources.  Older provisions listed several items such as televisions, phonographs, etc.  Changing the title to the above  addresses the real issue and allows for novel sound production devices.  Numerous communities have provisions for these devices; many use ''plainly audible'' as the criterion, such as Omaha, NE (Section 17-3) and Buffalo NY (Section 293-4)

====Stadiums and Outdoor Music Festivals====
This provision can be either a ''subjective or objective immission'' control with a curfew.  The subjective aspect relates to noise disturbance in the local community.  The objective aspect limits the acceptable sound level in the local community.  Illinois (Environmental Protection Act 415.25) exempts certain stadiums and exempts festivals, parades, or street fairs. Colorado Spring, CO (Section 9.8.101)  has similar exemptions, but limits the sound levels to 80&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at residential locations.

====Stationary Emergency Signaling Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control with a list of devices that are exempt. It can have a term that limits the time periods in which emergency alarms may be tested. It can have a term that limits the activation time of burglar or fire alarms.  Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2815) limits the time for tests to 4 minutes between 9am and 5pm. Oregon (Chapter 467) prohibits sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary.

====Stationary non-Emergency non-Safety Signaling Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control that limits the activation period of alarms and restricts activation to a specific time-of-day or day-of-week. Los Angeles, CA () prohibits the sounding if the signal can be heard at 200 feet or more. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2820) considers the sound to be a noise disturbance in residential areas if the sound exceeds 5 minutes in any hour; steam whistles are exempt.  Albuquerque, NM (Section 9-9-12) restricts levels to 5&amp;nbsp;dB over the ambient at a property line and applies maximum permissible residential level as well as ''plainly audible'' restrictions at night.

====Street Sales====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. Boston, MA (Section 16-2.2) prohibits street sales near schools or churches if there is a “disturbance of the peace”.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.4) places a curfew between 6 pm and 9 am.

====Tampering====
This provision prevents the modification of muffling devices that increase the emitted sound. It can also be used to prevent the commercial sale of such mufflers.  Most states and communities have prohibitions on tampering with noise reduction devices. whether stationary or moving.  Salt Lake County health Department (Section 4.5.10) prohibits modifications of mufflers that increase sound levels and prohibits tampering with noise rating labels.  See Section below on Adequate Mufflers.

====Vibration====
This provision is a ''subjective emission'' control.  Noise disturbance caused by vibration comes in three forms.  One is contact with vibrating surfaces, the second in auditory, and the third is the observation of surrounding objects movement.  Objectively regulating vibration is difficult so this provision makes use of the Vibration Perception Threshold.  Railroad caused vibration is preempted by federal law (CFR 201). Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2910) uses the perception threshold method.   Dallas, TX requires measurement of low frequency vibration.  Maryland uses the definition of ''noise'' to include sound and vibration at sub-audible frequencies.

====Wind Turbines====
The sound created by wind turbines is caused by the blade rotation similar to aircraft propellers.  Because the rotation rate is low, the frequency is also low, but the large size of many can result in disturbing sound levels, particularly in high wind areas.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, A.L., Manwell, G.F., Wright, S. "Wind Turbine Acoustic Noise", University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Most local control is done by advantageous site planning.  New Hampshire (Title LXIV, Section 674:63) sets a sound level limit of 55&amp;nbsp;dB when measured at the site property line, allowing for exceptional events, such as storms. Studies have declared that wind noise can have a negative effect on health.&lt;ref&gt;Anon, "Public Health Effects of Wind Turbines", Minnesota Department of Health, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinance Provisions for Moving Vehicles in the United States===
Stationary sources have fixed positions, so it is possible to define the listeners and therefore ''immission'' controls are appropriate.  Motor vehicles are moving sources so it is not possible to define any specific listeners so ''emission'' controls are appropriate.  There are exceptions to this distinction. Construction equipment, and some recreation vehicles, move within a bounded area and can be considered to be time varying fixed sources. Standing motor vehicles can radiate sufficient sound to create noise disturbance.  These must be treated by specific provisions.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Adequate Mufflers or Sound Dissipation Devices====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control.  Unlike the Tampering provision, this is specific to motor vehicles.  It requires that a vehicle muffler not create more sound than the original equipment which has been measured.  It prohibits any modification or replacement that increases the sound emission beyond that of the original equipment. It prohibits the sale of mufflers that do not meet original equipment standards.  Many states have requirements that a muffler ''shall be in good working order'' which is not specific enough.  California (Section 27150.1)) requires that a retail seller that sells a product in violation of the muffler regulation  must install a replacement muffler that meets the regulation and must reimburse the purchaser for the expense of replacement.

====Airboats and Hovercraft====
This provision is both an "objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control.  It can set a maximum sound level at a specified distance (typically 50 feet). It can have a curfew.  It can be based on ''noise disturbance'' in the community.  It can also require the use of ear protectors on passengers. Unlike motorboats, the sound generators on these vehicles are airborne, resulting in more noise impact.  Florida (Section 327.65) requires a maximum level of 90 DB(A).  Maine (Title 12 Section 13068-A)has three levels: operating, operating test and stationary test

====Engine Braking Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control. It can restrict brake use for only safety purposes and by defining restricted areas.  It can require that mufflers be maintained to keep emitted sound to that of the original equipment.  Common terminology is '''Jake brakes''' after the Jacobs Company. Milwaukee, Wi (Section 80-69) prohibits use within city limits.  Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.B.3) prohibits use within 200 feet of a residence.  Albuquerque, NM posts signs requiring proper mufflers.

====Motorboats====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control.
Because they are moving sources, ''objective'' controls are appropriate for measurements on open waterways.  Many motorboats operate in bounding areas, such as small lakes or canals, with adjacent residential areas.  In this case, ''immission'' controls are appropriate. California (Section 654.05), Portland OR (Section 18.10.040), and Seattle, WA (Section 25.08.485) require ''immission'' measurements to be made at the shoreline. Many states require ''emission'' measurements to be made at 50 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Horns or Signaling Devices====
This provision is both a prohibition and an ''emission'' control. it limits to use for safety warning only..  It limits the sound level to a specific level at a prescribed distance.  This provision is intended to limit horn use to safety and to limit the use of excessively loud air horns or ''Rumbler'' or ''Howler'' horns. California prohibits a person operating a motor vehicle to wear a headset or earplugs on both ears. . Oregon (Section 820.370) prohibits signaling sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary or returning from an emergency

====Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-Way====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control. It applies maximum sound levels to various categories of moving vehicles and for several vehicle speeds.  It is the backbone of vehicle sound emission regulations. It generally requires a measurement of A-weighted sound level of a moving vehicle at a specific distance from the vehicle path (normally 50 feet).  This provision has level restrictions on trucks over 10,000 GVW used locally and in interstate commerce.  It also covers motorcycles of two horsepower ratings, mopeds, and all other vehicles on public rights-of-way.  The federal government has set maximum levels for heavy trucks used in interstate commerce (40 CFR 202)and for motorcycles (40 CFR 205).  Most states and many cities  have maximum limits and they generally agree with federal standards where they apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }} Appendix B&lt;/ref&gt; The most common speed division is 35&amp;nbsp;mph.

====Motor Vehicle Racing Events====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control. It can define the method of vehicle operation that is used to define the maximum permitted sound level.  It can have a curfew.  Some states exempt motor vehicle racing events from noise disturbance litigation or prosecution.  Arizona (Section 28-955.03) exempts racing motorcycles from maximum sound levels and muffler requirements. Illinois {Section 35.903} had detailed regulations on racing vehicles It required a 14&amp;nbsp;dB reduction in sound output, limited sound output at half mater to 115&amp;nbsp;dB(A), and no more than 105&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Sound systems====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control, a ''subjective emission'' control, and a ''subjective immission'' for vehicles on a public right-of-way.  The first part limits the system sound level at a fixed distance. The second part uses the ''plainly audible'' definition for limiting the sound output.  The third part uses the ''noise disturbance'' definition to limit the impact on neighboring properties and can be applied within public transportation. The most restrictive application of the plainly audible laws says that the sound cannot be audible to anyone other than the vehicle occupants.  There are numerous state and community restrictions on vehicle sound systems. Louisiana prohibits the system from emitting sound outside of a vehicle.  Richmond, CA also prohibits the sound from being audible outside the vehicle.  Oregon prohibits sound systems being ''plainly audible'' at 50 feet. California prohibits sound systems that can be ''heard'' at 50 feet. Colorado Springs, CO, requires a measurement at 25 feet beyond the private property line or 25 feet from the source on public property; it does not specify a limiting level.  In Lakewood, CO it must not be ''plainly audible'' beyond 25 feet.  In Los Angeles, CA, it cannot be audible beyond 200 feet.  In Seattle, WA, it must not be ''plainly audible'' at 75 feet. Chicago restricts levels to less than ''clearly audible'' at 75 feet. Minneapolis, MN restricts levels to less than audible at 50 feet. Albuquerque, NM restricts ''plainly audible'' to 25 feet, but also applies their land use limits.  Cincinnati, OH restricts ''plainly audible'' to 50 feet.  Dallas, TX prohibits sound or vibration that is detectable at 30 feet, or that violates the land use regulations.  Houston, TX applies land use restrictions. Omaha, NE states the sound must not be audible at 100 feet.  Hammond, IN restricts ''plainly audible'' to 25 feet. New Jersey states the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' at 50 feet between 8 am and 10 pm and not ''plainly audible'' at 25 feet between 10 pm and 8 am.  Florida states the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' at 25 feet, but exempts business and political systems.  Oregon and Tennessee state that the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' beyond 50 feet, as does Fairbanks, AK. Rhode Island specifically addresses low frequency sound that can be heard 20 feet from a closed vehicle or 100 feet otherwise.  Salt Lake County Health Department, UT considers the sound a violation if it is ''plainly audible'' on a common carrier. Austin, TX states it must not be audible at 30 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Theft Alarms====
This provision is a ''subjective emission'' control with only an operational time limit. Los Angeles, CA () requires silencing in 5 minutes.  New York City, NY (Section 24.221(d)) requires automatic shut-off after 10 minutes and a prominent display of the local precinct number and telephone number.  Boston, MA (Section 16-26.2) considers it a violation if the alarm is plainly audible at 200 feet and is on more than 5 minutes.  Other states an communities have automatic shutoff times from 10 to 15 minutes.  Some communities have banned such alarms.

====Motor Vehicle Tire Squeal and Street Drag Racing====
This provision is  a ''subjective immission'' control. It is based on the ''noise disturbance'' from drag racing and tire squealing on public rights-of-way.  Illinois (625 ILCS 5/11-505) prohibits such activities.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.14) prohibits such activity if it creates a ''noise disturbance''.

====Railroads====
Railroad activity is subject to federal regulations. Most communities do not attempt to regulate train sound.  The level of train horns permitted by the Federal Railroad Administration sufficiently high that community impact occurs. One method to alleviate this sound is to have a community establish a '''quiet zone''' where the rail crossings meet federal safety standards so that horn use is not needed.

====Recreational Off-road Vehicles====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties.  Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an ''objective'' control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance, is appropriate.  Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a ''subjective'' control is appropriate. Numerous states and cities have ''emission'' controls measured at 50 feet;  the most common level is 82&amp;nbsp;dB(A), which is similar to that for motor vehicles on public rights-of-way.  Colorado Springs, CO (Section 9.8.204.C) requires a minimum distance of 660 feet from residences. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.C) requires the area must be designated for recreational vehicle use.  Salt Lake health Department, UT (Section 4.5.10(x)) requires off-highway vehicles to be at least 800 feet from a dwelling during the day and has a curfew from 10 pm to 7 am.  They prohibit any ''noise disturbance'' and require sound levels to the less than 96&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet.

====Recreational Snowmobiles====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties.  Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an ''objective'' control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance is appropriate.  Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a ''subjective'' control is appropriate.  Numerous states and communities have ''objective'' controls; the most common maximum level is 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A). Federal law (36 CFR 2.18) regulates snowmobiles on federal property at 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A), so states and communities are free to regulate snowmobile sound levels on their property. Lincoln NE (Section 8.24.110) limits levels to 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A).	Maine (Section 13112, Chapter 937) exempts snowmobiles at sanctioned racing events.  Illinois (625 ILCS 40 Sec. 4-4)does also.

====Refuse Collection Vehicles====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective'' control. It can place a maximum sound level at a specific distance for the loudest operation.  It can set a curfew, or it can be based on ''noise disturbance'' in residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 113.01) has a time limit that applies only within 200 feet of any residential building.  Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2900) considers any noise it a noise disturbance if the activity occurs between 8pm to 8am.  Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.6) considers it a noise disturbance if the activities occur between 10 pm to 7 am and closer than 800 feet from a dwelling.   Atlanta, GA (Section 74-137(a)(5)prohibits collection between 9pm and am on a weekend day or legal holiday, except by permit. In Maryland, refuse collection is exempt during daytime hours and must meet maximum land use levels [55&amp;nbsp;dB(A)] in residential zones at  night.

====Standing Motor Vehicles====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It sets a time limit on engine activity. It can also place a curfew on any engine activity. e. In Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.10(xi)) it is considered a ''noise disturbance'' if the operation lasts more than 15 minutes.  Dallas, TX (Section 30-3.1) applies the code to vehicles over 14,000 GVWR; they must be more than 300 feet from a residential zone and there is a 10-minute maximum.  They also provide a list of idling vehicles that are exempt from prosecution such as buses or active concrete trucks.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.10) limits operation to 3 minutes in an hour for vehicles over 14,000 GVWR in either public or private property. It exempts buses and taxis. Massachusetts allows idling no more than 5 minutes.

==Building codes==
In the case of construction of new (or remodeled) apartments, condominiums, hospitals and hotels, many U.S. states and cities have stringent [[building code]]s with requirements of acoustical analysis, in order to protect building occupants from exterior noise sources and sound generated within the building itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Noise Control Manual for Residential Buildings |last=Harris |first=David A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-026942-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard required for exterior building skin design.

The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 [[decibel|dB]]).  The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: [[insulated glazing|glazing]] (glass thickness, double pane design, etc.), roof material, caulking standards, chimney baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, attic ventilation ports and mounting of through the wall air conditioners.  A special case of building skin design arises in the case of [[aircraft noise]], where the FAA has funded extensive work in residential retrofit.

Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal types of transmission. First, airborne sound travels through walls or floor/ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems.  Human activities might include voice, amplified sound systems or  animal noise.  Mechanical systems are elevator systems, [[boiler]]s, [[refrigeration]] or [[air conditioning]] systems, [[Electrical generator|generator]]s and trash compactors.  Since many of these sounds are inherently loud, the principle of regulation is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards (typically Sound Transmission Class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.

The second type of interior sound is called [[Impact insulation class|Impact Insulation Class]] (IIC) transmission.  This effect arises not from airborne transmission, but rather from transmission of sound through the building itself.  The most common perception of IIC noise is from footfall of occupants in living spaces above.  This type of noise is somewhat more difficult to abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling on resilient channel.  Commonly a performance standard of IIC equal to 50 is specified in building codes.  California has generally led the U.S. in widespread application of building code requirements for sound transmission; accordingly, the level of protection for building occupants has increased markedly in the last several decades.

==U.S. occupational safety regulations==
The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established maximum noise levels for occupational exposure, beyond which mitigation measures or [[personal protective equipment]] is required.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Washington, D.C. [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 "Occupational noise exposure."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|29|1910|95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, [[Buy Quiet]] programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5744">'''Nominal terms''' are a [[metalanguage]] for embedding object languages with binding constructs into.  Intuitively, they may be seen as an extension of first-order terms with support for name binding.  Consequently, the native notion of equality between two nominal terms is [[Lambda calculus|alpha-equivalence]] (equivalence up to a permutative renaming of bound names).  Nominal terms came out of a programme of research into [[Nominal techniques|nominal sets]], and have a concrete semantics in those sets.

Nominal unification is efficiently decidable.  This fact led to the development of [[alphaProlog]], a [[Prolog]]-like [[logic programming]] language with facilities for binding names in terms, where Prolog's standard [[Unification (computing)|first-order unification algorithm]] is replaced with nominal unification.

Nominal term embeddings may be seen as alternatives to [[de Bruijn index|de Bruijn encodings]] and [[higher-order abstract syntax]], where the latter uses the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] as a metalanguage.

==Motivation==

Many interesting calculi, [[logics]] and [[programming languages]] that are commonly seen in computer science feature name binding constructs.  For instance, the universal quantifier from [[first-order logic]], the lambda-binder from the [[lambda-calculus]], and the pi-binder from the [[pi-calculus]] are all examples of name-binding constructs.

[[Computer scientists]] often need to manipulate [[abstract syntax trees]].  For instance, [[compiler]] writers perform many manipulations of abstract syntax trees during the various optimisation and elaboration phases of compiler execution.  In particular, when working with abstract syntax trees with name binding constructs, we often want to work on alpha-equivalence classes, implement capture-avoiding substitutions, and make it easy to generate fresh names.  How best to do this, in a bug free and reliable manner, motivates a large amount of research.

Prior attempts at solving this problem include 'nameless approaches' such as de Bruijn indices and levels, and higher-order approaches such as higher-order abstract syntax.  Nominal terms are another, relatively new, approach that retain explicit names for bound variables like higher-order abstract syntax, whilst retaining the first-order flavour (and first-order computational properties) of de Bruijn encodings.

==Relation with higher-order patterns==

Higher-order unification is known to be [[undecidable problem|undecidable]].  This motivates the search for subsets of lambda-terms that enjoy a computationally well-behaved unification procedure.  Higher-order patterns, proposed by Miller, are one such set.

Higher-order patterns are [[Lambda calculus|lambda-terms]] where the arguments of a free variable are all distinct bound variables.  They possess an efficiently decidable unification procedure, and as a result, have been widely implemented, notably in the logic programming language [[lambdaProlog]].

A recent body of work has investigated the connections between nominal terms and higher-order patterns, and consequently between nominal unification and higher-order pattern unification.  Cheney proposed an extension of nominal terms called nominal patterns.  He then provided a translation between nominal patterns and higher-order patterns which preserved [[Unification (computer science)|unifiers]].  Later, Levy and Villaret demonstrated a translation between nominal terms and higher-order patterns that preserves the notion of unifiability.  That is, if two nominal terms are unifiable, then their translated pattern counterparts are also unifiable.

Dowek and Gabbay later sharpened Levy and Villaret's translation, proving that in some sense their translation is the best that there can be, and proved that the improved translation preserves unifiers.  That is, if two nominal terms are unifiable by some substitution, then the corresponding higher-order pattern unification problem under the translation is solved by the translated substitution.  For their proof, Dowek and Gabbay used a variation of nominal terms called permissive nominal terms.  However, a translation from permissive nominal terms and back again also exists, completing the translation between nominal terms and higher-order patterns.

'''Nuclear physics''' is the field of [[physics]] that studies [[atomic nuclei]] and their constituents and interactions. Other forms of [[nuclear matter]] are also studied.&lt;ref name=nupecc_report&gt;{{cite report

Nuclear physics should not be confused with [[atomic physics]], which studies the [[atom]] as a whole, including its [[electron]]s.

Discoveries in nuclear physics have led to [[nuclear technology|applications]] in many fields. This includes [[nuclear power]], [[nuclear weapons]], [[nuclear medicine]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]], industrial and agricultural isotopes, [[ion implantation]] in [[materials engineering]], and [[radiocarbon dating]] in [[geology]] and [[archaeology]]. Such applications are studied in the field of [[nuclear engineering]].

[[Particle physics]] evolved out of nuclear physics and the two fields are typically taught in close association. [[Nuclear astrophysics]], the application of nuclear physics to [[astrophysics]], is crucial in explaining the inner workings of [[stars]] and the [[nucleosynthesis|origin of the chemical elements]].

The history of nuclear physics as a discipline distinct from [[atomic physics]] starts with the discovery of [[radioactivity]] by [[Henri Becquerel]] in 1896,&lt;ref name=brm&gt;{{cite book

At the beginning of the 20th century the accepted model of the atom was J. J. Thomson's [[Plum pudding model|"plum pudding" model]] in which the atom was a positively charged ball with smaller negatively charged electrons embedded inside it.

In the years that followed, radioactivity was extensively investigated, notably by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] as well as by [[Ernest Rutherford]] and his collaborators. By the turn of the century physicists had also discovered three types of [[radiation]] emanating from atoms, which they named [[alpha decay|alpha]], [[beta decay|beta]], and [[gamma decay|gamma]] radiation. Experiments by [[Otto Hahn]] in 1911 and by [[James Chadwick]] in 1914 discovered that the beta decay [[spectrum]] was continuous rather than discrete. That is, electrons were ejected from the atom with a continuous range of energies, rather than the discrete amounts of energy that were observed in gamma and alpha decays. This was a problem for nuclear physics at the time, because it seemed to indicate that [[conservation of energy|energy was not conserved]] in these decays.

The 1903 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics was awarded jointly to Becquerel for his discovery and to Marie and Pierre Curie for their subsequent research into radioactivity. Rutherford was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 for his "investigations into the disintegration of the elements and the chemistry of radioactive substances".

In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] formulated the idea of [[mass–energy equivalence]]. While the work on radioactivity by Becquerel and Marie Curie predates this, an explanation of the source of the energy of radioactivity would have to wait for the discovery that the nucleus itself was composed of smaller constituents, the [[nucleon]]s.

=== Rutherford's team discovers the nucleus ===
In 1906 [[Ernest Rutherford]] published "Retardation of the α Particle from Radium in passing through matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rutherford|first=Ernest|author-link1=Ernest Rutherford|title=On the retardation of the α particle from radium in passing through matter|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]|year=1906|volume=12|number=68|pages=134–146|doi=10.1080/14786440609463525}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Geiger]] expanded on this work in a communication to the [[Royal Society]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geiger|first=Hans|author-link1=Hans Geiger|title=On the scattering of α-particles by matter|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|year=1908|volume=81|number=546|pages=174–177|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/81/546/174|doi=10.1098/rspa.1908.0067 |bibcode=1908RSPSA..81..174G}}&lt;/ref&gt; with experiments he and Rutherford had done, passing alpha particles through air, aluminum foil and gold leaf. More work was published in 1909 by Geiger and [[Ernest Marsden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =Geiger | first1 =Hans| author-link1=Hans Geiger|last2=Marsden|first2=Ernest|author-link2=Ernest Marsden| title=On the diffuse reflection of the α-particles | year =1909 | volume=82| pages =495|number=557|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] | url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/82/557/495 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1909.0054 |bibcode=1909RSPSA..82..495G}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further greatly expanded work was published in 1910 by Geiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geiger|first=Hans|author-link1=Hans Geiger|title=The scattering of the α-particles by matter|year=1910|volume=83|number=565|pages=492–504|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/83/565/492|doi=10.1098/rspa.1910.0038|bibcode=1910RSPSA..83..492G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911–1912 Rutherford went before the Royal Society to explain the experiments and propound the new theory of the atomic nucleus as we now understand it.

The key experiment behind this announcement was performed in 1910 at the [[University of Manchester]]: Ernest Rutherford's team performed a remarkable [[Geiger–Marsden experiment|experiment]] in which Geiger and Marsden under Rutherford's supervision fired alpha particles ([[helium]] nuclei) at a thin film of [[gold]] foil. The [[plum pudding model]] had predicted that the alpha particles should come out of the foil with their trajectories being at most slightly bent. But Rutherford instructed his team to look for something that shocked him to observe: a few particles were scattered through large angles, even completely backwards in some cases. He likened it to firing a bullet at tissue paper and having it bounce off. The discovery, with Rutherford's analysis of the data in 1911, led to the Rutherford model of the atom, in which the atom had a very small, very dense nucleus containing most of its mass, and consisting of heavy positively charged particles with embedded electrons in order to balance out the charge (since the neutron was unknown). As an example, in this model (which is not the modern one) nitrogen-14 consisted of a nucleus with 14 protons and 7 electrons (21 total particles) and the nucleus was surrounded by 7 more orbiting electrons.

Around 1920, [[Arthur Eddington]] anticipated the discovery and mechanism of [[nuclear fusion]] processes in [[star]]s, in his paper ''The Internal Constitution of the Stars''.&lt;ref name=eddington&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eddington |first=A. S. |title=The Internal Constitution of the Stars |journal=The Scientific Monthly |volume=11 |issue=4 |year=1920 |pages=297–303 |jstor=6491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eddington2&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1916MNRAS..77...16E|title=On the radiative equilibrium of the stars|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=77|pages=16–35|author1=Eddington|first1=A. S.|year=1916|doi=10.1093/mnras/77.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington correctly speculated that the source was [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of hydrogen into helium, liberating enormous energy according to Einstein's equation ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. This was a particularly remarkable development since at that time fusion and thermonuclear energy, and even that stars are largely composed of [[hydrogen]] (see [[metallicity]]), had not yet been discovered.

The Rutherford model worked quite well until studies of [[spin (physics)|nuclear spin]] were carried out by [[Franco Rasetti]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1929. By 1925 it was known that protons and electrons each had a spin of {{frac|+/-1|2}}. In the Rutherford model of nitrogen-14, 20 of the total 21 nuclear particles should have paired up to cancel each other's spin, and the final odd particle should have left the nucleus with a net spin of {{frac|1|2}}. Rasetti discovered, however, that nitrogen-14 had a spin of 1.

=== James Chadwick discovers the neutron ===
{{Main|Discovery of the neutron}}
In 1932 Chadwick realized that radiation that had been observed by [[Walther Bothe]], [[Herbert Becker (physicist)|Herbert Becker]], [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irène]] and [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] was actually due to a neutral particle of about the same mass as the proton, that he called the [[neutron]] (following a suggestion from Rutherford about the need for such a particle).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chadwick|first=James|author-link1=James Chadwick|title=The existence of a neutron|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|year=1932|volume=136|number=830|pages=692–708| url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/136/830/692|doi=10.1098/rspa.1932.0112 |bibcode=1932RSPSA.136..692C}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year [[Dmitri Ivanenko]] suggested that there were no electrons in the nucleus — only protons and neutrons — and that neutrons were spin {{frac|1|2}} particles which explained the mass not due to protons. The neutron spin immediately solved the problem of the spin of nitrogen-14, as the one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron in this model each contributed a spin of {{frac|1|2}} in the same direction, giving a final total spin of 1.

With the discovery of the neutron, scientists could at last calculate what fraction of [[binding energy]] each nucleus had, by comparing the nuclear mass with that of the protons and neutrons which composed it. Differences between nuclear masses were calculated in this way. When nuclear reactions were measured, these were found to agree with Einstein's calculation of the equivalence of mass and energy to within 1% as of 1934.

=== Proca's equations of the massive vector boson field ===
[[Alexandru Proca]] was the first to develop and report the massive vector [[boson]] [[field equation]]s and a theory of the [[meson]]ic field of [[nuclear force]]s. Proca's equations were known to [[Wolfgang Pauli]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Pauli'', Nobel lecture'', December 13, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; who mentioned the equations in his Nobel address, and they were also known to Yukawa, Wentzel, Taketani, Sakata, Kemmer, Heitler, and Fröhlich who appreciated the content of Proca's equations for developing a theory of the atomic nuclei in Nuclear Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1051/epn:2006504  |title=Alexandru Proca (1897–1955) and his equation of the massive vector boson field |first=Dorin N. |last=Poenaru |first2=Alexandru |last2=Calboreanu |journal=[[Europhysics News]]|via=http://www.europhysicsnews.org  |volume=37|issue=5|pages=25–27 |bibcode = 2006ENews..37...24P |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''G.

===Yukawa's meson postulated to bind nuclei===
In 1935 [[Hideki Yukawa]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11429/ppmsj1919.17.0_48}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the first significant theory of the [[strong force]] to explain how the nucleus holds together. In the [[Yukawa interaction]] a [[virtual particle]], later called a [[meson]], mediated a force between all nucleons, including protons and neutrons. This force explained why nuclei did not disintegrate under the influence of proton repulsion, and it also gave an explanation of why the attractive [[strong force]] had a more limited range than the electromagnetic repulsion between protons. Later, the discovery of the [[pi meson]] showed it to have the properties of Yukawa's particle.

With Yukawa's papers, the modern model of the atom was complete. The center of the atom contains a tight ball of neutrons and protons, which is held together by the strong nuclear force, unless it is too large. Unstable nuclei may undergo alpha decay, in which they emit an energetic helium nucleus, or beta decay, in which they eject an electron (or [[positron]]). After one of these decays the resultant nucleus may be left in an excited state, and in this case it decays to its ground state by emitting high energy photons (gamma decay).

The study of the strong and weak nuclear forces (the latter explained by [[Enrico Fermi]] via [[Fermi's interaction]] in 1934) led physicists to collide nuclei and electrons at ever higher energies. This research became the science of [[particle physics]], the crown jewel of which is the [[Standard Model|standard model of particle physics]] which describes the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces.

==Modern nuclear physics==
{{Main|Liquid-drop model|Nuclear shell model|Nuclear structure}}
A heavy nucleus can contain hundreds of [[nucleon]]s. This means that with some approximation it can be treated as a [[Newtonian mechanics|classical system]], rather than a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] one. In the resulting [[liquid-drop model]],&lt;ref&gt;J.M.Blatt and V.F.Weisskopf, Theoretical Nuclear Physics, Springer, 1979, VII.5&lt;/ref&gt; the nucleus has an energy which arises partly from [[surface tension]] and partly from electrical repulsion of the protons. The liquid-drop model is able to reproduce many features of nuclei, including the general trend of [[binding energy]] with respect to mass number, as well as the phenomenon of [[nuclear fission]].

Superimposed on this classical picture, however, are quantum-mechanical effects, which can be described using the [[nuclear shell model]], developed in large part by [[Maria Goeppert Mayer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.75.1969|title = On Closed Shells in Nuclei. II|journal = Physical Review|volume = 75|issue = 12|pages = 1969–1970|year = 1949|last1 = Mayer|first1 = Maria Goeppert}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[J. Hans D. Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.75.1766.2|title = On the "Magic Numbers" in Nuclear Structure|journal = Physical Review|volume = 75|issue = 11|pages = 1766|year = 1949|last1 = Haxel|first1 = Otto|last2 = Jensen|first2 = J. Hans D|last3 = Suess|first3 = Hans E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclei with certain numbers of neutrons and protons (the [[Magic number (physics)|magic numbers]] 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126, ...) are particularly stable, because their [[Nuclear shell model|shells]] are filled.

Other more complicated models for the nucleus have also been proposed, such as the [[interacting boson model]], in which pairs of neutrons and protons interact as [[boson]]s, analogously to [[Cooper pair]]s of electrons.

[[ab initio methods (nuclear physics)|Ab initio methods]] try to solve the nuclear many-body problem from the ground up, starting from the nucleons and their interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephenson|first1=C.|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Topological properties of a self-assembled electrical network via ab initio calculation|journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7|issue=1|pages=932|date=2017|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-01007-9|pmid=28428625|pmc=5430567|bibcode=2017NatSR...7..932B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of current research in nuclear physics relates to the study of nuclei under extreme conditions such as high [[spin (physics)|spin]] and excitation energy. Nuclei may also have extreme shapes (similar to that of [[Rugby ball]]s or even [[pear]]s) or extreme neutron-to-proton ratios. Experimenters can create such nuclei using artificially induced fusion or nucleon transfer reactions, employing ion beams from an [[particle accelerator|accelerator]]. Beams with even higher energies can be used to create nuclei at very high temperatures, and there are signs that these experiments have produced a [[phase transition]] from normal nuclear matter to a new state, the [[quark–gluon plasma]], in which the [[quark]]s mingle with one another, rather than being segregated in triplets as they are in neutrons and protons.

===Nuclear decay===
{{Main|Radioactivity|Valley of stability}}
Eighty elements have at least one [[stable isotope]] which is never observed to decay, amounting to a total of about 254 stable isotopes. However, thousands of [[isotope]]s have been characterized as unstable. These "radioisotopes" decay over time scales ranging from fractions of a second to trillions of years.  Plotted on a chart as a function of atomic and neutron numbers, the binding energy of the nuclides forms what is known as the [[valley of stability]].  Stable nuclides lie along the bottom of this energy valley, while increasingly unstable nuclides lie up the valley walls, that is, have weaker binding energy.

The most stable nuclei fall within certain ranges or balances of composition of neutrons and protons: too few or too many neutrons (in relation to the number of protons) will cause it to decay. For example, in [[beta decay]] a [[nitrogen]]-16 atom (7 protons, 9 neutrons) is converted to an [[oxygen]]-16 atom (8 protons, 8 neutrons)&lt;ref&gt;Not a typical example as it results in a "doubly magic" nucleus&lt;/ref&gt; within a few seconds of being created. In this decay a neutron in the nitrogen nucleus is converted by the [[weak interaction]] into a proton, an electron and an [[antineutrino]]. The element is transmuted to another element, with a different number of protons.

In [[alpha decay]] (which typically occurs in the heaviest nuclei) the radioactive element decays by emitting a helium nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons), giving another element, plus helium-4. In many cases this process continues through several steps of this kind, including other types of decays (usually beta decay) until a stable element is formed.

In [[gamma decay]], a nucleus decays from an excited state into a lower energy state, by emitting a [[gamma ray]]. The element is not changed to another element in the process (no [[nuclear transmutation]] is involved).

Other more exotic decays are possible (see the first main article). For example, in [[internal conversion]] decay, the energy from an excited nucleus may eject one of the inner orbital electrons from the atom, in a process which produces high speed electrons, but is not [[beta decay]], and (unlike beta decay) does not transmute one element to another.

===Nuclear fusion===
In [[nuclear fusion]], two low mass nuclei come into very close contact with each other, so that the strong force fuses them. It requires a large amount of energy for the strong or [[nuclear force]]s to overcome the electrical repulsion between the nuclei in order to fuse them; therefore nuclear fusion can only take place at very high temperatures or high pressures. When nuclei fuse, a very large amount of energy is released and the combined nucleus assumes a lower energy level. The binding energy per nucleon increases with mass number up to [[nickel]]-62. [[Star]]s like the Sun are powered by the fusion of four protons into a helium nucleus, two [[positron]]s, and two [[neutrinos]]. The uncontrolled fusion of hydrogen into helium is known as thermonuclear runaway. A frontier in current research at various institutions, for example the [[Joint European Torus]] (JET) and [[ITER]], is the development of an economically viable method of using energy from a controlled fusion reaction.
Nuclear fusion is the origin of the energy (including in the form of light and other electromagnetic radiation) produced by the core of all stars including our own Sun.

===Nuclear fission===
[[Nuclear fission]] is the reverse process to fusion. For nuclei heavier than nickel-62 the binding energy per nucleon decreases with the mass number. It is therefore possible for energy to be released if a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two lighter ones.

The process of [[alpha decay]] is in essence a special type of spontaneous [[nuclear fission]]. It is a highly asymmetrical fission because the four particles which make up the alpha particle are especially tightly bound to each other, making production of this nucleus in fission particularly likely.

From certain of the heaviest nuclei whose fission produces free neutrons, and which also easily absorb neutrons to initiate fission, a self-igniting type of neutron-initiated fission can be obtained, in a [[chain reaction]]. Chain reactions were known in chemistry before physics, and in fact many familiar processes like fires and chemical explosions are chemical chain reactions. The fission or [[Nuclear chain reaction|"nuclear" chain-reaction]], using fission-produced neutrons, is the source of energy for [[nuclear power]] plants and fission type nuclear bombs, such as those detonated in [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], Japan, at the end of [[World War II]]. Heavy nuclei such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] may also undergo [[spontaneous fission]], but they are much more likely to undergo decay by alpha decay.

For a neutron-initiated chain reaction to occur, there must be a [[critical mass]] of the relevant isotope present in a certain space under certain conditions. The conditions for the smallest critical mass require the conservation of the emitted neutrons and also their slowing or [[neutron moderator|moderation]] so that there is a greater [[Neutron cross section|cross-section]] or probability of them initiating another fission. In two regions of [[Oklo]], Gabon, Africa, [[natural nuclear fission reactor]]s were active over 1.5 billion years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Meshik |first=A. P. |authorlink= |date=November 2005 |title=The Workings of an Ancient Nuclear Reactor |journal=Scientific American |volume= 293|issue= 5|pages= 82–91|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=ancient-nuclear-reactor |accessdate=2014-01-04 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1105-82|bibcode=2005SciAm.293e..82M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of natural neutrino emission have demonstrated that around half of the heat emanating from the Earth's core results from radioactive decay. However, it is not known if any of this results from fission chain reactions.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Production of "heavy" elements (atomic number greater than five) ===
{{main|nucleosynthesis}}
According to the theory, as the Universe cooled after the [[Big Bang]] it eventually became possible for common subatomic particles as we know them (neutrons, protons and electrons) to exist. The most common particles created in the Big Bang which are still easily observable to us today were protons and electrons (in equal numbers). The protons would eventually form hydrogen atoms. Almost all the neutrons created in the Big Bang were absorbed into [[helium-4]] in the first three minutes after the Big Bang, and this helium accounts for most of the helium in the universe today (see [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]).

Some relatively small quantities of elements beyond helium (lithium, beryllium, and perhaps some boron) were created in the Big Bang, as the protons and neutrons collided with each other, but all of the "heavier elements" (carbon, element number 6, and elements of greater [[atomic number]]) that we see today, were created inside stars during a series of fusion stages, such as the [[proton-proton chain]], the [[CNO cycle]] and the [[triple-alpha process]]. Progressively heavier elements are created during the [[stellar evolution|evolution]] of a star.

Since the binding energy per [[nucleon]] peaks around iron (56 nucleons), energy is only released in fusion processes involving smaller atoms than that. Since the creation of heavier nuclei by fusion requires energy, nature resorts to the process of neutron capture. Neutrons (due to their lack of charge) are readily absorbed by a nucleus. The heavy elements are created by either a ''slow'' neutron capture process (the so-called ''s'' process) or the ''rapid'', or ''r'' process. The ''s'' process occurs in thermally pulsing stars (called AGB, or asymptotic giant branch stars) and takes hundreds to thousands of years to reach the heaviest elements of lead and bismuth. The ''r'' process is thought to occur in [[supernova explosions]] which provide the necessary conditions of high temperature, high neutron flux and ejected matter. These stellar conditions make the successive neutron captures very fast, involving very neutron-rich species which then beta-decay to heavier elements, especially at the so-called waiting points that correspond to more stable nuclides with closed neutron shells (magic numbers).

[[File:Joaquim Vayreda - The Beginning of Spring - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|300px|The Beginning of Spring, by Joaquim Vayreda]]
The '''Olot school''' of landscape painting is a group of painters that created an artistic style in the second half of the 19th century. It includes not simply artists from [[Olot]] (in [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]]), but all artists whose artworks were inspired by the countryside of Olot.  By extension, artists connected with Olot and its [[Comarcas of Spain|comarca]], [[Garrotxa]].

== History ==
In Catalonia, the proliferation of painting coincided with the [[Spain under the Restoration|Restoration]], a period marked by economic prosperity that favored the [[bourgeoisie]] which was the motor of the cultural renaissance of [[Catalan nationalism]]. This bourgeoisie had considerable influence in the arts; it sought art that was realistic, but simultaneously pleasing, elegant, and optimistic, and preferred painting over other artistic disciplines. During this period, several schools of art began and were consolidated, among them the Olot school.

The Olot school of landscape painting is similar to the [[Barbizon school]]. It was formed by [[Joaquim Vayreda|Joaquim]] and [[Marian Vayreda i Vila|Marian Vayreda]] with the assistance of [[Ramón Martí Alsina]]. From this tradition emerged a new artistic concept: creating multiple versions of the Olot countryside, where the treatment of light and chromatic variations were important elements. The Olot school used the countryside of Garrotxa as a source of inspiration for their work, but with stylistic freedom. Vayreda's paintings attracted the attention of artists including [[Laureano Barrau|Laureà Barrau]], [[Enric Galwey]], [[Joan Brull]], [[Lluís Masriera i Rosés|Lluís Masriera]], [[Modest Urgell]], [[Ramon Casas]], and [[Santiago Rusiñol]], who went to Olot and also painted depictions of the countryside.
[[File:BergaiBoix s-t(cel rogent) 1908.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Red Sky, by Josep Berga i Boix]]
The Olot school was supported by the founding of the Olot Art School (Escola d'Art d'Olot) in 1783 by bishop [[Tomás de Lorenzana]], and also by the creation of workshops dedicated to the reproduction of religious images. The first workshop that was dedicated to this work, "El Arte Cristiano", was founded in 1880. The industry of religious image making expanded considerably starting around 1900 in Olot, and became an important part of the city's economy. Today, the old Arte Cristiano factory has been converted into the Museum of the Saints (Museo de los Santos).

The Olot school was institutionalized by painter [[Josep Berga i Boix]], who served as director of the Olot Artistic and Cultural Center (Centre Artístic-Cultural d'Olot) (founded by Vayreda) in 1869 and later as director of the Public School of Drawing (Escola Pública de Dibuix) from 1877-1914. Annual exhibitions were organized first by the Artistic and Cultural Center and then by other entities.

Numerous other artists later continued the traditions of the Olot school, often training at the Public School of Drawing (called the Escola de Belles Arts i Oficis starting in 1939) under the direction of [[Ivó Pascual]], [[Martí Casadevall]], [[Bartomeu Mas y Collellmir]], and [[Joan Vilà i Moncau]]. Other artists belonging to the movement include [[Josep Berga i Boada]], [[Josep Clarà]], [[Melcior Domenge]], and [[Josep Pinós]].

== The Olot school today ==
The Drawing Festival (Fira del Dibuix) is celebrated annually in Olot on the Day of Sant Lluc. This festival brings together many artists that sell their works directly to the public. The festival was conceived particularly for the sale of works on paper, such as sketches, but recently it has been possible to find artworks in many media.

Since the 2003-2004 academic year, the Olot Art School (Escola d'Art d'Olot) has been called the [[Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot|Superior School of Art and Design]] (Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny), adding a degree in interior design; a graphic design degree was added in 2007-2008. Today, there are more than 400 students enrolled, particularly from the neighboring comarcas.

Today, the term "Olot school"--or particularly the term "Olot school of landscape painting" ("escuela paisajística de Olot" or "escola paisatgística d'Olot")--is not well-accepted, because not all artists connected with Olot paint landscapes, and not all the artists connected with the school work or live in the city of Olot.

[[File:Eucalyptus erythrocorys operculum.jpg|thumb|right|The flower buds of ''[[Eucalyptus erythrocorys]]'' have a large, bright red operculum.]]
An '''operculum''' or (in plural) '''opercula''' are [[botany|botanical]] terms describing a certain structure or structures of certain [[vascular plant]]s, [[moss]]es, or [[fungus|fungi]] which act as a cap, flap, or lid. In vascular plants, an operculum may also be called a '''bud cap'''.

Examples of structures identified as opercula include:
*A flap of the [[sporangium]] of a [[moss]], covering the [[peristome]] (appendages surrounding the mouth of a moss capsule).
*The cap of the [[ascus]] in certain [[Ascomycota|ascomycetous]] fungi.
*A lid covering the aperture of [[pollen]] grains.
*The bud cap covering the flowers of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' and ''[[Corymbia]]'' trees which falls off as they open.
*The covering of a pyxidium (fruit [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] whose upper part falls off when the seeds are released) of a plant, such as the [[Plantago|plantain]].
*The flared [[leaflet (botany)|leaflet]] that prevents a [[pitcher plant]] from accumulating rainwater.

'''Population density''' (in [[agriculture]]: [[Stock (disambiguation)|standing stock]] and [[standing crop]]) is a measurement of [[population]] per unit area or unit volume; it is a quantity of type [[number density]]. It is frequently applied to [[living organisms]], and most of the time to [[human]]s. It is a key geographical term.&lt;ref name=about&gt;Matt Rosenberg [http://geography.about.com/od/populationgeography/a/popdensity.htm Population Density]. Geography.about.com. March 2, 2011. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In simple terms population density refers to the number of people living in an area per kilometer square.

== Biological population densities ==
Population density is population divided by total land area or water volume, as appropriate.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

Low densities may cause an [[extinction vortex]] and lead to further reduced fertility. This is called the [[Allee effect]] after the scientist who identified it. Examples of the causes in low population densities include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Minimum_viable_population_size Minimum viable population size]. Eoearth.org (March 6, 2010).

{{main|List of countries and territories by population density}}
For [[human]]s, population density is the number of people per unit of area, usually quoted per square kilometer or square mile (which may include or exclude, for example, areas of water or glaciers). Commonly this may be calculated for a [[county]], [[list of cities by population density|city]], [[country]], another [[territory (country subdivision)|territory]] or the [[Earth|entire world]].

The [[world's population]] is around 7,500,000,000&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/main/www/popclock.html U.S. &amp; World Population Clocks]. Census.gov. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Earth]]'s total area (including land and water) is 510,000,000 square kilometers (197,000,000 sq. mi.).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/xx.html World]. CIA World Handbook&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the worldwide human population density is around 7,500,000,000 ÷ 510,000,000 = 14.7 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (38 per sq. mi). If only the Earth's land area of 150,000,000  km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (58,000,000 sq. mi.) is taken into account, then human population density is 50 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (129 per sq. mile). This includes all continental and island land area, including [[Antarctica]]. If Antarctica is also excluded, then population density rises to over 55 people per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (over 142 per sq. mile).&lt;ref name=about/&gt; However, over half{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} of the Earth's land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human habitation, such as deserts and high mountains, and population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh-water sources. Thus, this number by itself does not give any helpful measurement of human population density.

Several of the most densely populated territories in the world are [[city-state]]s, [[microstate]]s and [[Dependent territory|dependencies]].&lt;ref name=unpop&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2008/wpp2008_text_tables.pdf | title=World Population Prospects, Table A.1| version=2008 revision | format=PDF | publisher=United Nations | author=Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division | year=2009 | accessdate= March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Monaco government uses a smaller surface area figure resulting in a population density of 18,078 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These territories have a relatively small area and a high [[urbanization]] level, with an economically specialized [[city]] population drawing also on rural resources outside the area, illustrating the difference between high population density and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]

The potential to maintain the agricultural aspects of deserts is extremely limited as there is not enough precipitation to support a sustainable land. The population in these areas are extremely low. Therefore cities in the Middle East, such as Dubai, have been increasing in population and infrastructure growth at a fast pace. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/41320143|title=Desert regions : population, migration, and environment|last=1923-2009.|first=Portnov, B. A. (Boris Adolʹfovich) Hare, A. Paul (Alexander Paul),|date=1999|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=3540657800|location=|pages=|oclc=41320143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities with high population densities are, by some, considered to be overpopulated, though this will depend on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure and access to resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalissues.org/issue/198/human-population Human Population]. Global Issues. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the most densely populated cities are in [[Southeast Asia]], though [[Cairo]] and [[Lagos]] in [[Africa]] also fall into this category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/largest-cities-density-125.html The largest cities in the world by land area, population and density]. Citymayors.com. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

City population and especially area are, however, heavily dependent on the definition of "urban area" used: densities are almost invariably higher for the central city area than when suburban settlements and the intervening rural areas are included, as in the areas of [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] or [[metropolitan area]], the latter sometimes including neighboring cities. For instance, [[Milwaukee]] has a greater population density when just the inner city is measured, and the surrounding suburbs excluded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisconline.com/greenmap/milwaukee/population.html The Population of Milwaukee County]. Wisconline.com. Retrieved on December 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, based on a world population of seven billion, the world's inhabitants, as a loose crowd taking up ten square feet (one square metre) per person ([[Jacobs Method]]), would occupy a space a little larger than [[Delaware]]'s land area.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Other methods of measurement ===

Although arithmetic density is the most common way of measuring population density, several other methods have been developed to provide a more accurate measure of population density over a specific area.
* '''Arithmetic density''': The total number of people / area of land (measured in square miles or square kilometers)
* '''[[Physiological density]]''': The total population / area of [[arable land]]
* '''Agricultural density''': The total ''rural'' population / area of [[arable land]]
* '''Residential density''': The number of people living in an urban area / area of residential land
* '''[[Urban density]]''': The number of people inhabiting an urban area / total area of urban land
* '''Ecological optimum''': The density of population that can be supported by the natural resources

The '''RealDoll''' is a life-size [[sex doll]] (also considered a [[mannequin]]) manufactured by Abyss Creations, LLC in [[San Marcos, California]], and sold worldwide.  It has a poseable [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] skeleton with steel joints and [[silicone]] flesh.

==Details and history==
The RealDolls are designed to recreate the appearance, texture, and weight of the human female and male form. Their primary function is to serve as [[sex partner]]s. This activity can be accompanied by certain preparations such as dressing them up in different types of clothing, changing wigs or makeup, and even adjusting body temperature by use of electric blankets or baths.

Early prototypes were made from solid [[latex]] with an [[Endoskeleton|interior]] [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], but construction of the outer material was later switched to [[silicone]]. In June 2009, Abyss Creations switched from tin cure silicone to platinum silicone, which resulted in dolls that are less prone to tears and compression marks than older RealDolls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doll Street Journal |url=http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewnewsletter&amp;volume=200907 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804200602/http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewnewsletter&amp;volume=200907 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-08-04 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  

The current incarnation of the female RealDoll product was introduced in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official RealDoll website|url=http://www.realdoll.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Abyss introduced the "Face-X" system, allowing any face to be interchangeable with any body. Multiple faces can then be attached one at a time to a single doll by the owner.  As of 2011, there are nine female bodies and 16 female faces in the first product line. In 2009 the RealDoll&amp;nbsp;2 was introduced, which feature removable inserts for the [[Mouth#In humans|mouth]] and [[vagina]] and faces that attach by magnets instead of Velcro.  The line started with two female bodies and three female faces and as of 2013 offers ten faces and three bodies. Another female body is in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doll Forum Announcement|url=http://dollforum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=89&amp;t=37588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Charlie", the first male RealDoll, was retired in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abyss News Page |url=http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewpage&amp;section=viewnewsarticle&amp;newsnumberentry=2008051602 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331041052/http://www.realdoll.com/cgi-bin/snav.rd?action=viewpage&amp;section=viewnewsarticle&amp;newsnumberentry=2008051602 |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced with two body types and three head types. "[[Transgender]]" dolls may also be purchased from the company, although these must be custom ordered. Abyss also sells silicone toys such as female torso products and dildos among other offerings.

For a time, the company also offered customizations such as robotic hip actuators, finger skeletons (instead of the usual finger wires) and computer-controlled speech feedback, but these expensive options are no longer available.

'''Samuel Sinyangwe''' (born c. 1990) is an American [[Policy analysis|policy analyst]] and [[Racial equality|racial justice]] [[Activism|activist]]. Sinyangwe is a member of the [[Movement for Black Lives]] and a co-founder of We the Protestors, a group of digital tools that include Mapping Police Violence, a database of police killings in the [[United States]], and [[Campaign Zero]], a policy platform to end police violence. Sinyangwe is a co-host the [[Pod Save the People|''Pod Save the People'']] podcast, where he discusses the week's news with a panel of other activists.

== Early life ==
Sinyangwe was born circa 1990.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He grew up in [[College Park (Orlando)|College Park]] neighborhood of [[Orlando, Florida]] and attended [[Winter Park High School]] in the [[International Baccalaureate|International Baccalaureat]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;e program.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cordeiro|first1=Monivette|title=How an Orlando data scientist is helping #BlackLivesMatter make the case against police violence|url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/how-an-orlando-data-scientist-is-helping-the-blacklivesmatter-movement-make-the-case-against-police-violence/Content?oid=2478826|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=Orlando Weekly|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has discussed the influence of his upbringing in Florida, where he was a black child often surrounded by white peers, on his eventual career trajectory; he was shaken and moved to action after the 2013 [[Trial of George Zimmerman|acquittal of George Zimmerman]] in the shooting death of [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin]] in [[Sanford, Florida]], where Sinyangwe had regularly attended soccer practice: "I was that kid. I could have been Trayvon. That’s why it hit me so personally and that’s why I realized that needed to be something that took the priority in terms of my focus."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Sinyangwe graduated from [[Stanford University]], where he studied how race intersects with American politics, economics, and class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marusic|first1=Kristina|title=This Map Of Police Violence Aims To Create A Path To Justice|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2133351/map-police-violence/|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=MTV News|date=April 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Sinyangwe started his career at PolicyLink with the Promise Neighborhoods Institute.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dHxqDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT476&amp;ots=ftZuIq_nxZ&amp;dq=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PT486#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Handbook of Developments in Digital Journalism Studies|last=Richardson|first=Allissa V.|date=2018-09-05|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781351982085|editor-last=Eldrige II|editor-first=Scott|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=28.

With other activists, Sinyangwe founded We the Protestors, an organization aimed at developing a set of digital tools to support [[Black Lives Matter]] activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3064214/meet-the-startup-building-the-digital-civil-rights-movement|title=Meet The Startup Building The Digital Civil Rights Movement|last=Peters|first=Adele|date=2016-10-03|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; We the Protestors projects include a database of police killings, Mapping Police Violence,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hellman|first1=Jaime|title=No clear picture on how many people are killed by police|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/Ali-Velshi-On-Target/articles/2015/5/28/No-data-on-how-many-killed-by-police-in-America.html|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=Al Jazeera America|date=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a platform of policy solutions to end police violence called [[Campaign Zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/the-latest-numbers-on-police-killings-show-the-problem-1793853657|title=The latest numbers on police killings show the problem may be worse than we thought|last=Meyerson|first=Collier|work=Splinter|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thefader.com/2017/05/20/activist-samuel-sinyangwe-louisiana-mass-incarceration|title=Activist Samuel Sinyangwe Sheds Light On Louisiana’s Horrible Mass Incarceration Problem|last=Lawler|first=Opheli Garcia|date=May 20, 2017|work=The Fader|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinyangwe also serves as a data scientist for OurStates.org, a project focused on state legislatures&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.abqjournal.com/981351/black-lives-matter-activists-turn-attention-to-statehouses.html|title=Black Lives Matter activists turn attention to statehouses|last=Whack|first=Errin Haines|date=April 3, 2017|website=Albuquerque Journal|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with Mckesson and [[Brittany Packnett|Brittney Packnett]] founded the [[Resistance Manual]], an open-source project aimed at connecting anti-racist activists with activists focused on intersecting issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediaite.com/online/deray-launches-resistance-manual-an-open-source-site-designed-to-take-on-trump/|title=DeRay and Stay Woke Activists Launch Resistance Manual, an Open-Source Site Designed To Take on Trump|last=Ellefson|first=Lindsey|date=January 17, 2017|website=Mediaite|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 U.S. Presidential campaign]], Sinyangwe and colleagues met with Democratic candidates [[Bernie Sanders]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liebelson|first1=Dana|last2=Reilly|first2=Ryan J.|title=Black Lives Matter Activists Meet With Bernie Sanders To Make Sure He's On Board|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-black-lives-matter_us_55f9ca9ce4b00310edf57b02|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hillary Clinton]] on these policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Liebelson|first1=Dana|last2=Reilly|first2=Ryan J.|title=Inside Hillary Clinton's Meeting With Black Lives Matter|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-lives-matter-hillary-clinton_us_56180c44e4b0e66ad4c7d9fa|accessdate=11 September 2016|work=The Huffington Post|date=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been a vocal critic of the "[[Ferguson effect|Ferguson Effect]]", using data to refute the theory that policing had diminished and crime increased in face of activist scrutiny of police use of force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nxqDwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;ots=9KiW8OUcM_&amp;dq=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22%20%22ferguson%20effect%22&amp;pg=PA120#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Samuel%20Sinyangwe%22%20%22ferguson%20effect%22&amp;f=false|title=Black Lives Matter: From a Moment to a Movement|last=Hillstrom|first=Laurie Collier|date=2018-09-07|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=|isbn=9781440865718|location=|pages=120-121|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melissa Harris-Perry]] has compared Sinyangwe to journalist and anti-[[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] activist [[Ida B. Wells]], noting that Wells began her work by "compil[ing] the data, the social science and research about how, when and where lynchings were happening to begin to make it stop."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10953">Within the fields of [[molecular biology]] and [[pharmacology]], a '''small molecule''' is a low molecular weight (&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;900 [[Atomic mass unit|daltons]]&lt;ref name = "Dougherty_Pucci_2012"&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Dougherty TJ, Pucci MJ | title =  Antibiotic Discovery and Development | year = 2012 | publisher = | location = | isbn = 978-1-4614-1400-1 | author = Macielag MJ | chapter = Chemical properties of antibacterials and their uniqueness | pages = 801–2 | quote = The majority of [oral] drugs from the general reference set have molecular weights below 550.

Most [[pharmaceuticals|drugs]] are small molecules. Larger structures such as [[nucleic acid]]s and [[protein]]s, and many [[polysaccharides]] are not small molecules, although their constituent monomers (ribo- or deoxyribonucleotides, [[amino acid]]s, and monosaccharides, respectively) are often considered small molecules. Small molecules may be used as research tools to probe [[function (biology)|biological function]] as well as [[lead compound|leads]] in the development of new [[pharmaceutical drug|therapeutic agents]]. Some can inhibit a specific function of a protein or disrupt [[protein–protein interaction]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid15060526"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arkin MR, Wells JA | title = Small-molecule inhibitors of protein-protein interactions: progressing towards the dream | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 301–17 |date=April 2004 | pmid = 15060526 | doi = 10.1038/nrd1343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pharmacology]] usually restricts the term "small molecule" to molecules that bind specific biological [[macromolecules]] and acts as an [[effector (biology)|effector]], altering the activity or function of the target. Small molecules can have a variety of biological functions or applications, serving as [[cell signaling]] molecules, [[drug]]s in [[medicine]], [[pesticide]]s in farming, and in many other roles. These compounds can be natural (such as [[secondary metabolites]]) or artificial (such as [[antiviral drug]]s); they may have a beneficial effect against a disease (such as [[pharmaceuticals|drugs]]) or may be detrimental (such as [[teratogen]]s and [[carcinogen]]s).

== Molecular weight cutoff ==

The upper [[Molecular mass|molecular-weight]] limit for a small molecule is approximately 900 daltons, which allows for the possibility to rapidly diffuse across cell membranes so that it can reach [[intracellular]] sites of action.&lt;ref name = "Dougherty_Pucci_2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12036371"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Veber DF, Johnson SR, Cheng HY, Smith BR, Ward KW, Kopple KD | title = Molecular properties that influence the oral bioavailability of drug candidates | journal = J. Med. Chem. | volume = 45 | issue = 12 | pages = 2615–23 |date=June 2002 | pmid = 12036371 | doi = 10.1021/jm020017n }}&lt;/ref&gt; This molecular weight cutoff is also a necessary but insufficient condition for oral [[bioavailability]] as it allows for [[transcellular transport]] through intestinal [[epithelial]] cells.  In addition to intestinal permeability, the molecule must also possess a reasonably rapid [[Dissolution (chemistry)#Rate of dissolution|rate of dissolution]] into water and adequate water [[solubility]] and moderate to low [[first pass metabolism]]. A somewhat lower molecular weight cutoff of 500 daltons (as part of the "[[rule of five]]") has been recommended for oral small molecule drug candidates based on the observation that clinical attrition rates are significantly reduced if the molecular weight is kept below this limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lipinski CA | title = Lead-and drug-like compounds: the rule-of-five revolution | journal = Drug Discovery Today: Technologies |date=December 2004 | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 337–341 | doi = 10.1016/j.ddtec.2004.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17971784"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leeson PD, Springthorpe B | title = The influence of drug-like concepts on decision-making in medicinal chemistry | journal = Nature Reviews Drug Discovery | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 881–90 |date=November 2007 | pmid = 17971784 | doi = 10.1038/nrd2445 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drugs==
{{further|Pharmaceutical drug}}

Most pharmaceuticals are small molecules, although some drugs can be proteins (e.g., [[insulin]] and other [[biologic medical product]]s). With the exception of [[Monoclonal antibody therapy|therapeutic antibodies]], many proteins are degraded if administered orally and most often cannot cross [[cell membrane]]s. Small molecules are more likely to be absorbed, although some of them are only absorbed after oral administration if given as [[prodrug]]s. One advantage small molecule drugs (SMDs) have over "large molecule" [[biologic medical product|biologics]] is that many small molecules can be taken orally whereas biologics generally require injection or another [[parenteral]] administration.&lt;ref name="Ganellin_2013"&gt;{{cite book | author = Samanen J |veditors=Ganellin CR, Jefferis R, Roberts SM | title = Introduction to Biological and Small Molecule Drug Research and Development: theory and case studies | edition = Kindle | publisher = Academic Press | location = New York | year = 2013 | pages = | quote = Table 5.13: Route of Administration: Small Molecules: oral administration usually possible; Biomolecules: Usually administered parenterally | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=342JY314Fl4C&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=small%20molecule%20vs%20biologics%20oral&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q=small%20molecule%20vs%20biologics%20oral&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-0-12-397176-0 | chapter = Chapter 5.2 How do SMDs differ from biomolecular drugs? | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-397176-0.00005-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Secondary metabolites ==

A variety of organisms including bacteria, fungi, and plants, produce small molecule [[secondary metabolite]]s also known as [[natural product]]s, which play a role in cell signaling, pigmentation and in defense against predation. Secondary metabolites are a rich source of biologically active compounds and hence are often used as research tools and leads for drug discovery.&lt;ref name="isbn978-0-444-53836-9"&gt;{{cite book | editor = Atta-ur-Rahman | title = Studies in Natural Products Chemistry | volume = 36 | language = | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam | year = 2012  | quote = | isbn = 978-0-444-53836-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of secondary metabolites include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8173">{{other uses|Spare Parts (disambiguation)}}
A '''spare part''', '''spare''', '''service part''', '''repair part''', or '''replacement part''', is an [[interchangeable part]] that is kept in an inventory and used for the repair or replacement of failed units. Spare parts are an important feature of [[logistics engineering]] and [[supply chain management]], often comprising dedicated [[spare parts management]] systems.

'''Capital spares''' are spare parts which, although acknowledged to have a long life or a small chance of [[failure]], would cause a long shutdown of equipment because it would take a long time to get a replacement for them. 

Spare parts are an outgrowth of the industrial development of interchangeable parts and [[mass production]].

==Classification==
[[File:Mitsubishi Type 73 Light Truck rear.jpg|thumb|right|A spare tire mounted at the rear of a Mitsubishi Type 73 Light Truck as an example of a repairable spare part.]]

In [[logistics]], spare parts can be broadly classified into two groups, [[repairable]]s and [[consumable]]s.

Economically, there is a tradeoff between the cost of [[procurement|ordering]] a replacement part and the cost of repairing a failed part.  When the cost of repair becomes a significant percentage of the cost of replacement, it becomes economically favorable to simply order a replacement part. In such cases, the part is said to be "beyond economic repair" (BER), and the percentage associated with this threshold is known as the BER rate. Analysis of economic tradeoffs is formally evaluated using [[Level of Repair Analysis]] (LORA).

===Repairable===
{{main|Repairable}}

Repairable parts are parts that are deemed worthy of repair, usually by virtue of economic consideration of their repair cost. Rather than bear the cost of completely replacing a finished product, repairables typically are designed to enable more affordable maintenance by being more modular. This allows components to be more easily removed, repaired, and replaced, enabling cheaper replacement. Spare parts that are needed to support condemnation of repairable parts are known as ''replenishment'' spares .

A rotable pool is a pool of repairable spare parts inventory set aside to allow for multiple repairs to be accomplished simultaneously. This can be used to minimize [[stockout]] conditions for repairable items.

===Consumable===
{{main|Consumables}}

Parts that are not repairable, are considered consumable parts. Consumable parts are usually [[scrap]]ped, or "condemned", when they are found to have failed. Since no attempt at repair is made, for a fixed [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF), replacement rates for consumption of consumables are higher than an equivalent item treated as a repairable part. Because of this, consumables tend to be lower cost items.

Because consumables are lower cost and higher volume, economies of scale can be found by ordering in large lot sizes, a so-called [[Economic order quantity]].

==Legislation==
There is no UK or [[EU]] [[legislation]] which states that spare parts have to be available for any set period of time,&lt;ref&gt;UK White Goods, [http://www.ukwhitegoods.co.uk/help/buying-advice/all-appliances/255-helpadvice/spare-parts-for-appliances/general-spare-part-help/3473-appliance-spare-parts-and-the-law Appliance Spare Parts Availability and the Law], accessed 10 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; but some [[trade association]]s require their members to ensure products are not rendered useless because spare parts are not available.&lt;ref&gt;What consumer, [http://whatconsumer.co.uk/how-long-should-it-last/#.V9Ym6vkrLIV How long should it last?], accessed 12 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The 'six year rule' in the UK [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] relates to the time period for enforcing claims that goods where [[product defect|defective]] when sold, not to whether spare parts are available to repair them, and section 23(3) of the [[Consumer Rights Act 2015]] states that a [[consumer]] cannot require a trader to repair or replace goods if "the repair or replacement is impossible", implying that if spare parts are no longer available the consumer's right to repair (or to have a spare part supplied) would be lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/pdfs/ukpga_20150015_en.pdf Consumer Rights Act 2015], section 23(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repair cycle==
&lt;!-- {{main|Repair cycle}} --&gt;

From the perspective of [[logistics]], a model of the life cycle of parts in a [[supply chain]] can be developed. This model, called the repair cycle, consists of functioning parts in use by equipment operators, and the entire sequence of [[supply chain management|suppliers]] or repair providers that replenish functional part inventories, either by production or repair, when they have failed. Ultimately, this sequence ends with the [[original equipment manufacturer|manufacturer]]. This type of model allows demands on a supply system to ultimately be traced to their operational [[reliability engineering|reliability]], allowing for analysis of the dynamics of the supply system, in particular, spare parts.

==Inventory management==
{{main|Logistic engineering|Supply chain management}}

===Cannibalization===
{{main|Cannibalization (parts)}}

When [[stockout]] conditions occur, '''cannibalization''' can result. This is the practice of removing parts or subsystems necessary for repair from another similar device, rather than from [[inventory]]. The source system is usually crippled as a result, if only temporarily, in order to allow the recipient device to function properly again. As a result, [[availability|operational availability]] is impaired.

==Commercial==
[[Industrialization]] has seen the widespread growth of commercial [[manufacturing]] enterprises, such as the [[automotive industry]], and later, the [[computer industry]]. The resulting complex systems have evolved modular support infrastructures, with the reliance on [[auto parts]] in the automotive industry, and replaceable computer modules known as [[field-replaceable unit]]s (FRUs).

==Military==
{{main|Military logistics}}

Military operations are significantly affected by [[logistics]] operations. The system availability, also known as [[availability|mission capable rate]], of [[weapon system]]s and the ability to effect the repair of damaged equipment are significant contributors to the success of military operations. Systems that are in a mission-incapable (MICAP) status due lack of spare parts are said to be "awaiting parts" (AWP), also known as not mission capable due to supply (NMCS).

Because of this sensitivity to logistics, militaries have sought to make their [[military logistics|logistics]] operations as effective as possible, focusing effort on [[operations research]] and [[optimal maintenance]]. Maintenance has been simplified by the introduction of interchangeable [[modules]] known as [[line-replaceable unit]]s (LRUs). LRUs make it possible to quickly replace an unserviceable (failed) part with a serviceable (working) replacement. This makes it relatively straightforward to repair complex military hardware, at the expense of having a ready supply of spare parts.

The cost of having serviceable parts available in inventory can be tremendous, as items that are prone to failure may be demanded frequently from inventory, requiring significant inventory levels to avoid depletion. For military programs, the cost of spare inventory can be a significant portion of [[Military acquisition|acquisition cost]].

In recent years, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) has advocated the use of [[performance-based logistics]] (PBL) contracts to manage costs for support of weapon systems.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

[[File:Note stems.png|thumb|Musical stems may go either way upon the middle line; generally, lower than this they go up and the higher than this they go down.]]

In [[musical notation]], '''stems''' are the, "thin, vertical [[line (geometry)|lines]] that are directly connected to the [[notehead|[note] head]]&lt;!--the source spells "note head" as two words--&gt;."&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', p.14. Seventh Edition. McGraw Hill. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stems may point up or down. Different-pointing stems indicate the [[voice (music)|voice]] for [[polyphonic]] music written on the same [[staff (music)|staff]]. Within one voice, the stems usually point down for notes on the middle line or higher, and up for those below. If the stem points up from a notehead, the stem originates from the right-hand side of the note, but if it points down, it originates from the left. There is an exception to this rule: if a [[chord (music)|chord]] contains a [[Interval number|second]], the stem runs between the two notes with the higher being placed on the right of the stem and the lower on the left. If the chord contains an odd numbered cluster of notes a second apart (such as C, D, E), the outer two will be on the correct side of the stem, while the middle note will be on the wrong side.

The length of a stem should be that of an octave on the staff,&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt; going to either an octave higher or lower than the notehead, depending on which way the stem is pointing. If a note head is on a [[ledger lines|ledger line]] more than an octave away from the middle line of a staff, the stem will be elongated to touch the middle line. In any polyphonic music in which two parts are written on the same staff, stems are typically shortened to keep the music visually centered upon the staff.

[[File:Music-tremolo.png|90px|right]]
Stems may be altered in various ways to alter the rhythm or other method of performance. For example, a note with diagonal slashes through its stem is played [[tremolo]].

'''''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings''''' (1951)&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Thiele, ''The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings'', (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951;  2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). {{ISBN|0-8254-3825-X}}, 9780825438257&lt;/ref&gt; is a reconstruction of the chronology of the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|kingdoms of Israel and Judah]] by [[Edwin R. Thiele]]. The book was originally his doctoral dissertation and is widely regarded as the definitive work on the chronology of [[History_of_ancient_Israel_and_Judah#Iron_Age_II_.281000.E2.80.93587.C2.A0BCE.29|Hebrew Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;Thiele's chronology is accepted in several recent study Bibles, and is the chronology used for the Hebrew monarchs in the ''Cambridge Ancient History'' (T. C. Mitchell, "Israel and Judah until the Revolt of Jehu (931-841 B.C.)" ''CAH'' 3, Part 1, p. 445). Thiele's chronology with the slight modifications of Leslie McFall, ("A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles," ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 [1991], pp. 3-45) is accepted in Jack Finegan's influential ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'', rev. ed. (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 1998), p. 249. See also, in the notes below, the list of scholars who accept his date for the beginning of the divided kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is considered the classic and comprehensive work in reckoning the accession of kings, calendars, and co-regencies, based on biblical and extra-biblical sources.

==Biblical chronology ==
The chronology of the kings of Israel and Judah rests primarily on a series of reign lengths and cross references within the books of Kings and Chronicles, in which the accession of each king is dated in terms of the reign of his contemporary in either the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] or the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], and fitting them into the chronology of other ancient civilizations.

However, some of the biblical cross references did not seem to match, so that a reign which is said to have lasted for 20 years results in a cross reference that would give a result of either 19 or 21 years. Thiele noticed that the cross references given during the long reign of King [[Asa of Judah]] had a cumulative error of 1 year for each succeeding reign of the kings of Israel: the first cross-reference resulted in an error of 1 year, the second gave an error of 2 years, the third of 3 years and so on. He explained this pattern as a result of two different methods of reckoning regnal years: the ''accession year'' method in one and the ''non-accession year'' method in the other. Under the accession year method, if a king died in the middle of a year, the period to the end of that year would be called the "accession year" of the new king, whose Year 1 would begin at the new year. Under the non-accession year method the period to the end of the year would be Year 1 of the new king and Year 2 would begin at the start of the new year. Israel appears to have used the non-accession method, while Judah used the accession method until [[Athaliah]] seized power in Judah, when Israel's non-accession method appears to have been adopted in Judah.

In addition, Thiele also concluded that Israel counted years starting in the spring month of [[Nisan]], while Judah counted years starting in the autumn month of [[Tishri]]. The cumulative impact of differing new years and different methods of calculating reigns explained, to Thiele, most of the apparent inconsistencies in the cross references.

Unknown to Thiele when he first published his findings, these same conclusions that the northern kingdom used non-accession years and a spring New Year while the southern kingdom used accession years and a fall New Year had been discovered by [[Valerius Coucke]] of Belgium some years previously, a fact which Thiele acknowledges in his ''Mysterious Numbers''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mysterious Numbers'', 3rd ed., p. 59, n. 17, citing V. Coucke, "Chronique biblique," in ''Supplément au Dictionnaire de la Bible'', ed. Louis Pirot, vol. 1, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusions==
Based on his conclusions, Thiele showed that the 14 years between [[Ahab]] and [[Jehu]] were really 12 years. This enabled him to date their reigns precisely, for [[Ahab]] is mentioned in the [[Kurkh Monolith|Kurk Stele]] which records the Assyrian advance into Syria/Israel at the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC, and Jehu is mentioned on the [[Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]] paying tribute in 841 BC. As these two events are dated by Assyrian chronology as being 12 years apart, Ahab must have fought the Assyrians in his last year and Jehu paid tribute in his first year.

Thiele was able to reconcile the Biblical chronological data from the books of Kings and Chronicles with the exception of synchronisms between [[Hoshea]] of Israel and [[Hezekiah]] of Judah towards the end of the kingdom of Israel and reluctantly concluded that at that point the ancient authors had made a mistake. Oddly, it is at that precise point that he himself makes a mistake, by failing to realize that Hezekiah had a coregency with his father Ahaz, which explains the Hoshea/Hezekiah synchronisms. This correction has been supplied by subsequent writers who built on Thiele’s work, including Thiele’s colleague [[Siegfried Horn]],&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried H. Horn, "The Chronology of King Hezekiah’s Reign," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 2 (1964) pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; TC Mitchell and [[Kenneth Kitchen]],&lt;ref&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'', 1st ed., JD Douglas, editor; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1962, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; and Leslie McFall.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf | first = Leslie | last = McFall | title = Translation Guide | page = 12 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5rKrw27MI?url=http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf | archivedate = 2010-07-19 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thiele's method in arriving at his chronology has been contrasted with the analytical method employed by [[Julius Wellhausen]] and other scholars who follow some form of the [[documentary hypothesis]]. Wellhausen taught that the chronological data of the books of Kings and Chronicles were artificially put together at a date much later than the events they were ostensibly describing and were basically not historical.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Wellhausen, ''Prolegomena to the History of Israel'' (New York: Meridian Books, 1957) p. 151, originally published as ''Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels'' (Berlin: Reimer, 1878).&lt;/ref&gt; This was a necessary consequence of his ''a priori'' assumption that the biblical books as we have them today were the work of late-date editors who could not possibly have known the correct history of the times they were writing about. Theodore Robinson summarized this position as follows: "Wellhausen is surely right in believing that the synchronisms in Kings are worthless, being merely a late compilation from the actual figures given."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore H. Robinson, ''A History of Israel'' (Oxford, 1932) I, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellhausen's methodology in interpreting the Scriptures and the history of Israel has therefore been classed by RK Harrison as a deductive approach; that is, one that starts with presuppositions and derives a historical reconstruction from those presuppositions.&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Harrison, "The Critical Use of the OT," ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' (Jan–Mar 1989) pp. 12–20.&lt;/ref&gt; A necessary consequence of this approach has been that no general agreement has been reached on the chronology of the Hebrew kingdom period as calculated by authors who adopted this method. "The disadvantage of the deductive approach is that nothing is settled for certain; the results obtained are as diverse as the [[presupposition (philosophy)|presupposition]]s of the scholars, since diverse presuppositions produce diverse results."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Rodger C | last = Young | contribution = Inductive and Deductive Methods as Applied to OT Chronology | title = [[The Master's Seminary Journal]] | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | year = 2007 | page = 102 | format = PDF | contribution-url = http://www.tms.edu/tmsj/tmsj18e.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Thiele's method of determining the chronology of the Hebrew kings was based on induction, that is, making it a matter of first priority to determine the actual methods used by ancient scribes and court recorders in recording the years of kings, as described above. Thiele's inductive method, then, was based on inscriptional evidence from the ancient Near East, and not on the presuppositions followed by liberal scholarship. It is Thiele's method that has produced the determinative studies for the chronology of the kingdom period, not the presupposition-based method, so that even those interpreters who continue in late-date theories for the authorship of Scripture have recognized the credibility of Thiele's scholarship in determining the date for the division of the kingdom after the death of Solomon, as cited above. The work of Thiele and other textual scholars who have followed an inductive (evidence-based) approach is therefore significant in providing an alternative to the methods of the documentary hypothesis, and the success of that approach has been seen as theologically significant in supporting a high view of the inspiration of Scripture, particularly regarding its integrity in the abundant and complex historical data related to the kingdom period.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the chronological data of the MT [ [[Masoretic text]] ] were not authentic—the actual dates and synchronisms for these various kings—then neither Thiele nor McFall nor anyone else could have constructed a chronology from them that in every case is faithful to the original texts and in every proven instance is consistent with Assyrian and Babylonian chronology. This mathematical demonstration should sit in judgment over the various theories of text formation: If a theory of text formation cannot explain how the chronological data of the MT has produced a chronology that in every respect seems authentic for the four centuries of the monarchic period, then that theory must be rejected as another example of a presupposition-based approach that cannot meet the rational criteria for credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger C. Young, review of Christine Tetley's ''The Reconstructed Chronology of the Divided Kingdom'' (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2005), in ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 45:2 (2007), pp. 282-283 ([http://home.swbell.net/rcyoung8/TetleyReview.rtf Link]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception==

Thiele's chronological reconstruction has not been accepted by all scholars,&lt;ref&gt;'Not all scholars are convinced by this solution, and commentators on the prophetic books often accept that dates can only be approximate.', McConville, G (2002). Exploring the Old Testament, Volume 4: The Prophets (viii).  London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Despite that fact of scholarly dedication, neither Thiele’s carefully argued University of Chicago dissertation, nor anyone else’s, has achieved as yet universal acceptance.', Kaiser, WC (1998). A history of Israel: From the bronze age through the Jewish Wars (293). Nashville, TN: Broadman &amp; Holman Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; nor has any other scholar’s work in this field. Yet the work of Thiele and those who followed in his steps has achieved acceptance across a wider spectrum than that of any comparable chronology, so that Assyriologist [[Donald Wiseman|DJ Wiseman]] wrote “The chronology most widely accepted today is one based on the meticulous study by Thiele,”&lt;ref&gt;Donald J Wiseman, ''1 and 2 Kings'' in ''[[Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries]]'' (Leicester: Intervarsity, 1993), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, Leslie McFall: “Thiele’s chronology is fast becoming the consensus view among Old Testament scholars, if it has not already reached that point.”&lt;ref&gt;Leslie McFall, “The Chronology of Saul and David,” ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' 53 (2010) 215, n. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Although criticism has been leveled at numerous specific points in his chronology,&lt;ref&gt;'but his harmonizing approach has not gone unchallenged, especially because of the many shifts in the basis of reckoning dates that it requires (e.g., Jepsen 1968: 34–35)—shifts which were unlikely in actual practice.', Freedman, DN (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; his work has won considerable praise even from those who disagree with his final conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;'Driver described Thiele’s system as an “important work, which comes very near to, if it does not actually reach, a final solution of the problem of the dates of the kings of Israel and Judah.”  Even a critic of Thiele’s system who accused him of manipulating variable factors to achieve his goal of fitting the biblical evidence into Near Eastern history and who described his work as “more a study in numerical ingenuity than in scholarly research” had to admit that “Thiele’s assumption is validated by the results achieved: inner consistency and harmony and conformity with the fixed dates of ancient Near Eastern history.”', McFall, Leslie, 'A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles', Bibliotheca Sacra Volume 148. 1991 (589) (4). Dallas, TX: Dallas Theological Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, even scholars sharing Thiele's religious convictions have maintained that there are weaknesses in his argument such as unfounded assumptions and assumed circular reasoning.

{{quote |In his desire to resolve the discrepancies between the data in the Book of Kings, Thiele was forced to make improbable suppositions…  There is no basis for Thiele's statement that his conjectures are correct because he succeeded in reconciling most of the data in the Book of Kings, since his assumptions… are derived from the chronological data themselves…"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=QkgEaWG0_j4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+chronology+of+the+kings+of+Israel+and+Judah#v=onepage&amp;q=Temple&amp;f=false | first = Gershon | last = Galil | title = The Chronology of the Kings of Israel and Judah | publisher = Brill | year = 1996 | page = 4| isbn = 9004106111 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'The numerous extrabiblical synchronisms he invokes do not always reflect the latest refinements in Assyriological research (cf. E.2.f below). In many cases, he posits an undocumented event in order to save a biblical datum (e.g., the circumstances surrounding the appointment of Jeroboam II as coregent; Thiele 1983: 109)', Freedman, DN (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This citation, from a critic of Thiele's system, demonstrates the difference mentioned above between the deductive approach based on presuppositions and an inductive approach based on data, not a priori assumptions. Thiele is criticized here for basing his theories on data or evidence, not on presuppositions.

Despite these criticisms Thiele's methodological treatment remains the typical starting point of scholarly treatments of the subject,&lt;ref&gt;'Thiele’s work has become a cornerstone of much recent chronological discussion (cf. De Vries IDB 1: 580–99; IDBSup: 161–66);', Freedman, D. N. (1996).  Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; and his work is considered to have established the date of the division of the Israelite kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;'Following Thiele’s revolutionary work, The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, a consensus has emerged that the kingdom under Solomon divided at his death in 931 BC.  This date must be the starting point for any chronological reconstruction of previous events.', Merrill, Eugene H, ‘Fixed Dates in Patriarchal Chronology’, Bibliotheca Sacra Volume 137. 1980 (547) (237). Dallas, TX: Dallas Theological Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finegan, ''Handbook'' p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gershon Galil]], ''The Chronology of the Kings of Israel and Judah'' (Leiden: Brill, 1996), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McFall, "Translation Guide," p. 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T. C. Mitchell in ''Cambridge Ancient History'', "Israel and Judah until the Revolt of Jehu," pp. 445-446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman, ''The Bible Unearthed'' (New York: Free Press, 2001), p. 131 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=lu6ywyJr0CMC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=Finkelstein+%22Bible+Unearthed%22+931&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lQA3Mtd86F&amp;sig=TbXfcHSMjYvizXXLb_jqKnluap8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sKzSSbG2B8nfnQf1n-jJBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Link]).&lt;/ref&gt; This has found independent support in the work of J. Liver,&lt;ref&gt;J. Liver, "The Chronology of Tyre at the Beginning of the First Millennium B.C.," ''Israel Exploration Journal'' 3 (1953), p. 113-120&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Moore Cross|Frank M. Cross]],&lt;ref&gt;Frank M. Cross, "An Interpretation of the Nora Stone," ''Bulletin of the American School of Oriental Research'' 208 (1972) p. 17, n. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and others studying the chronology of the kings of Tyre.&lt;ref&gt;A summary of these studies is found in William H. Barnes, ''Studies in the Chronology of the Divided Monarchy of Israel'' (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1991), pp. 29-55, and also in Rodger C. Young, "Three Verifications of Thiele's Date for the Beginning of the Divided Kingdom," ''Andrews University Seminary Studies'' 45 (2007), pp. 179-187.&lt;/ref&gt; Thiele's work has found widespread recognition and use across various related scholarly disciplines. His date of 931 BCE, in conjunction with the synchronism between Rehoboam and Pharaoh [[Shoshenq I|Shishak]] in 1 Kings 14:25, is used by Egyptologists to give absolute dates to Egypt’s [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|22nd Dynasty]], and his work has also been used by scholars in other disciplines to establish Assyrian and Babylonian dates.&lt;ref&gt;'In a 1996 article, Kenneth Strand wrote, “What has generally not been given due notice is the effect that Thiele’s clarification of the Hebrew chronology of this period of history has had in furnishing a corrective for various dates in ancient Assyrian and Babylonian history.”28  The purpose of Strand’s article was to show that Thiele’s methodology accomplished more than just producing a coherent chronology from scriptural data. His chronology, once produced, proved useful in settling some troublesome problems in Assyrian and Babylonian history. As Strand pointed out, this outcome was quite the opposite of what some of Thiele’s critics asserted, namely that Thiele merely juggled the scriptural data until he could match generally accepted dates from the surrounding nations.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (112–113). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Thiele's reconstruction led to further research which has refined or even departed from his synthesis. Notable studies of this type include work by Tadmor&lt;ref&gt;'H. Tadmor (EncMiqr 4: 245–310) bases his chronology upon considerations similar to those of Begrich and Thiele, but assumes far fewer systemic fluctuations; items which are inexplicable are regarded as late editorial calculations or errors.', Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'While also somewhat conservative in his approach to the figures in MT, Tadmor’s pragmatic reconstruction delves into the process by which the redactor(s) of Kings compiled their chronological framework from heterogeneous materials, sometimes leaving traces in textual inconsistencies (Tadmor EncMiqr 4: 45).', Freedman, D. N. (1996). Vol. 1: The Anchor Yale Bible Dictionary (1006). New York: Doubleday.&lt;/ref&gt; and McFall.&lt;ref&gt;'It remained then for others to complete the application of principles that Thiele used elsewhere, thereby providing a chronology for the eighth-century kings of Judah that is in complete harmony with the reign lengths and synchronisms given in 2 Kings and 2 Chronicles. The most thorough work in this regard was Leslie McFall’s 1991 article in Bibliotheca Sacra.22  McFall made his way through the reign lengths and synchronisms of Kings and Chronicles, and using an exact notation that indicated whether the years were being measured according to Judah’s Tishri years or Israel’s Nisan years, he was able to produce a chronology for the divided monarchies that was consistent with all the scriptural texts chosen.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (105–106). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholarly attitudes towards the Biblical record of the Israelite monarchies from the late nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century were largely disparaging, treating the records as essentially fictional and dismissing the value of the regnal synchronisms.&lt;ref&gt;'R. Kittel: “Wellhausen has shown, by convincing reasons, that the synchronisms within the Book of Kings cannot possibly rest on ancient tradition, but are on the contrary simply the products of artificial reckoning.. . .”5 Theodore H. Robinson: “Wellhausen is surely right in believing that the synchronisms in Kings are worthless, being merely a late compilation from the actual figures given.”6 S. R. and G. R. Driver: “Since, however, it is clear on various grounds that these synchronisms are not original, any attempt to base a chronological scheme on them may be disregarded.”7 Karl Marti: “Almost along the whole line, the discrepancy between synchronisms and years of reign is incurable.”8 TMSJ 18:1 (Spring 2007) p. 102 Cyrus Gordon: “The numerical errors in the Books of Kings have defied every attempt to ungarble them. Those errors are largely the creation of the editors. . . . [T]he editors did not execute the synchronisms skillfully.”9', Young, Roger C, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' Volume 48. 2005 (2) (233). Lynchburg, VA: The Evangelical Theological Society.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, modern scholarly attitudes to the monarchical chronology and synchronisms in 1 and 2 Kings has been far more positive subsequent to the work of Thiele and those who have developed his thesis further,&lt;ref&gt;' The most thorough work in this regard was Leslie McFall’s 1991 article in Bibliotheca Sacra.22  McFall made his way through the reign lengths and synchronisms of Kings and Chronicles, and using an exact notation that indicated whether the years were being measured according to Judah’s Tishri years or Israel’s Nisan years, he was able to produce a chronology for the divided monarchies that was consistent with all the scriptural texts chosen. That was the logical outgrowth of Thiele’s work, and it attained a holy grail that had been sought for twenty-two centuries, namely a rational explanation of the chronological data of the Hebrew monarchies that was consistent with the scriptural texts used to construct the chronology, and also consistent with several fixed dates from Assyrian and Babylonian history.', Young, Roger, 'Inductive And Deductive Methods As Applied To OT Chronology', Master's Seminary Journal Volume 18. 2007 (1) (105–106). Sun Valley, CA: The Master's Seminary.&lt;/ref&gt; a change in attitude to which recent archaeology has contributed.&lt;ref&gt;'Grabbe suggests that the names and sequence of kings in Israel and Judah, and their approximate chronological placement, agrees with what can be gleaned from extra-biblical sources. To this extent the biblical framework (meaning primarily 1 and 2 Kings) is reliable: even if we had no external sources we could have reasonable confidence in the biblical sequence of Jeroboam I, Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Omri, Ahab, Jehu, etc. in Samaria, and David, Solomon, Rehoboam, Abijam, Asa, Jehoshaphat, etc. in Jerusalem, along with their interrelationships. Beyond that it starts to get more and more tricky, with decreasing reliability in the biblical narrative as the detail increases (this is a general statement, and there are sometimes exceptions in specific instances).', Grabbe, L. L. (2007). Reflections on the Discussion. In L. L. Grabbe (Ed.), Ahab Agonistes: The Rise and Fall of the Omri Dynasty (L. L. Grabbe, Ed.) (337). London: T&amp;T Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1964 to 1984: The first campus of VNUF was located in the evacuated area of [[Đông_Triều_District|Dong Trieu] district], [[Quảng_Ninh_Province|Quang Ninh province]]. The task of VNUF was to train and provide human resources of undergraduate with three academic faculties and four majors of forestry.
From 1984 until now: The main campus was located at Xuan Mai town, Chuong My district, Hanoi, becoming a university with diversified training and education activities to meet social needs and to fulfill the duty of national scientific technology
The second campus (established in 01/2008) is located in Trang Bong Town, Dong Nai province, [[Vietnam]] that was upgraded from the Forestry College 2 - [[Ministry_of_Agriculture_and_Rural_Development_(Vietnam)|Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development]] to meet the demand for human resources in forestry for the southern provinces of the country.
Today VNUF activities expanded to five Academic Faculties with hundreds departments, 36 major subjects.
Over the years, more than 1,000 masters, 150 doctors, over 10,000 undergraduate students, and 500 trainees with intermediate and primary level have graduated from VNUF. 
Likewise, the VNUF has helped establish more than 30 universities, training and research institutions in different countries, as well as international organizations.

==Facilities==

VNUF has 160 hectares in the main campus and 20 hectares in the second branch for serving its training and science research purposes.
6 experimental centers with 58 labs for testing and practice,
10,800 m2 of classrooms,
A library of 3,000 m2 with 150,000 books/textbooks and other electronic sources for reference.
Nearly 100 ha of experimental forests for training and science research.
16 high buildings which provide accommodation with self-contained rooms for nearly 8,000 students.
The sport areas and recreation centers including gymnasiums, outdoor swimming pool, sport ground, house of culture, etc., have the area of 20,000 m2.

==Organization Structure==

The Vietnam National University of Forestry has 3 organizational levels: a) Board of Leaders, b) Faculties &amp; Administrative Divisions, and c) Organizations.

07 Faculties/Colleges
09 Administrative Divisions.
05 Research &amp; Production Units.
01 Company of Consulting, Investment &amp; Forestry Development (CIFOD).

The '''virgin cleansing myth''' (also referred to as the '''virgin cure myth''', '''virgin rape myth''', or simply '''virgin myth''') is the belief that having [[sexual intercourse|sex]] with a [[virgin]] [[girl]] cures a man of [[HIV/AIDS]] or other [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name="Groce &amp; Trasi 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Rape of individuals with disability: AIDS and the folk belief of virgin cleansing | journal = The Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9422 | year = 2004 | pages = 1663–1664 | author = Groce, Nora E. | author2 = Trasi, Reshma | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604162880 | accessdate = 2011-12-29 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16288-0 | pmid=15158626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologist Suzanne Leclerc-Madlala says the [[myth]] is a potential factor in [[infant rape]] by HIV-positive men in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Leclerc-Madlala 2002"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = On The Virgin Cleansing Myth: Gendered Bodies, AIDS and Ethnomedicine | journal = African Journal of AIDS Research | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | year = 2002 | pages = 87–95 | author = Leclerc-Madlala, Suzanne | url = http://scnc.ukzn.ac.za/doc/Health/Aids/LeclercMadlala-S_Virgin_cleansing_myth_HIV-AIDS_ethnomedicine.pdf | accessdate = 2011-12-29 | doi=10.2989/16085906.2002.9626548| pmid = 25871812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to young girls, who are presumed to be virgins because of their age, people who are "blind, deaf, physically impaired, intellectually disabled, or who have mental-health disabilities" are sometimes raped under the erroneous presumption that individuals with disabilities are sexually inactive and therefore virgins.&lt;ref name="Groce &amp; Trasi 2004" /&gt;

==History==
The myth was first reported in 16th century [[Europe]] and gained prominence in 19th century [[Victorian England]] as a cure for [[syphilis]] and [[gonorrhea]] among other sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name="Earl-Taylor 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = HIV/AIDS, the stats, the virgin cure and infant rape | journal = Science in Africa: Africa's First On-Line Science Magazine | year = 2002 | author = Earl-Taylor, Mike | url = http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2002/april/virgin.htm | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120115094218/http://www.scienceinafrica.co.za/2002/april/virgin.htm | archive-date = 2012-01-15 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The origin is unknown, but historian [[Hanne Blank]] writes that the idea may have evolved from [[Christian]] legends of [[Consecrated virgin|virgin]]–[[Christian martyrs|martyrs]], whose purity served as a form of protection in battling [[demon]]s.&lt;ref name="Blank 2007"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Virgin: The Untouched History | author = Blank, Hanne | year = 2007 | publisher = Bloomsbury USA | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-59691-010-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
People all over the world have heard this myth, including in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], [[Asia]], Europe and the Americas.&lt;ref name="Groce &amp; Trasi 2004" /&gt;

A survey by the [[UNISA|University Of South Africa (UNISA)]] in South Africa found that 18 percent of laborers thought that having sex with a virgin cures HIV/AIDS. An earlier study in 1999 by sexual health educators in [[Gauteng]] reported that 32 percent of the survey participants believed the myth.&lt;ref name="IRIN 2002"&gt;{{Cite news | title = SOUTH AFRICA: Focus on the virgin myth and HIV/AIDS | author = IRIN | year = 2002 | publisher = IRIN | url = http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=39838 | accessdate = 2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Betty Makoni of the Girl Child Network in Zimbabwe, the myth is perpetuated by traditional healers advising HIV-positive men to cure their disease by having sex with virgin girls.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2006"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Staging sex myths to save Zimbabwe's girls | author = Vickers, Steve | publisher = BBC | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6076758.stm | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | date=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Zimbabwe, some people also believe that the blood produced by raping a virgin will cleanse the infected person's blood of the disease.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2006" /&gt;

In 2002, psychologist Mike Earl-Taylor wrote that the virgin cure myth may explain the staggering rise in child or infant rapes in [[South Africa]], which is facing an HIV/AIDS [[epidemic]].&lt;ref name="Earl-Taylor 2003" /&gt; [[UNICEF]] has attributed the rape of hundreds of girls to the virgin cleansing myth.&lt;ref name="CNN 2009"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Child rape survivor saves 'virgin myth' victims | author = CNN | publisher = CNN | url = http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-04/living/cnnheroes.betty.makoni_1_young-girls-raped-youngest-girl?_s=PM:LIVING | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | date = 2009-10-01 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120127030305/http://articles.cnn.com/2009-06-04/living/cnnheroes.betty.makoni_1_young-girls-raped-youngest-girl?_s=PM%3ALIVING | archive-date = 2012-01-27 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is unknown exactly how common the myth is and to what degree rapes happen because of the belief in it. The claim that the myth drives either HIV infection or [[child sexual abuse]] in Africa is disputed by researchers [[Rachel Jewkes]] and Helen Epstein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61858-4/fulltext |title=The myth of the virgin rape myth |date=2009-10-24  |accessdate=2013-09-21 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61858-4 |volume=374 |issue=9699 |journal=The Lancet |page=1419|last1=Epstein |first1=Helen |last2=Jewkes |first2=Rachel }} "In the current South African case, this claim is predicated on racist assumptions about the amorality of African men..."&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by research on convicted sex offenders in Malawi, where no evidence was found to support the idea that the virgin cleansing myth prompted any rapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mtibo C, Kennedy N, Umar E |title=Explanations for child sexual abuse given by convicted offenders in Malawi: no evidence for "HIV cleansing" |journal=Child Abuse Negl |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=142–6 |year=2011 |pmid=21353703 |doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2010.10.001 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of education==
Ignorance with regards to HIV and AIDS infection serves as a barrier to prevention in numerous African nations.&lt;ref name="Connor 1999"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Focus AIDS: The myth that sex with a virgin can cure HIV | author = Connor, Steve | publisher = The Independent | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/focus-aids-the-myth-that-sex-with-a-virgin-can-cure-hiv-1116662.html | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | location=London | date=1999-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education has helped women such as [[Betty Makoni]] speak out against the myth and attempt to dissuade people from believing the virgin cleansing myth.&lt;ref name="Mullins 2009"&gt;{{Cite news | title = 'Virgin Myth' Behind Zimbabwe Child Rapes | author = Mullins, K.J. | year = 2009 | publisher = Digital Journal | url = http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/273698 | accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stein 2009"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Silver Linings: One Woman Takes On The 'Virgin Myth.' Many Others Perpetuate It | author = Stein, Sadie | year = 2009 | publisher = Jezebel | url = http://jezebel.com/5283195/silver-linings-one-woman-takes-on-the-virgin-myth-many-others-perpetuate-it | accessdate = 2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNICEF, culture-based gender roles that prize innocence and ignorance in girls and that accept [[sexual licentiousness]] in men promote this myth.  Other cultural factors, such as girls being married to older men, increase the likelihood of  HIV [[transmission (medicine)|transmission]] {{Citation needed|reason=Who says, what in particular.  Age differential increases HIV percentages?|date=April 2017}}. The stigma attached to AIDS also stops many people from seeking information or [[health services]] to shield their [[Social status|status]], contributing to further transmission.&lt;ref name="UNICEF 2003"&gt;{{Cite report | title = Faith-Motivated Actions on HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care for Children and Young People in South Asia: A Regional Overview | author = UNICEF Regional Office for South Asia | date = 2003 | publisher = UNICEF | url = http://www.unicef.org/rosa/Faith.pdf | accessdate = 2011-12-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121017210410/http://www.unicef.org/rosa/Faith.pdf | archivedate = 2012-10-17 | deadurl = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The virgin cleansing myth is referenced in the Broadway musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]''. The minor character Mattumbo is stopped from raping a baby based on the belief that sex with a virgin will cure his AIDS. During the song "Making Things Up Again", Elder Cunningham tells Mattumbo that raping babies is against God's will, and invents a passage in the [[Book of Mormon]] in which God tells [[Joseph Smith]] to instead have sex with a frog to cure his AIDS.

A '''vortex generator''' ('''VG''') is an [[aerodynamic]] device, consisting of a small [[wikt:vane|vane]] usually attached to a lifting surface (or [[airfoil]], such as an [[aircraft|aircraft wing]])&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt; or a rotor blade of a [[wind turbine]].&lt;ref name="WindTurbineVortexGenerators"&gt;[http://www.upwindsolutions.com/upgrades/wind-turbine-vortex-generator/ Wind Turbine Vortex Generators], UpWind Solutions.&lt;/ref&gt; VGs may also be attached to some part of an aerodynamic vehicle such as an aircraft fuselage or a car.  When the airfoil or the body is in motion relative to the air, the VG creates a [[vortex]],&lt;ref name="Peppler"&gt;Peppler, I.L.: ''From The Ground Up'', page 23. Aviation Publishers Co. Limited, Ottawa Ontario, Twenty Seventh Revised Edition, 1996. {{ISBN|0-9690054-9-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroHow"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.microaero.com/pages/v_howvgswrk.html|title = How Micro VGs Work|accessdate = 2008-03-15|last = Micro AeroDynamics|authorlink = |year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which, by removing some part of the slow-moving boundary layer in contact with the airfoil surface, delays local [[flow separation]] and [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|aerodynamic stalling]], thereby improving the effectiveness of wings and [[Wing configuration#Tailplanes and foreplanes|control surfaces]], such as [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]], [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]], [[aileron]]s, and [[rudder]]s.&lt;ref name="MicroHow"/&gt;

==Method of operation==
Vortex generators are most often used to delay [[flow separation]].  To accomplish this they are often placed on the external surfaces of vehicles&lt;ref name="Clancy"&gt;Clancy, L.J. ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.31&lt;/ref&gt; and wind turbine blades. On both aircraft and wind turbine blades they are usually installed quite close to the leading edge of the [[airfoil|aerofoil]] in order to maintain steady airflow over the control surfaces at the trailing edge.&lt;ref name="MicroHow"/&gt; VGs are typically rectangular or triangular, about as tall as the local [[boundary layer]], and run in spanwise lines usually near the thickest part of the wing.&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt; They can be seen on the wings and vertical tails of many [[airliner]]s.

Vortex generators are positioned obliquely so that they have an [[angle of attack]] with respect to the local airflow&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt; in order to create a tip vortex which draws energetic, rapidly moving outside air into the slow-moving boundary layer in contact with the surface. A turbulent boundary layer is less likely to separate than a laminar one, and is therefore desirable to ensure effectiveness of trailing-edge control surfaces. Vortex generators are used to trigger this transition. Other devices such as [[vortilon]]s, [[leading-edge extension]]s, [[leading edge cuff]]s,&lt;ref&gt;A drooped leading edge presents a "vortex-producing discontinuity", in "Spin Resistance Development for Small Airplanes", SAE paper 2000-01-1691&lt;/ref&gt; also delay flow separation at high angles of attack by re-energizing the boundary layer.&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroHow"/&gt;

Examples of aircraft which use VGs include the [[Embraer 170]] and [[Symphony SA-160]]. For swept-wing transonic designs, VGs alleviate potential [[shock-stall]] problems (e.g., [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]], [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], [[Gloster Javelin]]).

==Aftermarket installation==
Many aircraft carry vane vortex generators from time of manufacture, but there are also aftermarket suppliers who sell VG kits to improve the [[STOL]] performance of some light aircraft.&lt;ref name="Micro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.microaero.com/|title = Micro Vortex Generators for Single and Twin Engine Aircraft|accessdate = 2008-03-15|last = Micro AeroDynamics|authorlink = |year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aftermarket suppliers claim (i) that VGs lower stall speed and reduce take-off and landing speeds, and (ii) that VGs increase the effectiveness of ailerons, elevators and rudders, thereby improving controllability and safety at low speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landshorter.com/page2.html |title=Land Shorter! Benefits |publisher=Landshorter.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For home-built and experimental [[homebuilt aircraft|kitplane]]s, VGs are cheap, cost-effective and can be installed quickly; but for certified aircraft installations, [[Type certificate|certification]] costs can be high, making the modification a relatively expensive process.&lt;ref name="Micro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;

Owners fit aftermarket VGs primarily to gain benefits at low speeds, but a downside is that such VGs may reduce cruise speed slightly. In tests performed on a [[Cessna 182]] and a [[Piper Cherokee|Piper PA-28-235 Cherokee]], independent reviewers have documented a loss of cruise speed of {{convert|1.5|to|2.0|kn|km/h|1|abbr=on}} .  However, these losses are relatively minor, since an aircraft wing at high speed has a small angle of attack, thereby reducing VG drag to a minimum.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAMay2003"&gt;Psutka, Kevin, ''Micro-vortex generators'', [[Canadian Owners and Pilots Association|COPA Flight]], August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAJuly2004"&gt;Kirkby, Bob, ''Vortex Generators for the Cherokee 235'', [[Canadian Owners and Pilots Association|COPA Flight]], July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Owners have reported that on the ground, it can be harder to clear snow and ice from wing surfaces with VGs than from a smooth wing, but VGs are not generally prone to inflight icing as they reside within the boundary layer of airflow. VGs may also have sharp edges which can tear the fabric of airframe covers and may thus require special covers to be made.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAMay2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAJuly2004" /&gt;

For twin-engined aircraft, manufacturers claim that VGs reduce single-engine control speed ([[V speeds|Vmca]]), increase zero fuel and gross weight, improve the effectiveness of ailerons and rudder, provide a smoother ride in turbulence and make the aircraft a more stable instrument platform&lt;ref name="Micro" /&gt;

==Increase in maximum takeoff weight==
Some VG kits available for light twin-engine airplanes may allow an increase in [[maximum takeoff weight]].&lt;ref name="Micro"/&gt;  The maximum takeoff weight of a twin-engine airplane is determined by structural requirements and single-engine climb performance requirements (which are lower for a lower stall speed).  For many light twin-engine airplanes, the single-engine climb performance requirements determine a lower maximum weight rather than the structural requirements.  Consequently, anything that can be done to improve the single-engine-inoperative climb performance will bring about an increase in maximum takeoff weight.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;

In the USA from 1945&lt;ref&gt;USA Civil Air Regulations, Part 3, §3.85a&lt;/ref&gt; until 1991,&lt;ref name="FAR23"&gt;USA Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 23, §23.67, amendment 23-42, February 4, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
the one-engine-inoperative climb requirement for multi-engine airplanes with a maximum takeoff weight of {{convert|6000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} or less was as follows:
{{quote|All multi-engine airplanes having a stalling speed &lt;math&gt;V_{s0}&lt;/math&gt; greater than 70 miles per hour shall have a steady rate of climb of at least &lt;math&gt;0.02(V_{s0})^2&lt;/math&gt; in feet per minute at an altitude of 5,000 feet with the critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines operating at not more than maximum continuous power, the inoperative propeller in the minimum drag position, landing gear retracted, wing flaps in the most favorable position …}}
where &lt;math&gt;V_{s0}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] speed in the landing configuration in miles per hour.

Installation of vortex generators can usually bring about a slight reduction in stalling speed of an airplane&lt;ref name="Clancy"/&gt; and therefore reduce the required one-engine-inoperative climb performance.  The reduced requirement for climb performance allows an increase in maximum takeoff weight, at least up to the maximum weight allowed by structural requirements.&lt;ref name="Busch"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/news/reviews/182564-1.html|title = Vortex Generators: Band-Aids or Magic?|accessdate = 2008-03-15|last = Busch|first = Mike|authorlink = |date=November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An increase in maximum weight allowed by structural requirements can usually be achieved by specifying a [[maximum zero fuel weight]] or, if a maximum zero fuel weight is already specified as one of the airplane's limitations, by specifying a new higher maximum zero fuel weight.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;  For these reasons, vortex generator kits for many light twin-engine airplanes are accompanied by a reduction in maximum zero fuel weight and an increase in maximum takeoff weight.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;

The one-engine-inoperative rate-of-climb requirement does not apply to single-engine airplanes, so gains in the maximum takeoff weight (based on stall speed or structural considerations) are less significant compared to those for 1945–1991 twins.

After 1991, the airworthiness certification requirements in the USA specify the one-engine-inoperative climb requirement as a gradient independent of stalling speed, so there is less opportunity for vortex generators to increase the maximum takeoff weight of multi-engine airplanes whose certification basis is FAR 23 at amendment 23-42 or later.&lt;ref name="FAR23"/&gt;

==Maximum landing weight==
Because the landing weights of most light aircraft are determined by structural considerations and not by stall speed, most VG kits increase only the takeoff weight and &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; the landing weight.  Any increase in landing weight would require either structural modifications or re-testing the aircraft at the higher landing weight to demonstrate that the certification requirements are still met.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;  However, after a lengthy flight, sufficient fuel may have been used, thereby bringing the aircraft back below the permitted maximum landing weight.

==Aircraft noise reduction==
Vortex generators have been used on the wing underside of [[Airbus A320 family]] aircraft to reduce noise generated by airflow over circular pressure equalisation vents for the fuel tanks. Lufthansa claims a noise reduction of up to 2&amp;nbsp;dB can thus be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/press/news-releases/singleview/archive/2014/february/12/article/2797.html More than 200 Lufthansa A320 aircraft to become quieter.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504034353/http://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/press/news-releases/singleview/archive/2014/february/12/article/2797.html |date=2014-05-04 }} Retrieved 2014-05-04&lt;/ref&gt;
