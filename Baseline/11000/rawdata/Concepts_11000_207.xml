      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11227">[[Access to public information in Europe|Access to public information]] and [[freedom of information]] (FOI) refer to the right of access to information held by public bodies also known as "right to know". Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' [[accountability]], boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right of access to public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/freedom-of-expression/freedom-of-information|title=Freedom of Information|last=|first=|date=|website=unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The right of access to information in Cyprus is guaranteed in constitutional provisions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] but the legal framework is seriously flawed, with no law on access to information in the Southern [[Republic of Cyprus]] of the country and a law that falls below [[Council of Europe]] standards in the [[Northern Cyprus|Northern part of Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The right to access to public information is provided in different ways in the two parts of the island, in which Cyprus is ''de facto'' divided.

As to 2011, a research by the [[Open Cyprus Project]] showed that there was a level of 75% of [[administrative silence]] island-wide, in response to information requests.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmediafreedom.eu/Publications/Reports/The-Right-of-Access-to-Information-in-Cyprus.-Report-and-Recommendations|title=The Right of Access to Information in Cyprus. Report and Recommendations|last=|first=|date=November 2011|website=rcmediafreedom.eu|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of the respondents to this survey stated that, in practice, access to key documents is not possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since late 2013, a draft law on the Right to Access Public Information is being discussed in the Parliament of the (Southern) Republic of Cyprus. 

'''On 22 December 2017 the law has finally been approved (Law number 184(I)/2017)'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/2017_1_184/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Northern Cyprus ==
The right to access public information is granted by Article No. 24 of the Constitution of Northern Cyprus. Even if the Constitutional article echoes Article No. 10 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR), experts say that the possibilities to restrict the fundamental right of  access to public information are provided in an overbroad manner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Specifically, Article No. 10 (2) ECHR says that the conditions and restrictions imposed on the right to freedom of expression have to be “necessary in a democratic society”. Instead, even if the Constitution of Northern Cyprus- under Article No. 24- provides for a test of whether a restriction to such a right is necessary, it does not specify the key qualification of being necessary in a democratic society, as required by Article 10 of the ECHR.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The relevant laws regulating the right to access public information in the Northern part of Cyprus are: the Right to Access Information Law No. 12 of 2006; the Public Officials Law No. 7 of 1979; the State Procurement Regulation; the Rules and Procedures of the Parliament and the Personal Data Protection Act No. 89 of 2007.

The Right to Access Information Law obliges “public bodies” to process all information requests, regardless of the means by which they are submitted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A 2011 research recommends that, with regard to the Access to Information Law in the Northern part of the country, the scope of the law should be extended to all classes of information held by public bodies. Also, according to experts, an implementing regulation should be approved, clarifying the administrative procedure to request and receive information.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Finally, the Access to Information Assessment Commission foreseen by the law has not been appointed yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/nat/11269|title=Open Cyprus Project: Results|last=|first=|date=February 24, 2011|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Republic of Cyprus ==
The Cypriot government couldn't sign or ratify the 2009 [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on Access to Official Documents]] as it did not have a transparency law that meets the Convention’s minimum standard. Until 2017, Cyprus was the only country in Europe, other than Luxembourg, without a law guaranteeing the right of access to information.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/28182|title=Civil society warn Cyprus’ draft transparency law under threat if excessive exceptions persist|last=|first=|date=March 31, 2017|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But as of 2018, the law has been published (Law 184(I)/2017)

The relevant laws with regard to the right to access public information are the following:
* Article No. 19 and 29 of the Constitution;
* the Act regarding Personal Data N. 138 of 2001, which makes clear that this data can be accessed only by the affected person (s);
* the Act on Re-Use of Existing Information Held by Public Sector Bodies, No. 132 of 2006: it ensures that when the authority grants one user permission to make use of a large volume of information, it must grant other users access on the same  terms;
* the Press Law No. 145 o 1985: it grants a general right of access to all information held by public bodies;
* the Environmental Information Law No. 119 of 2004, which clearly grants access to information on a non- discriminatory basis;
* the State Archives Law No. 208 of 1991, for information held in archives. It does not grant a general public access before a thirty-year period;
* the State Secrets Law No. 2016 of 2002;
* the Public Service Law No. 1 of 1990;
* the Public Procurement Law No.1 of 200;
* the Public Aid Law No. 30 of 2001;
* the Administrative Principles Law No. 158 of 1999.
According to experts, these non-specific laws that might grant access to some classes of information, such as environmental information or archives, require amendments to comply with the basic international and European standards.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since April 2014, the Republic of Cyprus has been holding public consultations aimed at drafting a Freedom of Information Law, which as to 2017 has to be enacted.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2015/10/18/ministry-defends-planned-freedom-of-information-law/|title=Ministry defends planned freedom of information law|last=Psyllides|first=George|date=October 18, 2015|website=cyprus-mail.com|publisher=Cyprus Mail Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the Cypriot Justice Minister [[Ionas Nicolaou]] expressed his commitment to adopt a strong access to information (Freedom of Information) law that will be “one of the best in the [[European Union]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/20942|title=Access Info welcomes Cyprus’ commitment to strong FOI law|last=Pavlou|first=Andreas|date=October 21, 2015|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, in February 2017, the association [[Access Info Europe]] has addressed the Cypriot Parliament asking to review such a draft. In particular, Access Info Europe advocated for the removal of  the fees for making information requests and for cutting down the possible 60 days extension for complex requests which has been included in the draft.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/frontpage/27727|title=Cypriot lawmakers challenged to ensure FOI is free and exceptions are limited|last=|first=|date=March 1, 2017|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cyprus-mail.com/2017/02/18/ngo-calls-foi-fees-axed/|title=NGO calls for FOI fees to be axed|last=Andreou|first=Evie|date=February 18, 2017|website=cyprus-mail.com|publisher=Cyprus Mail Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to Access Info, also the regime of possible exceptions needs to be reviewed. Currently, the draft includes absolute exceptions, with no [[public interest]] test.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, under the international and European transparency standards, when disclosure of information is denied  requesters must be given clear reasons as to why the exception has been applied.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In March 2017, the recommendations elaborated by Access Info Europe were sent to the Cypriot Parliament Legal Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.access-info.org/wp-content/uploads/Comments_FOIlaw_cyprus_parliamentarycommittee_28feb2016.pdf|title=Σχόλια από Access Info Europe περί το νομοσχέδιο που ρυθμίζει το δικαίωμα πρόσβασης σε ληροφορίες του δημόσιου τομέα (Comments from Access Info Europe on the draft law regulating the right of access to Public Sector Information)|last=|first=|date=February 28, 2016|website=access-info.org|publisher=Access Info Europe|language=Greek|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since March 2015, [[Citizen Service Centres]] have been established all over the island in order to provide multiple services as an alternative channel for dealing with public agencies/organizations. They work through a single 4-digit number (1434) which citizens can call in order to obtain information with respect to approximately 90 services offered by the CSCs, such as eligibility criteria for submitting an application, documents that need to be submitted, fees charged etc. Through this Call Centre, citizens can also submit applications for 18 services relating to the issuing of specific documents/licenses/certificates etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2016/nrp2016_cyprus_en.pdf|title=EUROPE 2020- Cyprus National Reform Programme 2016|last=|first=|date=April 2016|website=ec.europa.eu|publisher=European Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An Antology of Chance Operations.jpg|thumb|right|Book cover.]]

'''''An Anthology of Chance Operations''''' (An Anthology) was an [[artist's book]] publication from the early 1960s of experimental [[neodada]] art and music composition that used [[John Cage]] inspired [[Aleatoric music|indeterminacy]]. It was edited by [[La Monte Young]] and [[DIY]] co-published in 1963 by Young and [[Jackson Mac Low]] in [[New York City]]. Its full title is: '''''An Anthology''''' of chance operations concept art anti-art indeterminacy improvisation meaningless work natural disasters plans of action stories diagrams Music poetry essays dance constructions mathematics compositions''. 

==Legacy==
The project became the manifestation of the original impetus for establishing [[Fluxus]].   

In autumn 1960 the editor of the magazine ''Beatitude'' magazine approached Young and Mac Low after a reading and asked them if they would guest-edit an issue of the East Coast edition of his magazine, ''Beatitude East''. Given free rein to include whoever and whatever he wanted, Young collected a large body of new and experimental music, [[anti art]], [[poetry]], essays and performance scores from America, Europe and Japan. The magazine, however, folded after only one issue, and the materials that Young had collected were never published until An Anthology of Chance Operations.

In June 1961 [[George Maciunas]], who had already begun plans to publish a magazine in the autumn of the same year, designed the book's layout and title pages, while others, including Mac Low, produced the typescript for the works themselves.

Although it can be argued&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon-noir.com/BOOKS/6_%20The_Fluxus_Reader_Ken_Friedman.pdf Fluxus Reader by [[Ken Friedman]]]&lt;/ref&gt; that An Anthology is not strictly a [[Fluxus]] publication, its development and production was a central event in the formation of Fluxus. It was the first collaborative publication project between people who were to become part of Fluxus: Young (editor and co-publisher), Mac Low (co-publisher) and Maciunas (designer).

The art dealer [[Heiner Friedrich]] issued a second edition in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ubu.com/historical/young/ An Anthology of Chance Operations]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''{{IAST|Anekāntavāda}}''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:अनेकान्तवाद|अनेकान्तवाद]]}}, "many-sidedness") refers to the [[Jainism|Jain]] doctrine about metaphysical truths that emerged in ancient [[India]].{{sfn|Cort|2000|p=325-326, 342}} It states that the ultimate truth and reality is complex and has multiple aspects.&lt;ref name="Dundas2002"&gt;{{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul | editor =Tara Sethia | title =Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ | year =2004 | location =Delhi | pages =123–136 | isbn =81-208-2036-3 | chapter =Beyond Anekāntavāda : A Jain approach to religious tolerance }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anekantavada has also been interpreted to mean non-absolutism, "intellectual Ahimsa",{{sfn|Cort|2000|p=324}} [[religious pluralism]],{{sfn|Wiley|2009|p=36}} as well as a rejection of fanaticism that leads to terror attacks and mass violence.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor=Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=85–88 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that modern revisionism has attempted to reinterpret anekantavada with religious tolerance, openmindedness and pluralism.&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt;{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=329-334}}

According to [[Jainism]], no single, specific statement can describe the nature of existence and the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute truth]]. This knowledge (''[[Kevala Jnana]]''), it adds, is comprehended only by the [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihants]]. Other beings and their statements about absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Jaini | first=Padmanabh | year=1998 | location=New Delhi |page=91 | isbn=81-208-1578-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; All knowledge claims, according to the ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine must be qualified in many ways, including being affirmed and denied.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"/&gt; Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.

The origins of ''anekāntavāda '' can be traced back to the teachings of [[Mahavira|Mahāvīra]] (599–527 [[BCE]]), the 24th Jain {{IAST|''[[Tirthankara|Tīrthankara]]''}}.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=2-3}} The [[dialectic]]al concepts of ''syādvāda'' "conditioned viewpoints" and ''nayavāda'' "partial viewpoints" arose from ''anekāntavāda'' in the medieval era, providing Jainism with more detailed logical structure and expression. The details of the doctrine emerged in Jainism in the 1st millennium CE, from debates between scholars of Jain, Buddhist and Hindu schools of philosophies.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-2}}

==Etymology==
The word ''anekāntavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words: ''anekānta'' and ''vāda''. The word ''anekānta'' itself is composed of three root words, "an" (not), "eka" (one) and "anta" (end, side), together it connotes "not one ended, sided", "many-sidedness", or "manifoldness".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}}&lt;ref name= "grimes34"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''vāda'' means "doctrine, way, speak, thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1899), "वाद", Sanskrit English Dictionary with Etymology, Oxford University Press, pages 939-940&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Philip C. Almond|title=Mystical Experience and Religious Doctrine: An Investigation of the Study of Mysticism in World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBSn4dR087YC |year=1982|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-90-279-3160-3|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''anekāntavāda'' is translated by scholars as the doctrine of "many-sidedness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas F. Gier|title=Spiritual Titanism: Indian, Chinese, and Western Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b0uIvu4aBuMC |year= 2000|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn= 978-0-7914-4528-0|pages=80, 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew R. Murphy|title=The Blackwell Companion to Religion and Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2O9JlrJ1wwAC |year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9131-9|pages=267–269}}&lt;/ref&gt; "non-onesidedness",{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=1}} or "many pointedness".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}}

The term ''anekāntavāda'' is not found in early texts considered canonical by Svetambara tradition of Jainism. However, traces of the doctrines are found in comments of Mahavira in these Svetambara texts, where he states that the finite and infinite depends on one's perspective. The word anekantavada was coined by Acharya Siddhasen Divakar to significant the teaching of Mahavira that truth can be expressed in infinite ways. The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'' by Acharya Umaswami, and is considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects. In the Digambara tradition texts. The 'two-truths theory' of Kundakunda also provides the core of this doctrine.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}}

==Philosophical overview==
The Jain doctrine of ''anekāntavāda'', also known as ''anekāntatva'', states that truth and reality is complex and always has multiple aspects. Reality can be experienced, but it is not possible to totally express it with language. Human attempts to communicate is ''naya'', or "partial expression of the truth".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229–231}} Language  is not Truth, but a means and attempt to express truth. From truth, according to Māhavira, language returns and not the other way around.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}&lt;ref name=iepmahav/&gt; One can experience the truth of a taste, but cannot fully express that taste through language. Any attempts to express the experience is ''syāt'', or valid "in some respect" but it still remains a "perhaps, just one perspective, incomplete".&lt;ref name=iepmahav&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/jain/ Jain philosophy], IEP, Mark Owen Webb, Texas Tech University&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, spiritual truths are complex, they have multiple aspects, language cannot express their plurality, yet through effort and appropriate karma they can be experienced.{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=75–79}}

The ''anekāntavāda'' premises of the Jains is ancient, as evidenced by its mention in Buddhist texts such as the ''Samaññaphala Sutta''. The Jain āgamas suggest that Māhavira's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a "qualified yes" (''syāt'').{{sfn|Matilal|1990|pp=301–305}}{{sfn|Balcerowicz|2015|pp=205–218}} These texts identify ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine to be one of the key differences between the teachings of the Māhavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer "it is" or "it is not" to metaphysical questions. The Māhavira, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both "it is" and "it is not", with "perhaps" qualification and with reconciliation to understand the absolute reality.{{sfn|Matilal|1998|pp=128–135}} ''Syādvāda'' (predication [[logic]]) and ''Nayavāda'' (perspective [[epistemology]]) of Jainism expand on the concept of ''anekāntavāda''. ''Syādvāda'' recommends the expression of ''anekānta'' by prefixing the epithet ''syād'' to every phrase or expression describing the nature of existence.{{sfn|Koller|2000|pp=400–407}}{{sfn|Sangave|2006|p=48-51}}

The Jain doctrine of ''anekāntavāda'', according to Bimal Matilal, states that "no philosophic or metaphysical proposition can be true if it is asserted without any condition or limitation".{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=2}} For a metaphysical proposition to be true, according to Jainism, it must include one or more conditions (''syadvada'') or limitations (''nayavada'', standpoints).{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=2-3, 30-32, 52-54}}

===Syādvāda===

''Syādvāda'' ({{lang-sa|स्याद्वाद}}) is the theory of ''conditioned predication'', the first part of which is derived from the Sanskrit word ''syāt'' ({{lang-sa|स्यात्}}), which is the third person singular of the optative tense of the Sanskrit verb ''as'' ({{lang-sa|अस्}}), 'to be', and which becomes ''syād'' when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, in accordance with ''sandhi''. The optative tense in Sanskrit (formerly known as the 'potential') has the same meaning as the present tense of the subjunctive mood in most Indo-European languages, including Hindi, Latin, Russian, French, etc.  It is used when there is uncertainty in a statement; not 'it is', but 'it may be', 'one might', etc.  The subjunctive is very commonly used in Hindi, for example, in 'kya kahun?', 'what to say?'.  The subjunctive is also commonly used in conditional constructions; for example, one of the few English locutions in the subjunctive which remains more or less current is 'were it ०, then ०', or, more commonly, 'if it were..', where 'were' is in the past tense of the subjunctive.

Syat can be translated into English as meaning "perchance, may be, perhaps" (it is).{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}  The use of the verb 'as' in the optative tense is found in the more ancient Vedic era literature in a similar sense.  For example, sutra 1.4.96 of [[Pāṇini|Panini]]'s Astadhyayi explains it as signifying "a chance, maybe, probable".{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}

In Jainism, however, ''syadvada'' and ''anekanta'' is not a theory of uncertainty, doubt or relative probabilities. Rather, it is "conditional yes or conditional approval" of any proposition, state Matilal and other scholars.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=81–83}} This usage has historic precedents in classical Sanskrit literature, and particularly in other ancient Indian religions (Buddhism and Hinduism) with the phrase ''syad etat'',  meaning "let it be so, but", or "an answer that is 'neither yes nor no', provisionally accepting an opponent's viewpoint for a certain premise".  This would be expressed in archaic English with the subjunctive: 'be it so', a direct translation of ''syad etat''.  Traditionally, this debate methodology was used by Indian scholars to acknowledge the opponent's viewpoint, but disarm and bound its applicability to certain context and persuade the opponent of aspects not considered.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=52-53}}&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor= Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=93–95 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charitrapragya, in Jain context ''syadvada'' does not mean a doctrine of doubt or skepticism, rather it means "multiplicity or multiple possibilities".{{sfn|Charitrapragya|2004|pp=81–83}} ''Syat'' in Jainism connotes something different from what the term means in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, it does not connote an answer that is "neither yes nor no", but it connotes a "many sidedness" to any proposition with a sevenfold predication.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;

''Syādvāda'' is a theory of qualified predication, states Koller. It states that all knowledge claims must be qualified in many ways, because reality is many-sided.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"&gt;{{cite book | title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | last=Koller | first=John | editor= Tara Sethia | chapter=Why is Anekāntavāda important? | year=2004 | location=Delhi | pages=90–92 | isbn=81-208-2036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is done so systematically in later Jain texts through ''saptibhaṅgīnāya'' or "[[Jaina seven-valued logic|the theory of sevenfold scheme]]".&lt;ref name="kollerjurno2"/&gt; These ''saptibhaṅgī'' seem to be have been first formulated in Jainism by the 5th or 6th century CE Svetambara scholar Mallavadin,{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=230}} and they are:&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "grimes"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 312&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=29}}
#Affirmation: ''syād-asti''—in some ways, it is,
#Denial: ''syān-nāsti''—in some ways, it is not,
#Joint but successive affirmation and denial: ''syād-asti-nāsti''—in some ways, it is, and it is not,

Each of these seven predicates state the Jain viewpoint of a multifaceted reality from the perspective of time, space, substance and mode.&lt;ref name="kollerjurno3"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grimes" /&gt; The phrase ''syāt'' declares the standpoint of expression – affirmation with regard to own substance (''[[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya]]''), place (''kṣetra''), time (''kāla''), and being (''bhāva''), and negation with regard to other substance (''dravya''), place (kṣetra), time (kāla), and being (''bhāva''). Thus, for a ‘jar’, in regard to substance (''dravya'') – earthen, it simply is; wooden, it simply is not. In regard to place (''kṣetra'') – room, it simply is; terrace, it simply is not.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=30}} In regard to time (''kāla'') – summer, it simply is; winter, it simply is not. In regard to being (''bhāva'') – brown, it simply is; white, it simply is not. And the word ‘simply’ has been inserted for the purpose of excluding a sense not approved by the ‘nuance’; for avoidance of a meaning not intended.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=30}}

According to [[Acharya Samantabhadra|Samantabhadra]]'s text ''Āptamīmāṁsā'' (Verse 105), "''Syādvāda'', the doctrine of conditional predications, and ''kevalajñāna'' (omniscience), are both illuminators of the substances of reality. The difference between the two is that while ''kevalajñāna'' illumines directly, ''syādvāda'' illumines indirectly".{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p= 163}} ''Syadvada'' is indispensable and helps establish the truth, according to Samantabhadra.{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p= 174}}

===Nayavāda===

''Nayavāda'' ({{lang-sa|नयवाद}}) is the theory of standpoints or viewpoints. ''Nayavāda'' is a compound of two [[Sanskrit]] words—''naya'' ("standpoint, viewpoint, interpretation") and ''vāda'' ("doctrine, thesis").&lt;ref name="Grimes202"&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 198, 202–03, 274, 301&lt;/ref&gt; Nayas are philosophical perspective about a particular topic, and how to make proper conclusions about that topic.{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}

According to Jainism, there are seven ''nayas'' or viewpoints through which one can make complete judgments about absolute reality using ''syadvada''.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=230-231}} These seven ''naya'', according to [[Umaswati]], are:{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}&lt;ref&gt;Grimes, John (1996) p. 119, 198–03, 274, 301&lt;/ref&gt;
#Naigama-naya: common sense or a universal view
#Samgraha-naya: generic or class view that classifies it
#Vyavahara-naya: pragmatic or a particular view assesses its utility
#Rijusutra-naya: linear view considers it in present time
#Sabda-naya: verbal view that names it
#Samabhirudha-naya: etymological view uses the name and establishes it nature
#Evambhuta-naya: actuality view considers its concrete particulars

The ''naya'' theory emerged after about the 5th century CE, and underwent extensive development in Jainism. There are many variants of ''nayavada'' concept in later Jain texts.{{sfn|Long|2009|p=125}}{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=230-231}}

A particular viewpoint is called a ''naya'' or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, ''Nayavada'' does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A ''naya'' reveals only a part of the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (''syādvāda'').{{sfn|Vijay K Jain|2016|p=28}}

===Jiva, the changing soul===
[[File:Mahavra 1900 art.jpg|thumb|Mahāvīra did not use the word ''anekāntavada'', but his teachings contain the seeds of the concept (painting from [[Rajasthan]], ca. 1900)]]
Ancient India, particularly the centuries in which the Mahavira and the Buddha lived, was a ground of intense intellectual debates, especially on the nature of reality and self or soul. Jain view of soul differs from those found in ancient Buddhist and Hindu texts, and Jain view about ''jiva'' and ''ajiva'' (self, matter) utilizes ''anekantavada''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Benesch|title=An Introduction to Comparative Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4cEWDAAAQBAJ |year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-230-59738-9|pages=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H.

The [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] thought (Hindu) postulated the impermanence of matter and body, but the existence of an unchanging, eternal metaphysical reality of ''[[Brahman]]'' and ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'' (soul, self). The Buddhist thought also postulated impermanence, but denied the existence of any unchanging, eternal soul or self and instead posited the concept of [[anatta]] (no-self).{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=87-88}}{{sfn|Wiley|2004|pp=2-5}}{{sfn|Long|2013|pp=122-125}} According to the vedāntin (Upanishadic) conceptual scheme, the Buddhists were wrong in denying permanence and absolutism, and within the Buddhist conceptual scheme, the vedāntins were wrong in denying the reality of impermanence. The two positions were contradictory and mutually exclusive from each other's point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Koller, John (2004) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The Jains managed a synthesis of the two uncompromising positions with ''anekāntavāda''.&lt;ref name="Ronald"&gt;{{cite web | last =Huntington | first =Ronald | title =Jainism and Ethics | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html | accessdate =2007-07-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archivedate= 19 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}; Quote: "To counter the proponents of these diametrically opposed positions [Buddhist and Hindu], Jains developed a position knows as syadvada [seeud-VAH-duh], the way or path of "perhaps, maybe or somehow." Syadvada states simply that judgments resting on different points of view may differ without any of them being wholly wrong. [...] A limited and incomplete judgment is called a naya [nuh-yuh], and all human knowledge is a compilation of nayas, judgments resulting from different attitudes. The Jains were thus able to accept equally the Hindu views of "being" and Buddhist views of "becoming," but took neither in the sense that their partisan advocates desired or found comforting. [...] The Jain doctrine of syadvada is non-absolutist and stands firmly against all dogmatisms, even including any assertion that Jainism is the right religious path."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arvind" &gt;[[Arvind Sharma|Sharma, Arvind]] (2001) Preface xii&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of a higher, inclusive level made possible by the [[ontology]] and [[epistemology]] of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'', Jains do not see such claims as contradictory or mutually exclusive; instead, they are seen as ''ekantika'' or only partially true.&lt;ref&gt;Sethia, Tara (2004) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain breadth of vision embraces the perspectives of both Vedānta which, according to Jainism, "recognizes substances but not process", and Buddhism, which "recognizes process but not substance". Jainism, on the other hand, pays equal attention to both substance (''dravya'') and process (''paryaya'').&lt;ref name="Burch"&gt;Burch, George (1964) pp. 68–93&lt;/ref&gt;

This philosophical syncretisation of paradox of change through ''anekānta'' has been acknowledged by modern scholars such as [[Arvind Sharma]], who wrote:&lt;ref name="Arvind"/&gt;
{{Quote|Our experience of the world presents a profound paradox which we can ignore existentially, but not philosophically. This paradox is the paradox of change. Something – A changes and therefore it cannot be permanent. On the other hand, if A is not permanent, then what changes? In this debate between the "permanence" and "change", Hinduism seems more inclined to grasp the first horn of the dilemma and Buddhism the second. It is Jainism that has the philosophical courage to grasp both horns fearlessly and simultaneously, and the philosophical skill not to be gored by either.}}

===Inclusivist or exclusivist===
Some Indian writers state that Anekantavada is an inclusivist doctrine positing that Jainism accepts "non-Jain teachings as partial versions of truth", a form of sectarian tolerance. Others scholars state this is incorrect and a reconstruction of Jain history because Jainism has consistently seen itself in "exclusivist term as the one true path".&lt;ref name=sethia123/&gt; Classical Jain scholars saw their premises and models of reality as superior than the competing spiritual traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism, both of which Jainism considered inadequate. For instance, the Jain text ''Uttaradhyayana Sutra'' in section 23.63 calls the competing Indian thought to be "heterodox and heretics" and that they "have chosen a wrong path, the right path is that taught by the [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jinas]]".&lt;ref name=sethia123&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas |editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=123–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the early Jain scholar Haribhadra, who likely lived between the 6th and 8th century, states that those who do not follow the teachings of Jainism cannot be "approved or accommodated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas |editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC|year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=125–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Koller states ''anekāntavāda'' to be "epistemological respect for view of others" about the nature of existence whether it is "inherently enduring or constantly changing", but "not relativism; it does not mean conceding that all arguments and all views are equal".&lt;ref name="koller89"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Koller|editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary times, according to Paul Dundas, the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine has been interpreted by some Jains as intending to "promote a universal religious tolerance", and a teaching of "plurality" and "benign attitude to other [ethical, religious] positions". This is problematic and a misreading of Jain historical texts and Mahavira's teachings, states Dundas.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The "many pointedness, multiple perspective" teachings of the Mahavira is a doctrine about the nature of [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Reality]] and human existence, and it is sometimes called "non-absolutism" doctrine.{{sfn|Sethia|2004|pp=86-91}} However, it is not a doctrine about tolerating or condoning activities such as sacrificing or killing animals for food, violence against disbelievers or any other living being as "perhaps right".{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=232–234}} The Five vows for Jain monks and nuns, for example, are strict requirements and there is no "perhaps, just one perspective".{{sfn|Long|2009|pp=98–106}} Similarly, since ancient times, Jainism co-existed with Buddhism and Hinduism, according to Dundas, but Jainism was highly critical of the knowledge systems and ideologies of its rivals, and vice versa.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=233}}

==History and development==
The principle of ''anekāntavāda'' is one of the foundational [[Jain philosophy|Jain philosophical]] concept. The development of ''anekāntavāda'' also encouraged the development of the dialectics of ''syādvāda'' (conditioned viewpoints) and ''nayavāda'' (partial viewpoints).

According to Karl Potter, the Jain ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine emerged in a milieu that included Buddhists and Hindus in ancient and medieval India.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt; The diverse Hindu schools such as Nyaya-Vaisheshika, Samkhya-Yoga and Mimamsa-Vedanta, all accepted the premise of [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] that "unchanging permanent soul, self exists and is self-evident", while various schools of early Buddhism denied it and substituted it with [[Anatta]] (no-self, no-soul). Further, for causation theories, Vedanta schools and Madhyamika Buddhists had similar ideas, while Nyaya-Vaisheshika and non-Madhyamika Buddhists generally agreed on the other side. Jainism, using its ''anekāntavāda'' doctrine occupied the center of this theological divide on soul-self (''jiva'') and causation theories, between the various schools of Buddhist and Hindu thought.&lt;ref name=johnson232/&gt;&lt;ref name=potter114&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter|title=Presuppositions of India's Philosophies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RPLGiHRb_FgC |year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0779-2|pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
The origins of ''anekāntavāda'' are traceable in the teachings of Mahāvīra, who used it effectively to show the relativity of truth and reality. Taking a relativistic viewpoint, Mahāvīra is said to have explained the nature of the soul as both permanent, from the point of view of underlying substance, and temporary, from the point of view of its modes and modification.&lt;ref name="bhagvati"&gt;Charitrapragya, Samani (2004) p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
Early Jain texts were not composed in Vedic or classical Sanskrit, but in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit language.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=60-62}} According to Matilal, the earliest Jain literature that present a developing form of a substantial ''anekantavada'' doctrine is found in Sanskrit texts, and after Jaina scholars had adopted Sanskrit to debate their ideas with Buddhists and Hindus of their era.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-3}} These texts show a synthetic development, the existence and borrowing of terminology, ideas and concepts from rival schools of Indian thought but with innovation and original thought that disagreed with their peers.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=1-3}}

The early Svetambara canons and teachings do not use the terms ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'', but contain teachings in rudimentary form without giving it proper structure or establishing it as a separate doctrine. ''Śvētāmbara'' text, ''[[Sutrakritanga]]'' contains references to ''Vibhagyavāda'', which, according to [[Hermann Jacobi]], is the same as ''syādvāda'' and ''saptibhaṅgī''.&lt;ref name="sutra"&gt;Jacobi, Hermann (1895) 14:21–22&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jacobi in his 1895 translation interpreted ''vibhagyavada'' as ''syadvada'', the former mentioned in the Svetambara Jain canonical text ''[[Sutrakritanga]]''.&lt;ref name="jacobi327"/&gt; However, the Digambara Jains dispute this text is canonical or even authentic.&lt;ref name=britcanonjaina&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Jaina-canon Jaina canon], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|

The earliest comprehensive teachings of anekāntavāda doctrine is found in the ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'' of Umasvati, considered to be authoritative by all Jain sects including Svetambara and Digambara.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}} The century in which Umaswati lived is unclear, but variously placed by contemporary scholars to sometime between 2nd and 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Slaje| title=Śāstrārambha: Inquiries Into the Preamble in Sanskrit|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fD0Ypvxmzj8C| year=2008| publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag| isbn=978-3-447-05645-8|page=35 with footnote 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=81}}&lt;ref name=dundaspo395&gt;{{harvnb|Dundas|2006|pp=395–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Digambara scholar [[Kundakunda]], in his mystical Jain texts, expounded on the doctrine of ''syādvāda'' and ''saptibhaṅgī'' in ''Pravacanasāra'' and  ''[[Pancastikayasara|Pancastikayasāra]]''.&lt;ref name= "Upadhyaye" /&gt;{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=229-231}} Kundakunda also used ''nayas'' to discuss the essence of the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] in ''[[Samayasara|Samayasāra]]''. Kundakunda is believed in the Digambara tradition to have lived about the 1st-century CE, but has been placed by early modern era scholars to 2nd or 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=280–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the earliest available secondary literature on Kundakunda appears in about the 10th century, which has led recent scholarship to suggest that he may have lived in or after 8th-century. This radical reassessment in Kundakunda chronology, if accurate, would place his comprehensive theories on ''anekantavada'' to the late 1st millennium CE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=107-109}}

===Parable of the blind men and elephant===
[[File:Medieval Jain temple Anekantavada doctrine artwork.jpg|thumb|Seven blind men and an elephant parable]]
The Jain texts explain the ''anekāntvāda'' concept using the parable of blind men and elephant, in a manner similar to those found in both Buddhist and Hindu texts about limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E.

{{Quote|A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, "elephant is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.}}

This parable is called ''Andha-gaja-nyaya'' maxim in Jain texts.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=40–43 with footnotes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the Jain references to this parable are found in ''Tattvarthaslokavatika'' of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the ''Syādvādamanjari'' of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century).&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt; According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of another aspect of that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt; Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.&lt;ref name="Balcerowicz2003p40"/&gt;

While the [[Blind men and an elephant|same parable]] is found in Buddhist and Hindu texts to emphasize the need to be watchful for partial viewpoints of a complex reality, the Jain text apply it to isolated topic and all subjects.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=John D.

===Medieval developments===

Ācārya [[Haribhadra]] (8th century CE) was one of the leading proponents of ''anekāntavāda''. He wrote a [[doxography]], a compendium of a variety of intellectual views. This attempted to contextualise Jain thoughts within the broad framework, rather than espouse narrow partisan views. It interacted with the many possible intellectual orientations available to Indian thinkers around the 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Ācārya Amrtacandra starts his famous 10th century CE work ''Purusathasiddhiupaya'' with strong praise for ''anekāntavāda'': "I bow down to the principle of ''anekānta'', the source and foundation of the highest scriptures, the dispeller of wrong one-sided notions, that which takes into account all aspects of truth, reconciling diverse and even contradictory traits of all objects or entity."&lt;ref&gt;Jain, J. P. (2006) Verse no. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Ācārya Vidyānandi (11th century CE) provides the analogy of the ocean to explain the nature of truth in ''Tattvarthaslokavārtikka'', 116:&lt;ref&gt;T. W. Rhys Davids (1980) pp. 576&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IAST|[[Yasovijaya|Yaśovijaya Gaṇi]]}}, a 17th-century Jain monk, went beyond ''anekāntavāda'' by advocating ''madhāyastha'', meaning "standing in the middle" or "equidistance". This position allowed him to praise qualities in others even though the people were non-Jain and belonged to other faiths.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; There was a period of stagnation after Yasovijayaji, as there were no new contributions to the development of Jain philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Jain, J. C. (2001) p. 1487&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The [[Jain philosophy|Jain philosophical]] concept of Anekantavada made important contributions to ancient [[Indian philosophy]], in the areas of skepticism and relativity.&lt;ref name = "McEvilley-p335"&gt;McEvilley, Thomas (2002) p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The epistemology of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'' also had a profound impact on the development of ancient Indian logic and philosophy.

While employing ''anekāntavāda'', the 17th century Jain scholar [[Yasovijaya]] stated that it is not ''anābhigrahika'' (indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2004) pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; In Jain belief, ''anekāntavāda'' transcends the various traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | last =Wright  | first =J.

===Role in Jain history===

''Anekāntavāda'' played a role in the history of Jainism in India, during intellectual debates from [[Saiva|Śaiva]]s, [[Vaishnava|Vaiṣṇavas]], [[Buddhist]]s, [[Muslim]]s, and [[Christian]]s at various times. According to John Koller, professor of [[Asian studies]], ''anekāntavāda'' allowed Jain thinkers to maintain the validity of their doctrine, while at the same time respectfully criticizing the views of their opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Koller|editor=Tara Sethia|title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases, it was a tool used by Jaina scholars to confront and dispute Buddhist scholars in ancient India, or in the case of [[Haribhadra]] justify the retaliation of the killing of his two nephews by Buddhist monks, with capital punishment for all Buddhist monks in the suspected monastery, according to the Buddhist version of Haribhadra's biography.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=335-336, 338-339}}

There is historical evidence that along with intolerance of non-Jains, Jains in their history have also been tolerant and generous just like Buddhists and Hindus.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} Their texts have never presented a theory for holy war.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} Jains and their temples have historically procured and preserved the classic manuscripts of Buddhism and Hinduism, a strong indicator of acceptance and plurality.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=336-337}} The combination of historic facts, states Cort, suggest that Jain history is a combination or tolerance and intolerance of non-Jain views, and that it is inappropriate to rewrite the Jainism past as a history of "benevolence and tolerance" towards others.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=340-341}}

===Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi===
Mahatma Gandhi mentioned Anekantavada and Syadvada in the journal ''[[Young India]] – 21 Jan 1926''. According to Jeffery D. Long – a scholar of Hindu and Jain studies, the Jain Syadvada doctrine helped Gandhi explain how he reconciled his commitment to the "reality of both the personal and impersonal aspects of [[Brahman]]", and his view of "Hindu religious pluralism":{{sfn|Long|2013|p=169}}&lt;ref name = "hay"&gt;{{cite book | last =Hay | first =Stephen N. | editor = Sibnarayan Ray | title =Gandhi India and the World | publisher =Nachiketa Publishers | year =1970 | location =Bombay | pages =14–23 | chapter =Jain Influences on Gandhi's Early Thought }}&lt;/ref&gt;

I have therefore no objection to calling it real and unreal, and thus being called an ''Anekāntavadi'' or a ''Syādvadi''. But my ''Syādvāda'' is not the ''Syādvāda'' of the learned, it is peculiarly my own. I cannot engage in a debate with them.

===Against religious intolerance and contemporary terrorism===
Referring to the [[September 11 attacks]], John Koller states that the threat to life from religious violence in modern society mainly exists due to faulty epistemology and metaphysics as well as faulty ethics. A failure to respect the life of other human beings and other life forms, states Koller, is "rooted in dogmatic but mistaken knowledge claims that fail to recognize other legitimate perspectives". Koller states that ''anekāntavāda'' is a Jain doctrine that each side commit to accepting truths of multiple perspectives, dialogue and negotiations.&lt;ref name="Johnkoller"&gt;Koller, John (2004) pp. 85–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroud|first=Scott R.|date=2014-07-03|title=Anekāntavāda and Engaged Rhetorical Pluralism: Explicating Jaina Views on Perspectivism, Violence, and Rhetoric | journal= Advances in the History of Rhetoric |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15362426.2014.933721 | volume=17|issue =2|pages=131–156|doi= 10.1080/15362426.2014.933721| issn= 1536-2426}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|James William Jones|2008}}

According to Sabine Scholz, the application of the ''Anekantavada'' as a religious basis for "intellectual Ahimsa" is a modern era reinterpretation, one attributed to the writings of A.B. Dhruva in 1933. This view states that ''Anekantavada'' is an expression of "religious tolerance of other opinions and harmony". In the 21st century, some writers have presented it as an intellectual weapon against "intolerance, fundamentalism and terrorism".&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabine Scholz|editor=Julia A. B. Hegewald and Subrata K. Mitra|title=Re-Use-The Art and Politics of Integration and Anxiety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ZqHAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA282 |year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-0981-5|pages=282–284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars such as [[John E. Cort]] and [[Paul Dundas]] state that, while Jainism indeed teaches non-violence as the highest ethical value, the reinterpretation of ''Anekantavada'' as "religious tolerance of other opinions" is a "misreading of the original doctrine". In Jain history, it was a metaphysical doctrine and a philosophical method to formulate its distinct ascetic practice of liberation. Jain history shows, to the contrary, that it persistently was harshly critical and intolerant of Buddhist and Hindu spiritual theories, beliefs and ideologies.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=324-347}}&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt; John Cort states that the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine in pre-20th century Jain literature had no relation to religious tolerance or "intellectual Ahimsa". Jain intellectual and social history toward non-Jains, according to Cort, has been contrary to the modern revisionist attempts, particularly by diaspora Jains, to present "Jains having exhibited a spirit of understanding and tolerance toward non-Jains", or that Jains were rare or unique in practicing religious tolerance in Indian intellectual history.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=329-331}} According to Padmanabha Jaini, states Cort, indiscriminate open mindedness and the approach of "accepting all religious paths as equally correct when in fact they are not" is an erroneous view in Jainism and not supported by the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=333-334}}

According to Paul Dundas, in and after the 12th century, the persecution and violence against Jains by Muslim state caused Jain scholars to revisit their theory of [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence). For example, Jinadatta Suri in 12th century, wrote during a time of widespread destruction of Jain temples and blocking of Jaina pilgrimage by Muslim armies, that "anybody engaged in a religious activity who was forced to fight and kill somebody" in self-defense would not lose any merit.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=162-163}} N.L. Jain, quoting Acarya Mahaprajna, states ''Anekantavada'' doctrine is not a principle that can be applied to all situations or fields. In his view, the doctrine has its limits and ''Anekantavada'' doctrine does not mean intellectual tolerance or acceptance of religious violence, terrorism, taking of hostages, proxy wars such as in Kashmir, and that "to initiate a conflict is as sinful as to tolerate or not oppose it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.L. Jain|editor=Colette Caillat and Nalini Balbir|title=Jaina Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecKCrO6nLiAC |year=2008|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3247-3|pages=82–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reinterpretation of ''Anekantavada'' as a doctrine of religious tolerance is novel, popular but not unusual for contemporary Jains. It is a pattern of reinterpretation and reinvention to rebrand and reposition that is found in many religions, states Scholz.&lt;ref name="Hegewald2012p282"/&gt;

==Comparison with non-Jain doctrines==
According to Bhagchandra Jain, one of the difference between the Buddhist and Jain views is that "Jainism accepts all statements to possess some relative (''anekāntika'') truth" while for Buddhism this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Bhagchandra Jain; ''The Rudiments Of Anekāntavāda In Early Pali Literature''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, states Jayatilleke, "no proposition could in theory be asserted to be categorically true or false, irrespective of the standpoint from which it was made, in Buddhism such categorical assertions were considered possible in the case of some propositions."&lt;ref name="Jayatilleke 1963, p 280"&gt;Jayatilleke; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge. Publisher: George Allen and Unwin, 1963, pp. 279-280.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Jainism, there are propositions that are categorically true in Buddhism, and there are others that are ''anekamsika'' (uncertain, indefinite). Examples of categorically true and certain doctrines are the [[Four Noble Truths]], while examples of the latter in Buddhism are the [[The unanswered questions|avyakata-theses]].&lt;ref name="Jayatilleke 1963, p 280"/&gt; Further, unlike Jainism, Buddhism does not have a Nayavāda doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke; Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge. Publisher: George Allen and Unwin, 1963, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karl Potter and other scholars, Hinduism developed various theory of relations such as ''satkaryavada'', ''asatkaryavada'', ''avirodhavada'' and others.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard King|title=Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism: The Mahayana Context of the Gaudapadiya-Karika|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l3ekXTZMZ_sC |publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-1-4384-0904-7|pages=194–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''anekantavada'' overlaps with two major theories found in Hindu and Buddhist thought, according to James Lochtefeld. The ''Anekantavada'' doctrine is ''satkaryavada'' in explaining causes, and the ''asatkaryavada'' in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects.&lt;ref name=potter114/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

==Criticism==
[[Indologists]] such as professor [[John E. Cort]] state that ''anekāntavāda'' is a doctrine that was historical used by Jain scholars not to accept other viewpoints, but to insist on the Jain viewpoint. Jain monks used ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādvāda'' as debating weapons to silence their critics and defend the Jain doctrine.{{sfn|Cort|2000|pp=324-347}} According to [[Paul Dundas]], in Jain hands, this method of analysis became "a fearsome weapon of philosophical [[polemic]] with which the doctrines of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] could be pared down to their ideological bases of simple permanence and impermanence, respectively, and thus could be shown to be one-pointed and inadequate as the overall interpretations of reality they purported to be".&lt;ref Name="Dundas192"&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain scholars, however, considered their own theory of ''Anekantavada'' self-evident, immune from criticism, needing neither limitations nor conditions.&lt;ref Name="Dundas192" /&gt;

The doctrines of ''anekāntavāda'' and ''syādavāda'' are often criticised to denying any certainty, or accepting incoherent contradictory doctrines. Another argument against it, posited by medieval era Buddhists and Hindus applied the principle on itself, that is if nothing is definitely true or false, is ''anekāntavāda'' true or false?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Webb | first =Mark Owen | title =The Jain Philosophy | work =The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url =http://www.iep.utm.edu/j/jain.htm#H4 | accessdate = 2008-03-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080302171025/http://www.iep.utm.edu/j/jain.htm| archivedate= 2 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pandya, V. (2001) p. 5210&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Karl Potter, the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine accepts the norm in Indian philosophies that all knowledge is contextual, that object and subject are interdependent. However, as a theory of relations, it does not solve the deficiencies in other progress philosophies, just "compounds the felony by merely duplicating the already troublesome notion of a dependence relation".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

===Hindu philosophies===
====Nyaya====
The [[Nyaya]] school criticized the Jain doctrine of ''anekantavada'', states Karl Potter, as "wanting to say one thing at one time, the other at another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; The Naiyayikas states that it makes no sense to simultaneously say, "jiva and ajiva are not related" and "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that ''jiva'' attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of ''anekantavada'' makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya texts.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl H. Potter|title=Presuppositions of India's Philosophies|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=RPLGiHRb_FgC |year= 1991|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn= 978-81-208-0779-2|pages=145–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vaisheshika====
The [[Vaisheshika]] and [[Shaivism]] school scholar Vyomashiva criticized the ''Anekantavada'' doctrine because, according to him, it makes all moral life and spiritual pursuits for [[moksha]] meaningless. Any spiritually liberated person must be considered under ''Anekantavada'' doctrine to be [a] both liberated and not liberated from one point of view, and [b] simply not liberated from another point of view, since all assertions are to be qualified and conditional under it. In other words, states Vyomashiva, this doctrine leads to a paradox and circularity.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

====Vedanta====
''Anekāntavāda'' was analyzed and critiqued by [[Adi Shankara|Adi Śankarācārya]] (~800 CE) in his ''bhasya'' on ''[[Brahmasutra]]'' (2:2:33–36):&lt;ref&gt;Nakamura, Hajime (1992) pp. 169–70&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that ''anekantavada'' doctrine when applied to philosophy suffers from two problems: ''virodha'' (contradictions) and ''samsaya'' (dubiety), neither of which it is able to reconcile with objectivity.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

{{Quote|
It is impossible that contradictory attributes such as being and non-being should at the same time belong to one and the same thing; just as observation teaches us that a thing cannot be hot and cold at the same moment. The third alternative expressed in the words — they either are such or not such — results in cognition of indefinite nature, which is no more a source of true knowledge than doubt is. Thus the means of knowledge, the object of knowledge, the knowing subject, and the act of knowledge become all alike indefinite. How can his followers act on a doctrine, the matter of which is altogether indeterminate? The result of your efforts is perfect knowledge and is not perfect knowledge. Observation shows that, only when a course of action is known to have a definite result, people set about it without hesitation. Hence a man who proclaims a doctrine of altogether indefinite contents does not deserve to be listened any more than a drunken or a mad man.
|Adi Shankara, ''Brahmasutra'', 2.2:33–36}}

Shankara's criticism of ''anekantavada'' extended beyond the arguments of it being incoherent epistemology in ontological matters. According to Shankara, the goal of philosophy is to identify one's doubts and remove them through reason and understanding, not get more confused.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; The problem with ''anekantavada'' doctrine is that it compounds and glorifies confusion. Further, states Shankara, Jains use this doctrine to be "certain that everything is uncertain". According to Karl Potter, Shankara does not take Jains seriously and admits that he doesn't understand Jainism's theory of relations.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

Contemporary scholars, states Piotr Balcerowicz, concur that the Jain doctrine of ''Anekantavada'' does reject some versions of the "law of non-contradiction", but it is incorrect to state that it rejects this law in all instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Piotr Balcerowicz|title=Essays in Jaina Philosophy and Religion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NcRpfZcIhLoC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=2003|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1977-1|pages=42–43 with footnotes 15 and 16}}, '''Quote:''' "This is the sense in which it is correct to say that the Jainas reject the "law of non-contradiction".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist philosophy===
The Buddhist scholar [[Shantarakshita|Śāntarakṣita]], and his student Kamalasila, criticized ''anekantavada'' by presenting his arguments that it leads to the Buddhist premise "jivas (souls) do not exist". That is, the two of the most important doctrines of Jainism are mutually contradictory premises.&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;{{sfn|Matilal|1981|p=57}} According to Santaraksita, Jains state that "jiva is one considered collectively, and many considered distributively", but if so debates Santaraksita, "jiva cannot change". He then proceeds to show that changing jiva necessarily means jiva appear and disappear every moment, which is equivalent to "jiva don't exist".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt; According to Karl Potter, the argument posited by Śāntarakṣita is flawed, because it commits what is called in the Western logic as the "fallacy of division".&lt;ref name="Potter1991p145"/&gt;

The Buddhist logician [[Dharmakirti]] critiqued ''anekāntavāda'' as follows:{{sfn|Pandya|2001}}
{{Quote|With the differentiation removed, all things have dual nature. Then, if somebody is implored to eat curd, then why he does not eat camel?" The insinuation is obvious; if curd exists from the nature of curd and does not exist from the nature of a camel, then one is justified in eating camel, as by eating camel, he is merely eating the negation of curd.|Dharmakirti, ''Pramānavarttikakārika''}}

===Self-criticism in Jain scholarship===
The medieval era Jain logicians [[Akalanka]] and [[Vidyananda (8th-century Jain monk)|Vidyananda]], who were likely contemporaries of Adi Shankara, acknowledged many issues with anekantavada in their texts. For example, Akalanka in his ''Pramanasamgraha'' acknowledges seven problems when ''anekantavada'' is applied to develop a comprehensive and consistent philosophy: dubiety, contradiction, lack of conformity of bases (''vaiyadhi karanya''), joint fault, infinite regress, intermixture and absence.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}} Vidyananda acknowledged six of those in the Akalanka list, adding the problem of ''vyatikara'' (cross breeding in ideas) and ''apratipatti'' (incomprehensibility). [[Prabhācandra]], who probably lived in the 11th-century, and several other later Jain scholars accepted many of these identified issues in ''anekantavada'' application.{{sfn|Matilal|1981|pp=57-58}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5069">[[File:Bollaert vu depuis le terril du 11-19.JPG|thumb|Nivel was assaulted in the vicinity of the [[Stade Félix Bollaert]] in Lens]]
On 21 June 1998, Daniel Nivel, member of the National Gendarmerie was assaulted in the city of [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] by German [[football hooligans]] during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. He fell into a six-week coma and was left with permanent disability.

One of his attackers was arrested at the scene and tried in France, receiving a jail sentence of five years and being barred from returning to the country. Four others were tried in [[Essen]] in their own country and found guilty, with one being jailed for ten years for attempted murder and the others receiving shorter sentences for serious bodily harm.

The attack was deemed a national shame by German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. In the years since, Nivel has been a guest of honour at Germany football matches and a foundation in his name has opposed football hooliganism.

==Attack==
After Germany's 2–2 draw with [[FR Yugoslavia national football team|FR Yugoslavia]] at the [[Stade Félix Bollaert]], 43-year-old Nivel was one of three members of the National Gendarmerie attacked by hooligans. He was struck by advertising boards and when he was lying on the floor without his helmet, was stamped and kicked in the head. Nivel fell into a [[coma]] until 4 August,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=World Cup Gendarme out of coma|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/144985.stm|accessdate=10 June 2016|date=5 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was left with permanent disability in his speech and movement.&lt;ref name=may01&gt;{{cite news|title=German fan jailed for gendarme attack|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1344821.stm|accessdate=10 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=22 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Helmut Kohl]] called the attack a national disgrace and requested that the team withdraw from the tournament.&lt;ref name=april99/&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Markus Warnecke, a [[Braunschweig]] native in his late 20s, was arrested at the scene of the crime. He was a bouncer and tattoo artist, and an alleged far-right activist. Warnecke was tried in nearby [[Saint-Omer]]; the prosecution considered him the ringleader, while the defence claimed that photographic element refuted that. Facing a maximum sentence of 15 years, Warnecke was jailed for five in May 2001. He was banned from all sports venues for five years and made ''[[persona non grata]]'' in France for ten.&lt;ref name=may01/&gt;

In April 1999, the trial began for four defendants in [[Essen]]. Andre Zawacki, Frank Renger and Tobias Reifschlaeger all confessed, while Christopher Rauch used his right to remain silent. Nivel did not attend the start of the trial due to his speech problems.&lt;ref name=april99&gt;{{cite news|title=Germans on trial for World Cup attack|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/332356.stm|accessdate=10 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=30 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, all four were found guilty: Zawacki was sentenced to ten years in prison for attempted murder; Reifschlaeger, Renger and Rauch were convicted of serious bodily harm. They were jailed for six, five, and three-and-a-half years respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Germans jailed for World Cup attack|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/511253.stm|accessdate=10 June 2016|publisher=BBC News|date=9 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 2000, the [[German Football Association]] (DFB) set up the Daniel Nivel Foundation to confront football hooliganism and support victims.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;

On 14 June 2006, Nivel was the DFB's guest of honour for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] game between that country and [[Poland national football team|Poland]] at the [[Westfalenstadion]] in [[Dortmund]]; he was seated next to Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]]. The game was also marred by hooliganism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelso|first1=Paul|title=Police arrest around 200 fans after city centre trouble|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/15/worldcup2006.sport26|accessdate=10 June 2016|work=The Guardian|date=15 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nivel was also invited to Germany's match against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] at [[UEFA Euro 2016]], in [[Lille]] near Lens.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite news|title=Germany invite victim of football hooliganism to Euro 2016 opener|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/germany/story/2888579/germany-invite-victim-of-football-hooliganism-to-euro-2016-opener|accessdate=10 June 2016|publisher=ESPN FC|date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 October 2018, prior to the [[UEFA Nations League]] football match between France and Germany, Nivel was awarded the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] by the german Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Heiko Maas]] in Paris.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5770">[[Image:Bispherical coordinates.png|thumb|right|350px|Illustration of bispherical coordinates, which are obtained by rotating a two-dimensional [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] about the axis joining its two foci.  The foci are located at distance 1 from the vertical ''z''-axis.  The red self-intersecting torus is the σ=45° isosurface, the blue sphere is the τ=0.5 isosurface, and the yellow half-plane is the φ=60° isosurface.  The green half-plane marks the ''x''-''z'' plane, from which φ is measured.  The black point is located at the intersection of the red, blue and yellow isosurfaces, at Cartesian coordinates roughly (0.841, -1.456, 1.239).]]

'''Bispherical coordinates''' are a three-dimensional [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]] [[coordinate system]] that results from rotating the two-dimensional [[bipolar coordinates|bipolar coordinate system]] about the axis that connects the two foci.  Thus, the two [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] &lt;math&gt;F_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; in [[bipolar coordinates]] remain points (on the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, the axis of rotation) in the bispherical coordinate system.

==Definition==
The most common definition of bispherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau, \phi)&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;
x = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} \cos \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
y = a \ \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} \sin \phi
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
z = a \ \frac{\sinh \tau}{\cosh \tau - \cos \sigma} 
&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; coordinate of a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; equals the angle &lt;math&gt;F_{1} P F_{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; coordinate equals the [[natural logarithm]] of the ratio of the distances &lt;math&gt;d_{1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d_{2}&lt;/math&gt; to the foci

:&lt;math&gt;
\tau = \ln \frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Coordinate surfaces===
Surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; correspond to intersecting tori of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
z^{2} +
\left( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - a \cot \sigma \right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{\sin^2 \sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

that all pass through the foci but are not concentric.  The surfaces of constant &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are non-intersecting spheres of different radii

:&lt;math&gt;
\left( x^2 + y^2 \right) +
\left( z - a \coth \tau \right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{\sinh^2 \tau}
&lt;/math&gt;

that surround the foci. The centers of the constant-&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; spheres lie along the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;-axis, whereas the constant-&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; tori are centered in the &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; plane.

===Inverse formulae===

The formulae for the inverse transformation are:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma = \arccos\left(\dfrac{R^2-a^2}{Q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau = \operatorname{arsinh}\left(\dfrac{2az}{Q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \operatorname{atan}\left(\dfrac{y}{x}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q=\sqrt{(R^2+a^2)^2-(2 a z)^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Scale factors===

The scale factors for the bispherical coordinates &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; are equal

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\sigma = h_\tau = \frac{a}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

whereas the azimuthal scale factor equals

:&lt;math&gt;
h_\phi = \frac{a \sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the infinitesimal volume element equals

:&lt;math&gt;
dV = \frac{a^3 \sin \sigma}{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^3} \, d\sigma \, d\tau \, d\phi
&lt;/math&gt;

and the Laplacian is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\nabla^2 \Phi =
\frac{\left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)^3}{a^2 \sin \sigma} 
&amp; \left[
\frac{\partial}{\partial \sigma}
\left( \frac{\sin \sigma}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \sigma}
\right) \right. \\[8pt]
&amp;{} \quad + \left.
\sin \sigma \frac{\partial}{\partial \tau}
\left( \frac{1}{\cosh \tau - \cos\sigma}
\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial \tau}
\right) + 
\frac{1}{\sin \sigma \left( \cosh \tau - \cos\sigma \right)}
\frac{\partial^2 \Phi}{\partial \phi^2}
\right]
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other differential operators such as &lt;math&gt;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla \times \mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in the coordinates &lt;math&gt;(\sigma, \tau)&lt;/math&gt; by substituting  the scale factors into the general formulae found in [[orthogonal coordinates]].

==Applications==
The classic applications of bispherical coordinates are in solving [[partial differential equations]], 
e.g., [[Laplace's equation]], for which bispherical coordinates allow a 
[[separation of variables]].  However, the [[Helmholtz equation]] is not separable in bispherical coordinates. A typical example would be the [[electric field]] surrounding two conducting spheres of different radii.

A '''blockchain''',{{R|te20151031|fortune20160515|nyt20160521}} originally '''block chain''',{{R|primer|obmh}} is a growing list of [[Record (computer science)|records]], called ''blocks'', which are linked using [[cryptography]].&lt;ref name="te20151031" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Narayanan|first1= Arvind|last2= Bonneau|first2= Joseph|last3= Felten|first3= Edward|last4= Miller|first4= Andrew|last5= Goldfeder|first5= Steven|title= Bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies: a comprehensive introduction|date= 2016|publisher= Princeton University Press|location= Princeton|isbn= 978-0-691-17169-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each block contains a [[Cryptographic hash function|cryptographic hash]] of the previous block,&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt; a [[Trusted timestamping|timestamp]], and transaction data (generally represented as a [[merkle tree]] root hash).

By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, [[distributed ledger]] that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way".&lt;ref name=hbr201701&gt;{{cite news |last= Iansiti |first= Marco |last2= Lakhani |first2= Karim R. |url= https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain |title= The Truth About Blockchain |work= [[Harvard Business Review]] |publisher= [[Harvard University]] |date= January 2017 |accessdate =2017-01-17 |quote =The technology at the heart of bitcoin and other virtual currencies, blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way. |deadurl= no |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20170118052537/https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain |archivedate= 18 January 2017 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For use as a distributed [[ledger]], a blockchain is typically managed by a [[peer-to-peer]] network collectively adhering to a [[Protocol (communication)|protocol]] for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered [[secure by design]] and exemplify a distributed computing system with high [[Byzantine fault tolerance]]. [[Decentralized]] consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.&lt;ref name="decapp"&gt;{{cite book |title =Decentralized Applications: Harnessing Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology |last =Raval |first=Siraj |year =2016 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |oclc =968277125 |isbn =978-1-4919-2452-5 |chapter =What Is a Decentralized Application? |chapter-url ={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =1|plainurl =yes}} |pages =[{{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =1|plainurl =yes}} 1]–[{{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|page =2|plainurl =yes}} 2] |url ={{google books|fvywDAAAQBAJ|plainurl =yes}} |accessdate =6 November 2016 |via =Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blockchain was invented by [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008 to serve as the public transaction [[ledger]] of the [[cryptocurrency]] [[bitcoin]].{{R|te20151031}} The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the [[double-spending]] problem without the need of a trusted authority or central [[Server (computing)|server]].

== History ==
[[File:Confirmed Transactions Per Day.png|thumb|220x220px|Bitcoin transactions (January 2009 – September 2017)]]
The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haber|first1=Stuart|last2=Stornetta|first2=W. Scott|title=How to time-stamp a digital document|journal=Journal of Cryptology|date=January 1991|volume=3|issue=2|pages=99–111|doi=10.1007/bf00196791|citeseerx=10.1.1.46.8740}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Bayer, Haber and Stornetta incorporated [[Merkle tree]]s to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.&lt;ref name="cryptocurrencytech" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bayer|first1=Dave|last2=Haber|first2=Stuart|last3=Stornetta|first3=W. Scott|title=Improving the Efficiency and Reliability of Digital Time-Stamping|journal=Sequences|date=March 1992|volume=2|pages=329–334|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-9323-8_24|isbn=978-1-4613-9325-2|citeseerx=10.1.1.71.4891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a [[Hashcash]]-like method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party.{{r|cryptocurrencytech}} The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency [[bitcoin]], where it serves as the public [[ledger]] for all transactions on the network.{{R|te20151031}}

In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20&amp;nbsp;GB ([[gigabyte]]s).&lt;ref name="hadi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Digital Currency: Bitcoin, Innovation, Financial Instruments, and Big Data |editor-last=Chuen |editor-first=David LEE Kuo |year=2015 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-802351-8 |chapter=A Light Touch of Regulation for Virtual Currencies |last1=Nian |first1=Lam Pak |last2=Chuen |first2=David LEE Kuo |page=319 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30&amp;nbsp;GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50&amp;nbsp;GB to 100&amp;nbsp;GB in size.

The words ''block'' and ''chain'' were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, ''blockchain,'' by 2016.  The term ''blockchain 2.0'' refers to new applications of the distributed blockchain database, first emerging in 2014.&lt;ref name="bc2.0"/&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' described one implementation of this second-generation programmable blockchain as coming with "a programming language that allows users to write more sophisticated smart contracts, thus creating invoices that pay themselves when a shipment arrives or share certificates which automatically send their owners dividends if profits reach a certain level."{{R|te20151031}}

{{asof|2016}}, blockchain 2.0 implementations continue to require an off-chain [[Oracle (computer science)|oracle]] to access any "external data or events based on time or market conditions [that need] to interact with the blockchain."&lt;ref name=bletchleyWP201609&gt;[https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md Project Bletchley Whitepaper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111135615/https://github.com/Azure/azure-blockchain-projects/blob/master/bletchley/bletchley-whitepaper.md |date=11 January 2017 }}, Microsoft, 2016-09-19.

According to [[Accenture]], an application of the [[diffusion of innovations]] theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the [[early adopter]]s phase.&lt;ref name="tfob"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts |title=The future of blockchain in 8 charts |accessdate=3 December 2016 |date=27 June 2016 |work=Raconteur |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202234125/http://raconteur.net/business/the-future-of-blockchain-in-8-charts |archivedate=2 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the [[Chamber of Digital Commerce]].

In May 2018, [[Gartner]] found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term ‘planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.artificiallawyer.com/2018/05/04/hype-killer-only-1-of-companies-are-using-blockchain-gartner-reports/|title=Hype Killer - Only 1% of Companies Are Using Blockchain, Gartner Reports {{!}} Artificial Lawyer|date=2018-05-04|work=Artificial Lawyer|access-date=2018-05-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

A blockchain is a [[Decentralized computing|decentralized]], [[Distributed computing|distributed]] and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved [[Storage_record|record]] cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.{{R|te20151031}}&lt;ref name="wired20161107"&gt;{{cite news |last=Armstrong |first=Stephen |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/unlock-the-blockchain |title=Move over Bitcoin, the blockchain is only just getting started |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=7 November 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108130946/http://www.wired.co.uk/article/unlock-the-blockchain |archivedate=8 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalini|first=Christian|last2=Gans|first2=Joshua S.|date=23 November 2016|title=Some Simple Economics of the Blockchain|ssrn=2874598|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2874598|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a [[peer-to-peer]] network and a distributed timestamping server. They are [[Authentication|authenticated]] by [[mass collaboration]] powered by [[collective]] [[self-interest]]s.&lt;ref name="hwb"&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=http://fortune.com/2016/05/08/why-blockchains-will-change-the-world/ |first1=Don |last1=Tapscott |authorlink1=Don Tapscott |first2=Alex |last2=Tapscott |authorlink2=Alex Tapscott |title=Here's Why Blockchains Will Change the World |accessdate=16 November 2016 |date=8 May 2016 |magazine=Fortune |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113134748/http://fortune.com/2016/05/08/why-blockchains-will-change-the-world/ |archivedate=13 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a design facilitates [[robustness (computer science)|robust]] [[workflow]] where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite [[Reproduction (economics)|reproducibility]] from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of [[double spending]]. A blockchain has been described as a ''value-exchange protocol''.&lt;ref name="bc2.0"&gt;{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |title=Block Chain 2.0: The Renaissance of Money |first=Kariappa |last=Bheemaiah |date=January 2015 |accessdate=13 November 2016 |magazine=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114001509/https://www.wired.com/insights/2015/01/block-chain-2-0/ |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This blockchain-based exchange of value can be completed quicker, safer and cheaper than with traditional systems.&lt;ref name="cbh"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.techinasia.com/talk/blockchain-cards-payments-industry |title=Can blockchain help the cards and payments industry? |first=Michele |last=Tucci |accessdate=16 November 2016 |date=29 November 2015 |website=Tech in Asia |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119120304/https://www.techinasia.com/talk/blockchain-cards-payments-industry |archivedate=19 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A blockchain can maintain [[title (property)|title rights]] because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels [[offer and acceptance]].

===Blocks===
Blocks hold batches of valid [[Transaction processing|transactions]] that are hashed and encoded into a [[Merkle tree]].&lt;ref name="te20151031"/&gt; Each block includes the [[cryptographic hash]] of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.&lt;ref name=te20151031 /&gt; This [[Iteration|iterative]] process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block.&lt;ref name="hadc"/&gt;

Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher value can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.&lt;ref name="hadc"/&gt; Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time.  They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks.  Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially&lt;ref name="bsm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |title=Bitcoin security model: trust by computation |first=Andreas |last=Antonopoulos |date=20 February 2014 |website=Radar |publisher=O'Reilly |accessdate=19 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031132328/http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |archivedate=31 October 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.{{R|te20151031}}{{r|t12|p=ch. 08}}{{r|paper}} For example, in a blockchain using the [[proof-of-work system]], the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is always considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of [[computation]]. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and [[Parallel computing|parallel]] manner.&lt;ref name="permbloc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://monax.io/explainers/permissioned_blockchains/ |title=Permissioned Blockchains |website=Explainer |publisher=Monax |accessdate=20 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120154948/https://monax.io/explainers/permissioned_blockchains/ |archivedate=20 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Block time====
The ''block time'' is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.quora.com/What-does-Block-Time-mean-in-cryptocurrency|title=What does "Block Time" mean in cryptocurrency?|author=Muhammad Ghayas|website=[[Quora]]|accessdate=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds.&lt;ref name="drd"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-dragonchain-interoperable-ledger/ |title=Disney Reveals Dragonchain, an Interoperable Ledger |first=Jamie |last=Redman |accessdate=4 December 2016 |date=25 October 2016 |website=Bitcoin.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102001523/https://news.bitcoin.com/disney-dragonchain-interoperable-ledger/ |archivedate=2 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for [[Ethereum]] is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is 10 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/why-is-ethereum-different-to-bitcoin/|title=Why is Ethereum different to Bitcoin?|author=Antonio Madeira|website=CryptoCompare|date=2018-01-12|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072118/https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/guides/why-is-ethereum-different-to-bitcoin/|archivedate=22 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hard forks ====
{{Transcluded section|Fork (blockchain)}}
{{trim|{{#section-h:Fork (blockchain)|Hard fork}}}}

=== Decentralization ===
By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.{{R|te20151031}} The decentralized blockchain may use [[ad-hoc]] [[message passing]] and [[distributed networking]].

Peer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that [[Security hacker|computer crackers]] can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of [[failure]]. Blockchain security methods include the use of [[public-key cryptography]].{{r|primer|p=5}} A ''public key'' (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A ''private key'' is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.{{R|te20151031}}

Every [[Node (networking)|node]] in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. [[Data quality]] is maintained by massive database [[Replication (computing)|replication]]&lt;ref name="decapp"/&gt; and [[computational trust]].

=== Openness ===
Open blockchains are more [[usability|user-friendly]] than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.{{R|t16|t10|t11|t8|t9}} Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term "blockchain" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC) in databases.{{R|t4}} Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.&lt;ref name="tapscott201605" /&gt;{{rp|30–31}} Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.{{R|t16|t11}} Nikolai Hampton of ''[[Computerworld]]'' said that "many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases," and "without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarTech"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barry |first1=Levine |title=A new report bursts the blockchain bubble |url=https://martechtoday.com/a-new-report-bursts-the-blockchain-bubble-216959 |accessdate=13 July 2018 |publisher=MarTech |date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Permissionless ====
The great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no [[access control]] is needed.&lt;ref name="bsm"/&gt; This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a [[transport layer]].&lt;ref name="bsm"/&gt;

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses [[Hashcash]] puzzles.  While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by [[Adam Back]], the original idea was first proposed by [[Cynthia Dwork]] and [[Moni Naor]] and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper "Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail".

Financial companies have not prioritised decentralized blockchains.&lt;ref name="trtb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/05/01/road-bitcoin-adoption-passes-many-stages/ |title=The Road To Bitcoin Adoption Passes Through Many Stages |first=J.P. |last=Buntinx |accessdate=4 December 2016 |date=1 May 2016 |website=News BTC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220062128/http://www.newsbtc.com/2016/05/01/road-bitcoin-adoption-passes-many-stages/ |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, [[venture capital]] investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.&lt;ref name="btt17"/&gt; Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. {{asof|2018|04}}, bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.

==== Permissioned (private) blockchain ====
{{main|Distributed ledger}}
Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.&lt;ref name="btit"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://au.pcmag.com/amazon-web-services/46389/feature/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-world |title=Blockchain: The Invisible Technology That's Changing the World |author=Bob Marvin |accessdate=25 September 2017 |date=30 August 2017 |newspaper=PC MAG Australia |publisher=ZiffDavis, LLC |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925180800/http://au.pcmag.com/amazon-web-services/46389/feature/blockchain-the-invisible-technology-thats-changing-the-world |archivedate=25 September 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to public blockchain networks, validators on private blockchain networks are vetted by the network owner.

The ''[[New York Times]]'' noted in both 2016 and 2017 that many corporations are using blockchain networks "with private blockchains, independent of the public system."&lt;ref name=nyt20160327/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/dealbook/ethereum-alliance-business-banking-security.html|title=Business Giants to Announce Creation of a Computing System Based on Ethereum|first=Nathaniel|last=Popper|date=27 February 2017|via=''The New York Times''|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620134100/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/business/dealbook/ethereum-alliance-business-banking-security.html|archivedate=20 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=this claim does not seem to make sense knowing that Ethereum blockchain is public, not private|date=September 2017}}

==== Disadvantages of private blockchain====
Nikolai Hampton pointed out in ''[[Computerworld]]'' that "There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt; This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a [[financial crisis]] or [[debt crisis]] like the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,&lt;ref name="SalsmanTheFinancial13"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardsalsman/2013/09/19/the-financial-crisis-was-a-failure-of-government-not-free-markets/ |title=The Financial Crisis Was A Failure Of Government, Not Free Markets |author=Salsman, R.M. |website=Forbes |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OKeeffeThePolitical15"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bruegel.org/2015/07/the-political-economy-of-financial-crisis-policy/ |title=The political economy of financial crisis policy |author=O'Keeffe, M.; Terzi, A. |website=Bruegel |date=7 July 2015 |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power—it's time consuming and expensive."&lt;ref name=cw20160905/&gt; He also said, "Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors.

== Uses ==
Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains today is as a [[distributed ledger]] for [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]], most notably [[bitcoin]]. There are a few operational products maturing from [[proof of concept]] by late 2016.&lt;ref name="btt17"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/blockchain-top-trends-in-2017 |title=Blockchain Top Trends In 2017 |first=James |last=Ovenden |publisher=The Innovation Enterprise |accessdate=4 December 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130143727/https://channels.theinnovationenterprise.com/articles/blockchain-top-trends-in-2017 |archivedate=30 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2016}}, some observers remain skeptical. Steve Wilson, of Constellation Research, believes the technology has been [[media circus|hyped]] with unrealistic claims.&lt;ref name="almeve"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/blockchain-almost-everything-you-read-wrong |title=Blockchain: Almost Everything You Read Is Wrong |first=Steve |last=Wilson |date=3 May 2016 |publisher=Constellation Research Inc. |accessdate=13 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114002256/https://www.constellationr.com/blog-news/blockchain-almost-everything-you-read-wrong |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; To mitigate [[risk management|risk]], businesses are reluctant to place blockchain at the core of the business structure.&lt;ref name="clsdips"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.ft.com/content/c905b6fc-4dd2-3170-9d2a-c79cdbb24f16 |title=CLS dips into blockchain to net new currencies |author=Katie Martin |accessdate=7 November 2016 |date=27 September 2016 |newspaper=Financial Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109152317/https://www.ft.com/content/c905b6fc-4dd2-3170-9d2a-c79cdbb24f16 |archivedate=9 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cryptocurrencies ===
{{main|Cryptocurrency}}
Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the [[bitcoin network]] and [[Ethereum]] network are blockchain-based. On May 8, 2018 [[Facebook]] confirmed that it is opening a new blockchain group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wagner |first1=Kurt |title=Facebook is making its biggest executive shuffle in company history |url=https://www.recode.net/2018/5/8/17330226/facebook-reorg-mark-zuckerberg-whatsapp-messenger-ceo-blockchain |website=Recode |accessdate=25 September 2018 |date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which will be headed by [[David A. Marcus|David Marcus]] who previously was in charge of [[Facebook Messenger|Messenger]]. According to [[The Verge]] Facebook is planning to launch its own [[cryptocurrency]] for facilitating payments on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gartenberg |first1=Chaim |title=Facebook reportedly plans to launch its own cryptocurrency |url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/11/17344318/facebook-cryptocurrency-token-blockchain-report-david-marcus |website=The Verge |accessdate=25 September 2018 |date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Smart contracts ===
{{main|Smart contract}}
Blockchain-based [[smart contract]]s are proposed contracts that could be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.&lt;ref name="unbi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Bitcoin: Cryptography, Engineering and Economics |last=Franco |first=Pedro |year=2014 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-1-119-01916-9 |page=9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YHfCBwAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=4 January 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214204859/https://books.google.com/books?id=YHfCBwAAQBAJ |archivedate=14 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main objectives of a smart contract is [[automation|automated]] [[escrow]]. An [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] staff discussion reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce [[moral hazard]]s and optimize the use of contracts in general. But "no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged." Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status is unclear.&lt;ref name="vcab"&gt;{{cite book | title = Virtual Currencies and Beyond: Initial Considerations | series = IMF Discussion Note | year = 2016 | publisher = International Monetary Fund | isbn = 978-1-5135-5297-2 | page = 23 | url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1603.pdf | accessdate = 2018-04-19 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180414210721/https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2016/sdn1603.pdf | archivedate = 2018-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryptokitties also demonstrated how blockchains can be used to catalog game assets ([[digital asset]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|title=CryptoKitties craze slows down transactions on Ethereum|date=2017-05-12|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112143517/http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|archivedate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the video game industry, while blockchain use is seen as part of a marketplace mechanism, such as with [[Robot Cache]], blockchain is also postulated as a way to share video game assets between various games. The Blockchain Game Alliance was formed in September 2018 to explore alternative uses of blockchains in video gaming with support of [[Ubisoft]] and [[Fig (company)|Fig]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/leading-blockchain-and-gaming-companies-form-blockchain-game-alliance/ | title=  Leading Blockchain and Gaming Companies Form Blockchain Game Alliance | first = Jimmy | last = Aki | date = September 27, 2018 | accessdate = October 21, 2018 | work = [[Bitcoin Magazine]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses ===

==Types of blockchains==
Currently, there are three types of blockchain networks - public blockchains, private blockchains and [[consortium]] blockchains.

===Public blockchains===
A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an [[internet]] connection can send [[Financial transaction|transactions]]{{disambiguation needed|date=March 2018}} to it as well as become a [[validator]] (i.e., participate in the execution of a [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus protocol]]).&lt;ref name=Perfectial&gt;{{cite web|title= How Companies Can Leverage Private Blockchains to Improve Efficiency and Streamline Business Processes|url=https://perfectial.com/blog/leveraging-private-blockchains-improve-efficiency-streamline-business-processes/|website=Perfectial}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sps|date=April 2018}} Usually, such networks offer [[Incentive|economic incentives]] for those who secure them and utilize some type of a [[Proof-of-stake|Proof of Stake]] or [[Proof-of-work system|Proof of Work]] algorithm.

Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are Bitcoin and Ethereum.

===Private blockchains===
A private blockchain is permissioned.&lt;ref name="btit"/&gt; One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted.

This type of blockchains can be considered a middle-ground for companies that are interested in the blockchain technology in general but are not comfortable with a level of control offered by public networks. Typically, they seek to [[Incorporation (business)|incorporate]] blockchain into their accounting and record-keeping procedures without sacrificing autonomy and running the risk of exposing sensitive data to the public internet.

===Consortium blockchains===
A consortium blockchain is often said to be semi-decentralized. It, too, is permissioned but instead of a single [[organization]] controlling it, a number of companies might each operate a [[Node (networking)|node]] on such a network. The administrators of a consortium chain restrict users' reading rights as they see fit and only allow a limited set of trusted nodes to execute a consensus protocol.

[[File:BlockchainPanelDiscussionAtIEEETechIgnite2017.jpg|thumb|Blockchain panel discussion at the first [[IEEE Computer Society]] TechIgnite conference]]

In October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catalini|first=Christian|last2=Tucker|first2=Catherine E.|date=11 August 2016|title=Seeding the S-Curve?

'''Crimes against humanity''' are certain acts that are deliberately committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack or individual attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population. The first prosecution for crimes against humanity took place at the [[Nuremberg trials]]. Crimes against humanity have since been prosecuted by other international courts (for example, the [[International Court of Justice]], the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]], and the [[International Criminal Court]]) as well as in domestic prosecutions. The law of crimes against humanity has primarily developed through the evolution of [[customary international law]]. Crimes against humanity are not codified in an international convention, although there is currently an international effort to establish such a treaty, led by the [[Crimes Against Humanity Initiative]].

Unlike [[war crime]]s, crimes against humanity can be committed during peace or war.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret M. DeGuzman,[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1745183 "Crimes Against Humanity"] RESEARCH HANDBOOK ON INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL LAW, Bartram S. Brown, ed., Edgar Elgar Publishing, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a [[de facto]] authority. [[War crime]]s, [[murder]], [[massacre]]s, [[dehumanization]], [[genocide]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[deportation]]s, [[unethical human experimentation]], [[extrajudicial punishment]]s including [[summary execution]]s, [[weapon of mass destruction|use of WMDs]], [[state terrorism]] or [[State-sponsored terrorism|state sponsoring of terrorism]], [[death squad]]s, [[kidnapping]]s and [[forced disappearance]]s, [[military use of children]], [[internment|unjust imprisonment]], [[slavery|enslavement]], [[cannibalism in humans|cannibalism]], [[torture]], [[rape]], [[political repression]], [[Institutional racism|racial discrimination]], [[religious persecution]], and other [[Human rights#Violations|human rights abuses]] may reach the threshold of crimes against humanity if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice.

==History of the term==

The term "crimes against humanity" is potentially [[ambiguous]] because of the ambiguity of the word "humanity", which can mean [[humankind]] (all human beings collectively) or [[humanity (virtue)|the value of humanness]]. The history of the term shows that the latter sense is intended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Luban |title=A Theory of Crimes Against Humanity |url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/facpub/146/ |journal=[[The Yale Journal of International Law]] |volume=29 |number=1 |date=2004 |pages=85–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abolition of the slave trade===
There were several bilateral treaties in 1814 that foreshadowed the multilateral treaty of [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna]] (1815) that used wording expressing condemnation of the [[slave trade]] using moral language. For example, the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]] between Britain and France included the wording "principles of natural justice"; and the British and United States plenipotentiaries stated in the [[Treaty of Ghent (1814)]] that the slave trade violated the "principles of humanity and justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Martin |first=Francisco Forrest |year=2007 |title=The Constitution as Treaty: The International Legal Constructionalist Approach to the U.S. Constitution |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139467186 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=xNEjqp2A6ZgC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 101]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multilateral ''Declaration of the Powers, on the Abolition of the Slave Trade, of 8 February 1815'' (Which also formed [[s:Final Act of the Congress of Vienna/Act XV|Section XV]] of the [[Final Act of the Congress of Vienna|Final Act]] of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of the same year) included in its first sentence the concept of the "principles of humanity and universal morality" as justification for ending a trade that was "odious in its continuance".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Plenipotentiaries of the treaty |title=The Parliamentary Debates from the Year 1803 to the Present Time |publisher= s.n. |year=1816|volume=32 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=I8ETAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=P74#PPT24,M1 p. 200]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First use===
{{See also|Armenian Genocide}}

The term "crimes against humanity" was used by [[George Washington Williams]] in a pamphlet published in 1890 to describe the practices of [[Leopold II of Belgium]]'s administration of the [[Congo Free State]].&lt;ref&gt;Hochschild, A. King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa. Houghton Mifflin, 1999. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; In treaty law, the term originated in the Second Hague Convention of 1899 preamble and was expanded in the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907 preamble and their respective regulations, which were concerned with the codification of new rules of [[international humanitarian law]]. The preamble of the two Conventions referenced the “laws of humanity” as an expression of underlying inarticulated humanistic values.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni, M. Crimes against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The term is part of what is known as the [[Martens Clause]].

On May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers, Britain, France, and Russia, jointly issued a statement explicitly charging for the first time ever another government of committing "a crime against humanity". An excerpt from this joint statement reads:

{{quote|In view of these new crimes of [[Ottoman Empire]] against humanity and civilization, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Governments]] announce publicly to the [[Sublime Porte]] that they will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members of the [[Young Turks|Ottoman Government]], as well as those of their agents who are implicated in such massacres.&lt;ref&gt;1915 declaration

&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the conclusion of the war, an international war crimes commission recommended the creation of a [[tribunal]] to try "violations of the laws of humanity". However, the US representative objected to references to "law of humanity" as being imprecise and insufficiently developed at that time and the concept was not pursued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cryer|first=Robert|title=An Introduction to International Criminal Law and Procedure|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=188|author2=Hakan Friman |author3=Darryl Robinson |author4=Elizabeth Wilmshurst }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuremberg trials===
{{Main article|Nuremberg trials}}
[[File:Defendants in the dock at the Nuremberg Trials.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Nuremberg Trials. Defendants in the dock. The main target of the prosecution was [[Hermann Göring]] (at the left edge on the  first row of benches), considered to be the most important surviving official in the [[Nazi Germany|Third ''Reich'']] after [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] death.]]

After the Second World War, the [[London Charter of the International Military Tribunal]] set down the laws and procedures by which the Nuremberg trials were to be conducted. The drafters of this document were faced with the problem of how to respond to [[the Holocaust]] and grave crimes committed by the [[Nazi regime]]. A traditional understanding of war crimes gave no provision for crimes committed by a power on its own citizens. Therefore, Article 6 of the Charter was drafted to include not only traditional war crimes and [[crime against peace|crimes against peace]], but also ''crimes against humanity'', defined as
{{quote|[[Murder]], extermination, [[Slavery|enslavement]], [[deportation]], and other [[wikt:inhumane|inhumane]] acts committed against any [[civilian]] population, before or during the war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nuremberg War Crimes Trial: The Charter Provisions|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judprov.asp |website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="black book"&gt;Nicolas Werth, Karel Bartošek, Jean-Louis Panné, Jean-Louis Margolin, Andrzej Paczkowski, [[Stéphane Courtois]], ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]: Crimes, Terror, Repression'', [[Harvard University Press]], 858 pages, {{ISBN|0-674-07608-7}}, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under this definition, crimes against humanity could only be punished insofar as they could be connected somehow to war crimes or crimes against peace.&lt;ref name=Hilberg1145/&gt; The jurisdictional limitation was explained by the American chief representative to the London Conference, [[Robert H. Jackson]], who pointed out that it "has been a general principle from time immemorial that the internal affairs of another government are not ordinarily our business". Thus, "it is justifiable that we interfere or attempt to bring retribution to individuals or to states only because the concentration camps and the deportations were in pursuance of a common plan or enterprise of making an unjust war".&lt;ref name=Hilberg1145&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hilberg|first1=Raul|title=The Destruction of the European Jews|date=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300095579|edition=3rd|pages=1145–1147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgement of the first Nuremberg trial found that "the policy of persecution, repression and murder of civilians" and persecution of Jews within Germany before the outbreak of war in 1939 were not crimes against humanity, because as "revolting and horrible as many of these crimes were, it has not been satisfactorily proved that they were done in execution of, or in connection with," war crimes or crimes against peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/judlawre.asp Judgement : The Law Relating to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity] contained in the [[Avalon Project]] archive at [[Yale Law School]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[subsequent Nuremberg trials]] were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 which included a revised definition of crimes against humanity with a wider scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wolfe |first1=Robert |title=Flaws in the Nuremberg Legacy: An Impediment to International War Crimes Tribunals' Prosecution of Crimes Against Humanity |journal=Holocaust and Genocide Studies |date=1 January 1998 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=443–444 |doi=10.1093/hgs/12.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tokyo Trial===
{{See also|International Military Tribunal for the Far East}}

[[File:IMTFE defendants.jpg|thumb|300px|The defendants at the Tokyo International Tribunal.  General [[Hideki Tojo]] was one of the main defendants, and is in the centre of the middle row.]]

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), also known as the Tokyo Trial, was convened to [[criminal procedure|try]] the leaders of the [[Empire of Japan]] for three types of crimes: "Class A" ([[crimes against peace]]), "Class B" ([[war crime]]s), and "Class C" (crimes against humanity), committed during the Second World War.

The legal basis for the trial was established by the [[Tokyo Charter|Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (CIMTFE)]] that was proclaimed on 19 January 1946. The tribunal convened on May 3, 1946, and was adjourned on November 12, 1948.

In the Tokyo Trial, Crimes against Humanity  (Class C) was not applied for any suspect.&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinobu Higurashi,Tokyo Saiban(Tokyo Trial),Kodansya-Gendai-Shinsho,Kodansha Limited,2008,p.26,pp.116-119.Hirohumi Hayashi,BC kyu Senpan Saiban,Iwanami Shoten Publishers,2005,p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=April 2016}}  Prosecutions related to the [[Nanking Massacre]] were categorised as infringements upon the [[Laws of War]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinobu Higurashi,op.cit.,pp.116-119.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Additional citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A panel of eleven [[judge]]s presided over the IMTFE, one each from victorious Allied powers ([[United States]], [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], [[Soviet Union]], [[United Kingdom]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Canada]], [[British India]], and the [[Philippines]]).

==Types of crimes against humanity==
The different types of crimes which may constitute crimes against humanity differs between definitions both internationally and on the domestic level. Isolated inhumane acts of a certain nature committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack may instead constitute grave infringements of [[human rights]], or –&amp;nbsp;depending on the circumstances&amp;nbsp;– [[war crimes]], but are not classified as crimes against humanity.&lt;ref name="Horton"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive - A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", Page 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apartheid===
{{Main article|Crime of apartheid}}

The systematic persecution of one racial group by another, such as occurred during the [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] government, was recognized as a crime against humanity by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/un/uncrime.htm International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011235327/http://www.anc.org.za/un/uncrime.htm |date=October 11, 2009 }} dopted and opened for signature, ratification by General Assembly resolution 3068 (XXVIII) of 30 November 1973. Entry into force 18 July 1976, in accordance with article X (10)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Charter of the United Nations]] (Article 13, 14, 15) makes actions of the General Assembly advisory to the Security Council.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html "Charter of the United Nations"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417093634/http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/index.html |date=April 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to apartheid in particular, the UN General Assembly has not made any findings, nor have apartheid-related trials for crimes against humanity been conducted.

===Rape and sexual violence===
Neither the Nuremberg or Tokyo Charters contained an explicit provision recognizing sexual and gender-based crimes as war crimes or crimes against humanity, although Control Council Law No. 10 recognized rape as a crime against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia  and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda both included rape as a crime against humanity. The ICC is the first international instrument expressly to include various forms of sexual and gender-based crimes{{snd}} including rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation, and other forms of sexual violence{{snd}} as both an underlying act of crimes against humanity and war crime committed in international and/or non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/otp/OTP-Policy-Paper-on-Sexual-and-Gender-Based-Crimes--June-2014.pdf "ICC Prosecutor's Policy Paper on Sexual and Gender-Based Crimes"] June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, the events of [[Khojaly Massacre|Khojaly]] and [[Khatyn massacre|Khatyn]] can be shown that the world strongly condemns. International institutions have asked for a ransom to avoid such incidents. There are hundreds of massacres, thousands of prisoners and wounded in these incidents.

In 2008, the [[U.N. Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|resolution 1820]], which noted that "rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide".&lt;ref name="Un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/sc9364.doc.htm |title=SECURITY COUNCIL DEMANDS IMMEDIATE AND COMPLETE HALT TO ACTS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST CIVILIANS IN CONFLICT ZONES, UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTING RESOLUTION 1820 (2008) |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2013-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Crimes Against Humanity Initiative]] was launched by Professor [[Leila Nadya Sadat]] at the [[Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute]] to address this gap in international law. The Initiative represents the first concerted effort to address the gap that exists in international criminal law by enumerating a comprehensive international convention on crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Gareth, [http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/speeches/2009/crimes-against-humanity-and-the-responsibility-to-protect.aspx "Crimes Against Humanity and the Responsibility to Protect"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105053758/http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/publication-type/speeches/2009/crimes-against-humanity-and-the-responsibility-to-protect.aspx |date=January 5, 2015 }} International Crisis Group&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2013, the United Nations [[International Law Commission]] voted to include the topic of crimes against humanity in its long-term program of work. In July 2014, the Commission moved this topic to its active programme of work&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Marcela Bailliet, [http://ilg2.org/2014/08/06/un-international-law-commission-to-elaborate-new-global-convention-on-crimes-against-humanity/ "UN International Law Commission to Elaborate New Global Convention on Crimes Against Humanity"] IntLawGrrls&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William A.

International Law Commission, Sixty-fifth session. p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  Professor Sean D. Murphy, the United States’ Member on the United Nations’ International Law Commission, has been named the Special Rapporteur for Crimes Against Humanity. Sean D. Murphy attended the 2008 Experts' Meeting held by the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative prior to this appointment.

There is some debate on what the status of crimes against humanity under customary international law is. M. Cherif Bassiouni argues that crimes against humanity are part of ''jus cogens'' and as such constitute a non-derogable rule of international law.&lt;ref name="Crimes Against Humanity"/&gt;

==United Nations==
The United Nations has been primarily responsible for the prosecution of crimes against humanity since it was chartered in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;https://undocs.org/A/RES/260(III)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Nuremberg, there was no international court with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity for almost 50 years. Work continued on developing the definition of crimes against humanity at the United Nations, however. In 1947, the [[International Law Commission]] was charged by the United Nations General Assembly with the formulation of the principles of international law recognized and reinforced in the Nuremberg Charter and judgment, and with drafting a ‘code of offenses against the peace and security of mankind’. Completed fifty years later in 1996, the Draft Code defined crimes against humanity as various inhumane acts, i.e., "murder, extermination, torture, enslavement, persecution on political, racial, religious or ethnic grounds, institutionalized discrimination, arbitrary deportation or forcible transfer of population, arbitrary imprisonment, rape, enforced prostitution and other inhuman acts committed in a systematic manner or on a large scale and instigated or directed by a Government or by any organization or group." This definition differs from the one used in Nuremberg, where the criminal acts were to have been committed “before or during the war”, thus establishing a nexus between crimes against humanity and armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internationalcrimesdatabase.org/Crimes/CrimesAgainstHumanity#_ftnref1 |title=ICD - Crimes against humanity |publisher=Asser Institute |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on the 2008–09 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] by [[Richard Goldstone]] accused Palestinian and Israeli forces of possibly committing a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8257301.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN condemns 'war crimes' in Gaza | date=16 September 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Goldstone said that he no longer believed that Israeli forces had targeted civilians or committed a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstone|first=Richard|title=Reconsidering the Goldstone Report on Israel and War Crimes|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/reconsidering-the-goldstone-report-on-israel-and-war-crimes/2011/04/01/AFg111JC_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|accessdate=2 August 2012|date=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March 2013, at its 22nd session, the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] established the [[Report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea|Commission of Inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea]] (DPRK). The Commission is mandated to investigate the systematic, widespread and grave violations of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with a view to ensuring full accountability, in particular for violations which may amount to crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/128/65/PDF/G1312865.pdf?OpenElement "Resolution A/HRC/RES/22/13: Situation of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829031840/http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G13/128/65/PDF/G1312865.pdf?OpenElement |date=August 29, 2013 }} Human Rights Council&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission dealt with matters relating to crimes against humanity on the basis of definitions set out by customary international criminal law and in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"&gt;Report of the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea - A/HRC/25/63, available at: {{cite web |url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/Documents.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425025103/http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/HRC/CoIDPRK/Pages/Documents.aspx |archivedate=2015-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Report by the commission found "the body of testimony and other information it received establishes that crimes against humanity have been committed in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, pursuant to policies established at the highest level of the State... These crimes against humanity entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation. The commission further finds that crimes against humanity are ongoing in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea because the policies, institutions and patterns of impunity that lie at their heart remain in place." Additionally, the commission found that crimes against humanity have been committed against starving populations, particularly during the 1990s, and are being committed against persons from other countries who were systematically abducted or denied repatriation, in order to gain labour and other skills for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.&lt;ref name="ohchr.org"/&gt;

===Security Council===
[[UN Security Council Resolution 1674]], adopted by the [[United Nations Security Council]] on 28 April 2006, "reaffirms the provisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 [[World Summit Outcome Document]] regarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef!OpenDocument Resolution 1674 (2006)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223154915/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAl.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/e529762befa456f8852571610045ebef%21OpenDocument |date=February 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|resolution]] commits the Council to action to protect civilians in armed conflict.

In 2008 the [[U.N. Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|resolution 1820]], which noted that “rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide”.&lt;ref name="Un.org"/&gt;

==International courts and criminal tribunals==
After the Nuremberg and Tokyo trials of 1945-1946, the next international tribunal with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity was not established for another five decades. In response to atrocities committed in the 1990s, multiple ad hoc tribunals were established with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Court, the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugolavia and for Rwanda each contain different definitions of crimes against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, Peter, [http://www.icclr.law.ubc.ca/Site%20Map/ICC/AspectofCrimesAgainstHumanity.pdf "Aspect of Crimes Against Humanity and the International Criminal Court"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021031709/http://www.icclr.law.ubc.ca/site%20map/icc/aspectofcrimesagainsthumanity.pdf |date=2012-10-21 }} International Centre for Criminal Law Reform and Criminal Justice Policy. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia===
{{Main article|International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia}}

In 1993, the UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), with jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute three international crimes which had taken place in the former Yugoslavia: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Article 5 of the ICTY Statute states that {{quotation|The International Tribunal shall have the power to prosecute persons responsible for the following crimes when committed in armed conflict, whether international or internal in character, and directed against any civilian population:&lt;ref name="ICTY Statute"&gt;[http://www.icty.org/x/file/Legal%20Library/Statute/statute_sept09_en.pdf "ICTY Statute"] Article 5&lt;/ref&gt;

:(a) murder;
:(b) extermination;
:(c) enslavement;
:(d) deportation;
:(e) imprisonment;
:(f) torture;
:(g) rape;
:(h) persecutions on political, racial and religious grounds;
:(i) other inhumane acts."}}

This definition of crimes against humanity revived the original ‘Nuremberg’ nexus with armed conflict, connecting crimes against humanity to both international and non-international armed conflict. It also expanded the list of criminal acts used in Nuremberg to include imprisonment, torture and rape.&lt;ref name="ICTY Statute"/&gt; Cherif Bassiouni has argued that this definition was necessary as the conflict in the former Yugoslavia was considered to be a conflict of both an international and non-international nature. Therefore, this adjusted definition of crimes against humanity was necessary to afford the tribunal jurisdiction over this crime.&lt;ref&gt;Cherif Bassiouni, M. Crimes against Humanity: Historical Evolution and Contemporary Application. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda===
{{Main article|International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda}}

The UN Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 1994 following the [[Rwandan Genocide]]. Under the ICTR Statute, the link between crimes against humanity and an armed conflict of any kind was dropped. Rather, the requirement was added that the inhumane acts must be part of a “systematic or widespread attack against any civilian population on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icls.de/dokumente/ictr_statute.pdf "ICTR Statute"] Article 3&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, the conflict in Rwanda was deemed to be non-international, so crimes against humanity would likely not have been applicable if the nexus to armed conflict had been maintained.

[[File:International Criminal Court Headquarters, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|right|278px|Headquarters of the ICC in The Hague]]

In 2002, the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC) was established in [[The Hague]] (Netherlands) and the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]] provides for the ICC to have jurisdiction over [[genocide]], crimes against humanity and war crimes. The definition of what is a "crime against humanity" for ICC proceedings has significantly broadened from its original legal definition or that used by the UN.&lt;ref name="crimesofwar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/crimes-against-humanity.html |title=Crimes Against Humanity |accessdate=2006-07-23 |author=Cherif Bassiouni |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718113035/http://www.crimesofwar.org/thebook/crimes-against-humanity.html |archivedate=2006-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the Rome Statute employs the same definition of crimes against humanity that the ICTR Statute does, minus the requirement that the attack was carried out ‘on national, political, ethnic, racial or religious grounds’. In addition, the Rome Statute definition offers the most expansive list of specific criminal acts that may constitute crimes against humanity to date.

Article 7 of the treaty stated that:

{{quotation|For the purpose of this Statute, "crime against humanity" means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/icc/statute/part-a.htm#2 Rome statute of the International Criminal Court] Article 7: Crimes against humanity.

:(a) [[Homicide|Murder]];
:(b) Extermination;
:(c) [[Slavery|Enslavement]];
:(d) [[Population transfer|Deportation or forcible transfer of population]];
:(e) [[Imprisonment]] or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law;
:(f) [[Torture]];
:(g) [[War rape|Rape]], [[sexual slavery]], [[forced prostitution|enforced prostitution]], [[forced pregnancy]], [[compulsory sterilization|enforced sterilization]], or any other form of [[sexual violence]] of comparable gravity;
:(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, [[Human race|racial]], national, ethnic, [[Culture|cultural]], [[Religion|religious]], [[gender]] as defined in paragraph 3, or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court;
:(i) [[Forced disappearance|Enforced disappearance]] of persons;
:(j) The [[crime of apartheid]];
:(k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health;}}

The [[Rome Statute]] Explanatory Memorandum states that crimes against humanity
{{quotation|are particularly odious offenses in that they constitute a serious attack on human dignity or grave humiliation or a degradation of one or more human beings. They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority. However, murder, extermination, torture, rape, political, racial, or religious persecution and other inhumane acts reach the threshold of crimes against humanity only if they are part of a widespread or systematic practice. Isolated inhumane acts of this nature may constitute grave infringements of human rights, or depending on the circumstances, war crimes, but may fall short of meriting the stigma attaching to the category of crimes under discussion. On the other hand, an individual may be guilty of crimes against humanity even if he perpetrates one or two of the offences mentioned above, or engages in one such offense against only a few civilians, provided those offenses are part of a consistent pattern of misbehavior by a number of persons linked to that offender (for example, because they engage in armed action on the same side or because they are parties to a common plan or for any similar reason.) Consequently when one or more individuals are not accused of planning or carrying out a policy of inhumanity, but simply of perpetrating specific atrocities or vicious acts, in order to determine whether the necessary threshold is met one should use the following test: one ought to look at these atrocities or acts in their context and verify whether they may be regarded as part of an overall policy or a consistent pattern of an inhumanity, or whether they instead constitute isolated or sporadic acts of cruelty and wickedness.&lt;ref name="Horton2"&gt;As quoted by Guy Horton in ''[http://www.ibiblio.org/obl/docs3/Horton-2005.pdf Dying Alive - A Legal Assessment of Human Rights Violations in Burma]'' April 2005, co-Funded by The Netherlands Ministry for Development Co-Operation. See section "12.52 Crimes against humanity", p. 201. He references RSICC/C, Vol. 1 p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To fall under the Rome Statute, a crime against humanity which is defined in Article 7.1 must be "part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population". Article 7.2.a states "For the purpose of paragraph 1: "Attack directed against any civilian population means a course of conduct involving the multiple commission of acts referred to in paragraph 1 against any civilian population, pursuant to or in furtherance of a State or organizational policy to commit such attack." This means that an individual crime on its own, or even a number of such crimes, would not fall under the Rome Statute unless they were the result of a State policy or an organizational policy. This was confirmed by [[Luis Moreno Ocampo]] in an open letter publishing his conclusions about allegations of crimes committed during the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 which might fall under the [[International Criminal Court|ICC]]. In a section entitled "Allegations concerning Genocide and Crimes against Humanity" he states that "the available information provided no reasonable indicator of the required elements for a crime against humanity," i.e. 'a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Luis Moreno Ocampo]]{{cite web|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf |title=OTP letter to senders re Iraq |accessdate=2006-02-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225075607/http://www.icc-cpi.int/library/organs/otp/OTP_letter_to_senders_re_Iraq_9_February_2006.pdf |archivedate=2006-02-25 |df= }}  9 February 2006.

The ICC can only prosecute crimes against humanity in situations under which it has jurisdiction. The ICC only has jurisdiction over crimes contained in its statute - genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity - which have been committed on the territory of a State party to the Rome Statute, when a non-party State refers a situation within its country to the court or when the United Nation Security Council refers a case to the ICC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/About+the+Court/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412060448/http://www.icc-cpi.int/Menus/ICC/About%2Bthe%2BCourt/ |archivedate=2011-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 the UN referred to the ICC the situation in Darfur.

==Council of Europe==
The [[Committee of Ministers]] of the [[Council of Europe]] on 30 April 2002 issued a recommendation to the member states, on the protection of women against violence. In the section "Additional measures concerning violence in conflict and post-conflict situations", states in paragraph 69 that member states should: "penalize rape, sexual slavery, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity as an intolerable violation of human rights, as crimes against humanity and, when committed in the context of an armed conflict, as war crimes;"&lt;ref&gt;[[Committee of Ministers]] of the [[Council of Europe]]: [http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec(2002)05.asp Recommendation (2002) 5]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127063047/http://www.coe.int/t/e/human_rights/equality/05._violence_against_women/002_Rec%282002%2905.asp |date=November 27, 2006 }} Paragraph 69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Explanatory Memorandum on this recommendation when considering paragraph 69:

The UN pointed out the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) specifically Article 7 (Crimes against Humanity which defines large-scale acts of violence against a locality’s civilian populace. These acts consist of murder; annihilation; enslavement; bondage; forced removal of the population; imprisonment or deprivation of physical liberty that violates international laws; maltreatment; forced prostitution and rape; discrimination and tyranny against certain groups; apartheid (racial discrimination and segregation); and, other inhumane acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/icc/statute/99_corr/cstatute.htm|title=Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 1998|last=Pronto|first=Arnold N.|website=legal.un.org|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A publication from Trial International mentioned that crimes against humanity have been collated starting in 1990.

In [[geometry]], '''curvilinear coordinates''' are a [[coordinate system]] for [[Euclidean space]] in which the [[coordinate line]]s may be curved. Commonly used curvilinear coordinate systems include: rectangular, spherical, and cylindrical coordinate systems.  These coordinates may be derived from a set of [[Cartesian coordinate]]s by using a transformation that is [[invertible|locally invertible]] (a one-to-one map) at each point. This means that one can convert a point given in a Cartesian coordinate system to its curvilinear coordinates and back. The name ''curvilinear coordinates'', coined by the French mathematician [[Gabriel Lamé|Lamé]], derives from the fact that the [[coordinate surfaces]] of the curvilinear systems are curved.

Well-known examples of curvilinear coordinate systems in three-dimensional Euclidean space ('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]], [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical]] and [[spherical coordinates|spherical polar]] coordinates. A Cartesian coordinate surface in this space is a [[coordinate plane]]; for example ''z'' = 0 defines the ''x''-''y'' plane. In the same space, the coordinate surface ''r'' = 1 in spherical polar coordinates is the surface of a unit [[sphere]], which is curved. The formalism of curvilinear coordinates provides a unified and general description of the standard coordinate systems.

Curvilinear coordinates are often used to define the location or distribution of physical quantities which may be, for example, [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s, [[vector (geometric)|vector]]s, or [[tensor]]s. Mathematical expressions involving these quantities in [[vector calculus]] and [[tensor analysis]] (such as the [[gradient]], [[divergence]], [[curl (mathematics)|curl]], and [[Laplacian]]) can be transformed from one coordinate system to another, according to transformation rules for scalars, vectors, and tensors. Such expressions then become valid for any curvilinear coordinate system.

Depending on the application, a curvilinear coordinate system may be simpler to use than the Cartesian coordinate system. For instance, a physical problem with [[Circular symmetry|spherical symmetry]] defined in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (for example, motion of particles under the influence of [[central force]]s) is usually easier to solve in [[spherical coordinates|spherical polar coordinates]] than in Cartesian coordinates. Equations with [[boundary conditions]] that follow coordinate surfaces for a particular curvilinear coordinate system may be easier to solve in that system. One would for instance describe the motion of a particle in a rectangular box in Cartesian coordinates, whereas one would prefer spherical coordinates for a particle in a sphere. Spherical coordinates are one of the most used curvilinear coordinate systems in such fields as [[Earth sciences]], [[cartography]], and [[physics]] (in particular [[quantum mechanics]], [[Theory of relativity|relativity]]), and [[engineering]].

==Orthogonal curvilinear coordinates in 3 Dimensions==

=== Coordinates, basis, and vectors ===
[[File:General curvilinear coordinates 1.svg|thumb|right|350px|Fig. 1 - Coordinate surfaces, coordinate lines, and coordinate axes of general curvilinear coordinates.]]
[[File:Spherical coordinate elements.svg|thumb|right|350px|Fig. 2 - Coordinate surfaces, coordinate lines, and coordinate axes of spherical coordinates. '''Surfaces:''' ''r'' - spheres, θ - cones, φ - half-planes; '''Lines:''' ''r'' - straight beams, θ - vertical semicircles, φ - horizontal circles;

'''Axes:''' ''r'' - straight beams, θ - tangents to vertical semicircles, φ - tangents to horizontal circles]]

For now, consider [[three-dimensional space|3d space]]. A point ''P'' in 3d space (or its [[position vector]] '''r''') can be defined using Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') [equivalently written (''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)], by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} = x \mathbf{e}_x + y\mathbf{e}_y + z\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;, where '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; are the ''[[standard basis|standard]] [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] vectors''.

It can also be defined by its '''curvilinear coordinates''' (''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) if this triplet of numbers defines a single point in an unambiguous way. The relation between the coordinates is then given by the invertible transformation functions:

:&lt;math&gt; x = f^1(q^1, q^2, q^3),\, y = f^2(q^1, q^2, q^3),\, z = f^3(q^1, q^2, q^3)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; q^1 = g^1(x,y,z),\, q^2 = g^2(x,y,z),\, q^3 = g^3(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;

The surfaces ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = constant, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = constant, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = constant are called the '''coordinate surfaces'''; and the space curves formed by their intersection in pairs are called the '''[[coordinate curves]]'''. The '''coordinate axes''' are determined by the [[tangent]]s to the coordinate curves at the intersection of three surfaces. They are not in general fixed directions in space, which happens to be the case for simple Cartesian coordinates, and thus there is generally no natural global basis for curvilinear coordinates.

In the Cartesian system, the standard basis vectors can be derived from the derivative of the location of point ''P'' with respect to the local coordinate

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_x = \dfrac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial x}; \;
\mathbf{e}_y = \dfrac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial y}; \;
\mathbf{e}_z = \dfrac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the same derivatives to the curvilinear system locally at point ''P'' defines the natural basis vectors:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{h}_1 = \dfrac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial q_1}; \;
\mathbf{h}_2 = \dfrac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial q_2}; \;
\mathbf{h}_3 = \dfrac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial q_3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Such a basis, whose vectors change their direction and/or magnitude from point to point is called a '''local basis'''. All bases associated with curvilinear coordinates are necessarily local. Basis vectors that are the same at all points are '''global bases''', and can be associated only with linear or [[affine coordinate system]]s.

Note: for this article '''e''' is reserved for the [[standard basis]] (Cartesian) and '''h''' or '''b''' is for the curvilinear basis.

These may not have unit length, and may also not be orthogonal.  In the case that they ''are'' orthogonal at all points where the derivatives are well-defined, we define the [[#Relation to Lamé coefficients|Lamé coefficients]] (after [[Gabriel Lamé]]) by

:&lt;math&gt;h_1 = |\mathbf{h}_1|; \; h_2 = |\mathbf{h}_2|; \; h_3 = |\mathbf{h}_3|&lt;/math&gt;

and the curvilinear orthonormal basis vectors by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_1 = \dfrac{\mathbf{h}_1}{h_1}; \;
\mathbf{b}_2 = \dfrac{\mathbf{h}_2}{h_2}; \;
\mathbf{b}_3 = \dfrac{\mathbf{h}_3}{h_3}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note that these basis vectors may well depend upon the position of ''P''; it is therefore necessary that they are not assumed to be constant over a region.  (They technically form a basis for the [[tangent bundle]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt; at ''P'', and so are local to ''P''.)

In general, curvilinear coordinates allow the natural basis vectors '''h'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; not all mutually perpendicular to each other, and not required to be of unit length: they can be of arbitrary magnitude and direction. The use of an orthogonal basis makes vector manipulations simpler than for non-orthogonal. However, some areas of [[physics]] and [[engineering]], particularly [[fluid mechanics]] and [[continuum mechanics]], require non-orthogonal bases to describe deformations and fluid transport to account for complicated directional dependences of physical quantities.  A discussion of the general case appears later on this page.

==Vector calculus==

===Differential elements===


In orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, since the [[total differential]] change in '''r''' is

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r}=\dfrac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial q^1}dq^1 + \dfrac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial q^2}dq^2 + \dfrac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial q^3}dq^3 = h_1 dq^1 \mathbf{b}_1 + h_2 dq^2 \mathbf{b}_2 + h_3 dq^3 \mathbf{b}_3 &lt;/math&gt;

so scale factors are &lt;math&gt;h_i = \left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial q^i}\right|&lt;/math&gt;

In non-orthogonal coordinates the length of  &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r}= dq^1 \mathbf{h}_1 + dq^2 \mathbf{h}_2 + dq^3 \mathbf{h}_3 &lt;/math&gt; is the positive square root of &lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{r} \cdot d\mathbf{r} = dq^i dq^j \mathbf{h}_i \cdot \mathbf{h}_j &lt;/math&gt; (with Einstein summation convention). The six independent scalar products ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;''='''h'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.'''h'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; of the natural basis vectors generalize the three scale factors defined above for orthogonal coordinates. The nine ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the components of the [[metric tensor]], which has only three non zero components in orthogonal coordinates: ''g&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;''=''h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;''=''h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''g&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;''=''h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Covariant and contravariant bases==

{{Main|Covariance and contravariance of vectors|Raising and lowering indices}}

[[File:Vector 1-form.svg|400px|thumb| A vector '''v''' ('''&lt;span style="color:#CC0000;"&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;''') represented by

• a vector basis ('''&lt;span style="color:orange;"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;, left:''' '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), tangent vectors to coordinate curves ('''black''') and

• a covector basis or cobasis ('''&lt;span style="color:blue;"&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt;, right:''' '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), normal vectors to coordinate surfaces ('''&lt;span style="color:#3B444B;"&gt;grey&lt;/span&gt;''')

 in ''general'' (not necessarily [[orthogonal coordinates|orthogonal]]) curvilinear coordinates (''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Note the basis and cobasis do not coincide unless the coordinate system is orthogonal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gravitation|author1=J.A. Wheeler |author2=C. Misner |author3=K.S. Thorne |publisher=W.H. Freeman &amp; Co|year=1973|isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Spatial gradients, distances, time derivatives and scale factors are interrelated within a coordinate system by two groups of basis vectors:

{{ordered list
|1 = basis vectors that are locally tangent to their associated coordinate pathline:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_i=\dfrac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial q^i}&lt;/math&gt;

which transforms like [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant vectors]] (denoted by lowered indices), or

|2 = basis vectors that are locally normal to the isosurface created by the other coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}^i=\nabla q^i &lt;/math&gt;

which transforms like [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant vectors]] (denoted by raised indices), ∇ is the [[del]] [[linear operator|operator]].
}}

Consequently, a general curvilinear coordinate system has two sets of basis vectors for every point: {'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} is the covariant basis, and {'''b'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;} is the contravariant (a.k.a. reciprocal) basis. The covariant and contravariant basis vectors types have identical direction for orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems, but as usual have inverted units with respect to each other.

Note the following important equality:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}^j = \delta^i_j &lt;/math&gt;
wherein &lt;math&gt; \delta^i_j &lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Kronecker delta#Generalizations of the Kronecker delta|generalized Kronecker delta]].

:{| class="toccolours collapsible collapsed" width="80%" style="text-align:left"
!Proof

In the Cartesian coordinate system &lt;math&gt; ( \mathbf{e}_x ,  \mathbf{e}_y, \mathbf{e}_z ) &lt;/math&gt;, we can write the dot product as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}^j = ( \dfrac {\partial x} {\partial q_i} , \dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_i} , \dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_i} ) \cdot ( \dfrac {\partial q_j} {\partial x} , \dfrac {\partial q_j} {\partial y} , \dfrac {\partial q_j} {\partial z} ) = \dfrac {\partial x} {\partial q_i} \dfrac {\partial q_j} {\partial x} + \dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_i} \dfrac {\partial q_j} {\partial y} + \dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_i} \dfrac {\partial q_j} {\partial z} &lt;/math&gt;

Let us consider an infinitesimal displacement &lt;math&gt; d \mathbf{r} = dx \cdot \mathbf{e}_x + dy \cdot \mathbf{e}_y + dz \cdot \mathbf{e}_z &lt;/math&gt; . Let dq&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, dq&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and dq&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; denote the corresponding infinitesimal changes in curvilinear coordinates q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.

By the chain rule, dq&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt; dq_1 = \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial x} dx + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial y} dy + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial z} dz
= \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial x} dx + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial y} (\dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_1} dq_1 + \dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_2} dq_2 + \dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_3} dq_3) + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial z} (\dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_1} dq_1 + \dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_2} dq_2 + \dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_3} dq_3) &lt;/math&gt;

If the displacement d'''r''' is such that dq&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = dq&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, i.e. the position vector '''r'''  moves by an infinitesimal amount along the coordinate axis q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=const and q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=const, then:
:&lt;math&gt; dq_1 = \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial x} dx + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial y} \dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_1} dq_1 + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial z} \dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_1} dq_1 &lt;/math&gt;
Dividing by dq&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and taking the limit dq&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → 0:
:&lt;math&gt;  1 =  \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial x} \dfrac {\partial x} {\partial q_1}   + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial y} \dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_1} + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial z} \dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_1} = \dfrac {\partial x} {\partial q_1} \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial x} + \dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_1} \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial y} + \dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_1} \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial z} &lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}_1\cdot\mathbf{b}^1 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Now if the displacement d'''r''' is such that dq&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=dq&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=0, i.e. the position vector '''r'''  moves by an infinitesimal amount along the coordinate axis q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=const and q&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;=const, then:
:&lt;math&gt; 0 = \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial x} dx + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial y} \dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_2} dq_2 + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial z} \dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_2} dq_2 &lt;/math&gt;
Dividing by dq&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and taking the limit dq&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 0:
:&lt;math&gt; 0 = \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial x} \dfrac {\partial x} {\partial q_2}  + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial y} \dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_2} + \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial z} \dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_2}  = \dfrac {\partial x} {\partial q_2} \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial x} + \dfrac {\partial y} {\partial q_2} \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial y}  + \dfrac {\partial z} {\partial q_2} \dfrac {\partial q_1} {\partial z}  &lt;/math&gt; 
or equivalently:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{b}_2\cdot\mathbf{b}^1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

And so forth for the other dot products.

A vector '''v''' can be specified in terms either basis, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = v^1\mathbf{b}_1 + v^2\mathbf{b}_2 + v^3\mathbf{b}_3 = v_1\mathbf{b}^1 + v_2\mathbf{b}^2 + v_3\mathbf{b}^3 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the Einstein summation convention, the basis vectors relate to the components by&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt;{{rp|pages=30–32}}
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = v^k\mathbf{b}_k\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = v^k\delta^i_k = v^i &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = v_k\mathbf{b}^k\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = v_k\delta_i^k = v_i &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = v^k\mathbf{b}_k\cdot\mathbf{b}_i = g_{ki}v^k &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = v_k\mathbf{b}^k\cdot\mathbf{b}^i = g^{ki}v_k &lt;/math&gt;
where ''g'' is the metric tensor (see below).

A vector can be specified with covariant coordinates (lowered indices, written ''v&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') or contravariant coordinates (raised indices, written ''v&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;''). From the above vector sums, it can be seen that contravariant coordinates are associated with covariant basis vectors, and covariant coordinates are associated with contravariant basis vectors.

A key feature of the representation of vectors and tensors in terms of indexed components and basis vectors is ''invariance'' in the sense that vector components which transform in a covariant manner (or contravariant manner) are paired with basis vectors that transform in a contravariant manner (or covariant manner).

===Constructing a covariant basis in one dimension===

[[File:Local basis transformation.svg|thumb|right|350px|Fig. 3 – Transformation of local covariant basis in the case of general curvilinear coordinates]]

Consider the one-dimensional curve shown in Fig. 3.  At point ''P'', taken as an [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]], ''x'' is one of the Cartesian coordinates, and ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is one of the curvilinear coordinates. The local (non-unit) basis vector is '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; (notated '''h'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; above, with '''b''' reserved for unit vectors) and it is built on the ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; axis which is a tangent to that coordinate line at the point ''P''. The axis ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and thus the vector '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; form an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with the Cartesian ''x'' axis and the Cartesian basis vector '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

It can be seen from triangle ''PAB'' that
:&lt;math&gt; \cos \alpha = \cfrac{|\mathbf{e}_1|}{|\mathbf{b}_1|} \quad \Rightarrow \quad |\mathbf{e}_1| = |\mathbf{b}_1|\cos \alpha&lt;/math&gt;
where |'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|, |'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| are the magnitudes of the two basis vectors, i.e., the scalar intercepts ''PB'' and ''PA''.  Note that ''PA'' is also the projection of '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the ''x'' axis.

However, this method for basis vector transformations using ''directional cosines'' is inapplicable to curvilinear coordinates for the following reasons:
#By increasing the distance from ''P'', the angle between the curved line ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and Cartesian axis ''x'' increasingly deviates from &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.
#At the distance ''PB'' the true angle is that which the tangent '''at point C''' forms with the ''x'' axis and the latter angle is clearly different from &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

The angles that the ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; line and that axis form with the ''x'' axis become closer in value the closer one moves towards point ''P'' and become exactly equal at ''P''.

Let point ''E'' be located very close to ''P'', so close that the distance ''PE'' is infinitesimally small. Then ''PE'' measured on the ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; axis almost coincides with ''PE'' measured on the ''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; line. At the same time, the ratio ''PD/PE'' (''PD'' being the projection of ''PE'' on the ''x'' axis) becomes almost exactly equal to &lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

Let the infinitesimally small intercepts ''PD'' and ''PE'' be labelled, respectively, as ''dx'' and d''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \alpha = \cfrac{dx}{dq^1} = \frac{|\mathbf{e}_1|}{|\mathbf{b}_1|}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the directional cosines can be substituted in transformations with the more exact ratios between infinitesimally small coordinate intercepts.  It follows that the component (projection) of '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the ''x'' axis is

:&lt;math&gt;p^1 = \mathbf{b}_1\cdot\cfrac{\mathbf{e}_1}{|\mathbf{e}_1|} = |\mathbf{b}_1|\cfrac{|\mathbf{e}_1|}{|\mathbf{e}_1|}\cos\alpha = |\mathbf{b}_1|\cfrac{dx}{dq^1} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cfrac{p^1}{|\mathbf{b}_1|} = \cfrac{dx}{dq^1}&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''q&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' = ''q&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''q''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) are [[Smooth function|smooth]] (continuously differentiable) functions the transformation ratios can be written as &lt;math&gt;\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial x_j}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\cfrac{\partial x_i}{\partial q^j}&lt;/math&gt;. That is, those ratios are [[partial derivative]]s of coordinates belonging to one system with respect to coordinates belonging to the other system.

===Constructing a covariant basis in three dimensions===


Doing the same for the coordinates in the other 2 dimensions, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be expressed as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{b}_1 = p^1\mathbf{e}_1 + p^2\mathbf{e}_2 + p^3\mathbf{e}_3 = \cfrac{\partial x_1}{\partial q^1} \mathbf{e}_1 + \cfrac{\partial x_2}{\partial q^1} \mathbf{e}_2 + \cfrac{\partial x_3}{\partial q^1} \mathbf{e}_3
&lt;/math&gt;
Similar equations hold for '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; so that the standard basis {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} is transformed to a local (ordered and '''''normalised''''') basis {'''b'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;} by the following system of equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   \mathbf{b}_1 &amp; = \cfrac{\partial x_1}{\partial q^1} \mathbf{e}_1 + \cfrac{\partial x_2}{\partial q^1} \mathbf{e}_2 + \cfrac{\partial x_3}{\partial q^1} \mathbf{e}_3 \\
   \mathbf{b}_2 &amp; = \cfrac{\partial x_1}{\partial q^2} \mathbf{e}_1 + \cfrac{\partial x_2}{\partial q^2} \mathbf{e}_2 + \cfrac{\partial x_3}{\partial q^2} \mathbf{e}_3 \\
   \mathbf{b}_3 &amp; = \cfrac{\partial x_1}{\partial q^3} \mathbf{e}_1 + \cfrac{\partial x_2}{\partial q^3} \mathbf{e}_2 + \cfrac{\partial x_3}{\partial q^3} \mathbf{e}_3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

By analogous reasoning, one can obtain the inverse transformation from local basis to standard basis:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
   \mathbf{e}_1 &amp; = \cfrac{\partial q^1}{\partial x_1} \mathbf{b}_1 + \cfrac{\partial q^2}{\partial x_1} \mathbf{b}_2 + \cfrac{\partial q^3}{\partial x_1} \mathbf{b}_3 \\
   \mathbf{e}_2 &amp; = \cfrac{\partial q^1}{\partial x_2} \mathbf{b}_1 + \cfrac{\partial q^2}{\partial x_2} \mathbf{b}_2 + \cfrac{\partial q^3}{\partial x_2} \mathbf{b}_3 \\
   \mathbf{e}_3 &amp; = \cfrac{\partial q^1}{\partial x_3} \mathbf{b}_1 + \cfrac{\partial q^2}{\partial x_3} \mathbf{b}_2 + \cfrac{\partial q^3}{\partial x_3} \mathbf{b}_3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Jacobian of the transformation===


The above [[systems of linear equations]] can be written in matrix form using the Einstein summation convention as
:&lt;math&gt;\cfrac{\partial x_i}{\partial q^k} \mathbf{e}_i = \mathbf{b}_k, \quad \cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial x_k} \mathbf{b}_i = \mathbf{e}_k&lt;/math&gt;.

This [[coefficient matrix]] of the linear system is the [[Jacobian matrix]] (and its inverse) of the transformation. These are the equations that can be used to transform a Cartesian basis into a curvilinear basis, and vice versa.

In three dimensions, the expanded forms of these matrices are
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{J} = \begin{bmatrix}
       \cfrac{\partial x_1}{\partial q^1} &amp; \cfrac{\partial x_1}{\partial q^2} &amp; \cfrac{\partial x_1}{\partial q^3} \\
       \cfrac{\partial x_2}{\partial q^1} &amp; \cfrac{\partial x_2}{\partial q^2} &amp; \cfrac{\partial x_2}{\partial q^3} \\
       \cfrac{\partial x_3}{\partial q^1} &amp; \cfrac{\partial x_3}{\partial q^2} &amp; \cfrac{\partial x_3}{\partial q^3} \\
     \end{bmatrix},\quad
\mathbf{J}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
       \cfrac{\partial q^1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \cfrac{\partial q^1}{\partial x_2} &amp; \cfrac{\partial q^1}{\partial x_3} \\
       \cfrac{\partial q^2}{\partial x_1} &amp; \cfrac{\partial q^2}{\partial x_2} &amp; \cfrac{\partial q^2}{\partial x_3} \\
       \cfrac{\partial q^3}{\partial x_1} &amp; \cfrac{\partial q^3}{\partial x_2} &amp; \cfrac{\partial q^3}{\partial x_3} \\
     \end{bmatrix}
 &lt;/math&gt;

In the inverse transformation (second equation system), the unknowns are the curvilinear basis vectors. For any specific location there can only exist one and only one set of basis vectors (else the basis is not well defined at that point). This condition is satisfied if and only if the equation system has a single solution, from [[linear algebra]], a linear equation system has a single solution (non-trivial) only if the determinant of its system matrix is non-zero:
:&lt;math&gt; \det(\mathbf{J}^{-1})  \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
which shows the rationale behind the above requirement concerning the inverse Jacobian determinant.

==Generalization to ''n'' dimensions==

The formalism extends to any finite dimension as follows.

Consider the [[real number|real]] [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] ''n''-dimensional space, that is '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = '''R''' × '''R''' × ... × '''R''' (''n'' times) where '''R''' is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real numbers]] and × denotes the [[Cartesian product]], which is a [[vector space]].

The [[coordinates]] of this space can be denoted by: '''x''' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''). Since this is a vector (an element of the vector space), it can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i\mathbf{e}^i &lt;/math&gt;

where '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = (1,0,0...,0), '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (0,1,0...,0), '''e'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = (0,0,1...,0),...,'''e'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = (0,0,0...,1) is the ''[[standard basis|standard]] [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] set of vectors'' for the space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''i'' = 1, 2,...''n'' is an index labelling components. Each vector has exactly one component in each dimension (or "axis") and they are mutually [[orthogonal vector|orthogonal]] ([[perpendicular]]) and normalized (has [[unit vector|unit magnitude]]).

More generally, we can define basis vectors '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; so that they depend on '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''q&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''), i.e. they change from point to point: '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;('''q'''). In which case to define the same point '''x''' in terms of this alternative basis: the ''[[coordinate vector|coordinates]]'' with respect to this basis ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' also necessarily depend on '''x''' also, that is ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''('''x'''). Then a vector '''v''' in this space, with respect to these alternative coordinates and basis vectors, can be expanded as a [[linear combination]] in this basis (which simply means to multiply each basis [[Coordinate vector|vector]] '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; by a number ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; – [[scalar multiplication]]):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \sum_{j=1}^n \bar{v}^j\mathbf{b}_j = \sum_{j=1}^n \bar{v}^j(\mathbf{q})\mathbf{b}_j(\mathbf{q}) &lt;/math&gt;

The vector sum that describes '''v''' in the new basis is composed of different vectors, although the sum itself remains the same.

==Transformation of coordinates==

From a more general and abstract perspective, a curvilinear coordinate system is simply a [[Atlas (topology)|coordinate patch]] on the [[differentiable manifold]] '''E'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (n-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]) that is [[Diffeomorphism|diffeomorphic]] to the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] coordinate patch on the manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Boothby | first=W. M. | year=2002 | title=An Introduction to Differential Manifolds and Riemannian Geometry | edition=revised | publisher=Academic Press | location=New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that two diffeomorphic coordinate patches on a differential manifold need not overlap differentiably. With this simple definition of a curvilinear coordinate system, all the results that follow below are simply applications of standard theorems in [[differential topology]].

The transformation functions are such that there's a one-to-one relationship between points in the "old" and "new" coordinates, that is, those functions are [[bijection]]s, and fulfil the following requirements within their [[domain of a function|domain]]s:
{{ordered list
|1= They are [[smooth function]]s: q&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; = q&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;('''x''')

|2= The inverse [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] determinant
:&lt;math&gt; J^{-1}=\begin{vmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial q^1}{\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial q^1}{\partial x_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial q^1}{\partial x_n} \\
\dfrac{\partial q^2}{\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial q^2}{\partial x_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial q^2}{\partial x_n} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\dfrac{\partial q^n}{\partial x_1} &amp; \dfrac{\partial q^n}{\partial x_2} &amp; \cdots &amp; \dfrac{\partial q^n}{\partial x_n}
\end{vmatrix} \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

is not zero; meaning the transformation is [[invertible]]: ''x&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt;('''q''').

according to the [[inverse function theorem]]. The condition that the Jacobian determinant is not zero reflects the fact that three surfaces from different families intersect in one and only one point and thus determine the position of this point in a unique way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=McConnell | first=A.

==Vector and tensor algebra in three-dimensional curvilinear coordinates==
{{Einstein_summation_convention}}
Elementary vector and tensor algebra in curvilinear coordinates is used in some of the older scientific literature in [[mechanics]] and [[physics]] and can be indispensable to understanding work from the early and mid-1900s, for example the text by Green and Zerna.&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite book | last1=Green | first1=A. E. | last2=Zerna | first2=W. | year=1968 | title=Theoretical Elasticity | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-853486-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some useful relations in the algebra of vectors and second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates are given in this section.

G. | year=2000 | title=Theory of Shells | volume=1 | publisher=Elsevier Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tensors in curvilinear coordinates==
{{main|Tensors in curvilinear coordinates}}
A second-order tensor can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;
   \boldsymbol{S} = S^{ij}\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j = S^i{}_j\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j = S_i{}^j\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j = S_{ij}\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\otimes&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[tensor product]]. The components ''S&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;'' are called the '''contravariant''' components, ''S&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' the '''mixed right-covariant''' components, ''S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;'' the '''mixed left-covariant''' components, and ''S&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' the '''covariant''' components of the second-order tensor. The components of the second-order tensor are related by

:&lt;math&gt; S^{ij} = g^{ik}S_k{}^j = g^{jk}S^i{}_k = g^{ik}g^{j\ell}S_{k\ell} &lt;/math&gt;

===The metric tensor in orthogonal curvilinear coordinates===
{{Main|Metric tensor}}

At each point, one can construct a small line element {{math|d'''x'''}}, so the square of the length of the line element is the scalar product d'''x''' • d'''x''' and is called the [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] of the [[space]], given by:

:&lt;math&gt;d\mathbf{x}\cdot d\mathbf{x} = \cfrac{\partial x_i}{\partial q^j}\cfrac{\partial x_i}{\partial q^k}dq^jdq^k
 &lt;/math&gt;.

The following portion of the above equation
:&lt;math&gt;  \cfrac{\partial x_k}{\partial q^i}\cfrac{\partial x_k}{\partial q^j} = g_{ij}(q^i,q^j) = \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j &lt;/math&gt;
is a ''symmetric'' tensor called the '''[[metric tensor|fundamental (or metric) tensor]]''' of the [[Euclidean space]] in curvilinear coordinates.

Indices can be [[raising and lowering indices|raised and lowered]] by the metric:
:&lt;math&gt; v^i = g^{ik}v_k &lt;/math&gt;

====Relation to Lamé coefficients====

Defining the scale factors ''h&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' by

:&lt;math&gt; h_ih_j = g_{ij} = \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j \quad \Rightarrow \quad h_i =\sqrt{g_{ii}}= \left|\mathbf{b}_i\right|=\left|\cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}\right| &lt;/math&gt;

gives a relation between the metric tensor and the Lamé coefficients. Note also that

:&lt;math&gt; g_{ij} = \cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^i}\cdot\cfrac{\partial\mathbf{x}}{\partial q^j}
= \left( h_{ki}\mathbf{e}_k\right)\cdot\left( h_{mj}\mathbf{e}_m\right)
= h_{ki}h_{kj} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''h&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the Lamé coefficients. For an orthogonal basis we also have:

:&lt;math&gt; g = g_{11}g_{22}g_{33} = h_1^2h_2^2h_3^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{g} = h_1h_2h_3 = J &lt;/math&gt;

====Example: Polar coordinates====

If we consider polar coordinates for '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, note that
:&lt;math&gt; (x, y)=(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta) &lt;/math&gt;
(r, θ) are the curvilinear coordinates, and the Jacobian determinant of the transformation (''r'',θ) → (''r'' cos θ, ''r'' sin θ) is ''r''.

The [[orthogonal]] basis vectors are '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = (cos θ, sin θ), '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt; = (−sin θ, cos θ).  The scale factors are ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''h''&lt;sub&gt;θ&lt;/sub&gt;= ''r''. The fundamental tensor is ''g''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; =1, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; =''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ''g''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = ''g''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; =0.

===The alternating tensor===

In an orthonormal right-handed basis, the third-order [[Levi-Civita symbol|alternating tensor]] is defined as

:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}} = \varepsilon_{ijk}\mathbf{e}^i\otimes\mathbf{e}^j\otimes\mathbf{e}^k &lt;/math&gt;

In a general curvilinear basis the same tensor may be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;
  \boldsymbol{\mathcal{E}} = \mathcal{E}_{ijk}\mathbf{b}^i\otimes\mathbf{b}^j\otimes\mathbf{b}^k
   = \mathcal{E}^{ijk}\mathbf{b}_i\otimes\mathbf{b}_j\otimes\mathbf{b}_k
&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be shown that
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathcal{E}^{ijk} = \cfrac{1}{J}\varepsilon_{ijk} = \cfrac{1}{+\sqrt{g}}\varepsilon_{ijk}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Christoffel symbols===

;[[Christoffel symbols]] of the first kind:

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{b}_{i,j} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{b}_i}{\partial q^j} = \Gamma_{ijk}\mathbf{b}^k \quad \Rightarrow \quad
\mathbf{b}_{i,j} \cdot \mathbf{b}_k = \Gamma_{ijk}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the comma denotes a [[partial derivative]] (see [[Ricci calculus]]). To express Γ&lt;sub&gt;''ijk''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' we note that

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
g_{ij,k} &amp; = (\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j)_{,k} = \mathbf{b}_{i,k}\cdot\mathbf{b}_j + \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_{j,k}
= \Gamma_{ikj} + \Gamma_{jki}\\
g_{ik,j} &amp; = (\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,j} = \mathbf{b}_{i,j}\cdot\mathbf{b}_k + \mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_{k,j}
= \Gamma_{ijk} + \Gamma_{kji}\\
g_{jk,i} &amp; = (\mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,i} = \mathbf{b}_{j,i}\cdot\mathbf{b}_k + \mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{b}_{k,i}
= \Gamma_{jik} + \Gamma_{kij}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{b}_{i,j} = \mathbf{b}_{j,i}\quad\Rightarrow\quad\Gamma_{ijk} = \Gamma_{jik}&lt;/math&gt;
using these to rearrange the above relations gives

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{ijk} = \frac{1}{2}(g_{ik,j} + g_{jk,i} - g_{ij,k}) = \frac{1}{2}[(\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,j} + (\mathbf{b}_j\cdot\mathbf{b}_k)_{,i} - (\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\mathbf{b}_j)_{,k}]
&lt;/math&gt;

;[[Christoffel symbols]] of the second kind:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma_{ij}{}^k = \Gamma_{ji}{}^k,\quad \cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}_i}{\partial q^j} = \Gamma_{ij}{}^k\mathbf{b}_k &lt;/math&gt;

This implies that
:&lt;math&gt; \Gamma_{ij}{}^k = \cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}_i}{\partial q^j}\cdot\mathbf{b}^k = -\mathbf{b}_i\cdot\cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}^k}{\partial q^j} &lt;/math&gt;

Other relations that follow are
:&lt;math&gt;
\cfrac{\partial \mathbf{b}^i}{\partial q^j} = -\Gamma^i{}_{jk}\mathbf{b}^k,\quad
\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{b}_i = \Gamma_{ij}{}^k\mathbf{b}_k\otimes\mathbf{b}^j,\quad
\boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{b}^i = -\Gamma_{jk}{}^i\mathbf{b}^k\otimes\mathbf{b}^j
&lt;/math&gt;

==Vector and tensor calculus in three-dimensional curvilinear coordinates==
{{Einstein_summation_convention}}

Adjustments need to be made in the calculation of [[line integral|line]], [[surface integral|surface]] and [[volume integral|volume]] [[integration (mathematics)|integrals]].  For simplicity, the following restricts to three dimensions and orthogonal curvilinear coordinates.  However, the same arguments apply for ''n''-dimensional spaces. When the coordinate system is not orthogonal, there are some additional terms in the expressions.

Simmonds,&lt;ref name=Simmonds/&gt; in his book on [[tensor analysis]], quotes [[Albert Einstein]] saying&lt;ref name=Lanczos&gt;{{cite book | last=Einstein | first=A. | year=1915 | contribution=Contribution to the Theory of General Relativity | editor=Laczos, C. | title=The Einstein Decade | page=213 | isbn=0-521-38105-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The magic of this theory will hardly fail to impose itself on anybody who has truly understood it; it represents a genuine triumph of the method of absolute differential calculus, founded by Gauss, Riemann, Ricci, and Levi-Civita.

Some useful relations in the calculus of vectors and second-order tensors in curvilinear coordinates are given in this section.  The notation and contents are primarily from Ogden,&lt;ref&gt;Ogden&lt;/ref&gt; Simmonds,&lt;ref name=Simmonds /&gt; Green and Zerna,&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;  Basar and Weichert,&lt;ref name=Basar/&gt; and Ciarlet.&lt;ref name=Ciarlet/&gt;

is a tangent vector to ''C'' in curvilinear coordinates (using the [[chain rule]]). Using the definition of the Lamé coefficients, and that for the metric ''g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0 when ''i'' ≠ ''j'', the magnitude is:

:&lt;math&gt; \left|{\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial \lambda} \right| = \sqrt{h_{ki}h_{kj}\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial \lambda}\cfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial \lambda}} = \sqrt{ g_{ij}\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial \lambda}\cfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial \lambda}} = \sqrt{h_{i}^2\left(\cfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial \lambda}\right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the above result,

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial \lambda_1}\times {\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial \lambda_2} =\left({\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^i}{\partial q^i \over \partial \lambda_1}\right) \times \left({\partial \mathbf{x} \over \partial q^j}{\partial q^j \over \partial \lambda_2}\right) = \mathcal{E}_{kmp}\left( h_{ki}{\partial q^i \over \partial \lambda_1}\right)\left(h_{mj}{\partial q^j \over \partial \lambda_2}\right) \mathbf{b}_p &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permutation symbol]]. In determinant form:

=\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{e}_1 &amp; \mathbf{e}_2 &amp; \mathbf{e}_3 \\
h_{1i} \dfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial \lambda_1} &amp; h_{2i} \dfrac{\partial q^i}{\partial \lambda_1} &amp; h_{3i} \dfrac{\partial q^i }{\partial \lambda_1} \\
h_{1j} \dfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial \lambda_2} &amp; h_{2j} \dfrac{\partial q^j}{\partial \lambda_2} &amp; h_{3j} \dfrac{\partial q^j }{\partial \lambda_2}

===Differentiation===

The expressions for the gradient, divergence, and Laplacian can be directly extended to ''n''-dimensions, however the curl is only defined in 3d.

The vector field '''b'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is tangent to the ''q&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' coordinate curve and forms a '''natural basis''' at each point on the curve.  This basis, as discussed at the beginning of this article, is also called the '''covariant''' curvilinear basis.  We can also define a '''reciprocal basis''', or '''contravariant''' curvilinear basis,  '''b'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;.  All the algebraic relations between the basis vectors, as discussed in the section on tensor algebra, apply for the natural basis and its reciprocal at each point '''x'''.

==Fictitious forces in general curvilinear coordinates==
By definition, if a particle with no forces acting on it has its position expressed in an inertial coordinate system, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''t''), then there it will have no acceleration (d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Michael | last1=Friedman | title=The Foundations of Space–Time Theories | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1989 | isbn=0-691-07239-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, a coordinate system can fail to be “inertial” either due to non-straight time axis or non-straight space axes (or both). In other words, the basis vectors of the coordinates may vary in time at fixed positions, or they may vary with position at fixed times, or both. When equations of motion are expressed in terms of any non-inertial coordinate system (in this sense), extra terms appear, called Christoffel symbols. Strictly speaking, these terms represent components of the absolute acceleration (in classical mechanics), but we may also choose to continue to regard d&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; as the acceleration (as if the coordinates were inertial) and treat the extra terms as if they were forces, in which case they are called fictitious forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=An Introduction to the Coriolis Force | first1=Henry M. | last1=Stommel | first2=Dennis W. | last2=Moore | year=1989 | publisher=Columbia University Press | isbn=0-231-06636-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The component of any such fictitious force normal to the path of the particle and in the plane of the path’s curvature is then called [[centrifugal force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Statics and Dynamics | last1=Beer | last2=Johnston | publisher=McGraw–Hill | edition=2nd | page=485 | year=1972 | isbn=0-07-736650-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This more general context makes clear the correspondence between the concepts of centrifugal force in [[rotating reference frame|rotating coordinate system]]s and in stationary curvilinear coordinate systems. (Both of these concepts appear frequently in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Methods of Applied Mathematics | authorlink=Francis B. Hildebrand | first=Francis B. |last=Hildebrand | year=1992 | publisher=Dover | page=156 | isbn=0-13-579201-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Statistical Mechanics | first=Donald Allan | last=McQuarrie | year=2000 | publisher=University Science Books | isbn=0-06-044366-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Essential Mathematical Methods for Physicists | first1=Hans-Jurgen | last1=Weber | first2=George Brown | last2=Arfken | authorlink2 = George B. Arfken | publisher=Academic Press | year=2004 | page=843 | isbn=0-12-059877-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;) For a simple example, consider a particle of mass ''m'' moving in a circle of radius ''r'' with angular speed ''w'' relative to a system of polar coordinates rotating with angular speed ''W''. The radial equation of motion is ''mr''”&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''mr''(''w''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''W'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus the centrifugal force is ''mr'' times the square of the absolute rotational speed ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''w''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''W'' of the particle. If we choose a coordinate system rotating at the speed of the particle, then ''W''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A'' and ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, in which case the centrifugal force is ''mrA''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas if we choose a stationary coordinate system we have ''W''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''w''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A'', in which case the centrifugal force is again ''mrA''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The reason for this equality of results is that in both cases the basis vectors at the particle’s location are changing in time in exactly the same way. Hence these are really just two different ways of describing exactly the same thing, one description being in terms of rotating coordinates and the other being in terms of stationary curvilinear coordinates, both of which are non-inertial according to the more abstract meaning of that term.

When describing general motion, the actual forces acting on a particle are often referred to the instantaneous osculating circle tangent to the path of motion, and this circle in the general case is not centered at a fixed location, and so the decomposition into centrifugal and Coriolis components is constantly changing. This is true regardless of whether the motion is described in terms of stationary or rotating coordinates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41480">The '''dialogical self''' is a [[psychological]] [[concept]] which describes the [[mind]]'s ability to imagine the different positions of [[wikt:participation|participant]]s in an internal [[dialogue]], in close connection with external dialogue. The "dialogical self" is the central concept in the dialogical self theory (DST), as created and developed by the Dutch psychologist [[Hubert Hermans]] since the 1990s.

== Overview ==
Dialogical Self Theory (DST) weaves two concepts, self and dialogue, together in such a way that a more profound understanding of the interconnection of [[Self (psychology)|self]] and [[society]] is achieved. Usually, the concept of self refers to something "internal," something that takes place within the mind of the individual [[person]], while dialogue is typically associated with something "external," that is, processes that take place between people involved in [[communication]].

The composite concept "dialogical self" goes beyond the self-other [[dichotomy]] by infusing the external to the internal and, in reverse, to introduce the internal into the external. As functioning as a "society of mind",&lt;ref&gt;Minsky, M. (1985). ''The Society of Mind''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt; the self is populated by a [[:wikt:multiplicity|multiplicity]] of "self-positions" that have the possibility to entertain dialogical relationships with each other.

In Dialogical Self Theory (DST) the self is considered as "extended," that is, individuals and groups in the society at large are incorporated as positions in the mini-society of the self. As a result of this extension, the self does not only include internal positions (e.g., I as the son of my mother, I as a teacher, I as a lover of jazz), but also external positions (e.g., my father, my pupils, the groups to which I belong).

Given the basic assumption of the extended self, the other is not simply outside the self but rather an intrinsic part of it. There is not only the actual other outside the self, but also the imagined other who is entrenched as the other-in-the-self. An important theoretical implication is that basic processes, like self-conflicts, [[self-criticism]], self-agreements, and self-consultancy, are taking place in different domains in the self: within the internal domain (e.g., "As an enjoyer of life I disagree with myself as an ambitious worker"); between the internal and external (extended) domain (e.g., "I want to do this but the voice of my mother in myself criticizes me") and within the external domain (e.g., "The way my colleagues interact with each other has led me to decide for another job").

As these examples show, there is not always a sharp separation between the inside of the self and the outside world, but rather a gradual transition.&lt;ref name="MR79"&gt;Rosenberg, M. (1979). ''Conceiving the self''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; DST assumes that the self as a society of mind is populated by internal and external self-positions. When some positions in the self silence or suppress other positions, monological relationships prevail. When, in contrast, positions are recognized and accepted in their differences and alterity (both within and between the internal and external domains of the self), dialogical relationships emerge with the possibility to further develop and renew the self and the other as central parts of the society at large.&lt;ref&gt;Hermans, H., Hermans-Konopka, A. (2010). ''Dialogical Self Theory. Positioning And Counter-Positioning In A Globalizing Society''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
DST is inspired by two thinkers in particular, [[William James]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], who worked in different countries (USA and Russia, respectively), in different disciplines ([[psychology]] and literary sciences), and in different theoretical traditions ([[pragmatism]] and [[dialogism]]).&lt;ref name="Herm2001"&gt;Hermans, H. (2001). The Dialogical Self: Toward a Theory of Personal and Cultural Positioning. ''Culture &amp; Psychology'', 2001, 7, 243-281&lt;/ref&gt; As the composite term dialogical self suggests, the present theory finds itself not exclusively in one of these traditions but explicitly at their intersection. As a theory about the self it is inspired by William James, as a theory about dialogue it elaborates on some insights of Mikhail Bakhtin. The purpose of the present theory is to profit from the insights of founding fathers like William James, [[George Herbert Mead]] and Mikhail Bakhtin and, at the same time, to go beyond them.

[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|[[William James]] (1890) proposed a distinction between the I and the Me.]]
William James (1890) proposed a distinction between the ''I'' and the ''Me'', which, according to Morris Rosenberg,&lt;ref name="MR79"/&gt; is a classic distinction in the psychology of the self. According to James the I is equated with the self-as-knower and has three features: continuity, distinctness, and [[Volition (psychology)|volition]].&lt;ref&gt;Damon, W., &amp; Hart, D. (1982). The development of self-understanding from infancy through adolescence. ''Child Development'', 4, 841-864.&lt;/ref&gt; The continuity of the self-as-knower is expressed in a sense of [[personal identity]], that is, a sense of sameness through time. A feeling of distinctness from others, or individuality, is also characteristic of the self-as-knower. Finally, a sense of personal volition is reflected in the continuous appropriation and rejection of thoughts by which the self-as-knower manifests itself as an active processor of experience.

Of particular relevance to DST is James's view that the ''Me'', equated with the self-as-known, is composed of the empirical elements considered as belonging to oneself. James was aware that there is a gradual transition between ''Me'' and ''mine'' and concluded that the empirical self is composed of all that the person can call his or her own, "not only his body and his psychic powers, but his clothes and his house, his wife and children, his ancestors and friends, his reputation and works, his lands and horses, and yacht and bank-account".&lt;ref&gt;James, W. (1890). ''The principles of psychology'' (Vol. 1). London: Macmillan, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, people and things in the environment belong to the self, as far as they are felt as "mine". This means that not only "my mother" belongs to the self but even "my enemy". In this way, James proposed a view in which the self is 'extended' to the environment. This proposal contrasts with a [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] view of the self which is based on a [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] conception, not only between [[Self (psychology)|self]] and [[Human body|body]] but also between self and other. With his conception of the extended self, that defined as going beyond the skin, James has paved the way for later theoretical developments in which other people and groups, defined as "mine" are part of a dynamic multi-voiced self.

[[File:Mikhail bakhtin.jpg|thumb|Mikhail Bakhtin (1920)]]
In the above quotation from William James, we see a constellation of characters (or self-positions) which he sees as belonging to the ''Me/mine'': my wife and children, my ancestors and friends. Such characters are more explicitly elaborated in Mikhail Bakhtin's&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtin, M. (1973). ''Problems of Dostoevsky's poetics'' (2nd edn.; R. W. Rotsel, Trans.). Ann Arbor, MI: Ardis. (Original work published 1929 as Problemy tvorchestva Dostoevskogo [Problems of Dostoevsky's Art]).&lt;/ref&gt; metaphor of the polyphonic novel, which became a source of inspiration for later dialogical approaches to the self. In proposing this metaphor, he draws on the idea that in [[Dostoevsky]]'s works there is not a single author at work—Dostoevsky himself—but several authors or thinkers, portrayed as characters such as [[Ivan Karamazov]], [[Prince Myshkin|Myshkin]], [[Raskolnikov]], [[Stavrogin]], and the [[Grand Inquisitor]].

These characters are not presented as obedient slaves in the service of one author-thinker, Dostoevsky, but treated as independent thinkers, each with their own view of the world. Each hero is put forward as the author of his own ideology, and not as the object of Dostoevsky's finalizing artistic vision. Rather than a multiplicity of characters within a unified world, there is a plurality of consciousnesses located in different worlds. As in a polyphonic musical composition, multiple voices accompany and oppose one another in dialogical ways. In bringing together different characters in a polyphonic construction, Dostoevsky creates a multiplicity of perspectives, portraying characters conversing with the [[Devil]] (Ivan and the Devil), with their [[alter ego]]s (Ivan and Smerdyakov), and even with caricatures of themselves (Raskolnikov and Svidrigailov).

Inspired by the original ideas of William James and Mikhail Bakhtin, [[Hubert Hermans]], [[Harry Kempen]] and Rens van Loon&lt;ref name="HKL92"&gt;Hermans, H. J. M., Kempen, H. J. G., &amp; Van Loon, R. J. P. (1992). The dialogical self: Beyond individualism and rationalism. ''American Psychologist'', 47, 23–33.&lt;/ref&gt;  wrote the first psychological publication on the "dialogical self" in which they conceptualized the self in terms of a dynamic multiplicity of relatively autonomous ''I''-positions in the (extended) landscape of the mind. In this conception, the ''I'' has the possibility to move from one spatial position to another in accordance with changes in situation and time. The ''I'' fluctuates among different and even opposed positions, and has the capacity to imaginatively endow each position with a voice so that dialogical relations between positions can be established. The voices function like interacting characters in a story, involved in processes of question and answer, agreement and disagreement. Each of them have a story to tell about their own experiences from their own stance. As different voices, these characters exchange information about their respective Me's and mines, resulting in a complex, narratively structured self.

== Construction of assessment and research procedures ==
[[File:Hubert Hermans.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hubert Hermans]] wrote the first psychological publication on the "dialogical self" in 1992.]]
The theory has led to the construction of different assessment and [[research]] procedures for investigating central aspects of the dialogical self. Hubert Hermans&lt;ref&gt;Hermans, H.J.M. (2001b). The construction of a personal position repertoire: Method and practice. ''Culture &amp; Psychology'', 7, 323-365.&lt;/ref&gt; has constructed the ''Personal Position Repertoire'' (PPR) method, an [[idiographic]] procedure for assessing the internal and external domains of the self in terms of an organized position repertoire.

This is done by offering the participant a list of internal and external self-positions. The participants mark those positions that they feel as relevant in their lives. They are allowed to add extra internal and external positions to the list and phrase them in their own terms. The relationship between internal and external positions is then established by inviting the participants to fill out a matrix with the rows representing the internal positions and the columns the external positions. In the entries of the matrix, the participant fills in, on a scale from 0 to 5 the extent to which an internal position is prominent in the relation to an external position. The scores in the matrix allow for the calculation of a number of indices, such as sum scores representing the overall prominence of particular internal or external positions and correlations showing the extent to which internal (or external) positions have similar profiles. On the basis of the results of the [[Mathematical psychology|quantitative analysis]], some positions can be selected, by the client or assessor, for closer examination.

From the selected positions the client can tell a story that reflects the specific experiences associated with that position and, moreover, assessor and client can explore which positions can be considered as a dialogical response to one or more other positions. In this way, the method combines both qualitative and quantitative analyses.

=== Psychometric aspects of the PPR method ===
The [[psychometric]] aspects of the PPR method was refined a procedure proposed by A. Kluger, Nir, &amp; Y. Kluger.&lt;ref&gt;Kluger, A., Nir, D., &amp; Kluger, Y. (2008). Personal position repertoire (PPR) from a bird's eye view. ''Journal of Constructivist Psychology'', 21, 223-238.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors analyze clients' Personal Position Repertoires by creating a [[bi-plot]] of the factors underlying their internal and external positions. A bi-plot provides a clear and comprehensible visual map of the relations between all the meaningful internal and external positions within the self in such a way that both types of positions are simultaneously visible. Through this procedure clusters of internal and external positions and dominant patterns can be easily observed and analyzed.

The method allows researchers or practitioners to study the general deep structures of the self. There are multiple bi-plots technologies available today. The simplest approach, however, is to perform a standard [[principal component analysis]] (PCA). To obtain a bi-plot, a PCA is once performed on the external positions and once on the internal positions, with the number of components in both PCA's restricted to two. Next, a scatter of the two PCAs is plotted on the same plane, where results of the first components are projected to the X-axis and of the second components to Y-axis. In this way, an overview of the organization of the internal and external positions together is realized.

=== The Personality Web assessment method ===
Another assessment method, the ''Personality Web'', is devised by Raggatt.&lt;ref name="LL08"/&gt; This semi-structured method starts from the assumption that the self is populated by a number of opposing narrative voices, with each voice having its own life story. Each voice competes with other voices for dominance in thought and action and each is constituted by a different set of affectively-charged attachments, to people, events, objects and one's own body.

The assessment comprises two phases— 
* In the first phase, 24 attachments are elicited in four categories: people, events, places and objects, and orientations to body parts. In an interview, the history and meaning of each attachment is explored.
* In the second phase, participants are invited to group their attachments by strength of association into [[cluster analysis]] and [[multidimensional scaling]] is used to map the individual's web of attachments.

This method represents a combination of [[qualitative property|qualitative]] and [[quantitative property|quantitative]] procedures that provide insight in the content and organization of a multi-voiced self.

=== Self-Confrontation Method ===
Dialogical relationships are also studied with an adapted version of the ''Self-Confrontation Method'' (SCM).&lt;ref&gt;Hermans, H.J.M., &amp; Hermans-Jansen, E. (1995). ''Self-narratives: The Construction of meaning in psychotherapy''. New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|0-89862-878-4}}. [Polish transl. by P. Oles, 2000, {{ISBN|83-88242-55-5}}.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Take the following example. A client, Mary, reported that she sometimes experienced herself as a witch, eager to murder her husband, particularly when he was drunk. She did a self-investigation in two parts, one from her ordinary position as Mary and another from the position of the witch. Then, she told from each of the positions a story about her past, present, and future. These stories were summarized in the form of a number of sentences. It appeared that Mary formulated sentences that were much more acceptable from a societal point of view than those from the witch. Mary formulated sentences like "I want to try to see what my mother gives me: there's only one of me" or "For the first time in my life, I'm engaged in making a home ("home" is also coming at home, entering into myself)", whereas the witch produced statements like "With my bland, pussycat qualities I have vulnerable things in hand, from which I derive power at a later moment (somebody tells me things that I can use so that I get what I want)" or "I enjoy when I have broken him [husband]: from a power position entering the battlefield."

It was found that the sentences of the two positions were very different in content, style, and affective meaning. Moreover, the relationship between Mary and the witch seemed to be more monological than dialogical, that is, either the one or the other was in control of the self and the situation and there was not no exchange between them. After the investigation, Mary received a therapeutic supervision during which she started to keep a diary in which she learned to make fine discriminations between her own experiences as Mary and those of the witch. She became not only aware of the needs of the witch but learned also to give an adequate response as soon as she noticed that the energy of the witch was upcoming. In a second investigation, one year later, the intensely conflicting relationship between Mary and the witch was significantly reduced and, as a result, there was less tension and stress in the self. She reported that in some situations, she even could make good use of the energy of the witch (e.g., when applying for a job). Whereas in some situations she was in control of the witch, in other situations she could even cooperate with her. The changes that took place between investigation 1 and investigation 2 suggested that the initial monological relationship between the two positions changed clearly into a more dialogical direction.

=== The Initial Questionnaire method ===
Under the supervision of the Polish psychologist Piotr Oleś, a group of researchers&lt;ref name="PTFR00"/&gt; constructed a [[questionnaire]] method, called the ''Initial Questionnaire'', for the measurement of three types of "internal activity" (a) change of perspective, (b) [[internal monologue]] and (c) internal dialogue. The purpose of this questionnaire is to induce the subject's self-reflection and determine which ''I''-positions are reflected by the participant's interlocutors and which of them give new and different points of view to the [[person]].

The method includes a list of potential positions. The participants are invited to choose some of them and can add their own to the list. The selected positions, both internal and external ones, are then assessed as belonging to the dialogue, monologue of perspective categories. Such a questionnaire is well-suited for the investigation of [[correlation]]s with other questionnaires.

For example, correlating the Initial Questionnaire with the [[Revised NEO Personality Inventory]] (NEO PI-R), the researchers found that persons having inner dialogues scored significantly lower on Assertiveness and higher on Self-Consciousness, Fantasy, Aesthetics, Feelings and Openness than people having internal monologues. They concluded that "people entering into imaginary dialogues in comparison with ones having mainly monologues are characterized by a more vivid and creative imagination (Fantasy), a deep appreciation of art and beauty (Aesthetics) and receptivity to inner feelings and emotions (Feelings). They are curious about both inner and outer worlds and their lives are experientially richer. They are willing to entertain novel ideas and unconventional values and they experience positive as well as negative emotions more keenly (Openness). At the same time these persons are more disturbed by awkward social situations, uncomfortable around others, sensitive to ridicule, and prone to feelings of inferiority (Self-Consciousness), they prefer to stay in the background and let others do the talking (Assertiveness)".&lt;ref name="PTFR00"/&gt;

=== Other methods ===
Other methods are developed in fields related to DST. Based on Stiles' assimilation model,&lt;ref&gt;Stiles, W. B. (1999). Signs and voices in psychotherapy. ''Psychotherapy Research'', 9, 1–21. Theory &amp; Psychology (2002), Special issue on the dialogical self, 12, 147-280.&lt;/ref&gt; "Osatuke et al.", describes a method that enables the researcher to compare what is said by a client (verbal content) and how it is said (speech sounds).&lt;ref&gt;Osatuke, K., Gray, M.A., Glick, M.J., Stiles, W.B., &amp; Barkham, M. (2004). Hearing voices: Metholodological issues in measuring internal multiplicity. In H. J. M. Hermans &amp; G. Dimaggio (Eds.), ''The dialogical self in psychotherapy'' (pp. 237-254). London: Brunner-Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; With this method the authors are able to assess to what extent the vocal manifestations (how it is said) of different internal voices of the same client parallel, contradict or complement their written manifestations (what is said). This method can be used to study the non-verbal characteristics of different voices in the self in connection with verbal content.

=== Dialogical sequence analysis ===
On the basis of Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of utterances, Leiman&lt;ref&gt;Leiman, M. (2004). Dialogical sequence analysis. In: H. J. M. Hermans &amp; G. Dimaggio (eds.), ''The dialogical self in psychotherapy'' (pp. 255–270). London: Brunner-Routledge.
&lt;/ref&gt; devised a ''dialogical sequence analysis.'' This method starts from the assumption that every utterance has an addressee. The central question is: To whom is the person speaking?

Usually, we think of one listener as the immediately observable addressee. However, the addressee is rather a multiplicity of others, a complex web of invisible others, whose presence can be traced in the content, flow and expressive elements of the utterance (e.g., I'm directly addressing you but while speaking I'm protesting to a third person who is invisibly present in the conversation). When there are more than one addressees present in the conversation, the utterance positions the author/speaker into more (metaphorical) locations. Usually, these locations form sequences, that can be examined and made explicit when one listens carefully not only to the content but also the expressive elements in the conversation. Leiman's method, which analyzes a conversation in terms of "chains of dialogical patterns", is theory-guided, qualitative and sensitive to the verbal and the non-verbal aspects of utterances.

== Fields of application ==
It is not the main purpose of the presented [[theory]] to formulate testable [[hypotheses]], but to generate new [[idea]]s. It is certainly possible to perform theory-guided [[research]] on the basis of the theory, as exemplified by a special issue on dialogical self research in the ''Journal of Constructivist Psychology'' (2008)&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~db=all~content=g793519042|title=Journal of Constructivist Psychology: Vol 21, No 3|website=www.informaworld.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other publications (further on in the present section). Yet, the primary purpose is the generation of new ideas that lead to continued theory, research, and practice on the basis of links between the central concepts of the theory.

Theoretical advances, empirical research, and practical applications are discussed in the ''International Journal for Dialogical Science''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijds.lemoyne.edu/index.html|title=International Journal for Dialogical Science|website=ijds.lemoyne.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the biennial ''International Conferences on the Dialogical Self'' as they are held in different countries and continents: [[Nijmegen]], [[Netherlands]] (2000), [[Ghent]], Belgium (2002), [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]] (2004), [[Braga]], [[Portugal]] (2006), [[Cambridge]], United Kingdom (2008), [[Athens]], [[Greece]] (2010), [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States (2012), and [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] (2014).The aim of the journal and the conferences is to  transcend the boundaries of (sub)disciplines, countries, and continents and create fertile interfaces where theorists, researchers and practitioners meet in order to engage in innovative dialogue.

Fields of applications are also reflected by several special issues that appeared in psychological journals. In ''Culture &amp; Psychology'' (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cap.sagepub.com/|title=Culture &amp; Psychology: SAGE Journals|website=cap.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; DST, as a theory of personal and cultural positioning, was exposed and commented on by researchers from different cultures. In ''Theory &amp; Psychology'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol12/issue2/|title=Theory &amp; Psychology - Volume 12, Number 2, Apr 01, 2002|website=tap.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the potential contribution of the theory for a variety of fields was discussed: developmental psychology, personality psychology, psychotherapy, psychopathology, brain sciences, cultural psychology, Jungian psychoanalysis, and [[semiotic]] dialogism. A second issue of this journal published in 2010 was also devoted to DST.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tap.sagepub.com/content/20/3/|title=Theory &amp; Psychology - Volume 20, Number 3, Jun 01, 2010|website=tap.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Journal of Constructivist Psychology'' (2003) researchers and practitioners focused on the implications of the dialogical self for personal construct psychology, on the [[philosophy]] of [[Martin Buber]], on the rewriting of [[narrative]]s in psychotherapy, and on a psycho-dramatic approach in psychotherapy. The topic of mediated dialogue in a global and digital age was at the heart of a special issue in ''Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/sociology/identity/|title=''Identity: An International Journal of Theory and Research'' (2004)|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131073327/http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/sociology/identity/|archivedate=2009-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Counselling Psychology Quarterly'' (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/ccpq/2006/00000019/00000001;jsessionid=52agw1b0alg29.alice|title=Counselling Psychology Quarterly: Ingenta Connect Table Of Contents|website=www.ingentaconnect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dialogical self was applied to a variety of topics, such as, the relationship between adult attachment and working models of [[emotion]], [[paranoid personality disorder]], narrative impoverishment in [[schizophrenia]], and the significance of social power in psychotherapy. In the ''Journal of Constructivist Psychology'' (2008)&lt;ref name="informaworld.com"/&gt; and in ''Studia Psychologica''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wydawnictwo.uksw.edu.pl/sklep/?p=productsMore&amp;iProduct=605&amp;sName=studia-psychologica-8-2008 ''Studia Psychologica'' (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; (2008), groups of researchers addressed the question of how empirical research can be performed on the basis of DST. The relevance of the dialogical self to developmental psychology was discussed in a special issue of ''New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development'' (2012). The application of the dialogical self in educational settings was presented in a special issue of the ''Journal of Constructivist Psychology'' (2013).

== Evaluation ==
Since its first inception in 1992, DST is discussed and evaluated, particularly at the biennial ''International Conferences on the Dialogical Self'' and in the ''International Journal for Dialogical Science''. Some of the main positive evaluations and main criticisms are summarized here. On the positive side, many researchers appreciate the breadth and the integrative character of the theory. As the above review of applications demonstrates, there is a broad range of fields in psychology and other disciplines in which the theory has received interests from thinkers, researchers and practitioners. The breadth of interest is also reflected by the range of [[scientific]] journals that have devoted special issues to the theory and its implications.

The theory has the potential to bring together scientists and practitioners from a variety of countries, continents and cultures. The ''Fifth International Conference on the Dialogical Self'' in Cambridge, United Kingdom attracted 300 participants from 43 countries.  The conference focused primarily on DST, and dialogism as a related field. However, by focusing on dialogue, dialogical self goes beyond the [[post-modernism]] idea of the decentralization of the self and the notion of fragmentation. Recent work by John Rowan has resulted in the publication of a book by him entitled - 'Personification: Using the Dialogical Self in Psychotherapy and Counselling' published by Routledge. The book shows how to apply the concepts by those working in the therapeutic field.

=== Criticism ===
The theory and its applications have also received several [[criticism]]. Many researchers have noted a discrepancy between theory and research. Certainly, more than most post-modernist approaches, the theory has instigated a variety of empirical studies and some of its main tenets are confirmed in experimental social-psychological research.&lt;ref name="SZWG06"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stemplewska-Zakowicz, K., Walecka, J., Gabinska, A., Zalewski, B., &amp; Zuszek, H. (2005). Experiments on positioning, positioning the experiments. In P. Oles &amp; H. J. M. Hermans (Eds.), ''The dialogical self: Theory and research'' (pp. 183–199). Lublin, Poland: Wydawnictwo KUL.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the gap between theory and research still exists.

Closely related to this gap, there is the lack of connection between dialogical self research and mainstream psychology. Although the theory and its applications have been published in mainstream journals like ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]'' and the ''[[American Psychologist]]'', it has not yet led to the adoption of the theory as a significant development in mainstream (American) [[psychology]]. Apart from the theory-research gap, one of the additional reasons for the lacking connection with mainstream research may be the fact that interest in the notion of dialogue, central in the [[history of philosophy]] since [[Plato]], is largely neglected in psychology and other [[social sciences]]. Another disadvantage of the theory is that it lacks a research procedure that is sufficiently common to allow for the exchange of research data among investigators. Although different research tools have been developed (see the above review of assessment and research methods), none of them are used by a majority of researchers in the field.

Investigators often use different research tools which lead to a considerable richness of information but, at the same time, create a stumbling block for the comparison of research data. It seems that the breadth of the theory and the richness of its applications have a shadowy side in the relative isolation of research in the DST subfields. Other researchers find the scientific work done thus far to be of a too verbal nature. While the theory explicitly acknowledges the importance of pre-linguistic, non-linguistic forms of dialogue,&lt;ref name="JB02"/&gt; the actual research is typically taking place on the verbal level with the simultaneous neglect of the non-verbal level (for a notable exception cultural-anthropological research on shape-shifting).&lt;ref name="Gieser, T. 2006"/&gt; Finally, some researchers would like to see more emphasis on the bodily aspects of dialogue.  Up till now the theory has focused almost exclusively on the transcendence of the self-other dualism, as typical of the modern model of the self. More work should be done on the embodied nature of the dialogical self (for the role of the body in connection with emotions).&lt;ref&gt;Hermans, H.J.M., &amp; Hermans-Konopka, A. (2010).''Dialogical self theory: Positioning and counter-positioning in a globalizing society''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topology]], a '''discrete space''' is a particularly simple example of a [[topological space]] or similar structure, one in which the points form a ''discontinuous sequence'', meaning they are ''[[Isolated point|isolated]]'' from each other in a certain sense. The discrete topology is the [[Comparison of topologies|finest]] topology that can be given on a set, i.e., it defines all subsets as open sets. In particular, each [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] is an open set in the discrete topology.

== Definitions ==
Given a set ''X'':
* the '''discrete topology''' on ''X'' is defined by letting every [[subset]] of ''X'' be [[open set|open]] (and hence also [[closed set|closed]]), and ''X'' is a '''discrete topological space''' if it is equipped with its discrete topology;
* the '''discrete [[uniform space|uniformity]]''' on ''X'' is defined by letting every [[superset]] of the diagonal {(''x'',''x'')&amp;nbsp;: ''x'' is in ''X''} in ''X''&amp;nbsp;× ''X'' be an [[Entourage (topology)#Entourage definition|entourage]], and ''X'' is a '''discrete uniform space''' if it is equipped with its discrete uniformity.
* the '''discrete [[metric space|metric]]''' &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; on ''X'' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,y) = 
\left\{\begin{matrix} 
1 &amp;\mbox{if}\ x\neq y , \\
0 &amp;\mbox{if}\ x = y
\end{matrix}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;
for any &lt;math&gt;x,y \in X&lt;/math&gt;. In this case &lt;math&gt;(X,\rho)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''discrete metric space''' or a '''space of [[isolated point]]s'''.
* a [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is '''discrete''' in a [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, if for every &lt;math&gt;x \in S&lt;/math&gt;, there exists some &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt;0&lt;/math&gt; (depending on &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) such that &lt;math&gt;d(x,y) &gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;y \in S\setminus\{x\}&lt;/math&gt;; such a set consists of [[isolated point]]s.  A set ''S'' is '''uniformly discrete''' in the [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;S \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt;, if there exists ''ε'' &gt; 0 such that for any two distinct &lt;math&gt;x, y \in S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;d(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; &gt;  ''ε''.

A metric space &lt;math&gt;(E,d)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''[[uniformly discrete set|uniformly discrete]]'' if there exists a "packing radius" &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that, for any &lt;math&gt;x,y \in E&lt;/math&gt;, one has either &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | zbl=0982.52018 | last=Pleasants | first=Peter A.B. | chapter=Designer quasicrystals: Cut-and-project sets with pre-assigned properties | editor1-last=Baake | editor1-first=Michael | title=Directions in mathematical quasicrystals | location=Providence, RI | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | series=CRM Monograph Series | volume=13 | pages=95–141 | year=2000 | isbn=0-8218-2629-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The topology underlying a metric space can be discrete, without the metric being uniformly discrete: for example the usual metric on the set {1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...} of real numbers.

{{Collapse top|title=Proof that a discrete space is not necessarily uniformly discrete }}
Let X = {1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...}, consider this set using the usual metric on the real numbers. Then, X is a discrete space, since for each point 1/2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, we can surround it with the interval (1/2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; - ɛ, 1/2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + ɛ), where ɛ = 1/2(1/2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; - 1/2&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1/2&lt;sup&gt;n+2&lt;/sup&gt;. The intersection (1/2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; - ɛ, 1/2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + ɛ) &amp;cap; {1/2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;} is just the singleton {1/2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;}. Since the intersection of two open sets is open, and singletons are open, it follows that X is a discrete space.

However, X cannot be uniformly discrete. To see why, suppose there exists an r&gt;0 such that d(x,y)&gt;r whenever x≠y. It suffices to show that there are at least two points x and y in X that are closer to each other than r. Since the distance between adjacent points 1/2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; and 1/2&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt; is 1/2&lt;sup&gt;n+1&lt;/sup&gt;, we need to find an n that satisfies this inequality:

&lt;math&gt;
1/2^{n+1} &lt; r
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
1 &lt; r2^{n+1}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
1/r &lt; 2^{n+1}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\log_2(1/r) &lt; n+1
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
-\log_2(r) &lt; n+1
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
-1 - \log_2(r) &lt; n
&lt;/math&gt;

Since there is always an n bigger than any given real number, it follows that there will always be at least two points in X that are closer to each other than any positive r, therefore X is not uniformly discrete.

== Properties ==
The underlying uniformity on a discrete metric space is the discrete uniformity, and the underlying topology on a discrete uniform space is the discrete topology.
Thus, the different notions of discrete space are compatible with one another.
On the other hand, the underlying topology of a non-discrete uniform or metric space can be discrete; an example is the metric space ''X''&amp;nbsp;:= {1/''n''&amp;nbsp;: ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 1,2,3,...} (with metric inherited from the [[real line]] and given by d(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;= |''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus; ''y''|).
Obviously, this is not the discrete metric; also, this space is not [[complete (topology)|complete]] and hence not discrete as a uniform space.
Nevertheless, it is discrete as a topological space.
We say that ''X'' is ''topologically discrete'' but not ''uniformly discrete'' or ''metrically discrete''.

Additionally:
* The [[topological dimension]] of a discrete space is equal to 0.
* A topological space is discrete if and only if its [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s are open, which is the case if and only if it doesn't contain any [[accumulation point]]s.
* The singletons form a [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the discrete topology.
* A uniform space ''X'' is discrete if and only if the diagonal {(''x'',''x'')&amp;nbsp;: ''x'' is in ''X''} is an [[entourage (topology)|entourage]].
* Every discrete topological space satisfies each of the [[separation axioms]]; in particular, every discrete space is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], that is, separated.
* A discrete space is [[compact space|compact]] [[if and only if]] it is [[finite set|finite]].
* Every discrete uniform or metric space is [[complete space|complete]].
* Combining the above two facts, every discrete uniform or metric space is [[totally bounded space|totally bounded]] if and only if it is finite.
* Every discrete metric space is [[bounded space|bounded]].
* Every discrete space is [[first-countable space|first-countable]]; it is moreover [[second-countable space|second-countable]] if and only if it is [[countable]].
* Every discrete space is [[totally disconnected]].
* Every non-empty discrete space is [[second category]].
* Any two discrete spaces with the same [[cardinality]] are [[homeomorphic]].
* Every discrete space is metrizable (by the discrete metric).
* A finite space is metrizable only if it is discrete.
* If ''X'' is a topological space and ''Y'' is a set carrying the discrete topology, then ''X'' is evenly covered by {{nowrap|''X'' × ''Y''}} (the projection map is the desired covering)
* The [[subspace topology]] on the [[integers]] as a subspace of the [[real line]] is the discrete topology.
*A discrete space is separable if and only if it is countable.

Any function from a discrete topological space to another topological space is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]], and any function from a discrete uniform space to another uniform space is [[uniformly continuous]]. That is, the discrete space ''X'' is [[free object|free]] on the set ''X'' in the [[category theory|category]] of topological spaces and continuous maps or in the category of uniform spaces and uniformly continuous maps. These facts are examples of a much broader phenomenon, in which discrete structures are usually free on sets.

With metric spaces, things are more complicated, because there are several categories of metric spaces, depending on what is chosen for the [[morphism]]s. Certainly the discrete metric space is free when the morphisms are all uniformly continuous maps or all continuous maps, but this says nothing interesting about the metric [[Mathematical structure|structure]], only the uniform or topological structure. Categories more relevant to the metric structure can be found by limiting the morphisms to [[Lipschitz continuous]] maps or to [[short map]]s; however, these categories don't have free objects (on more than one element). However, the discrete metric space is free in the category of [[bounded metric space]]s and Lipschitz continuous maps, and it is free in the category of metric spaces bounded by 1 and short maps. That is, any function from a discrete metric space to another bounded metric space is Lipschitz continuous, and any function from a discrete metric space to another metric space bounded by 1 is short.

Going the other direction, a function ''f'' from a topological space ''Y'' to a discrete space ''X'' is continuous if and only if it is ''[[locally constant function|locally constant]]'' in the sense that every point in ''Y'' has a [[topological neighborhood|neighborhood]] on which ''f'' is constant.

== Uses ==

A discrete structure is often used as the "default structure" on a set that doesn't carry any other natural topology, uniformity, or metric; discrete structures can often be used as "extreme" examples to test particular suppositions. For example, any [[group (mathematics)|group]] can be considered as a [[topological group]] by giving it the discrete topology, implying that theorems about topological groups apply to all groups. Indeed, analysts may refer to the ordinary, non-topological groups studied by algebraists as "[[discrete group]]s" . In some cases, this can be usefully applied, for example in combination with [[Pontryagin duality]]. A 0-dimensional [[manifold]] (or differentiable or analytical manifold) is nothing but a discrete topological space. We can therefore view any discrete group as a 0-dimensional [[Lie group]].

A [[product topology|product]] of [[countably infinite]] copies of the discrete space of [[natural number]]s is [[homeomorphic]] to the space of [[irrational number]]s, with the homeomorphism given by the [[continued fraction]] expansion. A product of countably infinite copies of the discrete space [[2 (number)|{0,1}]] is homeomorphic to the [[Cantor set]]; and in fact [[uniformly homeomorphic]] to the Cantor set if we use the [[product uniformity]] on the product. Such a homeomorphism is given by using [[Ternary numeral system|ternary notation]] of numbers. (See [[Cantor space]].)

In the [[foundations of mathematics]], the study of [[compact space|compactness]] properties of products of {0,1} is central to the topological approach to the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem|ultrafilter principle]], which is a weak form of [[axiom of choice|choice]].

== Indiscrete spaces ==
{{main|Trivial topology}}

In some ways, the opposite of the discrete topology is the [[trivial topology]] (also called the ''indiscrete topology''), which has the fewest possible open sets (just the [[empty set]] and the space itself). Where the discrete topology is initial or free, the indiscrete topology is final or [[cofree]]: every function ''from'' a topological space ''to'' an indiscrete space is continuous, etc.

In [[mathematics]], a [[category (category theory)|category]] is '''distributive''' if it has finite [[product (category theory)|product]]s and finite [[coproduct (category theory)|coproduct]]s such that for every choice of objects &lt;math&gt;A,B,C&lt;/math&gt;, the canonical map

: &lt;math&gt;[\mathit{id}_A \times\iota_1, \mathit{id}_A \times\iota_2] : A\times B + A\times C\to A\times(B+C)&lt;/math&gt;

is an [[isomorphism]], and for all objects &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the canonical map &lt;math&gt;0 \to A\times 0&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism (where 0 denotes the [[initial object]]). Equivalently. if for every object &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the [[endofunctor]] &lt;math&gt;A\times -&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;B\mapsto A\times B&lt;/math&gt; preserves coproducts up to isomorphisms &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Paul|title=Practical Foundations of Mathematics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and aforementioned canonical maps are equal for each choice of objects. 

In particular, if the functor &lt;math&gt;A\times -&lt;/math&gt; has a right [[adjoint functors|adjoint]] (i.e., if the category is [[cartesian closed category|cartesian closed]]), it necessarily preserves all colimits, and thus any cartesian closed category with finite coproducts (i.e., any [[bicartesian closed category]]) is distributive.

== Example ==

The [[category of sets]] is distributive. Let {{var|A}}, {{var|B}}, and {{var|C}} be sets. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  A\times (B\amalg C) 
  &amp;= \{(a,d)|a\in A\text{ and }d\in B\amalg C\} \\
  &amp;\cong \{(a,d)|a\in A\text{ and }d\in B\}\amalg \{(a,d)|a\in A\text{ and }d\in C\} \\
  &amp;= (A\times B)\amalg (A\times C)

where &lt;math&gt;\amalg&lt;/math&gt; denotes the coproduct in '''Set''', namely the [[disjoint union]], and &lt;math&gt;\cong&lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[bijection]].  In the case where {{var|A}}, {{var|B}}, and {{var|C}} are [[finite sets]], this result reflects the [[distributive property]]: the above sets each have cardinality &lt;math&gt;|A|\cdot (|B|+|C|)=|A|\cdot|B|+|A|\cdot |C|&lt;/math&gt;.

The category '''[[category of groups|Grp]]''' is not distributive, even though it has both products and coproducts.

An even simpler category that has both products and coproducts but is not distributive is the category of [[pointed set]]s.&lt;ref name="LawvereSchanuel2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. W.

The '''Electronic Visualisation and the Arts''' conferences ('''EVA Conferences''' for short, aka '''Electronic Information, the Visual Arts and Beyond''') are a series of international interdisciplinary conferences mainly in Europe, but also elsewhere in the world, for people interested in the application of information technology to the cultural and especially the [[visual arts]] field, including [[Art gallery|art galleries]] and museums.&lt;ref&gt;Online: Electronic imaging, the visual arts and beyond. ''[[New Heritage]]'', 05.02:7, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
Started in London (UK), there are now EVA conferences in [[Berlin]] (Germany), [[Florence]] (Italy), [[Jerusalem]] (Israel), [[St Petersburg]] (formerly in Moscow, Russia), [[Australasia]] (first time in [[Canberra]], Australia in 2016) and other major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eva-london.org/international/ | title=EVA Conferences International | work=EVA London Concerence | accessdate=11 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first EVA Conference was held at [[Imperial College, London|Imperial College]], London in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article | title=News and Events: European session at the EVA 2002 | url=http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue7/mag-news/ | volume=Issue 7 | journal=Cultivate Interactive | publisher=[[Archive.org]] | date=July 2002 | deadurl=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020723184553/http://www.cultivate-int.org/issue7/mag-news/ | archivedate=23 July 2002 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; organised by the founders [[James Hemsley]], [[Kirk Martinez]], and Anthony Hamber.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10057">'''Evolutionism''' describes the belief in the [[evolution]] of [[Organism|organisms]]. Its exact meaning has changed over time as the study of evolution has progressed. In the 19th-century, it was used to describe the belief that organisms deliberately improved themselves through progressive inherited change ([[orthogenesis]]).&lt;ref name="isbn0-550-11000-3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Carneiro | first=Robert, L. | title=Evolutionism in cultural anthropology : a critical history | publisher=Westview Press | location=Cambridge, MA | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-8133-3766-1 | pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[teleological]] belief went on to include [[cultural evolution]] and [[social evolution]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-550-11000-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Allen, R.

The belief was also extended to cultures and societies, and to living organisms. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s the term Neo-Evolutionism was used to describe the idea "that human beings sought to preserve a familiar style of life unless change was forced on them by factors that were beyond their control".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Trigger|Trigger, Bruce]]  (1986) ''A History of Archeological Thought'' Cambridge University Press pg 290&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also sometimes used by the [[Creationism|creationist movement]] to describe adherence to the scientific consensus on evolution as equivalent to a [[secular religion]].&lt;ref name="ICRMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/icr-visit/linke.html|title=A Visit to the ICR Museum|author=Linke, Steven|date=August 28, 1992|publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]|accessdate=2008-12-05|quote=In fact, true science supports the Biblical worldview...

B. |year=1983 |publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |accessdate=2009-09-24}} "...to say a person is a scientist encompasses the fact that he or she is an evolutionist."&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[creation-evolution controversy|creation{{endash}}evolution controversy]], creationists often call those who accept the validity of the modern evolutionary synthesis "evolutionists" and the theory itself "evolutionism".

==19th-century teleological use ==
Before its use to describe biological evolution, the term "evolution" was originally used to refer to any orderly sequence of events with the outcome somehow contained at the start.&lt;ref name=Carneiro&gt;Carneiro, Robert L.(Léonard) (2003) ''Evolutionism in cultural anthropology: a critical history'' Westview Press pg 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; The first five editions of Darwin's in ''Origin of Species'' used the word "evolved", but the word "evolution" was only used in its sixth edition in 1872.&lt;ref name="penguin origin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Origin of Species|year=1986|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex, England|isbn=0-14-043205-1|edition=reprint of 1st|editor=Burrow, JW|page=460|quote=...from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, ''evolved'' (italics not in original)}}&lt;/ref&gt; By then, [[Herbert Spencer]] had developed the concept theory that organisms strive to evolve due to an internal "driving force" ([[orthogenesis]]) in 1862.&lt;ref name=Carneiro/&gt;  Edward B. Tylor and Lewis H Morgan brought the term "evolution" to anthropology though they tended toward the older pre-Spencerian definition helping to form the concept of [[unilineal evolution|unilineal (social) evolution]] used during the later part of what Trigger calls the Antiquarianism-Imperial Synthesis period (c1770-c1900).&lt;ref&gt;Trigger, Bruce (1986) ''A History of Archaeological Thought'' Cambridge University Press pg 102&lt;/ref&gt; The term evolutionism subsequently came to be used for the now discredited theory that evolution contained a deliberate component, rather than the selection of [[Beneficial mutation|beneficial traits]] from [[Genetic variation|random variation]] by [[Survival of the fittest|differential survival]].

==Modern use by creationists==
In modern times, the term ''[[evolution]]'' is widely used, but the terms ''evolutionism'' and ''evolutionist'' are seldom used in the [[scientific community]] to refer to [[evolutionary biology]], since the term is considered both redundant and anachronistic. 

However, the term has been used by creationists in discussing the [[creation-evolution controversy]].&lt;ref name="Dichotomy" /&gt; For example, the [[Institute for Creation Research]], in order to imply placement of evolution in the category of 'religions', including [[atheism]], [[fascism]], [[humanism]] and [[occultism]], commonly uses the words ''evolutionism'' and ''evolutionist'' to describe the consensus of mainstream science and the scientists subscribing to it, thus implying through language that the issue is a matter of religious belief.&lt;ref name=ICRMuseum/&gt; The [[BioLogos Foundation]], an organization that promotes the idea of [[theistic evolution]], uses the term "evolutionism" to describe "the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse." It views this as a subset of [[scientism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biologos.org/questions/biologos-id-creationism|title=How is BioLogos different from Evolutionism, Intelligent Design, and Creationism|publisher=The BioLogos Foundation|quote= While BioLogos accepts evolution, it emphatically rejects evolutionism, the atheistic worldview that so often accompanies the acceptance of biological evolution in public discourse. Proponents of evolutionism believe every aspect of life will one day be explained with evolutionary theory. In this way it is a subset of scientism, the broader view that the only real truth is that which can be discovered by science. These positions are commonly held by materialists (also called philosophical naturalists) who deny the existence of the supernatural.|accessdate=2012-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}

'''Fear''' is a feeling induced by perceived danger or [[threat]] that occurs in certain types of [[organisms]], which causes a change in metabolic and organ functions and ultimately a change in [[behavior]], such as fleeing, hiding, or freezing from perceived traumatic events. Fear in human beings may occur in response to a specific [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] occurring in the present, or in anticipation or expectation of a future threat perceived as a [[risk]] to body or life. The fear response arises from the [[perception]] of [[Risk|danger]] leading to confrontation with or escape from/avoiding the threat (also known as the [[fight-or-flight response]]), which in extreme cases of fear ([[horror and terror]]) can be a freeze response or [[paralysis]]. 
 
In humans and animals, fear is modulated by the process of [[cognition]] and learning. Thus fear is judged as [[rational]] or appropriate and [[irrational]] or inappropriate. An '''irrational fear''' is called a [[phobia]].

[[Psychologist]]s such as [[John B. Watson]], [[Robert Plutchik]], and [[Paul Ekman]] have suggested that there is only a small set of basic or [[innate]] emotions and that fear is one of them. This hypothesized set includes such emotions as [[acute stress reaction]], [[anger]], [[angst]], [[anxiety]], fright, [[Horror (emotion)|horror]], [[joy]], [[panic]], and [[sadness]]. Fear is closely related to, but should be distinguished from, the emotion [[anxiety]], which occurs as the result of threats that are perceived to be uncontrollable or unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Öhman, A. (2000). "Fear and anxiety: Evolutionary, cognitive, and clinical perspectives". In M. Lewis &amp; J. M. Haviland-Jones (Eds.). ''Handbook of emotions''. pp. 573–593. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The fear response serves survival by generating appropriate behavioral responses, so it has been preserved throughout [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=Olsson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Olsson | first1 = A. | last2 = Phelps | first2 = E. A. | doi = 10.1038/nn1968 | title = Social learning of fear | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 10 | issue = 9 | pages = 1095–1102 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17726475| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological and organizational research also suggests that individuals’ fears are not solely dependent on their nature but are also shaped by their social relations and culture, which guide their understanding of when and how much fear to feel.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, M.J. and Burrow, R., 2017. The function of fear in institutional maintenance: Feeling frightened as an essential ingredient in haute cuisine. Organization Studies&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Fear''' is a primeval emotion that humans have known since they were very young. Even as a child, humans typically have not experienced real fear at this age, but a child develops a fear of the monster in their closet.

==Signs and symptoms==
Many physiological changes in the body are associated with fear, summarized as the [[fight-or-flight response]]. An inborn response for coping with danger, it works by accelerating the breathing rate ([[hyperventilation]]), heart rate, vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels leading to blushing and sanskadania of the central vessels (pooling),  increasing muscle tension including the muscles attached to each hair follicle to contract and causing "goose bumps", or more clinically, [[piloerection]] (making a cold person warmer or a frightened animal look more impressive), sweating, increased blood glucose ([[hyperglycemia]]), increased serum calcium, increase in white blood cells called neutrophilic leukocytes, alertness leading to sleep disturbance and "butterflies in the stomach" ([[dyspepsia]]). This primitive mechanism may help an organism survive by either running away or fighting the danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edmundson|first=Laurel Duphiney|title=The Neurobiology of Fear|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro00/web2/Edmundson.html|publisher=Serendip|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the series of physiological changes, the consciousness realizes an emotion of fear.

==Causes==
People develop specific fears as a result of learning. This has been studied in psychology as [[fear conditioning]], beginning with John B. Watson's [[Little Albert experiment]] in 1920, which was inspired after observing a child with an irrational fear of dogs. In this study, an 11-month-old boy was conditioned to fear a white rat in the laboratory. The fear became generalized to include other white, furry objects, such as a rabbit, dog, and even a ball of cotton.

Fear can be learned by experiencing or watching a frightening traumatic accident. For example, if a child falls into a well and struggles to get out, he or she may develop a fear of wells, heights ([[acrophobia]]), enclosed spaces ([[claustrophobia]]), or water ([[aquaphobia]]). There are studies looking at areas of the brain that are affected in relation to fear. When looking at these areas (such as the amygdala), it was proposed that a person learns to fear regardless of whether they themselves have experienced trauma, or if they have observed the fear in others. In a study completed by Andreas Olsson, Katherine I. Nearing and Elizabeth A. Phelps, the amygdala were affected both when subjects observed someone else being submitted to an aversive event, knowing that the same treatment awaited themselves, and when subjects were subsequently placed in a fear-provoking situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that fear can develop in both conditions, not just simply from personal history.

Fear is affected by cultural and historical context. For example, in the early 20th century, many Americans feared [[polio]], a disease that can lead to paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001402.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-01-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129024916/https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001402.htm |archivedate=2017-01-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are consistent cross-cultural differences in how people respond to fear.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Display rules]] affect how likely people are to show the facial expression of fear and other emotions.

Although many fears are learned, the capacity to fear is part of [[human nature]]. Many studies {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} have found that certain fears (e.g. animals, heights) are much more common than others (e.g. flowers, clouds). These fears are also easier to induce in the laboratory. This phenomenon is known as [[preparedness (learning)|preparedness]]. Because early humans that were quick to fear dangerous situations were more likely to survive and reproduce, preparedness is theorized to be a genetic effect that is the result of [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Öhman|first1=Arne|last2=Mineka|first2=Susan|title=Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning|journal=Psychological Review|date=2001|volume=108|issue=3|pages=483–522|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.483|pmid=11488376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, different fears may be different [[adaptation]]s that have been useful in our evolutionary past. They may have developed during different time periods. Some fears, such as fear of heights, may be common to all [[mammal]]s and developed during the [[mesozoic]] period. Other fears, such as fear of snakes, may be common to all [[simian]]s and developed during the [[cenozoic]] time period. Still others, such as fear of mice and insects, may be unique to humans and developed during the [[paleolithic]] and [[neolithic]] time periods (when mice and insects become important carriers of infectious diseases and harmful for crops and stored foods).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bracha | first1 = H. | title = Human brain evolution and the "Neuroevolutionary Time-depth Principle:" Implications for the Reclassification of fear-circuitry-related traits in DSM-V and for studying resilience to warzone-related posttraumatic stress disorder | doi = 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.01.008 | journal = Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 5 | pages = 827–853 | year = 2006 | pmid =  16563589| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fear of death===
{{Main|Fear of death}}
Death anxiety is multidimensional; it covers "fears related to one's own death, the death of others, fear of the unknown after death, fear of obliteration, and fear of the dying process, which includes fear of a slow death and a painful death".&lt;ref name="Fry"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fry|first=PS|title=Perceived self-efficacy domains as predictors of fear of the unknown and fear of dying among older adults|journal=Psychol Aging|date=September 2003|volume=18|issue=3|pages=474–86|pmid=14518809|doi=10.1037/0882-7974.18.3.474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death anxiety is one's uncertainty to dying. However, there is a more severe form of having a fear of death, which is known as Thanatophobia, which is anxiety over death that becomes debilitating or keeps a person from living their life.{{mcn|date=December 2018}}

The [[Yale]] philosopher [[Shelly Kagan]] examined fear of death in a 2007 Yale open course&lt;ref name="Kagan"&gt;[[Shelly Kagan|Kagan, Shelly]]. [http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-22 Lecture 22: Fear of Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309221733/http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-22 |date=2012-03-09 }} in [http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-1 PHIL 176: Death] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609203506/http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-176/lecture-1 |date=2017-06-09 }}. Yale Open Course 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; by examining the following questions: Is fear of death a reasonable appropriate response? What conditions are required and what are appropriate conditions for feeling fear of death? What is meant by fear, and how much fear is appropriate? According to Kagan for fear in general to make sense, three conditions should be met:
# the object of fear needs to be "something bad"
# there needs to be a non-negligible chance that the bad state of affairs will happen
# there needs to be some uncertainty about the bad state of affairs
The amount of fear should be appropriate to the size of "the bad". If the three conditions are not met, fear is an inappropriate emotion. He argues, that death does not meet the first two criteria, even if death is a "deprivation of good things" and even if one believes in a painful afterlife. Because death is certain, it also does not meet the third criterion, but he grants that the unpredictability of when one dies ''may'' be cause to a sense of fear.&lt;ref name="Kagan" /&gt;

In a 2003 study of 167 women and 121 men, aged 65–87, low [[self-efficacy]] predicted fear of the unknown after death and fear of dying for women and men better than demographics, social support, and physical health. Fear of death was measured by a "Multidimensional Fear of Death Scale" which included the 8 subscales Fear of Dying, Fear of the Dead, Fear of Being Destroyed, Fear for Significant Others, Fear of the Unknown, Fear of Conscious Death, Fear for the Body After Death, and Fear of Premature Death. In [[hierarchical multiple regression]] analysis the most potent predictors of death fears were low "spiritual health efficacy", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to generate spiritually based faith and inner strength, and low "instrumental efficacy", defined as beliefs relating to one's perceived ability to manage activities of daily living.&lt;ref name="Fry"/&gt;

Psychologists have tested the hypotheses that fear of death motivates religious commitment, and that assurances about an afterlife alleviate the fear; however, empirical research on this topic has been equivocal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Religiosity can be related to fear of death when the afterlife is portrayed as time of punishment. "Intrinsic religiosity", as opposed to mere "formal religious involvement", has been found to be negatively correlated with death anxiety.&lt;ref name="Fry"/&gt; In a 1976 study of people of various Christian denominations, those who were most firm in their faith, who attended religious services weekly, were the least afraid of dying. The survey found a negative correlation between fear of death and "religious concern".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/1384409|author=Kahoe, R. D., &amp; Dunn, R.

In a 2006 study of white, Christian men and women the hypothesis was tested that traditional, church-centered religiousness and de-institutionalized spiritual seeking are ways of approaching fear of death in old age. Both religiousness and spirituality were related to positive psychosocial functioning, but only church-centered religiousness protected subjects against the fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1300/J496v18n02_08 | author = Wink, P. | year = 2006 | title = Who is afraid of death?

===Fear of the unknown===
{{See also|Xenophobia|Neophobia}}
Fear of the unknown or '''irrational fear''' is caused by negative thinking ([[worry]]) which arises from [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] accompanied with a subjective sense of apprehension or dread. Irrational fear shares a common neural pathway with other fears, a pathway that engages the nervous system to mobilize bodily resources in the face of danger or threat. Many people are scared of the "unknown". The irrational fear can branch out to many areas such as the hereafter, the next ten years or even tomorrow. Chronic irrational fear has deleterious effects since the elicitor stimulus is commonly absent or perceived from delusions. In these cases specialists use '''F'''alse '''E'''vidence '''A'''ppearing '''R'''eal as a definition, alternatively therapists use it as acronym for '''F'''eeling frightened, '''E'''xpecting bad things to happen, '''A'''ctions and attitudes that can help, and '''R'''ewards and results in Rx programs like [[Coping Cat]]. Such fear can create [[comorbidity]] with the anxiety disorder umbrella.&lt;ref name="BarrettLewis2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lisa Feldman Barrett|author2=Michael Lewis|author3=Jeannette M. Haviland-Jones|title=Handbook of Emotions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bDBqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA751|year=2016|publisher=Guilford Publications|isbn=978-1-4625-2534-8|pages=751–773|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302032508/https://books.google.com/books?id=bDBqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA751|archivedate=2017-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being scared may cause people to experience anticipatory fear of what may lie ahead rather than planning and evaluating for the same. For example, "continuation of scholarly education" is perceived by many educators as a risk that may cause them fear and stress,&lt;ref name=Burton&gt;{{cite journal|author=Burton, L.D.|year=2011|title= Fear|journal=Journal of Research on Christian Education|volume= 20|pages= 113–116|doi=10.1080/10656219.2011.592801|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they would rather teach things they've been taught than go and do research. That can lead to habits such as [[laziness]] and procrastination.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The ambiguity of situations that tend to be uncertain and unpredictable can cause anxiety in addition to other psychological and physical problems in some populations; especially those who engage it constantly, for example, in war-ridden places or in places of conflict, terrorism, abuse, etc. Poor [[parenting]] that instills fear can also debilitate a child's psyche development or personality. For example, parents tell their children not to talk to strangers in order to protect them. In school they would be motivated to not show fear in talking with strangers, but to be assertive and also aware of the risks and the environment in which it takes place. Ambiguous and mixed messages like this can affect their self-esteem and self-confidence. Researchers say talking to strangers isn't something to be thwarted but allowed in a parent's presence if required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fox, E.R.|title=Fear of the unknown|journal=Western Journal of Medicine |volume=7|issue=3|pages=22–25|year=1987|doi=10.1108/17578043200800026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developing  a sense of [[equanimity]] to handle various situations is often advocated as an antidote to irrational fear and as an essential skill by a number of ancient philosophies.

==Mechanism ==
{{anchor|Fear in animals}}
Often laboratory studies with rats are conducted to examine the acquisition and extinction of [[fear conditioning|conditioned fear]] responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Maria|author2=LeDoux, Joseph|title=Differential Contribution of Dorsal and Ventral Medial Prefrontal|journal=Behavioral Neuroscience|year=1995|volume=109|issue=4|pages=681–688|doi=10.1037/0735-7044.109.4.681|pmid=7576212}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, researchers conditioned rats (''Rattus norvegicus'') to fear a certain stimulus, through electric shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cammarota|first=Martín|author2=Bevilaqua, Lia R. M., Kerr, Daniel, Medina, Jorge, H., Izquierdo, Iván|title=Inhibition of mRNA and Protein Synthesis in the CA1 Region of the Dorsal Hippocampus Blocks Reinstallment of an Extinguished Conditioned Fear Response|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=Feb 1, 2003|volume=23|issue=3|pages=737–741|pmid=12574401}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers were able to then cause an extinction of this conditioned fear, to a point that no medications or drugs were able to further aid in the extinction process. However the rats did show signs of avoidance learning, not fear, but simply avoiding the area that brought pain to the test rats. The avoidance learning of rats is seen as a [[conditioned response]], and therefore the behavior can be unconditioned, as supported by the earlier research.

Species-specific defense reactions (SSDRs) or [[avoidance learning]] in nature is the specific tendency to avoid certain threats or stimuli, it is how animals survive in the wild. Humans and animals both share these species-specific defense reactions, such as the flight-or-fight, which also include pseudo-aggression, fake or intimidating aggression and freeze response to threats, which is controlled by the [[sympathetic nervous system]]. These SSDRs are learned very quickly through social interactions between others of the same species, other species, and interaction with the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Stephen|title=21st Century Psychology: A Reference Handbook, Vol. 1|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publication, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=978-1-4129-4968-2|pages=282–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; These acquired sets of reactions or responses are not easily forgotten. The animal that survives is the animal that already knows what to fear and how to avoid this threat. An example in humans is the reaction to the sight of a snake, many jump backwards before cognitively realizing what they are jumping away from, and in some cases it is a stick rather than a snake.

As with many functions of the brain, there are various regions of the brain involved in deciphering fear in humans and other nonhuman species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robert|first=Patrick|title=The Amygdala and Its Allies|url=http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_04/a_04_cr/a_04_cr_peu/a_04_cr_peu.html|website=2002|publisher=The Brain|accessdate=2 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806074559/http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/a/a_04/a_04_cr/a_04_cr_peu/a_04_cr_peu.html|archivedate=6 August 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[amygdala]] communicates both directions between the [[prefrontal cortex]], [[hypothalamus]], the [[sensory cortex]], the [[hippocampus]], [[thalamus]], [[septum]], and the  [[brainstem]]. The amygdala plays an important role in SSDR, such as the ventral amygdalofugal, which is essential for [[associative learning]], and SSDRs are learned through interaction with the environment and others of the same species. An emotional response is created only after the signals have been relayed between the different regions of the brain, and activating the sympathetic nervous systems; which controls the flight, fight, freeze, fright, and faint response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=2489204 | pmid=17880916 | doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2007.08.002 | volume=39 | issue=3 | title=Exploring human freeze responses to a threat stressor | journal=J Behav Ther Exp Psychiatry | pages=292–304 | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = NB | last2 = Richey | first2 = JA | last3 = Zvolensky | first3 = MJ | last4 = Maner | first4 = JK| year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bracha|first=H.S.|journal= CNS Spectr|date=Sep 9, 2004|volume=9|pages=679–685|pmid=15337864|issue=9|title=Freeze, flight, fight, fright, faint: adaptationist perspectives on the acute stress response spectrum|doi=10.1017/s1092852900001954|url=http://cogprints.org/5014/1/2004_C.N.S_Five_Fs_of_FEAR%2D%2DFreeze_Flight_Fight_Fright_Faint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often a damaged amygdala can cause impairment in the recognition of fear (like the human case of [[S.M.

[[Robert C. Bolles]] (1970), a researcher at University of Washington, wanted to understand species-specific defense reactions and avoidance learning among animals, but found that the theories of avoidance learning and the tools that were used to measure this tendency were out of touch with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolles|first=Robert|title=Species-Specific Defense Reactions and Avoidance Learning|journal=Psychological Review|year=1970|volume=77|issue=1|pages=32–48|doi=10.1037/h0028589}}&lt;/ref&gt; He theorized the species-specific defense reaction (SSDR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crawford|first=Mary|author2=Masterson|title=Species-Specific Defense Reactions and Avoidance Learning|journal=The Pavolovian Journal of Biological Science|year=1982|volume=17|issue=5|pages=204–214|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03001275|doi=10.1007/BF03001275|doi-broken-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three forms of SSDRs: flight, fight (pseudo-aggression), or freeze. Even domesticated animals have SSDRs, and in those moments it is seen that animals revert to atavistic standards and become "wild" again. Dr. Bolles states that responses are often dependent on the reinforcement of a safety signal, and not the aversive conditioned stimuli. This safety signal can be a source of feedback or even stimulus change. Intrinsic feedback or information coming from within, muscle twitches, increased heart rate, are seen to be more important in SSDRs than extrinsic feedback, stimuli that comes from the external environment. Dr. Bolles found that most creatures have some intrinsic set of fears, to help assure survival of the species. Rats will run away from any shocking event, and pigeons will flap their wings harder when threatened. The wing flapping in pigeons and the scattered running of rats are considered species-specific defense reactions or behaviors. Bolles believed that SSDRs are conditioned through [[Pavlovian]] conditioning, and not operant conditioning; SSDRs arise from the association between the environmental stimuli and adverse events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kiein|first=Stephen|title=Biological Influences on Learning|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Mississippi State University|url=http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072490462/student_view0/chapter10/chapter_outline.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205080132/http://highered.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/0072490462/student_view0/chapter10/chapter_outline.html|archivedate=2008-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael S.

SSDRs are an evolutionary adaptation that has been seen in many species throughout the world including rats, [[chimpanzee]]s, [[prairie dog]]s, and even [[human]]s, an adaptation created to help individual creatures survive in a hostile world.

* The thalamus collects sensory data from the senses
* Sensory cortex receives data from the thalamus and interprets it
* Sensory cortex organizes information for dissemination to the hypothalamus (fight or flight), amygdalae (fear), hippocampus (memory)

The brain structures that are the center of most neurobiological events associated with fear are the two [[amygdalae]], located behind the pituitary gland. Each amygdala is part of a circuitry of fear learning.&lt;ref name=Olsson/&gt; They are essential for proper adaptation to stress and specific modulation of emotional learning memory. In the presence of a threatening stimulus, the amygdalae generate the secretion of hormones that influence fear and aggression.&lt;ref&gt;Best, Ben (2004). [http://www.benbest.com/science/anatmind/anatmd9.html The Amygdala and the Emotions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309132748/http://www.benbest.com/science/anatmind/anatmd9.html |date=2007-03-09 }}. benbest.com&lt;/ref&gt; Once a response to the stimulus in the form of fear or aggression commences, the amygdalae may elicit the release of hormones into the body to put the person into a state of alertness, in which they are ready to move, run, fight, etc. This defensive response is generally referred to in physiology as the [[fight-or-flight response]] regulated by the hypothalamus, part of the [[limbic system]].&lt;ref&gt;Gleitman, Henry; Fridlund, Alan J. and Reisberg, Daniel (2004).

Pathogens can suppress amygdala activity. Rats infected with the [[toxoplasmosis]] parasite become less fearful of cats, sometimes even seeking out their urine-marked areas. This behavior often leads to them being eaten by cats. The parasite then reproduces within the body of the cat. There is evidence that the parasite concentrates itself in the amygdala of infected rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

====Pheromones and why fear can be contagious====
In threatening situations insects, aquatic organisms, birds, reptiles, and mammals emit odorant substances, initially called alarm substances, which are chemical signals now called alarm [[pheromones]] ("Schreckstoff" in German). This is to defend themselves and at the same time to inform members of the same species of danger and leads to observable behavior change like freezing, defensive behavior, or dispersion depending on circumstances and species. For example, stressed rats release odorant cues that cause other rats to move away from the source of the signal.

After the discovery of pheromones in 1959, alarm pheromones were first described in 1968 in ants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moser | first1 = JC | last2 = Brownlee | first2 = RC | last3 = Silverstein | first3 = R | date = Apr 1968 | title = Alarm pheromones of the ant atta texana |journal = J Insect Physiol | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 529–35 | doi=10.1016/0022-1910(68)90068-1| pmid = 5649232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and earthworms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ressler | first1 = RH | last2 = Cialdini | first2 = RB | last3 = Ghoca | first3 = ML | last4 = Kleist | first4 = SM | year = 1968 | title = Alarm pheromone in the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris |journal = Science | volume = 161 | issue = 3841| pages = 597–9 | doi=10.1126/science.161.3841.597| pmid = 5663305 |bibcode = 1968Sci...161..597R }}&lt;/ref&gt; and four years later also found in mammals, both mice and rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rottman | first1 = SJ | last2 = Snowdon | first2 = CT | date = Dec 1972 | title = Demonstration and analysis of an alarm pheromone in mice |journal = J Comp Physiol Psychol | volume = 81 | issue = 3| pages = 483–90 | doi=10.1037/h0033703| pmid = 4649187 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two decades identification and characterization of these pheromones proceeded in all manner of insects and sea animals, including fish, but it was not until 1990 that more insight into mammalian alarm pheromones was gleaned.

Earlier, in 1985, a link between odors released by stressed rats and [[pain perception]] was discovered: unstressed rats exposed to these odors developed opioid-mediated analgesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fanselow | first1 = MS | year = 1985|pmid=3843728| title = Odors released by stressed rats produce opioid analgesia in unstressed rats |journal = Behav. Neurosci | volume = 99| issue = 3 | pages = 589–592 | doi=10.1037/0735-7044.99.3.589}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, researchers found that bees became less responsive to pain after they had been stimulated with [[isoamyl acetate]], a chemical smelling of banana, and a component of bee alarm pheromone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Núñez J|title=Alarm pheromone induces stress analgesia via an opioid system in the honeybee|pmid=9402618|journal= Physiol. Behav.|year= 1997 |volume=63|issue=1|pages=75–80|doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(97)00391-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment also showed that the bees' fear-induced [[pain tolerance]] was mediated by an [[endorphine]].

By using the [[Behavioural despair test|forced swimming test]] in rats as a model of fear-induction, the first mammalian "alarm substance" was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = EL | last2 = Bilitzke | first2 = PJ | date = Aug 1990 | title = A possible alarm substance in the forced swimming test |journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 233–9 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(90)90306-o| pmid = 2255725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, this "alarm substance" was shown to fulfill criteria for pheromones: well-defined behavioral effect, species specificity, minimal influence of experience and control for nonspecific arousal. Rat activity testing with the alarm pheromone, and their preference/avoidance for odors from cylinders containing the pheromone, showed that the pheromone had very low [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = EL | date = Oct 1991 | title = Alarm substance emitted by rats in the forced-swim test is a low volatile pheromone |journal = Physiol Behav | volume = 50 | issue = 4| pages = 723–7 | doi=10.1016/0031-9384(91)90009-d| pmid = 1775546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 a connection between alarm chemosignals in mice and their [[immune system|immune response]] was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cocke | first1 = R | last2 = Moynihan | first2 = JA | last3 = Cohen | first3 = N | last4 = Grota | first4 = LJ | last5 = Ader | first5 = R | date = Mar 1993 | title = Exposure to conspecific alarm chemosignals alters immune responses in BALB/c mice |journal = Brain Behav Immun | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 36–46 | doi=10.1006/brbi.1993.1004| pmid = 8471798 | title-link = BALB/c mice }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pheromone production in mice was found to be associated with or mediated by the [[pituitary gland]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Abel | first1 = EL | date = Jun 1994 | title = The pituitary mediates production or release of an alarm chemosignal in rats |journal = Horm Behav | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 139–45 | doi=10.1006/hbeh.1994.1011| pmid = 7927280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, it was demonstrated that rats' alarm pheromones had different effects on the "recipient" rat (the rat perceiving the pheromone) depending which body region they were released from: Pheromone production from the face modified behavior in the recipient rat, e.g. caused sniffing or movement, whereas pheromone secreted from the rat's anal area induced [[autonomic nervous system]] stress responses, like an increase in core body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiyokawa Y|title=Alarm pheromones with different functions are released from different regions of the body surface of male rats|journal=Chem Senses|year=2004|volume=29|issue=1|pages=35–40|pmid=14752038|doi=10.1093/chemse/bjh004|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831175230/|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further experiments showed that when a rat perceived alarm pheromones, it increased its defensive and risk assessment behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiyokawa Y|title=Alarm pheromone increases defensive and risk assessment behaviors in male rats|journal=Physiol. Behav.|year=2006|volume=87|issue=2|pages=383–7|pmid=16337975|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.11.003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830233838/|archivedate=2017-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its acoustic [[startle reflex]] was enhanced.

It was not until 2011 that a link between severe pain, neuroinflammation and alarm pheromones release in rats was found: real time [[RT-PCR]] analysis of rat brain tissues indicated that shocking the footpad of a rat increased its production of [[proinflammatory cytokines]] in deep brain structures, namely of [[IL-1β]], heteronuclear [[Corticotropin-releasing hormone]] and [[c-fos]] mRNA expressions in both the [[paraventricular nucleus]] and the bed nucleus of the [[stria terminalis]], and it increased stress hormone levels in plasma ([[corticosterone]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Arakawa H|title=The role of neuroinflammation in the release of aversive odor cues from footshock-stressed rats: Implications for the neural mechanism of alarm pheromones|pmid=20888127|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|year= 2011 |volume=36|issue=4|pages=557–68|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[emotion#neurocircuitry|neurocircuit]] for how rats perceive alarm pheromones was shown to be related to the [[hypothalamus]], [[brainstem]], and [[amygdala]]e, all of which are evolutionary ancient structures deep inside or in the case of the brainstem underneath the brain away from the cortex, and involved in the [[fight-or-flight response]], as is the case in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiyokawa Y|title=Mapping the neural circuit activated by alarm pheromone perception by c-Fos immunohistochemistry|journal=Brain Res.|year=2005|volume=1043|issue=1–2|pages=145–54|pmid=15862528|doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2005.02.061|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831131924/|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alarm pheromone-induced anxiety in rats has been used to evaluate the degree to which [[anxiolytic]]s can alleviate anxiety in humans. For this the change in the [[startle response#acoustic startle reflex|acoustic startle reflex]] of rats with alarm pheromone-induced anxiety (i.e. reduction of defensiveness) has been measured. Pretreatment of rats with one of five anxiolytics used in clinical medicine was able to reduce their anxiety: namely [[midazolam]], [[phenelzine]] (a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor), [[propranolol]], a nonselective [[beta blocker]], [[clonidine]], an [[alpha-2 adrenergic receptor#agonist|alpha 2 adrenergic agonist]] or [[CP-154,526]], a [[corticotropin-releasing hormone antagonist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Inagaki H|title=The alarm pheromone in male rats as a unique anxiety model: psychopharmacological evidence using anxiolytics|journal= Pharmacol Biochem Behav|year= 2010 |volume=94|issue=4|pages=575–9|pmid=19969015|doi=10.1016/j.pbb.2009.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faulty development of odor discrimination impairs the [[perception]] of pheromones and pheromone-related behavior, like [[aggression|aggressive behavior]] and mating in male rats: The enzyme [[MAPK7|Mitogen-activated protein kinase 7]] (MAPK7) has been implicated in regulating the development of the olfactory bulb and odor discrimination and it is highly expressed in developing rat brains, but absent in most regions of adult rat brains. [[Conditional gene knockout|Conditional deletion]] of the MAPK7gene in mouse neural stem cells impairs several pheromone-mediated behaviors, including aggression and mating in male mice. These behavior impairments were not caused by a reduction in the level of testosterone, by physical immobility, by heightened fear or anxiety or by depression. Using mouse urine as a natural pheromone-containing solution, it has been shown that the impairment was associated with defective detection of related pheromones, and with changes in their inborn preference for pheromones related to sexual and reproductive activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zou J|title= Conditional deletion of ERK5 MAP kinase in the nervous system impairs pheromone information processing and pheromone-evoked behaviors|journal= PLoS ONE|year= 2013 |volume=8|issue=10|pages=e76901|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0076901|pmid= 24130808|pmc= 3793934|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...876901Z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, alleviation of an acute fear response because a friendly peer (or in biological language: an affiliative [[conspecific]]) [[tend and befriend|tends and befriends]] is called "social buffering". The term is in analogy to the 1985 "buffering" hypothesis in psychology, where [[social support]] has been proven to mitigate the negative health effects of alarm pheromone mediated distress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.98.2.310 |title=Stress, social support, and the buffering hypothesis |year=1985 |last1=Cohen |first1=Sheldon |last2=Wills |first2=Thomas A. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=98 |issue=2 |pages=310–57 |pmid=3901065}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of a "social pheromone" is suggested by the recent discovery that olfactory signals are responsible in mediating the "social buffering" in male rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Yuji|last1=Takahashi|first2=Yasushi|last2=Kiyokawa|first3=Yuka|last3=Kodama|first4=Sayaka|last4=Arata|title=Olfactory signals mediate social buffering of conditioned fear responses in male rats|journal=Behavioural Brain Research|pages=46–51|volume=240|doi=10.1016/j.bbr.2012.11.017|pmid=23183219|first5=Yukari|last5=Takeuchi|first6=Yuji|last6=Mori|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831133047/|archivedate=2017-08-31|df=|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Social buffering" was also observed to mitigate the conditioned fear responses of honeybees.  A bee colony exposed to an environment of high threat of predation did not show increased aggression and aggressive-like gene expression patterns in individual bees, but decreased aggression. That the bees did not simply [[habituation|habituate]] to threats is suggested by the fact that the disturbed colonies also decreased their foraging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rittschof CC|author2= Robinson GE|title= Manipulation of colony environment modulates honey bee aggression and brain gene expression|journal= Genes Brain Behav|year= 2013 |volume=12|issue=8|pages=802–11|doi=10.1111/gbb.12087|pmid= 24034579|pmc=3863782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists have proposed in 2012 that fear pheromones evolved as molecules of "keystone significance", a term coined in analogy to [[keystone species]]. Pheromones may determine [[species richness|species compositions]] and affect rates of energy and material exchange in an [[community(ecology)|ecological community]]. Thus pheromones generate structure in a [[food web]] and play critical roles in maintaining [[Ecosystem health|natural system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ferrer RP|author2=Zimmer RK|pmid=23111129|title=Community ecology and the evolution of molecules of keystone significance|journal= Biol Bull|year= 2012 |volume=223|issue=2|pages=167–77|doi=10.1086/BBLv223n2p167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fear pheromones in humans====
Evidence of chemosensory alarm signals in humans has emerged slowly: Although alarm pheromones have not been physically isolated and their chemical structures have not been identified in humans so far, there is evidence for their presence. [[Androstadienone]], for example, a steroidal, endogenous odorant, is a pheromone candidate found in human sweat, axillary hair and plasma. The closely related compound [[androstenone]] is involved in communicating dominance, aggression or competition; sex hormone influences on androstenone perception in humans showed a high testosterone level related to heightened androstenone sensitivity in men, a high testosterone level related to [[unhappiness]] in response to androstenone in men, and a high estradiol level related to disliking of androstenone in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lübke KT|author2= Pause BM|title=Sex-hormone dependent perception of androstenone suggests its involvement in communicating competition and aggression|journal= Physiol Behav|year= 2014|volume=123|pages=136–41|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2013.10.016|pmid= 24184511}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A German study from 2006 showed when anxiety-induced versus exercise-induced human sweat from a dozen people was pooled and offered to seven study participants, of five able to olfactorily distinguish exercise-induced sweat from room air, three could also distinguish exercise-induced sweat from anxiety induced sweat. The [[startle reflex|acoustic startle reflex]] response to a sound when sensing anxiety sweat was larger than when sensing exercise-induced sweat, as measured by [[electromyograph]] analysis of the orbital muscle, which is responsible for the eyeblink component. This showed for the first time that fear chemosignals can modulate the startle reflex in humans without emotional mediation; fear chemosignals primed the recipient's "defensive behavior" prior to the subjects' conscious attention on the acoustic startle reflex level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prehn | first1 = A | last2 = Ohrt | first2 = A | last3 = Sojka | first3 = B | last4 = Ferstl | first4 = R | last5 = Pause | first5 = BM | year = 2006 | title = Chemosensory anxiety signals augment the startle reflex in humans |journal = Neurosci.

In analogy to the social buffering of rats and honeybees in response to chemosignals, induction of [[empathy]] by "smelling anxiety" of another person has been found in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prehn-Kristensen | first1 = A. | last2 = Wiesner | first2 = C. | last3 = Bergmann | first3 = T.O. | last4 = Wolff | first4 = S. | last5 = Jansen | first5 = O. | last6 = Mehdorn | first6 = H.M. | year = 2009 | title = Induction of empathy by the smell of anxiety |journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 6| page = e5987 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0005987| author7 = and others | displayauthors = 6 | last8 = Pause | first8 = Bettina M. | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5987P | pmid=19551135 | pmc=2695008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2013 provided brain imaging evidence that human responses to fear chemosignals may be [[gender-specific]]. Researchers collected alarm-induced sweat and exercise-induced sweat from donors extracted it, pooled it and presented it to 16 unrelated people undergoing functional brain [[MRI]]. While stress-induced sweat from males produced a comparably strong emotional response in both females and males, stress-induced sweat from females produced a markedly stronger arousal in women than in men. Statistical tests pinpointed this gender-specificity to the right amygdala and strongest in the superficial nuclei. Since no significant differences were found in the [[olfactory bulb]], the response to female fear-induced signals is likely based on processing the meaning, i.e. on the emotional level, rather than the strength of chemosensory cues from each gender, i.e. the perceptual level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radulescu | first1 = AR | last2 = Mujica-Parodi | first2 = LR | date = Jul 2013 | title = Human gender differences in the perception of conspecific alarm chemosensory cues |journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 7| page = e68485 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068485|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...868485R | pmid=23894310 | pmc=3722227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[approach–avoidance conflict|approach-avoidance task]] was set up where volunteers seeing either an angry or a happy cartoon face on a computer screen pushed away or pulled toward them a joystick as fast as possible. Volunteers smelling anandrostadienone, masked with clove oil scent responded faster, especially to angry faces, than those smelling clove oil only, which was interpreted as anandrostadienone-related activation of the fear system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Frey MC|title=Androstadienone in motor reactions of men and women toward angry faces|journal= Percept Mot Skills|year= 2012 |volume=114|issue=3|pages=807–25|pmid=22913022|doi=10.2466/07.16.22.28.PMS.114.3.807-825}}&lt;/ref&gt; A potential mechanism of action is, that [[androstadienone]] alters the "emotional face processing". Androstadienone is known to influence activity of the [[fusiform gyrus]] which is relevant for [[face perception|face recognition]].

==Management==

===Pharmaceutical===
A drug treatment for fear conditioning and phobias via the amygdalae is the use of [[glucocorticoid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sandi | first1 = C. | title = Healing anxiety disorders with glucocorticoids | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1103410108 | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 108 | issue = 16 | pages = 6343–6344 | year = 2011 | pmid =  21482789| pmc = 3080972|bibcode = 2011PNAS..108.6343S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, glucocorticoid receptors in the central nuclei of the amygdalae were disrupted in order to better understand the mechanisms of fear and fear conditioning. The glucocorticoid receptors were inhibited using lentiviral vectors containing Cre-recombinase injected into mice. Results showed that disruption of the glucocorticoid receptors prevented conditioned fear behavior. The mice were subjected to auditory cues which caused them to freeze normally. However, a reduction of freezing was observed in the mice that had inhibited glucocorticoid receptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Psychology ===
[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] has been successful in helping people overcome their fear. Because fear is more complex than just forgetting or deleting [[memory|memories]], an active and successful approach involves people repeatedly confronting their fears. By confronting their fears in a safe manner a person can suppress the "fear-triggering memories" or stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=J. S. |last2=Tolin |first2=D. F. |year=2011 |title=Exposure therapy for anxiety disorders: Theoretical mechanisms of exposure and treatment strategies |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/894207776 |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=28 |issue=9 |pages=33–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Exposure therapy]] has known to have helped up to 90% of people with specific [[phobias]] to significantly decrease their fear over time.&lt;ref name=Travis&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Travis | first1 = John  | year = 2004 | title = Fear not: Scientists are learning how people can unlearn fear | journal = Science News | volume = 165 | issue = 3 | pages = 42–44 | jstor =  4014925| doi = 10.2307/4014925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; 

Another psychological treatment is systematic desensitization, which is a type of behavior therapy used to completely remove the fear or produce a disgusted response to this fear and replace it. The replacement that occurs will be relaxation and will occur through conditioning. Through conditioning treatments, muscle tensioning will lessen and deep breathing techniques will aid in de-tensioning. 

=== '''Other Treatments''' ===
Other methods for treating or coping with one's fear was suggested by life coach Robin Sharma. A person could keep a journal in which they write down rational thoughts regarding their fears. Journal entries are a healthy method of expressing one's fears without compromising their safety or causing uncertainty. Another suggestion is a fear ladder. To create a fear ladder, one must write down all of their fears and score them on a scale of one to ten. Next, the person addresses their phobia, starting with the lowest number. 

Finding solace in religion is another method to cope with one's fear. Having something to answer your questions regarding your fears, such as, what happens after death or if there is an afterlife, can help mitigate one's fear of death because there is no room for uncertainty as their questions are answered. Religion offers a method of being able to understand and make sense of one's fears rather than ignore them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fearof.net/cure-your-fear-phobia-treatment/|title=Cure Your Fear - Phobia Treatment|work=FearOf.net|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
[[File:Guido Reni - Massacre of the Innocents detail3 - Pinacoteca Nazionale Bologna.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Guido Reni]] c. 1611]]

=== Death ===

The fear of the end of life and its existence is in other words the fear of death. The fear of death ritualized the lives of our ancestors. These rituals were designed to reduce that fear; they helped collect the cultural ideas that we now have in the present.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} These rituals also helped preserve the cultural ideas. The results and methods of human existence had been changing at the same time that social formation was changing. One can say{{by whom|date=October 2016}} that the formation of communities happened because people lived in fear. The result of this fear forced people to unite to fight dangers together rather than fight alone.

When people are faced with their own thoughts of death, they either accept that they are dying or will die because they have lived a full life or they will experience fear. A theory was developed in response to this, which is called the Terror Management Theory. The theory states that a person's cultural worldviews (religion, values, etc.) will mitigate the terror associated with the fear of death through avoidance. To help manage their terror, they find solace in their death-denying beliefs, such as their religion. Another way people cope with their death related fears is pushing any thoughts of death into the future or by avoiding these thoughts all together through distractions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldenberg|first=Jamie L.|last2=Pyszczynski|first2=Tom|last3=Greenberg|first3=Jeff|last4=Solomon|first4=Sheldon|date=August 2000|title=Fleeing the Body: A Terror Management Perspective on the Problem of Human Corporeality|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0403_1|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|volume=4|issue=3|pages=200–218|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0403_1|issn=1088-8683}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are methods for one coping with the terror associated with their fear of death, not everyone suffers from these same uncertainties. People who have lived a full life, typically do not fear death because they believe that they have lived their life to the fullest.

=== Religion ===
{{See also|Fear of God|Religious paranoia|Category:Religion and death}}
Religions are filled with different fears that humans have had throughout many centuries. The fears aren't just metaphysical (including the problems of life and death) but are also moral. Death is seen as a boundary to another world. That world would always be different depending on how each individual lived their lives. The origins of this intangible fear are not found in the present world. In a sense we can assume that fear was a big influence on things such as morality. This assumption, however, flies in the face of concepts such as [[moral absolutism]] and [[moral universalism]] – which would hold that our morals are rooted in either the divine or natural laws of the universe, and would not be generated by any human feeling, thought or emotion. 

From a theological perspective, the word "fear" encompasses more than simple fear. Robert B. Strimple says that fear includes the ". . . convergence of awe, reverence, adoration. . .".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opc.org/new_horizons/NH01/03a.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Some translations of the Bible, such as the New International Version, sometimes replace the word "fear" with "reverence".

Fear in religion can be seen throughout the years, however, the most prominent example would be The Crusades. Pope Urban II allowed for Christian mercenary troops to be sent on a mission in order to recover the Holy Lands from the Muslims. However, the message was misinterpreted and as a result, innocent people were slaughtered. Although the Crusades were meant to stay between the Muslims and the Christians, the hate spread onto the Jewish culture. Jewish people who feared for their lives, gave into the forced conversion of Christianity because they believed this would secure their safety. Other Jewish people feared betraying their God by conceding to a conversion, and instead, secured their own fate, which was death. It can also be argued that Christians feared their religion not being the primary religion, and this is why they committed mass murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-crusades/|title=How the Crusades Affected Medieval Jews in Europe and Palestine {{!}} My Jewish Learning|work=My Jewish Learning|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manipulation ===
{{Further|Culture of fear|Fear mongering|Fear appeal|Psychological warfare|Tactics of terrorism#Fear|List of causes of death by rate}}
Fear may be politically and culturally manipulated to persuade citizenry of ideas which would otherwise be widely rejected or dissuade citizenry from ideas which would otherwise be widely supported. In contexts of disasters, nation-states manage the fear not only to provide their citizens with an explanation about the event or blaming some minorities, but also to adjust their previous beliefs. 

Fear can alter how a person thinks or reacts to situations because fear has the power to inhibit one's rational way of thinking. As a result, people who do not experience fear, are able to use fear as a tool to manipulate others. People who are experiencing fear, seek preservation through safety and can be manipulated by a person who is there to provide that safety that is being sought after. "When we're afraid, a manipulator can talk us out of the truth we see right in front of us. Words become more real than reality" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psychopathsandlove.com/fear-and-manipulation/|title=Fear and Manipulation: Perfect Together {{!}} Psychopaths and Love|website=psychopathsandlove.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this, a manipulator is able to use our fear to manipulate us out the truth and instead make us believe and trust in their truth. Politicians are notorious for using fear to manipulate the people into supporting their will. Through keywords and key phrases such as, "it is for your safety," or "it is for the safety of this country," politicians invoke fear within people that their safety is at stake, and people will ultimately follow in line in order for their safety to be restored. 

=== Fiction and mythology ===
{{See also|Dystopia#In society|Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction#In society}}
Fear is found and reflected in [[mythology]] and folklore as well as in works of [[fiction]] such as novels and films.

Works of dystopian and (post)apocalyptic fiction convey the fears and anxieties of societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dystopia facts, information, pictures|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/literature-english/english-literature-20th-cent-present/dystopia|website=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170304114045/http://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/literature-english/english-literature-20th-cent-present/dystopia|archivedate=4 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fever"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kyle|first1=Richard G.|title=Apocalyptic Fever: End-Time Prophecies in Modern America|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=9781621894100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1dJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=3 March 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225222128/https://books.google.com/books?id=p1dJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185|archivedate=25 December 2017|df=|date=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such might constructively provoke discussion and steps to be taken to prevent depicted [[global catastrophic risk|catastrophes]].

''[[The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was]]'' is a German fairy tale dealing with the topic of not knowing fear.
Many stories also include characters who fear the antagonist of the plot. One important characteristic of historical and mythical [[hero]]es across cultures is to be fearless in the face of big and often lethal enemies.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

=== Athletics ===
In the world of athletics fear is often used as a means of motivation to not fail.&lt;ref name="Conroy, D.E. 2001"&gt;Conroy, D.E., Poczwardowski, A. and Henschen, K.P. (2001). Evaluative criteria and consequences associated with failure and success for elite athletes and performing artists. Journal of Applied Sport Psychology, 13, 300/322.&lt;/ref&gt; This situation involves using fear in a way that increases the chances of a positive outcome. In this case the fear that is being created is initially a cognitive state to the receiver.&lt;ref name="Lazarus, R.S. 1991"&gt;Lazarus, R.S. (1991). Emotion and Adaptation. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; This initial state is what generates the first response of the athlete, this response generates a possibility of fight or flight reaction by the athlete (receiver), which in turn will increase or decrease the possibility of success or failure in the certain situation for the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Birney, R. C., Burdick, H., &amp; Teevan, R. C. (1969). ''Fear of failure''. Van Nostrand-Reinhold Company.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of time that the athlete has to determine this decision is small but it is still enough time for the receiver to make a determination through cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, R. S. (1991). Emotion and adaptation. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the decision is made quickly, the decision is determined through past events that have been experienced by the athlete.&lt;ref&gt;Duda, J. L. (1993). Goals: A social-cognitive approach to the study of achievement motivation in sport. In R. N. Singer, M. Murphey, &amp; L. K. Tennant (Eds.), Handbook of research on sport psychology (pp. 421–436). New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of these past events will determine how the athlete will make his cognitive decision in the spilt second that he or she has.&lt;ref name="Conroy, D.E. 2001"/&gt;

Fear of failure as described above has been studied frequently in the field of sport psychology. Many scholars have tried to determine how often fear of failure is triggered within athletes. As well as what personalities of athletes most often choose to use this type of motivation. Studies have also been conducted to determine the success rate of this method of motivation.

Murray's Exploration in Personal (1938) was one of the first studies that actually identified fear of failure as an actual motive to avoid failure or to achieve success. His studies suggested that inavoidance, the need to avoid failure, was found in many college-aged men during the time of his research in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, H. (1938). Explorations in Personal. Oxford University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;  This was a monumental finding in the field of psychology because it allowed other researchers to better clarify how fear of failure can actually be a determinant of creating achievement goals as well as how it could be used in the actual act of achievement.&lt;ref name="Conroy, D. E. 2004"&gt;Conroy, D. E., &amp; Elliot, A. J. (2004). Fear of failure and achievement goals in sport: Addressing the issue of the chicken and the egg. ''Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping,'' ''17''(3), 271-285. doi:10.1080/1061580042000191642&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of sport, a model was created by R.S. Lazarus in 1991 that uses the cognitive-motivational-relational theory of emotion.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarus, R.S. (1991). Emotion and Adaptation. Oxford University Press, New York:&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|It holds that Fear of Failure results when beliefs or cognitive schemas about aversive consequences of failing are activated by situations in which failure is possible. These belief systems predispose the individual to make appraisals of threat and experience the state anxiety that is associated with Fear of Failure in evaluative situations.&lt;ref name="Conroy, D. E. 2004"&gt;Conroy, D. E., &amp; Elliot, A. J. (2004). Fear of failure and achievement goals in sport: Addressing the issue of the chicken and the egg. ''Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping,'' ''17''(3), 271-285. doi:10.1080/1061580042000191642&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lazarus, R.S. 1991"&gt;Lazarus, R.S. (1991). Emotion and Adaptation. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another study was done in 2001 by Conroy, Poczwardowski, and Henschen that created five aversive consequences of failing that have been repeated over time. The five categories include (a) experiencing shame and embarrassment, (b) devaluing one's self-estimate, (c) having an uncertain future, (d) important others losing interest, (e) upsetting important others.&lt;ref name="Conroy, D.E. 2001"/&gt; These five categories can help one infer the possibility of an individual to associate failure with one of these threat categories, which will lead them to experiencing fear of failure.

In summary, the two studies that were done above created a more precise definition of fear of failure, which is "a dispositional tendency to experience apprehension and anxiety in evaluative situations because individuals have learned that failure is associated with aversive consequences".&lt;ref name="Conroy, D. E. 2004"&gt;Conroy, D. E., &amp; Elliot, A. J. (2004). Fear of failure and achievement goals in sport: Addressing the issue of the chicken and the egg. ''Anxiety, Stress &amp; Coping,'' ''17''(3), 271-285. doi:10.1080/1061580042000191642&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inability to Experience Fear==

People who have damage to their [[amygdala]]e, which can be caused by a rare genetic disease known as [[Urbach–Wiethe disease]], are unable to experience fear. The disease destroys both amygdalae in late childhood. Since the discovery of the disease, there have only been 400 recorded cases. This is not debilitating; however, a lack of fear can allow someone to get into a dangerous situation they otherwise would have avoided. For example, people who possess a lack of fear would approach a known venomous snake while those who possess fear, would typically try to avoid it. Fear is an important aspect of a human being's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/01/16/377517810/world-with-no-fear|date=2015-01-16|accessdate=2015-01-27|title=World With No Fear|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150127000942/http://www.npr.org/2015/01/16/377517810/world-with-no-fear|archivedate=2015-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility of a lack of fear could be Antisocial Personality Disorder or more commonly known as sociopathy, which is a mental health condition where people often manipulate others. People who suffer from this disorder lack a physiological response and are capable of lying or not experiencing fear. When a person is approached by something they fear or has a phobia, the body will react in a way that conveys this fear. For example, a person who possesses Arachnophobia, or a fear of spiders, would experience a physical response such as, nausea, dizziness, or even shaking when approached by a spider. However, a person with Antisocial Personality Disorder lacks this capability and would not activate their "fight or flight" response to such fear. They also disregard the safety of others and will often put them at harm or in the way of harm. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalhealth.gov/what-to-look-for/personality-disorders/antisocial-personality-disorder|title=Antisocial Personality Disorder {{!}} MentalHealth.gov|website=www.mentalhealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filial responsibility laws'''  ('''filial support laws''', '''filial piety laws''') are laws in the [[United States]] that impose a duty upon third parties, usually (but not always) adult children for the support of their impoverished parents or other relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Paying for Mom: Little-Known Laws Force Families to Fund Parents’ Care|publisher=American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)|url=http://www.aarp.org/relationships/caregiving/info-01-2009/paying_for_momlittle_known_laws_force_families_to_fund_parents_care_.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231062247/http://www.aarp.org/relationships/caregiving/info-01-2009/paying_for_momlittle_known_laws_force_families_to_fund_parents_care_.html|archivedate=31 December 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases the duty is extended to other relatives. Such laws may be enforced by governmental or private entities and may be at the state or national level.  While most filial responsibility laws contemplate civil enforcement, some include criminal penalties for adult children or close relatives who fail to provide for family members when challenged to do so.  The key concept is ''impoverished'', as there is no requirement that the parent be aged.  For non-Western societies, the term "filial piety" has been applied to family responsibilities toward elders.
  
A “filial responsibility law” is not the same thing as the provision in United States federal law which requires a [[Medicaid#Five year "look-back"|“lookback” of five years]] in the financial records of anyone applying for [[Medicaid]] to ensure that the person did not give away assets in order to qualify for Medicaid.

==History==
Filial support laws were an outgrowth of the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601|Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lopes, James L.|year=1975 |title=Filial Support and Family Solidarity|journal=Pacific Law Journal|volume=6|pages=508&amp;ndash;535|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mcglr6&amp;div=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Callahan, Daniel|year=1985 |title=What do children owe elderly parents?|journal=The Hastings Center Report|volume=15|issue=2|pages=32&amp;ndash;37, page 33|doi=10.2307/3560643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, as many as 45 U.S. states had statutes obligating an adult child to care for his or her parents. Some states repealed their filial support laws after Medicaid took a greater role in providing relief to elderly patients without means. Other states did not, and a large number of filial support laws remain dormant on the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/northwesternmutual/2014/02/03/who-will-pay-for-moms-or-dads-nursing-home-bill-filial-support-laws-and-long-term-care/|title=Northwestern MutualVoice: Who Will Pay For Mom's Or Dad's Nursing Home Bill? Filial Support Laws And Long-Term Care|first=Northwestern MutualVoice|last=Team|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Generally, the media has not covered filial responsibility laws much, and there has not been the political will to see that they are enforced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Callahan|1985|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2012, twenty-nine states&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Katherine, [http://elibrary.law.psu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&amp;context=fac_works Family (filial) responsibility/support statutes in the United States], [[Penn State University, Dickinson School of Law]], 5 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Who pays for nursing home care?|publisher=American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)|url=http://www.aarp.org/politics-society/rights/info-09-2011/who-pays-nursing-home-costs-interactive-map.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; have such laws on the books, and a few states require the potential support of grandparents or even siblings.

==Support required==
Typically, these laws obligate adult children (or depending on the state, other family members) to pay for their indigent parents’/relatives' food, clothing, shelter and medical needs. Should the children fail to provide adequately, they allow nursing homes and government agencies to bring legal action to recover the cost of caring for the parents.  Adult children can even go to jail in some states if they fail to provide filial support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.aarp.org/2013/10/28/more-filial-support-cases-ending-up-in-court/|title=More Filial Support Cases Ending Up in Court|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the media reported the case of John Pittas, whose mother had received care in a skilled nursing facility in Pennsylvania after an accident and then moved to Greece. The nursing home sued her son directly, before even trying to collect from Medicaid. A court in Pennsylvania ruled that the son must pay, according to the Pennsylvania filial responsibility law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Weston, Liz|date=18 July 2012|title=Will you get Dad's nursing-home bill?|publisher=MSN Money|url=http://money.msn.com/retirement-plan/will-you-get-dads-nursing-home-bill-weston.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721171346/http://money.msn.com/retirement-plan/will-you-get-dads-nursing-home-bill-weston.aspx|archivedate=21 July 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in ref|date=September 2017}}

Consequently, the collective genomes of the holobiont form a "hologenome". Holobionts and hologenomes are structural entities&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; that replace misnomers in the context of host-microbiota symbioses such as [[superorganism]] (i.e., an integrated social unit composed of conspecifics), organ, and [[metagenome]]. Variation in the hologenome may encode phenotypic plasticity of the holobiont and can be subject to evolutionary changes caused by selection and drift, if portions of the hologenome are transmitted between generations with reasonable fidelity. One of the important outcomes of recasting the individual as a holobiont subject to evolutionary forces is that genetic variation in the hologenome can be brought about by changes in the host genome and also by changes in the microbiome, including new acquisitions of microbes, horizontal gene transfers, and changes in microbial abundance within hosts. Although there is a rich literature on binary host–microbe symbioses, the hologenome concept distinguishes itself by including the vast symbiotic complexity inherent in many multicellular hosts. For recent literature on holobionts and hologenomes published in an open access platform, see the following reference.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Origin==

[[Lynn Margulis]] coined the term holobiont in her 1991 book ''Symbiosis as a Source of Evolutionary Innovation: Specation and Morphogenesis'' (MIT Press).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3sKzeiHUIUQC |title=Symbiosis as a Source of Evolutionary Innovation: Speciation and Morphogenesis |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |last2=Fester |first2=René |date=1991-01-01 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262132695}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term holobiont is derived from the Ancient Greek [[wikt:ὅλος |ὅλος]] (hólos, "whole"), and the word biont for a unit of life.

In September 1994, [[Richard Anthony Jefferson |Richard Jefferson]] first introduced the term hologenome at a presentation at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Number 6 in a series of 7 VHS recordings, ''A Decade of PCR: Celebrating 10 Years of Amplification'', Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1994. {{ISBN |0-87969-473-4}}. http://www.cshlpress.com/default.tpl?..&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgL3rmZL9P0 Part 4: The Hologenome - YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; At the CSH Symposium and earlier, the unsettling number and diversity of microbes that were being discovered through the powerful tool of PCR-amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA genes was exciting, but confusing interpretations in diverse studies. A number of speakers referred to microbial contributions to mammalian or plant DNA samples as 'contamination'. In his lecture, Jefferson argued that these were likely not contamination, but rather essential components of the samples that reflected the actual genetic composition of the organism being studied, and that the logic of the organism's performance and capabilities would be embedded only in the hologenome. Observations on the ubiquity of microbes in plant and soil samples as well as laboratory work on molecular genetics of vertebrate-associated microbial enzymes informed this assertion {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

In 2008, [[Eugene Rosenberg]] and Ilana Zilber-Rosenberg independently derived the term hologenome and developed the hologenome theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Zilber-Rosenberg, Ilana | authorlink2 = Rosenberg, Eugene | year = 2008 | title = Role of microorganisms in the evolution of animals and plants: the hologenome theory of evolution | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 723–35 | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00123.x | pmid=18549407}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was originally based on their observations of Vibrio shiloi-mediated bleaching of the coral ''Oculina patagonica''. Since its first introduction, the theory has been promoted as a fusion of Lamarckism and Darwinism and expanded to all of evolution, not just that of corals. The history of the development of the hologenome theory and the logic undergirding its development was the focus of a cover article by Carrie Arnold in New Scientist in January, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;"Creator of Species, The Hologenome, a New View of Evolution" https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21728992-000-the-hologenome-a-new-view-of-evolution/&lt;/ref&gt; The most comprehensive treatment of the theory, including updates by the Rosenbergs on neutrality, pathogenesis and multi-level selection, can be found in their [https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319042404 2013 book].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"The Hologenome Concept: Human, Animal and Plant Microbiota"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Robert Brucker]] and [[Seth Bordenstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6146/667.full | doi=10.1126/science.1240659 | pmid=23868918 | volume=341 | issue=6146 | title=The Hologenomic Basis of Speciation: Gut Bacteria Cause Hybrid Lethality in the Genus Nasonia | journal=Science | pages=667–669| bibcode=2013Sci...341..667B | last1=Brucker | first1=Robert M | last2=Bordenstein | first2=Seth R | year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; re-invigorated the hologenome concept by showing that the gut microbiomes of closely related ''[[Nasonia]]'' wasp species are distinguishable, and contribute to hybrid death. This set interactions between hosts and microbes in a conceptual continuum with interactions between genes in the same genome. In 2015, Bordenstein and [[Kevin R. Theis]] outlined a conceptual framework that aligns with pre-existing theories in biology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Support from vertebrate biology===
Multicellular life is made possible by the coordination of physically and temporally distinct processes, most prominently through [[hormone]]s. Hormones mediate critical activities in vertebrates, including ontogeny, somatic and reproductive physiology, sexual development, performance and behaviour. 
 
Many of these hormones – including most steroids and [[Thyroid hormone |thyroxines]] – are secreted in inactive form through the endocrine and apocrine systems into epithelial corridors in which microbiota are widespread and diverse, including gut, urinary tract, lung and skin. There, the inactive hormones can be re-activated by cleavage of the glucuronide or sulfate residue, allowing them to be reabsorbed. Thus the concentration and bioavailability of many of the hormones is impacted by microbial cleavage of conjugated intermediaries, itself determined by a diverse population with redundant enzymatic capabilities. Aspects of [[enterohepatic circulation]] have been known for decades, but had been viewed as an ancillary effect of detoxification and excretion of metabolites and xenobiotics, including effects on lifetimes of pharmaceuticals, including birth control formulations.

The basic premise is that a spectrum of hormones can be re-activated and resorbed from epithelia, potentially modulating effective time and dose relationships of many vertebrate hormones. The ability to alter and modulate, amplify and suppress, disseminate and recruit new capabilities as microbially-encoded 'traits' means that sampling, sensing and responding to the environment become intrinsic features and emergent capabilities of the holobiont, with mechanisms that can provide rapid, sensitive, nuanced and persistent performance changes. 
 
Studies by Froebe et al.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.scconline.org/pdf/cc1990/cc041n03/p00173-p00185.pdf Axillary malodor production: A new mechanism]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 indicating that essential mating pheromones, including androstenols, required activation by skin-associated microbial glucuronidases and sulfatases. In the absence of microbial populations in the skin, no detectable aromatic pheromone was released, as the pro-pheromone remained water-soluble and non-volatile. This effectively meant that the microbes in the skin were essential to produce a mating signal.&lt;ref name="vimeo.com"&gt;Enabling Innovation: A 2011 Lecture in the Illahee Series https://vimeo.com/26387884&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support from coral biology===
Subsequent re-articulation describing the hologenome theory by Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, published 13 years after Jefferson's definition of the theory, was based on their observations of corals, and the coral probiotic hypothesis.

[[File:CoralBleaching.jpg |thumb |250px |Unbleached and bleached coral]]

Coral reefs are the largest structures created by living organisms, and contain abundant and highly complex microbial communities. A coral "head" is a colony of genetically identical [[polyp]]s, which secrete an [[exoskeleton]] near the base. Depending on the species, the exoskeleton may be hard, based on [[calcium carbonate]], or soft and proteinaceous. Over many generations, the colony creates a large skeleton that is characteristic of the species. Diverse forms of life take up residence in a coral colony, including [[Photosynthesis |photosynthetic]] algae such as ''[[Zooxanthella |Symbiodinium]]'', as well as a wide range of bacteria including [[Nitrogen fixation |nitrogen fixers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shashar N, Feldstein T, Cohen Y, Loya Y |title=Nitrogen fixation (acetylene reduction) on a coral reef |journal=Coral Reefs |year=1994 |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=171–4 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v358131k0381525v/ |doi=10.1007/BF00301195 |bibcode=1994CorRe..13..171S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[chitin]] decomposers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ducklow HW, Mitchell R |title=Bacterial Populations and Adaptations in the Mucus Layers on Living Corals |journal=Limnology and Oceanography |year=1979 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=715–725 |jstor= 2835723 |doi=10.4319/lo.1979.24.4.0715 |bibcode=1979LimOc..24..715D }}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which form an important part of coral nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kushmaro A, Kramarsky-Winter E |chapter=Bacteria as a source of coral nutrition |veditors=Rosenberg E, Loya Y |title=Coral Health and Disease |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=Berlin Heidelberg |year=2004 |pages=231–241 |isbn=978-3-540-20772-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-gBuWCe6lfYC&amp;pg=PA231ots=vSpvYVhI2q#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association between coral and its [[microbiota (microbiology) |microbiota]] is species dependent, and different bacterial populations are found in mucus, skeleton and tissue from the same coral fragment.&lt;ref name="RRKLZR2006"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reshef L, Koren O, Loya Y, Zilber-Rosenberg I, Rosenberg E |title=The Coral Probiotic Hypothesis |journal=Environmental Microbiology |year=2006 |volume=8 |pages=2068–73 |url=http://www.tau.ac.il/lifesci/departments/zoology/members/loya/175.pdf.pdf |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01148.x |pmid=17107548 |issue=12 |citeseerx=10.1.1.627.6120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past several decades, major declines in coral populations have occurred. [[Climate change]], [[water pollution]] and [[overfishing]] are three stress factors that have been described as leading to disease susceptibility. Over twenty different coral diseases have been described, but of these, only a handful have had their causative agents isolated and characterized.

[[Coral bleaching]] is the most serious of these diseases. In the Mediterranean Sea, the bleaching of ''[[Oculina patagonica]]'' was first described in 1994 and, through a rigorous application of [[Koch's Postulates]], determined to be due to infection by ''[[Vibrio]] shiloi''.&lt;ref name="KRFL1997"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kushmaro A, Rosenberg E, Fine M, Loya Y |title=Bleaching of the coral Oculina patagonica by Vibrio AK-1 |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |year=1997 |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=159–165 |url=http://www.mendeley.com/research/bleaching-of-the-coral-oculina-patagonica-by-vibrio-ak-1/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130129193709/http://www.mendeley.com/research/bleaching-of-the-coral-oculina-patagonica-by-vibrio-ak-1/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-29 |doi=10.3354/meps147159 |quote=The causative agent, ''Vibrio'' AK-1, was present in 28 bleached ''O. patagonica'' examined, but absent from 24 healthy (unbleached) corals. The ''Vibrio'' sp. was isolated in pure culture, characterized microbiologically, and shown to cause bleaching when inoculated onto unbleached corals. |bibcode=1997MEPS..147..159K }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1994 to 2002, bacterial bleaching of ''O.&amp;nbsp;patagonica'' occurred every summer in the eastern Mediterranean. Surprisingly, however, after 2003, ''O.&amp;nbsp;patagonica'' in the eastern Mediterranean has been resistant to ''V.&amp;nbsp;shiloi'' infection, although other diseases still cause bleaching.

Beneficial mutations can arise and spread among the symbiotic microbes much faster than in the host corals. By altering its microbial composition, the "holobiont" can adapt to changing environmental conditions far more rapidly than by genetic mutation and selection in the host species alone.

Extrapolating the coral probiotic hypothesis to other organisms, including higher plants and animals, led to the Rosenberg's support for and publications around the hologenome theory of evolution.

==Theory==

===Definition===
{{prose|date=February 2017}}

The framework of the hologenome theory of evolution is as follows (condensed from Rosenberg ''et al.'', 2007):&lt;ref name="RKREZ2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Rosenberg E, Koren O, Reshef L, Efrony R, Zilber-Rosenberg I |title = The role of microorganisms in coral health, disease and evolution |journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology |year  = 2007 |volume = 5 |pages = 355–362 |url  = http://sequoia.ucmerced.edu/Shini/CGNGS/literature/Rosenberg_et_al_2007.pdf |doi  = 10.1038/nrmicro1635 |pmid  = 17384666 |issue = 5}}{{dead link |date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "All animals and plants establish [[symbiotic]] relationships with microorganisms."
* "Different host species contain different symbiont populations and individuals of the same species can also contain different symbiont populations."
* "The association between a host organism and its microbial community affect both the host and its microbiota."
* "The genetic information encoded by microorganisms can change under environmental demands more rapidly, and by more processes, than the genetic information encoded by the host organism."
* "...&amp;nbsp;the genome of the host can act in consortium with the genomes of the associated symbiotic microorganisms to create a hologenome. This hologenome...can change more rapidly than the host genome alone, thereby conferring greater adaptive potential to the combined holobiont evolution."
* "Each of these points taken together [led Rosenberg ''et al.'' to propose that] the holobiont with its hologenome should be considered as the unit of natural selection in evolution."

Some authors supplement the above principles with an additional one. If a given holobiont is to be considered a unit of natural selection: 
* The hologenome must be heritable from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="Fe2011"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Feldhaar H |title=Bacterial symbionts as mediators of ecologically important traits of insect hosts |journal=Ecological Entomology |year=2011 |volume=5 |pages=533–543 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2011.01318.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GMBBGMPR2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gilbert SF, McDonald E, Boyle N, Buttino N, Gyi L, Mai M, Prakash N, Robinson J |title=Symbiosis as a source of selectable epigenetic variation: taking the heat for the big guy |journal=Phil.

Ten principles of holobionts and hologenomes were presented in PLOS Biology:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

* I. Holobionts and hologenomes are units of biological organization
* II. Holobionts and hologenomes are not organ systems, superorganisms, or metagenomes
* III. The hologenome is a comprehensive gene system
* IV. The hologenome concept reboots elements of Lamarckian evolution
* V. Hologenomic variation integrates all mechanisms of mutation
* VI. Hologenomic evolution is most easily understood by equating a gene in the nuclear genome to a microbe in the microbiome
* VII. The hologenome concept fits squarely into genetics and accommodates multilevel selection theory
* VIII. The hologenome is shaped by selection and neutrality
* IX. Hologenomic speciation blends genetics and symbiosis
* X. Holobionts and their hologenomes do not change the rules of evolutionary biology

===Horizontally versus vertically transmitted symbionts===

Many case studies clearly demonstrate the importance of an organism's associated microbiota to its existence. (For example, see the numerous case studies in the [[Microbiome]] article.) However, horizontal ''versus'' vertical transmission of [[endosymbiont]]s must be distinguished. Endosymbionts whose transmission is predominantly vertical may be considered as contributing to the heritable genetic variation present in a host species.&lt;ref name="Fe2011"/&gt;

In the case of colonial organisms such as corals, the microbial associations of the colony persist even though individual members of the colony, reproducing asexually, live and die. Corals also have a sexual mode of reproduction, resulting in [[plankton]]ic larva; it is less clear whether microbial associations persist through this stage of growth. Also, the bacterial community of a colony may change with the seasons.&lt;ref name="RRKLZR2006"/&gt;

Many insects maintain heritable obligate symbiosis relationships with bacterial partners. For example, normal development of female wasps of the species ''Asobara tabida'' is dependent on ''[[Wolbachia]]'' infection. If "cured" of the infection, their ovaries degenerate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pannebakker BA, Loppin B, Elemans CP, Humblot L, Vavre F |title=Parasitic inhibition of cell death facilitates symbiosis |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA |year=2007 |volume=104 |pages=213–5 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/104/1/213.full |doi=10.1073/pnas.0607845104 |pmid= 17190825 |issue= 1 |pmc= 1765438|bibcode=2007PNAS..104..213P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transmission of the infection is vertical through the egg cytoplasm.

In contrast, many obligate symbiosis relationships have been described in the literature where transmission of the symbionts is via horizontal transfer. A well-studied example is the nocturnally feeding squid ''[[Euprymna scolopes]]'', which camouflages its outline against the moonlit ocean surface by emitting light from its underside with the aid of the symbiotic bacterium ''[[Vibrio fischeri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Visick KL, Ruby EG |title=''Vibrio fischeri'' and its host: it takes two to tango |journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology |year=2006 |volume=9 |pages=632–8 |url=http://www.medmicro.wisc.edu/labs/mcfall_ruby_papers/pdf/2006/Visick_Ruby_2006_CurrOpin.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611053013/http://www.medmicro.wisc.edu/labs/mcfall_ruby_papers/pdf/2006/Visick_Ruby_2006_CurrOpin.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-06-11 |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2006.10.001 |issue=6 |pmid=17049299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rosenbergs cite this example within the context of the hologenome theory of evolution.&lt;ref name="RR2011"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rosenberg E, Zilber-Rosenberg I |title=Symbiosis and development: The hologenome concept |journal=Birth Defects Research Part C: Embryo Today: Reviews |year=2011 |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=56–66 |doi=10.1002/bdrc.20196|pmid=21425442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Squid and bacterium maintain a highly co-evolved relationship. The newly hatched squid collects its bacteria from the sea water, and lateral transfer of symbionts between hosts permits faster transfer of beneficial mutations within a host species than are possible with mutations within the host genome.

===Primary versus secondary symbionts===
[[File:Nezara viridula MHNT verte.jpg |thumb |150px |Green Vegetable Bug ([[Nezara viridula]]) in [[Fronton, Haute-Garonne |Fronton]], France]]
Another traditional distinction between endosymbionts has been between primary and secondary symbionts.&lt;ref name="Fe2011"/&gt; Primary endosymbionts reside in specialized host cells that may be organized into larger, organ-like structures (in insects, the [[bacteriome]]). Associations between hosts and primary endosymbionts are usually ancient, with an estimated age of tens to hundreds of millions of years. According to [[endosymbiotic theory]], extreme cases of primary endosymbionts include [[mitochondria]], [[plastids]] (including [[chloroplasts]]), and possibly other organelles of eukaryotic cells. Primary endosymbionts are usually transmitted exclusively vertically, and the relationship is always mutualistic and generally obligate for both partners. Primary endosymbiosis is surprisingly common. An estimated 15% of insect species, for example, harbor this type of endosymbiont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Baumann P |title=Bacteriology of bacteriocyte-associated endosymbionts of plant sap-sucking insects |journal=[[Annual Review of Microbiology]] |year=2005 |volume=59 |pages=155–189 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.59.030804.121041 |pmid=16153167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, secondary endosymbiosis is often facultative, at least from the host point of view, and the associations are less ancient. Secondary endosymbionts do not reside in specialized host tissues, but may dwell in the body cavity dispersed in fat, muscle, or nervous tissue, or may grow within the gut. Transmission may be via vertical, horizontal, or both vertical and horizontal transfer. The relationship between host and secondary endosymbiont is not necessarily beneficial to the host; indeed, the relationship may be parasitic.&lt;ref name="Fe2011"/&gt;

The distinction between vertical and horizontal transfer, and between primary and secondary endosymbiosis is not absolute, but follows a continuum, and may be subject to environmental influences. For example, in the [[Pentatomidae|stink bug]] ''Nezara viridula'', the vertical transmission rate of symbionts, which females provide to offspring by smearing the eggs with gastric [[Cecum |caeca]], was 100% at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, but decreased to 8% at 30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prado SS, Golden M, Follett PA, Daugherty MP, Almeida RP |title=Demography of Gut Symbiotic and Aposymbiotic ''Nezara viridula'' L. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) |journal=Environmental Entomology |year=2009 |volume=38 |pages=103–109 |url=http://ddr.nal.usda.gov/bitstream/10113/28541/1/IND44191437.pdf |doi=10.1603/022.038.0112 |pmid=19791602 |issue=1 }}{{dead link |date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in aphids, the vertical transmission of bacteriocytes containing the primary endosymbiont ''Buchnera'' is drastically reduced at high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montllor CB, Maxmen A, Purcell AH |title=Facultative bacterial endosymbionts benefit pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum under heat stress |journal=Ecological Entomology |year=2002 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=189–195 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2311.2002.00393.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In like manner, the distinction between [[commensalism |commensal]], [[Mutualism (biology) |mutualistic]], and [[parasitism |parasitic]] relationships is also not absolute. An example is the relationship between [[legume]]s and [[Rhizobium |rhizobial]] species: N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake is energetically more costly than the uptake of fixed nitrogen from the soil, so soil N is preferred if not limiting. During the early stages of nodule formation, the plant-rhizobial relationship actually resembles a pathogenesis more than it does a mutualistic association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors=Pérez-Giménez J, Quelas JI, Lodeiro AR |chapter=Competition for Nodulation |editor=El-Shemy HA |title=Soybean Physiology and Biochemistry |year=2011 |publisher=InTech |url=http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/competition-for-nodulation |isbn=978-953-307-534-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neo-Lamarckism within a Darwinian context===
[[File:Neo-Lamarckian inheritance of hologenome.svg|thumb|upright=2.5|[[Lamarckism|Neo-Lamarckian]] inheritance of hologenome]]
[[Lamarckism]], the concept that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring (also known as [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] or [[soft inheritance]]) incorporated two common ideas of its time:

* Use and disuse – individuals lose characteristics they do not require (or use) and develop characteristics that are useful.
* Inheritance of acquired traits – individuals inherit the traits of their ancestors.

Although Lamarckian theory was rejected by the [[neo-Darwinism]] of the [[modern synthesis (20th century) |modern evolutionary synthesis]] in which evolution occurs through random variations being subject to [[natural selection]], the hologenome theory has aspects that harken back to Lamarckian concepts. In addition to the traditionally recognized modes of variation (''i.e.'' [[Genetic recombination |sexual recombination]], chromosomal rearrangement, mutation), the holobiont allows for two additional mechanisms of variation that are specific to the hologenome theory: (1) changes in the relative population of existing microorganisms (''i.e.'' amplification and reduction) and (2) acquisition of novel strains from the environment, which may be passed on to offspring.&lt;ref name="RR2011"/&gt;

Changes in the relative population of existing microorganisms corresponds to Lamarckian "use and disuse", while the ability to acquire novel strains from the environment, which may be passed on to offspring, corresponds to Lamarckian "inheritance of acquired traits". The hologenome theory, therefore, is said by its proponents to incorporate Lamarckian aspects within a Darwinian framework.&lt;ref name="RR2011"/&gt;

==Additional case studies==
[[File:Acyrthosiphon pisum (pea aphid)-PLoS.jpg |thumb |200px |Pea aphids extracting sap from the stem and leaves of garden peas]]
The [[pea aphid]] ''Acyrthosiphon pisum'' maintains an obligate symbiotic relationship with the bacterium ''[[Buchnera (proteobacteria) |Buchnera aphidicola]]'', which is transmitted maternally to the embryos that develop within the mother's [[ovariole]]s. [[Acyrthosiphon pisum |Pea aphids]] live on sap, which is rich in sugars but deficient in amino acids. They rely on their ''Buchnera'' endosymbiotic population for essential amino acids, supplying in exchange nutrients as well as a protected intracellular environment that allows ''Buchnera'' to grow and reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gómez-Valero L, Soriano-Navarro M, Pérez-Brocal V, Heddi A, Moya A, García-Verdugo JM, Latorre A |title=Coexistence of Wolbachia with Buchnera aphidicola and a Secondary Symbiont in the Aphid Cinara cedri |journal=J.

Both strains are present in field populations, suggesting that under some conditions, increased heat tolerance is advantageous to the host, while under other conditions, decreased heat tolerance but increased cold tolerance may be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dunbar HE, Wilson AC, Ferguson NR, Moran NA |title=Aphid Thermal Tolerance Is Governed by a Point Mutation in Bacterial Symbionts |journal=PLoS Biology |date=May 2007 |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e96 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050096 |pmid=17425405 |pmc=1847839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One can consider the variant ''Buchnera'' genomes as [[allele]]s for the larger hologenome.&lt;ref name="GMBBGMPR2010"/&gt; The association between ''Buchnera'' and aphids began about 200 million years ago, with host and symbiont co-evolving since that time; in particular, it has been discovered that genome size in various ''Buchnera'' species has become extremely reduced, in some cases down to 450&amp;nbsp;kb, which is far smaller even than the 580&amp;nbsp;kb genome of ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gil R, Sabater-Muñoz B, Latorre A, Silva FJ, Moya A |title=Extreme genome reduction in ''Buchnera'' spp.: Toward the minimal genome needed for symbiotic life |journal=Proc.

Development of mating preferences, ''i.e.'' [[sexual selection]], is considered to be an early event in [[speciation]]. In 1989, Dodd reported mating preferences in ''[[Drosophila]]'' that were induced by diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dodd DMB  |title=Reproductive Isolation as a Consequence of Adaptive Divergence in ''Drosophila pseudoobscura''  |journal=Evolution  |date=September 1989  |volume=43  |issue=6  |pages=1308–11 |url=http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Dodd_1989.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302120058/http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Courses/Ecol525/Readings/Dodd_1989.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-03-02  |doi=10.2307/2409365|jstor=2409365  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has recently been demonstrated that when otherwise identical populations of ''Drosophila'' were switched in diet between molasses medium and starch medium, that the "molasses flies" preferred to mate with other molasses flies, while the "starch flies" preferred to mate with other starch flies. This mating preference appeared after only one generation and was maintained for at least 37 generations. The origin of these differences were changes in the flies' populations of a particular bacterial symbiont, ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]''. Antibiotic treatment abolished the induced mating preferences. It appears that the symbiotic bacteria changed the levels of cuticular hydrocarbon sex [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharon G, Segal D, Ringo JM, Hefetz A, Zilber-Rosenberg I, Rosenberg E |title=Commensal bacteria play a role in mating preference of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' |journal=Proc.

Zilber-Rosenberg and Rosenberg (2008) have tabulated many of the ways in which symbionts are transmitted and their contributions to the fitness of the holobiont, beginning with mitochondria found in all [[eukaryote]]s, [[chloroplast]] in plants, and then various associations described in specific systems. The microbial contributions to host fitness included provision of specific amino acids, growth at high temperatures, provision of nutritional needs from cellulose, nitrogen metabolism, recognition signals, more efficient food utilization, protection of eggs and embryos against metabolism, camouflage against predators, photosynthesis, breakdown of complex polymers, stimulation of the immune system, [[angiogenesis]], vitamin synthesis, fiber breakdown, fat storage, supply of minerals from the soil, supply of organics, acceleration of mineralization, carbon cycling, and salt tolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zilber-Rosenberg I, Rosenberg E |title=Role of microorganisms in the evolution of animals and plants: the hologenome theory of evolution |journal=FEMS Microbiology Reviews |year=2008 |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=723–735 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00123.x |pmid=18549407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism ==
The hologenome theory is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leggat W, Ainsworth T, Bythell J, Dove S, Gates R, Hoegh-Guldberg O, Iglesias-Prieto R, Yellowlees D |title=The hologenome theory disregards the coral holobiont |journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology |year=2007 |volume=5 |pages=Online Correspondence |url=http://www.nature.com/nrmicro/journal/v5/n10/full/nrmicro1635-c1.html |doi=10.1038/nrmicro1635-c1 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major criticism by Ainsworth ''et al.'' has been their claim that ''V.&amp;nbsp;shiloi'' was misidentified as the causative agent of coral bleaching, and that its presence in bleached ''O.&amp;nbsp;patagonica'' was simply that of opportunistic colonization.&lt;ref name="AFRH2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ainsworth TD, Fine M, Roff G, Hoegh-Guldberg O |title=Bacteria are not the primary cause of bleaching in the Mediterranean coral ''Oculina patagonica'' |journal=The ISME Journal |year=2008 |volume=2 |pages=67–73 |url=http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/v2/n1/full/ismej200788a.html |doi=10.1038/ismej.2007.88 |pmid=18059488 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If this is true, the original observation that led to Rosenberg's later articulation of the theory would be invalid. On the other hand, Ainsworth ''et al.''&lt;ref name="AFRH2008"/&gt; performed their samplings in 2005, two years after the Rosenberg group discovered ''O.&amp;nbsp;patagonica'' no longer to be susceptible to ''V.&amp;nbsp;shiloi'' infection; therefore their finding that bacteria are not the primary cause of present-day bleaching in Mediterranean coral ''O.&amp;nbsp;patagonica'' should not be considered surprising. The rigorous satisfaction of Koch's postulates, as employed in Kushmaro ''et al.'' (1997),&lt;ref name="KRFL1997"/&gt; is generally accepted as providing a definitive identification of infectious disease agents.

Baird ''et al.'' (2009)&lt;ref name="BBRT2009"/&gt; have questioned basic assumptions made by Reshef ''et al.'' (2006)&lt;ref name="RRKLZR2006"/&gt; in presuming that (1) coral generation times are too slow to adjust to novel stresses over the observed time scales, and that (2) the scale of dispersal of coral larvae is too large to allow for adaptation to local environments. They may simply have underestimated the potential rapidity of conventional means of natural selection. In cases of severe stress, multiple cases have been documented of ecologically significant evolutionary change occurring over a handful of generations.&lt;ref name="CHRF2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carroll SP, Hendry AP, Reznick DN, Fox CW |title=Evolution on ecological time-scales  |journal=Functional Ecology |year=2007 |volume=21 |pages=387–393
 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2435.2007.01289.x |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novel adaptive mechanisms such as switching symbionts might not be necessary for corals to adjust to rapid climate change or novel stressors.&lt;ref name="BBRT2009"/&gt;
 
Organisms in symbiotic relationships evolve to accommodate each other, and the symbiotic relationship increases the overall fitness of the participant species. Although the hologenome theory is still being debated, it has gained a significant degree of popularity within the scientific community as a way of explaining rapid adaptive changes that are difficult to accommodate within a traditional Darwinian framework.&lt;ref name="RR2011"/&gt;

Definitions and uses of the words holobiont and hologenome also differ between proponents and skeptics,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Theis |first=Kevin R. |last2=Dheilly |first2=Nolwenn M. |last3=Klassen |first3=Jonathan L. |last4=Brucker |first4=Robert M. |last5=Baines |first5=John F. |last6=Bosch |first6=Thomas C.

Ongoing discourse is attempting to clear this confusion. Theis et al. clarify that "critiquing the hologenome concept is not synonymous with critiquing coevolution, and arguing that an entity is not a primary unit of selection dismisses the fact that the hologenome concept has always embraced multilevel selection."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For instance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6200/1011.1.abstract Comment on “The hologenomic basis of speciation: Gut bacteria cause hybrid lethality in the genus Nasonia” | Science]&lt;/ref&gt; Chandler and Turelli (2014) criticize the conclusions of Brucker and Bordenstein (2013), noting that their observations are also consistent with an alternative explanation. Brucker and Bordenstein (2014) responded to these criticisms, claiming they were unfounded&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6200/1011.2.abstract Response to Comment on “The hologenomic basis of speciation: Gut bacteria cause hybrid lethality in the genus Nasonia” | Science]&lt;/ref&gt; because of factual inaccuracies and altered arguments and definitions that were not advanced by Brucker and Bordenstein (2013).

Recently, [[Forest L Rohwer]] and colleagues developed a novel statistical test to examine the potential for the hologenome theory of evolution in coral species.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ismej2015190a.html The ISME Journal - Stable and sporadic symbiotic communities of coral and algal holobionts]&lt;/ref&gt; They found that coral species do not inherit microbial communities, and are instead colonized by a core group of microbes that associate with a diversity of species. The authors conclude: "Identification of these two symbiont communities supports the holobiont model and calls into question the hologenome theory of evolution." However, other studies in coral adhere to the original and pluralistic definitions of holobionts and hologenomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bourne |first=David G. |last2=Morrow |first2=Kathleen M. |last3=Webster |first3=Nicole S. |date=2016-01-01 |title=Insights into the Coral Microbiome: Underpinning the Health and Resilience of Reef Ecosystems |journal=Annual Review of Microbiology |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=317-40 |doi=10.1146/annurev-micro-102215-095440 |pmid=27482741}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Bourne, Kathleen Morrow and Nicole Webster clarify that "The combined genomes of this coral holobiont form a coral hologenome, and genomic interactions within the hologenome ultimately define the coral phenotype."

In [[quantum mechanics]], the '''intrinsic parity''' is a [[phase factor]] that arises as an [[eigenvalue]] of the [[Parity (physics)|parity]] operation &lt;math&gt; x_i \rightarrow x_i' = -x_i&lt;/math&gt; (a reflection about the origin). To see that the parity's eigenvalues are phase factors, we assume an eigenstate of the parity operation (this is realized because the intrinsic parity is a property of a [[subatomic particle|particle]] species) and use the fact that two parity transformations leave the particle in the same state, thus the new wave function can differ by only a phase factor, i.e.: &lt;math&gt;P^{2} \psi = e^{i \phi} \psi&lt;/math&gt; thus &lt;math&gt;P \psi = \pm e^{i \phi /2} \psi&lt;/math&gt;, since these are the only eigenstates satisfying the above equation. 

The intrinsic parity's phase is conserved for non-[[Weak interaction|weak]] interactions (the product of the intrinsic parities is the same before and after the reaction). As &lt;math&gt;[P,H]=0&lt;/math&gt; the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] is invariant under a parity transformation. The intrinsic parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parities of the particles, for instance for noninteracting particles we have &lt;math&gt;P(|1\rangle|2\rangle)=(P|1\rangle)(P|2\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the parity commutes with the Hamiltonian and &lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt; its eigenvalue does not [[Heisenberg picture|change with time]], therefore the intrinsic parities phase is a conserved quantity.

A consequence of the [[Dirac equation]] is that the intrinsic parity of fermions and antifermions obey the relation &lt;math&gt;P_{\bar{f}}P_f = - 1&lt;/math&gt;, so particles and their antiparticles have the opposite parity. Single leptons can never be created or destroyed in experiments, as [[lepton number]] is a conserved quantity. This means experiments are unable to distinguish the sign of a leptons parity, so by convention it is chosen that leptons have intrinsic parity +1, antileptons have &lt;math&gt;P = -1&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly the parity of the quarks is chosen to be +1, and antiquarks is -1.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, B.R, Shaw, G. (2002). Particle Physics. Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''introspection illusion''' is a [[cognitive bias]] in which people wrongly think they have direct insight into the origins of their mental states, while treating others' [[introspection]]s as unreliable. In certain situations, this illusion leads people to make confident but false explanations of their own behaviour (called "causal theories"&lt;ref name=SocPsy/&gt;) or inaccurate [[affective forecasting|predictions of their future mental states]].

The illusion has been examined in [[psychological]] experiments, and suggested as a basis for biases in how people compare themselves to others. These experiments have been interpreted as suggesting that, rather than offering direct access to the processes underlying mental states, [[introspection]] is a process of construction and [[inference]], much as people indirectly infer others' mental states from their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2002|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When people mistake unreliable introspection for genuine self-knowledge, the result can be an [[illusory superiority|illusion of superiority]] over other people, for example when each person thinks they are less biased and less conformist than the rest of the group. Even when experimental subjects are provided with reports of other subjects' introspections, in as detailed a form as possible, they still rate those other introspections as unreliable while treating their own as reliable. Although the hypothesis of an introspection illusion informs some psychological research, the existing evidence is arguably inadequate to decide how reliable introspection is in normal circumstances.&lt;ref name="knowing_more"/&gt; Correction for the bias may be possible through education about the bias and its unconscious nature.&lt;ref name="introspectionillusion"&gt;{{harvnb|Pronin|2009|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

The phrase "introspection illusion" was coined by [[Emily Pronin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=The Mind of the Market: Compassionate Apes, Competitive Humans, and Other Tales from Evolutionary Economics |publisher=Times Books |year=2007 |page=72 |isbn=978-0-8050-7832-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pronin describes the illusion as having four components:
# People give a strong weighting to introspective evidence when assessing themselves.
# They do not give such a strong weight when assessing others.
# People disregard their own behaviour when assessing themselves (but not others).
# Own introspections are more highly weighted than others. It is not just that people lack access to each other's introspections: they regard only their own as reliable.&lt;ref name="adv5"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pronin|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unreliability of introspection==

{{Quote box |quote=[I]ntrospection does not provide a direct pipeline to nonconscious mental processes. Instead, it is best thought of as a process whereby people use the contents of consciousness to construct a personal narrative that may or may not correspond to their nonconscious states. |source=[[Timothy D. Wilson]] and Elizabeth W. Dunn (2004)&lt;ref name="annreview"/&gt; |width=20% |align=right}}

A 1977 paper by psychologists [[Richard Nisbett]] and [[Timothy D. Wilson]] challenged the directness and reliability of introspection, thereby becoming one of the most cited papers in the science of consciousness.&lt;ref name="tellingmore"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1977 |title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes |journal= Psychological Review |volume=84 |issue=3 |pages=231–259 |ref=harv |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.231|last1=Nisbett |first1=Richard E. |last2=Wilson |first2=Timothy D. }} reprinted in {{cite book |title=Social cognition: key readings |editor=David Lewis Hamilton |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-86377-591-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="something"/&gt; Nisbett and Wilson reported on experiments in which subjects verbally explained why they had a particular preference, or how they arrived at a particular idea. On the basis of these studies and existing [[attribution (psychology)|attribution]] research, they concluded that reports on mental processes are [[confabulated]]. They wrote that subjects had, "little or no introspective access to higher order cognitive processes".&lt;ref name="strangers104"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wilson|2002|pp=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; They distinguished between mental ''contents'' (such as feelings) and mental ''processes'', arguing that while introspection gives us access to contents, processes remain hidden.&lt;ref name=tellingmore/&gt;

[[File:Five Senses03.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Research continues to find that humans [[Evolution|evolved]] only limited abilities to introspect]]

Although some other experimental work followed from the Nisbett and Wilson paper, difficulties with testing the hypothesis of introspective access meant that research on the topic generally stagnated.&lt;ref name="something"/&gt; A ten-year-anniversary review of the paper raised several objections, questioning the idea of "process" they had used and arguing that unambiguous tests of introspective access are hard to achieve.&lt;ref name="knowing_more"&gt;{{cite journal |last=White |first=Peter A. |year=1988 |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=79 |title=Knowing more about what we can tell: 'Introspective access' and causal report accuracy 10 years later |publisher=British Psychological Society |issue=1 |pages=13–45 |ref=harv |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1988.tb02271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Updating the theory in 2002, Wilson admitted that the 1977 claims had been too far-reaching.&lt;ref name="strangers104"/&gt; He instead relied on the theory that the ''[[adaptive unconscious]]'' does much of the moment-to-moment work of perception and behaviour. When people are asked to report on their mental processes, they cannot access this unconscious activity.&lt;ref name="annreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Dunn|first2=Elizabeth W.|title=Self-Knowledge: Its Limits, Value, and Potential for Improvement|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=2004|volume=55|issue=1|pages=493–518|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141954|pmid=14744224 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than acknowledge their lack of insight, they [[confabulate]] a plausible explanation, and "seem" to be "unaware of their unawareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 22, 2008 |title=The Unseen Mind |journal=Science |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |volume= 321 |pages=1046–1047 |doi=10.1126/science.1163029 |pmid=18719269 |issue=5892 |ref=harv|author1=Wilson |first1=T. D. |last2=Bar-Anan |first2=Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that people can be mistaken about their inner functioning is one applied by [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialists]]. These philosophers suggest that some concepts, including "belief" or "pain" will turn out to be quite different from what is commonly expected as science advances.

The faulty guesses that people make to explain their thought processes have been called "causal theories".&lt;ref name=SocPsy&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aronson |first1=Elliot |first2=Timothy D. |last2=Wilson |first3=Robin M. |last3=Akert |first4=Samuel R. |last4=Sommers|title=Social Psychology |edition= 9th |year=2015 |location= |publisher=Pearson Education |ref=harv|isbn=9780133936544|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causal theories provided after an action will often serve only to justify the person's behaviour in order to relieve [[cognitive dissonance]]. That is, a person may not have noticed the real reasons for their behaviour, even when trying to provide explanations. The result is an explanation that mostly just makes themselves feel better. An example might be a man who discriminates against homosexuals because he is embarrassed that he himself is attracted to other men. He may not admit this to himself, instead claiming his prejudice is because he believes that homosexuality is unnatural.

A study conducted by philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel and psychologist Russell T. Hurlburt was set up to measure the extent of introspective accuracy by gathering introspective reports from a single individual who was given the pseudonym "Melanie". Melanie was given a beeper which sounded at random moments, and when it did she had to note what she was currently feeling and thinking. After analyzing the reports the authors had mixed views about the results, the correct interpretation of Melanie's claims and her introspective accuracy. Even after long discussion the two authors disagreed with each other in the closing remarks, Schwitzgebel being pessimistic and Hurlburt optimistic about the reliability of introspection.&lt;ref name=Hurlburt&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwitzgebel and Hurlburt |title=Describing Inner Experience?|year=2007|publisher=MIT Press|url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11340 |isbn=978-0-262-08366-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors in accuracy===

Nisbett and Wilson conjectured about several factors that they found to contribute to the accuracy of introspective self-reports on cognition.&lt;ref name=tellingmore/&gt;
*''Availability'':  Stimuli that are highly [[:wikt:salient|salient]] (either due to [[recency]] or being very memorable) are more likely to be recalled and considered for the cause of a response.
*''[[Plausibility]]'':  Whether a person finds a stimulus to be a sufficiently likely cause for an effect determines the influence it has on their reporting of the stimulus.
*''Removal in time'':  The greater the distance in time since the occurrence of an event, the less available and more difficult to accurately recall it is.
*''Mechanics of judgment'':  People do not recognize the influence that judgment factors (e.g., position effects) have on them, leading to inaccuracies in self-reporting.
*''[[Context (language use)|Context]]'':  Focusing on the context of an object distracts from evaluation of that object and can lead people to falsely believe that their thoughts about the object are represented by the context.
*''Non-events'':  The absence of an occurrence is naturally less salient and available than an occurrence itself, leading nonevents to have little influence on reports.
*''Nonverbal behaviour'':  While people receive a large amount of information about others via [[nonverbal]] cues, the verbal nature of relaying information and the difficulty of translating nonverbal behaviour into verbal form lead to its lower reporting frequency.
*''Discrepancy between the magnitudes of [[causality|cause and effect]]'':  Because it seems natural to assume that a certain size cause will lead to a similarly-sized effect, connections between causes and effects of different magnitudes are not often drawn.

===Unawareness of error===

Several hypotheses to explain people's unawareness of their inaccuracies in introspection were provided by Nisbett and Wilson:&lt;ref name=tellingmore/&gt;
*''Confusion between [[Process theory|content and process]]'':  People are usually unable to access the exact process by which they arrived at a [[Result|conclusion]], but can recall an intermediate step prior to the result. However, this step is still content in nature, not a process. The confusion of these discrete forms leads people to believe that they are able to understand their judgment processes. (Nisbett and Wilson have been criticized for failing to provide a clear definition of the differences between mental content and mental processes.) 
*''Knowledge of prior [[idiosyncratic]] reactions to a stimulus'':  An individual's belief that they react in an abnormal manner to a stimulus, which would be unpredictable from the standpoint of an outside observer, seems to support true introspective ability. However, these perceived [[covariation]]s may actually be false, and truly abnormal covariations are rare.
*''Differences in causal theories between subcultures'':  The inherent differences between discrete subcultures necessitates that they have some differing causal theories for any one stimulus. Thus, an outsider would not have the same ability to discern a true cause as would an insider, again making it seem to the introspector that they have the capacity to understand the judgment process better than can another.
*''Attentional and intentional knowledge'':  An individual may consciously know that they were not paying attention to a certain stimulus or did not have a certain intent. Again, as insight that an outside observer does not have, this seems indicative of true introspective ability. However, the authors note that such knowledge can actually mislead the individual in the case that it is not as influential as they may think.
*''Inadequate feedback'':  By nature, introspection is difficult to be [[Disconfirmation bias|disconfirmed]] in everyday life, where there are no tests of it and others tend not to question one's introspections. Moreover, when a person's causal theory of reasoning is seemingly disconfirmed, it is easy for them to produce alternative reasons for why the evidence is actually not disconfirmatory at all.
*''[[Motivation]]al reasons'':  Considering one's own ability to understand their reasoning as being equivalent to an outsider's is intimidating and a threat to the ego and sense of control. Thus, people do not like to entertain the idea, instead maintaining the belief that they can accurately introspect.

===Criticisms===

The claim that confabulation of justifications evolved to relieve cognitive dissonance is criticized by some evolutionary biologists for assuming the evolution of a mechanism for feeling dissonanced by a lack of justification. These evolutionary biologists argue that if [[cause and effect|causal theories]] had no higher predictive accuracy than prejudices that would have been in place even without causal theories, there would be no evolutionary selection for experiencing any form of discomfort from lack of causal theories.&lt;ref&gt;John Relethford (2017), "50 Great Myths of Human Evolution: Understanding Misconceptions about Our Origins"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;António Zilhão (2010), "Evolution, rationality and cognition"&lt;/ref&gt; The claim that studies in the United States that appear to show a link between homophobia and homosexuality can be explained by an actual such link is criticized by many scholars. Since much homophobia in the United States is due to religious indoctrination and therefore unrelated to personal sexual preferences, they argue that the appearance of a link is due to volunteer-biased erotica research in which religious homophobes fear God's judgment but not being recorded as "homosexual" by Earthly psychologists while most non-homophobes are misled by [[false dichotomy|false dichotomies]] to assume that the notion that men can be sexually fluid is somehow "homophobic" and "unethical".&lt;ref&gt;Paul G. Nestor, Russell K. Schutt (2014), "Research Methods in Psychology: Investigating Human Behavior"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Choice blindness==
{{See also|Change blindness}}
Inspired by the Nisbett and Wilson paper, [[Petter Johansson]] and colleagues investigated subjects' insight into their own preferences using a new technique. Subjects saw two photographs of people and were asked which they found more attractive. They were given a closer look at their "chosen" photograph and asked to verbally explain their choice. However, in some trials, the experimenter had slipped them the other photograph rather than the one they had chosen, using [[sleight of hand]].&lt;ref name=Johansson2005&gt;{{cite journal|title=Failure to Detect Mismatches Between Intention and Outcome in a Simple Decision Task |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5745 |pages=116–119 |date=October 7, 2005 |url=http://beyond-belief.org.uk/sites/beyond-belief.org.uk/files/Johansson_et_al-2005-Failure_to_detect_mismatches.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.1111709 |pmid=16210542 |ref=harv |author1=Johansson |first1=P |last2=Hall |first2=L |last3=Sikström |first3=S |last4=Olsson |first4=A |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222080249/http://beyond-belief.org.uk/sites/beyond-belief.org.uk/files/Johansson_et_al-2005-Failure_to_detect_mismatches.pdf |archivedate=December 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of subjects failed to notice that the picture they were looking at did not match the one they had chosen just seconds before. Many subjects confabulated explanations of their preference. For example, a man might say "I preferred this one because I prefer [[blonde]]s" when he had in fact pointed to the dark-haired woman, but had been handed a blonde.&lt;ref name="something"&gt;{{cite journal|title=How something can be said about telling more than we can know: On choice blindness and introspection |publisher=Elsevier |year=2006 |journal=Consciousness and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=673–692 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.004 |pmid=17049881 |ref=harv |author1=Johansson |first1=P |last2=Hall |first2=L |last3=Sikström |first3=S |last4=Tärning |first4=B |last5=Lind |first5=A |url=https://www.lucs.lu.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Johansson_et_al-2006-How_Something_Can_Be_Said.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605003648/https://www.lucs.lu.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Johansson_et_al-2006-How_Something_Can_Be_Said.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These must have been [[confabulation|confabulated]] because they explain a choice that was never made.&lt;ref name=Johansson2005/&gt; The large proportion of subjects who were taken in by the deception contrasts with the 84% who, in post-test interviews, said that hypothetically they would have detected a switch if it had been made in front of them. The researchers coined the phrase "'''choice blindness'''" for this failure to detect a mismatch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Consciousness and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=4 |year=2008 |pages=697–699 |publisher=Elsevier |title=Reply to commentary by Moore and Haggard |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.10.001 |ref=harv|last1=Hall |first1=Lars |last2=Johansson |first2=Petter |last3=Sikström |first3=Sverker |last4=Tärning |first4=Betty |last5=Lind |first5=Andreas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A follow-up experiment involved shoppers in a supermarket tasting two different kinds of jam, then verbally explaining their preferred choice while taking further spoonfuls from the "chosen" pot. However, the pots were rigged so that, when explaining their choice, the subjects were tasting the jam they had actually rejected. A similar experiment was conducted with tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Cognition|volume=117|issue=1|pages=54–61 |year=2010|title=Magic at the marketplace: Choice blindness for the taste of jam and the smell of tea

Research by Paul Eastwick and Eli Finkel (described as "one of the leading lights in the realm of relationship psychology")&lt;ref name="veconomist"&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Unorthodox advice for rescuing a marriage|url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21730135-eli-finkel-counsels-lowering-expectations-hard-times-esther-perel-advises-grappling|work=[[The Economist]]|date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Northwestern University]] also undermined the idea that subjects have direct introspective awareness of what attracts them to other people. These researchers examined male and female subjects' reports of what they found attractive. Men typically reported that physical attractiveness was crucial while women identified earning potential as most important. These subjective reports did not predict their actual choices in a [[speed dating]] context, or their dating behaviour in a one-month follow-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 2008 |title=Sex differences in mate preferences revisited: Do people know what they initially desire in a romantic partner? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher= American Psychological Association |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=245–264 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.94.2.245 |pmid=18211175 |ref=harv |author1=Eastwick |first1=P.

Consistent with choice blindness, Henkel and Mather found that people are easily convinced by false reminders that they chose different options than they actually chose and that they show greater [[choice-supportive bias]] in memory for whichever option they believe they chose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Memory attributions for choices: How beliefs shape our memories |journal=Journal of Memory and Language |volume=57 |issue=2 |pages=163–176 |doi=10.1016/j.jml.2006.08.012 |ref=harv|last1=Henkel |first1=L |last2=Mather |first2=M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear, however, the extent to which these findings apply to real-life experience when we have more time to reflect or use actual faces (as opposed to gray-scale photos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=From Change Blindness to Choice Blindness |first1=Petter |last1=Johansson |first2=Lars |last2=Hall |first3=Sverker |last3=Sikstrom |journal=Psychologia |volume=51 |number=2 |year=2008 |pages=142–155 |url=http://www.lucs.lu.se/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Johansson-Hall-Sikstrom-2008-From-change-blindness-to-choice-blindness.pdf |doi=10.2117/psysoc.2008.142}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Prof. Kaszniak points out: "although ''a priori'' theories are an important component of people's causal explanations, they are not the sole influence, as originally hypothesized by Nisbett &amp; Wilson. Actors also have privileged information access that includes some degree of introspective access to pertinent causal stimuli and thought processes, as well as better access (than observers) to stimulus-response covariation data about their own behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ic.arizona.edu/ic/psyc358/358-Lect_6.htm |title=How well can we know ourselves? — Further Exploration of Introspection |last=Kaszniak |first=A.

Examples include people of many different non-open political ideologies, despite their enmity to each other, having a shared belief that it is "ethical" to give an appearance of humans justifying beliefs and "unethical" to admit that humans are open-minded in the absence of threats that inhibit critical thinking, making them fake justifications.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Swatridge (2014), "Oxford Guide to Effective Argument and Critical Thinking"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig P. Speelman, Marek McGann (2016), "Challenges to Mean-Based Analysis in Psychology: The Contrast Between Individual People and General Science"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitude change==

Studies that ask participants to introspect upon their [[reasoning]] (for liking, choosing, or believing something, etc.) tend to see a subsequent decrease in correspondence between attitude and behaviour in the participants.&lt;ref name="attitudebehavior"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Introspection, attitude change, and attitude-behavior consistency: The disruptive effects of explaining why we feel the way we do|volume=22|year=1989|pages=287–343|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60311-1|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|last1=Wilson|first1=Timothy D.|last2=Dunn|first2=Dana S.|last3=Kraft|first3=Dolores|last4=Lisle|first4=Douglas J.|isbn=9780120152223}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a study by Wilson ''et al.'', participants rated their interest in puzzles that they had been given. Prior to rating, one group had been instructed to contemplate and write down their reasons for liking or disliking the puzzles, while the control group was given no such task. The amount of time participants spent playing with each puzzle was then recorded. The correlation between ratings of and time spent playing each puzzle was much smaller for the introspection group than the control group.&lt;ref name="effectsofanalyzing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy|author2=D. Dunn |author3=J. Bybee |author4=D. Hyman |author5=J. Rotondo |title=Effects of analyzing reasons on attitude-behavior consistency|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1984|volume=47|pages=5–16|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent study was performed to show the generalizability of these results to more "realistic" circumstances. In this study, participants were all involved in a steady romantic relationship. All were asked to rate how well-adjusted their relationship was. One group was asked to list all of the reasons behind their feelings for their partner, while the control group did not do so. Six months later, the experimenters followed up with participants to check if they were still in the same relationship. Those who had been asked to introspect showed much less attitude-behaviour consistency based upon correlations between earlier relationship ratings and whether they were still dating their partners. This shows that introspection was not predictive, but this also probably means that the introspection has changed the evolution of the relationship.&lt;ref name=effectsofanalyzing/&gt;

The authors theorize that these effects are due to participants changing their attitudes, when confronted with a need for justification, without changing their corresponding behaviours. The authors hypothesize that this attitude shift is the result of a combination of things: a desire to avoid feeling foolish for simply not knowing why one feels a certain way; a tendency to make justifications based upon cognitive reasons, despite the large influence of emotion; ignorance of mental biases (e.g., halo effects); and self-persuasion that the reasons one has come up with must be representative with their attitude. In effect, people attempt to supply a "good story" to explain their reasoning, which often leads to convincing themselves that they actually hold a different belief.&lt;ref name=attitudebehavior/&gt; In studies wherein participants chose an item to keep, their subsequent reports of satisfaction with the item decreased, suggesting that their attitude changes were temporary, returning to the original attitude over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy|author2=D. Lisle |author3=J. Schooler |author4=S. Hodges |author5=K. Klaaren |author6=S. LaFleur |title=Introspecting about reasons can reduce post-choice satisfaction|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1993|volume=19|issue=3|pages=331–339|doi=10.1177/0146167293193010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introspection by focusing on feelings===
In contrast with introspection by focusing on reasoning, that which instructs one to focus on their [[feeling]]s has actually been shown to increase attitude-behaviour correlations.&lt;ref name=attitudebehavior/&gt; This finding suggests that introspecting on one's feelings is not a maladaptive process.

===Criticisms===

The theory that there are mental processes that act as justifications do not make behaviour more adaptive is criticized by some biologists who argue that the cost in nutrients for brain function selects against any brain mechanism that does not make behaviour more adapted to the environment. They argue that the cost in [[Nutrient#Essentiality|essential nutrients]] causes even more difficulty than the cost in calories, especially in social groups of many individuals needing the same scarce nutrients, which imposes substantial difficulty on feeding the group and lowers their potential size. These biologists argue that the evolution of argumentation was driven by the effectiveness of arguments on changing risk perception attitudes and life and death decisions to a more adaptive state, as "luxury functions" that did not enhance life and death survival would lose the evolutionary "tug of war" against the selection for nutritional thrift. While there have been claims of non-adaptive brain functions being selected by [[sexual selection]], these biologists criticize any applicability to introspection illusion's causal theories because sexually selected traits are most disabling as a fitness signal during or after puberty but human brains require the highest amount of nutrients before puberty (enhancing the nerve connections in ways that make adult brains capable of faster and more nutrient-efficient firing).&lt;ref&gt;Agustín González, Fernando Martinez-Garcia, Luis Puelles (2014), "Adaptive Function and Brain Evolution"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francisco J. Ayala, John C. Avise (2013), "In the Light of Evolution: Volume VI: Brain and Behavior"&lt;/ref&gt;

==''A priori'' causal theories==
In their classic paper, Nisbett and Wilson proposed that introspective confabulations result from ''a priori'' theories, of which they put forth four possible origins:&lt;ref name=tellingmore/&gt;
*Explicit cultural rules (e.g., stopping at red traffic lights)
*Implicit cultural theories, with certain schemata for likely stimulus-response relationships (e.g., an athlete only endorses a brand because he is paid to do so) 
*Individual observational experiences that lead one to form a theory of covariation
*Similar connotation between stimulus and response

The authors note that the use of these theories does not necessarily lead to inaccurate assumptions, but that this frequently occurs because the theories are improperly applied.

==Explaining biases==
Pronin argues that over-reliance on intentions is a factor in a number of different biases. For example, by focusing on their current good intentions, people can overestimate their likelihood of behaving virtuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pronin |first=Emily |date=January 2007 |title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |publisher= Elsevier |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=37–43 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001 |pmid=17129749 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In perceptions of bias===
{{Main|Bias blind spot}}
The [[bias blind spot]] is an established phenomenon that people rate themselves as less susceptible to bias than their peer group. Emily Pronin and Matthew Kugler argue that this phenomenon is due to the introspection illusion.&lt;ref name="gilovich"/&gt; In their experiments, subjects had to make judgments about themselves and about other subjects.&lt;ref name="blindspot"&gt;{{cite journal |date=July 2007 |title=Valuing thoughts, ignoring behavior: The introspection illusion as a source of the bias blind spot |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |publisher=Elsevier |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=565–578 |doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.011 |ref=harv|last1=Pronin |first1=Emily |last2=Kugler |first2=Matthew B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; They displayed standard biases, for example rating themselves above the others on desirable qualities (demonstrating [[illusory superiority]]). The experimenters explained cognitive bias, and asked the subjects how it might have affected their judgment. The subjects rated themselves as less susceptible to bias than others in the experiment (confirming the [[bias blind spot]]). When they had to explain their judgments, they used different strategies for assessing their own and others' bias.&lt;ref name="blindspot"/&gt;

Pronin and Kugler's interpretation is that when people decide whether someone else is biased, they use overt behaviour. On the other hand, when assessing whether or not they themselves are biased, people look inward, searching their own thoughts and feelings for biased motives. Since biases operate unconsciously, these introspections are not informative, but people wrongly treat them as reliable indication that they themselves, unlike other people, are immune to bias.&lt;ref name="gilovich"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilovich |first=Thomas |author2=Nicholas Epley |author3=Karlene Hanko  |title=The Self in Social Judgment |editor=Mark D. Alicke |editor2=David A. Dunning |editor3=Joachim I. Krueger |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |year=2005 |series=Studies in Self and Identity |page=77 |chapter=Shallow Thoughts About the Self: The Automatic Components of Self-Assessment |isbn=978-1-84169-418-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pronin and Kugler tried to give their subjects access to others' introspections. To do this, they made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they decided whether their answer to a previous question might have been affected by bias. Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers.&lt;ref name="blindspot"/&gt;

When asked what it would mean to be biased, subjects were more likely to define bias in terms of introspected thoughts and motives when it applied to themselves, but in terms of overt behaviour when it applied to other people. When subjects were explicitly told to avoid relying on introspection, their assessments of their own bias became more realistic.&lt;ref name="blindspot"/&gt;

Additionally, Nisbett and Wilson found that asking participants whether biases (such as the position effect in the stocking study){{clarify|date=January 2014}} had an effect on their decisions resulted in a negative response, in contradiction with the data.&lt;ref name=tellingmore/&gt;

===In perceptions of conformity===
Another series of studies by Pronin and colleagues examined perceptions of [[conformity]]. Subjects reported being more immune to social conformity than their peers. In effect, they saw themselves as being "alone in a crowd of sheep". The introspection illusion appeared to contribute to this effect. When deciding whether others respond to social influence, subjects mainly looked at their behaviour, for example explaining other student's political opinions in terms of following the group. When assessing their own conformity, subjects treat their own introspections as reliable. In their own minds, they found no motive to conform, and so decided that they had not been influenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Alone in a Crowd of Sheep: Asymmetric Perceptions of Conformity and Their Roots in an Introspection Illusion |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=92 |issue=4 |pages=585–595 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.4.585 |pmid=17469946 |ref=harv|author1=Pronin |first1=E |last2=Berger |first2=J |last3=Molouki |first3=S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In perceptions of control and free will===
{{see also|Neuroscience of free will}}
Psychologist [[Daniel Wegner]] has argued that an introspection illusion contributes to belief in [[paranormal]] phenomena such as [[psychokinesis]].&lt;ref name="selfismagic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wegner |first= Daniel M. |title=Are we free? Psychology and Free Will |editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor3=Roy F. Baumeister |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |year=2008 |chapter=Self is Magic |isbn= 978-0-19-518963-6 |chapter-url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic67047.files/2_13_07_Wegner.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; He observes that in everyday experience, intention (such as wanting to turn on a light) is followed by action (such as flicking a light switch) in a reliable way, but the processes connecting the two are not consciously accessible. Hence though subjects may feel that they directly introspect their own [[free will]], the experience of control is actually inferred from relations between the thought and the action. This theory, called "apparent mental causation", acknowledges the influence of [[David Hume]]'s view of the mind.&lt;ref name="selfismagic"/&gt; This process for detecting when one is responsible for an action is not totally reliable, and when it goes wrong there can be an [[illusion of control]]. This could happen when an external event follows, and is congruent with, a thought in someone's mind, without an actual causal link.&lt;ref name="selfismagic"/&gt;

As evidence, Wegner cites a series of experiments on [[magical thinking]] in which subjects were induced to think they had influenced external events. In one experiment, subjects watched a [[basketball]] player taking a series of [[free throws]]. When they were instructed to visualise him making his shots, they felt that they had contributed to his success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2006 |title=Everyday Magical Powers: The Role of Apparent Mental Causation in the Overestimation of Personal Influence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=218–231 |url=http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Pronin,%20Wegner,%20McCarthy,%20&amp;%20Rodriguez%20(2006).pdf |accessdate=2009-07-03 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.2.218 |pmid=16881760 |ref=harv |author1=Pronin |first1=E |last2=Wegner |first2=D. M. |last3=McCarthy |first3=K |last4=Rodriguez |first4=S |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105011719/http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~wegner/pdfs/Pronin%2C%20Wegner%2C%20McCarthy%2C%20%26%20Rodriguez%20%282006%29.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the introspection illusion contributes to the subjective feeling of free will, then it follows that people will more readily attribute free will to themselves rather than others. This prediction has been confirmed by three of Pronin and Kugler's experiments. When college students were asked about personal decisions in their own and their roommate's lives, they regarded their own choices as less predictable. Staff at a restaurant described their co-workers' lives as more determined (having fewer future possibilities) than their own lives. When weighing up the influence of different factors on behaviour, students gave desires and intentions the strongest weight for their own behaviour, but rated personality traits as most predictive of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pronin|2009|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
However, criticism of Wegner's claims regarding the significance of introspection illusion for the notion of free will has been published.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. criticism by H. Andersen in his paper with the title 'Two Causal Mistakes in Wegner's Illusion of Conscious Will' ; Also as a criticism, read "On the alleged illusion of conscious will' by Van Duijn and Sacha Bem. Other papers can be found).&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that human volunteers can estimate their response times accurately, in fact knowing their "mental processes" well, but only with substantial demands made on their attention and cognitive resources (i.e. they are distracted while estimating).

==Correcting for the bias==
A study that investigated the effect of educating people about unconscious biases on their subsequent self-ratings of susceptibility to bias showed that those who were educated did not exhibit the bias blind spot, in contrast with the control group. This finding provides hope that being informed about unconscious biases such as the introspection illusion may help people to avoid making biased judgments, or at least make them aware that they are biased. Findings from other studies on correction of the bias yielded mixed results. In a later review of the introspection illusion, Pronin suggests that the distinction is that studies that merely provide a warning of unconscious biases will not see a correction effect, whereas those that inform about the bias and emphasize its unconscious nature do yield corrections. Thus, knowledge that bias can operate during conscious awareness seems the defining factor in leading people to correct for it.&lt;ref name=introspectionillusion/&gt;

[[Timothy Wilson]] has tried to find a way out from "introspection illusion", recounted in his book ''Strangers to Ourselves.'' He suggests that the observation of our own behaviours more than our thoughts can be one of the keys for clearer introspective knowledge.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Criticisms===
{{Confusing section|date=July 2018}}
Some 21st century [[critical rationalism|critical rationalists]] argue that claims of correcting for introspection illusions or other cognitive biases pose a threat of immunizing themselves to criticism by alleging that criticism of psychological theories that claim cognitive bias are "justifications" for cognitive bias, making it [[falsifiability|non-falsifiable]] by labelling of critics and also potentially [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]]. These modern critical rationalists argue that a theory that defending a theory by claiming that it overcomes bias and alleging that critics are biased can defend any pseudoscience from criticism, that the claim that "criticism of A is a defense of B" is inherently incapable of being evidence-based and that any actual "most humans" bias (if it existed) would be shared by most psychologists and make psychology's claims of biases a way of accusing unbiased criticism of being biased and marketing the biases as overcoming of bias.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Sankey (2012), "After Popper, Kuhn and Feyerabend: Recent Issues in Theories of Scientific Method"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Sassower (2014), "Popper's Legacy: Rethinking Politics, Economics and Science"&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19380">'''Involuntary memory''', also known as '''involuntary explicit memory''', '''involuntary conscious memory''', '''involuntary aware memory''', and most commonly, '''involuntary autobiographical memory''', is a subcomponent of [[memory]] that occurs when cues encountered in everyday life evoke recollections of the past without conscious effort. Voluntary memory, its binary opposite, is characterized by a deliberate effort to recall the past.
[[Image:Dunking a biscuit.jpg|thumb|Tea biscuit dunking is one of many examples of cues that can elicit involuntary memories, as evidenced by [[Marcel Proust]].]]

==Occurrences==
There appear to be at least three different contexts within which involuntary memory arises, as described by J.H. Mace in his book ''Involuntary Memory''.&lt;ref name="Mace2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=John H. Mace|title=Involuntary memory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XzrqadWxAYcC|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-3638-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include those that occur in everyday life, those that occur during the processes of voluntary and involuntary recall, and those that occur as part of a psychiatric syndrome.

===Precious fragments===
These include involuntary memories as they arise in everyday mental functioning, comprising the most common occurrences. They are characterized by their element of surprise, as they appear to come into conscious awareness spontaneously. They are the products of common every-day experiences such as eating a piece of cake, bringing to mind a past experience evoked by the taste. The term "precious fragments" was coined by [[Marigold Linton]], a pioneer in the study of [[autobiographical memory]] research.

===By-products of other memories===
These are less common, and appear to be the result of voluntary/involuntary retrieval{{vague|date=November 2012}}. Characteristic of such occurrences is the triggering effect this has, as one involuntary memory leads to another and so on. Again, Linton describes her own experiences with such memories as "...coming unbidden sometimes when my mind is silent, but also as by-products of searches for other information".&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;

===Not so precious fragments===
Finally, some involuntary memories arise from traumatic experiences, and as such are fairly rare compared to other involuntary memories. Subjects describe them as salient, repetitive memories of traumatic events. The troubling nature of such memories makes these occurrences important to clinical researchers in their studies of psychiatric syndromes such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

==History==

===Hermann Ebbinghaus===
[[File:Ebbinghaus.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Herman Ebbinghaus (1850&amp;ndash;1909).]]

Born in Bremen, Germany in 1850, [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]] is recognized as the first to apply the principles of experimental psychology to studying memory. He is especially well known for his introduction and application of nonsense syllables in studying memory. Nonsense syllables are combinations of letters that do not follow grammatical rules, and are meant to lack any meaning. Ebbinghaus designed the use of them to study his own memory by memorizing lists of nonsense syllables and testing his own recall after specified time intervals. From this he discovered the [[forgetting curve]] and the [[spacing effect]], two of his most well-known contributions. Ebbinghaus was also the first to attempt a description of involuntary memory, stating that, 'Often, even after years, mental states once present in consciousness return to it with apparent spontaneity and without any act of the will; that is, they are reproduced involuntarily. Here, also, in the majority of cases we at once recognize the returned mental state as one that has already been experienced; that is, we remember it. Under certain conditions, however, this accompanying consciousness is lacking, and we know only indirectly that the "now" must be identical with the "then"; yet we receive in this way a no less valid proof for its existence during the intervening time. As more exact observation teaches us, the occurrence of these involuntary reproductions is not an entirely random and accidental one. On the contrary they are brought about through the instrumentality of other immediately present mental images. Moreover, they occur in certain regular ways that, in general terms, are described under the so-called ''laws of association''.'&lt;ref&gt;Ebbinghaus, H. (1885/1964). Memory: A contribution to experimental psychology, (trans. H.A. Ruger and C.E. Bussenius). Dover, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marcel Proust—Proustian memory===
[[File:Marcel Proust 1900-2.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Proust in 1900]]
[[Marcel Proust]] was the first person to coin the term involuntary memory, in his novel ''[[In Search of Lost Time|À la Recherche du Temps Perdu]]'' (''In Search of Lost Time'' or ''Remembrance of Things Past'').  Proust did not have any psychological background, and worked primarily as a writer.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, A. E. (2005). The contributions of Marcel Proust to psychoanalysis. Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry, 33(1), 137–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proust viewed involuntary memory as containing the "essence of the past", claiming that it was lacking from voluntary memory.  In his novel, he describes an incident where he was eating tea soaked cake, and a childhood memory of eating tea soaked cake with his aunt was "revealed" to him.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;  From this memory, he then proceeded to be reminded of the childhood home he was in, and even the town itself.  This becomes a theme throughout ''In Search of Lost Time'', with sensations reminding Proust of previous experiences.  He dubbed these "involuntary memories".

==Current research==

===Chaining===
One idea that has recently become the subject of studies on involuntary memory is chaining. This is the concept that involuntary memories have the tendency to trigger other involuntary memories that are related. Typically, it is thought to be the contents of involuntary memories that are related to one another, thereby causing the chaining effect.

In a diary study done by J.H Mace, participants reported that frequently, when one involuntary memory arose, it would quickly trigger a series of other involuntary memories. This was recognized as the cueing source for involuntary memories.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;

In work by Bernsten, the diary method was also applied to the study of involuntary memory chaining. The main hypothesis was that chaining would also occur on autobiographical memory tasks. Participants were asked to report the presence of involuntary memories while performing an autobiographical memory task. Results showed that participants did experience involuntary memory recall when they were recalling the past deliberately (also known as voluntary memory). This implies that involuntary memory production occurs as a product of chaining from voluntary memory—deliberate recall of the past.

===Priming===
A common question in the study of involuntary memory is related to priming; what is it that activates such a memory? Various studies have been conducted in recent years to observe the conditions under which involuntary memories are primed.

Mace, in one of his recent studies, wanted to test the notion that basic cognitive activities, such as thinking about the past, may prime involuntary memories. To test this idea, Mace set up a diary method study in which participants recorded involuntary memories they experienced during a two-week period, in a diary. During this two-week period, participants also had to come into a laboratory at intervals, and were instructed to recall memories from certain life periods (e.g., high school, first five years of marriage). Following this, comparing their involuntary memories to a control condition found that a significant number of their involuntary memories related to the time period they were instructed to recall. Such findings suggest that involuntary memories may be primed by even the simplest of cognitive tasks—namely, reminiscing and recalling the past.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt;

==Neurological basis==
[[File:Hippocampus.gif|thumb|right|The hippocampus is important for the successful retrieval of involuntary memories.]]
Research studies regarding the neurological functions of involuntary memory have been few in number. Thus far, only two neuroimaging studies have been conducted comparing involuntary memories to voluntary memories using [[Positron emission tomography|Positron Emission Tomography (PET)]].

The first study found that involuntary memory retrieval is mediated by the [[hippocampus]], which is known to be associated with successful episodic memory retrieval. In addition, activity in areas such as the left inferior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, and right superior occipital cortex, have been implicated in involuntary memory when dealing with involuntary word recognition tasks. Areas implicated with executive control processes such as right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and bilateral medial/lateral parietal cortex were more active during voluntary word recognition tasks.&lt;ref&gt;Rugg, M. D., Fletcher, P. C., Frith, C. D., J, R. S., &amp; Dolan, R. J. (1997). Brain regions supporting intentional and incidental memory: a PET study. NeuroReport (Oxford), 8 (5), 1283-1287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second study found that the medial temporal lobe, the posterior cingulate gyrus, and the precunueus, are activated during retrieval success with or without executive control seen within right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This implies that involuntary memories are successfully retrieved using the same system as voluntary memory when retrieving perceptual information. Voluntary and involuntary recall were both associated with increased activations in the posterior cingulated gyrus, left precuneus, and right parahippocampal gyrus. In addition, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and left precuneus were more active during voluntary recall, while left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was more active during involuntary recall. It is suggested that the activation seen in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during involuntary memory recall reflects the attempt to prevent the recollected material from interfering with the semantic judgment task.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, N. M., Gjedde, A., &amp; Kupers, R. (2008). Neural mechanisms of voluntary and involuntary recall : A PET study. Behavioural brain research, 186 (2), 261-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of age==

===Development===
While age plays a role in memory capabilities, it has been found that general strategies used to encode (to remember) memories is more important.&lt;ref&gt;Sophian, C., &amp; Hagen, J. W. (1978). Involuntary memory and the development of retrieval skills in young children. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 26 (3), 458–471.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those that are better at memorizing information are more likely to have more involuntary memories. 
 
In younger children (ages 10 and under), it has also been found that inducing involuntary memory during testing produced significantly better results than using voluntary memory.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, T. A. (1989). Developmental aspects of activating voluntary and involuntary memory processes during reading. [[Contemporary Educational Psychology]], 14 (1), 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be accomplished by posing a vague, mildly related question or sentence prior to the actual test question.  In older children (aged 14 and above), the opposite holds, with strictly voluntary memory leading to better test results.

===Reminiscence bump===
The [[reminiscence bump]] is the phenomenon where in memories formed during adolescence and early adulthood are more commonly remembered than those throughout other periods in life.  This is due to the formation of [[self-identity]]&lt;ref&gt;Conway, M. A., Wang, Q., Hanyu, K., &amp; Haque, S. (2005). A cross-cultural investigation of autobiographical memory. Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, 36, 739–749. {{doi|10.1177/0022022105280512}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the development of cognitive abilities across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, D. C., Rahhal, T. A., &amp; Poon, L. W. (1998). Things learned in early adulthood are remembered best. Memory &amp; Cognition, 26, 3-19. {{doi|10.3758/BF03211366}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Janssen, S. M. J., Kristo, G., Rouw, R., &amp; Murre, J. M. J. (2015). The relation between verbal and visuospatial memory and autobiographical memory. Consciousness and Cognition, 31, 12-23. {{doi|10.1016/j.concog.2014.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that this is true for both voluntary and involuntary memories.&lt;ref&gt;Schlagman, S., Kliegel, M., Schulz, J., &amp; Kvavilashvili, L. (2009). Differential effects of age on involuntary and voluntary autobiographical memory. Psychology and Aging, 24(2), 397–411. {{doi|10.1037/a0015785}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Age has been found to have a difference on the amount of memories recalled, but no age differences were found in the specificity of involuntary memories.

==The role of emotion==

===Emotion intensity===
[[Emotion]] plays a strong role in relation to [[emotion and memory|memory]].  It has been found that memories associated with stronger emotions (e.g.: being happy at your wedding) are more easily remembered and quickly recalled,&lt;ref&gt;D'Argembeau, A., &amp; Van der Linden, M. (2005). Influence of emotion on memory for temporal information. Emotion, 5(4), 503–507. {{doi|10.1037/1528-3542.5.4.503}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are those formed during moments of intense stress.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, N. M., &amp; Berntsen, D. (2008). The effect of emotional stress on involuntary and voluntary conscious memories. Memory, 16(1), 48–57.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same holds true for involuntary memories, with happy involuntary memories occurring twice as often as unhappy or neutral involuntary memories.&lt;ref&gt;Berntsen, D., &amp; Rubin, D. C. (2002). Emotionally charged autobiographical memories across the life span: The recall of happy, sad, traumatic and involuntary memories. Psychology and Aging, 17 (4), 636–652.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In clinical disorders==

===Posttraumatic stress disorder===
Often people who have been the victims of some type of trauma describe vivid memories that intrude on their thoughts spontaneously and without warning. Such mental intrusions, if maintained over time compose the hallmark symptom of [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)]].&lt;ref name="Berntsen2008"&gt;Berntsen, D., &amp; Rubin, D. C. (2008). The reappearance hypothesis revisited: Recurrent involuntary memories after traumatic events and in everyday life. Memory &amp; Cognition (pre-2012), 36 (2), 449-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]]'' defines a trauma as an event in which someone experiences, or witnesses' severe injury to themselves or others or a threat to their integrity. The person must also have responded with fear, helplessness or horror at the time of the trauma. The main psychological consequences of this include re-experiencing the traumatic event (through both intrusive thoughts and images), avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, and increased arousal levels.

When it comes to involuntary memory, researchers are mainly interested in the concept of these trauma-related intrusions, which generally involved some form of re-experiencing the event, including a sensory component (e.g., imagery in any modality be it visual, auditory etc.). These intrusions, often termed "[[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]]", make the victim feel as though they are reliving the trauma, and cause high levels of emotional arousal, and the sense of an impending threat. Typically, they are parts of the traumatic event that were most salient at the time, known as "hotspots" and have the definitive feature that they cause high levels of emotional distress, and may be difficult to recall deliberately. Although this is a defining feature of PTSD, intrusive memories are also frequently encountered in anxiety-based disorders, psychotic disorders and even within the general population.&lt;ref name=Berntsen2008/&gt; Regardless of the context in which they are encountered, intrusions tend to have the same central feature; that the stored information is being recalled involuntarily. It is thought that intrusions arise when an individual encounters stimuli similar to the stimuli that were processed and stored during the trauma, thus triggering the memory into the conscious mind.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt; A common example is one in which someone who has the victim of a car crash, upon hearing the screeching of tires experiences a flashback of their own collision, as if they are back at the original event.

===Psychosis===
Stressful and traumatic events, which may manifest as involuntary memories called ''flashbacks'', may trigger a wide range of anxiety-based and [[psychosis|psychotic]] disorders. [[Social phobia]],&lt;ref&gt;Hackmann, A., Clark, D. M., &amp; Mcmanus, F. (2000). Recurrent images and early memories in social phobia. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 38(6), 601–610.&lt;/ref&gt; [[bipolar disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;Mansell, W., &amp; Lam, D. (2004). A preliminary study of autobiographical memory in remitted bipolar and unipolar depression and the role of imagery in memory specificity. Memory, 12, 437–446.&lt;/ref&gt; [[major depressive disorder|depression]],&lt;ref&gt;Kuyken, W., &amp; Brewin, C. R. (1994). Stress and coping in depressed women. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 18(5), 403–412.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[agoraphobia]],&lt;ref&gt;Day, S. J., Holmes, E. A., &amp; Hackmann, A. (2004). Occurrence of imagery and its link with early memories in agoraphobia. Memory, 12, 416–427&lt;/ref&gt; are a few examples of disorders that have influences from flashbacks.

Psychosis is defined as a range of perceptual presentations, with the associated symptoms frequently referred to as either ''positive'' or ''negative''. Positive symptoms are delusional, and may include hallucinations, while negative symptoms are characterized by a "lack" of functioning, which may include a lack of affect (emotional feeling) and loss of motivation.&lt;ref name=Mace2007/&gt; One study found that there was a high prevalence of trauma in patients with severe mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;Mueser, K. T., Trumbettam S. L., Rosenberg, S. D., Vivader, R., Goodman, L. B., Osher, F. C., Auciello, P., &amp; Foy, D. W. (1998). Trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in severe mental illness. Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 66, 493–499.&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a small percentage had been diagnosed with PTSD when displaying PTSD-like symptoms. Therefore, the more complex symptoms of psychosis may prevent the clinical detection required when diagnosing PTSD. In addition, those who have been diagnosed with PTSD and have an identified form of trauma show positive symptoms of psychosis such as delusions and/or hallucinations.&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, S. E., Carlson, E. B., &amp; Sheikh, J. I. (2000). Psychotic symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder. CNS Spectrums, 5(9), 52-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it has been suggested that individuals suffering from psychosis may be more vulnerable to intrusions.&lt;ref&gt;Steel, C., Fowler, D., &amp; Holmes, E. A. (2005). Trauma-related intrusions and psychosis: An information processing account. Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy, 33(2), 139–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Lemnian deed''' is the cruel slaughter of someone as revenge. There are two possible origins for this term: the epic of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]], where [[Pelasgian Creation Myth|Pelasgian]] women killed their men, and that of Herodotus narrative where the Pelasgians killed captive mothers and children.

As is usual in other nationalistic [[Epic poetry|epics]] as well, other people and tribes are deemed to have barbaric tendencies. Besides, Pelasgians of [[Lemnos]] spoke pre-Greek [[Lemnian language|Lemnian]], and were technologically inferior (as can be seen from the weapons found in burials), which further promoted their primitive nature.

== Jasonian origin ==

It is said that Pelasgian women decided to kill their men, due to the men's cheating with the mainland Thracian women. In anger, the women slaughtered the men in their sleep and lived without men for many years, until [[Jason| Jason and the Argonauts]] arrived during [[Jason#The Quest for the Golden Fleece|The Quest for the Golden Fleece]].
They mingled with the women and created a new race: the [[Minyae]].

== Pelasgian origin ==

Michael Stewart relates the story of [[Herodotus]] thus:&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Michael. "People, Places &amp; Things: Lemnos", Greek Mythology: From the Iliad to the Fall of the Last Tyrant. http://messagenetcommresearch.com/myths/ppt/Lemnos_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The historian, Herodotus, relates the story that when the Pelasgians were driven from Attika (Attica) they kidnapped a number of Athenian women and took them to Lemnos; the women were defiant and taught their children to act and speak like Athenians; the Pelasgians would not accept such rebellious attitudes and killed the captive mothers and children and thus the term Lemnian Deeds became an enduring insult to the honor and manhood of the inhabitants.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Lifting diagram.png|right|thumb|100px|Lift of ''f'' ([[commutative diagram]])]] In the branch of [[mathematics]] called [[category theory]], given a [[morphism]] ''f'' from an object ''X'' to an object ''Y'', and a morphism ''g'' from an object ''Z'' to ''Y'', a '''lift''' or '''lifting''' of ''f'' to ''Z'' is a morphism ''h'' from ''X'' to ''Z'' such that ''f'' = ''g ∘ h''. We then say that ''f'' [[List of mathematical jargon#factor through|factors through]] ''h''. 

A basic example in [[topology]] is lifting a [[path (topology)|path]] in one space to a path in a [[covering space]]. Consider, for instance, mapping opposite points on a [[sphere]] to the same point, a continuous map from the sphere covering the [[projective plane]]. A path in the projective plane is a continuous map from the unit interval, [0,1]. We can lift such a path to the sphere by choosing one of the two sphere points mapping to the first point on the path, then maintain continuity. In this case, each of the two starting points forces a unique path on the sphere, the lift of the path in the projective plane. Thus in the category of topological spaces with continuous maps as morphisms, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 f\colon&amp; [0,1] \to \mathbb{RP}^2 , &amp;\qquad&amp;\text{(projective plane path)} \\
 g\colon&amp; S^2 \to \mathbb{RP}^2 , &amp;\qquad&amp;\text{(covering map)} \\
 h\colon&amp; [0,1] \to S^2 . &amp;\qquad&amp;\text{(sphere path)} 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Lifts are ubiquitous; for example, the definition of [[fibration]]s (see [[homotopy lifting property]]) and the valuative criteria of [[separated morphism|separated]] and [[proper map]]s of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] are formulated in terms of existence and (in the last case) [[Uniqueness theorem|uniqueness]] of certain lifts.

In [[algebraic topology]] and [[homological algebra]], [[tensor product]] and the [[Hom functor]] are [[tensor-hom adjunction|adjoint]]; however, they might not always lift to an [[exact sequence]]. This leads to the definition of the [[Ext functor]] and the [[Tor functor]].

This section of the [[list of rampage killers]] contains mass murders, committed by [[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone wolf perpetrators]], that have a foremost [[fundamentalism|religious]], [[racism|racial]] or political background.

A rampage killer has been defined as follows:
{{quote|A rampage involves the (attempted) killing of multiple persons least partly in public space by a single physically present perpetrator using (potentially) deadly weapons in a single event without any cooling-off period.&lt;ref&gt;Seeger, Thorsten (ed.) School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention; Springer, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
This list should contain every case with at least one of the following features:
* Rampage killings with 6 or more dead 
* Rampage killings with at least 4 people killed and least ten victims overall (dead plus injured)
* Rampage killings with at least 2 people killed and least 12 victims overall (dead plus injured)
* An incidence of rampage killing shall not be included in this list if it does not include at least two people killed.
* In all cases the perpetrator(s) are not counted among those killed or injured.

All abbreviations used in the table are explained [[#Abbreviations and footnotes|below]]. &lt;!--Additions should be made 1) in order of # of fatalities, and 2) # injured--&gt;

'''''Literaturwurst''''' (''Literature Sausage'') is an [[Artist's book]],&lt;ref&gt;Considered a book by Roth, and included in lists Roth made cataloguing his work, as quoted in Dieter Roth Books + Multiples, Dobke, Hansjörg Mayer, 2004 p154&lt;/ref&gt;  made by the Swiss-German artist [[Dieter Roth]] between 1961 and 1974. Each book was made using traditional [[sausage]] recipes, but replacing the sausage meat with a book or magazine. The cover of the edition was then pasted onto the skin of the sausage and signed and dated.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'When I was young I wanted to become a real artist. Then I started doing something I felt wasn't real art, and it was through this that I became a well-known artist.' Dieter Roth&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03E4DB123AF933A25755C0A96E958260 Dieter Roth, Quoted in the New York Times Obituary], 10-06-1998&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Processing text==
Roth made the first Literature Sausage from a copy of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', whilst living in [[Iceland]],&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Rot, Books and Graphics, Arts Council of Great Britain, 1973, p9&lt;/ref&gt; and gave it to his friend and colleague [[Daniel Spoerri]] in 1961. This makes it contemporaneous with his book ''Daily Mirror'' that Roth constructed this year, and was part of a series of books that used found printed matter, such as comics and off-set run up sheets, and rebound them to disrupt their visual authority.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“From time to time I take books I can’t stand or from authors I want to annoy and make: sausages c. 40 cm long, 8 cm thick, should end up as an edition of 50, titled on the outside, signed, numbered, DM100.”&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Roth to Hanns Sohm, spring 1964, quoted in Dieter Roth Books + Multiples, Dobke, Hansjörg Mayer, 2004, p9&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1963, after realizing the sausage had “ironic value”&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Wien 2002, p48, quoted in Dieter Roth Books + Multiples, Dobke, Hansjörg Mayer, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; he offered the book to [[George Maciunas]] to be published as a [[Fluxus]] Edition via mutual friend Arthur Kopke. Maciunas turned down the idea, although Roth still participated in a number of early Fluxus events. He returned to the idea in 1966, producing 24 over the next few years, using books such as ''Tin Drum'' by [[Günter Grass]], ''[[To Seek a Newer World]]'' by [[Robert Kennedy]] and ''The Redhead'' by [[Alfred Andersch]]. Uniquely, ''Halbzeit'' (Half-time by [[Martin Walser]]), was cut into unequal halves and hung in a deeply recessed picture frame.

===Expansion of the series===
In 1970 the series was expanded to include magazines; ''[[Quick (German magazine)|Quick]],'' ''[[Bunte]]'', ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' and ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]''. These last 25 were manufactured by Editions Rene Block, Berlin, and stuffed into plastic skins rather than intestine.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"If you follow these instructions carefully i shall give you these two sausages to sell and soil and slice and save and save and do whatever else you wish without restriction! so; (don't be or get angry now) get a recipe from a butcher a recipe for sausages and follow this recipe (exactly), so that everything in the recipe that is not MEAT, in the doug or the mass (whatever that's called) included- spices, water, gelatine, onions, garlic etc etc; PUT IT ALL IN, and then in place of meat use the pages of the book!"&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Hanns Sohm, 1964, quoted in Dieter Roth Books + Multiples, Dobke, Hansjörg Mayer, 2004, p9&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Foodstuffs as art===
The book was to become the first of a large series of pieces by Roth that used foodstuffs, occasionally preserved, more usually rotting, such as ''Porträt Carl Laszlo'' 1963, in which a portrait of a collector is covered in cheese and chocolate, and ''P.O.TH.A.A.VFB'', a [[self-portrait]] multiple made of [[chocolate]] and [[birdseed]], at least one of which was left out on a bird-table, to be eaten by birds.

The most notorious was the ''Staple Cheese (A Chase)'' exhibition at the Eugenia Butler Gallery, [[Los Angeles]], 1970. This consisted of a series of suitcases filled with cheese, as well as wall mounted cheese intended to drip over a horizontal line below. A different case was opened each day to reveal different states of decay. In less than three weeks, the gallery was 'practically impossible to enter'&lt;ref&gt;Roth Time A Dieter Roth Retrospective, Dobke, Lars Muller, 2004, p130&lt;/ref&gt; with prospective viewers having to contend with flies, larvae and maggots as well as the smell. The suitcases remained unsold, and were finally thrown away in the desert by the dealer's husband.

=== Culmination of the Series: Hegel's Collected Works ===
The series culminated in 1974 with ''[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]’s Werke in 20 Bänden'' (''Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s Work in 20 Volumes''), made by the collector [[Hanns Sohm]] according to Roth’s instructions. The 20 sausages are hung on two rows on a wooden frame, ‘as in a slaughterhouse.’&lt;ref&gt;Roth Time, Dobke &amp; Walter, Lars Müller, 2004, p74&lt;/ref&gt;

Roth would also publish some of the sausage’s recipes, listing the ingredients used, in ''Gesammelte Werke'', (Collected Works) Vol 16.

'''Micha Popper''' is a [[professor emeritus]] in the department of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Haifa]], [[Israel]].  He was the commander of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) Leadership Development School (LDS), co-founder and director of the Institute for Quality Leadership in Israel, and, from 1995 he was a faculty member and head of the [[Organizational Psychology]] program at the University of Haifa.  

==Biography==
Popper received his BA in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and his MA and PhD in [[Tel Aviv University]]. 

==Research areas== 
At the beginning of his research career Popper focused on exploring the origins of leadership in early childhood. Most knowledge in this field is inferred from biographies and studies (based mostly on psycho-dynamic analyses) of well-known people. His  work in this field led him to formulate a conceptual framework dealing with three components relevant to being and functioning as a leader: (1) the psychological potential to lead (P); (2) the motivation to be in a leadership position (M); (3) the environment (e.g. role models, accessibility to leadership experiences...), namely the developmental component (D). Popper and his colleagues have contributed to the identification, definition, evaluation and measurement of each of these components&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Popper, M., Amit, K., Gal, R., Sinai, M. &amp; Lissak, A. (2004). The capacity to lead: Major psychological differences between “leaders” and “non-leaders”. Military Psychology 16, 4, 245-263).&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In his later career, Popper observed that in the Western world, particularly the US, leadership was usually perceived as a positive phenomenon and leaders were socially respected, often even admired. However, history also points to dark manifestations of leadership. This aspect has been discussed by historians but largely neglected in psychological research on leadership. Popper’s work sheds light on the psychological foundations of the dark side of leadership&lt;ref&gt;see e.g., Popper, M. (2001). Hypnotic Leadership. Westport, CT: Prager.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
The continuation of Popper’s professional development led him to realize that psychological research on leadership was excessively preoccupied with leaders and there were not enough theoretical and empirical attempts to decipher the phenomenon of followership, without which the phenomenon of leadership cannot be fully understood. 

In recent years Popper’s work has focused on  primary foundations of followership,  both the phylogenetic elements and  the cultural components that “color” differently leaders’ perceptions and images in various cultures. &lt;ref&gt;Examples of this approach are Popper, M. (2012). Fact and fantasy about leadership. London: Edward Elgar; Popper, M., Castelnovo, O. (2017).The function of great leaders in human culture: A cultural-evolutionary perspective. Leadership, on line, of August, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;.
In addition to his work in the domain of leadership, for many years Popper has also studied the field of “[[organizational learning]].” His work in this area has focused mostly on two questions:.How do people learn from their own experiences?  and, how do lessons learned on a personal level become organizational knowledge? 

The first question involves the development of concepts and methodologies for identifying “tacit knowledge” – knowledge created out of experience without awareness. Such knowledge is at the disposal of people when solving problems (as Polanyi puts it:” We know more than we can tell”). 
The second question led Popper and his colleagues to study the structural and cultural aspects that characterize effective learning in organizations. These studies focused on organizational learning mechanisms such as debriefing of air force pilots or debriefing of medical staff performing operatrions&lt;ref&gt;The structural-cultural approach to organizational learning is presented in Lipshitz, R., Friedman, V. &amp; Popper, M. (2007). Demystifying Organizational Learning. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Montrose Madison Wolf''' (May 29, 1935 – March 19, 2004) was an American psychologist. He developed the technique of "[[Child time-out|time-out]]" as a learning tool to shape behavior in children in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Risley, Todd (2005), [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1226164 "Montrose M.

He created the [[Teaching Family Model]] as an intervention program for dealing with juvenile delinquents. He helped replicate this model almost 800 times. &lt;ref&gt; Fixsen, D.L., Blasé, K, Timbers, G.D. and Wolf, M.M.

[[Image:Narcissus-Caravaggio (1594-96) edited.jpg|thumb|''[[Narcissus (Caravaggio)|Narcissus]]'' (1590s) by [[Caravaggio]] ([[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], [[Rome]])]]
'''Narcissism''' is the pursuit of gratification from [[vanity]] or [[egotistic]] admiration of one's idealised self image and attributes. The term originated from [[Greek mythology]], where the young [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] fell in love with his own image reflected in a pool of water. Narcissism is a  concept in [[psychoanalytic theory]], which was popularly introduced in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s essay ''[[On Narcissism]]'' (1914). The [[American Psychiatric Association]] has listed the classification [[narcissistic personality disorder]] in its ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) since 1968, drawing on the historical concept of [[megalomania]].

Narcissism is also considered a social or cultural problem.
It is a factor in [[trait theory]] used in various [[self-report inventory|self-report inventories]] of personality such as the [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory]]. It is one of the three [[dark triad]]ic personality traits (the others being [[psychopathy]] and [[Machiavellianism]]). Except in the sense of [[primary narcissism]] or [[Healthy narcissism|healthy self-love]], narcissism is usually considered a problem in a person's or group's relationships with self and others. Narcissism is not the same as [[egocentrism]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of narcissism}}
[[File:Sisyphus Pushing His Stone up a Mountain (486x640).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The myth of [[Sisyphus]] tells about a man punished for his  [[hubris]]tic belief that his cleverness surpassed that of Zeus himself. He has to push a stone up a mountain each day, only to have to recommence the task on the next day.]]
The term "narcissism" comes  from the Greek myth about [[Narcissus (mythology)|Narcissus]] ({{lang-grc-gre|Νάρκισσος}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|Narkissos}}''), a handsome Greek youth who, according to [[Ovid]], rejected the desperate advances of the nymph [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]]. This caused Narcissus to fall in love with his own reflection in a pool of water. Unable to consummate his love, Narcissus "lay gazing enraptured into the pool, hour after hour," and finally changed into a flower that bears his name, the [[Narcissus (plant)|narcissus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Symington|first=Neville|title=Narcissism: A New Theory|year=1993|publisher=H.

A 2012 book on [[Abusive power and control|power-hungry]] narcissists suggests that narcissists typically display most, and sometimes all, of the following traits:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Thomas|first = David|title = Narcissism: Behind the Mask|date=2012|isbn =184624935X|publisher = Book Guild Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An obvious self-focus in interpersonal exchanges
* Problems in sustaining satisfying relationships
* A lack of psychological awareness (see [[insight in psychology and psychiatry]],  [[egosyntonic]])
* Difficulty with [[empathy]]
* Problems distinguishing the self from others (see [[personal boundaries]])
* Hypersensitivity to any insults or imagined [[insults]] (see [[Criticism#Psychopathology|criticism psychopathology]], [[narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury]])
* [[Vulnerability]] to [[shame]] rather than [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]
* Haughty [[body language]]
* [[Flattery]] towards people who admire and affirm them ([[narcissistic supply]])
* Detesting those who do not admire them ([[narcissistic abuse]])
* Using other people without considering the cost of doing so
* Pretending to be more important than they actually are
* [[Bragging]] (subtly but persistently) and [[exaggerating]] their achievements
* Claiming to be an "expert" at many things
* Inability to view the world from the perspective of other people
* [[Denial]] of [[remorse]] and [[gratitude]]

These criteria have been criticized because they presume a knowledge of intention (for example, the phrase "pretending to be").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Readings_in_Philosophy_of_Psychology.html?id=cgsOAAAAQAAJ|title=Readings in Philosophy of Psychology|first=Ned Joel|last=Block|date=22 October 1980|publisher=Methuen|accessdate=22 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavior is observable, but intention is not. Thus classification requires assumptions which need to be tested before they can be asserted as fact, especially considering multiple explanations could be made as to why a person exhibits these behaviors.

=== Seven deadly sins of narcissism ===
The US psychiatrists Hotchkiss and [[James F. Masterson]] identified what they called the seven deadly sins of narcissism:&lt;ref&gt;Hotchkiss, Sandy &amp; [[James F. Masterson|Masterson, James F.]] Why Is It Always About You?: The Seven Deadly Sins of Narcissism (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Shame]]lessness: Narcissists are often proudly and openly shameless; they are not bound by the needs and wishes of others. Narcissists hate shame, and consider it "toxic", as shame implies they are not perfect and need to change. Narcissists prefer guilt over shame, as guilt allows them to dissociate their actions from themselves - it's only their actions that are wrong, while they themselves remain perfect.
# [[Magical thinking]]: Narcissists see themselves as perfect, using [[Cognitive distortion|distortion]] and illusion known as [[magical thinking]]. They also use [[psychological projection|projection]] to "dump" shame onto others.
# [[Hubris|Arrogance]]: A narcissist who is feeling deflated may "reinflate" their sense of self-importance by diminishing, debasing, or degrading somebody else.
# [[Envy]]: A narcissist may secure a sense of superiority in the face of another person's ability by using contempt to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the other person or their achievements.
# [[Entitlement]]: Narcissists hold unreasonable expectations of particularly favorable treatment and automatic compliance because they consider themselves special. Failure to comply is considered an attack on their superiority, and the perpetrator is considered an "awkward" or "difficult" person. Defiance of their will is a narcissistic injury that can trigger [[narcissistic rage]].
# [[wikt:exploit|Exploitation]]: Can take many forms but always involves the exploitation of others without regard for their feelings or interests. Often the other person is in a subservient position where resistance would be difficult or even impossible. Sometimes the subservience is not so much real as assumed.
# [[Personal boundaries|Bad boundaries]]: Narcissists do not recognize that they have boundaries and that others are separate and are not extensions of themselves. Others either exist to meet their needs or may as well not exist at all. Those who provide [[narcissistic supply]] to the narcissist are treated as if they are part of the narcissist and are expected to live up to those expectations. In the mind of a narcissist, there is no boundary between self and other.

NPD was revised in the [[DSM-5]]. The general move towards a dimensional (personality trait-based) view of the Personality Disorders has been maintained. Some narcissists may have a limited or minimal capability to experience emotions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=NSyiH7xM7FQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=&amp;ots=fifDbBTb3o&amp;sig=xPh6nNAnxBozgtlwiwm2jrdKFCI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Psychodynamic Psychotherapy for Personality Disorders: A Clinical Handbook] Narcissistic personality disorder, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Required element within normal development ====
Karen Horney saw the narcissistic personality as a temperament trait molded by a certain kind of early environment. She did not see narcissistic needs and tendencies as inherent in human nature.&lt;ref name=horney1&gt;Paris, Bernard J, ''Personality and Personal Growth'', edited by Robert Frager and James Fadiman, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Malkin called a lack of healthy narcissism "echoism" after [[Echo (mythology)|the nymph Echo]] in the mythology of Narcissus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rethinking Narcissism: The Bad-and Surprising Good-About Feeling Special|author=Craig Malkin|isbn=978-0062348104|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy narcissism might exist in all individuals.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="freud1" /&gt;--&gt;

[[Freud]] said that narcissism was an original state from which the individual develops the love object.&lt;ref name="Nagera"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Narcissism (pp. 107ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=_tcUbPPdf8AC&amp;pg=PA107 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Libido Theory |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tcUbPPdf8AC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2012 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=iD1qAAAAMAAJ 1969] |publisher=Karnac Books |location=London |isbn=1-78181098-2 |id={{ISBN|978-1-781-81098-9}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qualify evidence}}&lt;!-- Has this theory been debunked or is it currently accepted by mainstream psychologists? --&gt; He argued that healthy narcissism is an essential part of normal development.&lt;ref name="freud1" /&gt; According to Freud, the love of the parents for their child and their attitude toward their child could be seen as a revival and reproduction of their own narcissism.&lt;ref name="freud1" /&gt; The child has a megalomaniac [[omnipotence]] of thought;&lt;ref name="Nagera"/&gt; the parents stimulate that feeling because in their child they see the things that they have never reached themselves. Compared to neutral observers, parents tend to overvalue the qualities of their child. When parents act in an extreme opposite style and the child is rejected or inconsistently reinforced depending on the mood of the parent, the self-needs of the child are not met.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Freud contrasted the natural development of active-egoistic and passive-altruistic tendencies in the individual with narcissism, in the former, and what Trevor Pederson referred to as echoism, in the latter.&lt;ref name="Libido 2015"&gt;The Economics of Libido: Psychic Bisexuality, the Superego, and the Centrality of the Oedipus Complex (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{block quote|This is the place for two remarks. First, how do we differentiate between the concepts of narcissism and egoism? Well, narcissism, I believe, is the libidinal complement to egoism. When we speak of egoism, we have in view only the individual's advantage; when we talk of narcissism we are also taking his libidinal satisfaction into account. As practical motives the two can be traced separately for quite a distance. It is possible to be absolutely egoistic and yet maintain powerful object-cathexes, in so far as libidinal satisfaction in relation to the object forms part of the ego's needs. In that case, egoism will see to it that striving for the object involves no damage to the ego. It is possible to be egoistic and at the same time to be excessively narcissistic—that is to say, to have very little need for an object, whether, once more, for the purpose of direct sexual satisfaction, or in connection with the higher aspirations, derived from sexual need, which we are occasionally in the habit of contrasting with 'sensuality' under the name of 'love'. In all these connections egoism is what is self-evident and constant, while narcissism is the variable element. The opposite to egoism, altruism, does not, as a concept, coincide with libidinal object-cathexis, but is distinguished from it by the absence of longings for sexual satisfaction. When someone is completely in love, however, altruism converges with libidinal object-cathexis. As a rule the sexual object attracts a portion of the ego's narcissism to itself, and this becomes noticeable as what is known as the 'sexual overvaluation' of the object. If in addition there is an altruistic transposition of egoism on to the sexual object, the object becomes supremely powerful; it has, as it were, absorbed the ego." (Freud, ''Introductory Lectures'' (1919), pp. 417–18)}}

Where the egoist can give up love in narcissism, the altruist can give up on competition, or "the will," in echoism. The individual first has a non-ambivalent relations of ''fusion'' with authority or love figures, which are characterized by the egoistic or altruistic drives. Second, the individual can move to ''defusion'' from authority or love figures which leads to repetitions of ambivalent, narcissistic or echoistic relations. In the third movement the individual becomes the dead or absent parental figure that never returned love to the echoist, or the perfect, grandiose parental figure in narcissism.&lt;ref name="Libido 2015"/&gt; While egoism and narcissism concern dynamics of power and inferiority/superiority, Pederson argues that altruism and echoism concern dynamics of belonging and inclusion/exclusion. Pederson has two types of echoists: the "subject altruist" and the "object altruist", with the former being concerned with the belonging of others and loving them, and the latter being concerned with their own belonging and being loved. The subject altruist is self-effacing, a people pleaser, and sacrifices her desire to help others who are outsiders become insiders, or to be the submissive helper of an insider. The object altruist is gregarious, a people person, and wants to be interesting which is based on wanting to fit in and not be an outsider or wanting to be unique as an insider. Both types of echoists show issues with being submissive, having problems saying no, and avoiding conflict.&lt;ref name="Libido 2015"/&gt;

==== In relation to the pathological condition ====
Healthy narcissism has to do with a strong feeling of "own love" protecting the human being against illness. Eventually, however, the individual must love the other, "the object love to not become ill". The individual becomes ill as a result of the frustration created when he is unable to love the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psywilly.be/index.php?page=lezingen|title=Psywilly.be, psychoanalyticus Willy Depecker|first=Stijn|last=Blomme|website=www.psywilly.be|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2018}} In pathological narcissism such as the [[narcissistic personality disorder]], the person's libido has been withdrawn from objects in the world and produces [[megalomania]]. The clinical theorists [[Kernberg]], [[Kohut]] and [[Theodore Millon]] all saw pathological narcissism as a possible outcome in response to unempathic and inconsistent early childhood interactions. They suggested that narcissists try to compensate in adult relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/S15327965PLI1204_1 |author=Morf, Caroline C.|author2=Rhodewalt, Frederick |author2link= Frederick Rhodewalt|title=Unraveling the Paradoxes of Narcissism: A Dynamic Self-Regulatory Processing Model |journal=Psychological Inquiry |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=177–96 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathological condition of narcissism is, as Freud suggested, a magnified, extreme manifestation of healthy narcissism.

Healthy narcissism has been suggested to be correlated with good psychological health. [[Self-esteem]] works as a mediator between narcissism and psychological health. Therefore, because of their elevated self-esteem, deriving from self-perceptions of competence and likability, high narcissists are relatively free of worry and gloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.400 |author=Sedikides, C.|author2=Rudich, E.A.|author3=Gregg, A.P.|author4=Kumashiro, Ml|author5=Rusbult, C. |title=Are Normal Narcissists Psychologically Healthy?: self-esteem matters |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=87 |pages=400–16 |year=2004 |issue=3 |pmid=15382988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have suggested that healthy narcissism cannot be seen as 'good' or 'bad', but that it depends on the contexts and outcomes being measured. In certain social contexts such as initiating social relationships, and with certain outcome variables, such as feeling good about oneself, healthy narcissism can be helpful. In other contexts, such as maintaining long-term relationships and with outcome variables, such as accurate self-knowledge, healthy narcissism can be unhelpful.&lt;ref name = caf&gt;{{cite book|last1= Campbell|first1 = W.

=== Commonly used measures ===

==== Narcissistic Personality Inventory ====
{{Main|Narcissistic Personality Inventory}}
The Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) is the most widely used measure of narcissism in social psychological research. Although several versions of the NPI have been proposed in the literature, a forty-item forced-choice version (Raskin &amp; Terry, 1988) is the one most commonly employed in current research. The NPI is based on the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]-III clinical criteria for narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), although it was designed to measure these features in the general population. Thus, the NPI is often said to measure "normal" or "subclinical" (borderline) narcissism (i.e., in people who score very high on the NPI do not necessarily meet criteria for diagnosis with NPD).

==== Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory ====
{{Main|Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory}}
The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI) is a widely used diagnostic test developed by [[Theodore Millon]]. The MCMI includes a scale for Narcissism. The NPI and MCMI have been found to be well correlated, ''r''(146)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.55, ''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4806_13 |author=Auerbach JS |title=Validation of two scales for narcissistic personality disorder |journal=J Pers Assess |volume=48 |issue=6 |pages=649–53 |date=December 1984 |pmid=6520692 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the MCMI measures narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), the NPI measures narcissism as it occurs in the general population. In other words, the NPI measures "normal" narcissism; i.e., most people who score very high on the NPI do not have NPD. Indeed, the NPI does not capture any sort of narcissism taxon as would be expected if it measured NPD.&lt;ref name="foster1"&gt;Foster, J.D., &amp; Campbell, W.K., Are there such things as "narcissists" in social psychology? A taxometric analysis of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Empirical studies ===
Within the field of [[psychology]], there are two main branches of research into narcissism: (1) clinical and (2) social psychology.

These two approaches differ in their view of narcissism, with the former treating it as a disorder, thus as discrete, and the latter treating it as a [[personality trait]], thus as a ''continuum''. These two strands of research tend loosely to stand in a divergent relation to one another, although they converge in places.

Campbell and Foster (2007)&lt;ref name="caf"/&gt; review the literature on narcissism. They argue that narcissists possess the following "basic ingredients":
* Positive: Narcissists think they are better than others.&lt;ref name="cras"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/0146167202286007 |author=Campbell, W. K.|author2=Rudich, E.|author3=Sedikides, C. |title=Narcissism, [[self esteem]], and the positivity of self views: Two portraits of ''self-love'' |journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin |volume=28 |pages=358–68 |year=2002 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inflated: Narcissists' views tend to be contrary to reality. In measures that compare self-report to objective measures, narcissists' self-views tend to be greatly [[exaggerated]].&lt;ref name="get"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00798.x |author=Gabriel, M. T.|author2=Critelli, J. W.|author3=Ee, J. S. |title=Narcissistic illusions in self-evaluations of intelligence and attractiveness |journal=[[Journal of Personality]]  |volume=62 |pages=143–55 |year=1994 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Agentic: Narcissists' views tend to be most exaggerated in the [[agentic]] domain, relative to the communion domain.{{Clarify|date=August 2011}}&lt;ref name="cras" /&gt;&lt;ref name="get" /&gt;
* Special: Narcissists perceive themselves to be unique and special people.&lt;ref name="emmons"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327752jpa4803_11 |pmid=16367528 |author=Emmons, R.A. |title=Factor analysis and construct validity of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory |journal=Journal of Personality Assessment |volume=48 |pages=291–300 |year=1984 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Selfish: Research upon narcissists' behaviour in resource dilemmas supports the case for narcissists as being [[selfish]].&lt;ref name="cbbs"&gt;Campbell, W. K., Bush, C. P., Brunell, A. B., &amp; Shelton, J. (in press). Understanding the social costs of narcissism: The case of tragedy of the commons. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oriented toward success: Narcissists are oriented towards success by being, for example, approach oriented.{{Clarify|date=August 2011}}&lt;ref name="cr"&gt;Rose, P. &amp; Campbell, W. K. (in press). Greatness feels good: A telic model of narcissism and subjective well-being. Advances in Psychology Research. Serge P. Shohov (Ed.) Hauppauge, NY: Nova Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narcissists tend to demonstrate a lack of interest in warm and caring interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="caf"/&gt; There are several ongoing controversies within narcissism literature, namely: whether narcissism is healthy or unhealthy; a [[personality disorder]]; a discrete or continuous variable; defensive or offensive; the same across genders; the same across cultures; and changeable or unchangeable.

Campbell and Foster (2007) argue that [[Self control|self-regulatory]] strategies are of paramount importance to understanding narcissism.&lt;ref name="caf" /&gt; Self-regulation in narcissists involves such things as striving to make one's self look and feel positive, special, successful and important. It comes in both intra-psychic, such as blaming a situation rather than self for failure, and interpersonal forms, such as using a relationship to serve one's own self. Some differences in self-regulation between narcissists and non-narcissists can be seen with Campbell, Reeder, Sedikides &amp; Elliot (2000)&lt;ref name="cre"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jrpe.2000.2282 |author=Campbell, W.K.|author2=Reeder G.D.|author3=Sedikides, C.|author4=Elliot, A.J. |title=Narcissism and Comparative Self-Enhancement Strategies |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume=34 |pages=329–47 |year=2000 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who conducted a study with two experiments. In each experiment, participants took part in an achievement task, following which they were provided with false feedback; it was either bogus success or failure. The study found that both narcissists and non-narcissists self-enhanced, but non-narcissists showed more flexibility in doing so. Participants were measured on both a comparative and a non-comparative [[self-enhancement]] strategy. Both narcissists and non-narcissists employed the non-comparative strategy similarly; however, narcissists were found to be more self-serving with the comparative strategy, employing it far more than non-narcissists, suggesting a greater rigidity in their self-enhancement. When narcissists receive negative feedback that threatens the self, they self-enhance at all costs, but non-narcissists tend to have limits.

Sorokowski et al. (2015) showed that narcissism is related to the frequency of posting [[selfie]]-type pictures on [[social media]]. Sorokowski's study showed that this relationship was stronger among men than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sorokowski | first1 = P | last2 = Sorokowska | first2 = A | last3 = Oleszkiewicz | first3 = A | last4 = Frackowiak | first4 = T | last5 = Huk | first5 = A | last6 = Pisanski | first6 = K| year = 2015| title = Selfie posting behaviors are associated with narcissism among men | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915003256 | journal = Pers Individ Dif | volume = 85 | issue = | pages = 123–27 | doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heritability research using twin studies ===
Livesley et al. concluded, in agreement with other studies, that narcissism as measured by a standardized test was a common inherited trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Livesley WJ, Jang KL, Jackson DN, Vernon PA |title=Genetic and environmental contributions to dimensions of personality disorder |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=150 |issue=12 |pages=1826–31 |date=December 1993 |pmid=8238637 |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8238637 |doi=10.1176/ajp.150.12.1826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in similar agreement with those other studies, it was found that there exists a continuum between normal and disordered personality. The study subjects were 175 volunteer twin pairs (ninety identical, eighty-five fraternal) drawn from the general population. Each twin completed a questionnaire that assessed eighteen dimensions of personality disorder. The authors estimated the [[heritability]] of each dimension of personality by standard methods, thus providing estimates of the relative contributions of [[genetics|genetic]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] causation. Of the eighteen personality dimensions, narcissism was found to have the highest heritability (0.64), indicating that the [[Concordance (genetics)|concordance]] of this trait in the [[identical twins]] was significantly influenced by genetics. Of the other dimensions of personality, only four were found to have heritability coefficients of greater than 0.5: [[Callous and unemotional traits|callousness]], identity problems, oppositionality and social avoidance.

=== Stigmatising attitude towards psychiatric illness ===
Arikan found that a [[Social stigma|stigmatising]] attitude to [[psychiatric]] patients is associated with narcissistic personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arikan, K. |title=A stigmatizating attitude towards psychiatric illnesses is associated with narcissistic personality traits |journal=Isr J Psychiatry Relat Sci |volume=42  |issue=4 |pages=248–50 |year=2005 |pmid=16618057}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In evolutionary psychology ===
The concept of narcissism is used in [[evolutionary psychology]] in relation to the mechanisms of [[assortative mating]], or the non-random choice of a partner for purposes of procreation. Evidence for assortative mating among humans is well established; humans mate assortatively regarding age, IQ, height, weight, nationality, educational and occupational level, physical and personality characteristics, and family relatedness.&lt;ref&gt;Buston &amp; Emlen 2003, Buss 1989, Epstein &amp; Guttman 1984, Garrison et al. 1968, Ho 1986, Jaffe &amp; Chacon 1995, Spuhler 1968, Rushton 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In the "self seeking like" hypothesis, individuals unconsciously look for a "mirror image" of themselves in others, seeking criteria of beauty or reproductive fitness in the context of self-reference. Alvarez et al. found that facial resemblance between couples was a strong driving force among the mechanisms of assortative mating: human couples resemble each other significantly more than would be expected from random pair formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alvarez, L. |title=Narcissism guides mate selection: Humans mate assortatively, as revealed by facial resemblance, following an algorithm of 'self seeking like' |journal=Evolutionary Psychology |volume=2 |pages=177–94 |year=2005 |url=http://human-nature.com/ep/articles/ep02177194.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618224549/http://human-nature.com/ep/articles/ep02177194.html |archivedate=June 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since facial characteristics are known to be inherited, the "self seeking like" mechanism may enhance reproduction between genetically similar mates, favoring the stabilization of genes supporting social behavior, with no kin relationship among them.

== Narcissistic supply ==
{{Main|Narcissistic supply}}
Narcissistic supply is a concept introduced into [[Psychoanalysis#Theories|psychoanalytic theory]] by [[Otto Fenichel]] in 1938, to describe a type of [[admiration]], [[Social support|interpersonal support]] or sustenance drawn by an individual from his or her environment and essential to their [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=fenichel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fenichel|first = Otto|date = 1938|title = The Drive to Amass Wealth|url = http://freudians.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Fenichel-The-Drive-to-Amass-Wealth.pdf|journal = They Psychoanalytic Quarterly|volume = 7 |issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/21674086.1938.11925342|pages= 69-95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is typically used in a negative sense, describing a pathological or excessive need for attention or admiration in [[codependents]] and the orally fixated, that does not take into account the feelings, opinions or preferences of other people.

== Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury ==
{{Main|Narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury}}
Narcissistic rage is a reaction to narcissistic injury, which is a perceived threat to a narcissist's [[self-esteem]] or self-worth. ''Narcissistic injury'' and ''narcissistic scar'' are terms used by [[Sigmund Freud]] in the 1920s. ''Narcissistic wound'' and ''narcissistic blow'' are other, almost interchangeable, terms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Salman Akhtar]], ''Comprehensive Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'' (London 2009) p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''narcissistic rage'' was coined by [[Heinz Kohut]] in 1972. Narcissistic rage occurs on a continuum from aloofness, to expressions of mild irritation or annoyance, to serious outbursts, including violent attacks.&lt;ref name="isbn1-58562-204-4"/&gt;

Narcissistic rage reactions are not limited to [[personality disorders]]. They may also be seen in [[catatonic]], [[paranoid delusion]], and depressive episodes.&lt;ref name="isbn1-58562-204-4"&gt;{{cite book |author= Carl P. Malmquist|title=Homicide: A Psychiatric Perspective |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc |location= |year=2006 |pages=181–82  |isbn=1-58562-204-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that narcissists have two layers of rage. The first layer of rage can be thought of as a constant anger towards someone else, with the second layer being a self-aimed anger.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Vaknin|Vaknin, Sam]], ''Malignant Self Love: Narcissism Revisited'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narcissistic defences ==
{{Main|Narcissistic defences}}
Narcissistic defences are those processes whereby the idealized aspects of the self are preserved, and its limitations denied.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw J.A. (1999.) ''Sexual Aggression'', American Psychiatric Publishing, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be rigid and totalistic.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Alper, ''Self Defence in a Narcissistic World'' (2003) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; They are often driven by feelings of [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], conscious or unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narcissistic abuse ==
{{Main|Narcissistic abuse}}
Narcissistic abuse was originally just defined as a specific form of [[emotional abuse]] of children by [[narcissistic parents]] – parents who require the child to give up their own wants and feelings in order to serve the parent's needs for esteem.&lt;ref&gt;James I. Kepner, ''Body Process'' (1997) p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;
The term emerged in the late twentieth century due to the works of [[Alice Miller (psychologist)|Alice Miller]] and other [[Neo-Freudian]]s, rejecting psychoanalysis as being similar to the [[Poisonous pedagogy|poisonous pedagogies]].&lt;ref name="rutschky note"&gt;Note: In ''For Your Own Good'', Alice Miller herself credits [[Katharina Rutschky]] and her 1977 work ''Schwarze Pädagogik'' as the inspiration to consider the concept of ''poisonous pedagogy'',[http://www.nospank.net/fyog5.htm] which is considered as a translation of Rutschky's original term ''Schwarze Pädagogik'' (literally "black pedagogy").

[[Self-help]] culture assumes that someone abused by narcissistic parenting as a child likely struggles with [[codependency]] issues in adulthood. An adult who is or has been in a relationship with a narcissist likely struggles with not knowing what constitutes a "normal" relationship.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bailey-Rug, ''It's Not You, It's Them'' (2016) pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the term has been applied more broadly to refer to any abuse by a narcissist including in adult to adult relationships.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bailey-Rug, ''Life After Narcissistic Abuse'' (2015) pp. i–iii&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

=== Masterson's subtypes (exhibitionist and closet) ===

In 1993, [[James F. Masterson]] proposed two categories for pathological narcissism, ''[[exhibitionist]]'' and ''closet''.&lt;ref name="masterson"&gt;Masterson, James F.  The Emerging Self: A Developmental Self &amp; Object Relations Approach to the Treatment of the Closet Narcissistic Disorder of the Self, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects in the quality of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in [[DSM-IV]] and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist is more likely to be described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and greater awareness of emptiness within. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would assume that this condition was normal and that others were just like him. The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to the [[Borderline Personality Disorder|borderline]] in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Millon's variations ===

In 1996 [[Theodore Millon]] identified five variations of narcissist.&lt;ref name="millon1" /&gt; Any individual narcissist may exhibit none or one of the following:
* unprincipled narcissist: including [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] features. A [[charlatan]]—is a fraudulent, [[wikt:exploit|exploitative]], deceptive and unscrupulous individual.
* amorous narcissist: including [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] features. The [[Don Juan]] or [[Giacomo Casanova|Casanova]] of our times—is erotic, [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionist]].
*[[Compensation (psychology)|compensatory]] narcissist: including negativistic ([[Passive-aggressive behavior|passive-aggressive]]), [[Avoidant personality disorder|avoidant]] features.
* [[Elitism|elitist]] narcissist: variant of pure pattern. Corresponds to [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s "phallic narcissistic" personality type.

=== Other forms ===

==== Acquired situational narcissism ====

Acquired situational narcissism (ASN) is a form of narcissism that develops in late adolescence or adulthood, brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of [[celebrity]]. It was coined by [[Robert Millman|Robert B. Millman]], professor of [[psychiatry]] at the [[Weill Cornell Medical College]] of [[Cornell University]]. ASN differs from conventional narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society.  Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important than other people, triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to become a full-blown personality disorder. "Millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people."&lt;ref&gt;Simon Crompton, ''All about me'' (London 2007) p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; In its presentation and symptoms, it is indistinguishable from [[narcissistic personality disorder]], differing only in its late onset and its support by large numbers of others. "The lack of social norms, controls, and of people telling them how life really is, also makes these people believe they're invulnerable,"&lt;ref&gt;Crompton, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is [[Norma Desmond]], the main character of ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.

==== Codependency ====

{{Main|Codependency}}
Codependency is a tendency to behave in overly passive or excessively caretaking ways that negatively impact one's relationships and quality of life. Narcissists are considered to be natural magnets for the codependent. Rappoport identifies codependents of narcissists as "co-narcissists".&lt;ref name="co"&gt;Rappoport, Alan, Ph. D.[http://www.alanrappoport.com/pdf/Co-Narcissism%20Article.pdf Co-Narcissism: How We Adapt to Narcissistic Parents. The Therapist, 2005].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collective or group narcissism ====

{{main|Collective narcissism}}
Collective narcissism (or group narcissism) is a type of narcissism where an individual has an inflated [[self-love]] of his or her own [[ingroup]], where an "ingroup" is a group in which an individual is personally involved.&lt;ref name="Zavala"&gt;Golec de Zavala, A, et al. "Collective narcissism and its social consequences." Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 97.6 (2009): 1074–96. Psyc articles. [[EBSCO Publishing|EBSCO]]. Web. 26 Mar. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; While the classic definition of narcissism focuses on the individual, collective narcissism asserts that one can have a similar excessively high opinion of a group, and that a group can function as a narcissistic entity.&lt;ref name="Zavala" /&gt; Collective narcissism is related to [[ethnocentrism]]; however, ethnocentrism primarily focuses on self-centeredness at an ethnic or cultural level, while collective narcissism is extended to any type of ingroup beyond just cultures and ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Zavala" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bizumic"&gt;Bizumic, Boris, and John Duckitt. "My Group Is Not Worthy of Me": Narcissism and Ethnocentrism." Political Psychology 29.3 (2008): 437–53. Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. EBSCO. Web. 9 Apr. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conversational narcissism ====
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
Conversational narcissism is a term used by sociologist [[Charles Derber]] in his book, ''The Pursuit of Attention: Power and Ego in Everyday Life''.
Derber observed that the social support system in America is relatively weak, and this leads people to compete mightily for attention. In social situations, they tend to steer the [[conversation]] away from others and toward themselves. "Conversational narcissism is the key manifestation of the dominant attention-getting psychology in America," he wrote. "It occurs in informal conversations among friends, family and coworkers. The profusion of popular literature about listening and the etiquette of managing those who talk constantly about themselves suggests its pervasiveness in everyday life." What Derber describes as "conversational narcissism" often occurs subtly rather than overtly because it is prudent to avoid being judged an egotist.
Derber distinguishes the "shift-response" from the "support-response," as in the following two hypothetical conversation fragments:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
:John: I'm feeling really starved. 
:Mary: Oh, I just ate. (shift-response)

:John: I'm feeling really starved.
:Mary: When was the last time you ate? (support-response)}}

==== Cultural narcissism ====

In ''[[The Culture of Narcissism]]'', [[Christopher Lasch]] defines a narcissistic culture as one where every activity and relationship is defined by the [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] need to acquire the symbols of wealth,&lt;ref&gt;Lasch, C, The Culture of Narcissism. 1979&lt;/ref&gt; this becoming the only expression of rigid, yet covert, social [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]]. It is a culture where [[liberalism]] only exists insofar as it serves a consumer society, and even [[art]], [[sex]] and [[religion]] lose their liberating power. In such a society of constant competition, there can be no allies, and little transparency. The threats to acquisitions of social symbols are so numerous, varied and frequently incomprehensible, that defensiveness, as well as competitiveness, becomes a way of life. Any real sense of community is undermined—or even destroyed—to be replaced by virtual equivalents that strive, unsuccessfully, to synthesize a sense of community.

==== Destructive narcissism ====

Destructive narcissism is the constant exhibition of numerous and intense characteristics usually associated with the [[pathological]] narcissist but having fewer characteristics than pathological narcissism.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nina W., The Destructive Narcissistic Pattern, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malignant narcissism ====

{{Main|Malignant narcissism}}
Malignant narcissism, a term first coined in a book by [[Erich Fromm]] in 1964,&lt;ref name="fromm2"&gt;Fromm, Erich, The Heart of Man, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[syndrome]] consisting of a cross breed of the [[narcissistic personality disorder]], the [[antisocial personality disorder]], as well as [[paranoia|paranoid]] traits.  The malignant narcissist differs from one suffering from narcissistic personality disorder in that the malignant narcissist derives higher levels of psychological [[gratification]] from accomplishments over time (thus worsening the disorder).  Because the malignant narcissist becomes more involved in this psychological gratification, in the context of the right conditions, the narcissist is apt to develop the [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]], the [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], and the [[schizoid]] personality disorders. The term [[malignant]] is added to the term ''narcissist'' to indicate that individuals with this disorder have a severe form of narcissistic disorder that is characterized also by features of paranoia, psychopathy (anti-social behaviors), aggression, and sadism according to Kernberg and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Lenzenweger M.F., Clarkin J.F., Caligor E., Cain N.M., &amp; Kernberg O.F. (2018). "Malignant Narcissism in Relation to Clinical Change in Borderline Personality Disorder: An Exploratory Study". Psychopathology. [https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/492228 doi:10.1159/000492228].&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Medical narcissism ====

Medical narcissism is a term coined by John Banja in his book, ''Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism''.&lt;ref name="banja1"&gt;Banja, John, Medical Errors and Medical Narcissism, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="banja2"&gt;Banja, John, (as observed by Eric Rangus) [http://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2005/February/February7/sandr1.htm John Banja: Interview with the clinical ethicist]&lt;/ref&gt; Banja defines "medical narcissism" as the need of health professionals to preserve their [[self-esteem]] leading to the compromise of error disclosure to patients. In the book he explores the psychological, ethical and legal effects of [[medical error]]s and the extent to which a need to constantly assert their competence can cause otherwise capable, and even exceptional, professionals to fall into narcissistic traps. He claims that:
{{blockquote|...most health professionals (in fact, most professionals of any ilk) work on cultivating a self that exudes authority, control, knowledge, competence and respectability. It's the narcissist in us all—we dread appearing stupid or incompetent.}}

==== In the workplace ====
{{Main|Narcissism in the workplace}}
Narcissism as a personality trait, generally assessed with the [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]], is related to some types of behavior in the workplace. For example, individuals high in narcissism inventories are more likely to engage in [[counterproductive work behavior]] (CWB, behavior that harms organizations or other people in the workplace).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Judge | first1 = T. A. | last2 = LePine | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Rich | first3 = B. L. | year = 2006 | title = Loving Yourself Abundantly: Relationship of the Narcissistic Personality to Self- and Other Perceptions of Workplace Deviance, Leadership, and Task and Contextual Performance | url = | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 91 | issue = 4| pages = 762–76 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.91.4.762 | pmid=16834504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although individuals high in narcissism inventories might engage in more aggressive (and counterproductive) behaviors, they mainly do so when their self-esteem is threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bushman | first1 = B. J. | last2 = Baumeister | first2 = R. F. | year = 1998 | title = Threatened egotism, narcissism, self-esteem, and direct and displaced aggression: Does self-love or self-hate lead to violence? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 75 | issue = 1| pages = 219–29 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.75.1.219 | pmid=9686460}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus narcissistic employees are more likely to engage in CWB when they feel threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Penney | first1 = L.

One study found that employees who are high on narcissism are more likely to perceive the behaviors of others in the workplace as abusive and threatening than individuals who are low on narcissism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wislar | first1 = J. S. | last2 = Richman | first2 = J. A. | last3 = Fendrich | first3 = M. | last4 = Flaherty | first4 = J.

The narcissistic manager will have two main sources of [[narcissistic supply]]: inanimate – [[status symbol]]s like company cars, company-issued [[smartphone]] or prestigious offices with window views; and animate – [[flattery]] and [[attention]] from colleagues and subordinates.&lt;ref name=Dubrin&gt;{{cite book | author = A. J. DuBrin | title = Narcissism in the Workplace | date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}} Teammates may find everyday offers of support swiftly turn them into enabling sources of permanent supply, unless they are very careful to maintain proper boundaries.&lt;ref name=Dubrin/&gt;{{rp|143, 181}} The need to protect such supply networks will prevent the narcissistic managers from taking objective decisions;&lt;ref&gt;S. Allcorn, ''Organizational Dynamics and Intervention'' (2005) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; while long-term strategies will be evaluated according to their potential for attention-gaining for the manager themself.&lt;ref name=Dubrin/&gt;{{rp|122}} Organizational psychologist Alan Downs wrote a book in 1997 describing corporate narcissism.&lt;ref name="downs"&gt;Downs, Alan: Beyond The Looking Glass: Overcoming the Seductive Culture of Corporate Narcissism, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; He explores high-profile corporate leaders (such as [[Al Dunlap]] and [[Robert Eugene Allen|Robert Allen]]) who, he suggests, literally have only one thing on their minds: [[profit (economics)|profits]]. According to Downs, such narrow focus actually may yield positive short-term benefits, but ultimately it drags down individual employees as well as entire companies. Alternative thinking is proposed, and some firms now utilizing these options are examined. Downs' theories are relevant to those suggested by Victor Hill in his book, ''Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia''.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Victor (2005) Corporate Narcissism in Accounting Firms Australia, Pengus Books Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Primordial narcissism ====

Psychiatrist [[Ernst Simmel]] first defined primordial narcissism in 1944.&lt;ref name="simmel"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simmel, Ernst |author-link=Ernst Simmel |journal=[[Psychoanalytic Quarterly]] |volume=XIII |issue=2 | title=Self-Preservation and the Death Instinct |pages=160–85 |year=1944 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simmel's fundamental thesis is that the most primitive stage of libidinal development is not the oral, but the gastrointestinal one. Mouth and anus are merely to be considered as the terminal parts of this organic zone. Simmel terms the psychological condition of prenatal existence "primordial narcissism." It is the vegetative stage of the pre-ego, identical with the id. At this stage there is complete instinctual repose, manifested in unconsciousness. Satiation of the gastrointestinal zone, the representative of the instinct of self-preservation, can bring back this complete instinctual repose, which, under pathological conditions, can become the aim of the instinct. Contrary to [[Christopher Lasch|Lasch]], [[Bernard Stiegler]] argues in his book, ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]'', that [[consumer capitalism]] is in fact destructive of what he calls primordial narcissism, without which it is not possible to extend love to others.&lt;ref name="stiegler"&gt;[[Bernard Stiegler]], ''[[Acting Out (book)|Acting Out]]'' (Stanford: [[Stanford University Press]], 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, he is referring to the natural state of an infant as a [[human fetus|fetus]] and in the first few days of its life, before it has learned that other people exist besides itself, and therefore cannot possibly be aware that they are human beings with feelings, rather than having anything to do with actual narcissism.

==== {{anchor|Gender narcissism}}Sexual narcissism ====

Sexual narcissism has been described as an [[egocentric]] pattern of sexual behavior that involves an inflated sense of sexual ability and sexual entitlement.  In addition, sexual narcissism is the erotic preoccupation with oneself as a superb lover through a desire to merge sexually with a mirror image of oneself.  Sexual narcissism is an intimacy dysfunction in which sexual exploits are pursued, generally in the form of extramarital affairs, to overcompensate for low self-esteem and an inability to experience true intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurlbert, D.F.|author2=Apt, C. |title=Sexual narcissism and the abusive male |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=279–92 |year=1991 |pmid=1815094 |doi=10.1080/00926239108404352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavioral pattern is believed to be more common in men than in women and has been tied to [[domestic violence]] in men and sexual coercion in couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hurlbert, D.F.|author2=Apt, C.|author3= Gasar, S.|author4= Wilson, N.E.|author5=Murphy, Y. |title=Sexual narcissism: a validation study |journal=Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy |volume=20 |pages=24–34 |year=1994 |doi=10.1080/00926239408403414 |pmid=8169963|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11199-008-9403-9 |author=Ryan, K.M.|author2=Weikel, K.|author3=Sprechini, G. |title=Gender differences in narcissism and courtship violence in dating couples |journal=Sex Roles |volume=58 |pages=802–13 |year=2008 |issue=11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurlbert argues that sex is a natural biological given and therefore cannot be deemed as an addiction.  He and his colleagues assert that any [[sexual addiction]] is nothing more than a misnomer for what is actually sexual narcissism or sexual compulsivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1066480795032003 |author=Apt, C.|author2=Hurlbert, D.F. |title=Sexual Narcissism: Addiction or Anachronism? |journal=The Family Journal |volume=3 |pages=103–07 |year=1995 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Hurlbert writes mainly of sexual narcissism in men, Schoenewolf (2013) describes what he calls "gender narcissism" which occurs in both males and females who compensate for feelings of sexual inadequacy by becoming overly proud and obsessed with their masculinity or femininity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schoenewolf, G. |title=Psychoanalytic Centrism: Collected Papers of a Neoclassical Psychoanalyst |publisher=Living Center Press |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narcissistic parents ===

{{Main|Narcissistic parents}}
Narcissistic parents demand certain behavior from their children because they see the children as extensions of themselves, and need the children to represent them in the world in ways that meet the parents' emotional needs. This parenting 'style' most often results in estranged relationships with the children, coupled with feelings of resentment and self-destructive tendencies.&lt;ref name="co"/&gt;

=== Narcissistic leadership ===

{{Main|Narcissistic leadership}}
Narcissistic leadership is a common form of [[leadership]]. The narcissism may be healthy or destructive although there is a continuum between the two. A study published in the journal ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'' suggests that when a group is without a leader, you can often count on a narcissist to take charge. Researchers found that people who score high in narcissism tend to emerge as group leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brunell | first1 = A. B. | last2 = Gentry | first2 = W.

Supporting the contention that [[American culture]] has become more narcissistic and that this is increasingly reflected in its cultural products is an analysis of US popular song lyrics between 1987 and 2007. This found a growth in the use of first-person singular pronouns, reflecting a greater focus on the self, and also of references to antisocial behavior; during the same period, there was a diminution of words reflecting a focus on others, positive emotions, and social interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeWall|first1=C.

A linguistic analysis of the largest circulation Norwegian newspaper  found that the use of self-focused and individualistic terms increased in frequency by 69 per cent between 1984 and 2005 while collectivist terms declined by 32 per cent.&lt;ref name="Twengep203" /&gt; References to narcissism and self-esteem in American popular print media have experienced vast inflation since the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Twengep203" /&gt; Between 1987 and 2007 direct mentions of self-esteem in leading US newspapers and magazines increased by 4,540 per cent while narcissism, which had been almost non-existent in the press during the 1970s, was referred to over 5,000 times between 2002 and 2007.&lt;ref name="Twengep203" /&gt;

Cross-cultural studies of differences in narcissism are rare. Instead, as there is a positive association between narcissism and [[individualism]] and a negative one between it and [[collectivism]], these traits have been used as proxies for narcissism in some studies.&lt;ref name="Twengep202"&gt;{{cite book|last=Twenge|first=Jean M.|title=The Handbook of Narcissism and Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Theoretical Approaches, Empirical Findings, and Treatments|editor1-last=Campbell|editor1-first=W.

=== Fictional narcissists ===
* [[Jay Gatsby]], the eponymous character of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s 1925 novel ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', "an archetype of self-made American men seeking to join [[Upper class|high society]]", has been described as a "pathological narcissist" for whom the "[[Ego ideal|ego-ideal]]" has become "inflated and destructive" and whose "grandiose lies, poor sense of reality, sense of entitlement, and exploitive treatment of others" conspire toward his own demise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fitzgerald.narod.ru/critics-eng/mitchell-narcissist.html|title=The Great Narcissist: A Study of Fitzgerald's Gatsby, by Giles Mitchell.|first=Giles|last=Mitchell|website=fitzgerald.narod.ru|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the film ''[[To Die For]]'', [[Nicole Kidman|Nicole Kidman's]] character wants to appear on television at all costs, even if this involves murdering her husband. A psychiatric assessment of her character noted that she "was seen as a prototypical narcissistic person by the raters: on average, she satisfied 8 of 9 criteria for narcissistic personality disorder... had she been evaluated for personality disorders, she would receive a diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hesse|first=Morten|author2=Schliewe S |author3=Thomsen RR |year=2005|title=Rating of personality disorder features in popular movie characters|journal=BMC Psychiatry|publisher=BioMed Central|location=London|volume=5|pmid=16336663|pmc=1325244|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-244X/5/45|doi=10.1186/1471-244X-5-45|page=45|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gordon Gekko]] is a [[fictional character]] in the 1987 film ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'' and its 2010 sequel ''[[Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The return of Gordon Gekko|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2010/02/wall-street-spotlight-201002|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |last=Burrough|first=Bryan|date=February 2010|accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gekko has become a symbol in popular culture for unrestrained [[greed]] and self-interest (with the signature line, "Greed, for lack of a better word, is good"), often in fields outside [[corporate finance]].
* [[Charles Foster Kane]] is a [[fictional character]] and the subject of [[Orson Welles]]' [[1941 in film|1941 film]] ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.  The character is widely believed to be based on publishing tycoon [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Welles played Kane (receiving an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nomination), with [[Buddy Swan]] playing Kane as a child. Welles also produced, co-wrote and directed the film. ''Citizen Kane'' explores the life of the titular character, who is born of humble origins. In 1871, Kane's mother puts him under the guardianship of a [[New York City]] banker named Walter Parks Thatcher, who raises him in luxury. As an adult, Kane takes control of a [[newspaper]], which he uses to advance businesses in which Kane holds stock. Kane also hires staff members away from the rival ''Chronicle'' newspaper, regarding them as collectibles. To finance the fledgling ''Inquirer'', Kane uses his personal resources; this would allow him to operate it, even at a million dollar annual loss, for decades.
* [[Charlize Theron]]'s character in ''[[Young Adult (film)|Young Adult]]'' (2011), who conspires to return to her hometown to steal back her high school sweetheart, despite him being married with a child, embodies many narcissistic traits&amp;ndash;including the emptiness she feels when she is not receiving attention or praise from her writing.

'''Neglect''' is a form of [[abuse]] where the perpetrator, who is responsible for caring for someone who is unable to care for themselves, fails to do so. It can be a result of carelessness, indifference, or unwillingness. 

Neglect may include the failure to provide sufficient supervision, nourishment, or medical care, or the failure to fulfill other needs for which the victim cannot provide themselves. The term is also applied when necessary care is withheld by those responsible for providing it from animals, plants, and even inanimate objects. Neglect can carry on in a child's life falling into many long-term side effects such as: physical injuries, low [[self-esteem]], attention disorders, violent behavior, and can even cause death.&lt;ref name="Child Welfare Information Gateway"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Abuse and Neglect|url = https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/can/|work = Long-term consequences of child Abuse and Neglect|accessdate = 30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal definition==
In [[English law]], ''neglect'' is a [[term of art]], identical to the (now deprecated) expression ''lack of care'' and different from the concept of ''[[negligence]]''. Its sole function is to qualify a verdict returned at an [[inquest (England and Wales)|inquest]] by finding that it was a factor that contributed to a death.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Mackay of Clashfern (ed.) (2006) ''Halsbury's Laws of England'', 4th ed. reissue, vol.9(2), "Coroners", '''1035. Lack of care, neglect and self-neglect'''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of neglect==
There are many different types of neglect but they all have consequences, whether it be physically or mentally. Neglect can affect the body physically by affecting a child's development and health, sometimes leading to chronic medical problems. [[Child neglect|Children experiencing neglect]] often suffer from [[malnutrition]], which causes abnormal patterns for development. Not being given the proper nutrients at certain growth periods can result in [[stunted growth]], and inadequate bone and muscle growth. Brain functioning and [[information processing]] may also be affected by neglect. This may lead to difficulty in understanding directions, poor understanding of social relationships, or the inability to complete academic tasks without assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pledge|first=Deanna|title=Neglect|url=http://www.minddisorders.com/Kau-Nu/Neglect.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neglected children or adults can have physical injuries like [[fractures]] or severe burns that go untreated, or [[infections]], [[lice]] and other signs of lack of care. There are many physical effects neglect can have on a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Depanfillis|first=Diane|title=Child Neglect: A Guide for Prevention, Assessment and Intervention.|url=http://www.childwelfare.gov/pubs/usermanuals/neglect/chapterthree.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is neglect associated with physical problems; it also has an effect on a person mentally, ranging from poor peer relationships to violent behavior. Not only is behavior affected, but the way a person looks at themselves, which can lead to low self-esteem and the feeling of being unwanted. Neglect is more severe in younger children when it comes to psychological consequences. Parental detachment can harm the child's development of bonding and attachment to the parents, causing the child's expectations to be the same when they get older (furthering the [[cycle of violence|cycle of abuse]]). Too little parental availability can result in difficulties in [[problem solving]], [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stressful situations and [[social relationships]]. Studies of neglected children show heightened levels of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[hopelessness]], and higher incidents of [[suicide attempts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Council|first=Panel on Research on Child Abuse and Neglect, Commission on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education, National Research|title=Understanding child abuse and neglect|year=1993|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-585-02166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK98799/ |title=Analysis of Elder Abuse and Neglect Definitions Under State Law|year=2003 |website= |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |access-date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seaside, Florida.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Seaside, Florida]]]]
'''New Urbanism''' is an [[urban design]] movement which promotes environmentally friendly habits by creating [[Walkability|walkable]] neighborhoods containing a wide range of housing and job types.&lt;ref name="berkeley"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/49f234rd|author=Boeing|title=LEED-ND and Livability Revisited|journal=Berkeley Planning Journal|date=2014|volume=27|pages=31–55|accessdate=2015-04-15|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arose in the United States in the early 1980s, and has gradually influenced many aspects of [[real estate development]], [[urban planning]], and municipal [[land-use]] strategies.

New Urbanism is strongly influenced by urban design practices that were prominent until the rise of the automobile prior to [[World War II]]; it encompasses ten basic principles such as traditional neighborhood design (TND) and [[transit-oriented development]] (TOD).&lt;ref&gt;Kelbaugh, Douglas S. 2002. Repairing the American Metropolis: Common Place Revisited. Seattle: University of Washington Press. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas can all be circled back to two concepts: building a sense of community and the development of ecological practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Urbanism Principles|url = http://www.newurbanism.org/newurbanism/principles.html|website = www.newurbanism.org|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Celebration fl.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Market Street, [[Celebration, Florida]]]]

The organizing body for New Urbanism is the [https://www.cnu.org/ Congress for the New Urbanism], founded in 1993. Its foundational text is the ''Charter of the New Urbanism'', which begins:

{{quote|We advocate the restructuring of public policy and development practices to support the following principles: neighborhoods should be diverse in use and population; communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car; cities and towns should be shaped by physically defined and universally accessible public spaces and community institutions; urban places should be framed by architecture and landscape design that celebrate local history, climate, [[ecology]], and building practice.&lt;ref name="The Charter of the New Urbanism"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/charter|title=The Charter of the New Urbanism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

New Urbanists support: [[regional planning]] for open space; context-appropriate [[architecture]] and planning; adequate provision of infrastructure such as sporting facilities, libraries and community centres;&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=Planning, Funding and Delivering Social Infrastructure in Australia's Outer Suburban Growth Areas|journal=Urban Policy and Research|date=16 February 2016|doi=10.1080/08111146.2015.1099523|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/iESRIdipyg6q3MvIyPS3/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the balanced development of jobs and housing. They believe their strategies can reduce traffic congestion by encouraging the population to ride bikes, walk, or take the train. They also hope that this set up will increase the supply of affordable housing and rein in [[suburban sprawl]]. The ''[[Charter of the New Urbanism]]'' also covers issues such as [[historic preservation]], safe streets, [[green building]], and the re-development of [[brownfield land]]. The ten [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]] also phrase guidelines for new urbanist approaches.

Architecturally, new urbanist developments are often accompanied by [[New Classical Architecture|New Classical]], [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern]], or [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] styles, although that is not always the case.

==Background==

[[File:Downtown baldwin park.JPG|thumb|right|250px|New Broad Street, [[Baldwin Park, Florida]]]]

Until the mid 20th century, cities were generally organized into and developed around mixed-use walkable neighborhoods. For most of human history this meant a city that was entirely walkable, although with the development of [[public transport|mass transit]] the reach of the city extended outward along transit lines, allowing for the growth of new pedestrian communities such as [[streetcar suburb]]s. But with the advent of cheap automobiles and favorable government policies, attention began to shift away from cities and towards ways of growth more focused on the needs of the car.&lt;ref&gt;Kunstler, James Howard. 1998. ''Home from nowhere: remaking our everyday world for the twenty-first Century.'' A Touchstone book. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster. p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, after World War II [[urban planner|urban planning]] largely centered around the use of municipal [[zoning]] ordinances to segregate residential from commercial and industrial development, and focused on the construction of low-density single-family detached houses as the preferred housing format for the growing [[Middle class in the United States|middle class]]. The physical separation of where people live from where they work, shop and frequently spend their recreational time, together with low housing density, which often drastically reduced population density relative to historical norms, made automobiles indispensable for practical transportation and contributed to the emergence of a culture of [[automobile dependency]].

[[File:St petersburg florida downtown.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Beach Drive, [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]]]

This new system of development, with its rigorous separation of uses, arose after [[World War II]] and became known as "conventional suburban development"&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon and Shayne Vipond: "Gross Density and New Urbanism: Comparing Conventional and New Urbanist Suburbs in Markham, Ontario".  Journal of the American Planning Association, 1939-0130, Volume 71, Issue 1, 2005, pages 41–54&lt;/ref&gt; or pejoratively as [[urban sprawl]]. The majority of U.S. citizens now live in [[suburb]]an communities built in the last fifty years, and automobile use per capita has soared.

[[File:Post office in celebration.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Celebration, FL]] Post Office, designed by architect [[Michael Graves]]]]

Although New Urbanism as an organized movement would only arise later, a number of activists and thinkers soon began to criticize the [[modernist]] planning techniques being put into practice. Social philosopher and historian [[Lewis Mumford]] criticized the "anti-urban" development of post-war America. ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]],'' written by [[Jane Jacobs]] in the early 1960s, called for planners to reconsider the single-use housing projects, large car-dependent thoroughfares, and segregated commercial centers that had become the "norm". The French architect [[François Spoerry]] has developed in the 60's the concept of "soft architecture" that he applied to [[Port Grimaud]], a new marina in south of France. The success of this project had a considerable influence and led to many new projects of soft architecture like [[Port Liberté]] in [[New Jersey]] or Le Plessis Robisson in France.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Rooted in these early dissenters, the ideas behind New Urbanism began to solidify in the 1970s and 80s with the urban visions and theoretical models for the reconstruction of the "European" city proposed by architect [[Leon Krier]], and the [[pattern language]] theories of [[Christopher Alexander]]. The term "new urbanism" itself started being used in this context in the mid-1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Barton |date=1985 |title=The New Urbanism as a Way of Life: The Relationship Between Inner City Revitalization in Canada and the Rise of the New Middle Class |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5NyySgAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22new+urbanism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1MYLVLCvMpecygTnioCQDw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA |accessdate=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Meinig |first=Donald |date=1986 |title=The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k98OEM26HSAC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq=%22new+urbanism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UMwLVPfZOZCcygTQm4CAAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22new%20urbanism%22&amp;f=false |publisher=Yale University Press |page=255 |isbn=978-0-300-17394-9 |accessdate=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it wasn't until the early 1990s that it was commonly written as a proper noun capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1991 |title=Urban Design Update: Newsletter of the Institute for Urban Design, Volumes 7–15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8dUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22created+under+the+rubric+of+New+Urbanism%22&amp;dq=%22created+under+the+rubric+of+New+Urbanism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mc4LVOKkC5KNyATUt4DQCg&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA |publisher=Institute for Urban Design |accessdate=2014-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the [[Local Government Commission (Sacramento, California)|Local Government Commission]], a private nonprofit group in [[Sacramento, California]], invited architects [[Peter Calthorpe]], Michael Corbett, [[Andrés Duany]], Elizabeth Moule, [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]], [[Stefanos Polyzoides]], and Daniel Solomon to develop a set of community principles for land use planning. Named the ''[[Ahwahnee Principles]]'' (after [[Yosemite National Park]]'s [[Ahwahnee Hotel]]), the commission presented the principles to about one hundred government officials in the fall of 1991, at its first Yosemite Conference for Local Elected Officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgc.org/about/ahwahnee/principles|title=Principles – Local Government Commission|work=Local Government Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calthorpe, Duany, Moule, Plater-Zyberk, Polyzoides, and Solomon founded the Chicago-based Congress for the New Urbanism in 1993. The CNU has grown to more than three thousand members, and is the leading international organization promoting New Urbanist design principles. It holds annual Congresses in various U.S. cities.

In 2009, co-founders Elizabeth Moule, Hank Dittmar, and Stefanos Polyzoides authored the Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism to clarify and detail the relationship between New Urbanism and sustainability. The Canons are "a set of operating principles for human settlement that reestablish the relationship between the art of building, the making of community, and the conservation of our natural world". They promote the use of passive heating and cooling solutions, the use of locally obtained materials, and in general, a "culture of permanence". &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/sites/files/Canons.pdf  The Canons of Sustainable Architecture and Urbanism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625234557/http://www.cnu.org/sites/files/Canons.pdf |date=2014-06-25 }} |date=October 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

New Urbanism is a broad movement that spans a number of different disciplines and geographic scales. And while the conventional approach to growth remains dominant, New Urbanist principles have become increasingly influential in the fields of planning, architecture, and public policy.&lt;ref&gt;Cozens, Paul Michael. 2008. New Urbanism, Crime and the Suburbs: A Review of the Evidence. Urban Policy and Research. 26(4):429–444.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[Andrés Duany]] and [[Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk]], two of the founders of the Congress for the New Urbanism, observed mixed-use streetscapes with corner shops, front porches, and a diversity of well-crafted housing while living in one of the [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] neighborhoods of [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. They and their colleagues observed patterns including the following:

[[File:Celebration fl park.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A park in [[Celebration, Florida]]]]
[[File:Great King St., New Town.jpg|thumb|Great King St, New Town, Edinburgh]]

* The neighborhood has a discernible center. This is often a square or a green and sometimes a busy or memorable street corner. A transit stop would be located at this center.
* Most of the dwellings are within a five-minute walk of the center, an average of roughly {{convert|0.25|mi|km}}.
* There are a variety of dwelling types — usually houses, [[terraced house|rowhouse]]s, and [[apartment building|apartment]]s — so that younger and older people, [[Single (relationship)|single]]s and families, the poor and the wealthy may find places to live.
* At the edge of the neighborhood, there are shops and offices of sufficiently varied types to supply the weekly needs of a household.
* A small ancillary building or [[garage apartment]] is permitted within the backyard of each house. It may be used as a rental unit or place to work (for example, an office or craft workshop).
* An elementary school is close enough so that most children can walk from their home.
* There are small playgrounds accessible to every dwelling — not more than a tenth of a mile away.
* Streets within the neighborhood form a connected network, which disperses traffic by providing a variety of pedestrian and vehicular routes to any destination.
* The streets are relatively narrow and shaded by rows of trees. This slows traffic, creating an environment suitable for pedestrians and bicycles.
* Buildings in the neighborhood center are placed close to the street, creating a well-defined outdoor room.
* Parking lots and garage doors rarely front the street. Parking is relegated to the rear of buildings, usually accessed by alleys.
* Certain prominent sites at the termination of street vistas or in the neighborhood center are reserved for civic buildings. These provide sites for community meetings, education, and religious or cultural activities.

==Terminology==

[[File:House in celebration.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A [[Mediterranean Revival]] house in [[Celebration, Florida]]]]

Several terms are viewed either as synonymous, included in, or overlapping with the New Urbanism. The terms Neotraditional Development&lt;ref&gt;http://facweb.arch.ohio-state.edu/jnasar/crpinfo/research/NeoTradJPER2003.pdf{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Traditional Neighborhood Development are often associated with the New Urbanism. These terms generally refer to complete New Towns or new neighborhoods, often built in traditional architectural styles, as opposed to smaller infill and redevelopment projects. The term Traditional Urbanism has also been used to describe the New Urbanism by those who object to the "new" moniker. The term "Walkable Urbanism" was proposed as an alternative term by developer and professor Christopher Leinberger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leinberger|first1=Christopher|title=The Option of Urbanism|date=2009|publisher=Island Press|location=District of Columbia|isbn=1-59726-137-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many debate whether [[Smart Growth]] and the New Urbanism are the same or whether substantive differences exist between the two; overlap exists in membership and content between the two movements. Placemaking is another term that is often used to signify New Urbanist efforts or those of like-minded groups. The term Transit-Oriented Development is sometimes cited as being coined by prominent New Urbanist [[Peter Calthorpe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archdaily.com/409612/does-china-s-urbanization-spell-doom-or-salvation-peter-calthorpe-weighs-in/|title=Does China's Urbanization Spell Doom or Salvation? Peter Calthorpe Weighs In&amp;nbsp;... |work=ArchDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is heavily promoted by New Urbanists. The term [[Sustainable development]] is sometimes associated with the New Urbanism as there has been an increasing focus on the environmental benefits of New Urbanism associated with the rise of the term sustainability in the 2000s, however, this has caused some confusion as the term is also used by the [[United Nations]] and [[Agenda 21]] to include [[Human development (humanity)|human development]] issues (e.g., [[developing country]]) that exceed the scope of [[land development]] intended to be addressed by the New Urbanism or [[Sustainable Urbanism]]. The term "livability" or "livable communities" was popular under the [[Obama administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.streetsblog.org/2011/05/04/president-obamas-transportation-bill-prioritizes-livability-high-speed-rail/|title=President Obama's Transportation Bill Prioritizes Livability, High-Speed Rail – Streetsblog USA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it dates back at least to the mid-1990s when the term was used by the [[Local Government Commission (Sacramento, California)|Local Government Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newpartners.org/about/about-the-event|title=About the Event|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023010313/http://www.newpartners.org/about/about-the-event|archivedate=2014-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:House in baldwin park.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A [[Key West]] style house in [[Baldwin Park, Florida]]]]

Planning magazine discussed the proliferation of "urbanisms" in an article in 2011 titled "A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Jonathan|title=A Short Guide to 60 of the Newest Urbanisms|date=April 2014|volume=77|issue=4|pages=19–21|url=https://www.planning.org/planning/2011/apr/60urbanisms.htm|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several New Urbanists have popularized terminology under the umbrella of the New Urbanism including [[Sustainable Urbanism]] and Tactical Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/design/2012/03/guide-tactical-urbanism/1387/|title=The Official Guide to Tactical Urbanism|work=CityLab}}&lt;/ref&gt; (of which Guerrilla Urbanism can be viewed as a subset). The term Tactical Urbanism was coined by Frenchman Michel de Certau in 1968 and revived in 2011 by New Urbanist Mike Lydon and the co-authors of the Tactical Urbanism Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tactical-urbanism-citizen-projects-go-mainstream/|title=Tactical urbanism: Citizen projects go mainstream|date=1 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 [[Andres Duany]] authored a book that used the term Agrarian Urbanism to describe an agriculturally-focused subset of New Urbanist town design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Duany, Andres]] | title=Garden Cities: Theory &amp; Practice of Agrarian Urbanism | publisher=The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment | year=2011| isbn=1-906384-04-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013 a group of New Urbanists led by CNU co-founder [[Andres Duany]] began a research project under the banner of Lean Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/design/2014/03/why-andres-duany-so-focused-making-lean-urbanism-thing/8635/|title=Why Andrés Duany Is So Focused on Making 'Lean Urbanism' a Thing|work=CityLab}}&lt;/ref&gt; which purported to provide a bridge between Tactical Urbanism and the New Urbanism.

Other terms have surfaced in reaction to the New Urbanism intended to provide a contrast, alternative to, or a refinement of the New Urbanism. Some of these terms include Everyday Urbanism by Harvard Professor Margaret Crawford, John Chase, and John Kaliski,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Chase, John | title=Everyday Urbanism| publisher=The Monacelli Press | year=1999| isbn=1-885254-81-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecological Urbanism]], and True Urbanism by architect Bernard Zyscovich. [[Landscape urbanism]] was popularized by Charles Waldheim who explicitly defined it as in opposition to the New Urbanism in his lectures at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mehaffy|first1=Michael|title=The Landscape Urbanism: Sprawl in a Pretty Green Dress?|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/46262|website=Planetizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents'', edited by Andres Duany and Emily Talen, specifically addressed the tension between these two views of [[urbanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsociety.com/Books/L/Landscape-Urbanism-and-its-Discontents|title=Landscape Urbanism and its Discontents|work=New Society Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael E. Arth]] promotes what he describes as a variant of the New Urbanism called the [[New pedestrianism|New Pedestrianism]], which is intended to be more pedestrian-oriented and traces its origins to a 1929 [[planned community]] in [[Radburn, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="ArthMichael"&gt;Arth, Michael E. (2010). ''Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests'' Golden Apples Media, {{ISBN|978-0-912467-12-2}}. pp. 120–139, 363–386&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
[[File:Sankt Eriksområdet 2014, 1.JPG|thumb|250px|New urbanist ''Sankt Eriksområdet'' quarter in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], built in the 1990s. ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:S:t_Eriksomr%C3%A5det More photos])]]
[[File:Bitola 2007.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Mixed use pedestrian-friendly street in [[Bitola]], [[Republic of Macedonia]].]]
The primary organization promoting the New Urbanism in the United States is the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] (CNU). The Congress for the New Urbanism is the leading organization promoting walkable, mixed-use neighborhood development, sustainable communities and healthier living conditions.  CNU members promote the principles of CNU's Charter and the hallmarks of New Urbanism, including:

* Livable streets arranged in compact, walkable blocks.
* A range of housing choices to serve people of diverse ages and income levels.
* Schools, stores and other nearby destinations reachable by walking, bicycling or transit service.
* An affirming, human-scaled public realm where appropriately designed buildings define and enliven streets and other public spaces.

The CNU has met annually since 1993 when they held their first general meeting in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], with approximately one hundred attendees. By 2008 the Congress was drawing two to three thousand attendees to the annual meetings.

The CNU began forming local and regional chapters circa 2004 with the founding of the New England and Florida Chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cnuflorida.org/|title=Home – Congress For The New Urbanism Florida Chapter|work=Congress For The New Urbanism Florida Chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011 there were 16 official chapters and interest groups for 7 more.  {{As of|2013}}, Canada hosts two full CNU Chapters, one in Ontario (CNU Ontario), and one in British Columbia (Cascadia) which also includes a portion of the north-west US states.

While the CNU has international participation in Canada, sister organizations have been formed in other areas of the world including the Council for European Urbanism (CEU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceunet.org/|title=C.E.U. Council for European Urbanism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Movement for Israeli Urbanism (MIU) and the Australian Council for the New Urbanism.

By 2002 chapters of Students for the New Urbanism began appearing at universities including the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]], [[University of Georgia]], [[University of Notre Dame]], and the [[University of Miami]]. In 2003, a group of younger professionals and students met at the 11th Congress in Washington, D.C. and began developing a "Manifesto of the Next Generation of New Urbanists". The [[Next Generation of New Urbanists]] held their first major session the following year at the 12th meeting of the CNU in Chicago in 2004. The group has continued meeting annually {{As of|2014|lc=y}} with a focus on young professionals, students, new member issues, and ensuring the flow of fresh ideas and diverse viewpoints within the New Urbanism and the CNU. Spinoff projects of the Next Generation of the New Urbanists include the Living Urbanism publication first published in 2008 and the first [[Tactical Urbanism]] Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tacticalurbanismguide.com/|title=Tactical Urbanism Materials Guide – Your resource for getting TU Projects done in your community!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CNU has spawned publications and research groups. Publications include the ''New Urban News'' and the ''New Town Paper''. Research groups have formed independent nonprofits to research individual topics such as the Form-Based Codes Institute, The National Charrette Institute and the Center for Applied Transect Studies.

In the [[United Kingdom]] New Urbanist and European urbanism principles are practised and taught by [[The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment]]. Other organisations promote New Urbanism as part of their remit, such as [[International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture &amp; Urbanism|INTBAU]], A Vision of Europe, and others.

The CNU and other national organizations have also formed partnerships with like-minded groups. Organizations under the banner of [[Smart Growth]] also often work with the Congress for the New Urbanism. In addition the CNU has formed partnerships on specific projects such as working with the [[United States Green Building Council]] and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] to develop the [[LEED for Neighborhood Development]] standards,&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt; and with the [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]] to develop a [[Context Sensitive Solutions]] (CSS) Design manual.

==Film==

The New Urbanism Film Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newurbanismfilmfestival.com/|title=New Urbanism Film Festival|work=New Urbanism Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held in 2013 and 2014 in Los Angeles to highlight films and short films about the New Urbanism and related topics. The 2011 film ''[[Urbanized]]'' by Gary Hustwit featured then CNU Board Chair Ellen Dunham-Jones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hustwit.com/about-urbanized/|title=About Urbanized|work=Gary Hustwit|access-date=2014-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023010411/http://www.hustwit.com/about-urbanized/|archive-date=2014-10-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other urban thinkers on the international story of urbanization including the New Urbanist efforts in the United States.

The 2004 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The End of Suburbia|The End of Suburbia: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream]]'' argues that the depletion of oil will result in the demise of the sprawl-type development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endofsuburbia.com [http://www.endofsurburbia.com/ link to official website]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism]]'', a feature length 2008 documentary about urban designer [[Michael E. Arth]], explains the principles of his [[New Pedestrianism]], a more ecological and pedestrian-oriented version of New Urbanism.&lt;ref name="ArthMichael" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelearth.com/democracy/ Website about ''Democracy and the Common Wealth'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The film also gives a brief history of New Urbanism, and chronicles the rebuilding of an inner city slum into a model of New Pedestrianism and New Urbanism called The Garden District.&lt;ref&gt;Teri Pruden, "The New Urban Cowboy: Michael E. Arth transforms Cracktown into Historic Garden District in DeLand" DeLand Magazine, Jan–Feb, 2008.

==Criticism==
{{Globalize|date=February 2010}}
New Urbanism has drawn both praise and criticism from all parts of the [[political spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sharifi|first1=Ayyoob|title=From Garden City to Eco-urbanism: The quest for sustainable neighborhood development|journal=Sustainable Cities and Society|date=September 2015|doi=10.1016/j.scs.2015.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticized both for being a [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] scheme and for failing to address social equity and for both restricting private enterprise and for being a deregulatory force in support of private sector developers.

Journalist [[Alex Marshall (Journalist)|Alex Marshall]] has decried New Urbanism as essentially a marketing scheme that repackages conventional suburban sprawl behind a façade of nostalgic imagery and empty, aspirational slogans.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Alex Marshall, "Building New Urbanism: Less Filling, But Not So Tasty", ''Builder Magazine'', 30 November 1999, p. ___. Print; archived on Marshall's web site, http://www.alexmarshall.org/2006/08/02/building-new-urbanism-less-filling-but-not-so-tasty/. Retrieved 1 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 article in [[Metropolis (architecture magazine)|Metropolis Magazine]], Marshall denounced New Urbanism as "a grand fraud".&lt;ref&gt;Alex Marshall, "Suburbs in Disguise", ''Metropolis Magazine'', July 1996, p. 70, republished as "New Urbanism" in Busch, Akiko, ed., ''Design is&amp;nbsp;... Words, Things, People, Buildings and Places'' (New York:Metropolis Books/Princeton Architectural Press, 2002), p. 272; and as "Suburbs in Disguise" on Marshall's web site, http://www.alexmarshall.org/2007/08/31/suburbs-in-disguise/, retrieved 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The attack continued in numerous articles, including an opinion column in the ''Washington Post'' in September of the same year,&lt;ref&gt;Alex Marshall, "Putting Some 'City' Back In the Suburbs", ''Washington Post'', 1 September 1996, p. C1, print, https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/library/growth/solutions/nokent.htm; retrieved 2 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Marshall's first book, [http://utpress.utexas.edu/index.php/books/marhow ''How Cities Work:  Suburbs, Sprawl, and the Roads Not Taken'']&lt;ref&gt;U. of Texas Press 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have asserted that the effectiveness claimed for the New Urbanist solution of mixed income developments lacks statistical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Popkin, S. et al. (2004) A Decade of HOPE VI. The Urban Institute&lt;/ref&gt;  Independent studies have supported the idea of addressing poverty through mixed-income developments,&lt;ref&gt;Goetz, Edward G. (2003) Clearing the Way: Deconcentrating the Poor in Urban America, The Urban Institute Press: Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaskin, R.J., Joseph, M.L., Webber, H.S. (2007) The Theoretical Basis for Addressing Poverty Through Mixed-Income Development. Urban Affairs Review 42 (3): 369–409.&lt;/ref&gt; but the argument that New Urbanism produces such diversity has been challenged from findings from one community in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, J. and K. Perrott (2009) Producing diversity in a new urbanism community. Town Planning Review 80 (3): 267–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some parties have criticized the New Urbanism for being too accommodating of motor vehicles and not going far enough to promote walking, cycling, and public transport. The Charter of the New Urbanism states that "communities should be designed for the pedestrian and transit as well as the car".&lt;ref name="The Charter of the New Urbanism"/&gt; Some critics suggest that communities should exclude the car altogether in favor of [[Car-free movement|car-free developments]].  Michael E Arth proposes [[new pedestrianism]] as a way to further elevate the status of pedestrians by focusing on pedestrian-only paths. Steve Melia proposes the idea of "filtered permeability" (see [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)]]) which increases the connectivity of the pedestrian and cycling network resulting in a time and convenience advantage over drivers while still limiting the connectivity of the vehicular network and thus maintaining the safety benefits of cul de sacs and horseshoe loops in resistance to property crime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stevemelia.co.uk/ltt.htm "Neighbourhoods Should be Made Permeable for Walking and Cycling but not for Cars"], Steve Melia, Local Transport Today, January 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to critiques of a lack of evidence for the New Urbanism's claimed environmental benefits, a rating system for neighborhood environmental design, [[LEED-ND]], was developed by the [[U.S. Green Building Council]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], and the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnu.org/leednd |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014174711/http://www.cnu.org/leednd |archivedate=2014-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to quantify the sustainability of New Urbanist neighborhood design.&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/articles/getting-know-leed-neighborhood-development|title=Getting to know LEED: Neighborhood Development|date=1 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Urbanist and board member of CNU, [[Doug Farr]] has taken a step further and coined [[Sustainable Urbanism]], which combines New Urbanism and LEED-ND to create walkable, transit-served urbanism with high performance buildings and infrastructure.

New Urbanism has been criticized for being a form of centrally planned, large-scale development, "instead of allowing the initiative for construction to be taken by the final users themselves".&lt;ref&gt;[http://p2pfoundation.net/Brief_History_of_P2P-Urbanism "A brief history of Peer-to-peer Urbanism"], Nikos Salingaros and Federico Mena-Quintero, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; It has been criticized for asserting universal principles of design instead of attending to local conditions.&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grant, J. (2006) Planning the Good Community: New Urbanism in Theory and Practice. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
{{Main article|Examples of New Urbanism}}

===United States===

New Urbanism is having a growing influence on how and where metropolitan regions choose to grow. At least fourteen large-scale planning initiatives are based on the principles of linking transportation and land-use policies, and using the neighborhood as the fundamental building block of a region.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} [[Miami, Florida]], has adopted the most ambitious New Urbanist-based zoning code reform yet undertaken by a major U.S. city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnu.org/node/3166|title=Saving western Maryland before it's swallowed up|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than six hundred new towns, villages, and neighborhoods, following New Urbanist principles, have been planned or are currently under construction in the U.S. Hundreds of new, small-scale, urban and suburban infill projects are under way to reestablish walkable streets and blocks. In Maryland and several other states, New Urbanist principles are an integral part of ''[[smart growth]]'' legislation.

In the mid-1990s, the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) adopted the principles of the New Urbanism in its multibillion-dollar program to rebuild public housing projects nationwide. New Urbanists have planned and developed hundreds of projects in infill locations. Most were driven by the private sector, but many, including HUD projects, used public money.

====University Place in Memphis====

In 2010 University Place in Memphis became the second only [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) LEED certified neighborhood.  LEED ND (neighborhood development) standards integrates principles of smart growth, urbanism and green building  and were developed through a collaboration between USGBC, Congress for the New Urbanism, and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]].  University Place, developed by [[McCormack Baron Salazar]], is a 405-unit, 30-acre, mixed-income, mixed use, multigenerational, [[HOPE VI]] grant community that revitalized the severely distressed Lamar Terrace public housing site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multihousingnews.com/news/south/architecture-inc-celebrates-leed-nd-certification-of-university-place-in-memphis/1004034759.html  Architecture Inc. Celebrates LEED-ND Certification of University Place in Memphis], Multi Housing News, May 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Cotton District====
[[The Cotton District]] in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], was the first New Urbanist development, begun in 1968 long before the New Urbanism movement was organized.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tndtownpaper.com/Volume4/new_towns_cotton_district.htm] The Town Paper, Vol. 4, No. 1 — December 2001/ January 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The District borders Mississippi State University, and consists mostly of residential rental units for college students along with restaurants, bars and retail. The Cotton District got its name because it is built in the vicinity of an old cotton mill.

====Seaside====
[[Seaside, Florida]], the first fully New Urbanist town, began development in 1981 on eighty acres (324,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of [[Florida Panhandle]] coastline. It was featured on the cover of the [[Atlantic Monthly]] in 1988, when only a few streets were completed, and has become internationally famous for its architecture, and the quality of its streets and public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamer|first1=David|title=Learning from the past: Historic Districts and the New Urbanism in the United States|journal=Planning Perspectives|date=2000|volume=15|issue=2|pages=107–122|doi=10.1080/026654300364047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seaside is now a tourist destination and appeared in the 1998 movie ''[[The Truman Show]]''. Lots sold for $15,000 in the early 1980s, and slightly over a decade later, the price had escalated to about $200,000. Today, most lots sell for more than a million dollars, and some houses top $5&amp;nbsp;million.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

====Mueller Community====
The [[Mueller Community]] is located on the 700 acre site of the former [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]] in [[Austin, Texas]], which closed in 1999. Per the developer, the value of the Mueller development upon completion will be $1.3 billion, and will comprise 4.2 million square feet of non-residential development, 650,000 square feet of retail space, 4,600 homes, and 140 acres of open space. An estimated 10,000 permanent jobs within the development will have been created by the time it is complete. The Mueller Community also has more electric cars per capita than any other neighborhood in the United States – a fact partially attributable to an incentive program.

====Stapleton====
The site of the former [[Stapleton International Airport]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and [[Aurora, Colorado]], closed in 1995, is now being redeveloped by [[Forest City Enterprises]].&lt;ref name="LAT 2003-10-18"&gt;Vincent, Roger and Groves, Martha (October 18, 2003) [http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/18/business/fi-playa18 "L.A.'s Urban Model"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved 12 October 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Stapleton is expected to be home to at least 30,000 residents, six schools and 2&amp;nbsp;million square feet (180,000&amp;nbsp;m²) of retail. Construction began in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandtech.org/ DSST Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-10-26-100-million_x.htm USA Today&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northfield Stapleton]], one of the development's major retail centers, recently opened.

====San Antonio====
In 1997 [[San Antonio, Texas]], as part of a new master plan, created new regulations called the Unified Development Code (UDC), largely influenced by New Urbanism. One feature of the UDC is six unique land development patterns that can be applied to certain districts: Conservation Development, Commercial Center Development, Office or Institutional Campus Development, Commercial Retrofit Development, Tradition Neighborhood Development, [[Transit Oriented Development]]. Each district has specific standards and design regulation. The six development patterns were created to reflect existing development patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Greenburg, Ellen, 2004. Codifying New Urbanism: How to Reform Municipal Land Development Regulations. American Planning Association PAS Report Number 526&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mountain House====
[[Mountain House, San Joaquin County, California|Mountain House]], one of the latest New Urbanist projects in the United States, is a new town located near [[Tracy, California]].  Construction started in 2001. Mountain House will consist of 12 villages, each with its own elementary school, park, and commercial area. In addition, a future [[train station]], transit center and bus system are planned for Mountain House.

====Mesa del Sol====
[[Mesa del Sol]], New Mexico—the largest New Urbanist project in the United States—was designed by architect [[Peter Calthorpe]], and is being developed by [[Forest City Enterprises]]. Mesa del Sol may take five decades to reach full build-out, at which time it should have 38,000 residential units, housing a population of 100,000; a {{convert|1400|acre|km2|adj=on}} industrial office park; four town centers; an urban center; and a [[downtown]] that would provide a [[twin towns and sister cities|twin city]] within [[Albuquerque]].

====I'On====
Located in [[Mount Pleasant, South Carolina]], [[I'On]] is a traditional neighborhood development, mixed with a new urbanism  styled architecture, reflecting on the building designs of the nearby downtown areas of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. Founded on April 30, 1995, I'On was designed by the town planning firms of Dover, Kohl &amp; Partners and [[Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company]], and currently holds over 750 single family homes. Features of the community include extensive sidewalks, shared [[public]] greens and parks, [[trails]] and a grid of narrow, [[traffic calming]] streets. Most homes are required to have a [[front porch]] of not less than eight feet (2.46&amp;nbsp;m) in depth. Floor heights of 10 feet (3.1&amp;nbsp;m), raised foundations and smaller lot sizes give the community a [[Urban density|dense]], vertical feel.

====Haile Plantation====
[[Haile Plantation, Florida]], is a 2,600 household ({{convert|1,700|acre|km2}}) development of regional impact southwest of the city of Gainesville, within Alachua County. Haile Village Center is a traditional neighborhood center within the development. It was originally started in 1978 and completed in 2007. In addition to the 2,600 homes the neighborhood consists of two merchant centers (one a New England narrow street village and the other a chain grocery strip mall). There are also two public elementary schools and an 18-hole golf course.

====Celebration, Florida====
In June 1996, the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]] unveiled its 5,000&amp;nbsp;acre (20&amp;nbsp;km²) town of [[Celebration, Florida|Celebration]], near Orlando, Florida. Celebration opened its downtown in October 1996, relying heavily on the experiences of Seaside, whose downtown was nearly complete. Disney shuns the label New Urbanism, calling Celebration simply a "town".

Celebration's Downtown has become one of the area's most popular tourist destinations making the community a showcase for New Urbanism as a prime example of the creation of a "sense of place".&lt;ref&gt;Celebration Business Alliance, Sept 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jersey City====
The construction of the [[Hudson Bergen Light Rail]] in [[Hudson County, New Jersey]] has spurred transit-oriented development. In [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], two projects are planned to transform [[brownfield]] sites, both of which have required remediation of [[toxic waste]] by previous owners. [[Bayfront, Jersey City|Bayfront]], once site of a [[Honeywell]] plant is a {{convert|100|acre|km2}} site on the [[Hackensack River]], and is nearby the planned West Campus of [[New Jersey City University]]. [[Canal Crossing, Jersey City|Canal Crossing]], named for the former [[Morris Canal]], was once partially owned by [[PPG Industries]], and is a {{convert|117|acre|km2}} site west of [[Liberty State Park]].

====Old York Village, Chesterfield Township, New Jersey====
The sparsely developed agricultural [[Chesterfield Township, New Jersey|Township of Chesterfield]] in [[New Jersey]] covers approximately {{convert|21.61|sqmi|km2}} and has made farmland preservation a priority since the 1970s.  Chesterfield has permanently preserved more than {{convert|7000|acre|km2}} of farmland through state and county programs and a township-wide transfer of development credits program that directs future growth to a designated "receiving area" known as Old York Village.  Old York Village is a neo-traditional, new urbanism town on {{convert|560|acre|km2}} incorporating a variety of housing types, neighborhood commercial facilities, a new elementary school, civic uses, and active and passive open space areas with preserved agricultural land surrounding the planned village.  Construction began in the early 2000s and a significant percentage of the community is now complete. Old York Village was the winner of the American Planning Association National Outstanding Planning Award in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:bF_sLhalru4J:www.clarkecatonhintz.com/news_62/cch.pdf+Old+York+Village+Chesterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShmUa4sV_i-RkZGv6VCfru69zqmyvd5QuPhmbvt5rknjP-2U5ceIqitHl7582Z5kNIPD4OgHwbRbyf1gybr7uRoLFeZNt2zwDdwkAHE8sIn0CrPSu1O0ENRX_hc9dHjNk6SxPjS&amp;sig=AHIEtbSNUnz4J_fonSY-LCM60WBGc0GLxw "Old York Village, Chesterfield Wins an American Planning Association Award for an Outstanding Project/ Program/ Tool"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesterfieldtwp.com/Smart%20Growth/smartgrowthpage.html "Old York Village Implementing Smart Growth"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001092432/http://www.chesterfieldtwp.com/Smart%20Growth/smartgrowthpage.html |date=2011-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesterfieldtwp.com/Smart%20Growth/Master%20Plan%20Amendment-May%2028,%202002.pdf "Master Plan Amendment: Township of Chesterfield"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Civita ====
[[Civita (San Diego, California)|Civita]] is a [[Sustainable development|sustainable]], [[Transportation|transit]]-oriented 230-acre master-planned village under development in the [[Mission Valley, San Diego|Mission Valley]] area of [[San Diego, California]], [[United States]].

==== Del Mar Station ====
[[Del Mar (Los Angeles Metro station)]], which won a Congress for the New Urbanism Charter Award in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnu.org/node/916#2003 "Charter Award Recipients"], Congress for the New Urbanism (accessed 8 April 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[transit-oriented development]] surrounding a prominent Metro Rail stop on the Gold Line, which connects Los Angeles and Pasadena. Located at the southern edge of downtown Pasadena, it serves as a gateway to the city with 347 apartments, out of which 15% are affordable units. Approximately 20,000 square feet of retail is linked with a network of public plazas, paseos and private courtyards. The 3.4-acre, $77 million project sits above a 1,200-car multi-level subterranean parking garage, with 600 spaces dedicated to transit. The light rail right of way, detailed as a public street, bisects the site. It was designed by [[Moule &amp; Polyzoides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Del Mar Station Transit Village|url=http://www.mparchitects.com/site/projects/del-mar-station-transit-village|publisher=Moule &amp; Polyzoides|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnu.org/resources/projects/del-mar-station-2007 Del Mar Station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412172431/https://www.cnu.org/resources/projects/del-mar-station-2007 |date=2015-04-12 }}, Congress for the New Urbanism, September 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Norfolk VA East Beach ====
Norfolk, VA, East Beach. designed and built in the style of traditional Atlantic coastal villages. The Master Plan for East Beach was developed in the style of “New Urbanism” by world renowned TND master planners Duany Plater-Zyberk.  Newly constructed homes reflect traditional classic detail and proportion of Tidewater Virginia homes, and are built with materials that will withstand the test of time and forces of Mother Nature and the Chesapeake Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbeachnorfolk.com/index.php|title=East Beach Norfolk – Luxury Condos, Villas, Waterfront Homes – A Simple Life on the Chesapeake Bay|publisher=|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===

New Urbanism is closely related to the [[Urban village]] movement in Europe. They both occurred at similar times and share many of the same principles although urban villages has an emphasis on traditional city planning. In Europe many brown-field sites have been redeveloped since the 1980s following the models of the traditional city neighbourhoods rather than Modernist models. One well-publicized example is [[Poundbury]] in England, a suburban extension to the town of Dorchester, which was built on land owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] under the overview of [[Prince Charles]]. The original masterplan was designed by [[Leon Krier]]. A report carried out after the first phase of construction found a high degree of satisfaction by residents, although the aspirations to reduce [[car dependency]] had not been successful. Rising house prices and a perceived premium have made the open market housing unaffordable for many local people.&lt;ref name="poundbury"&gt;WATSON, G., BENTLEY, I., ROAF, S. and SMITH, P., 2004. Learning from Poundbury, Research for the West Dorset District Council and the Duchy of Cornwall. Oxford Brookes University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Council for European Urbanism (CEU), formed in 2003, shares many of the same aims as the U.S.'s New Urbanists. CEU's Charter is a development of the [[Congress for the New Urbanism]] Charter revised and reorganised to relate better to European conditions. An Australian organisation, Australian Council for New Urbanism has since 2001 run conferences and events to promote New Urbanism in that country. A [[New Zealand Urban Design Protocol]] was created by the Ministry for the Environment in 2005.

There are many developments around the world that follow New Urbanist principles to a greater or lesser extent:

====Europe====
*[[Le Plessis-Robinson]], a 21st-century example of [[New classical architecture|neo-traditionalism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetizen.com/node/57600|title=Le Plessis-Robinson: A Model for Smart Growth|work=Planetizen: The independent resource for people passionate about planning and related fields}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the south-west of Paris. This city is in the process of transforming itself, destroying old modern blocklike buildings and replacing them with traditional buildings and houses in one of the biggest worldwide projects with Val d'Europe.  In 2008 the city was nominated best architectural project of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jeunesarchi.com{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Poundbury]], in Dorset, England, is a neotraditionalist urban extension focussed on high quality urban realm and the expression of traditional modes of urban or village life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/design/behind-the-facade-of-prince-charless-poundbury_o|title=Behind the Façade of Prince Charles's Poundbury|date=2013-12-03|newspaper=Architect|access-date=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Other developments can be found at Heulebrug, part of [[Knokke-Heist]], in [[Belgium]], and Fonti di Matilde in [[:it:San Bartolomeo (Reggio Emilia)|San Bartolomeo]] (outside of [[Reggio Emilia]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://interactive.wttw.com/bontempi/selected-works|title=Bontempi Selected Works|work=WTTW Chicago Public Media – Television and Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]].
*[[Kartanonkoski]], in [[Vantaa]], [[Finland]], is the only example of neotraditional architecture in Finland implemented on a larger scale. The area has around 4000 inhabitants and its architecture has been mainly influenced by [[Nordic Classicism]].

====Americas====
*[[Mahogany Bay Village, Belize]], is a 60-acre New Urbanist community on Ambergris Caye, Belize. 
*[[Orchid Bay, Belize]], is one of the largest New Urbanist projects in Central America and the Caribbean.
*[[Las Catalinas, Costa Rica]], is a coastal town in the [[Guanacaste Province]] of Northwest [[Costa Rica]]. Envisioned as a compact, walkable beach town, Las Catalinas was founded in 2006 by [[Charles Brewer (businessman)|Charles Brewer]] and incorporates many of the principles of New Urbanism.
*[[McKenzie Towne, Calgary|McKenzie Towne]] is a New Urbanist development which commenced in 1995 by [[Carma Developers]] LP in [[Calgary]].
*[[Cornell, Ontario|Cornell]], within the city of [[Markham, Ontario]], was designed with walkable neighborhoods, density to support public transit, a variety of housing types and retail.&lt;ref&gt;

*New Amherst is a new urbanist development in the town of [[Cobourg, Ontario]].
*[[UniverCity]], beside the [[Simon Fraser University]] campus on Burnaby Mountain in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]], is an award-winning sustainable community that is designed to be walkable, dense, and well connected to public transit networks.

====Asia====
*The structure plan for [[Thimphu]], [[Bhutan]], follows [[Principles of Intelligent Urbanism]], which share underlying axioms with the New Urbanism.

====Africa====
There are several such developments in South Africa. The most notable is [[Melrose Arch]] in [[Johannesburg]]. [[Triple Point (East London)|Triple Point]] is a comparable mixed-use development in [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], in [[Eastern Cape]] province. The development, announced in 2007, comprises 30&amp;nbsp;hectares. It is made up of three apartment complexes together with over 30 residential sites as well as 20,000 sq&amp;nbsp;m of residential and office space. The development is valued at over R2&amp;nbsp;billion ($250&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eprop.co.za/news/item/9127-East-London-gets-own-Melrose-Arch.html |title="EAST LONDON GETS OWN MELROSE ARCH", ''eProp.co.za, 12 December 2007 |access-date=2013-01-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427102550/http://www.eprop.co.za/news/item/9127-East-London-gets-own-Melrose-Arch.html |archive-date=2015-04-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been cases where market forces of urban decay are confused with new urbanism in [https://www.africaurban.org/debunking-new-urbanism-harare/ African cities].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.africaurban.org/debunking-new-urbanism-harare/|title=Debunking New Urbanism in Harare|last=Muzenda|first=Archimedes|date=|website=|publisher=African Urban Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907144749/https://www.africaurban.org/debunking-new-urbanism-harare/|archive-date=2018-09-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to a form of suburban mixed-use development that does not promote walkability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infrastructurene.ws/2016/08/25/in-search-of-a-new-african-urbanism/|title=In search of a new African urbanism {{!}} Infrastructure news|website=www.infrastructurene.ws|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.up.ac.za/media/shared/Legacy/sitefiles/file/44/1068/3229/9086/africanperspectives/pdf/papers/viana.pdf|title=African City: towards a new paradigm –“chameleonic” urbanism for hybrid cities|last=Viana|first=|date=|website=|publisher=African Perspectives Conference Proceedings|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
Most new developments on the edges of Australia's major cities are master planned, often guided expressly by the principles of New Urbanism. The relationship between housing, activity centres, the transport network and key social infrastructure (sporting facilities, libraries, community centres etc.) is defined at structure planning stage.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;
*Tullimbar Village, NSW Australia, is a new development which follows the principles of New Urbanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tullimbar Village :: Wollongong NSW :: Contemporary Lifestyle Community|url = http://www.tullimbarvillage.com.au|website = www.tullimbarvillage.com.au|accessdate = 2015-05-29|first = Screen|last = Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2017}}{{primary source inline|date=December 2017}}

Another important factor or principle of New Urbanism that guides Australia's major cities is how good their foot circulation seems to be which is guided by the wayfinding systems that are implemented. Kenneth B. Hall, Jr. and Gerald A. Porterfield said in their book, "Community by Design," the way to gain good circulation is to take some thoughtful consideration to things like wayfinding, sight lines, transition, visual clues, and reference points.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community by Design|last=Hall|first=Kenneth B.|publisher=The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc|others=Gerald A. Porterfield|year=2001|location=|pages=97|doi=10.1036/007141794X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circulation design should work to create an interesting and informative system that utilizes subtle elements as well as technical ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; City of Port Philip, Australia,  is a good example of wayfinding where they have come up with a comprehensive pedestrian signage system, specifically for their local areas of St Kilda, South Melbourne and Port Melbourne.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victoriawalks.org.au/wayfinding/|title=Case study - Wayfinding signage|website=www.victoriawalks.org.au|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.studiobinocular.com/2013/02/city-of-port-phillip-wayfinding/|title=City of Port Phillip: Wayfinding - Studio Binocular|date=2013-02-09|work=Studio Binocular|access-date=2018-04-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's wayfinding system consists of 26 individually designed panels that are placed on some major streets such as St Kilda and St Kilda East, linking St Kilda Junction and Balaclava Station to the foreshore via Fitzroy, Carlisle and Acland Streets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; City of Port Philip also created directional signage systems that makes use of the already existing street furniture such as trash cans to help provide for 130 directional indicators across Port Melbourne.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:NumberSetinC.svg|thumb|[[Subset]]s of the [[complex numbers]].]]
A '''number''' is a [[mathematical object]] used to [[counting|count]], [[measurement|measure]] and also [[nominal number|label]]. The original examples are the [[natural number]]s [[1]], [[2]], [[3]], [[4]] and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=number, n. |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/129082 |journal=OED Online |language=en-GB |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notational [[symbol]] that represents a number is called a [[numeral system|numeral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date= |title=numeral, adj. and n. |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/129111 |journal=OED Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with [[telephone number]]s), for ordering (as with [[serial number]]s), and for codes (as with [[ISBN]]s). In common usage, ''number'' may refer to a symbol, a [[numeral (linguistics)|word]], or a [[mathematical abstraction]].

In [[mathematics]], the notion of number has been extended over the centuries to include [[0]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/history-of-zero/ |title=The Origin of Zero |last=Matson |first=John |work=Scientific American|access-date=2017-05-16 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[negative number]]s,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6HlhlBuQUgC&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A History of Mathematics: From Mesopotamia to Modernity |last=Hodgkin |first=Luke |date=2005-06-02 |publisher=OUP Oxford |year= |isbn=9780191523830 |location= |pages=85–88 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[rational number]]s such as [[one half|{{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}}}]] and {{math|−{{sfrac|2|3}}}}, [[real number]]s&lt;ref&gt;T.K.

Their study or usage is called [[arithmetic]]. The same term may also refer to [[number theory]], the study of the properties of numbers.

Besides their practical uses, numbers have cultural significance throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Gilsdorf"&gt;Gilsdorf, Thomas E. ''Introduction to Cultural Mathematics: With Case Studies in the Otomies and Incas'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Feb 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Restivo"&gt;Restivo, S. ''Mathematics in Society and History'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Nov 30, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Western society, the number [[13 (number)|13]] is regarded as unlucky, and "a [[1,000,000|million]]" may signify "a lot."&lt;ref name="Gilsdorf" /&gt; Though it is now regarded as [[pseudoscience]], [[numerology]], the belief in a mystical significance of numbers, permeated ancient and medieval thought.&lt;ref name="Ore"&gt;Ore, Oystein. ''Number Theory and Its History'', Courier Dover Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerology heavily influenced the development of [[Greek mathematics]], stimulating the investigation of many problems in number theory which are still of interest today.&lt;ref name="Ore" /&gt;

During the 19th century, mathematicians began to develop many different abstractions which share certain properties of numbers and may be seen as extending the concept. Among the first were the [[hypercomplex number]]s, which consist of various extensions or modifications of the complex number system. Today, number systems are considered important special examples of much more general categories such as [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and the application of the term "number" is a matter of convention, without fundamental significance.&lt;ref&gt;Gouvea, Fernando Q. ''[[The Princeton Companion to Mathematics]], Chapter II.1, "The Origins of Modern Mathematics"'', p. 82. Princeton University Press, September 28, 2008. {{isbn|978-0691118802}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numerals==
{{main article|Numeral system}}
Numbers should be distinguished from '''numerals''', the symbols used to represent numbers. The Egyptians invented the first ciphered numeral system, and the Greeks followed by mapping their counting numbers onto Ionian and Doric alphabets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chrisomalis |first=Stephen |date=2003-09-01 |title=The Egyptian origin of the Greek alphabetic numerals |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/egyptian-origin-of-the-greek-alphabetic-numerals/B21F16056A89CCDF000EE98CAC4E43AE |journal=Antiquity |volume=77 |issue=297 |pages=485–96 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00092541 |issn=0003-598X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman numerals, a system that used combinations of letters from the Roman alphabet, remained dominant in Europe until the spread of the superior [[Arabic numeral system]] around the late 14th century, and the Arabic numeral system remains the most common system for representing numbers in the world today.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dOxl71w-jHEC&amp;pg=PA192 |title=The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History, Volume 1 |last2=Crossley |first2=Pamela |last3=Headrick, |first3=Daniel |last4=Hirsch |first4=Steven |last5=Johnson |first5=Lyman |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2010 |isbn=1439084742 |page=192 |quote=Indian mathematicians invented the concept of zero and developed the "Arabic" numerals and system of place-value notation used in most parts of the world today |first1=Richard |last1=Bulliet}}{{better source|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key to the effectiveness of the system was the symbol for zero, which was developed by ancient  [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]] around 500 AD.&lt;ref name="Cengage Learning2" /&gt;

=={{anchor|Classification}}Main classification==
{{Redirect|Number system|systems for expressing numbers|Numeral system}}
{{See also|List of types of numbers}}Numbers can be classified into [[set (mathematics)|sets]], called '''number systems''', such as the [[natural numbers]] and the [[real numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;"Eine Menge, ist die Zusammenfassung bestimmter, wohlunterschiedener Objekte unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens – welche Elemente der Menge genannt werden – zu einem Ganzen." [http://www.brinkmann-du.de/mathe/fos/fos01_03.htm &lt;nowiki&gt;[1]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The major categories of numbers are as follows:&lt;center&gt;
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align: center; width: 400px; height: 200px;"
|+ Main number systems

!&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}_1&lt;/math&gt; are sometimes used.

![[Complex number|Complex]]

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

There is generally no problem in identifying each number system with a proper subset of the next one (by [[abuse of notation#Equality vs. isomorphism|abuse of notation]]), because each of these number systems is [[canonical isomorphism|canonically isomorphic]] to a proper subset of the next one.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} The resulting hierarchy allows, for example, to talk, formally correctly, about real numbers that are rational numbers, and is expressed symbolically by writing
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Natural numbers===
{{Main article|Natural number}}
[[File:Nat num.svg|thumb|The natural numbers, starting with 1]]
The most familiar numbers are the [[natural number]]s (sometimes called whole numbers or counting numbers): 1, 2, 3, and so on. Traditionally, the sequence of natural numbers started with&amp;nbsp;1 (0 was not even considered a number for the [[Ancient Greeks]].) However, in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, [[set theory|set theorists]] and other mathematicians started including&amp;nbsp;0 ([[cardinality]] of the [[empty set]], i.e. 0&amp;nbsp;elements, where&amp;nbsp;0 is thus the smallest [[cardinal number]]) in the set of natural numbers.&lt;ref&gt;
{{MathWorld|title=Natural Number|id=NaturalNumber}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural%20number |title=natural number |work=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=4 October 2014}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, different mathematicians use the term to describe both sets, including&amp;nbsp;0 or not. The [[mathematical symbol]] for the set of all natural numbers is '''N''', also written &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, and sometimes &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}_0&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}_1&lt;/math&gt; when it is necessary to indicate whether the set should start with 0 or 1, respectively.

In the [[base 10]] numeral system, in almost universal use today for mathematical operations, the symbols for natural numbers are written using ten [[numerical digit|digits]]: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. The radix or base is the number of unique numerical digits, including zero, that a numeral system uses to represent numbers (for the decimal system, the radix is 10).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=Base System |url=https://www.chalkstreet.com/aptipedia/knowledgebase/base-system/ |website=www.chalkstreet.com |date=29 June 2016 | access-date = 31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this base&amp;nbsp;10 system, the rightmost digit of a natural number has a [[place value]] of&amp;nbsp;1, and every other digit has a place value ten times that of the place value of the digit to its right.

In [[set theory]], which is capable of acting as an axiomatic foundation for modern mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Suppes |first=Patrick |authorlink=Patrick_Suppes |title=Axiomatic Set Theory |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1972 |page=1 |isbn=0-486-61630-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; natural numbers can be represented by classes of equivalent sets. For instance, the number&amp;nbsp;3 can be represented as the class of all sets that have exactly three elements. Alternatively, in [[Peano Arithmetic]], the number&amp;nbsp;3 is represented as sss0, where s is the "successor" function (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;3 is the third successor of&amp;nbsp;0). Many different representations are possible; all that is needed to formally represent&amp;nbsp;3 is to inscribe a certain symbol or pattern of symbols three times.

===Integers===
{{Main article|Integer}}
The [[negative number|negative]] of a positive integer is defined as a number that produces&amp;nbsp;0 when it is added to the corresponding positive integer. Negative numbers are usually written with a negative sign (a [[minus sign]]). As an example, the negative of&amp;nbsp;7 is written&amp;nbsp;−7, and {{nowrap|7 + (−7) {{=}} 0}}. When the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of negative numbers is combined with the set of natural numbers (including&amp;nbsp;0), the result is defined as the set of [[integer]]s, '''Z''' also written [[Blackboard bold|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;.]] Here the letter Z comes {{ety|de|Zahl|number}}. The set of integers forms a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with the operations addition and multiplication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Mathworld|Integer|Integer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The natural numbers form a [[subset]] of the integers. As there is no common standard for the inclusion or not of zero in the natural numbers, the natural numbers without zero are commonly referred to as '''positive integers''', and the natural numbers with zero are referred to as '''non-negative integers'''.

===Rational numbers===
{{Main article|Rational number}}
A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] with an integer numerator and a positive integer denominator. Negative denominators are allowed, but are commonly avoided, as every rational number is equal to a fraction with positive denominator. Fractions are written as two integers, the numerator and the denominator, with a dividing bar between them. The fraction {{sfrac|''m''|''n''}} represents ''m'' parts of a whole divided into ''n'' equal parts. Two different fractions may correspond to the same rational number; for example {{sfrac|1|2}} and {{sfrac|2|4}} are equal, that is:
: &lt;math&gt;{1 \over 2} = {2 \over 4}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general,
:&lt;math&gt;{a \over b} = {c \over d}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;{ a \times d} = {c \times b}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[absolute value]] of ''m'' is greater than ''n'' (supposed to be positive), then the absolute value of the fraction is greater than&amp;nbsp;1. Fractions can be greater than, less than, or equal to&amp;nbsp;1 and can also be positive, negative, or&amp;nbsp;0. The set of all rational numbers includes the integers, since every integer can be written as a fraction with denominator&amp;nbsp;1. For example&amp;nbsp;−7 can be written&amp;nbsp;{{sfrac|−7|1}}. The symbol for the rational numbers is '''Q''' (for ''[[quotient]]''), also written [[Blackboard bold|&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;.]]

===Real numbers===
{{Main article|Real number}}

The symbol for the real numbers is '''R''', also written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}.&lt;/math&gt; They include all the measuring numbers. Every real number corresponds to a point on the [[number line]]. The following paragraph will focus primarily on positive real numbers. The treatment of negative real numbers is according to the general rules of arithmetic and their denotation is simply prefixing the corresponding positive numeral by  a [[minus sign]], e.g. -123.456.

Most real numbers can only be ''approximated'' by [[decimal]] numerals, in which a [[decimal point]] is placed to the right of the digit with place value&amp;nbsp;1. Each digit to the right of the decimal point has a place value one-tenth of the place value of the digit to its left. For example, 123.456 represents {{sfrac|123456|1000}}, or, in words, one hundred, two tens, three ones, four tenths, five hundredths, and six thousandths. A real number can be expressed by a finite number of decimal digits only if it is rational and its [[fractional part]] has a denominator whose prime factors are 2 or 5 or both, because these are the prime factors of 10, the base of the decimal system. Thus, for example, one half is 0.5, one fifth is 0.2, one tenth is 0.1, and one fiftieth is 0.02.  Representing other real numbers as decimals would require an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point. If this infinite sequence of digits follows a pattern, it can be written with an ellipsis, or another notation that indicates the repeating pattern.  Such a decimal is called a [[repeating decimal]]. Thus {{sfrac|3}} can be written as 0.333..., with an ellipsis to indicate that the pattern continues. Forever repeating 3s are also written as 0.{{overline|3}}.

It turns out that these repeating decimals (including the repetition of zeroes) denote exactly the rational numbers, i.e., all rational numbers are also real numbers, but it is not the case that every real number is rational. A real number that is not rational is called [[irrational number|irrational]]. A famous irrational real number is the number [[pi|{{pi}}]], the ratio of the [[circumference]] of any circle to its [[diameter]]. When pi is written as
:&lt;math&gt;\pi = 3.14159265358979\dots,&lt;/math&gt;
as it sometimes is, the ellipsis does not mean that the decimals repeat (they do not), but rather that there is no end to them. It has been proved that [[proof that pi is irrational|{{pi}} is irrational]]. Another well known number, proven to be an irrational real number, is
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} = 1.41421356237\dots,&lt;/math&gt;
the [[square root of 2]], that is, the unique positive real number whose square is 2. Both these numbers have been approximated (by computer) to trillions {{nowrap|( 1 trillion {{=}}  10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} 1,000,000,000,000 )}} of digits.

Not only these prominent examples, but [[almost all]] real numbers are irrational and therefore have no repeating patterns and hence no corresponding decimal numeral. They can only be approximated by decimal numerals, denoting [[rounding|rounded]] or [[truncation|truncated]] real numbers. Any rounded or truncated number is necessarily a rational number, of which there are only [[countably many]]. All measurements are, by their nature, approximations, and always  have a [[margin of error]]. Thus 123.456 is considered an approximation of any real number greater or equal to {{sfrac|1234555|10000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|1234565|10000}} (rounding to 3 decimals), or of any real number  greater or equal to {{sfrac|123456|1000}} and strictly less than {{sfrac|123457|1000}} (truncation after the 3. decimal). Digits that suggest a greater accuracy than the measurement itself does, should be removed. The remaining digits are then called [[significant digits]]. For example, measurements with a ruler can seldom be made without a margin of error of at least 0.001&amp;nbsp;meters. If the sides of a [[rectangle]] are measured as 1.23&amp;nbsp;meters and 4.56&amp;nbsp;meters, then multiplication gives an area for the rectangle between {{nowrap|5.614591 square meters}} and {{nowrap|5.603011 square meters}}. Since not even the second digit after the decimal place is preserved, the following digits are not ''significant''. Therefore the result is usually rounded to 5.61.

Just as the same fraction can be written in more than one way, the same real number may have more than one decimal representation. For example, [[0.999...]], 1.0, 1.00, 1.000, ..., all represent the natural number&amp;nbsp;1. A given real number has only the following decimal representations: an approximation to some finite number of decimal places, an approximation in which a pattern is established that continues for an unlimited number of decimal places, or an exact value with only finitely many decimal places.  In this last case, the last non-zero digit may be replaced by the digit one smaller followed by an unlimited number of 9's, or the last non-zero digit may be followed by an unlimited number of zeros.  Thus the exact real number 3.74 can also be written 3.7399999999... and 3.74000000000... . Similarly, a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 0's can be rewritten by dropping the 0's to the right of the decimal place, and a decimal numeral with an unlimited number of 9's can be rewritten by increasing the rightmost non-9 digit by one, changing all the 9's to the right of that digit to 0's. Finally, an unlimited sequence of 0's to the right of the decimal place can be dropped. For example, 6.849999999999... = 6.85 and 6.850000000000... = 6.85.  Finally, if all of the digits in a numeral are 0, the number is 0, and if all of the digits in a numeral are an unending string of 9's, you can drop the nines to the right of the decimal place, and add one to the string of 9s to the left of the decimal place.  For example 99.999... = 100. 

The real numbers also have an important but highly technical property called the [[least upper bound]] property.

It can be shown that any [[ordered field]], which is also [[completeness of the real numbers|complete]], is isomorphic to the real numbers. The real numbers are not, however, an [[algebraically closed field]], because they do not include a solution (often called a [[square root of minus one]]) to the algebraic equation &lt;math&gt; x^2+1=0&lt;/math&gt;.

===Complex numbers===
{{Main article|Complex number}}
Moving to a greater level of abstraction, the real numbers can be extended to the [[complex number]]s. This set of numbers arose historically from trying to find closed formulas for the roots of [[cubic function|cubic]] and [[quadratic function|quadratic]] polynomials. This led to expressions involving the square roots of negative numbers, and eventually to the definition of a new number: a [[square root]] of&amp;nbsp;−1, denoted by ''[[imaginary unit|i]]'', a symbol assigned by [[Leonhard Euler]], and called the [[imaginary unit]]. The complex numbers consist of all numbers of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\,a + b i&lt;/math&gt;
where ''a'' and ''b'' are real numbers. Because of this, complex numbers correspond to points on the [[complex plane]], a [[vector space]] of two real [[dimension]]s. In the expression {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, the real number ''a'' is called the [[real part]] and ''b'' is called the [[imaginary part]]. If the real part of a complex number is&amp;nbsp;0, then the number is called an [[imaginary number]] or is referred to as ''purely imaginary''; if the imaginary part is&amp;nbsp;0, then the number is a real number. Thus the real numbers are a [[subset]] of the complex numbers. If the real and imaginary parts of a complex number are both integers, then the number is called a [[Gaussian integer]]. The symbol for the complex numbers is '''C''' or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] asserts that the complex numbers form an [[algebraically closed field]], meaning that every [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has a [[zero of a function|root]] in the complex numbers. Like the reals, the complex numbers form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], which is [[complete space|complete]], but unlike the real numbers, it is not [[total order|ordered]]. That is, there is no consistent meaning assignable to saying that ''i'' is greater than&amp;nbsp;1, nor is there any meaning in saying that ''i'' is less than&amp;nbsp;1. In technical terms, the complex numbers lack of a [[total order]] that is [[ordered field|compatible with field operations]].

==Subclasses of the integers==

===Even and odd numbers===
{{main article|Even and odd numbers}}
An '''even number''' is an integer that is "evenly divisible" by two, that is [[Euclidean division|divisible by two without remainder]]; an '''odd number''' is an integer that is not even. (The old-fashioned term "evenly divisible" is now almost always shortened to "[[divisibility|divisible]]".) Any odd number ''n'' may be constructed by the formula {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2''k'' + 1,}} for a suitable integer ''k''. Starting with {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} 0,}} the first non-negative odd numbers are {1, 3, 5, 7, ...}. Any even number ''m'' has the form {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} 2''k''}} where ''k'' is again an [[integer]]. Similarly, the first non-negative even numbers are {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}.

===Prime numbers===
{{main article|Prime number}}
A '''prime number''' is an integer greater than 1 that is not the product of two smaller positive integers. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. There is no such simple formula as for odd and even numbers to generate the prime numbers. The primes have been widely studied for more than 2000 years and have led to many questions, only some of which have been answered.  The study of these questions belong to [[number theory]].  An example of a still unanswered question is, whether every even number is the sum of two primes.  This is called [[Goldbach's conjecture]].

The question, whether every integer greater than one is a product of primes in only one way, except for a rearrangement of the primes, has been answered to the positive: this proven claim is called [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. A proof appears in [[Euclid's Elements]].

===Other classes of integers===
Many subsets of the natural numbers have been the subject of specific studies and have been named, often after the first mathematician that has studied them. Example of such sets of integers are [[Fibonacci number]]s and [[perfect number]]s. For more examples, see [[Integer sequence]].

==Subclasses of the complex numbers==

===Algebraic, irrational and transcendental numbers===
[[Algebraic number]]s are those that are a solution to a polynomial equation with integer coefficients. Real numbers that are not rational numbers are called [[irrational number]]s. Complex numbers which are not algebraic are called [[transcendental number]]s. The algebraic numbers that are solutions of a [[monic polynomial]] equation with integer coefficients are called [[algebraic integer]]s.

===Computable numbers===
{{Main article|Computable number}}
A '''computable number''', also known as ''recursive number'', is a [[real number]] such that there exists an [[algorithm]] which, given a positive number ''n'' as input, produces the first ''n'' digits of the computable number's decimal representation. Equivalent definitions can be given using [[μ-recursive function]]s, [[Turing machines]] or [[λ-calculus]]. The computable numbers are stable for all usual arithmetic operations, including the computation of the roots of a [[polynomial]], and thus form a [[real closed field]] that contains the real [[algebraic number]]s.

The computable numbers may be viewed as the real numbers that may be exactly represented in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason is that there is no algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.

The set of computable numbers has the same cardinality as the natural numbers. Therefore, [[almost all]] real numbers are non-computable. However, it is very difficult to produce explicitly a real number that is not computable.

==Extensions of the concept==

===''p''-adic numbers===
{{main article|p-adic number|l1=''p''-adic number}}
The ''p''-adic numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the left of the decimal point, in the same way that real numbers may have infinitely long expansions to the right. The number system that results depends on what [[radix|base]] is used for the digits: any base is possible, but a [[prime number]] base provides the best mathematical properties. The set of the ''p''-adic numbers contains the rational numbers, but is not contained in the complex numbers.

The elements of an [[algebraic function field]] over a [[finite field]] and algebraic numbers have many similar properties (see [[Function field analogy]]). Therefore, they are often regarded as numbers by number theorists. The ''p''-adic numbers play an important role in this analogy.

===Hypercomplex numbers===
{{main article|hypercomplex number}}
Some number systems that are not included in the complex numbers may be constructed from the real numbers in a way that generalize the construction of the complex numbers. They are sometimes called [[hypercomplex number]]s. They include the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', introduced by Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]], in which multiplication is not [[commutative]], the [[octonion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[associative]] in addition to not being commutative, and the [[sedenion]]s, in which multiplication is not [[Alternative algebra|alternative]], neither associative nor commutative.

===Transfinite numbers===
{{main article|transfinite number}}
For dealing with infinite [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the natural numbers have been generalized to the [[ordinal number]]s and to the [[cardinal number]]s. The former gives the ordering of the set, while the latter gives its size. For finite sets, both ordinal and cardinal numbers are identified with the natural numbers. In the infinite case, many ordinal numbers correspond to the same cardinal number.

===Nonstandard numbers===
[[Hyperreal number]]s are used in [[non-standard analysis]]. The hyperreals, or nonstandard reals (usually denoted as *'''R'''), denote an [[ordered field]] that is a proper [[Field extension|extension]] of the ordered field of [[real number]]s '''R''' and satisfies the [[transfer principle]]. This principle allows true [[first-order logic|first-order]] statements about '''R''' to be reinterpreted as true first-order statements about *'''R'''.

[[Superreal number|Superreal]] and [[surreal number]]s extend the real numbers by adding infinitesimally small numbers and infinitely large numbers, but still form [[field (mathematics)|fields]].

A [[relation number]] is defined as the class of [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] consisting of all those relations that are similar to one member of the class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |authorlink=Bertrand_Russell |title=Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy |publisher=Routledge |year=1919 |page=56 |ISBN=0-415-09604-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=unclear definition that is red linked. Is this notion notable enough for appearing here?|date=November 2014}}

==History==

===First use of numbers===
{{main article|History of ancient numeral systems}}
Bones and other artifacts have been discovered with marks cut into them that many believe are [[tally marks]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshak, A., ''The Roots of Civilisation; Cognitive Beginnings of Man’s First Art, Symbol and Notation'', (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, London: 1972), 81ff.&lt;/ref&gt; These tally marks may have been used for counting elapsed time, such as numbers of days, lunar cycles or keeping records of quantities, such as of animals.

A tallying system has no concept of place value (as in modern [[decimal]] notation), which limits its representation of large numbers. Nonetheless tallying systems are considered the first kind of abstract numeral system.

The first known system with place value was the [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|Mesopotamian base&amp;nbsp;60]] system ([[circa|ca.]] 3400&amp;nbsp;BC) and the earliest known base&amp;nbsp;10 system dates to 3100&amp;nbsp;BC in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/Ancient-Africa/mad_ancient_egyptpapyrus.html#berlin |title=Egyptian Mathematical Papyri – Mathematicians of the African Diaspora |publisher=Math.buffalo.edu |accessdate=2012-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zero {{anchor|History of zero}}===
The first known documented use of zero dates to AD 628, and appeared in the ''[[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]]'', the main work of the [[Indian mathematician]] [[Brahmagupta]].  He treated&amp;nbsp;0 as a number and discussed operations involving it, including [[division by zero|division]]. By this time (the 7th&amp;nbsp;century) the concept had clearly reached Cambodia as [[Khmer numerals]], and documentation shows the idea later spreading to [[China]] and the [[Islamic world]].

[[File:Khmer Numerals - 605 from the Sambor inscriptions.jpg|thumb|The number 605 in [[Khmer numerals]], from an inscription from 683 AD. An early use of zero as a decimal figure.]]

Brahmagupta's Brahmasphuṭasiddhanta is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is usually considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. He gave rules of using zero with negative and positive numbers, such as 'Zero plus a positive number is the positive number, and a negative number plus zero is the negative number'. The Brahmasphutasiddhanta is the earliest known text to treat zero as a number in its own right, rather than as simply a placeholder digit in representing another number as was done by the Babylonians or as a symbol for a lack of quantity as was done by Ptolemy and the Romans.

The use of 0 as a number should be distinguished from its use as a placeholder numeral in [[place-value system]]s. Many ancient texts used&amp;nbsp;0. Babylonian and Egyptian texts used it. Egyptians used the word ''nfr'' to denote zero&amp;nbsp;balance in [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double entry accounting]]. Indian texts used a [[Sanskrit]] word {{lang|sa-Latn|Shunye}} or {{lang|sa|shunya}} to refer to the concept of ''void''. In mathematics texts this word often refers to the number zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |title=Historia Matematica Mailing List Archive: Re: [HM&amp;#93; The Zero Story: a question |publisher=Sunsite.utk.edu |date=1999-04-26 |accessdate=2012-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112073735/http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/historia/apr99/0197.html |archivedate=2012-01-12 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, [[Pāṇini]] (5th century BC) used the null (zero) operator in the [[Ashtadhyayi]], an early example of an [[formal grammar|algebraic grammar]] for the Sanskrit language (also see [[Pingala]]).

There are other uses of zero before Brahmagupta, though the documentation is not as complete as it is in the Brahmasphutasiddhanta.

Records show that the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] seemed unsure about the status of&amp;nbsp;0 as a number: they asked themselves "how can 'nothing' be something?" leading to interesting [[philosophical]] and, by the Medieval period, religious arguments about the nature and existence of&amp;nbsp;0 and the [[vacuum]]. The [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]] of [[Zeno of Elea]] depend in part on the uncertain interpretation of&amp;nbsp;0. (The ancient Greeks even questioned whether&amp;nbsp;{{num|1}} was a number.)

The late [[Olmec]] people of south-central [[Mexico]] began to use a symbol for zero, a shell [[glyph]], in the New World, possibly by the {{nowrap|4th century BC}} but certainly by 40&amp;nbsp;BC, which became an integral part of [[Maya numerals]] and the [[Maya calendar]]. Mayan arithmetic used base&amp;nbsp;4 and base&amp;nbsp;5 written as base&amp;nbsp;20. Sanchez in 1961 reported a base&amp;nbsp;4, base&amp;nbsp;5 "finger" abacus.

By 130 AD, [[Ptolemy]], influenced by [[Hipparchus]] and the Babylonians, was using a symbol for&amp;nbsp;0 (a small circle with a long overbar) within a sexagesimal numeral system otherwise using alphabetic [[Greek numerals]]. Because it was used alone, not as just a placeholder, this [[Greek numerals#Hellenistic zero|Hellenistic zero]] was the first ''documented'' use of a true zero in the Old World. In later [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] manuscripts of his ''Syntaxis Mathematica'' (''Almagest''), the Hellenistic zero had morphed into the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[omicron]] (otherwise meaning&amp;nbsp;70).

Another true zero was used in tables alongside [[Roman numerals#Zero|Roman numerals]] by 525 (first known use by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]), but as a word, {{lang|la|nulla}} meaning ''nothing'', not as a symbol. When division produced&amp;nbsp;0 as a remainder, {{lang|la|nihil}}, also meaning ''nothing'', was used. These medieval zeros were used by all future medieval [[computus|computists]] (calculators of [[Easter]]). An isolated use of their initial, N, was used in a table of Roman numerals by [[Bede]] or a colleague about 725, a true zero symbol.

===Negative numbers {{anchor|History of negative numbers}}===
{{further information|History of negative numbers}}
The abstract concept of negative numbers was recognized as early as 100–50 BC in China.  ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' contains methods for finding the areas of figures; red rods were used to denote positive [[coefficient]]s, black for negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Staszkow |first=Ronald |author2=Robert Bradshaw |title=The Mathematical Palette (3rd ed.) |publisher=Brooks Cole |year=2004 |page=41 |isbn=0-534-40365-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first reference in a Western work was in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century AD in [[Greece]]. [[Diophantus]] referred to the equation equivalent to {{nowrap|4''x'' + 20 {{=}} 0}} (the solution is negative) in ''[[Arithmetica]]'', saying that the equation gave an absurd result.

During the 600s, negative numbers were in use in [[India]] to represent debts. Diophantus' previous reference was discussed more explicitly by Indian mathematician [[Brahmagupta]], in ''[[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]]'' 628, who used negative numbers to produce the general form [[quadratic formula]] that remains in use today. However, in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century in India, [[Bhāskara II|Bhaskara]] gives negative roots for quadratic equations but says the negative value "is in this case not to be taken, for it is inadequate; people do not approve of negative roots."

[[Europe]]an mathematicians, for the most part, resisted the concept of negative numbers until the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, although [[Fibonacci]] allowed negative solutions in financial problems where they could be interpreted as debts (chapter&amp;nbsp;13 of ''[[Liber Abaci]]'', 1202) and later as losses (in {{lang|la|Flos}}). At the same time, the Chinese were indicating negative numbers by drawing a diagonal stroke through the right-most non-zero digit of the corresponding positive number's numeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=David Eugene |authorlink=David_Eugene_Smith |title=History of Modern Mathematics |publisher=Dover Publications |year=1958 |page=259 |isbn=0-486-20429-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of negative numbers in a European work was by [[Nicolas Chuquet]] during the 15th&amp;nbsp;century. He used them as [[exponent]]s, but referred to them as "absurd numbers".

As recently as the 18th century, it was common practice to ignore any negative results returned by equations on the assumption that they were meaningless, just as [[René Descartes]] did with negative solutions in a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].

===Rational numbers {{anchor|History of rational numbers}}===
It is likely that the concept of fractional numbers dates to [[prehistoric times]]. The [[Ancient Egyptians]] used their [[Egyptian fraction]] notation for rational numbers in mathematical texts such as the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] and the [[Kahun Papyrus]]. Classical Greek and Indian mathematicians made studies of the theory of rational numbers, as part of the general study of [[number theory]]. The best known of these is [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], dating to roughly 300&amp;nbsp;BC. Of the Indian texts, the most relevant is the [[Sthananga Sutra]], which also covers number theory as part of a general study of mathematics.

The concept of [[decimal fraction]]s is closely linked with decimal place-value notation; the two seem to have developed in tandem. For example, it is common for the Jain math sutra to include calculations of decimal-fraction approximations to [[pi]] or the [[square root of 2]]. Similarly, Babylonian math texts had always used sexagesimal (base&amp;nbsp;60) fractions with great frequency.

===Irrational numbers {{anchor|History of irrational numbers}}===
{{further information|History of irrational numbers}}
The earliest known use of irrational numbers was in the [[Indian mathematics|Indian]] [[Sulba Sutras]] composed between 800 and 500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-last=Selin |editor-first=Helaine |editor-link=Helaine Selin |title=Mathematics across cultures: the history of non-Western mathematics |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |year=2000 |page=451 |isbn=0-7923-6481-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first existence proofs of irrational numbers is usually attributed to [[Pythagoras]], more specifically to the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] [[Hippasus|Hippasus of Metapontum]], who produced a (most likely geometrical) proof of the irrationality of the [[square root of 2]]. The story goes that Hippasus discovered irrational numbers when trying to represent the square root of 2 as a fraction. However Pythagoras believed in the absoluteness of numbers, and could not accept the existence of irrational numbers. He could not disprove their existence through logic, but he could not accept irrational numbers, and so, allegedly and frequently reported, he sentenced Hippasus to death by drowning, to impede spreading of this disconcerting news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology |chapter=Horace and the Monuments: A New Interpretation of the Archytas ''Ode'' |author=Bernard Frischer |editor=D.R. Shackleton Bailey |editorlink=D. R. Shackleton Bailey |page=83 |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-674-37935-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century brought final European acceptance of [[negative number|negative]] integral and [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] numbers. By the 17th&amp;nbsp;century, mathematicians generally used decimal fractions with modern notation. It was not, however, until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century that mathematicians separated irrationals into algebraic and transcendental parts, and once more undertook scientific study of irrationals. It had remained almost dormant since [[Euclid]]. In 1872, the publication of the theories of [[Karl Weierstrass]] (by his pupil [[E. Kossak]]), [[Eduard Heine]] (''[[Crelle's Journal|Crelle]],'' 74), [[Georg Cantor]] (Annalen, 5), and [[Richard Dedekind]] was brought about. In 1869, [[Charles Méray]] had taken the same point of departure as Heine, but the theory is generally referred to the year 1872. Weierstrass's method was completely set forth by [[Salvatore Pincherle]] (1880), and Dedekind's has received additional prominence through the author's later work (1888) and endorsement by [[Paul Tannery]] (1894). Weierstrass, Cantor, and Heine base their theories on infinite series, while Dedekind founds his on the idea of a [[Dedekind cut|cut (Schnitt)]] in the system of [[real number]]s, separating all [[rational number]]s into two groups having certain characteristic properties. The subject has received later contributions at the hands of Weierstrass, [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] (''Crelle'', 101), and Méray.

The search for roots of [[Quintic equation|quintic]] and higher degree equations was an important development, the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] ([[Paolo Ruffini|Ruffini]] 1799, [[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] 1824) showed that they could not be solved by [[nth root|radicals]] (formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence it was necessary to consider the wider set of [[algebraic numbers]] (all solutions to polynomial equations). [[Évariste Galois|Galois]] (1832) linked polynomial equations to [[group theory]] giving rise to the field of [[Galois theory]].

[[Continued fraction]]s, closely related to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), received attention at the hands of [[Euler]], and at the opening of the 19th&amp;nbsp;century were brought into prominence through the writings of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]]. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by [[Druckenmüller]] (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and Günther (1872). Ramus (1855) first connected the subject with [[determinant]]s, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine, [[August Ferdinand Möbius|Möbius]], and Günther, in the theory of Kettenbruchdeterminanten.

===Transcendental numbers and reals {{anchor|History of transcendental numbers and reals}}===
{{further information|History of π}}

The existence of transcendental numbers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bogomolny |first=A. |authorlink=Cut-the-Knot |title=What's a number? |work=Interactive Mathematics Miscellany and Puzzles |url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/numbers.shtml |accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was first established by [[Joseph Liouville|Liouville]] (1844, 1851). [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]] proved in 1873 that ''e'' is transcendental and [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]] proved in 1882 that π is transcendental. Finally, [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|Cantor]] showed that the set of all [[real number]]s is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]] but the set of all [[algebraic number]]s is [[countable|countably infinite]], so there is an uncountably infinite number of transcendental numbers.

===Infinity and infinitesimals {{anchor|History of infinity and infinitesimals}}===
{{further information|History of infinity}}
The earliest known conception of mathematical [[infinity]] appears in the [[Yajur Veda]], an ancient Indian script, which at one point states, "If you remove a part from infinity or add a part to infinity, still what remains is infinity." Infinity was a popular topic of philosophical study among the [[Jain]] mathematicians c. 400&amp;nbsp;BC. They distinguished between five types of infinity: infinite in one and two directions, infinite in area, infinite everywhere, and infinite perpetually.

[[Aristotle]] defined the traditional Western notion of mathematical infinity. He distinguished between [[actual infinity]] and [[potential infinity]]—the general consensus being that only the latter had true value. [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''[[Two New Sciences]]'' discussed the idea of [[bijection|one-to-one correspondences]] between infinite sets. But the next major advance in the theory was made by [[Georg Cantor]]; in 1895 he published a book about his new [[set theory]], introducing, among other things, [[transfinite number]]s and formulating the [[continuum hypothesis]].

In the 1960s, [[Abraham Robinson]] showed how infinitely large and infinitesimal numbers can be rigorously defined and used to develop the field of nonstandard analysis. The system of [[hyperreal numbers]] represents a rigorous method of treating the ideas about [[infinity|infinite]] and [[infinitesimal]] numbers that had been used casually by mathematicians, scientists, and engineers ever since the invention of [[infinitesimal calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]].

A modern geometrical version of infinity is given by [[projective geometry]], which introduces "ideal points at infinity", one for each spatial direction. Each family of parallel lines in a given direction is postulated to converge to the corresponding ideal point. This is closely related to the idea of vanishing points in [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] drawing.

===Complex numbers {{anchor|History of complex numbers}}===
{{further information|History of complex numbers}}
The earliest fleeting reference to square roots of negative numbers occurred in the work of the mathematician and inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] in the {{nowrap|1st century AD}}, when he considered the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]]. They became more prominent when in the 16th&amp;nbsp;century closed formulas for the roots of third and fourth degree polynomials were discovered by Italian mathematicians such as [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]] and [[Gerolamo Cardano]]. It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers.

This was doubly unsettling since they did not even consider negative numbers to be on firm ground at the time. When [[René Descartes]] coined the term "imaginary" for these quantities in 1637, he intended it as derogatory. (See [[imaginary number]] for a discussion of the "reality" of complex numbers.) A further source of confusion was that the equation
:&lt;math&gt;\left ( \sqrt{-1}\right )^2 =\sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}=-1&lt;/math&gt;
seemed capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a}\sqrt{b}=\sqrt{ab},&lt;/math&gt;
which is valid for positive real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', and was also used in complex number calculations with one of ''a'', ''b'' positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity, and the related identity
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{a}}&lt;/math&gt;
in the case when both ''a'' and ''b'' are negative even bedeviled [[Euler]]. This difficulty eventually led him to the convention of using the special symbol ''i'' in place of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt; to guard against this mistake.

The 18th century saw the work of [[Abraham de Moivre]] and [[Leonhard Euler]]. [[De Moivre's formula]] (1730) states:
:&lt;math&gt;(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)^{n} = \cos n \theta + i\sin n \theta &lt;/math&gt;
while [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]] (1748) gave us:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \theta + i\sin \theta = e ^{i\theta }. &lt;/math&gt;

The existence of complex numbers was not completely accepted until [[Caspar Wessel]] described the geometrical interpretation in 1799. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] rediscovered and popularized it several years later, and as a result the theory of complex numbers received a notable expansion. The idea of the graphic representation of complex numbers had appeared, however, as early as 1685, in [[John Wallis|Wallis]]'s ''De Algebra tractatus''.

Also in 1799, Gauss provided the first generally accepted proof of the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], showing that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a full set of solutions in that realm. The general acceptance of the theory of complex numbers is due to the labors of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]], and especially the latter, who was the first to boldly use complex numbers with a success that is well known.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] studied [[Gaussian integer|complex numbers of the form]] {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi''}}, where ''a'' and ''b'' are integral, or rational (and ''i'' is one of the two roots of {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 {{=}} 0}}). His student, [[Gotthold Eisenstein]], studied the type {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bω''}}, where ''ω'' is a complex root of {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} 0.}} Other such classes (called [[cyclotomic fields]]) of complex numbers derive from the [[roots of unity]] {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 {{=}} 0}} for higher values of ''k''. This generalization is largely due to [[Ernst Kummer]], who also invented [[ideal number]]s, which were expressed as geometrical entities by [[Felix Klein]] in 1893.

In 1850 [[Victor Alexandre Puiseux]] took the key step of distinguishing between poles and branch points, and introduced the concept of [[mathematical singularity|essential singular points]]. This eventually led to the concept of the [[extended complex plane]].

===Prime numbers {{anchor|History of prime numbers}}===
[[Prime number]]s have been studied throughout recorded history. Euclid devoted one book of the ''Elements'' to the theory of primes; in it he proved the infinitude of the primes and the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and presented the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for finding the [[greatest common divisor]] of two numbers.

In 240 BC, [[Eratosthenes]] used the [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] to quickly isolate prime numbers. But most further development of the theory of primes in Europe dates to the [[Renaissance]] and later eras.

In 1796, [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] conjectured the [[prime number theorem]], describing the asymptotic distribution of primes. Other results concerning the distribution of the primes include Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges, and the [[Goldbach conjecture]], which claims that any sufficiently large even number is the sum of two primes. Yet another conjecture related to the distribution of prime numbers is the [[Riemann hypothesis]], formulated by [[Bernhard Riemann]] in 1859. The [[prime number theorem]] was finally proved by [[Jacques Hadamard]] and [[Charles de la Vallée-Poussin]] in 1896. Goldbach and Riemann's conjectures remain unproven and unrefuted.

The '''Oxford Oath''', or '''Oxford Pledge''', is the name commonly given to a resolution carried by students of the [[Oxford Union]] that "this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country". It was passed by 275 votes to 153 at [[the King and Country debate]] on 9 February 1933.&lt;ref name="times-online"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The resolution "made a lot of noise in the world"&lt;ref name="st.petersburg"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; and "caused reverberations around the world".&lt;ref name="times-online" /&gt; It has been claimed by one [[Joseph Alsop]] that the resolution made a tremendous impression upon [[Adolf Hitler]]; he regularly cited it when his general staff protested against his military decisions.&lt;ref name="st.petersburg" /&gt;

[[Winston Churchill]], later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], denounced the resolution as "that abject, squalid, shameless avowal". In the knowledge that ten days beforehand Hitler had become [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|chancellor]] of [[Germany]], he continued:

{{Quote|text=I think of Germany, with its splendid clear-eyed youths marching forward on all the roads of the [[Reich]] singing their ancient songs, demanding to be [[conscripted]] into an army; eagerly seeking the most terrible weapons of war; burning to suffer and die for their fatherland. I think of [[Italy]], with her ardent [[Fascisti]], her renowned Chief, and stern sense of national duty. I think of France, anxious, peace-loving, pacifist to the core, but armed to the teeth and determined to survive as a great nation in the world. One can almost feel the curl of contempt upon the lips of the manhood of these peoples when they read this message sent out by [[Oxford University]] in the name of young [[England]].|author=Winston Churchill|source=&lt;ref name="times-online" /&gt;}}

===US oath===
On 12 April 1935, 60,000 college students signed a [[United States]] equivalent of the resolution, calling it the Oxford Oath, swearing never to take up arms on behalf of king or country.&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;https://www.jstor.org/pss/3641185&lt;/ref&gt; At Columbia University, 3,000 students took the Oath that day during a rally featuring [[Roger Nash Baldwin|Roger Baldwin]], [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] and [[James Wechsler]] as speakers.&lt;ref name="leter2editor"&gt;http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/nov99/nov99_letterseditor.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
The official framed copy of the oath was stolen in 2004.&lt;ref name="times-online" /&gt;

The abbreviation PII is widely accepted in the U.S. context, but the phrase it abbreviates has four common variants based on ''personal''  / ''personally'', and ''identifiable'' / ''identifying''. Not all are equivalent, and for legal purposes the effective definitions vary depending on the jurisdiction and the purposes for which the term is being used. (In other countries with privacy protection laws derived from the OECD privacy principles, the term used is more often "personal information", which may be somewhat broader: in Australia's ''Privacy Act ''1988 (Cth) "personal information" also includes information from which the person's identity is "reasonably ascertainable", potentially covering some information not covered by PII.)

Under European and other data protection regimes, which centre primarily around the [[General Data Protection Regulation]], the term "personal data" is significantly broader, and determines the scope of the regulatory regime.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Paul M|last2=Solove|first2=Daniel|date=2014|title=Reconciling Personal Information in the United States and European Union |url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/californialawreview/vol102/iss4/7/|journal=California Law Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=4|pages=|doi=10.15779/Z38Z814|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] Special Publication 800-122&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf|title=NIST Special Publication 800-122|author=|date=|website=nist.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines PII as "any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including (1) any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, or biometric records; and (2) any other information that is linked or linkable to an individual, such as medical, educational, financial, and employment information." So, for example, a user's IP address is not classed as PII on its own, but is classified as linked PII.&lt;ref&gt;Section 3.3.3 “Identifiability”&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of PII has become prevalent as [[information technology]] and the [[Internet]] have made it easier to collect PII leading to a profitable market in collecting and reselling PII. PII can also be exploited by criminals to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[identity theft|steal the identity]] of a person, or to aid in the planning of criminal acts. As a response to these threats, many website [[privacy policy|privacy policies]] specifically address the gathering of PII,{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} and lawmakers{{who|date=April 2013}} have enacted a series of legislation{{which|date=February 2018}} to limit the distribution and accessibility of PII.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

However, PII is a legal concept, not a technical concept, and as noted, it is not utilised in all jurisdictions. Because of the versatility and power of modern re-identification algorithms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre|author2=César A.

== NIST definition ==
The following data, often used for the express purpose of distinguishing individual identity, clearly classify as PII under the definition used by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (described in detail below):&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;{{cite web
| url=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-122.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Full name]] (if not common)
* [[Face]] (sometimes)
* [[Address (geography)|Home address]]
* [[Email address]]
* [[National identification number]] (e.g., [[Social Security number]] in the U.S.)
* [[Passport]] number
* [[Vehicle registration plate]] number
* [[Driver's license]] number
* [[Face]], [[fingerprint]]s, or [[handwriting]]
* [[Credit card number]]s
* [[Digital identity]]
* [[Date of birth]]
* [[Birthplace]]
* [[Genetics|Genetic information]]
* [[Telephone number]]
* [[User (computing)|Login name]], screen name, [[nickname]], or [[Pseudonym|handle]]

The following are less often used to distinguish individual identity, because they are traits shared by many people.
However, they are potentially PII, because they may be combined with other personal information to identify an individual.

* First or last name, if common
* Country, state, [[postcode]] or city of residence
* Age, especially if non-specific
* [[Gender]] or race
* Name of the school they attend or workplace
* Grades, salary, or job position
* [[Criminal record]]
* [[Web cookie]]&lt;ref name=LN01&gt;{{cite web|title=Anonymity and PII|url=http://cookieresearch.com/anonymityandpii|website=cookieresearch.com|accessdate=6 May 2015|ref=LN01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a person wishes to remain anonymous, descriptions of them will often employ several of the above, such as "a 34-year-old white male who works at Target". Note that information can still be ''private'', in the sense that a person may not wish for it to become publicly known, without being personally identifiable. Moreover, sometimes multiple pieces of information, none sufficient by itself to uniquely identify an individual, may uniquely identify a person when combined; this is one reason that multiple pieces of evidence are usually presented at criminal trials. It has been shown that, in 1990, 87% of the population of the United States could be uniquely identified by gender, [[ZIP code]], and full date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] and [[Internet slang]], the practice of finding and releasing such information is called "[[doxing]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=James Wray and Ulf Stabe |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/articles/The-FBIs-warning-about-doxing-was-too-little-too-late |title=The FBI's warning about doxing was too little too late |publisher=Thetechherald.com |date=2011-12-19 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/276610/20120104/anonymous-operation-hiroshima-inside-doxing-coup.htm |title=Anonymous's Operation Hiroshima: Inside the Doxing Coup the Media Ignored (VIDEO) |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2012-01-01 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes used to deter collaboration with law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/technology/2011/07/did-lulzsec-trick-police-arresting-wrong-guy/40522/ |title=Did LulzSec Trick Police Into Arresting the Wrong Guy? - Technology |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, the doxing can trigger an arrest, particularly if law enforcement agencies suspect that the "doxed" individual may panic and disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bright |first=Peter |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/03/doxed-how-sabu-was-outed-by-former-anons-long-before-his-arrest.ars |title=Doxed: how Sabu was outed by former Anons long before his arrest |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2012-03-07 |accessdate=2012-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In privacy law==
The U.S. government used the term "personally identifiable" in 2007 in a memorandum from the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget (OMB),&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-16.pdf M-07-16 SUBJECT:Safeguarding Against and Responding to the Breach of Personally Identifiable Information] FROM: Clay Johnson III, Deputy Director for Management (2007/05/22)&lt;/ref&gt; and that usage now appears in US standards such as the [[NIST]] ''Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information'' (SP 800-122).&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;  The OMB memorandum defines PII as follows:

{{cquote|''Information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, biometric records, etc. alone, or when combined with other personal or identifying information which is linked or linkable to a specific individual, such as date and place of birth, mother’s maiden name, etc.''}}

A term similar to PII, "personal data" is defined in EU directive 95/46/EC, for the purposes of the directive:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML |title=Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''Article 2a: 'personal data' shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity;''}}

However, in the EU rules, there has been a clearer notion that the data subject can potentially be identified through additional processing of other attributes—quasi- or pseudo-identifiers. In an early draft of the EU [[General Data Protection Regulation]], this was formalized in Article 4, but was omitted in the final version: a "data subject" is one "who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by means reasonably likely to be used by the controller or by any other natural or legal person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P7-TA-2014-0212+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN|title=Texts adopted - Wednesday, 12 March 2014 - Protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data ***I - P7_TA(2014)0212|author=|date=|website=www.europarl.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[General Data Protection Regulation|GDPR]] became enforceable on 25 May 2018.

Another term similar to PII, "personal information" is defined in a section of the California data breach notification law, SB1386:&lt;ref name="California"&gt;{{cite web
| url= http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/01-02/bill/sen/sb_1351-1400/sb_1386_bill_20020926_chaptered.html
| title=Text of California Senate Bill SB 1386 ref paragraph SEC. 2 1798.29.(e)
| publisher=California
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''(e) For purposes of this section, "personal information" means an individual's first name or first initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the following data elements, when either the name or the data elements are not encrypted:  (1) Social security number. (2) Driver's license number or California Identification Card number. (3) Account number, credit or debit card number, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account. (f) For purposes of this section, "personal information" does not include publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from federal, state, or local government records.''}}

The concept of information combination given in the SB1386 definition is key to correctly distinguishing PII, as defined by OMB, from "personal information", as defined by SB1386.  Information, such as a name, that lacks context cannot be said to be SB1386 "personal information", but it must be said to be PII as defined by OMB. For example, the name [[Placeholder name|John Smith]] has no meaning in the current context and is therefore not SB1386 "personal information", but it is PII. A [[Social Security Number]] (SSN) without a name or some other associated identity or context information is not SB1386 "personal information", but it is PII. For example, the SSN 078-05-1120 by itself is PII, but it is not SB1386 "personal information". However the combination of a valid name with the correct SSN is SB1386 "personal information".&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

The combination of a name with a context may also be considered PII; for example, if a person's name is on a list of patients for an HIV clinic.  However, it is not necessary for the name to be combined with a context in order for it to be PII.  The reason for this distinction is that bits of information such as names, although they may not be sufficient by themselves to make an identification, may later be combined with other information to identify persons and expose them to harm.

According to the OMB, it is not always the case that PII is "sensitive", and context may be taken into account in deciding whether certain PII is or is not sensitive.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"/&gt;{{full citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Australia ===
In Australia, the [[Privacy Act 1988]] deals with the protection of individual privacy, using the OECD Privacy Principles from the 1980s to set up a broad, principles-based regulatory model (unlike in the US, where coverage is generally not based on broad principles but on specific technologies, business practices or data items). Section 6 has the relevant definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/pa1988108/s6.html|title=Privacy Act 1988|accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical detail is that the definition of 'personal information' also applies to where the individual can be indirectly identified:

{{quote|"personal information" means information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, ''or can reasonably be ascertained'', from the information or opinion. [emphasis added]}}

This raises the question of reasonableness: assume it is theoretically possible to identify a person from core information which say does NOT include a simple name and address, but does contain clues which could be pursued to ascertain who it relates to. Just how much extra effort or difficulty would such a step need before we could clearly say that the identity could NOT be "reasonably ascertained" from it?

{{quote|For instance, if the information involves an IP address, and the relevant ISP stores logs which could easily be inspected (if you had sufficient legal justification) to re-link the IP address to the account holder, can their identity be "reasonably ascertained"? If such linking used to be expensive, slow and difficult, but becomes easier, does this change the answer at some point?}}

It appears that this definition is significantly broader than the Californian example given above, and thus that Australian privacy law, while in some respects weakly enforced, may cover a broader category of data and information than in some US law.
In particular, online behavioral advertising businesses based in the US but surreptitiously collecting information from people in other countries in the form of cookies, bugs, trackers and the like may find that their preference to avoid the implications of wanting to build a psychographic profile of a particular person using the rubric of 'we don't collect personal information' may find that this does not make sense under a broader definition like that in the Australian Privacy Act.

=== Canada ===
* [[Privacy Act (Canada)|Privacy Act]] governs the Federal Government agencies
* [[Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (Ontario)|Ontario Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act]] and similar Provincial legislation governs Provincial Government agencies.
* [[Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act]] governs private corporations, unless there is equivalent Provincial legislation
* [[Personal Health Information Protection Act|Ontario Personal Health Information Protection Act]] and other similar Provincial legislation governs health information

===New Zealand===
The twelve Information Privacy Principles of the [[Right to privacy in New Zealand|Privacy Act 1993]] apply.

=== Switzerland ===

The [[Federal Act on Data Protection]] of 19 June 1992 (in force since 1993) has set up a strict protection of privacy by prohibiting virtually any processing of personal data which is not expressly authorized by the data subjects.&lt;ref name=FADP&gt;[https://www.admin.ch/opc/en/classified-compilation/19920153/index.html Federal Act on Data Protection of 19 June 1992 (status as of 1 January 2014)], [[Federal Chancellery of Switzerland]] (page visited on 18 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The protection is subject to the authority of the [[Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner]].&lt;ref name=FADP/&gt;

Additionally, any person may ask in writing a company (managing data files) the correction or deletion of any personal data.&lt;ref name=Amarelle&gt;{{fr}} Cesla Amarelle, ''Droit suisse'', Éditions Loisirs et pédagogie, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The company must respond within thirty days.&lt;ref name=Amarelle/&gt;

=== United States ===
The [[Privacy Act of 1974]] (Pub.L. 93–579, 88 Stat. 1896, enacted December 31, 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a), a United States federal law, establishes a Code of Fair Information Practice that governs the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information about individuals that is maintained in systems of records by federal agencies.

One of the primary focuses of the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA), is to protect a patient's [[Protected Health Information]] (PHI), which is similar to PII. The U.S. Senate proposed the [[Privacy Act of 2005]], which attempted to strictly limit the display, purchase, or sale of PII without the person's consent. Similarly, the (proposed) [[Anti-Phishing Act of 2005]] attempted to prevent the acquiring of PII through [[phishing]].

U.S. lawmakers have paid special attention to the [[social security number]] because it can be easily used to commit [[identity theft]]. The (proposed) [[Social Security Number Protection Act of 2005]] and (proposed) [[Identity Theft Prevention Act of 2005]] each sought to limit the distribution of an individual's social security number.

== Forensics ==
In [[forensics]], particularly the identification and prosecution of criminals, personally identifiable information is critical in establishing evidence in [[criminal procedure]]. Criminals may go to great trouble to avoid leaving any PII,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} such as by:
* wearing masks, sunglasses, or clothing to obscure or completely hide distinguishing features, such as [[retinal scan|eye]], skin, and hair colour, facial features, and personal marks such as tattoos, birthmarks, moles and scars.
&lt;!-- Examples regarding physical appearance merged into single bullet
* they wear [[mask]]s (faces and hair are PII).
* wearing [[sunglasses]] (eye color and [[retinal scan|retinae]] are PII).&lt;ref&gt;http://riots2011.epetitions.net/ Ban the bandana, hoodies and sunglasses after dark&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility}}
* wearing clothing that covers personal marks such as [[tattoo]]s, [[birthmark]]s, [[Melanocytic nevus|moles]] and [[scar]]s. --&gt;
* wearing gloves to conceal [[fingerprint]]s, which themselves are PII. However, gloves can also leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting [[glove prints]], law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sawer |first=Patrick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/3740688/Police-use-glove-prints-to-catch-criminals.html |title=Police use glove prints to catch criminals |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2008-12-13 |accessdate=2013-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[jurisdictions]] the act of wearing gloves itself while committing a crime can be prosecuted as an [[inchoate offense]].&lt;ref name=McCord&gt;James W.H. McCord and Sandra L. McCord, ''Criminal Law and Procedure for the paralegal: a systems approach'', ''supra'', p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Weasel-word justification of presence and emotionally purposed statements
* wearing [[gloves]] ([[fingerprint]]s are PII). Since the advent of fingerprint detection, many criminals{{who}} have resorted to the wearing of gloves in order to avoid leaving fingerprints, which thus makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints. After collecting [[glove prints]], law enforcement can then match them to gloves that they have collected as evidence.--&gt;
* avoiding writing anything in their own [[handwriting]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
* masking their internet presence with methods such as using a [[proxy server]] to appear to be connecting from an [[IP address]] unassociated with oneself.

== Personal safety ==
In some professions, it is dangerous for a person's identity to become known, because this information might be exploited violently by their enemies; for example, their enemies might hunt them down or kidnap loved ones to force them to cooperate. For this reason, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) has strict policies controlling release of PII of DoD personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]] have similar policies, sometimes to the point where employees do not disclose to their friends that they work for the agency.

Similar identity protection concerns exist for [[witness protection]] programs, [[women's shelter]]s, and victims of domestic violence and other threats.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[Guru Nanak]], the founder of [[Sikhism]], described a hierarchy of five spiritual levels in the [[Japji Sahib]].&lt;ref name = "Mansukhani"&gt;{{cite book |title =Introduction to Sikhism|pages = 71|first = Gobind Singh|last = Mansukhani| year = 1977|publisher = Hemkunt Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest level in this hierarchy is known as the Sach Khand where the individual attains a mystical union with God.&lt;ref name = "Mansukhani" /&gt; Before reaching the level of Sach Khand, the individual must ascend progressively through four lower levels—starting from Dharam Khand, and progressing through Gian Khand, Saram Khand, and Karam Khand.&lt;ref name = "Mansukhani" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14267">'''School-related gender-based violence in Viet Nam''' refers to [[Violence|physical]], [[Sexual violence|sexual]], psychosocial and [[Verbal abuse|verbal violence]] that takes place in the [[Education in Vietnam|Vietnamese education system]]. Different forms of [[School-related gender-based violence|School-related gender-based violence (SRGBV)]] interact and overlap. Bullying, for instance, occurs when there is an imbalance of power between the “bully” and the “bullied” and can happen through physical contact, verbal attacks, social exclusion, and psychological manipulation. Students are bullied when they are repeatedly and intentionally exposed to harmful and/or aggressive behaviour that results in injury or discomfort.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246928e.pdf|title=Reaching Out: Preventing and Addressing SOGIE-related School Violence in Viet Nam, volume 2|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=15, 21, 27-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scale ==
Global, regional and local research demonstrates that schools and other educational institutions in Viet Nam are not always safe and inclusive spaces for children and young people. Many schools are sites of physical, verbal, psychosocial and sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Pinheiro P. (2006). World Report on Violence against Children.

New York: UNICEF. &lt;/ref&gt; This violence appears to be on the rise with incidents reported to the Department of Child Care and Protection hotline increasing by a factor of 13 in the last decade.&lt;ref&gt;Nhan, Dan (2013).

(2011). School Bullying and Power Relations in Vietnam [Thesis].

== Studies ==
In 2013 the Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) showed that approximately one in six students, aged 13-17 years, reported being in a physical fight one or more times during the last 12 months, with this behaviour being more common for boys (26%) than girls (10%).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation &amp; Hanoi Medical University. (2013). Global School-based Student Health Survey: Vietnam 2013 Fact Sheet. Hanoi: WHO. &lt;/ref&gt; Reported experiences of bullying, one or more days within the last 30 days, were however similar for boys and girls (23% and 24% respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Quang Dao, V.

School Violence in Hanoi, Vietnam. Singapore National University. &lt;/ref&gt;

Viet Nam has also had some research studies about violence against LGBT students, including a field survey carried out by CCIHP with 520 LGBT people with the average age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;Hershberger, S. L., &amp; D’Augelli, A. R. (1995). The impact of victimization on the mental health and suicidality of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths. Developmental Psychology, 31, 65–74. &lt;/ref&gt; This study revealed that 41% of LGBT participants suffered from discrimination and violence in either schools or universities. [[Save the Children]] Vietnam and the Institute of Social and Medical Studies completed a separate study on 170 LGBT young adults which found that discrimination against these children (at home and school) contributed to their increased risk of homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children. (2015). Child Rights Situation Analysis. Ha Noi: Viet Nam Country Office. &lt;/ref&gt; They were at high risk of violence at home, school and on the streets. Only 15.9% of the LGBT youth participants had a post-secondary school education, 47.8% had only a lower secondary education, 27.6% had only a primary school education, and 8.7% had no schooling at all.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One study conducted by the Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment (iSEE) involving 2,363 respondents from 63 provinces in Viet Nam found that one in three respondents felt that they had been subject to discrimination because of their sexual orientation and gender identity within 12 months preceding the survey, with a high degree of frequency.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Luong,T.H.,&amp;Pham,Q,P.(2015).Is it because I am LGBT?: Discriminations on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Vietnam. Ha Noi: The Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment. &lt;/ref&gt; The study also reported that transgender people experience the highest degree of discrimination. This study focused its analysis on the discrimination experienced by LGBT people in families, schools, workplaces, healthcare settings and housing, among other aspects. Looking specifically at the school setting, the study found that nearly a quarter of students had been harassed, bullied by teachers and/or school officials because they were considered to be LGBT. Gender indicative uniforms proved to be a significant obstacle for transgender people, affecting their quality of learning and their mental health. In light of the findings, some recommendations specific to the education sector included: 1) School psychological counseling models need to pre-empt the psychological and physical development of students to provide well-timed educational support; 2) Create extracurricular programs that respond to the needs of students; 3) Respect students’ choice of uniform to fit with their desired gender and; 4) Educate faculties about the LGBT community.

[[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan International]] Viet Nam, in cooperation with the Ha Noi Department of Education and Training (DOET), [[Center for Research and Applied Sciences in Gender, Family, Women and Adolescents]] [[(CSAGA)]], and the [[International Center for Research on Women|International Centre for Research on Women]] (ICRW), has implemented a “Gender Responsive School Pilot Model project” meant to prevent and respond to SRGBV. The 3-year project (2014-2016), funded by UNTF and Plan International involves 20 secondary/high schools in Ha Noi. The intervention provides teacher training on gender equality, SRGBV, and reproductive health to encourage lessons on related topics to be integrated into the curriculum. The intervention also encourages the formation of youth leadership organizations and awareness-raising activities with parents. A key component of the project is the establishment of a psychological counselling room at the participating schools. To date, nearly 2,300 students have received individualized counselling and over 4,100 students have received group counselling. The project has found that while only 6% of students in Viet Nam know about a public hotline for counselling, 21% of the total students in the 20 schools of the project have sought counselling services.&lt;ref&gt;Plan International Viet Nam.

== Prevention ==
The National Policy Framework for Gender Equality was approved for the period 2011-2020 with the goal of highlighting the importance of gender equality for the socio-economic development of the country, including in education efforts towards this end. Furthermore, unlike many of its neighbours, Viet Nam now no longer has a ban on same-sex marriage, and has indeed never had punitive laws around either male or female same-sex relations.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, R. (2015). Vietnam Removes Same-Sex Marriage Ban. Metro Weekly. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.metroweekly.com/2015/01/&lt;/nowiki&gt; vietnam-removes-same-sex-marriage- &lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Viet Nam passed a landmark law by a vote of 282-84 in 2015 enshrining transgender people’s right to legal recognition of a gender identity other than that indicated by their sex rights for transgender people and paving the way to allow those who have undergone gender reassignment to register their legal identity under their new sex.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, D. (2015). Vietnam passes landmark law recognizing transgender people: ban on gender reassignment surgery has also been lifted. Gay Star News. Retrieved from http:// www.gaystarnews.com/article/vietnam- passes-landmark-law-recognizing-transgender- people/#gs.UibaoY0 &lt;/ref&gt; Along with these strategies, a National Targeted Program on Gender Equality was developed for the period of 2011 to 2015 and as Viet Nam moves forward with new strategies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, there is a clear opportunity for evaluation and reflection on current conditions around SOGIE in education.&lt;ref&gt;Pistor, N., &amp; Quy, L.

{{emotion}}
'''Shyness''' (also called '''diffidence''') is the [[feeling]] of [[fear|apprehension]], [[discomfort|lack of comfort]], or [[awkwardness]] especially when a person is around other people. This commonly occurs in new situations or with unfamiliar people. Shyness can be a characteristic of people who have low [[self-esteem]]. Stronger forms of shyness are usually referred to as [[social anxiety]] or [[social phobia]].
The primary defining characteristic of shyness is a largely ego-driven fear of what other people will think of a person's behavior. This results in a person becoming scared of doing or saying what they want to out of fear of negative reactions, being laughed at, humiliated or patronised, criticism or rejection. A shy person may simply opt to avoid social situations instead.&lt;ref name="RCP"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Royal College of Psychiatrists | year = 2012 | title = Shyness and social phobia | url = http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/mentalhealthinfo/problems/anxietyphobias/shynessandsocialphobia.aspx |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important aspect of shyness is social skills development. Schools and parents may implicitly ''assume'' children are fully capable of effective social interaction. Social skills training is not given any priority (unlike reading and writing) and as a result, shy students are not given an opportunity to develop their ability to participate in class and interact with peers. Teachers can model social skills and ask questions in a less direct and intimidating manner in order to gently encourage shy students to speak up in class, and make friends with other children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/02568540809594634| title = The Stresses of a "Brave New World": Shyness and School Adjustment in Kindergarten| journal = Journal of Research in Childhood Education| volume = 22| issue = 4| pages = 377–389| year = 2008| last1 = Coplan | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Arbeau | first2 = K. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==

The initial cause of shyness varies. Scientists believe that they have located genetic data supporting the [[hypothesis]] that shyness is, at least, partially genetic. However, there is also evidence that suggests the environment in which a person is raised can also be responsible for their shyness. This includes [[child abuse]], particularly [[emotional abuse]] such as ridicule. Shyness can originate after a person has experienced a physical [[anxiety]] reaction; at other times, shyness seems to develop first and then later causes physical symptoms of anxiety. Shyness differs from [[social anxiety]], which is a broader, often [[clinical depression|depression]]-related psychological condition including the experience of [[fear]], apprehension or worrying about being evaluated by others in social situations to the extent of inducing [[panic]].

Shyness may come from genetic traits, the environment in which a person is raised and personal experiences. Shyness may be a personality trait or can occur at certain stages of development in children.

=== Genetics and heredity ===

Shyness is often seen as a hindrance to people and their development. The cause of shyness is often disputed but it is found that [[fear]] is positively related to shyness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15250000902839971 | title = Development of Shyness: Relations with Children's Fearfulness, Sex, and Maternal Behavior | year = 2009 | last1 = Eggum | first1 = Natalie | last2 = Eisenberg | first2 = Nancy | last3 = Spinrad | first3 = Tracy | last4 = Reiser | first4 = Mark | last5 = Gaertner | first5 = Bridget | last6 = Sallquist | first6 = Julie | last7 = Smith | first7 = Cynthia | journal = Infancy | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 325–345 | pmid = 20011459 | pmc = 2791465}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggesting that fearful children are much more likely to develop being shy as opposed to children less fearful. Shyness can also be seen on a biological level as a result of an excess of [[cortisol]]. When cortisol is present in greater quantities it is known to suppress an individual's immune system, making them more susceptible to illness and disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/h0087100 | title = Shyness and symptoms of illness in young children | year = 2000 | last1 = Chung | first1 = Joanna Y.Y. | last2 = Evans | first2 = Mary Ann | journal = Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science | volume = 32 | pages = 49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetics of shyness is a relatively small area of research that has been receiving an even smaller amount of attention, although papers on the biological bases of shyness date back to 1988. Some research has indicated that shyness and [[aggression]] are related—through long and short forms of the [[gene]] [[Dopamine receptor D4|DRD4]], though considerably more research on this is needed.  Further, it has been suggested that shyness and [[social anxiety|social phobia]] (the distinction between the two is becoming ever more blurred) are related to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. As with other studies of [[behavioral genetics]], the study of shyness is complicated by the number of genes involved in, and the confusion in defining, the [[phenotype]].  Naming the phenotype – and translation of terms between genetics and [[psychology]] — also causes problems.

Several genetic links to shyness are current areas of research.  One is the [[serotonin]] transporter promoter region polymorphism ([[5-HTTLPR]]), the long form of which has been shown to be modestly correlated with shyness in grade school children.&lt;ref name="ArbelleS2003Relation"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Shoshana |last1=Arbelle |first2=Jonathan |last2=Benjamin |first3=Moshe |last3=Golin |first4=Ilana |last4=Kremer |first5=Robert H. |last5=Belmaker |first6=Richard P. |last6=Ebstein |title=Relation of shyness in grade school children to the genotype for the long form of the serotonin transporter promoter region polymorphism |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=160 |issue=4 |pages=671–676 |date=April 2003 |pmid=12668354 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.4.671}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies had shown a connection between this form of the gene and both obsessive-compulsive disorder and [[autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17151167 | year = 2006 | last1 = Brune | first1 = CW | last2 = Kim | first2 = SJ | last3 = Salt | first3 = J | last4 = Leventhal | first4 = BL | last5 = Lord | first5 = C | last6 = Cook Jr | first6 = EH | title = 5-HTTLPR Genotype-Specific Phenotype in Children and Adolescents with Autism | volume = 163 | issue = 12 | pages = 2148–56 | doi = 10.1176/ajp.2006.163.12.2148 | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Model organism#Vertebrates|Mouse model]]s have also been used, to derive genes suitable for further study in humans; one such gene, the [[L-glutamic acid decarboxylase|glutamic acid decarboxylase]] gene (which encodes an [[enzyme]] that functions in [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA synthesis]]), has so far been shown to have some association with behavioral inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smoller |first1=Jordan W. |last2=Rosenbaum |first2=Jerold F. |last3=Biederman |first3=Joseph |last4=Susswein |first4=Lisa S. |last5=Kennedy |first5=John |last6=Kagan |first6=Jerome |last7=Snidman |first7=Nancy |last8=Laird |first8=Nan |last9=Tsuang |first9=Ming T. |last10=Faraone |first10=Stephen V. |last11=Schwarz |first11=Alysandra |last12=Slaugenhaupt |first12=Susan A. |title=Genetic association analysis of behavioral inhibition using candidate loci from mouse models |journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics |year=2001 |volume=105 |pages=226–235 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1328 |pmid=11353440 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another gene, the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4) exon III polymorphism, had been the subject of studies in both shyness and aggression and is currently the subject of studies on the "novelty seeking" trait. A 1996 study of anxiety-related traits (shyness being one of these) remarked that, "Although twin studies have indicated that individual variation in measures of anxiety-related personality traits is 40-60% heritable, none of the relevant genes has yet been identified", and that "10 to 15 genes might be predicted to be involved" in the anxiety trait. Progress has been made since then, especially in identifying other potential genes involved in personality traits, but there has been little progress made towards confirming these relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lesch |first1=Klaus-Peter |last2=Bengal |first2=Dietmar |last3=Heils |first3=Armin |last4=Sabol |first4=Sue Z. |last5=Greenberg |first5=Benjamin D. |last6=Petri |first6=Susanne |last7=Benjamin |first7=Jonathan |last8=Muller |first8=Clemens R. |last9=Hamer |first9=Dean H. |last10=Murphy |first10=Dennis L. |title=Association of anxiety-related traits with a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene regulatory region |journal=Science |year=1996 |volume=274 |issue=5292 |pages=1527–1531 |bibcode=1996Sci...274.1527L |doi=10.1126/science.274.5292.1527 |pmid=8929413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The long version of the 5-HTT gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR) is now postulated to be correlated with shyness,&lt;ref name="ArbelleS2003Relation"/&gt; but in the 1996 study, the short version was shown to be related to anxiety-based traits.

=== As a symptom of mercury poisoning ===

Excessive shyness, embarrassment, self-consciousness and timidity, social-phobia and lack of self-confidence are also components of [[erethism]], which is a symptom complex that appears in cases of [[mercury poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;WHO (1976) Environmental Health Criteria 1: Mercury, Geneva, [[World Health Organization]], 131 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WHO. Inorganic mercury. Environmental Health Criteria 118. World Health Organization, Geneva, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mercury poisoning was common among hat makers in England in the 18th and 19th centuries, who used mercury to stabilize wool into felt fabric.

=== Prenatal development ===

The prevalence of shyness in some children can be linked to day length during [[pregnancy]], particularly during the midpoint of prenatal development.&lt;ref name=daylength&gt;Gortmaker, SL. et al. ''Daylength during pregnancy and shyness in children: results from northern and southern hemispheres''. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of longitudinal data from children living at specific latitudes in the [[United States]] and [[New Zealand]] revealed a significant relationship between hours of day length during the midpoint of pregnancy and the prevalence of shyness in children. "The odds of being classified as shy were 1.52 times greater for children exposed to shorter compared to longer daylengths during gestation."&lt;ref name=daylength /&gt; In their analysis, scientists assigned conception dates to the children relative to their known birth dates, which allowed them to obtain random samples from children who had a mid-gestation point during the longest hours of the year and the shortest hours of the year (June and December, depending on whether the cohorts were in the United States or New Zealand).

The longitudinal survey data included measurements of shyness on a five-point scale based on interviews with the families being surveyed, and children in the top 25th percentile of shyness scores were identified. The data revealed a significant co-variance between the children who presented as being consistently shy over a two-year period, and shorter day length during their mid-prenatal development period. "Taken together, these estimates indicate that about one out of five cases of extreme shyness in children can be associated with gestation during months of limited daylength."&lt;ref name=daylength /&gt;

=== Low birth weights ===

In recent years correlations between birth weight and shyness have been studied. Findings suggest that those born at low birth weights are more likely to be shy, risk-aversive and cautious compared to those born at normal birth weights. These results do not however imply a cause-and-effect relationship.&lt;ref name=Us.health&gt;{{cite news|last=U.S|first=News Staff|title=Do Underweight Newborns Make for Shy Adult|url=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/articles/2008/07/09/do-underweight-newborns-make-for-shy-adults|accessdate=14 March 2013|date=9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personality trait ==

Shyness is most likely to occur during unfamiliar situations, though in severe cases it may hinder an individual in their most familiar situations and relationships as well. Shy people avoid the objects of their apprehension in order to keep from feeling uncomfortable and inept; thus, the situations remain unfamiliar and the shyness perpetuates itself.  Shyness may fade with time; e.g., a [[child]] who is shy towards strangers may eventually lose this trait when [[maturity (psychology)|older]] and become more socially adept. This often occurs by adolescence or young adulthood (generally around the age of 13). In some cases, though, it may become an integrated, lifelong [[character trait]]. Longitudinal data suggests that the three different personality types evident in infancy easy, slow-to-warm-up, and difficult tend to change as children mature. Extreme traits become less pronounced, and personalities evolve in predictable patterns over time. What has been proven to remain constant is the tendency to internalize or externalize problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Janson | first1 = H. | last2 = Matheisen | first2 = K.S. | year = 2008 | title = Temperament profiles from infancy to middle childhood: Developmentand associations with behavior problems | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 5| pages = 1314–1328 | doi=10.1037/a0012713 | pmid=18793065}}&lt;/ref&gt; This relates to individuals with shy personalities because they tend to internalize their problems, or dwell on their problems internally instead of expressing their concerns, which leads to disorders like depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coplan | first1 = R. J. | last2 = Rose-Krasnor | first2 = L. | last3 = Weeks | first3 = M. | last4 = Kingsbury | first4 = A. | last5 = Kingsbury | first5 = M. | last6 = Bullock | first6 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Alone is a crowd: Social motivations, social withdrawal, and socioemotional functioning in later childhood | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 49| issue = 5| pages =  861–875| doi = 10.1037/a0028861 | pmid=22686178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans experience shyness to different degrees and in different areas.

Shyness can also be seen as an academic [[determinant]]. It has been determined that there is a negative relationship between shyness and classroom performance. As the shyness of an individual increased, classroom performance was seen to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chisti | first1 = Saeed-ul-Hasan | last2 = Anwar | first2 = Saeed | last3 = Babar Khan | first3 = Shahinshah | year = 2011 | title = Relationship between shyness and classroom performance at graduation level in Pakistan | url = | journal = Interdisciplinary Journal of Contemporary Research in Business | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 532–538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shyness may involve the discomfort of difficulty in knowing what to say in [[social support|social]] situations, or may include crippling physical manifestations of uneasiness. Shyness usually involves a combination of both symptoms, and may be quite devastating for the sufferer, in many cases leading them to feel that they are boring, or exhibit bizarre behavior in an attempt to create interest, alienating them further. Behavioral traits in social situations such as [[smiling]], easily producing suitable [[conversation]]al topics, assuming a relaxed [[Human position|posture]] and making good [[eye contact]], may not be second nature for a shy person. Such people might only affect such traits by great difficulty, or they may even be impossible to display.

Those who are shy are perceived more negatively, in cultures that value sociability, because of the way they act towards others.&lt;ref name="P"/&gt;  Shy individuals are often distant during conversations, which can result in others forming poor impressions of them. People who are not shy may be up-front, aggressive, or critical towards shy people in an attempt "to get them out of their shell."  This can actually make a shy person feel worse, as it draws attention to them, making them more self-conscious and uncomfortable.

== Concepts ==

=== Versus introversion ===

The term shyness may be implemented as a lay blanket-term for a family of related and partially overlapping afflictions, including [[timidity]] (apprehension in meeting new people), bashfulness and diffidence (reluctance in asserting oneself), apprehension and anticipation (general fear of potential interaction), or intimidation (relating to the object of fear rather than one's low confidence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/shy |title=Shy &amp;#124; Define Shy at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparent shyness, as perceived by others, may simply be the manifestation of reservation or [[introversion]], character traits which cause an individual to voluntarily avoid excessive social contact or be terse in communication, but are not motivated or accompanied by discomfort, apprehension, or lack of confidence.

Rather, according to professor of psychology Bernardo J. Carducci, introverts ''choose'' to avoid social situations because they derive no reward from them or may find surplus sensory input overwhelming, whereas shy people may fear such situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitten |first=Meredith |url=http://psychcentral.com/library/shyness.htm |title=All About Shyness |publisher=Psych Central |date=2001-08-21 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research using the statistical techniques of factor analysis and correlation have found shyness overlaps mildly with both introversion and neuroticism (i.e., negative emotionality).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8260.1979.tb00314.x| title = Shyness as a dimension of personality| journal = British Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology| volume = 18| pages = 121–128| year = 1979| last1 = Crazier | first1 = W.

Both shyness and introversion can outwardly manifest with socially withdrawn behaviors, such as tendencies to avoid social situations, especially when they are unfamiliar. A variety of research suggests that shyness and introversion possess clearly distinct motivational forces and lead to uniquely different personal and peer reactions and therefore cannot be described as theoretically the same,&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="As"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asendorpf | first1 = J.B. | last2 = Meier | first2 = G.H. | year = 1993 | title = Personality effects on children's speech in everyday life: Sociability-mediated exposure and shyness-mediated reactivity to social situations | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 6| pages = 1072–1083 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.6.1072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CHEN"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = X. | last2 = Wang | first2 = L. | last3 = Cao | first3 = R. | year = 2011 | title = Shyness-sensitivity and unsociability in rural Chinese children: Relations with social, school, and psychological adjustment | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 82 | issue = 5| pages = 1531–1543 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01616.x | pmid=21790539}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Susan Cain]]'s ''[[Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking|Quiet]]'' (2012) further discerning introversion as involving being ''differently'' social (preferring one-on-one or small group interactions) rather than being ''anti''-social altogether.&lt;ref name="NPR20120130"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/30/145930229/quiet-please-unleashing-the-power-of-introverts |title=Quiet, Please: Unleashing 'The Power Of Introverts' |last=Cornish |first=Audie (interviewer) |date=30 January 2012 |publisher=NPR |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65trRHEMP?url=http://www.npr.org/2012/01/30/145930229/quiet-please-unleashing-the-power-of-introverts |archivedate=4 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that no unique physiological response, such as an increased heart beat, accompanies socially withdrawn behavior in familiar compared with unfamiliar social situations. But unsociability leads to decreased exposure to unfamiliar social situations and shyness causes a lack of response in such situations, suggesting that shyness and unsociability affect two different aspects of sociability and are distinct personality traits.&lt;ref name="As"/&gt; In addition, different cultures perceive unsociability and shyness in different ways, leading to either positive or negative individual feelings of self-esteem. Collectivist cultures view shyness as a more positive trait related to compliance with group ideals and self-control, while perceiving chosen isolation (introverted behavior) negatively as a threat to group harmony; and because collectivist society accepts shyness and rejects unsociability, shy individuals develop higher self-esteem than introverted individuals.&lt;ref name="CHEN"/&gt; On the other hand, individualistic cultures perceive shyness as a weakness and a character flaw, while unsociable personality traits (preference to spend time alone) are accepted because they uphold the value of autonomy; accordingly, shy individuals tend to develop low self-esteem in Western cultures while unsociable individuals develop high self-esteem.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt;

=== Versus social phobia ===

An extreme case of shyness is identified as a psychiatric illness, which made its debut as [[social phobia]] in [[DSM-III]] in 1980, but was then described as rare.&lt;ref name=Lane2007&gt;{{cite book |last=Lane |first=Christopher |year=2008 |title=Shyness: How Normal Behavior Became a Sickness |publisher=Yale University Press |place=New Haven |isbn=9780300124460}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=December 2016}} By 1994, however, when [[DSM-IV]] was published, it was given a second, alternative name in parentheses ([[social anxiety disorder]]) and was now said to be relatively common, affecting between 3 and 13% of the population at some point during their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Anxiety disorders. In Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev., pp. 450–456). Washington, D.C.: American Psychiatric Association.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ralphstone&gt;R.E. Stone. ''Is the American Psychiatric Association in Bed with Big Pharma?'' 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies examining shy adolescents and university students found that between 12 and 18% of shy individuals meet criteria for [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Shyness affects people mildly in unfamiliar social situations where one feels anxiety about interacting with new people. Social anxiety disorder, on the other hand, is a strong irrational fear of interacting with people, or being in situations which may involve public scrutiny,  because one feels overly concerned about being criticized if one embarrasses oneself. Physical symptoms of social phobia can include blushing, shortness of breath, trembling, increased heart rate, and sweating; in some cases, these symptoms are intense enough and numerous enough to constitute a [[panic attack]]. Shyness, on the other hand, may incorporate many of these symptoms, but at a lower intensity, infrequently, and does not interfere tremendously with normal living.&lt;ref name="RCP"/&gt;

=== Social versus behavioral inhibition ===

Those considered shy are also said to be ''socially inhibited''. [[Social inhibition]] is the conscious or unconscious constraint by a person of behavior of a social nature. In other words, social inhibition is holding back for social reasons. There are different levels of social inhibition, from mild to severe. Being socially inhibited is good when preventing one from harming another and bad when causing one to refrain from participating in class discussions.

''Behavioral inhibition'' is a temperament or personality style that predisposes a person to become fearful, distressed and withdrawn in novel situations. This personality style is associated with the development of [[anxiety disorders]] in adulthood, particularly [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref name="behavioral inh."&gt;{{cite web|title=Behavioral Inhibition as a childhood predictor of social anxiety, part 1|url=http://akfsa.org/research/behavioral-inhibition-as-a-childhood-predictor-of-social-anxiety-part-1/|website=Andrew Kukes foundation for social anxiety|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ordoñez-Ortega | first1 = A. | last2 = Espinosa-Fernandez | first2 = L. | last3 = Garcia-Lopez | first3 = LJ | last4 = Muela-Martinez | first4 = JA | year = 2013 | title = Behavioral Inhibition and Relationship with Childhood Anxiety Disorders/Inhibición Conductual y su Relación con los Trastornos de Ansiedad Infantil | url = | journal = Terapia Psicologica | volume = 31 | issue = 3| pages = 355–362 | doi=10.4067/s0718-48082013000300010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Misconceptions and negative aspects ==

Many misconceptions/stereotypes about shy individuals exist in western culture and negative peer reactions to "shy" behavior abound. This takes place because individualistic cultures place less value on quietness and meekness in social situations, and more often reward outgoing behaviors. Some misconceptions include viewing introversion and social phobia synonymous with shyness, and believing that shy people are less intelligent.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Paulhus |first1=D.L. |last2=Morgan |first2=K.L. |year=1997 |title=Perceptions of intelligence in leaderless groups: The dynamic effects of shyness and acquaintance |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=581–591 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.581 |pmid=9120785|citeseerx=10.1.1.586.2278 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=K. |last2=Coplan |first2=R.J. |year=2010 |title=Exploring processes linking shyness and academic achievement in childhood |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=213–222 |doi=10.1037/a0022070 |journal=School Psychology Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CH"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Coplan |first1=J.R. |last2=Hughes |first2=K. |last3=Bosacki |first3=S. |last4=Rose-Krasnor |first4=L. |year=2011 |title=Is silence golden?

=== Intelligence ===

No correlation (positive or negative) exists between intelligence and shyness.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt; Research indicates that shy children have a harder time expressing their knowledge in social situations (which most modern curricula utilize) and because they do not engage actively in discussions, teachers view them as less intelligent. In line with [[social learning theory]], an unwillingness to engage with classmates and teachers makes it more difficult for shy students to learn. Test scores, however, indicate that shyness is unrelated to actual academic knowledge, and therefore only academic engagement.&lt;ref name="HC"/&gt; Depending on the level of a teacher's own shyness, more indirect (vs. socially oriented) strategies are used with shy individuals to assess knowledge in the classroom, and accommodations are made.&lt;ref name="CH"/&gt; Observed peer evaluations of shy people during initial meeting and social interactions thereafter found that peers evaluate shy individuals as less intelligent during the first encounter. During subsequent interactions, however, peers perceived shy individuals' intelligence more positively.&lt;ref name="P"/&gt;

== Benefits ==

Thomas Benton claims that because shy people "have a tendency toward self-criticism, they are often high achievers, and not just in solitary activities like research and writing. Perhaps even more than the drive toward independent achievement, shy people long to make connections to others often through altruistic behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chronicle.com/article/ShynessAcademe/44632/ | title=Shyness and Academe | publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education | date=24 May 2004 | accessdate=20 October 2013 | author=Thomas H. Benton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Cain describes the benefits that shy people bring to society that US cultural norms devalue. Without characteristics that shy people bring to social interactions, such as sensitivity to the emotions of others, contemplation of ideas, and valuable listening skills, there would be no balance to society.&lt;ref name="NYTimesCain20110625"/&gt; In earlier generations, such as the 1950s, society perceived shyness as a more socially attractive trait, especially in women, indicating that views on shyness vary by culture.&lt;ref name="NYTimesCain20110625"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/opinion/sunday/26shyness.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=Shyness: Evolutionary Tactic? |last=Cain |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Cain |date=25 June 2011 |website=The New York Times |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iuzdd5ca?url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/opinion/sunday/26shyness.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |archivedate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Susie Scott challenged the interpretation and treatment of shyness as being pathological. "By treating shyness as an individual pathology, ... we forget that this is also a ''socially oriented'' state of mind that is ''socially'' produced and managed."&lt;ref name=Scott2007&gt;{{cite book |first=Susie |last=Scott |title=Shyness and Society: the illusion of competence |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |place=Basingstoke |year=2007 |isbn=9781403996039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} She explores the idea that "shyness is a form of deviance: a problem for society as much as for the individual", and concludes that, to some extent, "we are all impostors, faking our way through social life".&lt;ref name=Scott2007/&gt;{{rp|165,174}} One of her interview subjects (self-defined as shy) puts this point of view even more strongly: "Sometimes I want to take my cue from the militant [[Inclusion (disability rights)|disabled lobbyists]] and say, 'hey, it's not MY problem, it's society's'. I want to be proud to be shy: on the whole, shys are probably more sensitive, and nicer people, than 'normals'. I shouldn't have to change: society should adapt to meet my needs."&lt;ref name=Scott2007/&gt;{{rp|164}}

== Different cultural views ==

In cultures that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can be perceived as weakness.&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can be frustrating for the shy individual.&lt;ref name="P"/&gt; However, in other cultures, shy people may be perceived as being thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.&lt;ref name=NYTimesCain20110625/&gt;

In cultures that value autonomy, shyness is often analyzed in the context of being a social dysfunction, and is frequently contemplated as a personality disorder or mental health issue. Some researchers are beginning to study comparisons between [[individualistic]] and [[collectivistic]] cultures, to examine the role that shyness might play in matters of social etiquette and achieving group-oriented goals. "Shyness is one of the emotions that may serve as behavioral regulators of social relationships in collectivistic cultures. For example, social shyness is evaluated more positively in a collectivistic society, but negatively evaluated in an individualistic society."&lt;ref name=frijda&gt;Frijda, N.H., &amp; [[Batja Mesquita|Mesquita, B.]] ''Social roles and functions: A interaction functions of emotion.'' 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a cross-cultural study of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Canadians|Canadian]] school children, researchers sought to measure several variables related to social reputation and peer relationships, including "shyness-sensitivity." Using peer nomination questionnaire, students evaluated their fellow students using positive and negative playmate nominations. "Shyness-sensitivity was significantly and negatively correlated with measures of peer acceptance in the Canadian sample. Inconsistent with Western results, it was found that items describing shyness-sensitivity were separated from items assessing isolation in the factor structure for the Chinese sample. Shyness-sensitivity was positively associated with sociability-leadership and with peer acceptance in the Chinese sample."&lt;ref name=chinesecanadian&gt;Chen, X., Rubin, K., Sun, Y. ''Social Reputation and Peer Relationships in Chinese and Canadian Children: A Cross-Cultural Study''. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Western perceptions ===

In some Western cultures shyness-inhibition plays an important role in psychological and social adjustment. It has been found that shyness-inhibition is associated with a variety of maladaptive behaviors. Being shy or inhibited in Western cultures can result in rejection by peers, isolation and being viewed as socially incompetent by adults. However, research suggests that if social withdrawal is seen as a personal choice rather than the result of shyness, there are fewer negative connotations.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FDu7Y9tTbpYC&amp;dq=The+Development+of+Shyness+and+Social+Withdrawal |title=The Development of Shyness and Social Withdrawal |year=2010 |publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-60623-522-5|pages=213–227|editor=Kenneth H. Rubin and Robert J. Coplan |chapter=10 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer [[A. C. Benson|Arthur C. Benson]] felt shyness is not mere self-consciousness, but a primitive suspicion of strangers, the primeval belief that their motives are predatory, with shyness a sinister quality which needs to be uprooted.&lt;ref&gt;p. 162, Benson, Arthur C. 1908. ''Arthur C. Benson At Large Number XI Shyness.'' Putnam’s Monthly and The Reader, A Magazine of Literature, Art and Life. Volume IV. New Rochelle, New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, The Knickerbocker Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed the remedy is for the shy to frequent society for courage from familiarity. Also, he claimed that too many shy adults take refuge in a critical attitude, engaging in brutal onslaughts on inoffensive persons. He felt that a better way is for the shy to be nice, to wonder what others need and like, interest in what others do or are talking about, friendly questions, and sympathy.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 162-165, Benson, Arthur C. 1908. ''Arthur C. Benson At Large Number XI Shyness.'' Putnam’s Monthly and The Reader, A Magazine of Literature, Art and Life. Volume IV. New Rochelle, New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons, The Knickerbocker Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Is this author's opinion, written in 1908, really notable enough to be mentioned in this article? --&gt;&lt;!-- at least a warning to the reader would be nice! --&gt;

For Charles Darwin shyness was an ‘odd state of mind’  appearing to offer no benefit to our species, and since the 1970s the modern tendency in psychology has been to see shyness as pathology.&lt;ref name=Aeon20130717&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aeonmagazine.com/being-human/shyness-cannot-be-cured-it-is-part-of-being-human/ |title=The crystalline wall |last=Moran |first=Joe |date=17 July 2013 |website=[[Aeon (digital magazine)|Aeon]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IuyiDBo5?url=http://www.aeonmagazine.com/being-human/shyness-cannot-be-cured-it-is-part-of-being-human/ |archivedate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, evolutionary survival advantages of careful temperaments over adventurous temperaments in dangerous environments have also been recognized.&lt;ref name="NYTimesCain20110625"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aeon20130717/&gt;

=== Eastern perceptions  ===

In Eastern cultures shyness-inhibition in school-aged children is seen as positive and those that exhibit these traits are viewed well by peers and are accepted. They tended to be seen as competent by their teachers, to perform well in school and to show well-being. Shy individuals are also more likely to attain leadership status in school. Being shy or inhibited does not correlate with loneliness or depression as those in the West do. In Eastern cultures being shy and inhibited is a sign of politeness, respectfulness, and thoughtfulness.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

=== Examples of shyness and inhibition ===

In Hispanic cultures shyness and inhibition with authority figures is common. For instance, Hispanic students may feel shy towards being praised by teachers in front of others, because in these cultures students are rewarded in private with a touch, a smile, or spoken word of praise. Hispanic students may seem shy when they are not. It is considered rude to excel over peers and siblings; therefore it is common for Hispanic students to be reserved in classroom settings. Adults also show reluctance to share personal matters about themselves to authority figures such as nurses and doctors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the students' culture effects their behavior|url=http://literacynet.org/lp/hperspectives/culteffect.html|publisher=Teaching from a Hispanic perspective a handbook for non-Hispanic adult educators|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures in which the community is closed and based on agriculture (Kenya, India, etc.) experience lower social engagement than those in more open communities (United States, Okinawa, etc.) where interactions with peers is encouraged. Children in Mayan, Indian, Mexican, and Kenyan cultures are less expressive in social styles during interactions and they spend little time engaged in socio-dramatic activities. They are also less assertive in social situations. Self-expression and assertiveness in social interactions are related to shyness and inhibition in that when one is shy or inhibited one exhibits little or no expressive tendencies.&lt;ref name=book /&gt; Assertiveness is demonstrated in the same way, being shy and inhibited lessen one's chances of being assertive because of a lack of confidence.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the Italian culture emotional expressiveness during interpersonal interaction is encouraged. From a young age children engage in debates or discussions that encourage and strengthen social assertiveness. Independence and social competence during childhood is also promoted. Being inhibited is looked down upon and those who show this characteristic are viewed negatively by their parents and peers. Like other cultures where shyness and inhibition is viewed negatively, peers of shy and inhibited Italian children reject the socially fearful, cautious and withdrawn. These withdrawn and socially fearful children express loneliness and believe themselves to be lacking the social skills needed in social interactions.&lt;ref name=Rubin&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rubin|first1=Kenneth|author2=Sheryl A. Hemphill|author3=Xinyin Chen|author4=Paul Hasting|title=A cross-cultural study of behavioral inhibition in toddlers: East-West-North-South|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|date=May 2006|volume=30|series=3|pages=119–125|doi=10.1177/0165025406066723|url=http://jbd.sagepub.com/content/30/3/219.full.pdf+html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411182134/http://jbd.sagepub.com/content/30/3/219.full.pdf+html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-04-11|accessdate=22 February 2013|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intervention and treatment ==

Psychological methods and pharmaceutical drugs are commonly used to treat shyness in individuals who feel crippled because of low self-esteem and psychological symptoms, such as depression or loneliness.  According to research, early intervention methods that expose shy children to social interactions involving team work, especially team sports, decrease their anxiety in social interactions and increase their all around self-confidence later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Findlay | first1 = L.C. | last2 = Coplan | first2 = R.J. | year = 2008 | title = Come out and play: Shyness in childhood and the benefits of organized sports participation | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 153–161 | doi=10.1037/0008-400x.40.3.153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Implementing such tactics could prove to be an important step in combating the psychological effects of shyness that make living normal life difficult for anxious individuals.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7399">In [[information theory]] and telecommunication engineering, the  '''signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio''' ('''SINR'''&lt;ref name="Haenggi2009"/&gt;) (also known as the '''signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio''' ('''SNIR''')&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"/&gt;)  is a quantity used to give theoretical upper bounds on [[channel capacity]] (or the rate of information transfer) in wireless communication systems such as networks. Analogous to the SNR used often in wired communications systems, the SINR is defined as the power of a certain signal of interest divided by the sum of the [[Interference (communication)|interference]] power (from all the other interfering signals) and the power of some background noise. If the power of noise term is zero, then the SINR reduces to the [[signal-to-interference ratio]] (SIR). Conversely, zero interference reduces the SINR to the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] (SNR), which is used less often when developing [[mathematical models]] of wireless networks such as [[cellular networks]].&lt;ref name="andrews2010primer"&gt;J. G. Andrews, R. K. Ganti, M. Haenggi, N. Jindal, and S. Weber. A primer on spatial modeling and analysis in wireless networks. ''Communications Magazine, IEEE'', 48(11):156--163, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The complexity and randomness of certain types of wireless networks and signal propagation has motivated the use of [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks|stochastic geometry models]] in order to model the SINR, particularly for cellular or mobile phone networks.&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"&gt;M. Haenggi. ''Stochastic geometry for wireless networks''. Cambridge University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
SINR is commonly used in [[wireless communication]] as a way to measure the quality of wireless connections. Typically, the energy of a signal fades with distance, which is referred to as a [[path loss]] in wireless networks. Conversely, in wired networks the existence of a wired path between the sender or transmitter and the receiver determines the correct reception of data. In a wireless network ones has to take other factors into account (e.g. the background noise, interfering strength of other simultaneous transmission). The concept of SINR attempts to create a representation of this aspect.

==Mathematical definition==
The definition of SINR is usually defined for a particular receiver (or user). In particular, for a receiver located at some point ''x'' in space (usually, on the plane), then its corresponding SINR given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x) {{=}} \frac{P}{I+N} &lt;/math&gt;

where ''P'' is the power of the incoming signal of interest, ''I'' is the interference power of the other (interfering) signals in the network, and ''N'' is some noise term, which may be a constant or random. Like other ratios in electronic engineering and related fields, the SINR is often expressed in [[decibel]]s or dB.

==Propagation model==
To develop a mathematical model for estimating the SINR, a suitable [[mathematical model]] is needed to represent the propagation of the incoming signal and the interfering signals. A common model approach is to assume the [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks#Model fundamentals#Propagation model|propagation model]] consists of a random component and non-random (or deterministic) component.&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Blaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume I --- Theory'', volume 3, No 3--4 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BB2"&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Blaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume II --- Applications'', volume 4, No 1--2 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The deterministic component seeks to capture how a signal decays or attenuates as it travels a medium such as air, which is done by introducing a path-loss or attenuation function. A common choice for the path-loss function is a simple power-law. For example, if a signal travels from point ''x'' to point ''y'',  then it decays by a factor given by the path-loss function

:&lt;math&gt;  \ell(|x-y|)=  |x-y|^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;,

where the path-loss exponent '' α&gt;2'', and ''|x-y|'' denotes the [[Euclidean distance|distance]] between point ''y'' of the user and the signal source at point ''x''. Although this model suffers from a singularity (when ''x=y''), its simple nature results in it often being used due to the relatively tractable models it gives.&lt;ref name="andrews2010primer"/&gt; Exponential functions are sometimes used to model fast decaying signals.&lt;ref name="Haenggi2009"&gt;M. Haenggi, J. Andrews, F. Baccelli, O. Dousse, and M. Franceschetti. Stochastic geometry and random graphs for the analysis and design of wireless networks. ''IEEE JSAC'', 27(7):1029--1046, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The random component of the model entails representing [[multipath fading]] of the signal, which is caused by  signals colliding with and reflecting off various obstacles such as buildings. This is incorporated into the model by introducing a [[random variable]] with some [[probability distribution]]. The probability distribution is chosen depending on the type of fading model and include [[Rayleigh distribution|Rayleigh]], [[Rician distribution|Rician]], [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal shadow]] (or shadowing), and [[Nakagami distribution|Nakagami]].

==SINR model==
The propagation model leads to a model for the SINR.&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt; Consider a collection of 'n' base stations located at points ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the plane or 3D space. Then for a user located at, say ''x=0'', then the SINR for a signal coming from base station, say, ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', is given by



:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x_i) {{=}} \frac{\frac{F_i}{\ell(|x_i|)}}{\sum_{j\neq i} [\frac{F_j}{\ell(|x_j|)}] +N} &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are fading [[random variables]] of some distribution. Under the simple power-law path-loss model becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SINR}(x_i) {{=}} \frac{\frac{F_i}{|x_i|^{\alpha}}}{\sum_{j\neq i} \frac{F_j}{|x_j|^{\alpha}} +N} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Stochastic geometry models==
In wireless networks, the factors that contribute to the SINR are often random (or appear random) including the signal propagation and the positioning of network transmitters and receivers. Consequently, in recent years this has motivated research in developing tractable [[Stochastic geometry models of wireless networks|stochastic geometry models]] in order to estimate the SINR in wireless networks. The related field of [[continuum percolation theory]] has also been used to derive  bounds on the SINR in wireless networks.&lt;ref name="franceschetti2007random"&gt;M. Franceschetti and R. Meester. ''Random networks for communication: from statistical physics to information systems'', volume 24. Cambridge University Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meester1996continuum"&gt;R. Meester. ''Continuum percolation'', volume 119.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6815">In [[psychology]], the '''Simon effect''' is the finding that [[reaction time]]s are usually faster, and reactions are usually more accurate, when the [[stimulation|stimulus]] occurs in the same relative location as the [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]], even if the stimulus location is irrelevant to the task. It is named for [[J. R. Simon]] who first published the effect in the late 1960s. Simon's original explanation for the effect was that there is ''an innate tendency to respond toward the source of stimulation''.

According to the simple models of [[information processing]] that existed at the time, there are three stages of processing: stimulus identification, response selection, and response execution or the motor stage. The Simon Effect is generally thought to involve interference which occurs in the response-selection stage. This is similar to, yet distinct from, the interference that produces the better-known [[Stroop effect]].

== Original experiment ==
In Simon's original study, two lights (the stimulus) were placed on a rotating circular panel. This device would be rotated at varying degrees (away from the horizontal plane). Simon wished to see if an alteration of the spatial relationship, relative to the response keys, affected performance. Age was also a probable factor in reaction time. As predicted the reaction time of the groups increased based on the relative position of the light stimulus (age was not a factor). The reaction time increased by as much as 30%. (Simon &amp; Wolf, 1963).

However, what is usually seen as the first genuine demonstration of the effect that became known as the Simon effect is by Simon &amp; Rudell (1967). Here, they had participants respond to the words "left" and "right" that were randomly presented to the left or right ear. Although the auditory location was completely irrelevant to the task, participants showed marked increases in reaction latency if the location of the stimulus was not the same as the required response (if, for example, they were to react left to a word that was presented in the right ear).

== Method ==

A typical demonstration of the Simon effect involves placing a participant in front of a [[computer monitor]] and a panel with two buttons on it, which he or she may press. The participant is told that they should press the button on the right when they see something red appear on the screen, and the button on the left when they see something green. Participants are usually told to ignore the location of the stimulus and base their response on the task-relevant color.

Participants typically react faster to red lights that appear on the right hand side of the screen by pressing the button on the right of their panel (congruent trials). Reaction times are typically slower when the red stimulus appears on the left hand side of the screen and the participant must push the button on the right of their panel (incongruent trials). The same, but vice versa, is true for the green stimuli.

This happens despite the fact that the position of the stimulus on the screen relative to the physical position of the buttons on the panel is irrelevant to the task and not correlated with which response is correct. The task, after all, requires the subject to note only the colour of the object (i.e., red or green) by pushing the corresponding button, and not its position on the screen.

== Explanation ==

According to Simon himself (1969), the location of the stimulus, although irrelevant to the task, directly influences response-selection due to an automatic tendency to 'react towards the source of the stimulation'. Although other accounts have been suggested (cf. Hommel, 1993), explanations for the Simon effect generally refer back to the interference that occurs in the response-selection stage of decision making. Neurologically there could be involvement of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as the [[Anterior cingulate cortex]], which is thought to be responsible for conflict monitoring. The Simon Effect shows that location information cannot be ignored and will affect decision making, even if the participant knows that the information is irrelevant.

Logical argument for response selection:

The challenge in the Simon effect is said to occur during the response selection stage of judgment. This is due to two factors which eliminate the stimulus identification stage and the execution state. In the stimulus identification stage the participant only needs to be cognitively aware that a stimulus is present. An error would not occur at this stage unless he or she were [[visually impaired]] or had some sort of stimulus deficit. As well, an error or delay cannot occur during the execution state because an action has already been decided upon in the previous stage (the response selection stage) and no further decision making takes place (i.e. you cannot make a change to your response without going back to the second stage).

== Practical implications ==

A knowledge of the Simon effect is useful in the design of man-machine interfaces. [[Aircraft]] cockpits, for example, require a person to react quickly to a situation. If a pilot is flying a plane and there is a problem with the left engine, an aircraft with a good man-machine interface design (which most have) would position the indicator light for the left engine to the left of the indicator light for the right engine. This interface would display information in a way that matches the types of responses that people should make. If it were the other way around, the pilot might be more likely to respond incorrectly and adjust the wrong engine.

In Buddhist philosophy, '''Svasaṃvedana''' (also ''Svasaṃvitti'') is a term which refers to the self-reflexive nature of [[consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams. ''The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence'', pg. xi. Curzon press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially a theory of [[cognition]] held by the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghika]] and [[Sautrāntika|Sautrantika]] schools while the [[Sarvastivada]]-[[Vaibhāṣika|Vaibhasika]] school argued against it.

The idea was famously defended by the Indian philosopher [[Dignaga]], and is an important doctrinal term in Indian [[Mahayana]] thought and [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. It is also often translated as self cognition or self [[apperception]]. 

== Sources in the Buddhist schools ==
According to Zhihua Yao, the theory was first presented by the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghika]] school. Their view was preserved in the [[Sarvastivada]] compendium of [[Abhidharma]] called [[Mahavibhasa|Maha-Vibhasa]] and states:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is the nature (''[[svabhava]]'') of awareness (''[[Jnana|jñana]]'') and so forth to apprehend, thus awareness can apprehend itself as well as others. This is like a lamp that can illuminate itself and others owing to its nature of luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The issue is also discussed in the Theravadin [[Kathavatthu|Katthavatthu]] (section V.9) in a dialogue between a Theravadin and an Andhaka (the Mahasamghikas in the [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]] region).&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the dialogue, the Andhaka is asked by the Theravadin if one knows an awareness of the present ''by that same awareness.'' The Andhaka first denies this, but then affirms it when asked again. In the commentary to the Katthavatthu, [[Buddhaghoṣa|Buddhaghosa]] explains this because "continuity is concerned", thus if seen by itself a mind moment cannot know itself but in a continuous stream of mind moments it can thus be said.&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The Theravadin counters with the argument that the other aggregates like feeling do not feel themselves and uses similes like a knife that cannot cut itself or a needle that does not pierce itself. The Andhaka then recovers by making the following argument for his position of self cognition:&lt;blockquote&gt;But, when all phenomena are seen as impermanent, is not that awareness also seen as impermanent?&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Sarvastivada sources which discuss self-cognition mainly do so in order to refute the idea that a mind moment can know itself in that moment. These include the [[Jnanaprasthana|Jñanaprasthana]] and [[Mahavibhasa]]. &lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; However that does not mean the Sarvastivadins reject all theories of self cognition, they developed their own theory which argued that mind moments know themselves only reflexively in regards to the previous mind moments. As Zhihua Yao states, "in other words, the mind knows itself through a ''reflection'' of the past mind".&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The Sarvastivadins use their metaphysical theory of the real existence of the past, present and future to allow for a present mind to take a past mind as itself.

Sautrantika authors also discussed the theory. It was extensively covered by the Harivarman, the author of the [[Tattvasiddhi|Tattvasiddhishastra]], and shows that he was in a dialogue with both Sarvastivada and Mahasamghika views.&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Harivarman's view argues against the Mahasamghika's simultaenous model of self-cognition and instead argues that self-cognition is only seen in the course of successive moments of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; That is, it involves multiple mental processes which Harivarman considers as happening in the "present continuum" and is not a case of a single mind moment knowing itself but is a case of the mind grasping the "image" (''akara'') of itself as it is fading away. &lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; This is also part of his account of how memory works.

The Buddhist philosopher [[Dignāga|Dignaga]] also defended a theory of ''svasamvedana'' drawing on Sautrantika and Yogacara influences. For Dignaga, ''svasamvedana'' is a kind of perception (''pratyaksa'') which is an "internal awareness of mental consciousness" and his theory of perception also entails that it is non-conceptual (unlike the other source of valid cognition, ''anumana -'' inference).&lt;ref&gt;Zhihua Yao, The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition (Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism) 1st Edition, 2005, p. 131, 138&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Mahayana scholasticism==
Svasaṃvedana is at the root of a major doctrinal disagreement in Indian Mahayana Buddhism. While defended by the [[Yogacara]] thinkers such as [[Dharmakirti]] and the eclectic [[Santaraksita]], it was attacked by '[[Prasangika]] [[Madhyamika]]' thinkers such as [[Candrakirti]] and [[Santideva]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams. ''The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence'', pg. xiii. Curzon press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Since in [[Mādhyamika]] thought all [[dharmas]] are [[Shunyata|empty]] of inherent essence ([[Svabhava]]), they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self validating and therefore not characterized by [[emptiness]].

In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] there are various competing views regarding svasaṃvedana (Tibetan: Ranggi rig pa). 

In the [[Nyingma]] school's [[Dzogchen]] tradition, svasaṃvedana is often called 'the very nature of mind' (sems kyi chos nyid) and metaphorically referred to as '[[Luminous mind|luminosity]]' (''gsal ba'') or 'clear light' (''[[Ösel (yoga)|'od gsal]]''). A common Tibetan metaphor for this reflexivity is that of a lamp in a dark room which in the act of illuminating objects in the room also illuminates itself. [[Dzogchen]] meditative practices aim to bring the mind to direct realization of this luminous nature. In [[Dzogchen]] (as well as some [[Mahamudra]] traditions) Svasaṃvedana is seen as the primordial substratum or ground (gdod ma'i gzhi) of mind. 

Following [[Je Tsongkhapa]]'s (1357–1419) interpretation of the [[Prasaṅgika]] [[Madhyamaka]] view, the [[Gelug]] school completely denies both the conventional and the ultimate existence of reflexive awareness. This is one of Tsongkhapa's "eight difficult points" that distinguish the [[Prasaṅgika]] view from others.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams. ''The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence'', pg. xv. Curzon press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nyingma]] philosopher [[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso]] (1846–1912) defended the conventional existence of reflexive awareness as per the [[Madhyamaka]] [[two truths doctrine]]. According to Mipham, the Prasangika critique of reflexive awareness only applied to its ultimate inherent reality and not its conventional status.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Williams. ''The Reflexive Nature of Awareness: A Tibetan Madhyamaka Defence'', pg. xvi. Curzon press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''taijitu''' ({{lang-zh|t=太極圖|s=太极图|p=tàijítú|w=t'ai⁴chi²t'u²}})  is a [[Character (symbol)|symbol or diagram]] ({{lang|zh|图}} ''tú'') in [[Chinese philosophy]] representing [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] ({{lang|zh|太极}} ''tàijí'' "great pole" or "supreme ultimate") representing both its monist (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]'') and its dualist ([[yin and yang]]) aspects. Such a diagram was first introduced by  [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|philosopher]] [[Zhou Dunyi]] (周敦頤 1017–1073) in his ''Taijitu shuo'' 太極圖說.

The modern [[Taoism|Taoist]] canon, compiled during the [[Ming China|Ming era]], has at least half a dozen variants of such ''taijitu''. The two most similar are the "Taiji [[Xiantiandao|Primal Heaven]]" (太極先天圖 ''tàijí  xiāntiān tú'') and the "[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]" (無極圖 ''wújí tú'') diagrams, both of which have been extensively studied during the Qing period for their possible connection with Zhou Dunyi's ''taijitu''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Adler, ''Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi'',  SUNY Press, 2014,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=09ouAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ming period author [[Lai Zhide]] (1525–1604) simplified the ''taijitu'' to a design of two interlocking spirals. In the Ming era, the combination of the two interlocking spirals of the ''taijitu'' with two black-and-white dots superimposed on them became identified with the ''[[Yellow River Map|He tu]]'' or "Yellow River diagram" (河圖). This version was reported in Western literature of the late 19th century as the "Great Monad",&lt;ref&gt;Labelled "The Great Monad" by [[Hampden Coit DuBose]], ''The Dragon, Image, and Demon: Or, The Three Religions of China; Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism'' (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/dragonimageandd00bosegoog#page/n359/mode/2up p. 357]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been widely popularised in Western popular culture as the "yin-yang symbol" since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"The 'River Diagram' is the pattern of black-and-white dots which appears superimposed on the interlocking spirals [...] Those spirals alone form the ''Taiji tu'' or 'Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate', often known in English since the 1960s as the 'yin-yang symbol'.) These dots were believed to be collated with the eight trigrams, and hence with the concepts of roundness and of the heavens, while the equally numinous 'Luo River Writing' was a pattern of dots accosiated with the number nine, with squareness and with the earth."
Craig Clunas, ''Pictures and Visuality in Early Modern China'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q06pemllwx0C&amp;pg=PA107  p. 107].
&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Chinese term for the modern symbol is {{lang|zh|太极兩儀图}} "two-part Taiji diagram".

[[Unicode]] features the "yin-yang symbol" in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block, at code point U+262F  (YIN YANG ☯). The related "double body symbol" is included at U+0FCA  (TIBETAN SYMBOL NOR BU NYIS -KHYIL ࿊), in the [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] block.
The [[Soyombo symbol]], that includes a taijitu, is available in Unicode as U+11A9E, 𑪞, U+11A9F, 𑪟, and U+11AA0, 𑪠.

Ornamental patterns with visual similarity to the "yin-yang symbol" are found in archaeological artefacts of [[European prehistory]]; such designs are sometimes descriptively dubbed "yin yang symbols" in archaeological literature by modern scholars.&lt;ref name="Celtic yin yang"&gt;{{harvnb|Peyre|1982|pp=62–64, 82 (pl.

== Structure ==
[[File:ZhoushiTaijitu.png|thumb|right|Ming-era Daoist ''Taijitu'']]
The ''taijitu'' consists of five parts. Strictly speaking, the "yin and yang symbol", itself popularly called ''taijitu'', represents the second of these five parts of the diagram.

*At the top, an empty circle depicts the absolute (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]]'')
*A second circle represents the Taiji as harboring Dualism, [[yin and yang]], represented by filling the circle in a black-and-white pattern. In some diagrams, there is a smaller empty circle at the center of this, representing Emptiness as the foundation of duality.
*Below this second circle is a five-part diagram representing the Five Agents (''[[Wu Xing|Wuxing]]''), representing a further stage in the differentiation of Unity into Multiplicity. The Five Agents are connected by lines indicating their proper sequence,  Wood (木) → Fire (火) → Earth (土) → Metal (金) → Water (水).
*The circle below the Five Agents represents the conjunction of Heaven and Earth, which in turn gives rise to the "ten thousand things". This stage is also represented by the Eight Trigrams (''[[Bagua]]'').
*The final circle represents the state of multiplicity, glossed  "The ten thousand things are born by transformation" (萬物化生; modern 化生万物)

== History ==
{{See also|Taiji (philosophy)|Yin and yang}}
The term ''taijitu'' in modern Chinese is commonly used to mean the simple "divided circle" form ([[File:Taijitu - Small (CW).svg|18px]]), but it may refer to any of several schematic diagrams that contain at least one circle with an inner pattern of [[symmetry]] representing [[yin and yang]].

=== Song era ===
While the concept of [[yin and yang]] dates to Chinese antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;in the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000–750 BC),  yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (⚋) and yang is solid (⚊).&lt;/ref&gt;
the interest in "diagrams" (圖 ''tú'') is an intellectual fashion of [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the [[Song China|Song period]] (11th century), and it declined again
in the Ming period, by the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Adler152"&gt;Joseph A. Adler, ''Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi'',  SUNY Press, 2014,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=09ouAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original description of a ''taijitu'' is due to Song era philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073), author of the ''Taijitu shuo'' {{lang|zh|太極圖說}} "Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate", which became the cornerstone of [[Neo-Confucianist]] cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of [[Chinese Buddhism]] and Taoism with [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] discussions in the ''[[Yijing]]''.

Zhou's key terms [[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]] and [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] appear in the opening line {{lang|zh|無極而太極}}, which Adler notes could also be translated "The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Non-polar (''wuji'') and yet Supreme Polarity (''taiji'')! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates ''yang''; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates ''yin''; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing ''yin'' and ''yang'', the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of ''yang'' and ''yin'' generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] ''qi'' harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply ''yin'' and ''yang''; ''yin'' and ''yang'' are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Joseph A. (1999). [http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Chou.htm "Zhou Dunyi: The Metaphysics and Practice of Sagehood"], in ''Sources of Chinese Tradition'', William Theodore De Bary and Irene Bloom, eds. 2nd ed., 2 vols. Columbia University Press. pp. 673–674.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Instead of usual ''Taiji'' translations "Supreme Ultimate" or "Supreme Pole", Adler uses "Supreme Polarity" (see Robinet 1990) because [[Zhu Xi]] describes it as the alternating principle of [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']], and ...
&lt;blockquote&gt;insists that ''taiji'' is not a thing (hence "Supreme Pole" will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, ''taiji'' is the ''yin-yang'' principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic "first principle." ''Wuji'' as "non-polar" follows from this. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the 12th century, there has been a vigorous discussion in Chinese philosophy regarding the ultimate origin of Zhou Dunyi's diagram.
[[Zhu Xi]] (12th century) insists that Zhou Dunyi had composed the diagram himself, against the prevailing view that he had received it from Daoist sources.
Zhu Xi could not accept a Daoist origin of the design, because it would have undermined the claim of uniqueness attached to the Neo-Confucian concept of ''dao''.&lt;ref name="Adler152"/&gt;

While [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073) popularized the circular diagram,&lt;ref name="Yao2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xinzhong Yao|title=An introduction to Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAE2OJ9bPG0C&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=13 February 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64430-3|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of "swirling" patterns first appears in the Ming period.

Zhao Huiqian (趙撝謙, 1351–1395) was the first to introduce the "swirling" variant of the ''taijitu'' in his ''Liushu benyi'' (六書本義, 1370s).
The diagram is combined with the eight trigrams (''[[bagua]]'') and called the "River Chart spontaneously generated by Heaven and Earth".
By the end of the Ming period, this diagram had become a widespread representation of [[Chinese cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;François Louis,
'The Genesis of an Icon: The "Taiji" Diagram's Early History', ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 63.11 (June 2003),  145–196.&lt;/ref&gt;
The dots were introduced in the later Ming period (replacing the droplet-shapes used earlier, in the 16th century) and are encountered more frequently in the [[Qing dynasty|Qing period]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis (2003) has diagrams with dots dated to 1623 (p. 187) and 1688 (p. 146, p. 190).&lt;/ref&gt; The dots represent the seed of yin within yang and the seed of yang within yin; the idea that neither can exist without the other. 

Lai Zhide's design is similar to the ''[[Gankyil|gakyil]]'' (''dga' 'khyil'' or "wheel of joy") symbols of [[Tibetan Buddhism]];
but while the Tibetan designs have three or four swirls (representing the [[Three Jewels]] or the [[Four Noble Truths]], i.e. as a [[triskele]] and a [[tetraskelion]] design), Lai Zhide's taijitu has two swirls, terminating in a central circle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beer, ''The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols'', 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 209]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern yin-yang symbol ==
The Ming-era design of the taijitu of two interlocking spirals has been reported as "yin-yang symbol" in the first half of the 20th century.
The [[flag of South Korea]], originally introduced as the flag of [[Joseon]] era Korea in 1882, shows this symbol in red and blue. This was a modernisation of the older (early 19th century) form of the [[Bat Quai Do]] used as the Joseon royal standard.

Since the 1960s, "yin-yang symbol" is most widely applied to the ''He tu'' symbol which combines the two interlocking spirals with two dots.
In the standard form of the contemporary "yin-yang symbol", one draws on the [[diameter]] of a [[circle]] two non-overlapping circles each of which has a diameter equal to the [[radius]] of the outer circle. One keeps the line that forms an "S", and one erases or obscures the other line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peyre|1982|pp=62f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is also described{{according to whom|date=December 2015}}{{year needed|date=December 2015}} "pair of fishes nestling head to tail against each other".&lt;ref name="Robinet 2008, 934"&gt;{{harvnb|Robinet|2008|p=934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soyombo symbol]] of Mongolia may be prior to 1686.
It combines several abstract shapes, including a ''Taiji'' symbol illustrating the mutual complement of man and woman. In socialist times, it was alternatively interpreted as two fish symbolizing vigilance, because fish never close their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pu̇revsambuu |first1=G. |title=Mongolia |location=Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia |publisher=[[Montsame]] |year=2006 |isbn=99929-0-627-8 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern  symbol has  also been widely used in martial arts, particularly [[t'ai chi ch'uan]] (Taijiquan),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In this context, it is generally used to represent the interplay between [[Hard and soft (martial arts)|hard and soft techniques]].

The dots in the modern "yin-yang symbol" have been given the additional interpretation of "intense interaction" between the complementary principles.
&lt;ref&gt;"the yin/yang symbol so familiar to us contains a white dot amid the black and a black dot amid the white to indicate that these principles interact intensely." Norman R. Kraft, ''Ogdoadic Magick'', Weiser Books, 1969, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, being carried to the place of torture. Thirdly, by stripping and binding. Fourthly, the being hoisted up on the rack. Fifthly, squassation."

[[Image:Blighty.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A shell case embossed with an image of two wounded Tommies approaching the White Cliffs of Dover]]

'''Trench art''' is any decorative item made by soldiers, prisoners of war, or civilians where the manufacture is directly linked to armed conflict or its consequences. It offers an insight not only to their feelings and emotions about the war, but also their surroundings and the materials they had available to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armymuseum.co.nz/whats-on/world-war-one-centenary/personal-treasures-wwi-trench-art/|title=Personal Treasures: WWI Trench Art|website=New Zealand Army Museum|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not limited to the World Wars, the history of trench art spans conflicts from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] to the present day. Although the practice flourished during World War I, the term 'trench art' is also used to describe souvenirs manufactured by service personnel during World War II. Some items manufactured by soldiers, prisoners of war or civilians during earlier conflicts have been retrospectively described as trench art.

== Categorisation ==
There are four broad categories of trench art:

===Items made by soldiers===
{{multiple image
 | footer = Two [[chestnut]] leaves, engraved by a French soldier with the names of his children "Andrée" and "Eléonore" while waiting in the trenches.
 | image1 = "Andrée".jpg
 | image2 = "Eléonore".jpg
 }}
There is much evidence to prove that some trench art was made in the trenches, by soldiers, during war.

In ''With a Machine Gun to Cambrai'', [[George Coppard]] tells of pressing his uniform buttons into the clay floor of his trench, then pouring molten lead from shrapnel into the impressions to cast replicas of the regimental crest.{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Chalk carvings were also popular, with contemporary postcards showing carvings in the rocky outcrops of [[Dugout (military)|dug-outs]].{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Many smaller items such as rings and knives were made by soldiers either in front line or support trenches, especially in quieter parts of the line.{{CN|date=April 2017}}

Wounded soldiers were encouraged to work at crafts as part of their recuperation, with embroidery and simple forms of woodwork being common. Again from ''With a Machine Gun to Cambrai'', George Coppard recalls that, while recuperating from wounds at a private house in [[Birkenhead]], "one kind old lady brought a supply of coloured silks and canvas and instructed us in the art of [[embroidery]]. A sampler which I produced under her guidance so pleased her that she had it framed for me."

An example of therapeutic embroidery during World War I is the work of British military in Egypt, who were photographed sewing and embroidering for Syrian refugees. There was also the Bradford Khaki Handicrafts Club, which was funded in Bradford, UK, in 1918, to provide occupational therapy and employment for men returning from the trenches in France|url=https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/organisations-and-movements/charities/bradford-khaki-handicrafts-club.

===Items made by POWs and internees===
The second category consists of items made by prisoners of war and interned civilians.

[[Prisoners of war|POWs]] had good reasons to make decorative objects: free time and limited resources. Much POW work was therefore done with the express intention of trading the finished article for food, money or other privileges.

Reference to POW work is made in the recollections of A B Baker, W.A.A.C., contained in the book ''Everyman at War'', published by Purdom in 1930:
"Part of my work had to do with prisoners quartered in a camp near to our own. Those Germans were friendly men. They were clever with their hands, and would give me little carvings which they had made."

===Items made by civilians===
[[File:Trench Art.JPG|left|thumb|Chromed metal trench art ashtray made from a 25 pounder shell casing, 1942]]
The third category is items made by civilians, which mainly means civilians in and around the conflict zone, but would also include items made by sweethearts at home.

In 1914, the US set up the [[Commission for Relief in Belgium]], headed by [[Herbert Hoover]]. It shipped staple foodstuffs, mainly flour, in the printed cotton flour sacks typical of the period. As thanks, the Belgians would embroider and paint in the designs, elaborating them with dates and flags and send them back to the US. Examples of these are now in the [[Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum|Herbert Hoover Museum]], but some were sold to soldiers in Paris or given as gifts.

Civilians in France, in the zones occupied by troops, were quick to exploit a new market. Embroidered [[postcard]]s were produced in what quickly became a [[cottage industry]], with civilians buying the surrounds and embroidering a panel of gauze. These postcards depicted regimental crests or patriotic flags and national symbols in abundance, and millions were produced over the course of the war.

At war's end, when civilians began to reclaim their shattered communities, a new market appeared in the form of pilgrims and tourists. Over the ensuing twenty years mountains of discarded debris, shell casings, and castoff equipment were slowly recycled, with mass-produced town crest motifs being stuck onto bullets, shell casings, fuse caps, and other [[wikt:paraphernalia|paraphernalia]] to be sold to tourists.

===Commercial items===
The fourth category is purely commercial production. After the war, [[tonne]]s of surplus materials were sold by the government and converted to souvenirs of the conflict.

Ship breaking, particularly if the ship had been involved in significant events such as the [[Battle of Jutland]], resulted in much of the wood from the ship being turned into miniature barrels, letter racks, and boxes, with small brass plaques attached announcing, for example, "Made of [[teak]] from HMS ''Shipsname'', which fought at the Battle of Jutland".

'''UpStage''' is an open source server-side application that has been purpose built for [[Cyberformance]]: multiple artists collaborate in real time via the UpStage platform to create and present live theatrical performances, for audiences who can be online (from anywhere in the world) or in a shared space, and who can interact with the performance via a text chat tool. It can also be understood as a form of [[digital puppetry]]. It is the first open source platform designed specifically for avatar performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nonverbal Communication in Virtual Worlds|last=Tanenbaum|first=Joshua|last2=El-Nasr|first2=Magy Seif|last3=Nixon|first3=Michael|publisher=ETC Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-304-81204-9|location=USA|pages=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and context==
[[File:Indigenous Maniacs.jpg|thumb|Screengrab from "Indigenous Maniacs", a performance created by UpStage workshop participants at the Computing Women's Congress, Waikato University (NZ), February 2006.]]UpStage was developed during 2003 by programmer [http://halo.gen.nz Douglas Bagnall], to realise the vision of [[cyberformance]] troupe Avatar Body ''Collision''; the group had been creating live performance on the internet using free chat applications such as iVisit and the Palace, and wanted to create an application that better met their artistic needs. The first version of the software was created with a grant from the Smash Palace Collaboration Fund, a joint initiative of [[Creative New Zealand]] and the [[Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (New Zealand)|NZ Ministry for Research, Science and Technology]]; it was launched on 9 January 2004 and began to be used by artists and students around the world, as well as by the originators, Avatar Body ''Collision''.

In 2006, the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the [[Auckland University of Technology]] began a relationship with the UpStage project, which has seen teams of final year software development students work on UpStage as a real-world software development project. This has provided invaluable ongoing maintenance and development for the software.

Also in 2006, UpStage received a second grant, this time from the Community Partnership Fund of the New Zealand government's Digital Strategy, which enabled the development of UpStage V2. Douglas Bagnall was once again the lead developer, working this time in conjunction with the AUT students. UpStage V2 was launched in June 2007, with a two-week exhibition at the [[New Zealand Film Archive]] and the first UpStage festival, 070707. The festival featured 13 performances by artists from around the world and took place over a 12-hour period on 7 July 2007. 

A second festival was held on 080808 (8–9 August 2008), this time covering an 18-hour period and involving artists from at least 14 time zones. It was reviewed in the Australian Stage Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2008-11-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, festivals were held annually on the successive monthly dates until 121212 (12 December 2012) when the festival extended over a period of one week and included cyberformance in UpStage and other online platforms. A number of works from previous festivals were restaged as a retrospective programme within the festival.

Although "131313" was not possible, the tenth birthday of UpStage was celebrated 13 months after 121212, with a mini-festival of three performances and a meeting to discuss the future of UpStage. At this point, UpStage was unfunded and sustained by volunteers and the (also voluntary) work of the AUT student team. The meeting took place physically in Wellington, New Zealand, and online participants joined via UpStage. Everyone agreed that the project should continue - somehow - and also agreed that the software itself needs to be completely redeveloped, in order to take advantage of newer technologies and be more easily developed and maintained by globally dispersed open source developers.

==Features of UpStage==
[[File:Eindhoven02.png|thumb|Screengrab from the cyberformance "We have a situation - Peopoly", performed online in UpStage and at De Bibliotheek Eindhoven on 18 April 2013.]]As a web-based [[server-side]] application, UpStage can be accessed by both performers and audiences from almost any internet connected computer, using any operating system and browser; computers behind [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] may require specific ports to be open, and the browser must have the [[Flash player]] plug-in as this is used to serve the media to the browser.

"Players" (performers) log into UpStage and have access to a "workshop" or backstage area where they can upload media (graphics and audio), create "stages", and assign media to stages. Once on the stage, a logged-in player has access to numerous tools which allow them to manipulate the media - place, move and speak aloud with graphical avatars (using [[Text2Speech|text2speech]]), change backdrops, play audio files, draw directly on the stage in real time, add live web cam feeds, use text chat and perform other tasks in order to create and present a performance.

Audience members (also known as "chatters") do not log in - they simply follow a link from an email or another web page, and arrive at the stage which loads as a web page in their browser. They do not see any of the player tools, but they see and hear everything that the players are creating on the stage, and they can chat in the text chat along with the players. Audience chat appears grey and silent, while player chat is black and spoken aloud.

Newcomers (both players and audience) to UpStage can learn the basics very quickly, and the fact that no additional software download is required (unless the Flash player plug-in is not already installed) makes it very accessible. The chat interface encourages playful banter and audience members contribute to and embellish the performance via the chat.

The media used in UpStage performances is created outside of UpStage, using graphic or audio software. Once optimised for Upstage, it is then uploaded via the web interface known as the Workshop and becomes available to everyone who has a log in for that particular UpStage server.

UpStage is an [[open source]] project; it can be downloaded from the [[GitHub]] site and installed on a web server, giving control over who has log-in access. The interface can also be customised.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2915">'''Violent disorder''' is a [[statutory]] offence in [[England and Wales]]. It is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/section/2 section 2(1)] of the [[Public Order Act 1986]]. Sections 2(1) to (4) of that Act provide:

:(1) Where 3 or more persons who are present together use or threaten unlawful violence and the conduct of them (taken together) is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for their personal safety, each of the persons using or threatening unlawful violence is guilty of violent disorder.
:(2) It is immaterial whether the 3 or more use or threaten unlawful violence simultaneously.
:(3) No person of reasonable firmness need actually be, or be likely to be, present at the scene.
:(4) Violent disorder may be committed in private as well as in public places.

'''"3 or more persons"'''

See the following cases:
*R v Mahroof, 88 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 317, CA
*R v Fleming and Robinson [1989] [[Criminal Law Review|Crim LR]] 658, CA
*R v McGuigan and Cameron [1991] Crim LR 719, CA

'''"Violence"'''

This word is defined by section 8.

==Mens rea==
For the [[mens rea]], see section 6(2).

==Indictment==
As to particularisation, see R v Mahroof, 88 Cr App R 317, CA.

==Alternative verdict==
See sections 7(3) and (4).

==Arrest==
Before 1 January 2006 this offence was classified as an [[arrestable offence]] by virtue of section 24(1)(b) of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. See now sections 24 and 24A of that Act, as substituted by the [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]].

==Mode of trial and sentence==
Violent disorder is triable [[either way]]. A person guilty of violent disorder is liable on [[conviction]] on [[indictment]] to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or to both, or, on [[summary conviction]], to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the [[statutory maximum]], or to both.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Public Order Act 1986]], section 2(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

The following cases are relevant:

*R v Tomlinson, 157 JP 695, CA
*R v Hebron and Spencer, 11 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr App R (S)]] 226, [1989] Crim LR 839, CA
*R v Watson &amp; others (1990) 12 Cr App R (S) 477
*R v Tyler and others, 96 Cr App R 332, [1993] Crim LR 60, CA

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14412">[[Oliver E. Williamson]] hypothesised (1964) that [[profit maximization]] would not be the objective of the managers of a joint stock organisation.&lt;ref name="International Management Journal"&gt;[http://www.managementjournals.com/journals/ig/vol1/21-1-1-2.pdf International Management Journal], Kenny Crossan, The Theory of the Firm and Alternative Theories of Firm Behaviour:  A Critique.  International Journal of Applied Institutional Governance Volume 1 Issue 1; {{ISSN|1747-6259}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory, like other managerial theories of the firm, assumes that utility maximisation is a manager’s sole objective.&lt;ref name="Principles of Microeconomics"&gt;D. D. Tewari, Katar Singh (2003). Principles of Microeconomics. New Age International Publishers. pp. 92.  {{ISBN|81-224-1017-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
However it is only in a corporate form of business organisation that a self-interest seeking manager maximise his/her own utility, since there exists a separation of ownership and control.&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory"&gt;H.L. Ahuja (2009). Advanced Economic Theory. S.Chand&amp;Co. pp. 932. {{ISBN|81-219-0260-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The managers can use their ‘discretion’ to frame and execute policies which would maximise their own utilities rather than maximising the shareholders’ utilities. This is essentially the [[principal–agent problem]].&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics by Piyali"&gt;Geetika, Piyali Ghosh, Purba Roy Choudhury (2009). Managerial Economics. The McGraw-Hill Companies. pp. 50. {{ISBN|978-0-07-026365-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This could however threaten their job security, if a minimum level of profit is not attained by the firm to distribute among the shareholders.&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics M.M."&gt;Mukund Mahajan (2008). Managerial Economics, third edition. Nirali Prakashan. pp. 10.15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic assumptions of the model are:
# Imperfect competition in the markets.
# Divorce of ownership and management.
# A minimum profit constraint exists for the firms to be able to pay dividends to their share holders.&lt;ref name="srv.manipalu"&gt;[http://train-srv.manipalu.com/wpress/?p=95249 Objectives of Firms], SMU WordPress. MB0042-Unit-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Managerial utility function==
The managerial [[utility function]] includes variables such as [[salary]], [[job security]], power, status, dominance, prestige and professional excellence of managers. Of these, salary is the only quantitative variable and thus [[measurable]]. The other variables are non-pecuniary, which are non-quantifiable.
The variables expenditure on staff salary, management slack, discretionary investments can be assigned nominal values. Thus these will be used as proxy variables to measure the real or unquantifiable concepts like job security, power, status, dominance, prestige and professional excellence of managers, appearing in the managerial [[utility function]].&lt;ref name="Managerial Eco by Nadar"&gt;E. Narayanan Nadar, S. Vijayan (2009). Managerial Economics, eastern economy edition. PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd. pp. 42. {{ISBN|978-81-203-3720-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Utility function''' or '''"expense preference"'''&lt;ref name="
Managerial Economics by Trivedi"&gt;M. L. Trivedi (2009). Managerial Economics: Theory and Applications. Tata McGraw–Hill. pp. 100. {{ISBN|978-0-07-043578-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of a manager can be given by:

::&lt;math&gt;U=U(S,M,I_D) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''U'' denotes the Utility function, ''S'' denotes the “monetary expenditure on the staff”, ''M'' stands for "Management Slack" and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; stands for amount of "Discretionary Investment".

"'''Monetary expenditure on staff'''" include not only the manager's salary and other forms of monetary compensation received by him from the business firm but also the number of staff under the control of the manager as there is a close [[positive relationship]] between the number of staff and the manager's salary.

"'''Management slack'''" consists of those non-essential management perquisites such as entertainment expenses, lavishly furnished offices, luxurious cars, large expense accounts, etc. which are above minimum to retain the managers in the firm. These perks, even if not provided would not make the manager quit his job, but these are incentives which enhance their prestige and status in the organisation in turn contributing to efficiency of the firm's operations.
The Management Slack is also a part of the cost of production of the [[firm]].

"'''Discretionary investment'''" refers to the amount of resources left at a manager's disposal, to be able to spend at his own discretion. For example, spending on latest equipment, furniture, decoration material, etc. It satisfies their ego and gives them a sense of pride. These give a boost to the manager's esteem and status in the organisation. Such investments are over and above the amount required for the survival of the firm (such as periodic replacement of the [[capital equipment]]).&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Managerial Eco by Nadar" /&gt;

==Concepts of profit in the model==
The various concepts of profit used in the model needs to be understood clearly before moving to the main model. Williamson has put forth four main concepts of profits in his model:

===Actual profit (Π)===
::&lt;math&gt;\Pi=R-C-S \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R'' is the total revenue, ''C'' is the cost of production and ''S'' is the staff expenditure.

===Reported profit (Π&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;)===
::&lt;math&gt;\Pi_r=\Pi - M \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Π is the actual profit and ''M'' is the management slack.

===Minimum profit (Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)===
It is the amount of profit after tax which should be paid to the [[shareholders]] of the firm, in the form of [[dividends]], to keep them satisfied. If the minimum level of [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] cannot be given out to the shareholders, they might resort of bulk sale of their shares which will transfer the ownership to other hands leaving the [[company]] in the risk of a complete take over.  Since the shareholders have the [[voting rights]], they might also vote for the change of the top level of management. Thus the [[job security]] of the manager is also threatened.&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics by Trivedi" /&gt;
Ideally the reported profits must be either equal to or greater than the minimum profits plus the [[taxes]], as it is only after paying out the minimum profit that the additional profit can be used to increase the managerial [[utility]] further.

::&lt;math&gt;\Pi_r \ge \Pi_0 +T \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Π&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the reported profit, Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the minimum profit and ''T'' is the tax.

===Discretionary profit (Π&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;)===
It is basically the entire amount of profit left after minimum profits and tax which is used to increase the manager’s utility, that is, to pay out managerial emoluments as well as allow them to make discretionary investments.

::&lt;math&gt;\Pi_D=\Pi - \Pi_0 - T \,&lt;/math&gt;
                          
where Π&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; is the discretionary profit, Π is the actual profit, Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the minimum profit and ''T'' is the tax amount.

However, what appears in the managerial utility function is discretionary investments (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;) and not discretionary profits. Thus it is very important to distinguish between the two as further in the model we would have to maximize the managerial utility function given the profit constraint.

::&lt;math&gt;I_D=\Pi_r - \Pi_0 - T \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Π&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the reported profit, '''Π&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the minimum profit and ''T'' is the tax amount.

Thus it can be seen that the difference in the Discretionary Profit and the Discretionary investment arises because of the amount of managerial slack. This can be represented by the given equation

::&lt;math&gt;\Pi_D=I_D +M \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Π&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; is the discretionary profit, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; is the Discretionary investment and ''M'' is the management slack.&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Business Economics by Maria"&gt;Maria Moschandreas (2005).

==Model framework==
For simple representation of the model the managerial slack is considered to be zero. Thus there is no difference between the actual profit and reported profit, which implies that the discretionary profit is equal to the discretionary investment.  I.e.

: &lt;math&gt;\Pi_r=\Pi \text{ or }\Pi_D=I_D \,&lt;/math&gt;

where Π&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is the reported profit, Π is the actual profit, Π&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;  is the discretionary profit and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; is the discretionary investment.

Such that the utility function of the manager becomes

::&lt;math&gt;U=U(S,I_D) \,&lt;/math&gt;
where '''S''' is the staff expenditure and '''I&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;''' is the discretionary investment.

There is a trade off between these two variables. Increase in either will give the manager a higher level of satisfaction. At any point of time the amount of both these variables combined is the same, therefore an increase in one would automatically require a decrease in the other. The manager therefore has to make a choice of the correct combination of these two variables to attain a certain level of desired utility.&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics by Piyali" /&gt;

Substituting

::&lt;math&gt;I_D=\Pi - \Pi_0 - T \,&lt;/math&gt;  in the new managerial utility function, it can be rewritten as

::&lt;math&gt;U=U(S, \Pi - \Pi_0 - T) \,&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship between the two variables in the manager’s utility function is determined by the profit function. Profit of a firm is dependent on the demand and cost conditions. Given the cost conditions the demand is dependent of the price, staff expenditures and the market condition.

::&lt;math&gt;X=f(S,\bar{P},\bar{E}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Price and market condition is assumed to be given exogenously at equilibrium. Thus the profit of the firm becomes dependent on the staff expenditure which can be written as

::&lt;math&gt;\Pi=f(X)=f(S,\bar{P},\bar{E}) \,&lt;/math&gt;

Discretionary profit can be rewritten as
 
::&lt;math&gt;\Pi_D=f(S,\bar{P},\bar{E}) - \Pi_0 - T) \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the model, the managers would try to maximise their utility given the profit constraint

:: &lt;math&gt;\max U=U(S, \Pi - \Pi_0 - T) \,&lt;/math&gt;
 
:: &lt;math&gt;\text{subject to} \Pi \ge \Pi_0 +T \,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics by Trivedi" /&gt;

==Graphical representation of the model==
[[File:Utility indifference curves of managers.jpg|thumb|'''Fig 1. Utility indifference curves of managers''']]

Fig 1. shows the various levels of utility (''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) derived by the manager by combining different amounts of discretionary profits and staff expenditure. Higher the indifference curve, higher is the level of utility derived by the manager. Hence the manager would try to be on the highest level of indifference curve possible given the constraints. Staff expenditure is plotted on the ''x''-axis and discretionary profits on the ''y''-axis.

The discretionary profit in this simplified model is equal to the discretionary investment. The indifference curves are downward sloping and convex to the origin. This shows diminishing marginal rate of substitution of staff expenditure for discretionary profits. The curves are [[asymptotic]] in nature which implies that at any point of time and under any given circumstance the manager will choose positive amounts of both discretionary profits and staff expenditure.&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics by Trivedi" /&gt;

[[File:Discretionary profit curve.jpg|left|thumb|'''Fig 2. Discretionary profit curve''']]

Assuming that the firm is producing an optimum level of output and the market environment is given, the discretionary profits curve is generated, shown in Fig 2. It gives the relationship between staff expenditure and discretionary profits.

It can be seen from the figure that profit will be positive in the region between the points B and C. Initially with increase in profits, the staff expenditure the discretionary profits also increase, but this is only till the point Π&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, that is, till S level of staff expenditure. Beyond this if staff expenditure is increased due to increase in output, then a fall in the discretionary profits is noticed. Staff expenditure of less than B and more than C is not feasible as it wouldn't satisfy the minimum profit constraint and would in turn threaten the [[job security]] of managers.&lt;ref name="Managerial Economics M.M." /&gt;

[[File:Equilibrium of firm in Williamson's Model.jpg|thumb|'''Fig 3. Equilibrium of a firm in Williamson's Model''']]

To find the equilibrium in the model, Fig 1. is superimposed on Fig 2. The equilibrium point is the point where the discretionary profit curve is tangent to the highest possible indifference curve of the manager, which is point E in Fig 3. Staying at the highest profit point would require the manager to be at a lower indifference curve ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  In this case the highest attainable level of utility is ''U''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. At equilibrium, the level of profits would be lower but staff expenditure S* is higher than the staff expenditure made at the maximum profit point. As indifference curve is downward sloping, the equilibrium point would always be on the right of the maximum profit point. Thus the model shows the higher preference of managers for staff expenditure as compared to the discretionary investments.&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory" /&gt;

==Criticism==
# The model fails to describe how businesses take their price and output decisions in a highly competitive set up.&lt;ref name="International Management Journal" /&gt;
# The relationship between better performance of managers and the increasing amounts spent on manager’s utility by the firm is not always true.&lt;ref name="srv.manipalu" /&gt;
# The model does not apply in a dynamic set up like changing demand and cost conditions during booms and recessions.&lt;ref name="Advanced Economic Theory" /&gt;
