'''7-Dehydrocholesterol''' ('''7-DHC''') is a [[zoosterol]] that functions in the [[blood plasma|serum]] as a [[cholesterol]] precursor, and is converted to [[Cholecalciferol|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the [[skin]], therefore functioning as [[provitamin]]-D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The presence of this compound in human skin enables humans to manufacture vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[cholecalciferol]]) from [[ultraviolet]] rays in the sun light, via an intermediate [[isomer]] pre-vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is also found in the [[milk]] of several mammalian species.&lt;ref&gt;"7-dehydrocholesterol." The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary. Houghton Mifflin Company, 2002. 21 Jan. 2007. [http://www.answers.com/topic/7-dehydrocholesterol Answers.com]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025151754/http://www.answers.com/topic/7-dehydrocholesterol |date=October 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In insects it is a precursor for the hormone [[ecdysone]], required for reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ed Yong]] (2012), Thanks to one gene, this fly needs a cactus to escape Neverland [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/09/28/fly-cactus-neverland-gene/ Not Exactly Rocket Science]&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered by Nobel-laureate organic chemist [[Adolf Windaus]].

==Location ==
The skin consists of two primary layers: an inner layer, the [[dermis]], comprising largely [[connective tissue]], and an outer, thinner [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. The thickness of the epidermis ranges from 0.08&amp;nbsp;mm to greater than 0.6&amp;nbsp;mm (from 0.003 to 0.024 inches).&lt;ref&gt;Frediric Martini et al. (2006). Human Anatomy. Pearson/Benjamin-Cummings Publishers, p. 89. {{ISBN|0-8053-7211-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The epidermis comprises five ''strata''; from outer to inner, they are the [[stratum corneum]], [[stratum lucidum]], [[stratum granulosum]], [[stratum spinosum]], and [[stratum basale]]. The highest concentrations of 7-dehydrocholesterol are found in the epidermal layer of skin—specifically in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum.&lt;ref name= Norman&gt;Norman, Anthony W. (1998) [http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/reprint/67/6/1108.pdf Sunlight, season, skin pigmentation, vitamin D, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D:integral components of the vitamin D endocrine system.] Am J Clin Nutr;67:1108–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The production of pre-vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is, therefore, greatest in these two layers.

==Radiation==
Synthesis of pre-vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in the skin involves [[UVB radiation]], which effectively penetrates only the epidermal layers of skin. 7-Dehydrocholesterol absorbs UV light most effectively at [[wavelength]]s between 290 and 320 [[nanometer|nm]] and, thus, the production of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; will occur primarily at those wavelengths. The two most important factors that govern the generation of pre-vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are the quantity (intensity) and quality (appropriate wavelength) of the UVB irradiation reaching the 7-dehydrocholesterol deep in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum.&lt;ref name= Norman/&gt; Another important consideration is the quantity of 7-dehydrocholesterol present in the skin. Under normal circumstances, ample quantities of 7-dehydrocholesterol (about 25&amp;ndash;50 [[microgram|ug]]/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of skin) are available in the stratum spinosum and stratum basale of human skin to meet the body's vitamin D requirements.

'''Abdul Aziz bin Ali al-Harbi''' is a [[Saudi Arabia]]n [[Islamic scholar]] and associate professor at [[Umm al-Qura University]] in [[Mecca]]. He is one of the founders and the current president of the Arabic Language Academy at Mecca.&lt;ref name="Harbi"&gt;[http://www.m-a-arabia.com/site/4473.html أ.د / عبد العزيز بن علي الحربي ]. Official website of the Academy, 9 February 2015. Accessed 8 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
A native of Mecca, Harbi [[Hafiz (Quran)|memorized]] the entirety of the [[Qur'an]], the Muslim holy book, at the age of eleven.&lt;ref name=cover&gt;Dr. Abdul Aziz al-Harbi, ''Tawjih mushkil al-qira`at al-'ashariya al-farashiya lughatan wa tasfiran wa i'raban'', back cover. 1st. ed. [[Riyadh]]: Dar Ibn Hazm, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbi earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[Exegesis]] of the [[Qur'an]], known to Muslims as [[Tafsir]], from [[Islamic University of Madinah]] in 1989. Nine years later, he completed a [[Master of Arts]] degree in the Muslim prophetic tradition, known as the [[Sunnah]], at Umm al-Qura University, where he would eventually complete his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctorate of Philosophy]] in Qur'anic exegesis in 2001.&lt;ref name=cover/&gt; He was promoted to the rank of associate professor at Umm al-Qura in 2006, and currently teaches exegesis. He is also a member of the university's academic board.&lt;ref name="Harbi"/&gt;

Harbi also has an [[Ijazah]] authorization in all ten [[Qira'at]], or variant methods of reciting the Qur'an, with a complete chain of narration going back to the original reciters of the Qur'an.&lt;ref name=cover/&gt; The majority of his published works, however, have been within the field of the [[Arabic language]], especially in regard to Arabic [[rhetoric]].{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

'''Beit She'arim''' ({{lang-he-n|בֵּית שְׁעָרִים}}, "House of the Gates") is  the currently used name for the ancient Jewish town of '''Bet She'arāyim''' ({{Hebrew|בּית שערַיִם}}, "House of Two Gates") or '''Kfar She'arāyim''' ({{Hebrew|כְּפר שערַיִם}}, "Village of Two Gates").&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt; The site, located on a hill, was known initially by its [[Arabic]] name '''Sheikh Ibreik''' or '''Sheikh Abreik''',&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt; and which historical geographer [[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]] in 1936 identified as Talmudic Beit She'arim.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 137 in: {{cite journal |last=Vitto|first=Fanny |title=Byzantine Mosaics at Bet She'arim: New Evidence for the History of the Site |journal='Atiqot |accessdate=31 August 2018 |volume=28|issue= |pages=115-146 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23458348 |date=1996|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}. In the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Kila'im'' 9:3), the town's name is written in an elided-consonant form, ({{Lang-he-n|בית שריי}}), which follows more closely the Greek transliteration in Josephus' ''[[Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' § 24, ({{lang-gr|Βησάραν}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another Arabic name is ''bayt al-ġurabāʾ'' ({{lang|ar|بيت الغرباء}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The partially excavated archaeological site consists mainly of an extensive [[necropolis]] of [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut tombs]] and some remains of the town itself. The site is managed by the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority|National Parks Authority]] as the '''Beit She'arim National Park'''. It borders the town of [[Kiryat Tiv'on]] on the northeast and is located five kilometres west of [[Moshav]] [[Beit She'arim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02881.html Modern Bet She'arim] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated 20&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Haifa]] in the southern foothills of the [[Lower Galilee]].

In 2015 it was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The rationale of the committee was as follows: The town's vast necropolis, carved out of soft limestone, contains more than 30 burial cave systems. Although only a portion of the necropolis has been excavated, it has been likened to a book inscribed in stone. Its catacombs, mausoleums, and sarcophagi are adorned with elaborate symbols and figures as well as an impressive quantity of incised and painted inscriptions in Hebrew, Aramaic, Palmyrene, and Greek, documenting two centuries of historical and cultural achievement. The wealth of artistic adornments contained in this, the most ancient extensive Jewish cemetery in the world, is unparalleled anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4676480,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1471], [[UNESCO world heritage site]],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
According to [[Moshe Sharon]], following [[Yechezkel Kutscher]], the name of the city was Beit She'arayim or Kfar She'arayim (the House/Village of Two Gates).&lt;ref name="Sharon"&gt;Sharon, Moshe (2004), Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae, Vol. III, D-F; page XXXVII [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR37#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Yemenite Jewish pronunciation of the name is also "Bet She'arayim", which is more closely related to the [[Ancient Greek]] rendition of the name, i.e. Βησάρα, "Besara".&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Talmud, Punctuated'' ({{Hebrew|תלמוד בבלי מנוקד}}), ed. Yosef Amar, Jerusalem 1980, s.v. ''Sanhedrin'' 32b (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular orthography for the Hebrew word for house, {{Hebrew|בֵּית}}, is "beit", while the traditional King James one is "beth", the effort being now to replace both with the etymologically better suited "bet".

==History==

===Iron Age===
Pottery shards discovered at the site indicate that a first settlement there dates back to the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Second Temple period===
[[File:BeitShearimSarcophagus1-v.jpg|thumb|200px|Two lions facing each other, a Greek mythological scene decorating a sarcophagus in the Cave of the Coffins]]
Beit She'arayim was founded at the end of the 1st century BCE, during the reign of King [[Herod the Great|Herod]].&lt;ref name=Mazar19&gt;Benjamin Mazar, ''Beth She'arim : Report on the Excavations during 1936-1940'', Vol. I, p19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus Flavius]], in his [[The Life of Flavius Josephus|''Vita'']], referred to the city in Greek as Besara, the administrative center of the estates of [[Berenice II of Egypt|Queen Berenice]] in the [[Jezreel Valley]].&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt;

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
[[Benjamin Mazar]] described it as a prosperous [[Jew]]ish town eventually destroyed by fire in 352, at the end of the [[Jewish revolt against Gallus]] and that after some time it was renewed as a [[Byzantine]] city,&lt;ref name=Mazar19/&gt; but more recent research shows that the Gallus revolt had a much lesser impact on the town.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; The [[Galilee earthquake of 363]] did damage Bet She'arayim, but without long-lasting effects.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

After the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, the  [[Sanhedrin]] (Jewish legislature and supreme council) moved to Beit She'arayim.&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt; The town is mentioned rabbinical literature as an important center of Jewish learning during the 2nd century.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; Rabbi [[Judah the Prince]] (Yehudah HaNasi), head of the Sanhedrin and compiler of the [[Mishna]], lived there. In the last seventeen years of his life, he moved to [[Sepphoris]] for health reasons, but planned his burial in Beit She'arim. According to tradition, he owned there land he received as a gift from his friend, the Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] Antoninus.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The most desired burial place for Jews was the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]], but in 135 CE, when Jews were barred from the area, Beit She'arim became an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhPlUt1kz-wC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=land+beit+she%27arim&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IHnzWvgzpQ&amp;sig=8ycK-VQl1S8C-BScn4fxQfR8iqI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=czzcSp_6NqSwnQPvpKzaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Holy Land: An Oxford archaeological guide, From earliest times to 1700, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried there led many other Jews from all over the country and from the [[Jewish Diaspora]], from nearby [[Phoenicia]]&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; to far-away [[Himyar]] in [[Yemen]],&lt;ref name="Hymiar"&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 53–57, 148, 283–284 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; to be buried next to his grave.

While it was originally thought that Bet She'arayim was destroyed during the [[Jewish revolt against Gallus]] in the mid-4th century, recent research has revealed the destruction to be far less extensive.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; An earthquake in 386 caused some damage, but the town recovered and enjoyed prosperity during the era of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]].&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; Almost 300 inscriptions primarily in [[Greek language|Greek]], but also in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] were found on the walls of the catacombs containing numerous sarcophagi.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Early Islamic period===
From the beginning of the Early Islamic period (7th century), settlement was sparse.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar, p20.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations uncovered 75 lamps dating to the period of [[Umayyad]] (7th-8th centuries) and [[Abassid]] (8th-13th centuries) rule over Palestine.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; A large Abbasid-period [[glassmaking]] facility from the 9th century was also found at the site (see [[Beit She'arim National Park#Glassmaking industry (Abbasid period)|below]]).

===Crusader period===
There is some evidence of activity in the former city area and necropolis dating to the [[Crusades|Crusader period]] (12th century), probably connected to travellers and temporary settlement.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Ottoman period===
A small Arab village called [[Sheikh Bureik, Lajjun|Sheikh Bureik]] was located here in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter; Abdulfattah, Kamal (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband, Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A map by [[Pierre Jacotin]]  from [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Napoleon's invasion of 1799]] showed the place, named as ''Cheik Abrit.''&lt;ref&gt;Karmon, 1960, p. [http://www.jchp.ucla.edu/Bibliography/Karmon,_Y_1960_Jacotin_Map_(IEJ_10).pdf 163]&lt;/ref&gt;

The village is mentioned again in [[Palestine Exploration Fund|The Survey of Western Palestine]] (SWP) citing data from 1859,&lt;ref name=SWP.273&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/273/mode/1up 273]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1875 by [[Victor Guérin]].&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1880, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr01unkngoog#page/n408/mode/1up  395]-397&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the Ottoman authorities sold Shayk Abreik (together with a total of 23 villages and some seventy square miles of land) for £20,000 to the  [[Sursuk family]] of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.  [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/356/mode/1up  356]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Survey of Western Palestine", published in 1881, describes Sheikh Abreik as a small village situated on a hill with a conspicuous [[Maqam (shrine)|''maqam'']] (sanctuary, holy tomb) located to the south. The village houses were made mostly of [[adobe|mud]], and it belonged to the Sursuk family. The population at this time was estimated to be around 150.&lt;ref name=SWP.273/&gt; During [[World War I]], the "finest oaks" of Sheikh Bureik were "ruthlessly destroyed" by the Turkish Army for use as rail fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, report of 1923, quoted by R. El-Eini, British forestry policy in Mandate Palestine 1929-48: Aims and realities, ''Middle Eastern Studies'', Vol. 35, 1999, pp 72–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Mandate===
The October [[1922 census of Palestine]] recorded Sheikh Abreik with a population of 111 Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Haifa, p. [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/PalestineCensus1922/p33.pdf  33]&lt;/ref&gt; At some time during the early 1920s, the Sursuk family sold the lands of the village to the [[Jewish National Fund]], via [[Yehoshua Hankin]], a [[Zionist]] activist who was responsible for most of the major land purchases of the [[World Zionist Organization]] in Ottoman Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Avneri, 1984, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Teb4dKHQcoC&amp;pg=PA122 122]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1925, according to [[Media:ShawSursockTable.png|List of villages sold by Sursocks and their partners to the Zionists since British occupation of Palestine]], evidence to the [[Shaw Commission]], 1930&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, which included lands from the Arab villages of Harithiya, Sheikh Abreik and [[Harbaj]], a total of 59 Arab tenants were evicted from the three villages, with 3,314 pounds compensation paid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth W. Stein]], ''The Land Question in Palestine, 1917-1939'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 an agricultural settlement also named Sheikh Abreik was established by the [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]], a Zionist political party and settlement movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Jewish Encyclopedia'', Vol 6, entry "Colonies, Agricultural", p287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[File:BeitShearimSarcophagus2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Visitors at the Cave of the Coffins]]
The archaeological importance of the site was recognized in the 1880s by the Survey of Western Palestine, which explored many tombs and catacombs but did no excavation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/343/mode/1up Survey of Western Palestine, Vol. I, pp. 325-328 and 343-351]&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village of Sheikh Bureik was located on the hill until the 1920s, when the land was purchased by the [[Jewish National Fund]].  In 1936, [[Alexander Zaïd]], employed by the JNF as a watchman, reported that he had found a breach in the wall of one of the caves which led into another cave decorated with inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar, p27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s and 1950s, the site was excavated by Benjamin Mazar and [[Nahman Avigad]].

===Jewish necropolis===
Most of the remains date from the 2nd to 4th century CE. A large number of individuals were buried in the more than twenty catacombs of the necropolis. Geographical references in inscriptions on the walls of the catacombs reveal that the necropolis was used by people from the town of Beit She'arim, from elsewhere in Galilee, and even from cities as far away as [[Palmyra]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East'' considers Beth She'arim of international importance (Volume 1, p. 309-11); Tessa Rajak considers its importance regional ("The rabbinic dead and the Diaspora dead at Beth She’arim" in P. Schäfer (ed.), ''The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture'' 1 (Tübingen 1997), p. 349-66); S. Schwartz however, in ''Imperialism and Jewish society, 200 B.C.E. to 640 C.E.'' (Princeton 2001), p. 153-8, plays down the importance of Beth She'arim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from an extensive body of inscriptions in several languages, the walls and tombs have many images, engraved and carved in [[relief]], ranging from Jewish symbols and geometric decoration to animals and figures from Hellenistic myth and religion.&lt;ref name="Beth She'arim"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1643/ Beth She'arim], [[UNESCO world heritage site]] "tentative list", summary from 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, two new caves were opened to the public whose burial vaults date to the first two centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1124426.html Row erupts over discovery of Beit Shearim caves, [[Haaretz]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cave of Judah the Prince====
The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] cites Beit She'arim as the burial place of Rabbi [[Judah the Prince]], Yehuda HaNasi in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Kelaim 9, 32a-b&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral is described as follows: "Miracles were wrought on that day. It was evening and all the towns gathered to mourn him, and eighteen synagogues praised him and bore him to Bet Shearim, and the daylight remained until everyone reached his home (Ketubot 12, 35a)." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/97mag/betshearim/betshearim.htm Bet Shearim archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried here is believed to be a major reason for the popularity of the necropolis in Late Antiquity. The catacomb No. 14 is likely to have belonged to the family of Rabbi Judah the Prince.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Beit She'arim - The Jewish necropolis of the Roman Period |author= |work=www.mfa.gov.il |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=2000 |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/beit%20she-arim%20-%20the%20jewish%20necropolis%20of%20the%20roman.aspx |accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clear inscription stating the name and title of Rabbi Judah the Prince in that catacomb identifies it as his burial site.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East'', Volume 1, p. 309-11.

====Himyarite tombs====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Yemenite Jews]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
[[File:Tomb Inscription of Himyarite buried in Beit She'arim National Park (Israel).jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Himyarite, in Greek uncials]]

In 1937, [[Benjamin Mazar]] revealed at Beit She'arim a system of tombs belonging to the Jews of [[Himyar]] (now [[Yemen]]) dating back to the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946,  pp. 53–57, 148, 283–284 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of ties between Yemenite Jewry and the Land of Israel can be learnt by the system of tombs at Beit She'arim dating back to the 3rd century. It is of great significance that Jews from Ḥimyar were being brought for interment in what was then considered a prestigious place, near the catacombs of the [[Sanhedrin]]. Those who had the financial means brought their dead to be buried in the Land of Israel, as it was considered an outstanding virtue for Jews not to be buried in foreign lands, but rather in the land of their forefathers. It is speculated that the Ḥimyarites, during their lifetime, were known and respected in the eyes of those who dwelt in the Land of Israel, seeing that one of them, whose name was Menaḥem, was coined the epithet ''qyl ḥmyr'' [prince of Ḥimyar], in the eight-character Ḥimyari ligature, while in the Greek inscription he was called ''Menae presbyteros'' (Menaḥem, the community's elder).&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies, 43 (2013): British Museum, London; Article by Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen in light of the excavation of the Jewish synagogue in Qanī’'', p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of a woman written in Greek in its genitive form, Ενλογιαζ, is also engraved there, meaning either 'virtue', 'blessing', or 'gratis'; however, its precise transcription remains of scholarly dispute.&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 56 – 57; p. 33 plate b. Christian Robin rejects the interpretation of the ligature ''qyl ḥmyr''. He notes that today the inscription ''Menae presbyteros'' can no longer be seen. The only secured inscription is ''Ômêritôn'' [the Ḥimyari].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbasid period===

====Glassmaking industry====
In 1956, a bulldozer working at the site unearthed an enormous rectangular slab, 11×6.5×1.5 feet, weighing 9 tons. Initially, it was paved over, but it was eventually studied and found to be a gigantic piece of glass. A [[glassmaking]] furnace was located here in the 9th century during the [[History of Palestine#Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid periods|Abbasid period]], which produced great batches of molten glass that were cooled and later broken into small pieces for crafting glass vessels.&lt;ref name=Negev&gt;Negev and Gibson, 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=sheikh+ibreik&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=sheikh%20ibreik&amp;f=false  pp86-87].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=9420 The Mystery Slab of Beit She'arim, Corning Glass Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:מערת_הלולבים.JPG|thumb|"Cave of the [[Lulav]]im"]]

====Poem inside catacomb====
An [[elegy]] written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] script typical of the 9-10th century and containing the date AH 287 or 289 (AD 900 or 902) was found in the ''Magharat al-Jahannam'' ("Cave of Hell") catacomb during excavations conducted there in 1956. The sophisticated and beautifully worded elegy was composed by the previously unknown poet Umm al-Qasim, whose name is given in [[acrostic]] in the poem, and it can be read in Moshe Sharon's book or [[Sheikh Bureik, Lajjun#Poem from Abbasid period|here]] on Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Sharon.xli&gt;Sharon, 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;pg=PR41 xli]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshe Sharon speculates that this poem might be marking the beginning of the practice of treating this site as the sanctuary of Sheikh Ibreik and suggests the site was used for burial at this time and possibly later as well.&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharon.xlii&gt;Sharon, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;pg=PR42  p.xlii]&lt;/ref&gt; He further notes that the cave within which the inscription was found forms part of a vast area of ancient ruins which constituted a natural place for the emergence of a local shrine. Drawing on the work of Tawfiq Canaan, Sharon cites his observation that 32% of the sacred sites he visited in Palestine were located in the vicinity of ancient ruins.&lt;ref name=Sharon.xlii/&gt;

===Recent excavations===
[[File:The gate of Bet Shearim 01.jpg|250px|thumb|The gate of Bet Shearim  that eas published on January 2017]]
The excavations at the site were resumed by  Adi Erlich, on behalf of the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, The [[University of Haifa]]. Erlich is focusing her excavation on the hilltop above the necropolis, where the ancient town had existed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Beth-Shearim-Excavation/556477027790445 Official Facebook page of renewed expedition]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bending moment'''  is the reaction induced in a [[structural element]] when an external [[force]] or [[Moment of force|moment]] is applied to the element causing the element to [[bending|bend]].&lt;ref name=timo/&gt;&lt;ref name=beer/&gt; The most common or simplest structural element subjected to bending moments is the [[Beam (structure)|beam]].  The diagram shows a beam which is simply supported at both ends.  Simply supported means that each end of the beam can rotate; therefore each end support has no bending moment. The ends can only react to the shear loads.  Other beams can have both ends fixed; therefore each end support has both bending moment and shear reaction loads. Beams can also have one end fixed and one end simply supported.  The simplest type of beam is the cantilever, which is fixed at one end and is free at the other end (neither simple or fixed). In reality, beam supports are usually neither absolutely fixed nor absolutely rotating freely.

The internal reaction loads in a [[cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of the structural element can be resolved into a [[resultant force]] and a resultant [[couple (mechanics)|couple]].  For equilibrium, the moment created by external forces (and external moments) must be balanced by the couple induced by the internal loads.  The resultant internal couple is called the '''bending moment''' while the resultant internal force is called the '''shear force''' (if it is transverse to the plane of element) or the '''normal force''' (if it is along the plane of the element).

The bending moment at a [[cross section (geometry)|section]] through a structural element may be defined as "the sum of the moments about that section of all external forces acting to one side of that section". The forces and moments on either side of the section must be equal in order to counteract each other and maintain a state of [[Dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] so the same bending moment will result from summing the moments, regardless of which side of the section is selected. If clockwise bending moments are taken as negative, then a negative bending moment within an element will cause "sagging", and a positive moment will cause "hogging". It is therefore clear that a point of zero bending moment within a [[Beam (structure)|beam]] is a point of [[contraflexure]]&amp;mdash;that is the point of transition from hogging to sagging or vice versa.

Moments and [[torque]]s are measured as a force multiplied by a distance so they have as unit [[newton-metre]]s (N·m), or [[pound-foot (torque)|pound-foot]] (lbf·ft). The concept of bending moment is very important in [[engineering]] (particularly in [[Civil engineering|civil]] and [[mechanical engineering]]) and [[physics]].

== Background ==
[[Tensile]] and [[compressive]] stresses increase proportionally with bending moment, but are also dependent on the [[second moment of area]] of the cross-section of a beam (that is, the shape of the cross-section, such as a circle, square or I-beam being common structural shapes). Failure in bending will occur when the bending moment is sufficient to induce tensile stresses greater than the [[Yield (engineering)|yield]] stress of the material throughout the entire cross-section.  In structural analysis, this bending failure is called a plastic hinge, since the full load carrying ability of the structural element is not reached until the full cross-section is past the yield stress.  It is possible that failure of a structural element in [[Shearing (physics)|shear]] may occur before failure in bending, however the mechanics of failure in shear and in bending are different.

Moments are calculated by multiplying the external [[vector (geometric)|vector]] [[force]]s (loads or reactions) by the vector distance at which they are applied. When analysing an entire element, it is sensible to calculate moments at both ends of the element, at the beginning, centre and end of any uniformly distributed loads, and directly underneath any point loads. Of course any "pin-joints" within a structure allow free rotation, and so zero moment occurs at these points as there is no way of transmitting turning forces from one side to the other.

It is more common to use the convention that a clockwise bending moment to the left of the point under consideration is taken as positive. This then corresponds to the second derivative of a function which, when positive, indicates a curvature that is 'lower at the centre' i.e. sagging. When defining moments and curvatures in this way calculus can be more readily used to find slopes and deflections.

Critical values within the beam are most commonly annotated using a [[Shear and moment diagram|bending moment diagram]], where negative moments are plotted to scale above a horizontal line and positive below. Bending moment varies linearly over unloaded sections, and parabolically over uniformly loaded sections.

Engineering descriptions of the computation of bending moments can be confusing because of unexplained sign conventions and implicit assumptions.  The descriptions below use vector mechanics to compute moments of force and bending moments in an attempt to explain, from first principles, why particular sign conventions are chosen.

== Computing the moment of force ==
[[File:beam moment plain.svg|thumb|300px|Computing the moment of force in a beam.]]
An important part of determining bending moments in practical problems is the computation of moments of force.
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; be a force vector acting at a point '''A''' in a body.  The moment of this force about a reference point ('''O''') is defined as&lt;ref name=beer&gt;{{Citation|last=Beer|first=F.|last2=Johnston|first2=E.R.|title=Vector mechanics for engineers: statics|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=1984|pages=62–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}  = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F}
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{M}&lt;/math&gt; is the moment vector and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; is the position vector from the reference point ('''O''') to the point of application of the force ('''A''').  The &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; symbol indicates the vector cross product.  For many problems, it is more convenient to compute the moment of force about an axis that passes through the reference point '''O'''.  If the unit vector along the axis is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;, the moment of force about the axis is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
   M = \mathbf{e}\cdot\mathbf{M} = \mathbf{e}\cdot(\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F})
 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; indicates the vector dot product.

===  Example ===
The adjacent figure shows a beam that is acted upon by a force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.  If the coordinate system is defined by the three unit vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_x, \mathbf{e}_y, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;, we have the following 
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{F} = 0\,\mathbf{e}_x - F\,\mathbf{e}_y + 0\,\mathbf{e}_z
   \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{r} = x\,\mathbf{e}_x + 0\,\mathbf{e}_y + 0\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F} = \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{e}_x &amp;  \mathbf{e}_y &amp;  \mathbf{e}_z \\ x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -F &amp; 0 
         \end{matrix}\right| = -Fx\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The moment about the axis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; is then
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_z = \mathbf{e}_z\cdot\mathbf{M} = -Fx \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;

=== Sign conventions ===
The negative value suggests that a moment that tends to rotate a body clockwise around an axis should have a '''negative''' sign.  However, the actual sign depends on the choice of the three axes &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_x, \mathbf{e}_y, \mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt;.  For instance, if we choose another right handed coordinate system with &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}_x = \mathbf{e}_x, \mathbf{E}_y = -\mathbf{e}_z, \mathbf{E}_z = \mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt;, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{F} = 0\,\mathbf{E}_x + 0\,\mathbf{E}_y -F\,\mathbf{E}_z
   \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{r} = x\,\mathbf{E}_x + 0\,\mathbf{E}_y + 0\,\mathbf{E}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Then,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} = \mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F} = \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{E}_x &amp;  \mathbf{E}_y &amp;  \mathbf{E}_z \\ x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -F 
         \end{matrix}\right| = Fx\,\mathbf{E}_y 
   \quad \text{and} \quad M_y = \mathbf{E}_y\cdot\mathbf{M} = Fx \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
For this new choice of axes, a '''positive''' moment tends to rotate body clockwise around an axis.

== Computing the bending moment ==
In a rigid body or in an unconstrained deformable body, the application of a moment of force causes a pure rotation.  But if a deformable body is constrained, it develops internal forces in response to the external force so that equilibrium is maintained.  An example is shown in the figure below.  These internal forces will cause local deformations in the body.

For equilibrium, the sum of the internal force vectors is equal to the applied external force and the sum of the moment vectors created by the internal forces is equal to the moment of the external force.  The internal force and moment vectors are oriented in such a way that the total force (internal + external) and moment (external + internal) of the system is zero.  The internal moment vector is called the '''bending moment'''.&lt;ref name=timo&gt;{{Citation|last=Gere|first=J.M.|last2=Timoshenko|first2=S.P.|title=Mechanics of Materials:Forth edition|year=1996|publisher=Nelson Engineering|isbn=0534934293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though bending moments have been used to determine the stress states in arbitrary shaped structures, the physical interpretation of the computed stresses is problematic.  However, physical interpretations of bending moments in beams and plates have a straightforward interpretation as the [[stress resultants]] in a cross-section of the structural element.  For example, in a beam in the figure, the bending moment vector due to stresses in the cross-section ''A'' perpendicular to the ''x''-axis is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}_x = \int_A \mathbf{r} \times (\sigma_{xx} \mathbf{e}_x + \sigma_{xy} \mathbf{e}_y + \sigma_{xz} \mathbf{e}_z)\, dA 
   \quad \text{where} \quad 
    \mathbf{r} = y\,\mathbf{e}_y + z\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt; 
Expanding this expression we have,
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M}_x = \int_A \left(-y\sigma_{xx}\mathbf{e}_z + y\sigma_{xz}\mathbf{e}_x + z\sigma_{xx}\mathbf{e}_y - z\sigma_{xy}\mathbf{e}_x\right)dA =: M_{xx}\,\mathbf{e}_x + M_{xy}\,\mathbf{e}_y + M_{xz}\,\mathbf{e}_z\,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
We define the bending moment components as 
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix} M_{xx} \\ M_{xy} \\M_{xz} \end{bmatrix}
    := \int_A \begin{bmatrix} y\sigma_{xz} - z\sigma_{xy} \\ z\sigma_{xx} \\ -y\sigma_{xx} \end{bmatrix}\,dA \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
The internal moments are computed about an origin that is at the neutral axis of the beam or plate and the integration is through the thickness (&lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;)

=== Example ===
[[File:beam bending moment plain.svg|thumb|300px|Computing the bending moment in a beam.]]
In the beam shown in the adjacent figure, the external forces are the applied force at point '''A''' (&lt;math&gt;-F\mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt;) and the reactions at the two support points '''O''' and '''B''' (&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{R}_O = R_O\mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{R}_B = R_B\mathbf{e}_y&lt;/math&gt;).  The reactions can be computed using balances of forces and moments about point '''A''', i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;
    R_O + R_B - F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad -\mathbf{r}_A\times\mathbf{R}_O + \mathbf{r}_B\times\mathbf{R}_B = \mathbf{0} \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the beam, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{r}_A = x_A\mathbf{e}_x \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{r}_B = (L-x_A)\mathbf{e}_x \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
If we solve for the reactions we have
:&lt;math&gt;
   R_O = \left(1 - \frac{x_A}{L}\right) F \quad \text{and} \quad R_B = \frac{x_A}{L}\,F \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
Looking at the free body diagram of the part of the beam to the left of point '''X''', the total moment of the external forces about the point '''X''' is
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} = -(\mathbf{r}_X-\mathbf{r}_A)\times\mathbf{F} - \mathbf{r}_X\times\mathbf{R}_O = 
         \left[(x_A-x)\mathbf{e}_x\right]\times\left(-F\mathbf{e}_y\right)
         - \left(x\mathbf{e}_x\right)\times\left(R_O\mathbf{e}_y\right) \,.
&lt;/math&gt;
If we compute the cross products, we have
:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathbf{M} 
       = \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{e}_x &amp; \mathbf{e}_y &amp; \mathbf{e}_z \\ x_A - x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -F &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right| -
         \left|\begin{matrix}\mathbf{e}_x &amp; \mathbf{e}_y &amp; \mathbf{e}_z \\ x &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; R_0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right|
       = F(x-x_A)\,\mathbf{e}_z -R_0x\,\mathbf{e}_z = -\frac{F x_A}{L}(L-x)\,\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
For this situation, the only non-zero component of the bending moment is
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{M}_{xz} = -\left[\int_z\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y\,\sigma_{xx}\,dy\,dz\right]\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
For the sum of the moments at '''X''' about the axis &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_z&lt;/math&gt; to be zero, we require
:&lt;math&gt;
   \mathbf{M} + \mathbf{M}_{xz} = \mathbf{0} \quad \text{or} \quad -\frac{F x_A}{L}(L-x) + M_{xz} = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad M_{xz} =\frac{F x_A}{L}(L-x)  \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
At &lt;math&gt;x = x_A&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;M_{xz} = Fx_A(L-x_A)/L&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Sign convention ===
In the above discussion, it is implicitly assumed that the bending moment is positive when the top of the beam is compressed.  That can be seen if we consider a linear distribution of stress in the beam and find the resulting bending moment.  Let the top of the beam be in compression with a stress &lt;math&gt;-\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt; and let the bottom of the beam have a stress &lt;math&gt;\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the stress distribution in the beam is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{xx}(y) = -y\sigma_0&lt;/math&gt;.  The bending moment due to these stresses is
:&lt;math&gt;
   M_{xz} = -\left[\int_z\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y\,(-y\sigma_0)\,dy\,dz\right] = \sigma_0\,I
 &lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is the [[area moment of inertia]] of the cross-section of the beam.   Therefore the bending moment is positive when the top of the beam is in compression.

Many authors follow a different convention in which the stress resultant &lt;math&gt;M_{xz}&lt;/math&gt; is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;
    \mathbf{M}_{xz} = \left[\int_z\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} y\,\sigma_{xx}\,dy\,dz\right]\mathbf{e}_z \,.
 &lt;/math&gt;
In that case, positive bending moments imply that the top of the beam is in tension.  Of course, the definition of '''top''' depends on the coordinate system being used.  In the examples above, the top is the location with the largest &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-coordinate.

Along these lines, one can see the biosphere — the [[earth]] as it is affected by the [[human]] — as the adaptation of the natural to the human and biocultures as the inter-adaptation of the human to the new technologies and ways of knowing characterized by the 21st century’s attitude toward the [[Human body|body]]. It assumes that in bioculture there's a diverse way to know the workings of the body and mind, and that these are primarily culturally derived, and an expert's way of knowing produces specific strong results. However the results do not have an exclusive purview over the body and [[mind]]. Plus it seeks to develop and encourage not only the experts but also parts of people's bodies and minds as the subject of study.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd B, "Getting it all wrong - Bioculture critiques cultural critique" American Scholar  75 (4): 18-30 Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melby MK, Smith EO "PMS: A bioculture-bound syndrome."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19066">'''Cellular noise''' is random variability in quantities arising in [[cellular biology]]. For example, cells which are genetically identical, even within the same tissue, are often observed to have different expression levels of proteins, different sizes and structures.&lt;ref name = "kaernrev" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "oshearev" /&gt; These apparently random differences can have important biological and medical consequences.&lt;ref name = "johnstonsig" /&gt;

Cellular noise was originally, and is still often, examined in the context of gene expression levels – either the concentration or copy number of the products of genes within and between cells. As [[gene expression]] levels are responsible for many fundamental properties in cellular biology, including cells' physical appearance, behaviour in response to stimuli, and ability to process information and control internal processes, the presence of noise in gene expression has profound implications for many processes in cellular biology.

== Definitions ==
The most frequent quantitative definition of noise is the [[coefficient of variation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\eta_X = \frac{\sigma_X}{\mu_X},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta_X&lt;/math&gt; is the noise in a quantity &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean]] value of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard deviation]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This measure is [[dimensionless]], allowing a relative comparison of the importance of noise, without necessitating knowledge of the absolute mean.

Other quantities often used for mathematical convenience are the [[Fano factor]]:

: &lt;math&gt;F_X = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{\mu_X}.&lt;/math&gt;

and the normalized variance:

: &lt;math&gt;N_X = \eta_X^2 = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{\mu_X^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Intrinsic and extrinsic noise ==
[[File:Extrinsic and intrinsic noise in cellular biology.svg|thumb|300px|right|A schematic illustration of a dual reporter study. Each data point corresponds to a measurement of the expression level of two identically-regulated genes in a single cell: the scatter reflects measurements of a population of cells. Extrinsic noise is characterised by expression levels of both genes covarying between cells, intrinsic by internal differences.]]

Cellular noise is often investigated in the framework of ''intrinsic'' and ''extrinsic'' noise. Intrinsic noise refers to variation in identically-regulated quantities within a single cell: for example, the intra-cell variation in expression levels of two identically-controlled genes. Extrinsic noise refers to variation in identically-regulated quantities between different cells: for example, the cell-to-cell variation in expression of a given gene.

Intrinsic and extrinsic noise levels are often compared in '''dual reporter studies''', in which the expression levels of two identically-regulated genes (often fluorescent reporters like [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] and [[Yellow fluorescent protein|YFP]]) are plotted for each cell in a population.&lt;ref name = "elowitz" /&gt;

== Sources ==
''Note'': These lists are illustrative, not exhaustive, and identification of noise sources is an active and expanding area of research.

;Intrinsic noise
* ''Low copy-number effects (including discrete birth and death events)'': the random ([[stochastic]]) nature of production and degradation of cellular components means that noise is high for components at low copy number (as the magnitude of these random fluctuations is not negligible with respect to the copy number);
* ''Diffusive cellular dynamics'':&lt;ref name = "tenwolde" /&gt; many important cellular processes rely on collisions between reactants (for example, RNA polymerase and DNA) and other physical criteria which, given the [[Diffusion|diffusive]] dynamic nature of the cell, occur stochastically.
* ''Noise propagation'': Low copy-number effects and diffusive dynamics result in each of the biochemical reactions in a cell occurring randomly. Stochasticity of reactions can be either attenuated or amplified. Contribution each reaction makes to the intrinsic variability in copy numbers can be quantified via [[system size expansion|Van Kampen's system size expansion]].&lt;ref name = "decomposingnoise" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "stochdecomp" /&gt;
;Extrinsic noise
* ''Cellular age / cell cycle stage'': cells in a dividing population that is not synchronised will, at a given snapshot in time, be at different [[cell cycle]] stages, with corresponding biochemical and physical differences;&lt;ref name = "newman" /&gt;
* ''Physical environment (temperature, pressure, ...)'': physical quantities and chemical concentrations (particularly in the case of cell-to-cell signalling) may vary spatially across a population of cells, provoking extrinsic differences as a function of position;&lt;ref name = "athale" /&gt;
* ''Organelle distributions'': random factors in the quantity and quality of organelles (for example, the number and functionality of [[mitochondria]]&lt;ref name = 'dasneves' /&gt;) lead to significant cell-to-cell differences in a range of processes&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt; (as, for example, mitochondria play a central role in the energy budget of eukaryotic cells);
* ''Inheritance noise'': uneven partitioning of cellular components between daughter cells at [[mitosis]] can result in large extrinsic differences in a dividing population.&lt;ref name = "huh" /&gt;

Note that extrinsic noise can affect levels and types of intrinsic noise:&lt;ref name = "shahrezaei" /&gt; for example, extrinsic differences in the mitochondrial content of cells lead, through differences in [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] levels, to some cells transcribing faster than others, affecting the rates of gene expression and the magnitude of intrinsic noise across the population.&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt;

== Effects ==
''Note'': These lists are illustrative, not exhaustive, and identification of noise effects is an active and expanding area of research.

* ''Gene expression levels'': noise in gene expression causes differences in the fundamental properties of cells, limits their ability to biochemically control cellular dynamics,&lt;ref name = "lestas" /&gt; and directly or indirectly induce many of the specific effects below;
* ''Energy levels and transcription rate'': [[Transcriptional noise|noise in transcription rate]], arising from sources including [[transcriptional bursting]], is a significant source of noise in expression levels of genes. Extrinsic noise in [[mitochondria]]l content has been suggested to propagate to differences in the ATP concentrations and transcription rates (with functional relationships implied between these three quantities) in cells, affecting cells' energetic competence and ability to express genes;&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt;
* ''Phenotype selection'': bacterial populations exploit extrinsic noise to choose a population subset to enter a quiescent state.&lt;ref name = "fraser" /&gt; In a bacterial infection, for example, this subset will not propagate quickly but will be more robust when the population is threatened by antibiotic treatment: the rapidly replicating, infectious bacteria will be killed more quickly than the quiescent subset, which may be capable of restarting the infection. This phenomenon is why courses of antibiotics should be finished even when symptoms seem to have disappeared;
* ''Development and stem cell differentiation'': [[developmental noise]] in biochemical processes which need to be tightly controlled (for example, patterning of gene expression levels that develop into different body parts) during organismal development can have dramatic consequences, necessitating the evolution of robust cellular machinery. [[Stem cells]] differentiate into different cell types depending on the expression levels of various characteristic genes:&lt;ref name = "enver" /&gt; noise in gene expression can clearly perturb and influence this process, and noise in transcription rate can affect the structure of the dynamic landscape that differentiation occurs on;&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt;
* ''Cancer treatments'': recent work has found extrinsic differences, linked to gene expression levels, in the response of cancer cells to anti-cancer treatments, potentially linking the phenomenon of fractional killing (whereby each treatment kills some but not all of a tumour) to noise in gene expression.&lt;ref name = "spencer" /&gt;  Because individual cells could repeatedly and stochastically perform transitions between states associated with differences in responsiveness to a therapeutic modality (chemotherapy, targeted agent, radiation, etc.), therapy might need to be administered frequently (to ensure cells are treated soon after entering a therapy-responsive state, before they can rejoin the therapy-resistant subpopulation and proliferate) and over long times (to treat even those cells emerging late from the final residue of the therapy-resistant subpopulation).&lt;ref name = "liaoconceptualizing" /&gt;
* ''Information processing'': as cellular regulation is performed with components that are themselves subject to noise, the ability of cells to process information and perform control is fundamentally limited by intrinsic noise&lt;ref name = "lestas" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "swaininfo" /&gt;

== Analysis ==
[[File:Modelling stochastic gene expression.svg|thumb|400px|A canonical model for stochastic gene expression, known as the two-state or telegraph &lt;ref name = "pecoud" /&gt; model. DNA flips between "inactive" and "active" states (involving, for example, [[chromatin|chromatin remodelling]] and [[transcription factor]] binding). Active DNA is transcribed to produce mRNA which is translated to produce protein, both of which are degraded. All processes are [[Poisson process|Poissonian]] with given rates.]]

As many quantities of cell biological interest are present in discrete copy number within the cell (single DNAs, dozens of mRNAs, hundreds of proteins), tools from discrete [[Stochastic process|stochastic mathematics]] are often used to analyse and model cellular noise.&lt;ref name = "paulsson" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "wilkinson" /&gt; In particular, [[master equation]] treatments – where the probabilities &lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; of observing a system in a state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; are linked through [[Ordinary differential equation|ODEs]] – have proved particularly fruitful. A canonical model for noise gene expression, where the processes of [[Transcription factor|DNA activation]], [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] are all represented as [[Poisson processes]] with given rates, gives a master equation which may be solved exactly (with [[generating functions]]) under various assumptions or approximated with stochastic tools like [[system size expansion|Van Kampen's system size expansion]].

Numerically, the [[Gillespie algorithm]] or stochastic simulation algorithm is often used to create realisations of stochastic cellular processes, from which statistics can be calculated.

The problem of inferring the values of parameters in stochastic models ([[Parametric statistics|parametric inference]]) for biological processes, which are typically characterised by sparse and noisy experimental data, is an active field of research, with methods including [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|Bayesian MCMC]] and [[approximate Bayesian computation]] proving adaptable and robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sunnåker et al |title=Approximate bayesian computation |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |date=2013 |volume=9 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the two-state model, a moment-based method was described for parameters inference from mRNAs distributions.&lt;ref name = "pecoud" /&gt;

In [[Computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], the '''Church–Turing thesis''' (also known as '''computability thesis''',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Soare]], [http://www.people.cs.uchicago.edu/~soare/History/turing.pdf "Turing Oracle Machines, Online Computing, and Three Displacements in Computability Theory"]&lt;/ref&gt; the  '''Turing–Church thesis''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | last = Rabin | first = Michael O. | author-link = Michael O. Rabin | title = Turing, Church, Gödel, Computability, Complexity and Randomization: A Personal View | date = June 2012 | url = http://videolectures.net/turing100_rabin_turing_church_goedel/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Church–Turing conjecture''', '''Church's thesis''', '''Church's conjecture''', and '''Turing's thesis''') is a [[hypothesis]] about the nature of [[computable function]]s. It states that a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on the [[natural numbers]] is computable by a human being following an algorithm, ignoring resource limitations, if and only if it is computable by a [[Turing machine]]. The thesis is named after American mathematician [[Alonzo Church]] and the British mathematician [[Alan Turing]]. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term [[effectively calculable]] to describe functions that are computable by paper-and-pencil methods. In the 1930s, several independent attempts were made to [[formal system|formalize]] the notion of [[computability]]:

* In 1933, Austrian-American mathematician [[Kurt Gödel]], with [[Jacques Herbrand]], created a formal definition of a class called [[μ-recursive function|general recursive functions]]. The class of general recursive functions is the smallest class of functions (possibly with more than one argument) which includes all [[constant function]]s, projections, the [[successor function]], and which is closed under [[function composition]], [[recursion]], and [[μ operator|minimization]].
* In 1936, [[Alonzo Church]] created a method for defining functions called the [[Lambda calculus|λ-calculus]]. Within λ-calculus, he defined an encoding of the natural numbers called the [[Church numerals]]. A function on the natural numbers is called [[Lambda-recursive function|λ-computable]] if the corresponding function on the Church numerals can be represented by a term of the λ-calculus.
* Also in 1936, before learning of Church's work, [[Alan Turing]] created a theoretical model for machines, now called Turing machines, that could carry out calculations from inputs by manipulating symbols on a tape. Given a suitable encoding of the natural numbers as sequences of symbols, a function on the natural numbers is called [[computable function|Turing computable]] if some Turing machine computes the corresponding function on encoded natural numbers.

Church&lt;ref&gt;Church 1934:90 footnote in Davis 1952&lt;/ref&gt; and Turing&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–7 in Davis 1952:149&lt;/ref&gt; proved that these three formally defined classes of computable functions coincide: a function is λ-computable if and only if it is Turing computable if and only if it is ''general recursive''. This has led mathematicians and computer scientists to believe that the concept of computability is accurately characterized by these three equivalent processes. Other formal attempts to characterize computability have subsequently strengthened this belief (see [[Church–Turing thesis#Success of the thesis|below]]).

On the other hand, the Church–Turing thesis states that the above three formally-defined classes of computable functions coincide with the ''informal'' notion of an effectively calculable function. Since, as an informal notion, the concept of effective calculability does not have a formal definition, the thesis, although it has near-universal acceptance, cannot be formally proven.

Since its inception, variations on the original thesis have arisen, including statements about what can physically be realized by a computer in our universe ([[physical Church-Turing thesis]]) and what can be efficiently computed ([[#complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis|Church–Turing thesis (complexity theory)]]). These variations are not due to Church or Turing, but arise from later work in [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] and [[digital physics]]. The thesis also has implications for the [[philosophy of mind]] (see [[Church–Turing thesis#Philosophical implications|below]]).

==Statement in Church's and Turing's words==
{{See also|Effectively calculable}}

{{harvs|txt=yes|author-link=J. Barkley Rosser|first=J. B.|last=Rosser|date=1939}} addresses the notion of "effective computability" as follows: "Clearly the existence of CC and RC (Church's and Rosser's proofs) presupposes a precise definition of 'effective'. '[[Effective method]]' is here used in the rather special sense of a method each step of which is precisely predetermined and which is certain to produce the answer in a finite number of steps".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rosser|1939}} in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=225}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the adverb-adjective "effective" is used in a sense of "1a: producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect", and "capable of producing a result".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|entry=effective|dictionary=Merriam Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite dictionary |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/effective |entry=effective |dictionary=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary |edition=11th |access-date=July 26, 2014|postscript=,}} which also gives these definitions for "effective" – the first ["producing a decided, decisive, or desired effect"] as the definition for sense "1a" of the word "effective", and the second ["capable of producing a result"] as part of the "Synonym Discussion of EFFECTIVE" there, (in the introductory part, where it summarizes the similarities between the meanings of the words "effective", "effectual", "efficient", and "efficacious").&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following, the words "effectively calculable" will mean "produced by any intuitively 'effective' means whatsoever" and "effectively computable" will mean "produced by a Turing-machine or equivalent mechanical device". Turing's "definitions" given in a footnote in his 1939 Ph.D. thesis ''[[Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals]]'', supervised by Church, are virtually the same:
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{sup|†}} We shall use the expression "computable function" to mean a function calculable by a machine, and let "effectively calculable" refer to the intuitive idea without particular identification with any one of these definitions.&lt;ref name=Turing_1939_thesis_p8&gt;{{cite thesis |first=A.M. |last=Turing |date=1939 |url=https://webspace.princeton.edu/users/jedwards/Turing%20Centennial%202012/Mudd%20Archive%20files/12285_AC100_Turing_1938.pdf |format=PDF |title=Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals |type=PhD |publisher=Princeton University |page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The thesis can be stated as: ''Every effectively calculable function is a computable function''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Gandy|1980|p=123}} states it this way: ''What is effectively calculable is computable.'' He calls this "Church's Thesis".&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing stated it this way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It was stated&amp;nbsp;... that "a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process". We may take this literally, understanding that by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. The development&amp;nbsp;... leads to&amp;nbsp;... an identification of computability{{sup|†}} with effective calculability. [{{sup|†}} is the footnote quoted above.]&lt;ref name=Turing_1939_thesis_p8/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Church–Turing thesis}}

One of the important problems for logicians in the 1930s was [[David Hilbert]]'s [[Entscheidungsproblem]], which asked whether there was a mechanical procedure for separating mathematical truths from mathematical falsehoods. This quest required that the notion of "algorithm" or "effective calculability" be pinned down, at least well enough for the quest to begin.&lt;ref&gt;Davis's commentary before Church 1936 ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' in Davis 1965:88. Church uses the words "effective calculability" on page 100ff.&lt;/ref&gt; But from the very outset [[Alonzo Church]]'s attempts began with a debate that continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;In his review of ''Church's Thesis after 70 Years'' edited by Adam Olszewski et al. 2006, Peter Smith's criticism of a paper by Muraswski and Wolenski suggests 4 "lines" re the status of the Church–Turing Thesis: (1) empirical hypothesis (2) axiom or theorem, (3) definition, (4) explication. But Smith opines that (4) is indistinguishable from (3), cf Smith (July 11, 2007) ''Church's Thesis after 70 Years'' at http://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/CTT.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Was the notion of "effective calculability" to be (i) an "axiom or axioms" in an axiomatic system, (ii) merely a ''definition'' that "identified" two or more propositions, (iii) an ''empirical hypothesis'' to be verified by observation of natural events, or (iv) just ''a proposal'' for the sake of argument (i.e. a "thesis").

=== Circa 1930–1952 ===
In the course of studying the problem, Church and his student [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] introduced the notion of [[Lambda calculus|λ-definable functions]], and they were able to prove that several large classes of functions frequently encountered in number theory were λ-definable.&lt;ref&gt;cf footnote 3 in {{harvnb|Church|1936a}} ''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory'' in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate began when Church proposed to Gödel that one should define the "effectively computable" functions as the λ-definable functions. Gödel, however, was not convinced and called the proposal "thoroughly unsatisfactory".&lt;ref&gt;Dawson 1997:99.{{Full citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, in correspondence with Church (c. 1934–35), Gödel proposed ''axiomatizing'' the notion of "effective calculability"; indeed, in a 1935 letter to Kleene, Church reported that:

{{quote|His [Gödel's] only idea at the time was that it might be possible, in terms of effective calculability as an undefined notion, to state a set of axioms which would embody the generally accepted properties of this notion, and to do something on that basis.&lt;ref name="sieg160"/&gt;}}

But Gödel offered no further guidance. Eventually, he would suggest his recursion, modified by Herbrand's suggestion, that Gödel had detailed in his 1934 lectures in Princeton NJ (Kleene and [[J. B. Rosser|Rosser]] transcribed the notes). But he did not think that the two ideas could be satisfactorily identified "except heuristically".&lt;ref&gt;Sieg 1997:160 quoting from the 1935 letter written by Church to Kleene, cf Footnote 3 in Gödel 1934 in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, it was necessary to identify and prove the equivalence of two notions of effective calculability. Equipped with the λ-calculus and "general" recursion, [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] with help of Church and [[J. Barkley Rosser]] produced proofs (1933, 1935) to show that the two calculi are equivalent. Church subsequently modified his methods to include use of Herbrand–Gödel recursion and then proved (1936) that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] is unsolvable: there is no generalized algorithm that can determine whether a [[well formed formula]] has a "normal form".&lt;ref&gt;cf. Church 1936 in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=105ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years later in a letter to Davis (c. 1965), Gödel said that "he was, at the time of these [1934] lectures, not at all convinced that his concept of recursion comprised all possible recursions".&lt;ref&gt;Davis's commentary before Gödel 1934 in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1963–64 Gödel would disavow Herbrand–Gödel recursion and the λ-calculus in favor of the Turing machine as the definition of "algorithm" or "mechanical procedure" or "formal system".&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed discussion of Gödel's adoption of Turing's machines as models of computation, see {{cite web |author=Shagrir |date= |url=http://moon.cc.huji.ac.il/oron-shagrir/papers/Goedel_on_Turing_on_Computability.pdf |format=PDF |title=Goedel on Turing on Computability |accessdate=2016-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151217145831/http://moon.cc.huji.ac.il/oron-shagrir/papers/Goedel_on_Turing_on_Computability.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-17 }}{{date missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A hypothesis leading to a natural law?''': In late 1936 [[Alan Turing]]'s paper (also proving that the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] is unsolvable) was delivered orally, but had not yet appeared in print.&lt;ref name="On Computable"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Emil Post]]'s 1936 paper had appeared and was certified independent of Turing's work.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Editor's footnote to Post 1936 ''Finite Combinatory Process. Formulation I.'' at {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=289}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Post strongly disagreed with Church's "identification" of effective computability with the λ-calculus and recursion, stating:

{{quote|Actually the work already done by Church and others carries this identification considerably beyond the working hypothesis stage. But to mask this identification under a definition… blinds us to the need of its continual verification.&lt;ref&gt;Post 1936 in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=291}}, footnote 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rather, he regarded the notion of "effective calculability" as merely a "working hypothesis" that might lead by [[inductive reasoning]] to a "[[natural law]]" rather than by "a definition or an axiom".&lt;ref&gt;Post 1936 in Davis 1952:291.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was "sharply" criticized by Church.&lt;ref&gt;Sieg 1997:171 and 176–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus Post in his 1936 paper was also discounting [[Kurt Gödel]]'s suggestion to Church in 1934–35 that the thesis might be expressed as an axiom or set of axioms.&lt;ref name="sieg160"&gt;Sieg 1997:160.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turing adds another definition, Rosser equates all three''': Within just a short time, Turing's 1936–37 paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"&lt;ref name="On Computable"/&gt; appeared. In it he stated another notion of "effective computability" with the introduction of his a-machines (now known as the [[Turing machine]] abstract computational model). And in a proof-sketch added as an "Appendix" to his 1936–37 paper, Turing showed that the classes of functions defined by λ-calculus and Turing machines coincided.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936–37 in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=263ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Church was quick to recognise how compelling Turing's analysis was. In his review of Turing's paper he made clear that Turing's notion made "the identification with effectiveness in the ordinary (not explicitly defined) sense evident immediately".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Church|1937}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few years (1939) Turing would propose, like Church and Kleene before him, that ''his'' formal definition of mechanical computing agent was the correct one.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1939 in Davis:160.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, by 1939, both Church (1934) and Turing (1939) had individually proposed that their "formal systems" should be ''definitions'' of "effective calculability";&lt;ref&gt;cf. Church 1934 in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=100}}, also Turing 1939 in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=160}}.&lt;/ref&gt; neither framed their statements as ''theses''.

Rosser (1939) formally identified the three notions-as-definitions:

{{quote|All three ''definitions'' are equivalent, so it does not matter which one is used.&lt;ref&gt;italics added, {{harvnb|Rosser|1939}} in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=226}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Kleene proposes ''Church's Thesis''''': This left the overt expression of a "thesis" to Kleene. In his 1943 paper ''Recursive Predicates and Quantifiers'' Kleene proposed his "THESIS I":

{{quote|This heuristic fact [general recursive functions are effectively calculable]&amp;nbsp;... led Church to state the following thesis(&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;). The same thesis is implicit in Turing's description of computing machines(&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;).
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none;|THESIS I. ''Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general&lt;ref&gt;An archaic usage of Kleene et al. to distinguish Gödel's (1931) "rekursiv" (a few years later named [[primitive recursion]] by [[Rózsa Péter]] (cf {{harvcolnb|Gandy|1994|p=68}})) from Herbrand–Gödel's recursion of 1934 i.e. primitive recursion equipped with the additional [[mu operator]]; nowadays mu-recursion is called, simply, "[[recursion]]".&lt;/ref&gt; recursive'' [Kleene's italics]}}
Since a precise mathematical definition of the term effectively calculable (effectively decidable) has been wanting, we can take this thesis&amp;nbsp;... as a definition of it&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name="Davis274"&gt;{{harvnb|Kleene|1943}} in {{harvcolnb|Davis|1965|p=274}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
(&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;) references Church 1936;{{nonspecific|date=November 2017}} (&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;) references Turing 1936–7
Kleene goes on to note that:

{{quote|the thesis has the character of an hypothesis—a point emphasized by Post and by Church(&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;). If we consider the thesis and its converse as definition, then the hypothesis is an hypothesis about the application of the mathematical theory developed from the definition. For the acceptance of the hypothesis, there are, as we have suggested, quite compelling grounds.&lt;ref name="Davis274" /&gt;}}

'''Kleene's Church–Turing Thesis''': A few years later (1952) Kleene, who switched from presenting his work in the mathematical terminology of the lambda calculus of his phd advisor Alonzo Church to the theory of general recursive functions of his other teacher Kurt Gödel, would overtly name the Church–Turing thesis in his correction of Turing's paper "The Word Problem in Semi-Groups with Cancellation",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Kleene|1952|pp=382,536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; defend, and express the two "theses" and then "identify" them (show equivalence) by use of his Theorem XXX:

{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none|Thesis I. ''Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Kleene|1952|p=300}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Theorem XXX: The following classes of partial functions are coextensive, i.e. have the same members: (a) the partial recursive functions, (b) the computable functions&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref name=Kleene_1952_p376&gt;{{harvcolnb|Kleene|1952|p=376}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's thesis: Turing's thesis that every function which would naturally be regarded as computable is computable under his definition, i.e. by one of his machines, is equivalent to Church's thesis by Theorem XXX.&lt;ref name=Kleene_1952_p376/&gt;}}

=== Later developments ===
An attempt to understand the notion of "effective computability" better led [[Robin Gandy]] (Turing's student and friend) in 1980 to analyze ''machine'' computation (as opposed to human-computation acted out by a Turing machine). Gandy's curiosity about, and analysis of, [[cellular automata]] (including [[Conway's game of life]]), parallelism, and crystalline automata, led him to propose four "principles (or constraints)&amp;nbsp;... which it is argued, any machine must satisfy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Gandy|1980|p=123ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His most-important fourth, "the principle of causality" is based on the "finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals; contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Gandy|1980|p=135}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From these principles and some additional constraints—(1a) a lower bound on the linear dimensions of any of the parts, (1b) an upper bound on speed of propagation (the velocity of light), (2) discrete progress of the machine, and (3) deterministic behavior—he produces a theorem that "What can be calculated by a device satisfying principles I–IV is computable."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Gandy|1980|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s [[Wilfried Sieg]] analyzed Turing's and Gandy's notions of "effective calculability" with the intent of "sharpening the informal notion, formulating its general features axiomatically, and investigating the axiomatic framework".&lt;ref&gt;Sieg 1998–9 in {{harvcolnb|Sieg|Somner|Talcott|2002|p=390ff}}; also Sieg 1997:154ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1997 and 2002 work Sieg presents a series of constraints on the behavior of a ''computor''—"a human computing agent who proceeds mechanically". These constraints reduce to:
*"(B.1) (Boundedness) There is a fixed bound on the number of symbolic configurations a computor can immediately recognize.
*"(B.2) (Boundedness) There is a fixed bound on the number of internal states a computor can be in.
*"(L.1) (Locality) A computor can change only elements of an observed symbolic configuration.
*"(L.2) (Locality) A computor can shift attention from one symbolic configuration to another one, but the new observed configurations must be within a bounded distance of the immediately previously observed configuration.
*"(D) (Determinacy) The immediately recognizable (sub-)configuration determines uniquely the next computation step (and id [instantaneous description])"; stated another way: "A computor's internal state together with the observed configuration fixes uniquely the next computation step and the next internal state."&lt;ref&gt;In a footnote Sieg breaks Post's 1936 (B) into (B.1) and (B.2) and (L) into (L.1) and (L.2) and describes (D) differently. With respect to his proposed [[Gandy machine]] he later adds LC.1, LC.2, GA.1 and GA.2. These are complicated; see Sieg 1998–99 in {{harvcolnb|Sieg|Somner|Talcott|2002|p=390ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter remains in active discussion within the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;A collection of papers can be found in {{harvtxt|Olszewski|Woleński|Janusz|2006}}. Also a review of this collection: {{cite web |first=Peter |last=Smith |date=July 11, 2007 |title=Church's Thesis after 70 Years |url=http://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/CTT.pdf |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite web|url=http://www.turing.org.uk/publications/ct70.pdf |title=Did Church and Turing Have a Thesis about Machines? |last=Hodges |first=Andrew |date=2005 |accessdate=July 27, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RNqzzUDI?url=http://www.turing.org.uk/publications/ct70.pdf |archivedate=July 27, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The thesis as a definition ===
The thesis can be viewed as nothing but an ordinary mathematical definition. Comments by Gödel on the subject suggest this view, e.g. "the correct definition of mechanical computability was established beyond any doubt by Turing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gödel |first=Kurt |author-link=Kurt Gödel |orig-year=193? |section=Undecidable Diophantine Propositions |section-url={{google books|gDzbuUwma5MC|page=164|plainurl=yes}} |title=Collected Works |url={{google books|gDzbuUwma5MC|plainurl=yes}} |volume=3 |page=[{{google books|gDzbuUwma5MC|page=168|plainurl=yes}} 168] |editor-last=Feferman |editor-first=Solomon |editor-link=Solomon Feferman |publication-date=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-507255-3 |oclc=928791907 |via=Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case for viewing the thesis as nothing more than a definition is made explicitly by [[Robert I. Soare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert I. |last=Soare |author-link=Robert I. Soare |date=September 1996 |title=Computability and Recursion |journal=Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=284–321 |doi=10.2307/420992 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/bulletin-of-symbolic-logic/article/computability-and-recursion/21DB3D692FCB1FFD2BE365C0B4A04FD6 |url-access=subscription }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is also argued that Turing's definition of computability is no less likely to be correct than the epsilon-delta definition of a [[continuous function]].

==Success of the thesis==
Other formalisms (besides recursion, the [[Lambda calculus|λ-calculus]], and the [[Turing machine]]) have been proposed for describing effective calculability/computability. [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]] (1952) adds to the list the functions "''reckonable'' in the system S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;" of [[Kurt Gödel]] 1936, and [[Emil Post]]'s (1943, 1946) "''canonical'' [also called ''normal''] ''systems''".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:320&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] and [[Martin Davis]] greatly simplified the one-tape Turing-machine model (see [[Post–Turing machine]]). [[Marvin Minsky]] expanded the model to two or more tapes and greatly simplified the tapes into "up-down counters", which Melzak and [[Joachim Lambek|Lambek]] further evolved into what is now known as the [[counter machine]] model. In the late 1960s and early 1970s researchers expanded the counter machine model into the [[register machine]], a close cousin to the modern notion of the [[computer]]. Other models include [[combinatory logic]] and [[Markov algorithm]]s. Gurevich adds the [[pointer machine]] model of Kolmogorov and Uspensky (1953, 1958): "...&amp;nbsp;they just wanted to&amp;nbsp;... convince themselves that there is no way to extend the notion of computable function."&lt;ref&gt;Gurevich 1988:2&lt;/ref&gt;

All these contributions involve proofs that the models are computationally equivalent to the Turing machine; such models are said to be [[Turing complete]]. Because all these different attempts at formalizing the concept of "effective calculability/computability" have yielded equivalent results, it is now generally assumed that the Church–Turing thesis is correct. In fact, Gödel (1936) proposed something stronger than this; he observed that there was something "absolute" about the concept of "reckonable in S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;":

{{quote|It may also be shown that a function which is computable ['reckonable'] in one of the systems S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, or even in a system of transfinite type, is already computable [reckonable] in S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus the concept 'computable' ['reckonable'] is in a certain definite sense 'absolute', while practically all other familiar metamathematical concepts (e.g. provable, definable, etc.) depend quite essentially on the system to which they are defined&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;translation of Gödel (1936) by Davis in ''The Undecidable'' p. 83, differing in the use of the word 'reckonable' in the translation in Kleene (1952) p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;!--

In the early twentieth century, mathematicians often used the informal phrase ''effectively computable'', so it was important to find a good formalization of the concept. Modern mathematicians instead use the well-defined term ''Turing computable'' (or ''computable'' for short). Since the undefined terminology has faded from use, the question of how to define it is now less important.--&gt;

== Informal usage in proofs ==

Proofs in computability theory often invoke the Church–Turing thesis in an informal way to establish the computability of functions while avoiding the (often very long) details which would be involved in a rigorous, formal proof.&lt;ref&gt;Horsten in {{harvcolnb|Olszewski|2006|p=256}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To establish that a function is computable by Turing machine, it is usually considered sufficient to give an informal English description of how the function can be effectively computed, and then conclude "by the Church–Turing thesis" that the function is Turing computable (equivalently, partial recursive).

Dirk van Dalen gives the following example for the sake of illustrating this informal use of the Church–Turing thesis:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcolnb|Gabbay|2001|p=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1=EXAMPLE: Each infinite [[recursively enumerable|RE]] set contains an infinite [[recursive set]].

Proof: Let A be infinite RE. We list the elements of A effectively, n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ...

From this list we extract an increasing sublist: put m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=n&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, after finitely many steps we find an n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; such that n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, put m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=n&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. We repeat this procedure to find m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. this yields an effective listing of the subset B={m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,m&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...} of A, with the property m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; m&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt;.

''Claim''. B is decidable. For, in order to test k in B we must check if k=m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; for some i. Since the sequence of m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s is increasing we have to produce at most k+1 elements of the list and compare them with k. If none of them is equal to k, then k not in B. Since this test is effective, B is decidable and, '''by Church's thesis''', recursive.}}

In order to make the above example completely rigorous, one would have to carefully construct a Turing machine, or λ-function, or carefully invoke recursion axioms, or at best, cleverly invoke various theorems of computability theory. But because the computability theorist believes that Turing computability correctly captures what can be computed effectively, and because an effective procedure is spelled out in English for deciding the set B, the computability theorist accepts this as proof that the set is indeed recursive.

== Variations ==
The success of the Church–Turing thesis prompted variations of the thesis to be proposed. For example, the '''physical Church–Turing thesis''' states: "All physically computable functions are Turing-computable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-link=Gualtiero Piccinini |last=Piccinini |first=Gualtiero |date=January 2007 |url=http://www.umsl.edu/~piccininig/Computationalism_Church-Turing_Thesis_Church-Turing_Fallacy.pdf |format=PDF |title=Computationalism, the Church–Turing Thesis, and the Church–Turing Fallacy |doi=10.1007/s11229-005-0194-z |journal=Synthese |volume=154 |issue=1 |pages=97–120 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}}

{{anchor|complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis}}The Church–Turing thesis says nothing about the efficiency with which one model of computation can simulate another. It has been proved for instance that a (multi-tape) [[universal Turing machine]] only suffers a logarithmic slowdown factor in simulating any Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arora |first1=Sanjeev |last2=Barak |first2=Boaz |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/theory/complexity/ |title=Complexity Theory: A Modern Approach |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-42426-4 }} Sections 1.4, "Machines as strings and the universal Turing machine" and 1.7, "Proof of theorem 1.9".&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation of the Church–Turing thesis addresses whether an arbitrary but "reasonable" model of computation can be efficiently simulated. This is called the '''feasibility thesis''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Official Problem Description |url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/Official_Problem_Description.pdf |archive-date=November 24, 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051124084833/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/Official_Problem_Description.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the ('''classical''') '''complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis''' or the '''extended Church–Turing thesis''', which is not due to Church or Turing, but rather was realized gradually in the development of [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]]. It states:&lt;ref name=kaye&gt;{{cite book |first1=Phillip |last1=Kaye |first2=Raymond |last2=Laflamme |first3=Michele |last3=Mosca |title=An introduction to quantum computing |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2007 |isbn=0-19-857049-X |pages=5–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "A [[probabilistic Turing machine]] can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation." The word 'efficiently' here means up to [[polynomial-time reduction]]s. This thesis was originally called '''computational complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis''' by Ethan Bernstein and [[Umesh Vazirani]] (1997). The complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis, then, posits that all 'reasonable' models of computation yield the same class of problems that can be computed in polynomial time. Assuming the conjecture that probabilistic polynomial time ([[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]) equals deterministic polynomial time ([[P (complexity)|P]]), the word 'probabilistic' is optional in the complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis. A similar thesis, called the '''invariance thesis''', was introduced by Cees F. Slot and Peter van Emde Boas. It states: {{"'}}Reasonable' machines can simulate each other within a polynomially bounded overhead in time and a constant-factor overhead in space."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter |last=van Emde Boas |chapter=Machine Models and Simulations |title=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science A |publisher=Elsevier |date=1990 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis originally appeared in a paper at [[STOC]]'84, which was the first paper to show that polynomial-time overhead and constant-space overhead could be ''simultaneously'' achieved for a simulation of a [[Random Access Machine]] on a Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=C. |last1=Slot |first2=P. |last2=van Emde Boas |title=On tape versus core: an application of space efficient perfect hash functions to the invariance of space |conference=[[STOC]] |date=December 1984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If [[BQP]] is shown to be a strict superset of [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]], it would invalidate the complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis. In other words, there would be efficient [[quantum algorithms]] that perform tasks that do not have efficient [[probabilistic algorithms]]. This would not however invalidate the original Church–Turing thesis, since a quantum computer can always be simulated by a Turing machine, but it would invalidate the classical complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis for efficiency reasons. Consequently, the '''quantum complexity-theoretic Church–Turing thesis''' states:&lt;ref name=kaye/&gt; "A [[quantum Turing machine]] can efficiently simulate any realistic model of computation."

Eugene Eberbach and Peter Wegner claim that the Church–Turing thesis is sometimes interpreted too broadly,
stating "the broader assertion that algorithms precisely capture what can be computed is invalid".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eberbach|Wegner|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} They claim that forms of computation not captured by the thesis are relevant today,
terms which they call [[hypercomputation|super-Turing computation]].

==Philosophical implications==
Philosophers have interpreted the Church–Turing thesis as having implications for the [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SEP |last=Copeland |first=B. Jack |author-link=Jack Copeland |date=November 10, 2017 |title=The Church-Turing Thesis |url-id=church-turing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a good place to encounter original papers see {{cite book |editor-first=David J. |editor-last=Chalmers |editor-link=David Chalmers |date=2002 |title=Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-514581-X |oclc=610918145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Copeland|B. Jack Copeland]] states that it is an open empirical question whether there are actual deterministic physical processes that, in the long run, elude simulation by a Turing machine; furthermore, he states that it is an open empirical question whether any such processes are involved in the working of the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=B. Jack |last=Copeland |author-link=Jack Copeland |section=Computation |editor-first=Luciano |editor-last=Floridi |editor-link=Luciano Floridi |title=The Blackwell guide to the philosophy of computing and information |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=2004 |isbn=0-631-22919-1 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also some important open questions which cover the relationship between the Church–Turing thesis and physics, and the possibility of [[hypercomputation]]. When applied to physics, the thesis has several possible meanings:

#The universe is equivalent to a Turing machine; thus, computing [[recursion (computer science)|non-recursive functions]] is physically impossible. This has been termed the strong Church–Turing thesis, or [[Church–Turing–Deutsch principle]], and is a foundation of [[digital physics]].
#The universe is not equivalent to a Turing machine (i.e., the laws of physics are not Turing-computable), but incomputable physical events are not "harnessable" for the construction of a [[hypercomputation|hypercomputer]]. For example, a universe in which physics involves random [[real numbers]], as opposed to [[computable number|computable real]]s, would fall into this category.
#The universe is a [[hypercomputation|hypercomputer]], and it is possible to build physical devices to harness this property and calculate non-recursive functions. For example, it is an open question whether all [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] events are Turing-computable, although it is known that rigorous models such as quantum Turing machines are equivalent to deterministic Turing machines. (They are not necessarily efficiently equivalent; see above.) [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] and [[Roger Penrose]] have suggested that the human mind might be the result of some kind of quantum-mechanically enhanced, "non-algorithmic" computation.&lt;ref&gt;cf {{cite book |last=Penrose |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Penrose |date=1990 |chapter=Algorithms and Turing machines &lt;!--|section=The Church–Turing Thesis--&gt; |pages=47–49 |title=[[The Emperor's New Mind|The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |oclc=456785846 |isbn=0-19-851973-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also the description of "the non-algorithmic nature of mathematical insight", {{cite book |last=Penrose |first=Roger |author-link=Roger Penrose |date=1990 |chapter=Where lies the physics of mind? |pages=416–418 |title=[[The Emperor's New Mind|The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |oclc=456785846 |isbn=0-19-851973-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many other technical possibilities which fall outside or between these three categories, but these serve to illustrate the range of the concept.

== Non-computable functions ==
{{One source section|date=November 2017}}
One can formally define functions that are not computable. A well-known example of such a function is the [[Busy Beaver]] function. This function takes an input ''n'' and returns the largest number of symbols that a [[Turing machine]] with ''n'' states can print before halting, when run with no input. Finding an upper bound on the busy beaver function is equivalent to solving the [[halting problem]], a problem known to be unsolvable by Turing machines. Since the busy beaver function cannot be computed by Turing machines, the Church–Turing thesis states that this function cannot be effectively computed by any method.

Several computational models allow for the computation of (Church-Turing) non-computable functions. These are known as
[[hypercomputation|hypercomputers]].
Mark Burgin argues that [[super-recursive algorithm]]s such as inductive Turing machines disprove the Church–Turing thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgin |first=Mark |date=2005 |title=Super-Recursive Algorithms |series=Monographs in Computer Science |publisher=Springer |location=New York |isbn=0-387-95569-0 |oclc=990755791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} His argument relies on a definition of algorithm broader than the ordinary one, so that non-computable functions obtained from some inductive Turing machines are called computable. This interpretation of the Church–Turing thesis differs from the interpretation commonly accepted in computability theory, discussed above. The argument that super-recursive algorithms are indeed algorithms in the sense of the Church–Turing thesis has not found broad acceptance within the computability research community.

The '''clathrate gun hypothesis''' is the popular name given to the idea that increases in sea temperatures or drops in sea levels can trigger a strong [[positive feedback]] effect on climate: first, warming causes a sudden release of [[methane]] from [[methane clathrate]] compounds buried in [[seabed]]s and seabed [[permafrost]]; second, because methane itself is a powerful [[greenhouse gas]], temperatures rise further, and the cycle repeats.  This runaway process, once started, could be as irreversible as the firing of a gun.&lt;ref name="Kennett 2003"&gt;{{cite book |first1=James P. |last1=Kennett |first2=Kevin G. |last2=Cannariato |first3=Ingrid L. |last3=Hendy |first4=Richard J. |last4=Behl |year=2003 |title=Methane Hydrates in Quaternary Climate Change: The Clathrate Gun Hypothesis |publisher=[[American Geophysical Union]] |location=Washington DC |isbn=978-0-87590-296-8 |doi=10.1029/054SP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its original form, the hypothesis proposed that the "[[Clathrate compound|clathrate]] gun" could cause abrupt runaway warming on a time scale less than a human lifetime.&lt;ref name="Kennett 2003" /&gt; A 2018 published review concluded that the clathrate gun hypothesis remains controversial, but that better understanding is vital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Methane and Global Environmental Change|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-030154|year=2018|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|volume=43|pages=165–192|last1 = Reay|first1 = Dave S.|last2=Smith|first2=Pete|last3=Christensen|first3=Torben R.|last4=James|first4=Rachael H.|last5=Clark|first5=Harry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
Studies published in 2000 attributed the hypothesis to be responsible for warming events in and at the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kennett |first1=James P. |last2=Cannariato |first2=Kevin G. |last3=Hendy |first3=Ingrid L. |last4=Behl |first4=Richard J. |date=7 April 2000 |title=Carbon Isotopic Evidence for Methane Hydrate Instability During Quaternary Interstadials |journal=[[Science (magazine)|Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.288.5463.128 |bibcode=2000Sci...288..128K |volume=288 |issue=5463 |pages=128–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is now thought to be unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sowers |first=Todd |date=10 February 2006 |title=Late Quaternary Atmospheric {{chem|CH|4}} Isotope Record Suggests Marine Clathrates Are Stable |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.1121235 |pmid=16469923 |bibcode=2006Sci...311..838S |volume=311 |issue=5762 |pages=838–840}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Severinghaus |first1=Jeffrey P. |last2=Whiticar |first2=MJ |last3=Brook |first3=EJ |last4=Petrenko |first4=VV |last5=Ferretti |first5=DF |last6=Severinghaus |first6=JP |date=25 August 2006 |title=Ice Record of {{chem|13|C}} for Atmospheric {{chem|CH|4}} Across the Younger Dryas-Preboreal Transition |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.1126562 |pmid=16931759 |bibcode=2006Sci...313.1109S |volume=313 |issue=5790 |pages=1109–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At one point there seemed to be stronger evidence that runaway methane clathrate breakdown may have caused drastic alteration of the ocean environment (such as [[ocean acidification]] and [[Stratification (water)|ocean stratification]]) and of the atmosphere over timescales of tens of thousands of years during the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] 56 million years ago, and most notably the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]], when up to 96% of all marine species became extinct, 252 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |others=Narrated by Jack Fortune |date=5 December 2002 |title=The Day The Earth Nearly Died |series=Horizon |serieslink=Horizon (BBC TV series) |network=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2002/dayearthdied.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Erwin1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Erwin DH|year=1993|title=The great Paleozoic crisis; Life and death in the Permian|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-07467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the pattern of isotope shifts expected to result from a massive release of methane does not match the patterns seen there. First, the isotope shift is too large for this hypothesis, as it would require five times as much methane as is postulated for the PETM,&lt;ref name=Payne2004&gt;Payne, J.L., Lehrmann, D.J., Wei, J., Orchard, M.J., Schrag, D.P. and Knoll, A.H., 2004.

===Possible release events===
Two events possibly linked to methane excursions are the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] and the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]] (PETM). Equatorial permafrost methane clathrate may have had a role in the sudden warm-up of "[[Snowball Earth]]", 630 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kennedy |first1=Martin |last2=Mrofka |first2=David |last3=Von Der Borch |first3=Chris |year=2008 |title=Snowball Earth termination by destabilization of equatorial permafrost methane clathrate |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature06961 |pmid=18509441 |bibcode=2008Natur.453..642K |volume=453 |issue=7195 |pages=642–645 |url=http://faculty.ucr.edu/~martink/pdfs/Kennedy_2008_Nature.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, warming at the end of the [[last glacial period|last ice age]] is not thought to be due to methane release.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} A similar event is the methane hydrate releases, following ice-sheet retreat during the [[last glacial period]], around 12,000 years ago, in response to the [[Bølling-Allerød warming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/06/01/like-champagne-bottles-being-opened-scientists-document-an-ancient-arctic-methane-explosion|title=Like 'champagne bottles being opened': Scientists document an ancient Arctic methane explosion|publisher=The Washington Post|date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=PNAS|volume=114|issue=24|pages=6215–6220|year=2017|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/24/6215|title=Postglacial response of Arctic Ocean gas hydrates to climatic amelioration|authors=Serov et al.|doi=10.1073/pnas.1619288114|pmid=28584081|pmc=5474808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methane clathrate, also known commonly as methane [[hydrate]], is a form of water ice that contains a large amount of methane within its crystal structure. Potentially large deposits of methane clathrate have been found under sediments on the ocean floors of the Earth, although the estimates of total resource size given by various experts differ by many orders of magnitude, leaving doubt as to the size of methane clathrate deposits (particularly in the viability of extracting them as a fuel resource). Indeed, cores of greater than 10&amp;nbsp;centimeters' contiguous depth had only been found in three sites as of 2000, and some resource reserve size estimates for specific deposits/locations have been based primarily on seismology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collet |first1=Timothy S. |last2=Kuuskraa |first2=Vello A. |year=1998 |title=Hydrates contain vast store of world gas resources |journal=[[Oil and Gas Journal]] |volume=96 |issue=19 |pages=90–95 |url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-96/issue-19/in-this-issue/exploration/hydrates-contain-vast-store-of-world-gas-resources.html |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Jean |last=Laherrere |date=May 3, 2000 |title=Oceanic Hydrates: More Questions Than Answers |journal=Energy Exploration &amp; Exploitation |volume=18 |pages=349–383 |issn=0144-5987 |doi=10.1260/0144598001492175 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sudden release of large amounts of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits in [[runaway climate change]] could be a cause of past, future, and present climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; some have suggested that this was a main factor in the planet warming 6&amp;nbsp;°C, which happened during the end-Permian extinction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Michael J. |last2=Twitchet |first2=Richard J. |date=July 2003 |title = How to kill (almost) all life: the end-Permian extinction event |journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |doi = 10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00093-4 |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=358–365 |url=http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Benton/reprints/2003TREEPTr.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Despite its atmospheric lifetime of around 12 years, it has a [[global warming potential]] of 72 over 20 years, 25 over 100 years, and 33 when accounted for [[aerosol]] interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shindell |first1=Drew T. |last2=Faluvegi |first2=Greg |last3=Koch |first3=Dorothy M. |last4=Schmidt |first4=Gavin A. |last5=Unger |first5=Nadine |last6=Bauer |first6=Susanne E. |year=2009 |title=Improved attribution of climate forcing to emissions |journal=Science |doi=10.1126/science.1174760 |pmid=19900930 |bibcode=2009Sci...326..716S |volume=326 |issue=5953 |pages=716–718}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen and [[hydroxyl radical]] content of the atmosphere.

=== Subsea permafrost ===
{{Main|Permafrost}}
Subsea permafrost occurs beneath the seabed and exists in the [[continental shelves]] of the polar regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=IPCC AR4 |date=2007 |title=Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch4s4-7-2-4.html |accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This source of methane is different from methane clathrates, but contributes to the overall outcome and feedbacks.

From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from subsea permafrost into the ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100–630&amp;nbsp;mg methane per square meter is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, when wind accelerates air-sea gas exchange, methane levels in the water column drop dramatically. Observations suggest that methane release from seabed permafrost will progress slowly, rather than abruptly. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by [[global warming]], and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more rapid methane release from this source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shakhova |first1=Natalia |last2=Semiletov |first2=Igor |last3=Leifer |first3=Ira |last4=Sergienko |first4=Valentin |last5=Salyuk |first5=Anatoly |last6=Kosmach |first6=Denis |last7=Chernykh |first7=Denis |last8=Stubbs |first8=Chris |last9=Nicolsky |first9=Dmitry |last10=Tumskoy |first10=Vladimir |last11=Gustafsson |first11=Örjan |date=November 24, 2013 |title=Ebullition and storm-induced methane release from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/ngeo2007 |bibcode=2014NatGe...7...64S |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=64–70 |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n1/full/ngeo2007.html |accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metastable methane clathrates===
Another kind of exception is in clathrates associated with the [[Arctic ocean]], where clathrates can exist in shallower water stabilized by lower temperatures rather than higher pressures; these may potentially be marginally stable much closer to the surface of the sea-bed, stabilized by a frozen 'lid' of [[permafrost]] preventing methane escape.

The so-called [[Self-preservation|self-preservation phenomenon]] has been studied by Russian geologists starting in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Istomin |first1=V.

=== Ocean anoxia ===
{{Main|Anoxic event}}
Euxinic (i.e. sulfidic) and anoxic events happened in the past on different time scales ranging from decades to centuries (from [[impact event]]s) or through climate change within tens of thousands of years or a few million years. According to Gregory Ryskin, such a scenario could lead to the release of methane and other gases (e.g., {{CO2}}, {{chem|H|2|S}}) into the atmosphere, from the ocean. Following [[atmospheric methane]] excursions he postulates explosions and burning of methane would produce lots of smoke and dust, which would first lead to [[global cooling]].&lt;ref name="Ryskin 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ryskin |first=Gregory |date=September 2003 |title=Methane-driven oceanic eruptions and mass extinctions |journal=Geology |doi=10.1130/G19518.1 |bibcode=2003Geo....31..741R |volume=31 |issue=9 |pages=741–744 |url=http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/31/9/741}}&lt;/ref&gt; And likely after a relatively short geological period following stratospheric cooling, [[global warming]] would take over.

{{Main|Climate change in the Arctic}}
Most deposits of methane clathrate are in sediments too deep to respond rapidly, and modelling by [[David Archer (scientist)|Archer]] (2007) suggests the methane forcing should remain a minor component of the overall [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref name="Archer2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Archer |first=D. |year=2007 |title=Methane hydrate stability and anthropogenic climate change |journal=Biogeosciences |doi=10.5194/bg-4-521-2007 |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=521–544 |url=http://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/reprints/archer.2007.hydrate_rev.pdf |format=PDF}} See also [http://www.realclimate.org/wp-trackback.php/227 blog summary].&lt;/ref&gt;  Clathrate deposits destabilize from the deepest part of their [[Gas hydrate stability zone|stability zone]], which is typically hundreds of metres below the seabed.  A sustained increase in sea temperature will warm its way through the sediment eventually, and cause the shallowest, most marginal clathrate to start to break down; but it will typically take on the order of a thousand years or more for the temperature signal to get through.&lt;ref name="Archer2007" /&gt;

Hong et al. 2017 studied methane seepage in the shallow arctic seas at the Barents Sea close to Svalbard. Temperature at the seabed has fluctuated seasonally over the last century, between -1.8 and 4.8&amp;nbsp;°C, it has only affected release of methane to a depth of about 1.6 meters at the sediment-water interface. Hydrates can be stable through the top 60 meters of the sediments and the current observed releases originate from deeper below the sea floor. They conclude that the increased methane flux started hundreds to thousands of years ago, noted about it, "..episodic ventilation of deep reservoirs rather than warming-induced gas hydrate dissociation."&lt;ref&gt;Hong, Wei-Li, et al.

==== Continental slopes ====
[[File:Continental shelf.png|thumb|Profile illustrating the continental shelf, slope and rise]]
A trapped gas deposit on the continental slope off Canada in the [[Beaufort Sea]], located in an area of small conical hills on the ocean floor is just 290 meters below sea level and considered the shallowest known deposit of methane hydrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Corbyn |first=Zoë |date=December 7, 2012 |title=Locked greenhouse gas in Arctic sea may be 'climate canary' |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature.2012.11988 |url=http://www.nature.com/news/locked-greenhouse-gas-in-arctic-sea-may-be-climate-canary-1.11988 |accessdate=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ESAS region averages 45 meters in depth, and it is assumed that below the seafloor, sealed by sub-sea permafrost layers, hydrates deposits are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skepticalscience.com/arctic-methane-outgassing-e-siberian-shelf-part1.html|title=Arctic methane outgassing on the E Siberian Shelf part 1 - the background|year=2012|work=SkepticalScience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seismology|Seismic]] observation in 2012 of destabilizing methane hydrate along the continental slope of the eastern United States, following the intrusion of warmer ocean currents, suggests that underwater landslides could release methane. The estimated amount of methane hydrate in this slope is 2.5 gigatonnes (about 0.2% of the amount required to cause the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum|PETM]]), and it is unclear if the methane could reach the atmosphere. However, the authors of the study caution: "It is unlikely that the western North Atlantic margin is the only area experiencing changing ocean currents; our estimate of 2.5 gigatonnes of destabilizing methane hydrate may therefore represent only a fraction of the methane hydrate currently destabilizing globally." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phrampus |first1=B.

[[Bill McGuire (volcanologist)|Bill McGuire]] notes, "There may be a threat of submarine landslides around the margins of [[Greenland]], which are less well explored. Greenland is already uplifting, reducing the pressure on the crust beneath and also on submarine methane hydrates in the sediment around its margins, and increased seismic activity may be apparent within decades as active faults beneath the ice sheet are unloaded. This could provide the potential for the earthquake or methane hydrate destabilisation of submarine sediment, leading to the formation of submarine slides and, perhaps, tsunamis in the North Atlantic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climatestate.com/2014/10/16/methane-hydrate-destabilisation-is-clearly-a-real-worry-particularly-in-the-context-of-warming-ocean-waters-in-the-east-siberian-continental-shelf|title=Bill McGuire: Modelling suggests with ice cap melt, an increase in volcanic activity|year=2014|work=ClimateState.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by Klaus Wallmann et al. 2018 concluded that hydrate dissociation at Svalbard 8,000 years ago was due to the rebound of the seabed following ice-sheet retreat. As a result the water depth got shallower with less hydrostatic pressure, without further warming. The study, also found that today's deposits at the site become unstable at a depth of ~ 400 meters, due to seasonal bottom water warming, and it remains unclear if this is due to natural variability or anthropogenic warming.&lt;ref name="Wallmann2018"/&gt;

== Model simulations ==
A study of the effects for the original hypothesis, based on a coupled climate–carbon cycle model ([[General Circulation Model|GCM]]) assessed a 1000-fold (from &lt;1 to 1000 ppmv) methane increase—within a single pulse, from methane hydrates (based on carbon amount estimates for the PETM, with ~2000 GtC), and concluded it would increase atmospheric temperatures by more than 6&amp;nbsp;°C within 80 years. Further, carbon stored in the land biosphere would decrease by less than 25%, suggesting a critical situation for ecosystems and farming, especially in the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Atsushi Obata |author2=Kiyotaka Shibata |date=June 20, 2012 |title=Damage of Land Biosphere due to Intense Warming by 1000-Fold Rapid Increase in Atmospheric Methane: Estimation with a Climate–Carbon Cycle Model |journal=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11708">'''Control reconfiguration''' is an active approach in [[control theory]] to achieve [[Fault-Tolerant Control|fault-tolerant control]] for [[dynamic systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Blanke|Kinnaert|Lunze|Staroswiecki|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used when severe [[Fault (technology)|faults]], such as actuator or sensor outages, cause a break-up of the [[control loop]], which must be restructured to prevent [[failure]] at the system level. In addition to loop restructuring, the [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] parameters must be adjusted to accommodate changed plant dynamics. Control reconfiguration is a building block toward increasing the [[dependability]] of systems under [[feedback]] control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Patton|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reconfiguration problem ==

[[Image:ReconfStructure.png|frame|Schematic diagram of a typical active fault-tolerant control system. In the nominal, i.e. fault-free situation, the lower control loop operates to meet the control goals. The fault-detection (FDI) module monitors the closed-loop system to detect and isolate faults. The fault estimate is passed to the reconfiguration block, which modifies the control loop to reach the control goals in spite of the fault.]]

=== Fault modelling ===

The figure to the right shows a plant controlled by a controller in a standard control loop.

The nominal linear model of the plant is

&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}} &amp; = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{u}\\
\mathbf{y} &amp; = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{x}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The plant subject to a fault (indicated by a red arrow in the figure) is modelled in general by

&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}}_f &amp; = \mathbf{A}_f\mathbf{x}_f + \mathbf{B}_f\mathbf{u}\\
\mathbf{y}_f &amp; = \mathbf{C}_f\mathbf{x}_f\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the system is faulty. This approach models multiplicative faults by modified system matrices. Specifically, actuator faults are represented by the new input matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}_f&lt;/math&gt;, sensor faults are represented by the output map &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{C}_f&lt;/math&gt;, and internal plant faults are represented by the system matrix &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}_f&lt;/math&gt;.

The upper part of the figure shows a supervisory loop consisting of ''fault detection and isolation'' (FDI) and ''reconfiguration'' which changes the loop by

# choosing new input and output signals from {&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;} to reach the control goal,
# changing the controller internals (including dynamic structure and parameters),
# adjusting the reference input &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt;.

To this end, the vectors of inputs and outputs contain ''all available signals'', not just those used by the controller in fault-free operation.

Alternative scenarios can model faults as an additive external signal &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}&lt;/math&gt; influencing the state derivatives and outputs as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}\dot{\mathbf{x}}_f &amp; = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}_f + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{E}\mathbf{f}\\
\mathbf{y}_f &amp; = \mathbf{C}_f\mathbf{x}_f + \mathbf{F}\mathbf{f}\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Reconfiguration goals ===

The goal of reconfiguration is to keep the reconfigured control-loop performance sufficient for preventing plant shutdown. The following goals are distinguished:

# Stabilization
# Equilibrium recovery
# Output trajectory recovery
# State trajectory recovery
# Transient time response recovery

Internal stability of the reconfigured closed loop is usually the minimum requirement. The equilibrium recovery goal (also referred to as weak goal) refers to the steady-state output equilibrium which the reconfigured loop reaches after a given constant input. This equilibrium must equal the nominal equilibrium under the same input (as time tends to infinity). This goal ensures steady-state reference tracking after reconfiguration. The output trajectory recovery goal (also referred to as strong goal) is even stricter. It requires that the dynamic response to an input must equal the nominal response at all times. Further restrictions are imposed by the state trajectory recovery goal, which requires that the state trajectory be restored to the nominal case by the reconfiguration under any input.

Usually a combination of goals is pursued in practice, such as the equilibrium-recovery goal with stability.

The question whether or not these or similar goals can be reached for specific faults is addressed by [[reconfigurability]] analysis.

== Reconfiguration approaches ==

=== Fault hiding ===
[[Image:FaultHiding with Goals.png|frame|Fault hiding principle. A reconfiguration block is placed between faulty plant and nominal controller. The reconfuigured plant behaviour must match the nominal behaviour. Furthermore, the reconfiguration goals are pointed out.]]
This paradigm aims at keeping the nominal controller in the loop. To this end, a reconfiguration block can be placed between the faulty plant and the nominal controller. Together with the faulty plant, it forms the reconfigured plant. The reconfiguration block has to fulfill the requirement that the behaviour of the reconfigured plant matches the behaviour of the nominal, that is fault-free plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Steffen|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Linear model following ===
In linear model following, a formal feature of the nominal closed loop is attempted to be recovered. In the classical pseudo-inverse method, the closed loop system matrix &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{A}} = \mathbf{A}-\mathbf{B}\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; of a state-feedback control structure is used. The new controller &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}_f&lt;/math&gt; is found to approximate &lt;math&gt;\bar{\mathbf{A}}&lt;/math&gt; in the sense of an induced matrix norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Gao|Antsaklis|1991}} {{Harv|Staroswiecki|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In perfect model following, a dynamic compensator is introduced to allow for the exact recovery of the complete loop behaviour under certain conditions.

In eigenstructure assignment, the nominal closed loop eigenvalues and eigenvectors (the eigenstructure) is recovered to the nominal case after a fault.

=== Optimisation-based control schemes ===
Optimisation control schemes include: linear-quadratic regulator design (LQR), model predictive control (MPC) and eigenstructure assignment methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Looze|Weiss|Eterno|Barrett|1985}}{{Harv|Lunze|Rowe-Serrano|Steffen|2003}}{{Harv|Esna Ashari|Khaki Sedigh|Yazdanpanah|2005}}{{Harv|Maciejowski|Jones|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probabilistic approaches ===
Some probabilistic approaches have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Mahmoud|Jiang|Zhang|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning control ===
There are learning automata, neural networks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Rauch|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical tools and frameworks ==
The methods by which reconfiguration is achieved differ considerably. The following list gives an overview of mathematical approaches that are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Zhang|Jiang|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Adaptive control]] (AC)
* Disturbance decoupling (DD)
* Eigenstructure assignment (EA)
* [[Gain scheduling]] (GS)/linear parameter varying (LPV)
* Generalised internal model control (GIMC)
* Intelligent control (IC)
* [[Linear matrix inequality]] (LMI)
* [[Linear-quadratic regulator]] (LQR)
* Model following (MF)
* [[Model predictive control]] (MPC)
* [[Pseudoinverse|Pseudo-inverse]] method (PIM)
* [[Robust control]] techniques

== See also ==
Prior to control reconfiguration, it must be at least determined whether a fault has occurred ([[fault detection]]) and if so, which components are affected ([[fault isolation]]). Preferably, a model of the faulty plant should be provided ([[Fault Identification|fault identification]]). These questions are addressed by [[fault diagnosis]] methods.

[[Fault Accommodation|Fault accommodation]] is another common approach to achieve [[Fault Tolerance|fault tolerance]]. In contrast to control reconfiguration, accommodation is limited to internal controller changes. The sets of signals manipulated and measured by the controller are fixed, which means that the loop cannot be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Blanke|Kinnaert|Lunze|Staroswiecki|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Drexel University College of Computing &amp; Informatics''', formerly the '''College of Information Science and Technology''' or '''iSchool''', is one of the primary colleges of [[Drexel University]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].  The College of Computing &amp; Informatics has faculty and administrative offices, research laboratories, and outreach centers in several locations including the Rush Building (Drexel University main campus; University Crossings (Drexel University main campus); 3401 Market Street (Drexel University main campus); One Drexel Plaza (Drexel University main campus); Monell Chemical Senses Center (Drexel University main campus); and the Drexel University Washington, D.C. Office.

The CCI was formed in September 2013 by merging the former College of Information Science and Technology (iSchool), the Department of Computer Science, and the Department of Computing and Security Technology. It is part of the [[List of information schools|iSchools Caucus]]. In fact the College of Information Science and Technology was one of the first three founding members that formed the iSchool Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ischools.org/about/history/origins/|title=Origins|work=ischools.org|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
CCI was created in 2013 as a result of merging the former College of Information Science and Technology (iSchool), the Department of Computer Science, and the Department of Computing and Security Technology. Details regarding the history of the iSchool is below:

===College of Information Science and Technology (iSchool)===
* College of Computing and Informatics ( 2013–Present)
* 1995-2013   College of Information Science and Technology 
* 1985-1995   College of Information Studies
* 1979-1985   School of Library and Information Science
* 1942-1979   Graduate School of Library Science
* 1922-1942   School of Library Science
* 1900-1914   Library School
* 1893-1900   Library Dept.
* 1892-1893   Library and Reading Room &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.library.drexel.edu/colleges|title=Drexel's colleges and schools, 1891 - present|work=drexel.edu|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===Undergraduate===
The College of Computing &amp; Informatics offers six undergraduate programs: the Bachelor of Science in Information Systems (BSIS), Informatics (BSI), Information Technology (BSIT), Software Engineering (BSSE), Computing and Security Technology, [[Computer science|Computer Science (CS)]], and the BS/MS Accelerated Degree Program which allows students to complete both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in five years. Most of the undergraduates take advantage of Drexel's [[Drexel University#Co-op program|long-standing co-op program]] to get real-world work experience before graduation.&lt;ref name="cci.drexel.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drexel University College of Computing &amp; Informatics|url=http://cci.drexel.edu/|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college also has a Peer Mentor program through which incoming undergraduate students are assigned mentors who are current students in CCI programs. Any student can apply to be a Peer Mentor after their first year and be interviewed for selection.

===Graduate===
The college offers master's programs including the Master of Science (MS) in Library and Information Science, the Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS), the Master of Science in Software Engineering (MSSE), the Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS), the online Master of Science in Health Informatics (MSHI), the Master of Science in National Security Management (MSNSM), and a joint program with the Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering Department of Drexel's College of Engineering, the Master of Science in Cybersecurity (MSC).&lt;ref name="cci.drexel.edu"/&gt; Apart from these specialized programs, a dual degree (MS/MSIS) in Master of Science in Library and Information Science (MS) and Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) is also offered. The college also awards PhD degrees in Information Studies and Computer Science,&lt;ref name="cci.drexel.edu"/&gt; and offers various certificate programs for Professional Development.

===Special programs===
The former iSchool hosted the [[Pennsylvania Governor's School for Information, Society and Technology]] (PGSIST) from 1998 until 2008, at which time the PGSIST was canceled due to statewide budget cuts. The program included a full scholarship summer enrichment program which was committed to meeting the educational needs of academically talented high school students through a five-week-long on college campus program.

Developed jointly by the former iSchool and the Computer Science Department, Drexel now hosts the Drexel University Computing Academy (DUCA). DUCA is a five-week program that allows high school sophomores and juniors  with an interest in the computer field to not only learn about various topics in computing, but also to work on group projects, experience a university environment by living on campus, and participate in various activities in and around Philadelphia.

==Rankings==
In 2007, the College ranked 5th nationally for specialized programs in information systems, 6th nationally for specialized programs in digital librarianship. Overall the library and information science program was ranked 11th for Library and Information Studies Specialties.&lt;ref name="Rankings"&gt;{{cite web| date =August 20, 2009| url =http://www.drexel.edu/univrel/top_ranking/| title =Drexel University A Tradition of Excellence by U.S. News &amp; World Report| publisher =U.S. News &amp; World Report| accessdate =2009-08-20| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091112152834/http://www.drexel.edu/univrel/top_ranking/| archivedate =November 12, 2009| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
One of the College's facilities includes the Rush Building at the corner of 33rd Street and Lancaster Avenue. Constructed in 1904, the Hospital for the Treatment of [[Consumption (disease)|Consumption]] and Related Diseases was named after [[Benjamin Rush]], the famous 18th-century Philadelphia physician and one of the signers of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name="Rush Building"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/Home/About/Facilities/RushBuilding| title =Rush Building| publisher =The iSchool at Drexel University| accessdate =2010-03-31| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100612152118/http://www.ischool.drexel.edu/Home/About/Facilities/RushBuilding| archivedate =2010-06-12| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, Drexel University acquired the building to in part house its Graduate School of Library Science.

From 1978 to 1981, the Rush Building was renovated for sole use by the library and information science programs. The project cost $2.4 million, $1 million of which came from a Pew Charitable Trusts grant. 2006 saw the renovation of the lobby and expansion of the Alumni Garden. In 2008, the Computing Resource Center (computer lab for use exclusively by IST students) was remodeled and renamed the iCommons.

'''Ecological modernization''' is a school of thought in the social sciences that argues that the [[economy]] benefits from moves towards [[environmentalism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} It has gained increasing attention among scholars and policymakers in the last several decades internationally. It is an analytical approach as well as a policy strategy and [[environmentalism|environmental]] [[discourse]] (Hajer, 1995).

==Origins and key elements==
Ecological modernization emerged in the early 1980s within a group of scholars at Free University and the Social Science Research Centre in Berlin, among them [[Joseph Huber (economist)|Joseph Huber]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Martin Jänicke|de}} and {{ill|Udo E. Simonis|de}}. Various authors pursued similar ideas at the time, e.g. [[Arthur H. Rosenfeld]], [[Amory Lovins]], Donald Huisingh, René Kemp, or [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker]]. Further substantial contributions were made by [[Arthur P.J. Mol]], [[Gert Spaargaren]] and [[David A Sonnenfeld]] (Mol and Sonnenfeld, 2000; Mol, 2001).

One basic assumption of ecological modernization relates to environmental readaptation of economic growth and industrial development. On the basis of [[enlightened self-interest]], economy and ecology can be favourably combined: Environmental [[productivity]], i.e. productive use of natural resources and environmental media (air, water, soil, ecosystems), can be a source of future growth and development in the same way as [[labour productivity]] and capital productivity. This includes increases in energy and resource efficiency as well as product and process innovations such as environmental management and sustainable [[supply chain management]], [[clean technology|clean technologies]], benign substitution of hazardous substances, and product design for environment. Radical innovations in these fields can not only reduce quantities of resource turnover and emissions, but also change the quality or structure of the [[industrial metabolism]]. In the co-evolution of humans and nature, and in order to upgrade the environment’s [[carrying capacity]], ecological modernization gives humans an active role to play, which may entail conflicts with nature conservation.

There are different understandings of the scope of ecological modernization - whether it is just about techno-industrial progress and related aspects of policy and economy, and to what extent it also includes cultural aspects (ecological modernization of mind, value orientiations, attitudes, behaviour and lifestyles). Similarly, there is some pluralism as to whether ecological modernization would need to rely mainly on government, or markets and entrepreneurship, or civil society, or some sort of [[multi-level governance]] combining the three. Some scholars explicitly refer to general [[modernization theory]] as well as non-Marxist [[world-systems approach|world-system theory]], others don’t.

Ultimately, however, there is a common understanding that ecological modernization will have to result in innovative structural change. So research is now still more focused on environmental innovations, or eco-innovations, and the interplay of various societal factors (scientific, economic, institutional, legal, political, cultural) which foster or hamper such innovations (Klemmer et al., 1999; Huber, 2004; Weber and Hemmelskamp, 2005; Olsthoorn and Wieczorek, 2006).

Ecological modernization shares a number of features with neighbouring, overlapping approaches. Among the most important are
*the concept of [[sustainable development]]
*the approach of [[industrial metabolism]] ([[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Ayres]] and [[Udo Simonis|Simonis]], 1994)
*the concept of [[industrial ecology]] ([[Robert H. Socolow|Socolow]], 1994)

==Additional elements==
A special topic of ecological modernization research during recent years was ''sustainable household'', i.e. environment-oriented reshaping of lifestyles, consumption patterns, and demand-pull control of supply chains (Vergragt, 2000; OECD 2002). 
Some scholars of ecological modernization share an interest in [[industrial symbiosis]], i.e. inter-site recycling that helps to reduce the consumption of resources via increasing efficiency (i.e. pollution prevention, waste reduction), typically by taking externalities from one economic production process and using them as raw material inputs for another (Christoff, 1996). 
Ecological modernization also relies on product life-cycle assessment and the analysis of materials and energy flows. In this context, ecological modernization promotes 'cradle to cradle' manufacturing ([[Michael Braungart|Braungart]] and [[William McDonough|McDonough]], 2002), contrasted against the usual 'cradle to grave' forms of manufacturing - where waste is not re-integrated back into the production process. 
Another special interest in the ecological modernization literature has been the role of [[social movement]]s and the emergence of civil society as a key agent of change ([[Dana R. Fisher|Fisher]] and Freudenburg, 2001).

As a [[strategy]] of change, some forms of ecological modernization may be favored by [[business]] interests because they seemingly meet the triple bottom line of economics, society, and environment, which, it is held, underpin sustainability, yet do not challenge [[free market]] principles. This contrasts with many [[environmental movement]] perspectives, which regard [[free trade]] and its notion of business self-regulation as part of the problem, or even an origin of [[environmental degradation]]. Under ecological modernization, the [[State (polity)|state]] is seen in a variety of roles and capacities: as the enabler for [[Market (economics)|market]]s that help produce the technological advances via competition; as the regulatory (see [[regulation]]) medium through which [[corporation]]s are forced to 'take back' their various wastes and re-integrate them in some manner into the production of new goods and services (e.g. the way that [[Automobile|car]] corporations in Germany are required to accept back cars they manufactured once those vehicles have reached the end of their product lifespan); and in some cases as an institution that is incapable of addressing critical local, national, and global environmental problems. In the latter case, ecological modernization shares with [[Ulrich Beck]] (1999, 37-40) and others notions of the necessity of emergence of new forms of [[environmental governance]], sometimes referred to as subpolitics or political modernization, where the [[environmental movement]], community groups, businesses, and other stakeholders increasingly take on direct and leadership roles in stimulating environmental transformation. Political modernization of this sort requires certain supporting norms and institutions such as a free, independent, or at least critical press, basic [[human rights]] of expression, organization, and assembly, etc.  [[New media]] such as the [[Internet]] greatly facilitate this.

==Criticisms==
Critics argue that ecological modernization will fail to protect [[environment (biophysical)|the environment]] and does nothing to alter the  impulses within the capitalist economic mode of production (see [[capitalism]]) that inevitably lead to environmental degradation (Foster, 2002). As such, it is just a form of '[[green-washing]]'. Critics question whether [[technology|technological]] advances alone can achieve resource conservation and better [[environmental protection]], particularly if left to business [[self-regulatory organization|self-regulation]] practices (York and Rosa, 2003). For instance, many technological improvements are currently feasible but not widely utilized. The most [[environmentally friendly]] product or manufacturing process (which is often also the most economically efficient) is not always the one automatically chosen by self-regulating corporations (e.g. [[hydrogen]] or [[biofuel]] vs. [[peak oil]]). In addition, some critics have argued that ecological modernization does not redress gross [[injustices]] that are produced within the capitalist system, such as [[environmental racism]] - where [[people of color]] and low income earners bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harm such as pollution, and lack access to environmental benefits such as [[parks]], and [[social justice]] issues such as eliminating [[unemployment]] (Bullard, 1993; Gleeson and Low, 1999; Harvey, 1996) - [[environmental racism]] is also referred to as issues of the asymmetric distribution of environmental resources and services (Everett &amp; Neu, 2000). Moreover, the theory seems to have limited global efficacy, applying primarily to its countries of origin - [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]], and having little to say about the [[developing world]] (Fisher and Freudenburg, 2001). Perhaps the harshest criticism though, is that ecological modernization is predicated upon the notion of 'sustainable growth', and in reality this is not possible because growth entails the consumption of natural and human capital at great costs to [[ecosystem]]s and societies.

Ecological modernization, its effectiveness and applicability, strengths and limitations, remains a dynamic and contentious area of environmental social science research and policy discourse in the early 21st century.

'''The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative''' (ECAI) is a [[digital humanities]] initiative involving numerous academic professors and institutions around the world with the stated goal of creating a networked digital [[atlas]] by creating tools and setting standards for dynamic, digital maps.

ECAI was established in 1997 by Emeritus Prof. [[Lewis Lancaster]] of the University of California, Berkeley, and has held two meetings per year most years from 1998 - 2009 (ongoing), one of which is often in conjunction with the Pacific Neighbourhood Consortium. The initiative is based at UC Berkeley.

The ECAI 'clearinghouse' of distributed digital datasets was developed from 1998 by the Archaeological Computing Laboratory at the University of Sydney, and uses the ACL's [[TimeMap]] software.

{{'}}'''ENA/VASP Homology proteins'''{{'}} or {{'}}'''EVH'''{{'}} proteins are a family of closely related [[proteins]] involved in [[cell motility]] in [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] animals. EVH proteins are modular proteins that are involved in [[actin]] polymerization, as well as interactions with other proteins. Within the cell, Ena/VASP proteins are found at the leading edge of [[Lamellipodia]] and at the tips of [[filopodia]].&lt;ref name="pmid19494122"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bear and Gertler | title = Ena/VASP: towards resolving a controversy at the barbed end | journal = J Cell Sci | year = 2009 | pmid = 19494122 | pmc =  2723151| doi =10.1242/jcs.038125 | last2 = Gertler | first2 = FB | volume = 122 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 1947–53  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ena, the founding member of the family was discovered in a [[Drosophila melanogaster|drosophila]] genetic screen for [[mutations]] that act as [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] suppressors of the [[Abl gene|abl]] non receptor [[tyrosine kinase]]. Invertebrate animals have one Ena homologue, whereas mammals have three, in mice named Mena, VASP, and Evl.

Ena/VASP proteins promote the spatially regulated actin polymerization required for efficient chemotaxis in response to attractive and repulsive guidance cues. Mice lacking functional copies of all three family members display pleiotropic [[phenotypes]] including [[exencephaly]], [[edema]], failures in [[neurite]] formation, and embryonic lethality.

A sub-domain of EVH is the [[EVH1 domain]].

==VASP==

Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP)  45-[[amino acid|residue]]-long [[tetramer]]ization [[protein domain]]  which regulates [[actin]] dynamics in the [[cytoskeleton]]. This is vital for processes such as [[cell adhesion]] and [[cell migration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Yidi |last1=Wu |first2= Susan J. |last2=Gunst|title=Vasodilator-stimulated Phosphoprotein (VASP) Regulates Actin Polymerization and Contraction in Airway Smooth Muscle by a Vinculin-dependent Mechanism|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=290|issue=18|date=1 May 2015|pages=11403–11416|doi=10.1074/jbc.M115.645788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Vasodilator-stimulated [[phosphoprotein]] (VASP) is an [[actin]] [[cytoskeletal]] [[gene regulation|regulatory]] [[protein]]. VASP is often found in dynamic actin structures like [[filopodia]] and [[lamellipodia]], but its precise function in their formation is controversial. VASP accelerates filament elongation by delivering [[monomer]]ic actin to the growing barbed (+) end.&lt;ref name="pmid18923426"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Breitsprecher D, Kiesewetter AK, Linkner J, Urbanke C, Resch GP, Small JV, Faix J | title=Clustering of VASP actively drives processive, WH2 domain-mediated actin filament elongation. | journal=EMBO J | year= 2008 | volume= 27 | issue= 22 | pages= 2943–54 | pmid=18923426 | doi=10.1038/emboj.2008.211 | pmc=2585163 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences''''' is a specialized fifteen-volume [[Encyclopedia]] first published in 1930 and last published in 1967. It was envisaged in the 1920s by scholars working in disciplines which increasingly were coming to be known as "human sciences" or "[[social science]]s". The goal was to create a comprehensive synthesis of the study of human affairs as undertaken by practitioners of all fields involved in such study. The parameters of what would come to be known as "social science" were in many ways initially established and defined by this publication.

The {{em|Encyclopaedia}}'s founding organizations included the [[American Anthropological Association]], the [[American Association of Social Workers]], the [[American Economic Association]], the [[American Historical Association]], the [[American Political Science Association]], the [[American Psychological Association]], the [[American Sociological Society]], the [[American Statistical Association]], the [[Association of American Law Schools]], and the [[National Education Association]]. It was edited by American economists [[Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman]] and [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]]. Seligman and Johnson solicited contributions from many of the most known and respected scholars in their fields, and established many links with European scholars in the process. The [[Rockefeller Foundation]], [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Foundation]], and [[Russell Sage Foundation]] provided initial financial support, and [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] was selected as publisher.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;Encyclopaedia of Social Sciences, Inc. Records, 1927–1934, Rare Book and Manuscript Library, [[Columbia University Library]]. http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead/nnc-rb/ldpd_12107465/dsc/6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. A. J. Johnson, "The Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences", in [[The Quarterly Journal of Economics]], Vol. 50, No. 2 (Feb., 1936), pp. 355–366. {{jstor|1885029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. C.

The international network of social scientists developed in the process of creating the {{em|Encyclopaedia}} would prove especially important during the [[Nazi]] occupation of Europe, during which many contributing scholars fled persecution for their ideas.  Under Johnson's invitation, several of these scholars would come to [[New York City]] and form the "University in Exile", a specialized graduate school now known as the [[New School for Social Research]].&lt;ref&gt;Krohn, Claus-Dieter. 1993.

New York: [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{em|Encyclopaedia}} was last printed in 1967, then in its 16th edition. It was succeeded by the [[International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences]], edited by David L. Sills, and also published by Macmillan.&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

An '''explanandum''' (a [[Latin]] term) is a sentence describing a [[phenomenon]] that is to be [[explanation|explained]], and the '''explanans''' are the sentences adduced as explanations of that phenomenon. For example, one person may pose an ''explanandum'' by asking "Why is there smoke?", and another may provide an ''explanans'' by responding "Because there is a fire". In this example, "smoke" is the ''explanandum'', and "fire" is the ''explanans''.

==In scientific method==
[[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim]] (1948),&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hempel CG, Oppenheim P |year=1948 |title=Studies in the Logic of Explanation |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=XV |pages=135–175 |doi=10.1086/286983|citeseerx=10.1.1.294.3693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their [[deductive-nomological model]] of scientific explanation, motivated the distinction between explanans and explanandum in order to answer why-questions, rather than simply what-questions:

{{Quotation|"the event under discussion is explained by subsuming it under general laws, i.e., by showing that it occurred in accordance with those laws, by virtue of the realization of certain specified antecedent conditions"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.152)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

Specifically, they define the concepts as follows:

{{Quotation|"By the ''explanandum'', we understand the sentence describing the phenomenon to be explained (not that phenomenon itself); by the ''explanans'', the class of those sentences which are adduced to account for the phenomenon"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.152)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

The crucial comment, with respect to the scientific method, is given as follows:

{{Quotation|"It may be said... that an explanation is not fully adequate unless its explanans, if taken account of in time, could have served as a basis for predicting the phenomenon under consideration....  It is this potential predictive force which gives scientific explanation its importance: Only to the extent that we are able to explain empirical facts can we attain the major objective of scientific research, namely not merely to record the phenomena of our experience, but to learn from them, by basing upon them theoretical generalizations which enable us to anticipate new occurrences and to control, at least to some extent, the changes in our environment"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.154)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

'''Fasciation''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|æ|ʃ|i|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə|n}}, from the Latin root meaning "band" or "stripe"), also known as '''cresting''', is a relatively rare condition of abnormal growth in [[vascular plant]]s in which the [[apical meristem]] (growing tip), which normally is concentrated around a single point and produces approximately cylindrical tissue, instead becomes elongated perpendicularly to the direction of growth, thus producing flattened, ribbon-like, crested (or "cristate"), or elaborately contorted, tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w54tp413570j3306/ | title=Fasciation (Preview, page 319) | publisher=The Botanical Review | work=Volume 14, No. 6 | date=June 1948 | accessdate=July 7, 2012 | author=White, Orland E. | pages=319–358}} DOI: 10.1007/BF02861723 {{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fasciation may also cause plant parts to increase in weight and volume in some instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2474652?uid=3739856&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21100902125491 | title=Genetics and Comparative Growth Morphology of Fasciation in Soybeans (Glycine max (L.)

==Causation==
Fasciation can be caused by hormonal imbalances in the [[meristem]]atic cells of plants, which are cells where growth can occur.&lt;ref name="Purdue"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/fascinatingfasciation.html | title=Fascinating Fasciation | publisher=Purdue University Extension | date=September 2007 | accessdate=July 3, 2012 | author=Lerner, B.

Additional environmental factors that can cause fasciation include fungi, [[mite]] or [[insect]] attack and exposure to chemicals.&lt;ref name="Colorado State"/&gt; General damage to a plant's growing tip&lt;ref name="Colorado State"/&gt; and exposure to cold and frost can also cause fasciation.&lt;ref name="Purdue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deleware Extension"/&gt; Some plants, such as peas and cockscomb ''[[Celosia]]'', may inherit the trait.&lt;ref name="Colorado State"/&gt;

Fasciation is not contagious,&lt;ref name="Purdue"/&gt; but bacteria that cause fasciation can be spread from infected plants to others from contact with wounds on infected plants and from water that carries the bacteria to other plants.&lt;ref name="UCIPM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/GARDEN/FLOWERS/DISEASE/fasciation.html | title=Pests in Gardens and Landscapes | publisher=Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program, Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California | date=October 13, 2008 | accessdate=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Although fasciation is rare overall, it has been observed in over 100 plant species,&lt;ref name="Colorado State"/&gt; including members of the [[Genus|genera]] ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', ''[[Aloe]]'', ''[[Acanthosicyos]]'', ''[[Cannabis]]'', ''[[Celosia]]'', ''[[Delphinium]]'', ''[[Digitalis]]'', ''[[Euphorbia]]'', ''[[Forsythia]]'', ''[[Glycine (plant)|Glycine max]]'' (specifically, [[soybean]] plants),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167478100000610 | title=Molecular characterization of two soybean homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana CLAVATA1 from the wild type and fasciation mutant (Abstract) | journal=Gene Structure and Expression | date=April 25, 2000 | accessdate=July 7, 2012 | author=Yamamoto, Etsuo | pages=333–340|display-authors=etal | doi=10.1016/S0167-4781(00)00061-0 | volume=1491}} {{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Primula]]'', ''[[Prunus]]'', ''[[Salix]]'' and many genera of the [[Cactaceae]] (cactus) family.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Cresting results in undulating folds instead of the typical "arms" found on mature [[Saguaro]] cactus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Campus Arboretum |publisher=[[University of Arizona]] |date=2008-08-20 |url=http://arboretum.arizona.edu/heritage_trees.html |accessdate=2010-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106012058/http://arboretum.arizona.edu/heritage_trees.html |archivedate=2010-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some varieties of ''Celosia'' are raised especially for their dependably fasciated flower heads, for which they are called "cockscomb".&lt;ref name="Purdue"/&gt; The Japanese Fantail Willow ''([[Salix sachalinensis|Salix sachalinensis 'Sekka']])'' is another plant that is valued for its fasciations.&lt;ref name="Purdue"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colorado State"/&gt;

==Prevention==
Fasciation that is caused by damage to genetic material and by bacteria can be controlled by not using fasciated plants and disposing of fasciated plants.&lt;ref name="UCIPM"/&gt; Avoiding injury to plant bases and keeping them dry can reduce the spread of bacteria.&lt;ref name="UCIPM"/&gt; Avoidance of grafting fasciated plants and the pruning of fasciated matter can also reduce the spread of bacteria.&lt;ref name="UCIPM"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43755">In [[mathematics]], '''fuzzy sets''' (aka '''uncertain sets''') are somewhat like [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] whose [[Element (mathematics)|elements]] have degrees of membership. Fuzzy sets were introduced independently by [[Lotfi Asker Zadeh|Lotfi A. Zadeh]]&lt;ref&gt;L. A. Zadeh (1965) [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~zadeh/papers/Fuzzy%20Sets-Information%20and%20Control-1965.pdf "Fuzzy sets"]. ''Information and Control'' 8 (3) 338–353.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dieter Klaua&lt;ref&gt;Klaua, D. (1965) Über einen Ansatz zur mehrwertigen Mengenlehre. Monatsb. Deutsch. Akad. Wiss. Berlin 7, 859–876. A recent in-depth analysis of this paper has been provided by {{Cite journal | last1 = Gottwald | first1 = S. | title = An early approach toward graded identity and graded membership in set theory | doi = 10.1016/j.fss.2009.12.005 | journal = Fuzzy Sets and Systems | volume = 161 | issue = 18 | pages = 2369–2379 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1965 as an extension of the classical notion of set.
At the same time, {{harvtxt|Salii|1965}} defined a more general kind of structure called an [[L-relation]], which he studied in an abstract algebraic context. Fuzzy relations, which are used now in different areas, such as [[linguistics]] {{harv|De Cock|Bodenhofer|Kerre|2000}}, [[Decision making|decision-making]] {{harv|Kuzmin|1982}}, and [[Cluster analysis|clustering]] {{harv|Bezdek|1978}}, are special cases of ''L''-relations when ''L'' is the [[unit interval]] [0, 1].

In classical [[set theory]], the membership of elements in a set is assessed in binary terms according to a [[Principle of bivalence|bivalent condition]] &amp;mdash; an element either belongs or does not belong to the set. By contrast, fuzzy set theory permits the gradual assessment of the membership of elements in a set; this is described with the aid of a [[Membership function (mathematics)|membership function]] valued in the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets, since the [[indicator function]]s (aka characteristic functions) of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets, if the latter only take values 0 or 1.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;D. Dubois and H. Prade (1988) Fuzzy Sets and Systems. Academic Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In fuzzy set theory, classical bivalent sets are usually called [[Crisp set|''crisp'' sets]]. The fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise, such as [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;Lily R. Liang, Shiyong Lu, Xuena Wang, Yi Lu, Vinay Mandal, Dorrelyn Patacsil, and Deepak Kumar, "FM-test: A Fuzzy-Set-Theory-Based Approach to Differential Gene Expression Data Analysis", BMC Bioinformatics, 7 (Suppl 4): S7. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A fuzzy set is a pair &lt;math&gt;(U, m)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is a set and &lt;math&gt;m\colon U \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; a membership function. 
The reference set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted by &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) is called '''universe of discourse''', and for each &lt;math&gt;x\in U,&lt;/math&gt; the value &lt;math&gt;m(x)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''grade''' of membership of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;(U,m)&lt;/math&gt;. 
The function &lt;math&gt;m = \mu(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''membership function''' of the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U, m)&lt;/math&gt;.

For a finite set &lt;math&gt;U=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\},&lt;/math&gt; the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;(U, m)&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\{m(x_1)/x_1,\dots,m(x_n)/x_n\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;x \in U.&lt;/math&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is called 
* '''not included''' in the fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;(U,m)&lt;/math&gt; if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;m(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;}} (no member), 
* '''fully included''' if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;m(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;}} (full member), 
* '''partially included''' if {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;0 &lt; m(x) &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (fuzzy member).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/FuzzyLogic AAAI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805071058/http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AITopics/FuzzyLogic |date=2008-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The (crisp) set of all fuzzy sets on a universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is denoted with &lt;math&gt;SF(U)&lt;/math&gt; (or sometimes just &lt;math&gt;F(U)&lt;/math&gt;).&lt;ref name="Beg20019" /&gt;

===Crisp sets related to a fuzzy set===
For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U,m)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; the following crisp sets are defined:
* &lt;math&gt;A^{\ge\alpha} = A_\alpha = \{x \in U \mid m(x)\ge\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''α-cut''' (aka '''α-level set''') 
* &lt;math&gt;A^{&gt;\alpha} = A'_\alpha = \{x \in U \mid m(x)&gt;\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''strong α-cut''' (aka '''strong α-level set''') 
* &lt;math&gt;S(A) = Supp(A) = A^{&gt;0} = \{x \in U \mid m(x)&gt;0\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''support''' 
* &lt;math&gt;C(A) = Core(A) = A^{=1} = \{x \in U \mid m(x)=1\}&lt;/math&gt; is called its '''core''' (or sometimes '''kernel''' &lt;math&gt;Kern(A)&lt;/math&gt;).

Note that some authors understand 'kernel' in a different way, see below.

===Other definitions===
* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A = (U,m)&lt;/math&gt; is '''empty''' (&lt;math&gt;A = \varnothing&lt;/math&gt;) [[iff]] (if and only if)
::[[Universal quantification#notation|&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;math&gt; x \in U: \mu_A(x) = m(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

* Two fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are '''equal''' (&lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;) iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) = \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;

* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is '''included''' in a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;A \subseteq B&lt;/math&gt;) iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) \le \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;

* For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, any &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;, having
::&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) = 0.5&lt;/math&gt; 
:is called a '''crossover point'''.

* For a given fuzzy set A any &lt;math&gt;\alpha\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; for which &lt;math&gt;A^{=\alpha} = \{x \in U | \mu_A(x) = \alpha\}&lt;/math&gt; is not empty, is called a '''level''' of A. 
The '''level set''' of A is the set of all levels α∈[0,1] representing distinct-cuts. It is the target set (aka codomain) of &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda_A = \{\alpha \in [0,1] \mid A^{=\alpha} \ne \varnothing\} = \{\alpha \in [0, 1] \mid\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Existential quantification|&lt;math&gt;\exist&lt;/math&gt;]]&lt;math&gt;x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) = \alpha\} = \mu_A(U)&lt;/math&gt;

* For a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; its '''height''' is given by
::&lt;math&gt;Hgt(A) = sup \{\mu_A(x) \mid x\in{U}\}  = sup(\mu_A(U))&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;sup&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Infimum and supremum|supremum]], which does exist because 1 is an upper bound. If U is finite, we can simply replace the supremum by the maximum.

* A fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''normalized''' iff
::&lt;math&gt;Hgt(A) = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:In the finite case, where the supremum is a maximum, this means that at least one element of the fuzzy set has full membership. A non-empty fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; may be normalized with result &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}&lt;/math&gt; by dividing the membership function of the fuzzy set by its height:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\tilde{A}}(x) = \mu_A(x)/Hgt(A)&lt;/math&gt;
:Besides similarities this differs from the usual [[normalizing constant|normalization]] in that the normalizing constant is not a sum.

* For fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers (U ⊆ ℝ) having a core with [[Infimum and supremum|an upper and a lower bound]] the '''width''' is defined as
::&lt;math&gt;Width(A) = sup(Supp(A)) - inf(Supp(A))&lt;/math&gt;
:This does always exist for bounded a reference set U, especially if U is finite.
:In case that &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt; is a finite or [[closed set]], the width is just
::&lt;math&gt;Width(A) = max(Supp(A)) - min(Supp(A))&lt;/math&gt;
:In the n-dimensional case (U ⊆ ℝ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) the above can be replaced by the n-dimensional volume of &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt;. 
:In general there must exist some [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] for instance by integration (e. g. [[Lebesgue integration]]) of &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

* A real fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (U ⊆ ℝ) is said to be '''convex''' (in fuzzy sense, not to be confused with a crisp [[convex set]]), iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x,y\in{U}, \forall\lambda\in[0,1]: \mu_A(\lambda{x} + (1-\lambda)y) \ge min(\mu_A(x),\mu_A(y))&lt;/math&gt;,
:or (if we assume x≤y, which is no restriction), equivalent, iff
::&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in [x,y]: \mu_A(z) \ge min(\mu_A(x),\mu_A(y))&lt;/math&gt;.
:In general, we may have to choose subsets Z of U and compare like follows:  
::&lt;math&gt;\forall z \in Z: \mu_A(z) \ge inf(\mu_A(\partial{Z}))&lt;/math&gt;,
:where &lt;math&gt;\partial{Z}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] of Z and &lt;math&gt;f(X) = \{f(x)|x \in X\}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Function (mathematics)#Image and preimage|image]] of a set ''X'' (here &lt;math&gt;\partial{Z}&lt;/math&gt;) under a function ''f'' (here &lt;math&gt;\mu_A&lt;/math&gt;).

===Fuzzy set operations===
{{main|Fuzzy set operations}}
In contrast to the complement of a fuzzy set, for which there is a very common definition, union and intersection do have some ambiguity.
* For a given fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; its '''complement''' &lt;math&gt;\neg{A}&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted as &lt;math&gt;A^c&lt;/math&gt; or '''∁'''&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;) is defined by the following membership function:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\neg{A}}(x) = 1 - \mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

* Let t be a [[t-norm]], and s the corresponding s-norm (aka t-conorm). For given fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; their '''intersection''' &lt;math&gt;A\cap{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\cap{B}}(x) = t(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;,
:and their '''union''' &lt;math&gt;A\cup{B}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\cup{B}}(x) = s(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

According to the definitions of t-norms, fuzzy sets inherit laws as [[Commutativity]], [[Monotonicity]], [[Associativity]] and for null and identity element (∅ and U, respectively). However, the union of a fuzzy set and its complement may not result in the full universe U, and the intersection of them may not give the empty set ∅. Intersection and union of a finite [[Indexed family|family]] of fuzzy sets can be defined by recursion, keeping associativity law in mind.

* If the standard negator &lt;math&gt;n(\alpha) = 1 - \alpha, \alpha \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by another [[t-norm#Non-standard negators|strong negator]], the fuzzy set difference may be generalized by
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\neg{A}}(x) = n(\mu_A(x))&lt;/math&gt;. 
:The tripel of fuzzy intersection, union and complement build up a '''De Morgan Triplet''. Examples for fuzzy intersection/union pairs with standard negator can be derived from samples provided in the article about [[t-norm]]s.

:The fuzzy intersection is not idempotent in general, because the standard t-norm min is the only one which has this property. Using arithmetic multiplication a t-norm instead, this defines a specific fuzzy intersection operation not being idempotent. By this, iterating multiplication of a fuzzy set with itself is not trivial. It defines the '''m-th power''' of a fuzzy set which can be canonically generalized for non-integer exponents in the following way:

* For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu \in \R^+&lt;/math&gt; the ν-th power of A is defined by its membership function as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A^{\nu}}(x) = \mu_{A}(x)^{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;
:Special case: Exponent is 2 (quadrature): For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the '''concentration''' &lt;math&gt;CON(A) = A^2&lt;/math&gt; is defined via its membership function as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{CON(A)}(x) = \mu_{A^2}(x) = \mu_{A}(x)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:With &lt;math&gt;0^0 := 1&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;A^0 = U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A^1 = A&lt;/math&gt;.

* For given fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; the fuzzy set '''Difference''' &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B&lt;/math&gt; (sometimes denoted just &lt;math&gt; A - B&lt;/math&gt;) maybe defined straightforward via membership functions:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\setminus{B}}(x) = t(\mu_A(x),n(\mu_B(x)))&lt;/math&gt;,
:which means &lt;math&gt;A \setminus B = A \cap \neg{B}&lt;/math&gt;, e. g.:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\setminus{B}}(x) = min(\mu_A(x),1 - \mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Mamoni Dhar: [http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJEIC/vol4_Is1/2.pdf Cardinality of Fuzzy Sets: An Overview], International Journal of Energy, Information and Communications Vol. 4, Issue 1, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014"&gt;N.R. Vemuri, A.S. Hareesh, M.S. Srinath: [http://www.math.sk/fsta2014/presentations/VemuriHareeshSrinath.pdf Set Difference and Symmetric Difference of Fuzzy Sets], in: Fuzzy Sets Theory and Applications 2014, Liptovský Ján, Slovak Republic&lt;/ref&gt;

:Another proposal for a set difference could be: 
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A-{B}}(x) = \mu_A(x) - t(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x))&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

* Proposals for symmetric fuzzy set differences have been done by Dubois and Prade (1980), either using the absulute:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\triangle{B}}(x) = |\mu_A(x) - \mu_B(x)|&lt;/math&gt;
:or, using a combination of just max, min, and standard negation:
::&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\triangle{B}}(x) = max(min(\mu_A(x), 1 - \mu_B(x)), \,min(\mu_B(x), 1 - \mu_A(x)))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

:Axioms for definition of generalized symmetric differences analog to those for t-norms, t-conorms, and negators have been proposed by Vemur et al. (2014) with predecessors by Alsina et. al. (2005) and Bedregal et. al. (2009).&lt;ref name="Vemuri2014" /&gt;

* In contrast to crisp sets averaging operations can also be defined for fuzzy sets.

===Disjoint fuzzy sets===
In contrast to the general ambiguity of intersection and union operations, there is clearness for disjoint fuzzy sets:
Two fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; are '''disjoint''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) = 0 \lor \mu_B(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
which is equivalent to
:[[Existential quantification#Negation|&lt;math&gt;\nexists&lt;/math&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;x\in{U}: \mu_A(x) &gt; 0 \land \mu_B(x) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;
and also equivalent to 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: min(\mu_A(x),\mu_B(x)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
We keep in mind that min/max is a t/s-norm pair, and any other will do the job here as well.

Fuzzy sets are disjoint, iff their supports are disjoint according to the standard definition for crisp sets.

For disjoint fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; any intersection will give ∅, and any union will give the same result, which is denoted as
:&lt;math&gt;A \dot{\cup} B = A \cup B&lt;/math&gt; 
with its membership function given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{A\dot{\cup}{B}}(x) = \mu_A(x) + \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Note that only one of both summands is greater than zero.

For disjoint fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A, B&lt;/math&gt; the following holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;Supp(A \dot{\cup} B) = Supp(A) \,\dot{\cup}\, Supp(B)&lt;/math&gt;

This can be generalized to finite families of fuzzy sets as follows:
Given a family &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; of fuzzy sets with Index set I (e.g. I = {1,2,3,...n}). This family is '''(pairwise) disjoint''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}\,\exists i\in{I}: \mu_{A_i}(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

A family of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint, iff the family of underlying supports &lt;math&gt;Supp \circ A = (Supp(A_i))_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; is disjoint in the standard sense for families of crisp sets.

Independend of the t/s-norm pair, intersection of a disjoint family of fuzzy sets will give ∅ again, while the union has no ambiguity:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i = \bigcup_{i\in{I}} A_i&lt;/math&gt; 
with its membership function given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in{U}: \mu_{\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i}(x) = \sum_{i\in{I}} \mu_{A_i}(x)&lt;/math&gt;
Again only one of the summands is greater than zero.

For disjoint families of fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A = (A_i)_{i\in{I}}&lt;/math&gt; the following holds true:
:&lt;math&gt;Supp(\dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} A_i) = \dot{\bigcup\limits_{i\in{I}}} Supp(A_i)&lt;/math&gt;

===Scalar Cardinality===
For a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with finite &lt;math&gt;Supp(A)&lt;/math&gt; (i. e. a 'finite fuzzy set'), its '''cardinality''' (aka '''scalar cardinality''' or '''sigma-count''') is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Card(A) = sc(A) = |A| = \sum_{x\in{U}} \mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt;.
In case that U itself is a finite set, the '''relative cardinality''' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;RelCard(A) = ||A|| = sc(A)/|U| = |A|/|U|&lt;/math&gt;.
This can be generalized for the divisor to be an non-empty fuzzy set: For fuzzy sets &lt;math&gt;A,G&lt;/math&gt; with G ≠ ∅, we can define the '''relative cardinality''' by:
:&lt;math&gt;RelCard(A,G) = sc(A|G) = sc(A\cap{G})/sc(G)&lt;/math&gt;,
which looks very similar to the expression for [[conditional probability]]&lt;!--and because of that, sc(A|G) is used instead of sc(A/G)- this in't **set** division, isn't it? --&gt;.
Note:
* &lt;math&gt;sc(G) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; here.
* The result may depend on the specific intersection (t-norm) chosen. 
* For &lt;math&gt;G = U&lt;/math&gt; the result is unambiguous and resembles the prior definition.

===Distance and Similarity===
For any fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the membership function &lt;math&gt;\mu_A: U \to U&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as a family &lt;math&gt;\mu_A = (\mu_A(x))_{x\in{U}} \in [0,1]^U&lt;/math&gt;. The latter is a [[metric space]] with several metrics &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; known. A metric can be derived from a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] (vector norm) &lt;math&gt;\|\,\|&lt;/math&gt; via
:&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha,\beta) = \| \alpha - \beta \,\|&lt;/math&gt;.
For instance, if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is finite, i. e. &lt;math&gt;U = \{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}&lt;/math&gt;, such a metric may be defined by: 
:&lt;math&gt;d(\alpha,\beta) := max \{ |\alpha(x_i) - \beta(x_i)| \bigl\vert i=1..n \}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are sequences of real numbes between 0 and 1. 
For infinite &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum can be replaced by a supremum. 
Because fuzzy sets are unambiguously defined by their membership function, this metric can be used to measure distances between fuzzy sets on the same universe:
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) := d(\mu_A,\mu_B)&lt;/math&gt;,
which becomes in the above sample:
:&lt;math&gt;d(A,B) = max \{ |\mu_A(x_i) - \mu_B(x_i)| \bigl\vert i=1..n \}&lt;/math&gt;
Again for infinite &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; the maximum must be replaced by a supremum. Other distances (like the canonical 2-norm) may diverge, if infinite fuzzy sets are too different, e .g &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarity measures (here denoted by &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) may then be derived from the distance, e. g. after a proposal by Koczy:
:&lt;math&gt;S = 1 / (1 + d(A,B))&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else, 
or after Williams an Steele:
:&lt;math&gt;S = exp(-\alpha{d(A,B)})&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is finite, &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; else
where &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; is a steepness parameter and &lt;math&gt;exp(x) = e^x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Beg20019"&gt;Ismat Beg, Samina Ashraf: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228744370_Similarity_measures_for_fuzzy_sets Similarity measures for fuzzy sets], at: Applied and Computational Mathematics, March 2009, available on Research Gate since November 23rd, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Another definition for interval valued (rather 'fuzzy') similarity measures &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is provided by Beg and Ashraf as well.&lt;ref name="Beg20019" /&gt;

===L-fuzzy sets===
Sometimes, more general variants of the notion of fuzzy set are used, with membership functions taking values in a (fixed or variable) [[algebraic structure|algebra]] or [[structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of a given kind; usually it is required that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; be at least a [[poset]] or [[lattice (order)|lattice]]. These are usually called '''''L''-fuzzy sets''', to distinguish them from those valued over the unit interval. The usual membership functions with values in [0,&amp;nbsp;1] are then called [0,&amp;nbsp;1]-valued membership functions. These kinds of generalizations were first considered in 1967 by [[Joseph Goguen]], who was a student of Zadeh.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Goguen|Goguen, Joseph A.]], 196, "''L''-fuzzy sets". ''Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications'' '''18''': 145–174&lt;/ref&gt; A classical corollary may be indicating truth and membership values by {f,t} instead of {0,1}.

An extension of fuzzy sets has been provided by Atanassov and Baruah. An '''intuitionistic fuzzy set''' (IFS) &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is characterized by two functions:
:1. &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; - degree of membership of x
:2. &lt;math&gt;\nu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; - degree of non-membership of x
with functions &lt;math&gt;\mu_A, \nu_A: U \mapsto [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) + \nu_A(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

This resembles a situation like some person denoted by &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; voting 
* for a proposal A (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=1, \nu_A(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;), 
* against it (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=0, \nu_A(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;), 
* or abstain from voting (&lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)=\nu_A(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;).
After all, we have a percentage of approvals, a percentage of denials, and a percentage of abstentions.

For this situation, special 'intuitive fuzzy' negators, t- and s-norms can be provided. 
With &lt;math&gt;D^* = \{(\alpha,\beta) \in [0, 1]^2 \mid \alpha + \beta = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and by combining both functions to &lt;math&gt;(\mu_A,\nu_A): U \to D^*&lt;/math&gt; this situation resembles a special kind of L-fuzzy sets.

Once more, this has been expanded by defining '''picture fuzzy sets''' (PFS) as follows: A PFS A is characterized by three functions mapping U to [0, 1]: &lt;math&gt;\mu_A, \eta_A, \nu_A&lt;/math&gt;, 'degree of positive membership', 'degree of neutral membership', and 'degree of negative membership' respectively and additional condition &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) + \eta_A(x) + \nu_A(x) \le 1&lt;/math&gt;
This expands the voting sample above by an additional possibility 'refusal of voting'.

With &lt;math&gt;D^* = \{(\alpha,\beta,\gamma) \in [0, 1]^3 \mid \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; and special 'picture fuzzy' negators, t- and s-norms this resembles just another type of L-fuzzy sets.&lt;ref&gt;Bui Cong Cuong, Vladik Kreinovich, Roan Thi Ngan: [http://digitalcommons.utep.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2050&amp;context=cs_techrep A classification of representable t-norm operators for picture fuzzy sets], in: Departmental Technical Reports (CS).

== Fuzzy logic ==
{{main|Fuzzy logic}}

As an extension of the case of [[multi-valued logic]], valuations (&lt;math&gt;\mu : \mathit{V}_o \to \mathit{W}&lt;/math&gt;) of [[propositional variable]]s (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{V}_o&lt;/math&gt;) into a set of membership degrees (&lt;math&gt;\mathit{W}&lt;/math&gt;) can be thought of as [[membership function (mathematics)|membership functions]] mapping [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] into fuzzy sets (or more formally, into an ordered set of fuzzy pairs, called a fuzzy relation).  With these valuations, many-valued logic can be extended to allow for fuzzy [[premise]]s from which graded conclusions may be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;[[Siegfried Gottwald]], 2001. ''A Treatise on Many-Valued Logics''. Baldock, Hertfordshire, England: Research Studies Press Ltd., {{ISBN|978-0-86380-262-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension is sometimes called "fuzzy logic in the narrow sense" as opposed to "fuzzy logic in the wider sense," which originated in the [[engineering]] fields of [[automation|automated]] control and [[knowledge engineering]], and which encompasses many topics involving fuzzy sets and "approximated reasoning."&lt;ref&gt;"The concept of a linguistic variable and its application to approximate reasoning," ''Information Sciences'' '''8''': 199–249, 301–357; '''9''': 43–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Industrial applications of fuzzy sets in the context of "fuzzy logic in the wider sense" can be found at [[fuzzy logic]].

== Fuzzy number and interval ==
{{main|Fuzzy number}}
A '''fuzzy number''' is a convex, normalized fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{A}}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers (U ⊆ ℝ) whose membership function is at least segmentally [[continuous function|continuous]]{{Clarify|date=September 2017}} and has the functional value &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; at at least one element.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because of the assumed convexity the maximum (of 1) is 
* either an interval: '''fuzzy interval''', its core is a crisp interval (mean interval) with lower bound

::&lt;math&gt;\min \,C(A) = \min(\{x \in \R \mid \mu_A(x)=1\})&lt;/math&gt; 
:and upper bound 
::&lt;math&gt;\max \,C(A) = \max(\{x \in \R \mid \mu_A(x)=1\})&lt;/math&gt;.
* or unique: '''fuzzy number''', its core is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]; the location of the maximum is 
::℩ C(A) = ℩&lt;math&gt;x \in \R : \mu_A(x)=1&lt;/math&gt; (where ℩ reads as '[[Definite description#Mathematical logic|this]]');
:which will assign a 'sharp' number to the fuzzy number, in addition to fuzzyness parameters like &lt;math&gt;Width(A)&lt;/math&gt;.

Fuzzy numbers can be likened to the [[funfair]] game "guess your weight," where someone guesses the contestant's weight, with closer guesses being more correct, and where the guesser "wins" if he or she guesses near enough to the contestant's weight, with the actual weight being completely correct (mapping to 1 by the membership function).

A '''fuzzy interval''' is a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;{\mathit{A}}\subseteq\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with a core interval, i. e. a mean interval whose elements possess the membership function value &lt;math&gt;\mu_{A}(x)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
The latter means that fuzzy intervals are normalized fuzzy sets. As in fuzzy numbers, the membership function must be convex, normalized, at least segmentally [[continuous function|continuous]].&lt;ref&gt;"Fuzzy sets as a basis for a theory of possibility," ''Fuzzy Sets and Systems'' '''1''': 3&amp;ndash;28&lt;/ref&gt; Like crisp intervals, fuzzy intervals may reach infinity. The kernel &lt;math&gt;K(A) = Kern(A)&lt;/math&gt; of a fuzzy interval &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the 'inner' part, without the 'outbound' parts where the membership value is constant ad infinitum. In other words, the smallest subset of &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x)&lt;/math&gt; is constant outside of it, is defined as the kernel.

However, there are other concepts of fuzzy numbers and intervals as some authors do not insist on convexity.

==Fuzzy categories==
The use of [[Set theory|set membership]] as a key components of [[category theory]] can be generalized to fuzzy sets. This approach which initiated in 1968 shortly after the introduction of fuzzy set theory&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Goguen "Categories of fuzzy sets : applications of non-Cantorian set theory" PhD Thesis University of California, Berkeley, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; led to the development of "Goguen categories" in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Winter "Goguen Categories:A Categorical Approach to L-fuzzy Relations"  2007 [[Springer Verlag|Springer]] {{ISBN|9781402061639}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuzzy relation equation ==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
The [[fuzzy relation equation]] is an equation of the form {{nowrap|1=''A'' · ''R'' = ''B''}}, where ''A'' and ''B'' are fuzzy sets, ''R'' is a fuzzy relation, and {{nowrap|''A'' · ''R''}} stands for the [[Function composition|composition]] of ''A'' with&amp;nbsp;''R'' {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}.

==Entropy==
A measure d of fuzzyness for fuzzy sets of universe &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; should fulfill the following conditions for all &lt;math&gt;x \in U&lt;/math&gt;:
#&lt;math&gt;d(A) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a crisp set: &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \in \{0,\,1\}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(A)&lt;/math&gt; has a unique maximum iff &lt;math&gt;\forall x \in U: \mu_A(x) = 0.5&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;d(A) \ge d(B)&lt;/math&gt; iff 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(x) \le \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \le 0.5&lt;/math&gt; and 
:::&lt;math&gt;\mu_a(x) \ge \mu_B(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\mu_A(x) \ge 0.5&lt;/math&gt;, 
::which means that B is 'crisper' than A.
#&lt;math&gt;d(\neg{A}) = d(A)&lt;/math&gt;   
In this case &lt;math&gt;d(A)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''entropy''' of the fuzzy set A.

For '''finite''' &lt;math&gt;U = \{x_1, x_2, ... x_n\}&lt;/math&gt; the entropy of a fuzzy set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = H(A) + H(\neg{A})&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;H(A) = -k \sum_{i=1}^n \mu_A(x_i) \ln \mu_A(x_i)&lt;/math&gt;
or just
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = -k \sum_{i=1}^n S(\mu_A(x_i))&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;S(x) = H_e(x)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Binary entropy function|Shannon's function]] (natural entropy function)
:&lt;math&gt;S(\alpha) = -\alpha \ln \alpha - (1-\alpha) \ln (1-\alpha), \alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant depending on the measure unit and the logarithm base ([[e (mathematical constant)|here: e]]) used.
Physical interpretation of k is the [[Boltzmann constant]] k&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a fuzzy set with a '''continuous''' membership function (fuzzy variable). Then 
:&lt;math&gt;H(A) = -k \int_{- \infty}^\infty \operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace \ln \operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace \,dt&lt;/math&gt;
and its entropy is 
:&lt;math&gt;d(A) = -k \int_{- \infty}^\infty S(\operatorname{Cr} \lbrace A \geq t \rbrace )\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

==Extensions==
There are many mathematical constructions similar to or more general than fuzzy sets. Since fuzzy sets were introduced in 1965, a lot of new mathematical constructions and theories treating imprecision, inexactness, ambiguity, and uncertainty have been developed. Some of these constructions and theories are extensions of fuzzy set theory, while others try to mathematically model imprecision and uncertainty in a different way ({{harvnb|Burgin|Chunihin|1997}}; {{harvnb|Kerre|2001}}; Deschrijver and Kerre, 2003).

The diversity of such constructions and corresponding theories includes:

'''Gold glass''' or '''gold sandwich glass''' is a luxury form of [[glass]] where a decorative design in [[gold leaf]] is fused between two layers of glass.  First found in [[Hellenistic Greece]], it is especially characteristic of the [[Roman glass]] of the [[Late Roman Empire|Late Empire]] in the 3rd and 4th century AD, where the gold decorated roundels of cups and other vessels were often cut out of the piece they had originally decorated and cemented to the walls of the [[catacombs of Rome]] as grave markers for the small recesses where bodies were buried.  About 500 pieces of gold glass used in this way have been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204-5; Lutraan, iii and 2 (note also); 8–9 Corning video&lt;/ref&gt;  Complete vessels are far rarer.  Many show religious imagery from Christianity, traditional Greco-Roman religion and its various cultic developments, and in a few examples Judaism. [[List of gold-glass portraits|Others show portraits of their owners]], and the finest are "among the most vivid portraits to survive from Early Christian times. They stare out at us with an extraordinary stern and melancholy intensity".&lt;ref&gt;Honour and Fleming, Pt 2, "The Catacombs" at illustration 7.7&lt;/ref&gt;  From the 1st century AD the technique was also used for the gold colour in [[mosaic]]s.

Various different techniques may sometimes also be described as "gold glass". [[Zwischengoldglas]] is very similar but the two layers of glass are cemented, not fused. It mostly comes from Germany and [[Bohemia]] from the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Verre églomisé]] properly covers a single layer of glass which is [[gilding|gilded]] (or coated with other types of metal leaf) on the back, as used in 19th century shop signs and the like. One process was revived by Jean-Baptise Glomy (1711–1786), hence the name. Both of these processes were also used in ancient times, and the German and French languages often use their native terms for what is called "gold glass" in English. [[Gold ruby glass]] or "cranberry glass" is actually red, coloured by the addition of [[gold(III) oxide|gold oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.cmog.org/research/glass-dictionary/g#gold-glasses Corning Museum "Glass glossary"] entries for all these terms&lt;/ref&gt;  '''Gold-band glass''' is another ancient technique covered below.

==Technique==
The manufacturing process for gold glass was difficult and required great skill.  For a Late Roman glass, first a small round flat disc, typically about three to five inches across, was cut away from a [[glass-blowing|blown]] sphere with a flattened bottom, either made of coloured or plain glass.  A piece of gold leaf was then glued to this with [[gum arabic]].  The design was created by scraping away gold leaf.  The main vessel, a cup or bowl, was formed by blowing and cutting, with a flat bottom the same size as the first disc.  This was then heated again and carefully lowered onto the disc with the design, superimposing the flat bottom with the disc with the design so that they fused together.  The complete vessel was then heated a final time to complete the fusing.  Different accounts of different periods vary somewhat as to the precise sequence of stages and other details, but the process is essentially the same.&lt;ref&gt;Corning video; see also the [http://www.cmog.org/research/glass-dictionary/g#gold-glasses Corning Museum "Glass glossary"], which appears to somewhat contradict the video.&lt;/ref&gt;

The larger [[Hellenistic glass]] bowls are thought to have been formed using [[moulds]] rather than blown, as the whole bowl is doubled and the inner and outer vessels must fit together exactly.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, 190&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of gold-glass portraits|Some of the finer later medallions]] seem to have been made as such from the start, and some contain pigments other than the gold.&lt;ref&gt;Example from the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] showing both features; also Gennadios and the Brescia portrait&lt;/ref&gt;  These smoother-edged medallions exploited the medium of glass as a matrix for [[portrait miniature]]s, and it has proved to be a very effective one, outlasting all alternatives except for precious metal and [[engraved gem]]s. They were probably initially made to be hung for display, or set in jewellery in smaller examples like that of Gennadios, but were also used for funerary purposes, and often use a base of blue glass.  They are a few Roman examples of vessels from Cologne of a different style where several of what have been called "sidewall blobs", small gold glass medallions about 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm across, with images, are fused into the walls of a vessel&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204; Lutraan, 3–4 and note, now British Museum; Vickers, 612–613 has the best photos of "blobs"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Roman - Bowl - Walters 4784 - View A.jpg|thumb|left|Roman bowl with gold band glass]]

Apart from roundels with figurative images the fused sandwich technique was used to create the [[tesserae]] for gold in [[mosaic]]s, and for beads and the like. Gold glass tesserae, at least by Byzantine times, had a very thin top layer of glass, which was probably poured onto the lower glass with the gold leaf glued to it. Tesserae were made in blocks or "cakes" and then cut into cubes, which are relatively large in the case of gold backgrounds.  Gold backgrounds were laid over earth red or [[yellow ochre]] backgrounds which enhanced their visual effect.  Most colours of tesserae seem to have been made locally to the mosaic, but there is some discussion as to whether this was true for gold glass ones.  In the 11th century the relatively new Christian centre of [[Kiev]] seems to have used gold tesserae made in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, 388–391; Grove, 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman gold glass beads were made by using an inner tube or rod to which the gold leaf was stuck.  A larger tube was slid over that and the beads crimped off.  Easily transported and very attractive, Roman gold glass beads have been found as far outside the Empire as the [[Wari-Bateshwar ruins]] in [[Bangladesh]], and sites in China, [[Korea]], [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis, 91–93&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gold-band glass''' is a related Hellenistic and Roman technique, where strips of gold leaf, sandwiched between colourless glass, are used as part of the marbling effect in [[onyx glass]].  It is mostly found in small perfume bottles and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rgld/hd_rgld.htm Trentinella, Rosemarie.

==Grave-markers==
[[File:Dougga Banquet.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Dougga]] banquet scene, 3rd century (see text)]] 
The most common form of vessel in late Roman examples was a bowl or drinking cup, which are thought to have been originally family gifts for weddings, anniversaries, New Year, the various religious festivals and the like, in some cases perhaps presented at birth or Christian baptism.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25; Weitzmann no. 396; Rudgers, 85&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the type of gold glass vessels cut down as grave-markers has survived complete, though about 500 of the cut-off bottoms are known,&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204; Lutraan, iii and 2 (note also), 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; but since so many have inscriptions encouraging the owner to drink, they are usually referred to as "cups" or "glasses".  However Roman drinking cups and glasses were often very wide and shallow, though tall straight-sided or slightly flared shapes like modern [[List of glassware#Tumblers|tumblers]] are also found.  A mosaic in the North African ruins of [[Dougga]] shows two hefty slaves pouring wine from ''[[amphorae]]'' into two shallow bowls held by slaves waiting on the banquet. The two ''amphorae'' are inscribed with "ΠΙΕ" and "ΣΗϹΗϹ" the Greek originals of the toasting formulae "pie zeses" ("Drink, may you live", discussed below) so common on Roman glasses, and it has been suggested that the mosaic shows the shape a complete cup would have had.&lt;ref&gt;by Smith, see Lutraan, 75 and note 197&lt;/ref&gt;

At what was probably a much later date, perhaps after decades of use, on the death of the owner the main vessel of undecorated glass was cut away and trimmed to leave only the gold glass roundel, which was then used in the catacombs as a grave marker.  Presumably in many cases the cup had already broken in the normal course of use, and the thick bottom with the decoration had been preserved for later use in this way.  Bodies were buried in the catacombs in small recesses called ''loculi'', stacked one above another mostly along narrow corridors hollowed out from the soft rock, and no doubt some form of marker was necessary for visitors to locate the right spot.  They may also have functioned as a seal on the grave, as they were pressed into the mortar or [[stucco]] forming the final surface of the wall of the ''loculus''; other classes of small decorative objects were also used in the same way.  They may also have been regarded as capable of warding off evil spirits, especially in the later part of the period, when portraits of saints become most common.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 84–85; Grig, 204–209, and throughout; Beckwith, 25; Honour and Fleming, Pt 2, "The Catacombs" at illustration 7.6; Lutraan, 4–5&lt;/ref&gt;  The very untidy trimming of many examples may be explained by this; an example in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] is still attached to a chunk of mortar round much of its edge, showing that the mortar overlapped the edge of the glass.  Rough edges would mostly have been hidden by the mortar and also provided a firmer key for the mortar to hold the glass in place (as it happens the edges of the New York piece are unusually neatly trimmed).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170003396# Bowl Base with Christ Giving Martyrs’ Crowns to Saints Peter and Paul], MMA online, accn. 11.91.4; see also Lutraan, 5 and note 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pieces of gold glass had portraits of private individuals, mostly married couples, who may have included the deceased, while others had portraits of religious figures such as saints, or religious symbols. This custom was followed by Christian, Jewish (13 identifiably Jewish examples are known) and pagan Romans. The different sets of imagery, apart from the increased number of private portraits, are typical of the paintings also found in the catacombs and other [[Early Christian art]] and its Jewish equivalent from the period.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25–26; For Jewish material, Rudgers, 81–85 (13 examples on 81); Weitzmann p. 371 and numbers 347 ff.; Lutraan, 12 and throughout&lt;/ref&gt;  As Christian art developed in the late 4th and 5th centuries, its changes are reflected in the subjects and their treatment in gold glass, before the catacombs ceased to be used and the supply of examples ends.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 503, 507–8, 510 are late examples&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hellenistic period==
The technique was used in [[Hellenistic]] times, and Hellenistic examples are generally both more technically ambitious than Roman ones, with wide bowls or drinking cups decorated all round their curved sides in gold glass, and executed with more artistry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/130011897?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=%22gold+glass%22&amp;pos=1 Gold-glass skyphos (drinking cup) fragment], Metropolitan Museum of Art (23.160.76)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Museum]] has a virtually complete bowl (broken but repaired) 19.3&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 11.4&amp;nbsp;cm high, one of two from a tomb in [[Canosa]] in [[Apulia]] dating to around 270–160 BC. It has most of the interior very finely decorated with [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] and [[acanthus (plant)|acanthus]] motifs, which are more typical of gold glass in this period than designs with human figures.  There are a handful of other near complete examples, and rather more fragments.  These pieces are usually assigned to [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, which is often seen as the originating centre for luxury Hellenistic glass, and is mentioned as the source of over-elaborate glass by the 1st century [[satirist]] [[Martial]] and other sources; one seems to show a [[Nile|Nilotic]] landscape, though this was a popular subject elsewhere.  However fragments have been found when excavating a glass factory on [[Rhodes]].&lt;ref&gt;Rotroff, 333&lt;/ref&gt;  A description perhaps dating from the 270s BC (surviving in the works of the later writer [[Athenaeus]]) mentions two vessels that are ''diachysa'' ("with gold in it") and very likely made by this technique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/s/sandwich_gold-glass_bowl.aspx "Sandwich gold-glass bowl"], British Museum online highlights; Williams, 190. Though textually very similar, these differ over the dating, with the book (2009) saying 210–160 BC and the website (in May 2013) 270–200 BC.

==Roman period==
[[File:Galla Placidia (rechts) und ihre Kinder.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Detail of a gold glass medallion with a portrait of a family, from [[Alexandria]] ([[Roman Egypt]]), 3rd–4th century ([[Brescia]], [[Museo di Santa Giulia]])&lt;ref name="elsner 2007 p 17 fig p 18"/&gt;]]

Gold glass mosaic tesserae begin to be used in domestic mosaics in the 1st century AD, with Rome apparently the first location. They continued to be used throughout the ancient and medieval periods into the modern day. By around 400 gold began to be used as the background colour for Christian religious mosaics, as it was throughout the Byzantine period.&lt;ref&gt;Conventi, 1–3; specifically, "[http://www.mosaicmatters.co.uk/news/news_confonbyzglass.htm the earliest known use of gold tesserae was in 55 AD, in the Gardens of Lucullus by the Spanish Steps in Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decorated late Roman pieces are usually assumed to have been made in and around Rome, especially in the case of portraits of residents there, but also in the [[Rhineland]] around [[Cologne]] and [[History of Trier|Augusta Treverorum]], modern [[Trier]], which was a centre for other luxury glass products like [[cage cup]]s.  Alexandria is still thought to have been a major centre, and from linguistic analysis of the inscriptions it has been suggested that the technique, and perhaps the actual artists and craftsmen, reached Rome and Germany from there.  Yet it may just be a coincidence of survival that the other large body of "middle-class" portraiture from the period is the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 25; Hennig, 215&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the Rhineland finds discussed below, small numbers of cut-off vessel bases have been found in northern Italy and modern [[Hungary]] and [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gennadios medallion in New York, illustrated above, is a fine example of an Alexandrian portrait on blue glass, using a rather more complex technique and naturalistic style than most Roman examples, including painting onto the gold to create shading, and with the Greek inscription showing local [[dialect]] features.  He had perhaps been given or commissioned the piece to celebrate victory in a musical competition.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, no. 264, entry by J.D.B.; see also no. 265; [http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170006564 Medallion with a Portrait of Gennadios], Metropolitan Museum of Art, with better image.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous Alexandrian-style portrait medallions, with an inscription in Egyptian Greek, was later mounted in an [[Early Medieval]] [[crux gemmata]] in [[Brescia]], in the mistaken belief that it showed the pious empress and [[Ostrogoths|Gothic]] queen [[Galla Placida]] (died 450) and her children;&lt;ref&gt;Boardman, 338–340; Beckwith, 25&lt;/ref&gt; in fact the knot in the central figure's dress may mark a devotee of [[Isis]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, 611&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait in the Brescia medallion also shares clear stylistic features with the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] of [[Roman Egypt]], in addition to a Greek inscription in the [[Alexandria]]n dialect of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;For a description of scholarly research on the Brescia Medallion, see Daniel Thomas Howells (2015). "[https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Late_Antique_Gold_Glass_online.pdf A Catalogue of the Late Antique Gold Glass in the British Museum (PDF).]" London: the British Museum (Arts and Humanities Research Council), p. 7. Accessed 2 October 2016.).
&lt;br&gt;"''Other important contributions to scholarship included the publication of an extensive summary of gold glass scholarship under the entry ‘Fonds de coupes’ in Fernand Cabrol and Henri Leclercq’s comprehensive Dictionnaire d’archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie in 1923. Leclercq updated Vopel’s catalogue, recording 512 gold glasses considered to be genuine, and developed a typological series consisting of eleven iconographic subjects: biblical subjects; Christ and the saints; various legends; inscriptions; pagan deities; secular subjects; male portraits; female portraits; portraits of couples and families; animals; and Jewish symbols. In a 1926 article devoted to the brushed technique gold glass known as the Brescia medallion (Pl. 1), Fernand de Mély challenged the deeply ingrained opinion of Garrucci and Vopel that all examples of brushed technique gold glass were in fact forgeries. The following year, de Mély’s hypothesis was 
supported and further elaborated upon in two articles by different scholars. A case for the Brescia medallion’s authenticity was argued for, not on the basis of its iconographic and orthographic similarity with pieces from Rome (a key reason for Garrucci’s dismissal), but instead for its close similarity to the Fayoum mummy portraits from Egypt. Indeed, this comparison was given further credence by Walter Crum’s assertion that the Greek inscription on the medallion was written in the Alexandrian dialect of Egypt. De Mély noted that the medallion and its inscription had been reported as early as 1725, far too early for the idiosyncrasies of Graeco-Egyptian word endings to have been understood by forgers.''"
&lt;br&gt;"''Comparing the iconography of the Brescia medallion with other more closely dated objects from Egypt, Hayford Peirce then proposed that brushed technique medallions were produced in the early 3rd century, whilst de Mély himself advocated a more general 3rd-century date. With the authenticity of the medallion more firmly established, Joseph Breck was prepared to propose a late 3rd to early 4th century date for all of the brushed technique cobalt blue-backed portrait medallions, some of which also had Greek inscriptions in the Alexandrian dialect. Although considered genuine by the majority of scholars by this point, the unequivocal authenticity of these glasses was not fully established until 1941 when Gerhart Ladner discovered and published a photograph of one such medallion still in situ, where it remains to this day, impressed into the plaster sealing in an individual loculus in the Catacomb of Panfilo in Rome (Pl. 2). Shortly after in 1942, Morey used the phrase ‘brushed technique’ to categorize this gold glass type, the iconography being produced through a series of small incisions undertaken with a gem cutter’s precision and lending themselves to a chiaroscuro-like effect similar to that of a fine steel engraving simulating brush strokes.''"&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of a group of 14 pieces dating to the 3rd century AD, all individualized secular portraits of high quality.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 207&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Jás Elsner (2007) contends that the Brescia medallion, likely depicting a family from Alexandria since the inscription is in the [[Greeks in Egypt|Alexandrian dialect of Greek]], has a range of possible dates ranging from the early-3rd to mid-5th century AD, before it found its way to Italy where it adorned a 7th-century [[Christian cross]].&lt;ref name="elsner 2007 p 17 fig p 18"&gt;Jás Elsner (2007).

It is thought that the tiny detail of pieces such as these can only have been achieved using [[lens (optics)|lens]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Sines and Sakellarakis, 194–195&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the refined "Alexandrian" medallions, wherever they were actually produced, mostly have a simple thin gold line framing the subject, the Roman examples have a variety of heavier frames, often using two round borders, the style of which forms part of efforts to group them by workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 83&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of portraiture is rudimentary, with features, hairstyles and clothes all following stereotypical styles.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 207; Lutraan, 29–45 goes into considerable detail&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:KHM Wien Zwischengoldglas Heilige XIa 37.jpg|thumb|300px|Two Christian saints, 4th century]]

An "Alexander plate with hunting scene" in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] is, if genuine,&lt;ref&gt;Presumably the piece described by Vickers (p. 610) as "widely suspected to be a modern forgery"&lt;/ref&gt; a very rare example of a complete vessel decorated with gold glass, and comes from the upper elite of Roman society.  It is a shallow bowl or plate 25.7&amp;nbsp;cm (10 1/8 inches) in diameter and 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm (1 3/4 inches) high. The decorated flat roundel in the centre takes about two thirds of the whole diameter. It shows a mounted huntsman with a spear pursuing two [[elk]], while beneath his horse a huntsman on foot with a hound on a leash confronts a [[wild boar]]. The Latin inscription "{{lang|la|ALEXANDER HOMO FELIX PIE ZESES CUM TUIS}}" means "Alexander fortunate man, drink, may you live, together with yours".  The identity of "Alexander" has been the subject of discussion, but he is on the whole though to be an unknown aristocrat rather than [[Alexander the Great]] or the Emperor [[Alexander Severus]] (reigned 232–235). The dish is perhaps slightly later than his reign and at least during his reign he could never be addressed as merely a "man".&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann, no. 79, entry by R.B., which translates the inscription "Alexander, fortunate man, may you live [long] with your family and friends in affection" – a more literal version is given here; [http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1969.68?collection_search_query=Gold+glass&amp;year_operator=1&amp;year=400&amp;year_era=1&amp;year_end=&amp;year_end_era=1&amp;op=search&amp;form_build_id=form-1kMpg1FTVNs9NMt11E5m_8sn7Wqte6vJABKNb5yRWiE&amp;form_id=clevelandart_collection_search_form Cleveland Museum of Art], online collection image. The object was not on display in May 2013. It was intact in about 1900 but broken in 1968, then repaired. The image from Cleveland show large areas of the undecorated glass missing, that are present in Weitzmann's black-and-white photo.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Greek drinking toast ZHCAIC given in Latin letters as ZESES, meaning "live!" or "may you live", is a very common part of inscriptions on gold glass,&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 388, and 347–348 etc; Lutraan, 53&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes the only inscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170003564 Bowl Base with Miracle Scenes], Metropolitan Museum of Art (16.174.2)&lt;/ref&gt;  It is more common than the Latin equivalent VIVAS, probably because it was considered more refined, somewhat like the modern "bon appétit" used in English.  Two glasses including images of Jesus "misspell" "ZESES" as "ZESUS", managing to achieve wordplay between a drinking toast and the name of the Christian saviour.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Gladiator in gold glass.jpg|thumb|left|Gladiator in gold glass]]

Such secular "blessings" are typical, and on roundels made from cups they often urge the owner to drink, even when the [[iconography]] is religious.  One Jewish example has the usual array of symbols and the inscription "Drink, [so] you may live, Elares".  The [[Wedding at Cana]] is a popular Christian subject, with one example inscribed "Worthy of your friends, may you live in the peace of God, drink".&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 347 and 396 respectively&lt;/ref&gt;  Another popular phrase is DIGNITAS AMICORUM or "[you are] the honour of your friends".&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 57–58&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of inscriptions are made up of either names or such conventional expressions, or the two combined.  An example inscribed "DIGNITAS AMICORVM PIE ZESES VIVAS" typifies the tendency to pile together the common phrases.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;  The convivial dedications found on so many examples are paralleled by several of the far more luxurious [[cage cup]]s or ''diatreta''.

One round bottom from a larger bowl found in the catacombs is 10.8&amp;nbsp;cm across, and now in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]].  It has five abbreviated scenes from the Old and New Testaments surrounding a married couple in a roundel, with the feet of the outer figures to the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Newby, 24–25 (with photo); Vickers, 610–611&lt;/ref&gt;  A large and complex bowl from Cologne was decorated all over with Christian scenes and Imperial portraits, but presumably because of its size (height 8.6, diameter 11.4&amp;nbsp;cm) no second layer of glass was fused on, so the gold has now all been lost, though the shapes of the design can be seen.  The portraits of the sons of [[Constantine I]] allow an unusually precise probable dating to 326, his ''[[vicennalia]]'', or the 25th anniversary of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 377. Made, found and still in Cologne, now [[Römisch-Germanisches Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another complete piece is a [[paten]] from the [[Basilica of St. Severin, Cologne]], founded in the 4th century.  This is decorated with roundels containing [[Old Testament]] scenes and floral motifs. According to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', [[Pope Zephyrinus]], in office from 199–217, had approved the use of glass patens, and ones in other glass techniques survive.&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 270&lt;/ref&gt;  A variant technique is only known from vessels from Cologne with what have been called "sidewall blobs", where small gold glass medallions with images are fused into the walls of a vessel; one of the few examples was found in the cemetery of St Severin.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 204; Lutraan, 3–4 and note, now British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography of the vessel bottoms==
[[File:Gold glass Christian plate, 4th century.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Saint Peter]], [[Virgin Mary]] in [[orant]] pose, [[Saint Paul]], 4th century]]
Almost all the Roman vessel bottoms have imagery of some sort, and around 240 have legible inscriptions as well. Of these, about half of the total number of gold glasses known,&lt;ref&gt;As catalogued by Lutraan; most of this section uses her for quantitative statements&lt;/ref&gt; portraits are most common, but there are small narrative scenes, mainly Christian but a few pagan.  Portraits of Christian sacred figures are on about half the full corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 215&lt;/ref&gt; There are a small number of depictions of sports, animals, wreaths and the like, and a single example with a central image of a plant.  No Imperial portraits are recorded, nor military scenes; unlike so much Roman public art the glasses concentrate on the private interests of individuals.  Apart from a single near-naked [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and some figures of [[Erotes (mythology)|erotes]],&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; sexual themes are another notable absence compared to much Roman art.  Most glasses feature a single image occupying most of the round space within the border, but some have a number of small scenes, usually arranged in small circular frames around a central image. Most portraits are between bust and half-length.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, Chapter 2; Milburn, 270–272&lt;/ref&gt;  The small number of glasses with Jewish iconography are covered separately below.

Either portraits or inscriptions naming private individuals are very common, though other examples have no personalizing aspect and were perhaps just bought from a dealer's stock.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 29–31&lt;/ref&gt;  Portraits of married couples are at first most the common, but saints were more numerous towards the end of the period; the two are also often combined.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, reported by Lutraan, 11, 14, 17&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not always possible to distinguish the two confidently, despite ''[[titulus (inscription)|tituli]]'' inscriptions and a convention of using contemporary dress for owners and a conventional out of date costume for sacred figures, even recent male ones such as [[Pope Damasus I]] (r. 366–384). Damasus, exceptionally for a contemporary cleric, appears on at least four glasses, or at least it is thought he is who "DAMAS" refers to.&lt;ref&gt;"DAMAS" on 4 glasses per Grig, 5 per Lutraan; Grig, 208–215 and ff.; Lutraan, 31–32 and pages following, page 39 on female sacred figures who dress in more contemporary styles.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saints Peter and Paul together are very common, usually facing each other in profile, but sometimes with other figures.  Both were martyred in Rome, and especially popular there;&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 40–42; Milburn, 270–272; Grig, 216–217&lt;/ref&gt; other local martyrs such as [[Saint Agnes|Agnes]] are depicted several times,&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 44–45, Grig, 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Lucy Grig "the ''Roman-ness'' of the saints portrayed on the Roman glasses is striking", and five popes from the 3rd and 4th centuries are probably depicted.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 215–216, 215 quoted, 219–220 on popes&lt;/ref&gt;  Christ is shown in a number of examples, usually as clean-shaven and youthful, as well as figures such as the [[Good Shepherd]] which may symbolize him, or in some cases [[Orpheus]] or general [[bucolic]] imagery.  A small Christ may stand between the heads of a married couple, blessing them.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 42–44&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orant]]s perhaps representing the soul of an owner when not identified as a saint, and as in the catacombs always shown as female, appear a number of times, and female saints and the Virgin are always shown in the orant pose.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 44–45; Grig, 220–221&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gold glass Resurrection of Lazarus, 4th century.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Christian ''[[Raising of Lazarus]]'', 4th century]]

Narrative scenes from the Old Testament are more common than miracles of Christ, as in the catacomb paintings, and the same "abbreviated representations" of scenes of deliverance feature: the story of [[Jonah]], [[Daniel in the lions' den]], the three youths in the [[Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego|Fiery Furnace]].&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;  The most common scenes in later Christian art, centred around the liturgical calendar, are very rare.  There are really only two non-Christian narrative scenes: one labour of Hercules (two more are shown in "sidewall blobs"), and one of [[Achilles]], but a number of "portrait" figures, as with Christian sacred figures often combined with owners.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a small number of "agonistic" or sporting scenes, with wrestlers, boxers, one gladiator, and several racing chariot teams.  Several of these, like others seeming to represent victory in a musical or dramatic context, feature palms and crowns and may well have been presented to celebrate victory in these fields in some amateur or professional setting, like the Alexandrian Gennadios portrait.  Two identical glasses featuring two boxers with a trainer, all named, suggest that the glasses may sometimes have been ordered in sets; one may speculate that this may have been common.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;  Single examples show [[Athena]] presiding over shipbuilders, a pair of personifications of Rome and Constantinople, and female figures representing the ''[[monetae]]'' or mints, which are often shown on coins. A number have animals that may carry symbolic meaning, or objects such as scrolls or wreaths.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

The short inscriptions tend to be similar regardless of the content of the image, with names and the "convivial formulae" described above together or separately predominating. A religious implication (as may be intended in ''vivas'' or ''zeses'' for example) is relatively rarely explicitly stated.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan's chapter 3 analyses these, and chapter 4 discusses relations between the images and their accompanying inscriptions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The names are in the single ''[[cognomen]]'' form which is hard to relate to such records as survive,&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 62&lt;/ref&gt; but three glasses can possibly be related to known individuals who were potential owners, and one to a family (that of the poet [[Ausonius]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;  These persons are rather grand, and one might think belonged to the classes buried in [[sarcophagi]] rather than ''loculi''; the glasses perhaps belonged to ''"amici"'', clients or dependents, or had passed as gifts or legacies by the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 211–212&lt;/ref&gt;  One glass in the British Museum is unusual in a number of respects: between a named couple is a smaller figure of Hercules, and the inscription: "ORFITVS ET CONSTANTIA IN NOMINE HERCVLlS ACERENTINO FELICES BIBATIS" or "Orfitus and Constantia, may you live/drink in happiness in the name of Hercules of Acerentia".  This may well represent Memmius Vitruvius Orfitus, prefect of Rome, and his wife. [[Acerenthia|Acerentia]] in southern Italy had a local cult of Hercules.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/g/gold-glass_medallion_showing_h.aspx "Gold-glass medallion showing Herakles"]; Lutraan, 67–70&lt;/ref&gt;  For some historians Orfitus was "notorious as the propaganda mastermind of the 'pagan revival'" of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Grig, 208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish glasses==
[[File:2nd century Rome gold goblet shows Jewish ritual objects.jpg|thumb|300px|Jewish ritual objects, Rome, 2nd century AD]]

Only 13 of the more than 500 known Late Roman vessel bottoms are identifiably Jewish, but these have still been said to represent "the most appealing group of Jewish realia that have come down from antiquity".&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 81. What Rudgers' figure includes is not absolutely clear (for example glasses with non-Jewish imagery found in Jewish catacombs).&lt;/ref&gt;  They are all presumed to have been used in the Roman catacombs as grave-markers, though as with the examples identifiable with other religions, the exact [[find spot]] and context of the great majority is unrecorded.  Rather surprisingly, the only two of the 13 with full histories were found in Christian catacombs, whereas the only gold glass remains found in Jewish catacombs have no Jewish iconography,&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 82; Grig, 228&lt;/ref&gt;  and show that "some Jews felt no qualm in using gold glasses with pagan iconographical motifs".&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 85; Elsner's article casts doubt on the whole notion of separate arts for Jews and Christians in the period&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifiably Jewish roundels do not feature portraits but with one exception have a fairly standard array of religious symbols.  The most common arrangement is on two levels, with two [[Lion of Judah|Lions of Judah]] flanking a [[Torah ark]] above, and below two [[menorah (Temple)|menarot]], a [[shofar]] (rams horn), [[etrog]], [[lulav]] and perhaps others of the [[four Species]], scrolls and vases.  Not all the tiny symbols can be confidently identified.&lt;ref&gt;Weitzmann nos. 347–348; Rutgers, 82. One finely painted example in the [[Israel Museum]] mentioned by Rutgers, 83 and with an image at the external link at the end of the article has two birds flanking the Torah ark and the lions with a single Menorah below.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the objects are all in the top tier, above a banqueting scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/170005829 Bowl Fragments with Menorah, Shofar, and Torah Ark], Metropolitan Museum of Art (18.145.1a, b), also in Weitzmann as no. 348; for another variant on this theme in the Vatican, see Elsner, 115–116&lt;/ref&gt;  The single exception to such compositions has what is thought to be a representation of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]], perhaps representing the feat of [[Purim]].&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 82–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars are confident that Jewish customers used the same workshops as those of the other religions, who presumably kept patterns for designs for all religions, or were provided with sketches.  Some of the attempts to group glasses by workshop attribute Jewish glasses and those of other religions to the same workshop.  Apart from the use of symbols rather than human figures, the Jewish glasses seem to have been used in very much the same way as those from other religious groups, which is also characteristic of other classes of Jewish artefacts from Rome at this time, where the Jewish community adopted many aspects of the general Roman way of life.  Of the 13 known, five have inscriptions including the phrase "''pie zeses''" (see above) and two "''anima dulcis''" (literally "sweet soul", equating to "sweetheart"), both very common phrases in Christian and pagan inscriptions. The rarer phrase "''vivas cum ...''" ("live with ...") is also found on Jewish and non-Jewish glasses.  They would seem to have been given as gifts on the same sort of occasions, and there is evidence that Roman Jews shared the general Roman custom of New Year present-giving.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, 83–85, and more generally for shared artistic and cultural practices: 81, 85, 88 and throughout; Grig, 205 and note; Elsner, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gold-glass portrait of two young men (Bologna).jpg|thumb|4th-century portrait, now in [[Bologna]]]]
The technique continued to be used for mosaic tesserae, and at times for pieces that remained relatively large, for example in a small tile in New York with a pattern forming a cross, perhaps from a [[Syria]]n church of the 9th to 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/170008121?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=%22gold+glass%22&amp;pos=10 Metropolitan Museum of Art (46.174)]&lt;/ref&gt;  A small group of Islamic vessels are decorated with mostly simplified vegetal motifs and probably date to the 10th century from [[Syria]]; the most complete ones are decorated over a large curved area and must have been made by using a "double vessel" method.  In both respects these are closer to the Hellenistic vessels than most Roman ones.&lt;ref&gt;Wenzel, summary on p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

From at least the 17th century the Roman glasses attracted [[antiquarian]] interest and they began to be removed from the catacombs, in a largely disorganized and unrecorded fashion; now only a "handful" remain in their original position in the catacomb walls.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 4&lt;/ref&gt;   The first significant publication on them was by [[Filippo Buonarroti]] in 1716, ''Osservazioni sopra alcuni frammenti di vasi antichi di vetro ornate di figure trovati nei cimiteri di Roma'' ("Observations on some fragments of antique glass vases decorated with figures, found in the cemeteries of Rome"), in which he made the extraordinary, almost [[Romanticism|proto-Romantic]] assertion that the aesthetic crudity of early Christian art, often remarked by connoisseurs of Roman arts, had served to intensify the piety of the worshipper, an early expression of feeling for [[primitive art]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, 307 and note; [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19539 James Hall, "Michelangelo and the Etruscans", ''New York Review of Books'' '''53'''.17 · 2 November 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;  After other studies, the Italian [[Jesuit]] [[Raffaele Garrucci]] published the first illustrated survey in 1858, with an expanded second edition in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, 307&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 19th century a number of imitations, copies and downright forgeries of Roman pieces were made, mostly in [[Murano]] off [[Venice]], by firms such as [[Salviati (glassmakers)|Salviati]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, throughout; for example, no. 1043 in the catalogue of ''Roman Glass in the Corning Museum of Glass: volume three, Part 2'', ed. David B. Whitehouse, 2004, Hudson Hills, {{ISBN|0872901556}}, 9780872901551, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bBBkBJN_lJMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=Roman+gold+glass&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XIGKUbePI5Ko0AXW2YCwBA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Roman%20gold%20glass&amp;f=false google books]; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/projects/gold_glass_in_late_antiquity.aspx Gold glass in late antiquity: the British Museum collection]&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major public exhibition of these seems to have been at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Exposition Universelle of 1878]] in Paris, by Italian firms.&lt;ref&gt;Rudoes, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of museums around the world have examples of Roman vessel bottoms.&lt;ref&gt;Apart from the Vatican, a blurb for Morey's catalogue mentions collections in: "Ostia Antica, Arezzo, Parma, Brescia, Turin, Catania, Florence, Bologna, Verona, Pesaro, Naples, London, Oxford, Barcelona, Tel-Aviv, Paris, Cologne, Bonn, Frankfurt, Wurzburg, Munich, Vienna and New York". (Abebooks)&lt;/ref&gt; The largest collection is in the [[Vatican Museums]], with the 60 pieces of Late Antique glass in the British Museum the second largest.  A research project on their collection was due to finish in 2010 (see further reading below).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/projects/gold_glass_in_late_antiquity.aspx Gold glass in late antiquity: the British Museum collection]; see External links for many photos of the Vatican's collection&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wilshere Collection in the Ashmolean is the third largest, with some 34 pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Vickers describes the whole collection, on loan to the museum from [[Pusey House]] until bought in 2007. The glass is described at 609–613&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Corning Museum of Glass]] has 18 examples and the Metropolitan Museum in New York nearly as many.  The most recent of many catalogues since the 18th century are by C.R. Morey in 1959, with 460 Roman vessel bases, against 426 in S. Smith's thesis of 2000. The corpus continues to be expanded by occasional new finds.&lt;ref&gt;Lutraan, 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of [[real estate development]] at the '''graduate school''' level has taken many forms, giving rise to various educational models in different countries. The decision for individuals pursuing higher education in this field often comes down to choosing between a traditional degree with a focus on [[real estate]] (e.g., [[MBA]] with concentration in real estate) or an interdisciplinary, comprehensive degree (e.g., [[Master of Real Estate Development]]) focused wholly on real estate studies.

Students who opt to study in a full-time Master of Real Estate program, should expect to take courses in topics such as financial analysis, market analysis, contracts and deal-making, construction, design fundamentals,  asset (property) management, construction management, building technology and design fundamentals.  Some programs offer studio, capstone, or workshop courses in which students engage actual real estate development projects. Some also provide access to internships. There is no established accreditation system in the United States in real estate development education, so students should investigate offerings in each program.

While there are many real estate ''finance'' programs available to students around the country, there are only a handful of real estate '''''development''''' graduate programs that tackle the broader educational task of engaging the full range of '''real estate development''' (e.g., Master of Real Estate Development) --from property acquisition to planning and permitting, law and finance, design and construction, and culminating in marketing, commercial leasing, property, portfolio and asset management.

==History==
Historically, graduate level coursework in real estate was limited to a major or minor in business, or training in architecture and urban planning schools. While [[Business school]] programs might emphasize the business side of real estate, MBA students typically lack adequate understanding of real estate principles and processes. Over the last several decades, the real estate industry has matured to one with great complexity and an increasingly institutional ownership structure. The increased complexity of the industry created a demand for practitioners who possessed a comprehensive knowledge of real estate beyond that of traditional MBA generalists. One and two-year graduate level real estate degree programs originated with the founding of the [[New York University]] Real Estate Institute in (1967)&lt;ref name="History and Mission of NYU Schack "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scps.nyu.edu/academics/departments/schack/about/history.html| title= History and Mission | publisher= New York University | accessdate=2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (now known as the NYU Schack Institute of Real Estate) and in 1983 with the formation of the [[MIT]] [http://mitcre.mit.edu/ Center for Real Estate]. Soon after, other schools followed with [[Harvard University]] (1983) [[Texas A&amp;M University]] (1984), [[Columbia University]] (1985), the [[University of Southern California]] (1986), [[Johns Hopkins University]] (1989), and [[Cornell University]] (1996) all forming professional graduate programs focused solely on real estate education.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

According to the [[Urban Land Institute]], during the mid-1990s strong academic interest in real estate "was never greater, whether for repositioning products, redeveloping inner cities, or developing more affordable housing. Students seemed to be acting on the notion that it's a temporary downturn and graduate school is a good place for the moment."&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land, Teaching Real Estate Today, April 1992, pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  As enrollment grew, real estate programs responded by adding more course offerings to satisfy the demand..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the early 2000s, prior to the [[Great Recession]], the industry again acknowledged increasing need for graduates with superior qualifications — providing the research-based expertise necessary to solve complex problems in contemporary real estate development..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The late 2000s saw significant expansion of real estate programs to second-tier universities such as [[George Mason University]], as well as additional coursework added by [[MBA]] programs that commonly did not have an emphasis on real estate. To deal with the complexity of the field and its far-reaching effects, today's industry professionals require advanced training to prepare them to operate in increasingly technical and interrelated areas..{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

As education needs have changed, business schools such as the [[University of Wisconsin]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], and [[University of California, Berkeley]] continue to cater to students interested in the flexibility of an MBA. Wharton's real estate program, for example, takes advantage of being housed in one of the top business schools in the United States and having some of the top real estate professionals in the world as advisers.&lt;ref&gt;Urban Land, October 1991, pg. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduate-level education rankings in the US==
Rankings for graduate level education are not specifically formal as other professional disciplines. [[MBA]] programs with concentrations in real estate may be ranked according to organizations such as ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' or ''[[Business Week]]'', but are not relative to the depth of the real estate industry studied in an MBA concentration compared with a specialized master's degree in real estate or real estate development. Real estate education has increased in recent years to fill the demand for well-educated practitioners in the industry. However, there has been a great deal of debate on what elements should be an essential part of a graduate program in order to help students succeed in the industry. Rankings have been conducted by editorial board representation of faculty members at university real estate departments, however, these results prove to be ineffective in judging the program as a whole. Many graduate programs utilize adjunct professors or guest speakers from the industry, which do not sit on editorial boards of scholarly real estate journals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Currently there are no rankings of graduate degree programs in real estate development. The best method to evaluate the various degree programs is through due diligence by individual applicants, including a review of each program's curriculum and how it applies to the students academic and career goals. While there are no formal rankings for graduate real estate education, and programs are subject to greater locational impact factors than are MBA programs (due to regional and local policy influence).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===ULI Hines Student Competition===

A separate metric to evaluate the success of graduate real estate programs is the review of past winners in the [[Urban Land Institute]] [[Gerald D. Hines]] Student Competition. The Urban Land Institute is a non-profit research and education organization with membership by real estate developers, urban planners, architects and allied professionals. Each year graduate-level students form their own multidisciplinary teams (from real estate, urban planning and business schools) and have two weeks to devise a comprehensive design and development program for a real, large-scale site full of challenges and opportunities. Submissions will consist of boards that include drawings, site plans, tables, and a myriad of market-feasible financial data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uli.org/programs/awards-competitions/hines-student-design-competition/about-the-competition/ |title=Gerald D. Hines Student Urban Design Competition &amp;#124; Urban Land Institute |publisher=Udcompetition.org |date=2013-10-11 |accessdate=2013-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multidisciplinary teams are not limited to including students from [[real estate development]] graduate programs. Students may also come from [[Master of Landscape Architecture]], [[Master of Architecture]], [[Master of Urban Planning]], [[Master of Urban Design]] or [[MBA]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== The CASE at MIT ===
Arguably the most prestigious competition to gauge the quality of graduate real estate programs in the world, the CASE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aacre.alumgroup.mit.edu/s/1314/clubs-classes-interior.aspx?sid=1314&amp;gid=175&amp;pgid=3053 |title=The CASE - MIT Center for Real Estate Alumni Association |publisher=aacre.alumgroup.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual real estate competition that provides current graduate student teams from the world's top universities an opportunity to compete against one another, showcase their knowledge, and learn from each other through the analysis of a complex real world development site. The CASE is organized and hosted by the Alumni Association of the MIT Center for Real Estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mitcre.mit.edu |title=MIT Center for Real Estate |publisher=mitcre.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other master's degree competitions, The CASE focuses on real estate acquisition, development programming and financial underwriting at the asset level. The competition mimics the professional circumstances and assignments that students interested in real estate finance, acquisitions and development are likely to encounter after graduation. Past finalists included: Harvard, Georgetown, Columbia, Yale, NYU, MIT, Cornell, Wharton at UPenn, London Business School, Cambridge and Hong Kong Institute of Technology.

==Undergraduate real estate education==
As with many [[MBA]] programs, undergraduate real estate education is commonly offered as a concentration, or focused area of study. Very few universities with varying academic reputation offer a bachelor's degree with a concentration in real estate (typically two courses during the senior year). An undergraduate degree in real estate is not a prerequisite for admission to a graduate real estate development program. Students from diverse backgrounds in [[geography]], [[urban planning]], business, economics, [[liberal arts]], architecture or seeking a career change are encouraged to apply.

{{See also| Undergraduate real estate programs}}

==Graduate real estate programs==
There are twenty-one multi-disciplinary real estate programs which focus on the academic study of real estate primarily, the '''Master of Real Estate Development''', while the majority of the other programs typically housed as part of a business school offer a more focused degree on finance and investment. Graduate real estate programs may award any number of degrees (e.g. [[Master of Real Estate Development]], [[Master of Science in Real Estate]], [[Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate]], Master of Design Studies in Real Estate), however, the key is to review each degree curricula independent of their respective naming conventions, as there are broad differences in their content and foci that may not necessarily be reflected in the degree's name.

Two examples of graduate real estate degree naming conventions include:

===Master in Real Estate Development (MRED or MSRED)===
The Master of Real Estate Development degree (MRED) (or sometimes called the Master of Science in Real Estate Development (MSRED)) largely focuses on specific areas within real estate rather than taking a more generalist approach. Areas of concentration may include: [[real estate development]], [[finance]] and [[investment]], [[planning]] and [[policy]], [[infrastructure]] and [[construction]], [[market analysis]], and [[real estate law]]. Students are generally exposed to the full range of functions and most real estate product types (e.g. residential, retail, office, hospitality, and industrial). MRED programs typically teach the subject matter through case studies and field experiences and by way of traditional class lectures. Whether in the context of urban redevelopment, historic preservation, or suburban growth, MRED students learn from both the investor's and developer's perspective, the importance of relevant issues in law, economics, finance, market analysis, negotiation, lease analysis, architecture, planning, and management.&lt;ref&gt;''Urban Land Magazine'' School for Developers, c, D.C.: Urban Institute, March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many focus on the entire spectrum of the real estate development process-from dirt-to-deal, finance to façade-and include industry topics presented by leading local and national developers, financiers, and other players in the market. Included in this is the analysis of existing real estate assets and partnership structures.

===Master of Science in Real Estate (MSRE)===
The Master of Science in Real Estate degree (MSRE) often combines learning comprehensive business management skills with the understanding of how real estate markets work. Graduate programs that award a Master of Science in Real Estate degree are sometimes the expansion of real estate courses in a [[Business school]] into a degree of increased specialty or they are organically formed real estate centers within a larger college. Students who complete Master of Science in Real Estate degrees oftentimes go on to careers as real estate "project managers, asset management advisors, analysts, planners, and others." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carey.jhu.edu/academics/master-of-science/ms-in-real-estate-infrastructure |title=Master of Science in Real Estate - Carey School of Business |publisher=carey.jhu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Master of Science in Real Estate degrees are completed in one year though two year options with the opportunity to complete a summer internship between the first and second year are available (e.g. the [[University of Washington]]) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://realestate.washington.edu/academics/masters-of-real-estate/ |title=Master of Science in Real Estate - Runstad Center for Real Estate Studies |publisher=realestate.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate is also similarly found here, as it is simply a naming convention at [[Georgetown University]] and [[Cornell University]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Coursework===
The course work in real estate programs varies among universities. Many programs utilize [[Harvard Business School|HBS]]-style [[case studies]] of complex real estate scenarios to heighten the student's knowledge and strategic decision-making skills. Program lengths range from 30 to 72 credit hours. Programs that have more than 33 hours will sometimes allow its students to add a concentration. A required core curriculum is typical with the core curriculum's size and makeup being largely dependent on the length and focus of the program.

Example core curriculum:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wpcarey.asu.edu/master-real-estate/academics/index.cfm |title=Academics - MRED - W. P. Carey School of Business |publisher=Wpcarey.asu.edu |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2013-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601131326/http://wpcarey.asu.edu/master-real-estate/academics/index.cfm |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Real Estate Development Principles
*[[Market Segmentation]] and Analysis
*Real Estate Finance and Analysis
*Real Estate Development Project Management
*Advanced Real Estate Finance
*Real Estate Site Analysis and Design
*Public [[Entitlement]] Process

In addition to the core curriculum, most two-year programs and some one-year programs offer students the opportunity to pursue a concentration, a focus on a specialized area of interest within the real estate industry. Concentrations differ between programs and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arch.umd.edu/real_estate_development/academics/courses.cfm?p=41 |title=Real Estate Development - Academics - Courses |publisher=arch.umd.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221010354/http://www.arch.umd.edu/real_estate_development/academics/courses.cfm?p=41 |archivedate=December 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some programs, such as the MS in Real Estate Development at [[George Mason University]],&lt;ref name="gmu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://som.gmu.edu/real-estate-development/|title=Masters in Real Estate Development Program – George Mason University|accessdate=2014-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer students the opportunity to combine elective coursework from several disciplines including business management, public policy and civil engineering.

=== Design education related to real estate development ===
The practice of real estate development requires practitioners to work with selecting building types and designs, determining appropriate dimensions, programming internal spaces, shaping the site, and appropriately fitting the project to surrounding contexts.  Some programs, including Harvard University's Master of Design and Columbia University's MSRED include design education in the study of real estate development.  A new program established at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York, in 2015 emphasizes a capstone studio-workshop in which a multidisciplinary group of students under faculty supervision engage an actual real estate development problem for organizations acting as clients.&lt;ref name="ap.buffalo.edu"&gt;{{cite web|title = Master of Science specializing in Real Estate Development - B/a+p|url = http://ap.buffalo.edu/real-estate-development.html|website = ap.buffalo.edu|access-date = 2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Executive programs in real estate==

Executive degree programs in real estate offer practicing professionals the opportunity to learn while they are working. These programs are distinguished from distance programs through their uniquely blended model of residency classroom experience, distance education modules, and executive field study courses. Classes meet at the beginning of every semester, usually from five to seven days, and then complete the coursework through synchronous webinars, asynchronous discussion boards, and video lectures. [[Executive education]] in real estate is taught at numerous accredited institutions such as [[Auburn University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mred.auburn.edu/ |title=Auburn University Executive MRED |publisher=Mred.auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===List of graduate real estate programs outside the United States===

{{Main| Graduate real estate programs outside the United States}}

A number of universities around the world offer graduate degrees in real estate and related subjects. See the list in [[Graduate real estate programs outside the United States]].

==Nationally recognized research centers==
Real estate programs and alumni donors sponsor research by real estate faculty in numerous areas of real estate including the economics of property markets, the impacts of regulation, and the sources of equity and debt financing. Additional research, in the form of faculty-supervised student thesis work, contributes to a growing inventory of new information. The research program is essential to promoting new knowledge, advancing teaching techniques, and bridging the gap between theory and practice. Not all graduate real estate programs conduct research.

==Related graduate program offerings==
Professionals in real estate often hold degrees in related fields such as [[city planning]], construction management, accounting, property management, architecture or law. One of the most common programs continues to be a [[Master of City Planning]], regional planning, or urban planning degree with a real estate emphasis. Planning programs tend to emphasize land use planning, transportation or infrastructure development, land use law and policy and other planning topics; students who take a concentration in real estate development will learn how it relates to planning.

===MBA with Real Estate Concentration===
Business degrees with real estate concentrations generally provide students with the opportunity to pursue a general management degree, but to specialize in real estate development or some segment of the real estate industry through a sequence or group of electives. For a long time, those wishing to study real estate had to content themselves with primarily pursuing a [[Master of Business Administration]] degree, perhaps with the option of concentration in real estate, and usually with a focus in finance. These [[MBA]] programs typically only include one or two courses focused in real estate. Many MBA programs do not specialize in real estate.

For those weighing an MBA versus graduate real estate education, there are some issues to consider:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!
! '''MBA'''
!'''Graduate Real Estate (MSRE, MSRED, MRED, MPS/RE)'''
|-
|'''Timeframe''' || 2 years full-time || 1 or 2 years; part or full-time
|-
|'''Curriculum''' || 1st year - Business Basics; 2nd year - Specialization largely focused on finance-related areas || Real estate focus and specialization throughout
|-
|'''Specialization''' || Real Estate in MBA programs is very rare. Specialization tends to be finance focused || Broad-based real estate education in design, management, law, development, economics and significant focus on finance, e.g., real estate finance, capital markets
|-
|'''Program size''' || Typically, the programs are large with real estate students representing a relatively small (2% - 3%) percentage || Small groups, with commonly 25 to 50 students
|-
|'''Industry Commitment''' || Students pursuing an MBA may not be committed to a real estate career; therefore they are seeking a broader base || All students are committed to the real estate industry and many have real-estate related experience prior to coming to the program. An important part of the programs are the learning between students.
|-
|'''Career opportunities''' || Varied but with a heavy concentration in finance-related areas of the real estate industry || Significant representation in project management, development, finance-related areas, acquisitions, entrepreneurship and government
|-
|'''Thesis''' || Generally, not required || Typically required, usually as a professional publication or a real-life capstone competition
|-
|'''Alumni network''' || Usually extensive, but predominantly outside of the real estate industry || Alumni are involved in all facets of the industry and located throughout the world
|-
|'''Recruitment''' || Limited recruitment by real estate companies || Many students seeking employment find opportunities through peers, professors or on-site recruitment
|}

====MBA real estate concentration offerings====
A limited number of MBA programs offer courses in real estate as part of the typical study in business.

'''Hi uTandem''', also known as '''uTandem''', is a free language exchange mobile app. It helps people to connect with other language learners in order to carry out face-to-face language exchange sessions and also offers learners lists of businesses in the field of language learning or language exchange.&lt;ref&gt;"uTandem Social Language Exchange". iTunes Store. Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/utandem-social-language-exchange/id1074400598?mt=8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Hi uTandem is built around the concept of [[language exchange]], which is a method of language learning based on mutual oral linguistic exchange between partners. Ideally, each partner is a native speaker of the language they are helping their counterpart to learn. The app designed for users to chat with other users and translate messages, find suitable language partners and to locate language schools, bars, cafés and language exchange groups around them.

==Team and development==
Hi uTandem was released in January, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;"An app developed in Ronda pairs up language-learners with native speakers". SUR in English. Link: http://www.surinenglish.com/20160129/news/costasol-malaga/developed-ronda-pairs-language-201601291242.html&lt;/ref&gt; The initial idea was conceived by Alberto Rodríguez as part of a team of eight Spanish youngsters. Hi uTandem belongs to the company Velvor Tech S.L.,&lt;ref&gt;Hi uTandem - Terms of Use. Link: http://hiutandem.com/terms-of-use.html&lt;/ref&gt; founded by the same members and registered in Ronda (Spain).&lt;ref&gt;Información Empresas.

Various [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s contributed to the development of [[internal combustion engine]]s. In 1791, [[John Barber (engineer)|John Barber]] developed a [[turbine]]. In 1794 Thomas Mead patented a gas engine. Also in 1794 Robert Street patented an internal combustion engine, which was also the first to use the liquid fuel (gasoline), and built an engine around that time. In 1798, [[John Stevens (inventor, born 1749)|John Stevens]] designed the first American internal combustion engine. In 1807, [[France|French]] engineers [[Nicéphore Niépce|Nicéphore]] (who went on to invent [[photography]]) and [[Claude Niépce]] ran  a prototype internal combustion engine, using controlled dust explosions, the [[Pyréolophore]]. This engine powered a boat on the [[Saône]] river, France. The same year,  the  [[Swiss]] engineer [[François Isaac de Rivaz]] built an internal combustion engine ignited by electric spark. In 1823, [[Samuel Brown (engineer)|Samuel Brown]] patented the first internal combustion engine to be applied industrially, one of his engines pumped water on the [[Croydon Canal]] from 1830 to 1836. He also demonstrated a boat using his engine on the Thames in 1827, and an engine driven carriage in 1828.

Father [[Eugenio Barsanti]], an Italian engineer, together with [[Felice Matteucci]] of Florence invented the first real internal combustion engine in 1853. Their patent request was granted in London on June 12, 1854, and published in London's Morning Journal under the title "Specification of Eugene Barsanti and Felix Matteucci, Obtaining Motive Power by the Explosion of Gasses". In 1860, [[Belgian]] [[Etienne Lenoir|Jean Joseph Etienne Lenoir]] produced a gas-fired internal combustion engine. In 1864, [[Nikolaus Otto]] patented the first atmospheric gas engine. In 1872, American [[George Brayton]] invented the first commercial liquid-fueled internal combustion engine. In 1876, [[Nikolaus Otto]], working with [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]], patented the compressed charge, four-cycle engine. In 1879, [[Karl Benz]] patented a reliable [[two-stroke]] gas engine. In 1892, [[Rudolf Diesel]] developed the first compressed charge, compression ignition engine. In 1926, [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]] launched the first liquid-fueled rocket. In 1939, the [[Heinkel He 178]] became the world's first [[jet aircraft]].  In 1954 German engineer [[Felix Wankel]] patented a "pistonless" engine using an eccentric rotary design.

*1864: [[Nikolaus Otto]], patented in England and other countries his first atmospheric gas engine. Otto was the first to build and sell this type of compressionless  engine designed with an indirect-acting free-piston, whose great efficiency won the support of [[Eugen Langen]] and then most of the market, which at that time was mainly for small stationary engines fueled by lighting gas.  [[Eugen Langen]] collaborated with Otto in the design and they began to manufacture it in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;http://services.eng.uts.edu.au/~johnd/ICEngines/HISTORY%20OF%20THE%20OTTO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventors  claimed their engine could burn on almost any petroleum based fuel of any octane and even some alcohol based fuels—e.g. kerosene, benzine, motor oil, tractor oil, etc.—without the pre-combustion knock and the complete burning of the fuel injected into the cylinder.

==Engine starting==
{{Main article|Starter motor}}
Early internal combustion engines were started by hand cranking.  Various types of starter motor were later developed.  These included:

* An auxiliary petrol engine for starting a larger petrol or diesel engine. The [[Hucks starter]] is an example
* Cartridge starters, such as the [[Coffman engine starter]], which used a device like a blank [[shotgun]] cartridge. These were popular for [[aircraft engine]]s
* [[Air start system|Pneumatic starters]]
* Hydraulic starters
* [[Starter (engine)|Electric starters]]

Electric starters are now almost universal for small and medium-sized engines, while pneumatic starters are used for large engines.

==Modern vs. historical piston engines==
The first piston engines did not have compression, but ran on an air-fuel mixture sucked or blown in during the first part of the intake stroke. The most significant distinction between '''modern internal combustion engines''' and the early designs is the use of [[compression (physical)|compression]] of the fuel charge prior to combustion.

The problem of ignition of fuel was handled in early engines with an open flame and a sliding gate.  To obtain a faster engine speed Daimler adopted a Hot Tube ignition which allowed 600&amp;nbsp;rpm immediately in his 1883 horizontal cylinder engine and very soon after over 900&amp;nbsp;rpm.  Most of the engines of that time could not exceed 200&amp;nbsp;rpm due to their ignition and induction systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supercars.net/forum/threads/1883-high-speed-engine-with-hot-tube-ignition.19553/|title=1883: High-speed engine with hot-tube ignition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first practical engine, Lenoir's, ran on illuminating gas (coal gas).  It wasn't until 1883, that Daimler created an engine that ran on liquid petroleum, a fuel called Ligroin which has a chemical makeup of Hexane-N.  The fuel is also known as petroleum naptha.

Otto's first engines were push engines which produced a push through the entire stroke (like a Diesel).  Daimler's engines produced a rapid pulse, more suitable for mobile engine use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4555">'''Holoplankton''' are organisms that are [[plankton|planktic]] (they live in the water column and cannot swim against a current) for their entire life cycle. Examples of holoplankton include some [[diatom]]s, [[radiolarian]]s, some [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[foraminifera]], [[amphipod]]s, [[krill]], [[copepod]]s, and [[salp]]s, as well as some [[gastropod]] mollusk species. Holoplankton dwell in the [[pelagic zone]] as opposed to the [[benthic zone]].&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Genny|title=Marine Plankton|url=http://marinebio.net/marinescience/03ecology/mlplankton.htm|work=Marine Science|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holoplankton include both [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] and vary in size. The most common plankton are [[protist]]s.&lt;ref name=Talks&gt;{{cite web|last=Talks|first=Ted|title=Zooplankton|url=http://marinebio.org/oceans/zooplankton.asp|work=Marine Life/Marine Invertebrates|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==
Holoplankton have unique traits that make reproduction in the water column possible. Both [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]] and [[Asexual reproduction|asexual]] reproduction are used depending on the type of plankton. Some invertebrate holoplankton release sperm into the water column which are then taken up by the females for fertilization. Other species release both sperm and egg to increase the likelihood of fertilization. Environmental, mechanical, or chemical cues can all trigger this release.&lt;ref name=Reproduction&gt;{{cite web|title=Reproduction in the Plankton|url=http://depts.washington.edu/fhl/zoo432/plankton/plreproduction/reproduction.html|work=Plankton|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diatoms are single celled phytoplankton that can occur as individuals or as long chains. They can reproduce sexually and asexually.&lt;ref name=Pierson&gt;{{cite web|last=Pierson|first=James|title=What is Plankton|url=http://www.hpl.umces.edu/~jpierson/plankton.html|work=Plankton|publisher=University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Diatoms are important oxygen producers and are usually the first step in the food chain.&lt;ref name=Anderson /&gt;

Copepods are small holoplanktonic crustaceans that swim using their hind legs and antennae.&lt;ref name=Talks/&gt;

==Defenses==
Because of their small size and sluggish swimming abilities, holoplanktonic species have made certain specialized adaptations and in some cases are equipped with special defenses.

[[Image:ArtificalTexture.png|thumb|right|alt=Artificial texture example.|Artificial texture example.]]
[[Image:NaturalTexture.png|thumb|right|alt=Natural texture example.|Natural texture example.]]

An '''image texture''' is a set of metrics calculated in image processing designed to quantify the perceived texture of an image. Image texture gives us information about the spatial arrangement of color or intensities in an image or selected region of an image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda Shapiro|Linda G. Shapiro]] and George C. Stockman, ''Computer Vision'', Upper Saddle River: Prentice&amp;ndash;Hall, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Image textures can be artificially created or found in natural scenes captured in an image. Image textures are one way that can be used to help in [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] or classification of images. For more accurate segmentation the most useful features are spatial frequency and an average grey level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13839/segmentaciya_nesfokusirovannyh_oblasteyna_2D-izobrazheniyah_poverhnostey_s_ispolzovaniemteksturnyh_priznakov.htm|title=Out-of-focus region segmentation of 2D surface images with the use of texture features.|author1=Trambitskiy K.V. |author2=Anding K. |author3=Polte G.A. |author4=Garten D. |author5=Musalimov V.M. |journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=5|pages=796–802|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;     To analyze an image texture in computer graphics, there are two ways to approach the issue: Structured Approach and Statistical Approach.

==Structured Approach==
A structured approach sees an image texture as a set of primitive [[Texel (graphics)|texels]] in some regular or repeated pattern. This works well when analyzing artificial textures.

To obtain a structured description a characterization of the spatial relationship of the texels is gathered by using [[Voronoi tessellation]] of the texels.

==Statistical Approach==
A statistical approach sees an image texture as a quantitative measure of the arrangement of intensities in a region. In general this approach is easier to compute and is more widely used, since natural textures are made of patterns of irregular subelements.

===Edge Detection===
The use of edge detection is to determine the number of edge pixels in a specified region, helps determine a characteristic of texture complexity. After edges have been found the direction of the edges can also be applied as a characteristic of texture and can be useful in determining patterns in the texture. These directions can be represented as an average or in a histogram.

Consider a region with N pixels. the gradient-based edge detector is applied to this region by producing two outputs for each pixel p: the gradient magnitude Mag(p) and the gradient direction Dir(p). The edgeness per unit area can be defined by &lt;math&gt;F_{edgeness}=\frac{|\{p | Mag(p) &gt; T\}|}{N}&lt;/math&gt; for some threshold T.

To include orientation with edgeness we can use histograms for both gradient magnitude and gradient direction. Let H&lt;sub&gt;mag&lt;/sub&gt;(R) denote the normalized histogram of gradient magnitudes of region R, and let H&lt;sub&gt;dir&lt;/sub&gt;(R) denote the normalized histogram of gradient orientations of region R. Both are normalized according to the size N&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; Then &lt;math&gt;F_{mag,dir}=(H_{mag}(R), H_{dir}(R))&lt;/math&gt; is a quantitative texture description of region R.

===Co-occurrence Matrices===
The [[co-occurrence matrix]] captures numerical features of a texture using spatial relations of similar gray tones.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Haralick, K. Shanmugam, and Its'hak Dinstein, "Textural Features for Image Classification", IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 1973, SMC-3 (6): 610–621&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical features computed from the co-occurrence matrix can be used to represent, compare, and classify textures. The following are a subset of standard features derivable from a normalized co-occurrence matrix:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 Angular \text{ } 2nd \text{ } Moment &amp;= \sum_{i} \sum_{j} p[i,j]^{2}\\
 Contrast &amp;=   \sum_{i=1}^{Ng} \sum_{j=1}^{Ng} n^{2} p[i,j]  \text{, where } |i-j|=n\\
 Correlation &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{Ng} \sum_{j=1}^{Ng}(ij)p[i,j] - \mu_x \mu_y}{\sigma_x \sigma_y} \\
 Entropy &amp;= -\sum_{i}\sum_{j} p[i,j] ln(p[i,j])\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p[i,j]&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;[i,j]&lt;/math&gt;th entry in a gray-tone spatial dependence matrix, and Ng is the number of distinct gray-levels in the quantized image.

One negative aspect of the co-occurrence matrix is that the extracted features do not necessarily correspond to visual perception.

===Laws Texture Energy Measures===
Another approach is to use local masks to detect various types of texture features. Laws&lt;ref&gt;K. Laws "Textured Image Segmentation", Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Southern California, January 1980&lt;/ref&gt; originally used four vectors representing texture features to create sixteen 2D masks from the outer products of the pairs of vectors.  The four vectors and relevant features were as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;
 L5  =  [ +1  +4  6  +4  +1 ]  (Level)
 E5  =  [ -1  -2  0  +2  +1 ]  (Edge)
 S5  =  [ -1   0  2   0  -1 ]  (Spot)
 R5  =  [ +1  -4  6  -4  +1 ]  (Ripple)
&lt;/pre&gt;
To these 4, a fifth is sometimes added:&lt;ref&gt;A. Meyer-Bäse, "Pattern Recognition for Medical Imaging", Academic Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 W5  =  [ -1  +2  0  -2  +1 ]  (Wave)
&lt;/pre&gt;
From Laws' 4 vectors, 16 5x5 "energy maps" are then filtered down to 9 in order to remove certain symmetric pairs. For instance, L5E5 measures vertical edge content and E5L5 measures horizontal edge content. The average of these two measures is the "edginess" of the content.  The resulting 9 maps used by Laws are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse576/book/ch7.pdf|title=CSE576: Computer Vision: Chapter 7|last=|first=|publisher=University of Washington|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=9–10|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
L5E5/E5L5
L5R5/R5L5
E5S5/S5E5
S5S5
R5R5
L5S5/S5L5
E5E5
E5R5/R5E5
S5R5/R5S5
&lt;/pre&gt;
Running each of these nine maps over an image to create a new image of the value of the origin ([2,2]) results in 9 "energy maps," or conceptually an image with each pixel associated with a vector of 9 texture attributes.

===Autocorrelation and Power Spectrum===
The autocorrelation function of an image can be used to detect repetitive patterns of textures.

==Texture Segmentation==
The use of image texture can be used as a description for regions into segments. There are two main types of [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] based on image texture, region based and boundary based. Though image texture is not a perfect measure for [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] it is used along with other measures, such as color, that helps solve segmenting in image.

===Region Based===
Attempts to group or cluster pixels based on texture properties.

===Boundary Based===
Attempts to group or cluster pixels based on edges between pixels that come from different texture properties.

{{main|Mediterranean Basin|Altitudinal zonation}}

The climate and ecology of land immediately surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]] is influenced by several factors. Overall, the land has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The climate induces characteristic [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] vegetation. Plant life immediately near the Mediterranean is in the Mediterranean Floristic region, while mountainous areas further from the sea supports the Sub-Mediterranean Floristic province.

An important factor in the local climate and ecology of the lands in the Mediterranean basin is the elevation: an increase of elevation by {{convert|1000|m|ft}} causes the average air temperature to drop by 5 C/ 9 F and decreases the amount of water that can be held by the atmosphere by 30%. This decrease in temperature and increase in rainfall result in altitudinal zonation, where the land can be divided into [[life zones]] of similar climate and ecology, depending on elevation.

Mediterranean vegetation shows a variety of ecological adaptations to hot and dry summer conditions. As Mediterranean vegetation differ both in species and composition from temperate vegetation, ecologists use special terminology for the Mediterranean altitudinal zonation: 
* Eu-mediterranean belt: 20- 16&amp;nbsp;°C (avg annual temperature)
* Sub-mediterranean belt: 15- 12&amp;nbsp;°C
* Hilly region: 11- 8&amp;nbsp;°C
* Mountainous belt: 7- 4&amp;nbsp;°C
* Alpine belt: 3- 0&amp;nbsp;°C
* Subnival belt: 0- minus 4&amp;nbsp;°C &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Even within the Mediterranean Basin, differences in aridity alter the life zones as a function of elevation. For example, the wetter [[Maritime Alps|Maritime]] and [[Dinaric Alps]] have a ''North-Mediterranean'' zonation pattern, while the southern [[Apennine Mountains]] and the Spanish [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] have a moderate ''Eu-Mediterranean'' zonation pattern. Finally, the drier [[Atlas Mountains]] of Africa and [[Taurus Mountains]] of the Near East have a ''Xero-Mediterranean'' pattern.&lt;ref name="Horvat et al."&gt;{{cite book

==Sierra Nevada of Spain==
The [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] of central [[Spain]] is an example of eu-mediterranean zonation arising from moderate aridity. The Sierra Nevada lie in the [[Iberian conifer forests]] ecoregion, which contain conifers above {{convert|1900|m|ft}} elevation, with mixed oak woodland below.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa1208|name=Iberian conifer forests|accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base of the mountains have a [[continental Mediterranean climate]], which gets progressively cooler as the elevation increases:
* '''[[Continental Mediterranean climate|Thermomediterranean zone]]''' (Lowland); under {{convert|700|m|ft}} elevation. Summers are hot here and winters almost nonexistent. This zone is mostly used for agriculture, but studies say Mastic (''[[Pistacia lentiscus]]''), Common Juniper (''[[Juniperus communis]]''), (''[[Aristolochia]] baetica'') and Mediterranean Smilax or Common Smilax (''[[Smilax]] aspera'') would normally grow here. Rosemary (''[[Rosmarinus officinalis]]''), Purret (''[[Ulex]] parviflorus'') and Gum Rockrose (''[[Cistus ladanifer]]'') are present on poor soils or after forest fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

* '''Mesomediterranean zone''' (Submontane) {{convert|700|to|1300|m|ft}} elevation. The summers are here still hot but frosts are normal in the winters. In this zone Mastic (''[[Pistacia lentiscus]]''), wild [[Olive]] (''Olea europaea'') and Mediterranean [[Smilax]] or Common Smilax (''Smilax aspera'') grow. Poor sandy soils have few species with the [[Holm Oak]] (''Quercus ilex''), the Common Junipers, (''[[Juniperus communis]]''), ''Daphne gnidium'' and Etruscan honeysuckle (''[[Lonicera etrusca]]'').
* '''Supramediterranean zone''' (Mid-Montane) {{convert|1300|to|1900|m|ft}} elevation. The summers are here temperate and frosts and snow are frequent in winter. ''Quercus pyrenaica'' predominates, Portuguese Oak ([[Quercus faginea]]) and [[maple]] appear too; these three species make up the [[forest]]. More frequent are the [[Sessile Oak]]s (''Quercus petraea'') between 1,300 and 1,750 m. The Sessile Oaks are dominated by the [[Holm Oak]]s (Quercus ilex) and, depending on soil and altitude, by bushes as [[Common Juniper]] (''Juniperus oxycedrus''), barberry (''Berberis hispanica''), (''[[Daphne]] gnidium''), Butcher's broom (''[[Ruscus aculeatus]]'') and Common Hawthorn (''[[Crataegus monogyna]]'') over basic soils.
* '''Oromediterranean zone''' (Subalpine) {{convert|1900|to|2700|m|ft}} elevation. In this zone, coniferous plants and sparse ''[[Juniperus thurifera]]'' appear. The vegetation is composed by trees and bushes ([[Scots Pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris''), [[Savin Juniper]] (''Juniperus sabina''), ''[[Juniperus communis]] subsp. hemisphaerica'', ''[[Prunus ramburii]]'') and other bushes (''Vella spinosa'', ''Erinacea anthyllis'', ''Bupleurum spinosum''). On better soils the Common Juniper, ''[[Juniperus communis]]'' and ''[[Cytisus]]'' appears, forming communities with ''Arenaria imbricata'', ''Festuca indigesta''. The endemic flora is present too: ''Genista versicolor'', ''Arenaria pungens'', ''Potentilla nevadensis''.
* '''Cryo-oromediterranean zone''' (Alpine); {{convert|2600|to|2800|m|ft}} elevation. [[Woody plant|Ligneous plants]] can not grow here because of the seasonal dryness typical of the Mediterranean climate and the presence of snow for more than 8 months. The vegetation has similarities to the Arctic [[tundra]], with the Mat-grass (''Nardus stricta'') as the most common species.

'''''Material World''''' was a weekly science magazine programme on [[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast on a Thursday afternoon. The programme's regular presenter was [[Quentin Cooper]], with contributions from scientists researching areas under discussion in each programme.

==History==
The programme began as ''The Material World'' in April 1998.  It was presented by [[Trevor Phillips]], a chemistry graduate of [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]]. In September 2000 Phillips was told that he could no longer work at the BBC due to his close links with the Labour Party, which broke BBC rules of impartiality. He was one of the few regular black broadcasters on Radio 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/sep/24/uk.labour1| title=BBC bans Trevor Phillips for political link| newspaper=[[The Guardian]]| date=24 September 2000| first=Kamal| last=Ahmed| author-link=Kamal Ahmed (journalist) |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was presented by Quentin Cooper from 2000 to its end in 2013.

Material World was one of the BBC's main conduits for up-to-date scientific news, along with ''[[Frontiers (radio programme)|Frontiers]]'', ''[[Science in Action – BBC World Service Radio|Science in Action]]'', and ''[[Bang Goes the Theory]]''.

From 5 April 2010 the programme was repeated on a Monday evening at 21.00, in the former slot of ''[[Costing the Earth]]''. For a short time, when programmes on [[BBC Radio 5 Live|5 Live]] began [[Streaming media|webstreaming]] with video, ''Material World'' was also [[webcast]].

On 14 June 2013 it was announced that the show was to be cancelled, to be replaced by a new show, ''Inside Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/posts/Introducing-Inside-Science |title = Introducing Inside Science |last = Bakaya |first = Mohit |date = 14 June 2013 |accessdate= 20 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last programme presented by Quentin Cooper was broadcast on 20 June 2013 with the final episode airing a week later on 27 June 2013, presented by Gareth Mitchell.

==Structure==
A typical episode programme covered three or four topics, giving each 7-10 minutes. For many years the programme was divided into two sections of fifteen minutes on separate topics.{{fact|date=September 2015}} It took the form of interviewing a guest scientist or engineer.  Cooper often ended the programme with a terrible scientific [[pun]].

Many past programmes are available for online listening via the programme's website. Some sequential sets of programmes were made in collaboration with the [[Open University]].

'''Montane ecosystems''' refers to any [[ecosystem]] found in [[mountain]]s. These ecosystems are strongly affected by [[alpine climate|climate]], which gets [[lapse rate|colder as elevation increases]]. They are stratified according to elevation. Dense [[forest]]s are common at moderate elevations. However, as the elevation increases, the climate becomes harsher, and the plant community transitions to grasslands or [[tundra]].

==Life zones==
[[File:Mountain-birch-Trollheimen.jpg|thumb|A stand of [[Betula pubescens|mountain birch]] at around 750&amp;nbsp;m in [[Trollheimen]], typical of [[Scandinavia]]n subalpine forests]]

As elevation increases, the [[alpine climate|climate becomes cooler]], due to a decrease in [[atmospheric pressure]] and the [[adiabatic cooling]] of airmasses.&lt;ref name=goodywilson&gt;{{cite book |first1=Richard M. |last1=Goody |first2=James C.G. |last2=Walker |title=Atmospheres |chapter=Atmospheric Temperatures |chapterurl=http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/GoodyWalker/AtmosCh3sm.pdf |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1972 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729075851/http://lasp.colorado.edu/~bagenal/3720/GoodyWalker/AtmosCh3sm.pdf |archivedate=29 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in climate by moving up 100&amp;nbsp;meters on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80&amp;nbsp;kilometers (45&amp;nbsp;miles or 0.75° of [[latitude]]) towards the nearest pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blyth |first1=S. |last2=Groombridge |first2=B. |last3=Lysenko |first3=I. |last4=Miles |first4=L. |last5=Newton |first5=A. |url=http://www.unep-wcmc.org/mountains/mountain_watch/pdfs/WholeReport.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080511044709/http://www.unep-wcmc.org/mountains/mountain_watch/pdfs/WholeReport.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 May 2008 |title=Mountain Watch |year=2002 |publisher=UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Cambridge, UK |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristic flora and fauna in the mountains tend to strongly depend on elevation, because of the change in climate. This dependency causes [[life zone]]s to form: bands of similar ecosystems at similar altitude.

One of the typical life zones on mountains is the montane forest: at moderate elevations, the rainfall and temperate climate encourages dense forests to grow. [[Holdridge life zone|Holdridge]] defines the climate of montane forest as having a biotemperature of between {{convert|6|and|12|C|F}}, where biotemperature is the mean temperature considering temperatures below {{convert|0|C|F}} to be {{convert|0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=lugo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lugo|first1=Ariel E.|first2=Sandra L.|last2=Brown|first3=Rusty|last3=Dodson|first4=Tom S.|last4=Smith|first5=Hank H.|last5=Shugart|year=1999|title=The Holdridge Life Zones of the conterminous United States in relation to ecosystem mapping|journal=Journal of Biogeography|volume=26|pages=1025–1038|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/global/iitf/pubs/ja_iitf_1999_lugo002.pdf|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1999.00329.x|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the elevation of the montane forest, the trees thin out in the subalpine zone, become twisted [[krummholz]], and eventually fail to grow. Therefore, Montane forests often contain trees with twisted trunks. This phenomenon is observed due to the increase in the wind strength with the elevation.The elevation where trees fail to grow is called the [[tree line]]. The biotemperature of the subalpine zone is between {{convert|3|and|6|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=lugo/&gt;

Above the tree line the ecosystem is called the alpine zone or [[alpine tundra]], dominated by grasses and low-growing shrubs. The biotemperature of the alpine zone is between {{convert|1.5|and|3|C|F}}. Many different plant species live in the alpine environment, including  [[perennial grass]]es, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]],  [[forb]]s, [[cushion plant]]s, [[moss]]es, and [[lichen]]s.&lt;ref name=functional&gt;{{Cite book

Alpine plants display adaptations such as rosette structures, waxy surfaces, and hairy leaves. Because of the common characteristics of these zones, the [[World Wildlife Fund]] groups a set of related [[ecoregions]] into the "[[montane grassland and shrubland]]" biome.

Climates with biotemperatures below {{convert|1.5|C|F|0}} tend to consist purely of rock and ice.&lt;ref name=lugo/&gt;

==Montane forest==
[[File:Overlooking Waimea Canyon.jpg|thumb|[[Waimea Canyon]], Hawaii is known for its montane [[vegetation]].]]
Montane forests occur between the [[submontane zone]] and the subalpine zone. The elevation at which one habitat changes to another varies across the globe, particularly by [[latitude]]. The upper limit of montane forests, the [[Tree line|forest line or timberline]], is often marked by a change to hardier species that occur in less dense stands.&lt;ref name=Price/&gt; For example, in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] of [[California]], the montane forest has dense stands of [[lodgepole pine]] and [[red fir]], while the [[Sierra Nevada subalpine zone]] contains sparse stands of [[whitebark pine]].&lt;ref name="Rundel"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rundel|first=P.W.|author2=D.

Montane forests differ from lowland forests in the same area.&lt;ref name=Nagy&gt;{{cite book|title=The biology of alpine habitats|first1=László|last1=Nagy|first2=Georg|last2=Grabherr|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate of montane forests is colder than lowland climate at the same latitude, so the montane forests often have species typical of higher-latitude lowland forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Perry | first = David A. | year = 1994 | title = Forest Ecosystems | publisher = JHU Press | isbn = 0-8018-4987-X | page = 49 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWNtHLz3fXYC&amp;pg=PA55 | accessdate = 2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Humans can disturb montane forests through [[forestry]] and [[agriculture]].&lt;ref name=Nagy/&gt; On isolated mountains, montane forests surrounded by treeless dry regions are typical "[[sky island]]" ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Albert | first1 = James S. | last2 = Reis | first2 = Roberto E. | year = 2011 | title = Historical Biogeography of Neotropical Freshwater Fishes | publisher = University of California Press | isbn = 0-520-26868-7 | page = 311 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_Suu7a-ERdMC&amp;pg=PA311 | accessdate = 2012-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperate climate ===
[[File:PitsundaPineGrove.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Pine forest in [[Abkhazia]]]]

Montane forests in temperate climate are typically one of [[temperate coniferous forest]] or [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]], forest types that are well known from northern Europe, northern United States, and southern Canada. The trees are, however, often not identical to those found further north: geology and climate causes different related species to occur in montane forests.

Montane forests around the world tend to be more species-rich than those in Europe, because major mountain chains in Europe are oriented east-west.


Montane forests in temperate climate occur in Europe (the [[Alps]], [[Carpathians]], [[Caucasus]] and more), in North America ([[Cascade Range]], [[Klamath-Siskiyou]], [[Appalachians]] and more), south-western South America, [[New Zealand]] and [[Himalaya]].

=== Mediterranean climate ===
[[File:Chase khar - چاسه خار (3).jpg|thumb|right|Iranian oak scrub in the [[Zagros Mountains]]]]
Montane forests in [[Mediterranean climate]] are warm and dry except in winter, when they are relatively wet and mild. These forests are typically mixed conifer and broadleaf forests, with only a few conifer species. [[Pine]] and [[Juniper]] are typical trees found in Mediterranean montane forests. The broadleaf trees show more variety and are often evergreen, e.g. evergreen [[Oak]].

This type of forest is found in the [[Mediterranean Basin]], [[North Africa]], [[Mexico]] and the [[southwestern US]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]].

=== Subtropical and tropical climate ===
[[File:Forest on Gunung Batu Brinchang, Malaysia.jpg|thumb|right|Tropical montane forest at around 2,000&amp;nbsp;m in [[Malaysia]]]]

In the tropics, montane forests can consist of [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|broadleaf forest]] in addition to [[tropical coniferous forest|coniferous forest]]. One example of a tropical montane forest is a [[cloud forest]], which gains its moisture from clouds and fog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mulligan | first = M. | title = Tropical Montane Cloud Forests: Science for Conservation and Management | editor = Bruijnzeel, L.

Mossy forests usually develop on the saddles of mountains, where moisture introduced by settling clouds is more effectively retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=C.M.|year=1997|title=[[Nepenthes of Borneo]]|publisher=Natural History Publications (Borneo)|location=Kota Kinabalu|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on latitude, the lower limit of montane rainforests on large mountains is generally between {{convert|1500|and|2500|m|ft}} while the upper limit is usually from {{convert|2400|to|3300|m|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruijnzee|first1=L.A.|first2=E.

==Subalpine zone==
[[Image:Abies lasiocarpa 7458.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Subalpine Fir]] in [[Mount Rainier National Park]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States]]

The subalpine zone is the [[life zone|biotic zone]] immediately below the [[tree line]] around the world. In tropical regions of [[Southeast Asia]] the tree line may be above {{convert|4000|m|ft|abbr=on}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasco |first=F. |last2=Whitmore |first2=T.C. |last3=Gers |first3=C. |year=2000 |title=A framework for the worldwide comparison of tropical woody vegetation types |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=95 |issue=2 |pages=175–189 |url=http://www.ecolab.ups-tlse.fr/IMG/pdf/BC_Blasco_et_al.2000.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6APmLJTrW?url=http://www.ecolab.ups-tlse.fr/IMG/pdf/BC_Blasco_et_al.2000.pdf |archivedate=2012-09-04 |accessdate=2012-03-11 |doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00032-X |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |df= }} p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Scotland it may be as low as {{convert|450|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Grace |first=John |last2=Berninger |first2=Frank |last3=Nagy |first3=Laszlo |year=2002 |title=Impacts of Climate Change on the Tree Line |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=90 |issue=4 |pages=537–544 |doi=10.1093/aob/mcf222 |pmid=12324278 |pmc=4240388 }} fig. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Species that occur in this zone depend on the location of the zone on the Earth, for example, [[snow gum]] in Australia, or [[subalpine larch]], [[mountain hemlock]] and [[subalpine fir]] in western North America.

Trees in the subalpine zone often become [[krummholz]], that is, crooked wood, stunted and twisted in form. At tree line, tree seedlings may germinate on the [[Windward and leeward|lee side]] of rocks and grow only as high as the rock provides wind protection. Further growth is more horizontal than vertical, and additional rooting may occur where branches contact the soil. Snow cover may protect krummholz trees during the winter, but branches higher than wind-shelters or snow cover are usually destroyed. Well-established krummholz trees may be several hundred to a thousand years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/romo/naturescience/subalpine_ecosystem.htm|title=Subalpine ecosystem|work=Rocky Mountain National Park|publisher=U.S. National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Montane grasslands and shrublands|Meadows]] may be found in the subalpine zone. [[Tuolumne Meadows]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] of [[California]], is an example of a subalpine meadow.

Example subalpine zones around the world include the [[French Prealps]] in Europe, the [[Sierra Nevada subalpine zone|Sierra Nevada]] and [[Rocky Mountains subalpine zone|Rocky Mountain]] subalpine zones in North America, and subalpine forests in the [[Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests|eastern Himalaya]], [[Western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests|western Himalaya]], and [[Hengduan Mountains subalpine conifer forests|Hengduan mountains]] of Asia.

==Alpine grasslands and tundra==
{{main|Alpine tundra|Montane grassland and shrubland|Alpine plant}}
[[File:The Triplets from Sahale Arm.jpg|right|thumb|Alpine flora near [[Cascade Pass]]]]
[[Image:GlarusAlps.jpg|thumb|An alpine [[Bog|mire]] in the [[Swiss Alps]]]]
Alpine grasslands and tundra lie above the tree line, in a world of intense radiation, wind, cold, snow, and ice. As a consequence, alpine vegetation is close to the ground and consists mainly of [[perennial grass]]es, [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], and [[forb]]s. Annual plants are rare in this ecosystem and usually are only a few inches tall, with weak root systems.&lt;ref name=blm&gt;{{Include-USGov|agency=[[Bureau of Land Management]]|source={{cite web|url=http://www.blm.gov/wildlife/plan/WY/Alpine%20Tundra%20Grassland.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724070058/http://www.blm.gov/wildlife/plan/WY/Alpine%20Tundra%20Grassland.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-24|title=Grassland Habitat Group}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other common [[plant life-form]]s include [[prostrate shrub]]s, [[grass|graminoids]] forming  [[tussock (grass)|tussocks]], and [[cryptogams]], such as [[bryophytes]] and [[lichens]].&lt;ref name=functional/&gt;

Plants have adapted to the harsh alpine environment. [[Cushion plant]]s, looking like ground-hugging clumps of moss, escape the strong winds blowing a few inches above them. Many flowering plants of the alpine tundra have dense hairs on stems and leaves to provide wind protection or [[anthocyanin|red-colored pigments]] capable of converting the sun's light rays into heat. Some plants take two or more years to form flower buds, which survive the winter below the surface and then open and produce fruit with seeds in the few weeks of summer.&lt;ref name=rockymtn&gt;{{NPS|url=http://www.nps.gov/romo/naturescience/alpine_tundra_ecosystem.htm|article=Rocky Mountain National Park: Alpine Tundra Ecosystem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-flowering [[lichen]]s cling to rocks and soil. Their enclosed [[algae|algal cells]] can [[photosynthesize]] at any temperature above {{convert|0|C|F}}, and the outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water.

The adaptations for survival of drying winds and cold may make tundra vegetation seem very hardy, but in some respects the tundra is very fragile. Repeated footsteps often destroy tundra plants, leaving exposed soil to blow away, and recovery may take hundreds of years.&lt;ref name=rockymtn/&gt;

Alpine meadows form where sediments from the weathering of rocks has produced soils well-developed enough to support grasses and sedges. Alpine grasslands are common enough around the world to be categorized as a [[biome]] by the [[World Wildlife Fund]]. The biome, called "Montane grasslands and shrublands", often evolved as virtual islands, separated from other montane regions by warmer, lower elevation regions, and are frequently home to many distinctive and [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plants which evolved in response to the cool, wet [[climate]] and abundant sunlight.

The most extensive montane grasslands and shrublands occur in the [[Neotropic ecozone|Neotropic]] [[páramo]] of the [[Andes Mountains]]. This biome also occurs in the mountains of [[eastern Africa|east]] and [[central Africa]], [[Mount Kinabalu]] of [[Borneo]], highest elevations of the [[Western Ghats]] in South India and the Central Highlands of [[New Guinea]]. A unique feature of many wet tropical montane regions is the presence of giant rosette plants from a variety of plant families, such as ''[[Lobelia]]'' ([[Afrotropic]]), ''[[Puya (genus)|Puya]]'' ([[Neotropic]]), ''[[Cyathea]]'' ([[New Guinea]]), and ''[[Argyroxiphium]]'' ([[Hawaii]]).

Where conditions are drier, one finds montane grasslands, savannas, and woodlands, like the [[Ethiopian Highlands]], and montane [[steppe]]s, like the steppes of the [[Tibetan Plateau]].

'''New Genres''' is an [[artistic movement]] begun in the early 20th century.  The movement is marked by many notable artists who work with a variety of media such as [[video art]], [[body art]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[performance]], and [[sound art]].

==Definition==
New Genres art is commonly identified as [[installation art]], [[Video (disambiguation)|video]], [[film]], [[sound]], [[performance]], [[Digital media]], [[internet art]],&lt;ref&gt;Duron, Julian. Dot Forum: New Genre Art. Fecalface.com. http://www.fecalface.com/SF/component/content/article/138-dot-forum/1434-dot-forum-new-genre-art. Retrieved 2015-6-10.&lt;/ref&gt; [[hybrid genre|hybrid]] and [[emerging art forms]]. New Genres is a practice which begins with ideas and then moves to the appropriate form or media for that particular idea, sometimes inventing entirely new sites of [[cultural production]], new methodologies, technologies, or [[genres]] in the process. New Genres gives emphasis to questioning preconceived notions of the role of art in culture and its relationship to a specific form or [[List of artistic media|medium]].&lt;ref&gt;
University of California, Los Angeles. New Genres Homepage. http://www.art.ucla.edu/newgenres/. Retrieved 2015-6-10.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
While no recognized official date marks the beginning of the New Genre period, many{{quantify|date=September 2014}} believe that the early 20th-century work of the [[Dadaists]] and [[Futurists]] initiated this movement.  Their work laid a foundation for the experimental practice of New Genres.  Duchamp's "Fountain" (1917) introduced the idea of the [[readymade]] object: a non-art object which becomes viewed as art due to the intention and designation of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/492875/ready-made |title= ready-made (style of art) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new use of [[artistic power]] and questioning of the art object opened up the conceptual sphere of New Genres.  These discoveries illuminated the idea that art was possible outside the field of the classical genres like painting and sculpture.

To understand the movement of New Genres, it is important to look at the events occurring simultaneously in the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}  In the first half of the century, [[World War I]] broke out and caused devastation to much of Eastern Europe.  In America, the [[Great Depression]] caused a major economic crises that affected many parts of the world.  [[World War II]] quickly followed, splitting the world into two alliances: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]].  This war caused tremendous damage and introduced new tragedies into the world, such as the [[Holocaust]] and the first [[nuclear weapons]].

'''Oral microbiology''' is the study of the [[microorganism]]s (microbiota) of the oral cavity and their interactions between oral microorganisms or with the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Schwiertz | first = Andreas | title = Microbiota of the human body : implications in health and disease | publisher = Springer | location = Switzerland | year = 2016 | page= 45 |isbn = 978-3-319-31248-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The environment present in the human mouth allows the growth of characteristic microorganisms found there. It provides a source of water and nutrients, as well as a moderate temperature.&lt;ref name="Prescotts" /&gt; Resident microbes of the mouth adhere to the teeth and gums to resist mechanical flushing from the mouth to stomach where acid-sensitive microbes are destroyed by [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;ref name="Prescotts" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wang2014rev/&gt;

Anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity include: ''[[Actinomyces]]'', ''[[Arachnia]]'', ''[[Bacteroides]]'', ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'', ''[[Eubacterium]]'', ''[[Fusobacterium]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', ''[[Leptotrichi]]a'', ''[[Peptococcu]]s'', ''[[Peptostreptococcus]]'', ''[[Propionibacterium]]'', ''[[Selenomonas]]'', ''[[Treponema]]'', and ''[[Veillonella]]''.&lt;ref name="sutter"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1093/clinids/6.Supplement_1.S62 |last1 = Sutter|first1 = V.

Bacterial [[adhesion]] is particularly important for oral bacteria.

Oral bacteria have evolved mechanisms to sense their environment and evade or modify the host. Bacteria occupy the ecological niche provided by both the [[tooth]] surface and gingival [[epithelium]].  However, a highly efficient innate host defense system constantly monitors the bacterial colonization and prevents bacterial invasion of local tissues. A dynamic  equilibrium exists between [[dental plaque]] bacteria and the innate host defense system.&lt;ref name="AnthonyHRogers"/&gt;  Of particular interest is the role of oral microorganisms in the two major dental diseases: [[dental caries]] and [[periodontal disease]].&lt;ref name=AnthonyHRogers&gt;{{cite book | author = Rogers A H (editor). | title = Molecular Oral Microbiology | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 |  isbn =  978-1-904455-24-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, research has correlated poor oral heath and the resulting ability of the oral microbiota to invade the body to affect cardiac health as well as cognitive function.&lt;ref name=Noble2013rev&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Noble JM, Scarmeas N, Papapanou PN | title=Poor oral health as a chronic, potentially modifiable dementia risk factor: review of the literature. | journal=Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep | year= 2013 | volume= 13 | issue= 10 | pages= 384 | pmid=23963608 | doi=10.1007/s11910-013-0384-x | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=23963608  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmacol. Ther. | volume = 39 | issue = 8 | pages = 751–766 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24612332 | doi = 10.1111/apt.12665 | quote = In addition, GI fungal infection is reported even among those patients with normal immune status. Digestive system-related fungal infections may be induced by both commensal opportunistic fungi and exogenous pathogenic fungi.&amp;nbsp;... ''Candida'' sp. is also the most frequently identified species among patients with gastric IFI.&amp;nbsp;...  It was once believed that gastric acid could kill microbes entering the stomach and that the unique ecological environment of the stomach was not suitable for microbial colonisation or infection. However, several studies using culture-independent methods confirmed that large numbers of acid-resistant bacteria belonging to eight phyla and up to 120 species exist in the stomach, such as ''Streptococcus'' sp., ''Neisseria'' sp. and ''Lactobacillus'' sp. etc.&lt;sup&gt;26, 27&lt;/sup&gt; Furthermore, ''Candida albicans'' can grow well in highly acidic environments,&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt; and some genotypes may increase the severity of gastric mucosal lesions.&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity include: ''[[Actinomyces]]'', ''[[Arachnia]]'', ''[[Bacteroides]]'', ''[[Bifidobacterium]]'', ''[[Eubacterium]]'', ''[[Fusobacterium]]'', ''[[Lactobacillus]]'', ''[[Leptotrichi]]a'', ''[[Peptococcu]]s'', ''[[Peptostreptococcus]]'', ''[[Propionibacterium]]'', ''[[Selenomonas]]'', ''[[Treponema]]'', and ''[[Veillonella]]''.&lt;ref name="sutter"/&gt;
 
The oral cavity of the new-born baby does not contain bacteria but rapidly becomes colonized with bacteria such as ''[[Streptococcus salivarius]]''. With the appearance of the teeth during the first year colonization by ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus sanguinis]]'' occurs as these organisms  colonise the dental surface and gingiva. Other strains of streptococci adhere strongly to the gums and cheeks but not to the teeth. The [[gingival crevice]] area (supporting structures of the teeth) provides a habitat for a variety of anaerobic species. Bacteroides and [[spirochetes]] colonize the mouth around puberty.&lt;ref name="AnthonyHRogers"/&gt;

Of particular interest is the role of oral microorganisms in the two major dental diseases: [[dental caries]] and [[periodontal disease]].&lt;ref name=AnthonyHRogers/&gt;

===''Fusospirochetes''===
Spirochetes and fusiform [[fusobacteria|bacilli]] live as members of the normal microbiota in the mouth, but in the case of bleeding in the oral cavity, the bacteria can cause infection and diseases to oral cavity:
# Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis ([[ANUG]])
# Vincent angina with a membrane covering the throat area

===''Veillonella''===
Veillonella are [[gram-negative anaerobic cocci]]. It is thought that this species thrives in the acidic environment of caries and is thought to slow the development of dental caries. It converts the acidic products of other species to less acidic products.

===''Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans''===
''[[Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans]]'' is considered an oral pathogen due to its virulence factors, its association with localized aggressive [[periodontitis]] in young adolescents, and studies indicating that it can cause bone loss.&lt;ref name=fine&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Fine DH, etal |year=2008|chapter=Molecular Windows into the Pathogenic Properties of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans|title=Molecular Oral Microbiology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-24-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Lactobacillus''===
Some ''Lactobacillus'' species have been associated with dental cavities although these bacteria are normally symbiotic in humans and are found in the [[gut flora|gut microbiota]].&lt;ref name= LjunghWadstrom&gt;{{cite book |author= Ljungh A, Wadstrom T (editors)| year=2009 |title=Lactobacillus Molecular Biology: From Genomics to Probiotics | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-41-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dental plaque==
Dental plaque is the material that adheres to the teeth and consists of bacterial cells (mainly ''S. mutans'' and ''S. sanguis''), salivary polymers and bacterial extracellular products. Plaque is a  biofilm on the surfaces of the teeth. This accumulation of microorganisms subject the teeth and gingival tissues to high concentrations of bacterial metabolites which results in dental disease. If not taken care of, via brushing or flossing, the plaque can turn into [[Dental tartar|tartar]] (its hardened form) and lead to [[gingivitis]] or periodontal disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Willey JM, Sherwood L, Woolverton CJ, Prescott LM| year=2014 |title=Prescott's Microbiology | publisher=McGraw-Hill Education | isbn= 978-9-814581-56-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell–cell communication==
Most of the bacterial species found in the mouth belong to microbial communities, called [[biofilm]]s, a feature of which is inter-bacterial communication. Cell–cell contact is mediated by specific protein [[Bacterial adhesin|adhesin]]s and often, as in the case of inter-species aggregation, by complementary [[polysaccharide]] receptors. Another method of communication involves cell–cell signalling molecules, which are of two classes: those used for intra-species and those used for inter-species signalling. An example of intra-species communication is [[quorum sensing]]. Oral bacteria have been shown to produce small peptides, such as [[competence stimulating peptides]], which can help promote single-species biofilm formation. A common form of inter-species signalling is mediated by [[4,5-Dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione|4, 5-dihydroxy-2, 3-pentanedione]] (DPD), also known as [[autoinducer-2]] (Al-2).&lt;ref name=rickard&gt;{{cite book |author=Rickard A H|year=2008|chapter=Cell-cell Communication in Oral Microbial Communities |title=Molecular Oral Microbiology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-24-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaccination against oral infections==
In the case of dental caries, proteins involved in colonization of teeth by ''[[Streptococcus mutans]]'' can produce antibodies that inhibit the [[cariogenic]] process.&lt;ref name=hajishengallis&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Hajishengallis G, Russell MW|year=2008|chapter=Molecular Approaches to Vaccination against Oral Infections|title=Molecular Oral Microbiology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn= 978-1-904455-24-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other microbiota==
Bacteria species typically associated with the oral microbiota have been found to be present in women with [[bacterial vaginosis]].&lt;ref name="AfricaNel2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Africa|first1=Charlene|last2=Nel|first2=Janske|last3=Stemmet|first3=Megan|title=Anaerobes and Bacterial Vaginosis in Pregnancy: Virulence Factors Contributing to Vaginal Colonisation|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=11|issue=7|year=2014|pages=6979–7000|issn=1660-4601|doi=10.3390/ijerph110706979|pmid=25014248|pmc=4113856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genera of fungi that are frequently found in the mouth include ''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida]]'', ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Glomus (fungus)|Glomus]]'', ''[[Alternaria]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', and ''[[Cryptococcus]]'', among others.&lt;ref name="mycobiome"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cui L, Morris A, Ghedin E | title = The human mycobiome in health and disease | journal = Genome Med | volume = 5 | issue = 7 | pages = 63 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23899327 | pmc = 3978422 | doi = 10.1186/gm467 | quote = [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3978422/figure/F2/ Figure 2: Distribution of fungal genera in different body sites]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in non-oral disease==
Additionally, research has correlated poor oral heath and the resulting ability of the oral microbiota to invade the body to affect cardiac health as well as cognitive function.&lt;ref name=Noble2013rev/&gt;

** [[Office automation]] &amp;ndash;  the varied computer machinery and software used to digitally create, collect, store, manipulate, and relay office information needed for accomplishing basic tasks such as [[business process automation]] and [[robotic process automation]].

== Fields contributing to automation ==
* [[Cybernetics]] &amp;ndash;  the interdisciplinary study of the structure of regulatory systems.
* [[Cognitive science]] &amp;ndash;  interdisciplinary scientific study of the mind and its processes. It examines what cognition is, what it does and how it works.
* [[Robotics]] &amp;ndash;  the branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, structural disposition, manufacture and application of robots and computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing.

== History of automation ==

* [[Mass production#History|History of mass production]] &amp;ndash; Prerequisites of mass production were interchangeable parts, machine tools and power, especially in the form of electricity. Mass production was popularized in the 1910s and 1920s by Henry Ford's Ford Motor Company, which introduced electric motors to the then-well-known technique of chain or sequential production.
* [[Numerical control]] (NC) &amp;ndash;  refers to the automation of machine tools that are operated by abstractly programmed commands encoded on a storage medium, as opposed to controlled manually via handwheels or levers, or mechanically automated via cams alone.
* [[History of home automation]]

== Automated machines ==
* [[Machine to Machine]] &amp;ndash;
* [[OLE for process control]] (OPC) &amp;ndash; 
* [[Process control]] &amp;ndash;  a statistics and engineering discipline that deals with architectures, mechanisms and algorithms for maintaining the output of a specific process within a desired range.
* [[Run Book Automation]] (RBA) &amp;ndash; 
* [[Robot]] &amp;ndash;  a mechanical or virtual intelligent agent that can perform tasks automatically or with guidance, typically by remote control.

== Automated machine components ==
* [[Artificial intelligence]] &amp;ndash; the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science that aims to create it.
* [[Friendly artificial intelligence]] &amp;ndash; an artificial intelligence that has a positive rather than negative effect on humanity, and the field of knowledge required to build such an artificial intelligence.

===Automation tools===

* [[Artificial neural network]] (ANN) &amp;ndash;  mathematical model or computational model that is inspired by the structure or functional aspects of biological neural networks.
* [[Human machine interface]] (HMI) &amp;ndash; operator level  local control panel that control monitors the field devices,
* [[Laboratory information management system]] (LIMS) &amp;ndash;  software package that offers a set of key features that support a modern laboratory's operations.
* [[Industrial control system]] &amp;ndash; encompasses several types of control systems used in industrial production, including supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other smaller control system configurations such as skid-mounted programmable logic controllers (PLC) often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures.
** [[Distributed control system]] (DCS) &amp;ndash; control system usually of a manufacturing system, process or any kind of dynamic system, in which the controller elements are not central in location (like the brain) but are distributed throughout the system with each component sub-system controlled by one or more controllers.
** Manufacturing execution system (MES) &amp;ndash; system that manages manufacturing operations in a factory, including management of resources, scheduling production processes, dispatching production orders, execution of production orders, etc.
** [[Programmable automation controller]] (PAC) &amp;ndash; digital computer used for automation of electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures.
** [[Programmable logic controller]] (PLC)A Programmable Logic Controller, PLC or Programmable Controller is a digital computer used for automation of electromechanical processes, such as control of machinery on factory assembly lines, amusement rides, or light fixtures. The abbreviation "PLC" and the term "Programmable Logic Controller" are registered trademarks of the Allen-Bradley Company (Rockwell Automation). PLCs are used in many industries and machines. Unlike general-purpose computers, the PLC is designed for multiple inputs and output arrangements, extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise, and resistance to vibration and impact. Programs to control machine operation are typically stored in battery-backed-up or non-volatile memory. A PLC is an example of a hard real time system since output results must be produced in response to input conditions within a limited time, otherwise unintended operation will result. &amp;ndash;
** [[Supervisory control and data acquisition]] (SCADA) &amp;ndash; generally refers to industrial control systems (ICS): computer systems that monitor and control industrial, infrastructure, or facility-based processes, as described below:* Industrial processes include those of manufacturing, production, power generation, fabrication, and refining, and may run in continuous, batch, repetitive, or discrete modes.
* [[Simulation#Engineering Technology simulation or Process simulation]] &amp;ndash;

==Social movements ==

Automation-related social movement &amp;ndash; a movement that advocates semi- or fully automatic systems to provide for human needs globally. For example, automation of farming and food distribution throughout the world so that no one will go hungry. One goal is to automate all mundane labor, to free humans to engage in more creative activities (or less work).
* The [[Technocracy movement]] &amp;ndash; social movement active from the Great Depression (1930s) to date that proposes replacing politicians and businesspeople with scientists and engineers who have the technical expertise to manage the economy.
* [[The Zeitgeist Movement]] &amp;ndash;  movement advocating the replacement of the market economy with an economy in which all resources are equitably, commonly and sustainably shared.

== Automation in the future ==

'''Paul Smith's College''' is a private college located in [[Paul Smiths, New York|Paul Smiths, N.Y.]] It is the only four-year institution of higher education within the [[Adirondack State Park|Adirondack Park]]. Paul Smith's College offers both two- and four-year programs in many fields, including natural resources, environmental science, fisheries and wildlife science, forestry, recreation, biology, hotel and restaurant management, culinary arts and business. Its 14,000-acre campus is one of the largest college campuses in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/paul-smiths-college-2795|title=Paul Smith's College - Profile, Rankings and Data {{!}} US News Best Colleges|last=|first=|date=|website=US News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517212910/https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/paul-smiths-college-2795|archive-date=2017-05-17|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1,000 students attend each year.

==History==
Paul Smith's College was founded through a bequest of Phelps Smith, son of [[Apollos Smith]], whose [[Paul Smith's Hotel]], built in 1859, was the most famous wilderness resort of its era. The first class was matriculated in 1946, and was loosely based on the original hotel's business model. Along with the money to start a school, Phelps also left more than 20,000 acres (80&amp;nbsp;km²) of land.  Paul Smith's is located northwest of [[Saranac Lake, New York|Saranac Lake, N]].Y., in the hamlet of Paul Smiths in the Town of [[Brighton, Franklin County, New York|Brighton]].

In 2015 Joan Weill, a former college trustee with a long history of philanthropy benefiting the college, offered a $20 million donation on the condition that the institution change its name to Joan Weill-Paul Smith's College, a change that would have violated Phelps Smith's founding bequest, which required that the school be "forever known" as Paul Smith's College of Arts and Sciences. Justice John T. Ellis of the New York State Supreme Court ruled that the college could not be renamed, and the proposed donation was withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Academics ==

Paul Smith's College has a long tradition of providing hands-on education with coursework applied in a variety of fields. For example, students in the Forestry program participate in professional timber harvest operations.

Classroom space is primarily located at Pickett Hall, Cantwell Hall, and Freer Science Hall. Auxiliary areas include The Joan Weill Adirondack Library, the campus' sawmill, the Saunders Sports Complex, the Joan Weill Student Center and the Paul Smith's College VIC.

Two on-campus restaurants, the Adirondack Palm and the St. Regis Cafe, are staffed by students and open to the public.

Paul Smith's Fall 2015 acceptance rate was 98% and it was ranked #14 in Regional Colleges North in the 2019 ranking by U.S. News &amp; World Report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/paul-smiths-college-2795|title=Paul Smith's College|last=|first=|date=|website=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/|publisher=U.S. News &amp; World Report L.P.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517212910/https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/paul-smiths-college-2795|archive-date=2017-05-17|dead-url=yes|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus life ==
[[Image:Lower St Regis Lake from Paul Smiths College.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lower St. Regis Lake]] from the College]]

Most of the college population lives on campus.  Residence halls are divided by class. Freshmen halls include Lydia Martin Smith Hall, Currier Hall, and Lakeside Hall. Incoming transfer students are housed in Franklin Hall. Upperclassmen share Essex, Clinton, Lambert, Blum House, Overlook, Saratoga, Alumni, Upper St. Regis, Lower St. Regis, and Hillside halls. Overlook Hall was opened in 2011 as a [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED-certified]] "green" dorm for upper-classmen. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulsmiths.edu/slh/residence_life/housing.php?type=current |title=Residence Hall Living |publisher=Paulsmiths.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219195326/http://www.paulsmiths.edu/slh/residence_life/housing.php?type=current |archive-date=2012-02-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Smith's rural location lends itself to many campus-based activities. Student-directed clubs administrated under the Office of Student Activities include fishing and hunting, Artisans' club, Outing club, Students for Environmental Action, Society of American Foresters, the Wildlife Society, Student Government Association, InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, Ski and Snowboard Club, Gaming club, Fish and Game Club, and Mycology club, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulsmiths.edu/slh/student_activities/clubs&amp;orgs.php?type=current |title=Clubs &amp; Organizations |publisher=Paulsmiths.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219195341/http://www.paulsmiths.edu/slh/student_activities/clubs%26orgs.php?type=current |archive-date=2012-02-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus is located on Lower St. Regis Lake. Students have a beach, as well as docks and storage for canoes and kayaks.

The Lakeside Dining Hall is operated by [[Sodexo|Sodexo food service]].  A.P. Smith's bakery in Cantwell Hall opens a few days a semester to sell student-produced baked goods.

== Sports ==
The college raises a variety of sports teams from the school's general population, including basketball, soccer, rugby, bowling, and cross-country. Most are under the direction of administrative staff and faculty.

The college also offers sports programs reflecting its outdoor character, such as snowshoe racing, coed woodsmen's teams, and canoe racing.&lt;ref name="paulsmiths1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/timber/home.php |title=Woodsmen's Team |publisher=Paulsmiths.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103203028/http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/timber/home.php |archive-date=2012-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the warmer months students may rent canoes to use on Lower Saint Regis Lake, located on the southern side of campus.

The newly renovated Saunders Sports Complex houses the Bobcat fitness center, a gymnasium, dance studio, and campus pool.  It is home to the school's [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] and dive training programs, the kayaking club's whitewater training, and log birling practice, an event in [[woodsman]] [[lumberjack sports]] competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/recreation.php |title=Recreational Programs |publisher=Paulsmiths.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103203033/http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/recreation.php |archive-date=2012-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility is open to the general public for a nominal fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/facilities.php |title=Facilities Operation |publisher=Paulsmiths.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103203019/http://www.paulsmiths.edu/athletics/facilities.php |archive-date=2012-11-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A {{convert|32|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall climbing wall was opened in the adjacent Buxton Annex gymnasium in 2010.

Timbersports take place in both Fall and Spring semesters, with teams practicing every month of the school year.  Events include pole climbing,  log birling, chopping, splitting, sawing, pulp toss, ax-throw, and pack-board relay.

The Paul Smith's woodsmen's team's nine-year winning streak (from 1957-1966) in the sport's biggest event, the Spring Meet, is the longest in the history of intercollegiate lumberjack competition.&lt;ref name="paulsmiths1"/&gt; The school's highly regarded squad travels to meets throughout the Northeast and Ontario, Canada.

Both the men and women's soccer teams at Paul Smith's compete in an annual rivalry game with the teams from SUNY-ESF ([[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry]]), known as the Barkeater Cup. The PSC men's soccer team won the Cup in 2014. Men's and woem's team participate in the Yankee Small College Conference regionally, and the USCAA on a national level.

'''Photo-Induced Cross-Linking of Unmodified Proteins (PICUP)''' is a protein cross-linking method by visible light irradiation of a photocatalyst in the presence of an electron acceptor and the protein of interest.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahimi|first=Farid|last2=Maiti|first2=Panchanan|last3=Bitan|first3=Gal|date=2009-01-12|title=Photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) applied to amyloidogenic peptides|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments: JoVE|issue=23|doi=10.3791/1071|issn=1940-087X|pmc=2763294|pmid=19229175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irradiation results in a highly reactive protein radical that forms a covalent bond between the amino acid side chains of the proteins to be linked. [[Cross-link|Cross-linking methods]] developed prior to PICUP, including the use of physical, oxidative, and chemical cross-linkers, often require more time and result in protein byproducts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the cross-linked protein yield is very low due to the multifunctionality of the cross-linking reagents.

The process was first applied in 1999 to utilize protein cross-linking techniques to analyze the interactions between polypeptides as well as structural differences proteins undergo in a [[Catalysis|catalytic pathway]]. The techniques in the 20th century were not sufficient to be applied to cross-link fast and transient changes of these proteins in high yield. PICUP allowed for rapid (&lt;1 second) and high production of covalently-linked proteins in close proximity with each other.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fancy|first=David A.|last2=Kodadek|first2=Thomas|date=1999-05-25|title=Chemistry for the analysis of protein–protein interactions: Rapid and efficient cross-linking triggered by long wavelength light|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=96|issue=11|pages=6020–6024|issn=0027-8424|pmc=26828|pmid=10339534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Fancy and Kodadek ===

Fancy and Kodadek's application of PICUP in 1999 was the first time proteins cross-linking was able to be performed in such a short period of time (1 second) and without modifying the structure of the proteins in question.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, PICUP was able to be performed at physiological pH of 7.4, which opened doors for further application of protein cross-linking such as studying the biochemical mechanisms that proteins participate in the human body. In addition, irradiation by [[Light|visible light]] in PICUP is useful because many biomolecules that participate in metabolic pathways to be analyzed do no absorb light with wavelengths below the range for [[Ultraviolet|UV light]], allowing for cross-links without denaturation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Bitan, Lomakin, and Teplow ===

In 2001, Gal Bitan, Aleksey Lomakin, and David B. Teplow applied PICUP to study [[Amyloid beta|amyloid β-protein (Aβ)]] oligomerization, which is observed in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bitan|first=Gal|last2=Lomakin|first2=Aleksey|last3=Teplow|first3=David B.|date=2001-09-14|title=Amyloid β-Protein Oligomerization PRENUCLEATION INTERACTIONS REVEALED BY PHOTO-INDUCED CROSS-LINKING OF UNMODIFIED PROTEINS|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/276/37/35176|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|language=en|volume=276|issue=37|pages=35176–35184|doi=10.1074/jbc.M102223200|issn=0021-9258|pmid=11441003}}&lt;/ref&gt; PICUP allowed for identifying and quantifying the Aβ oligomers that are metastable because of its ability to rapidly cross-link.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Coupling PICUP with [[Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis|sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)]], the distribution of oligomers in rapid equilibrium was quantified.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This application allowed for the study of amyloidogenic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases and opened doors for possible future therapeutic mechanisms. [[Neurodegeneration|Neurodegenerative diseases]] are currently suggested to be the result of neurotoxic proteins, so the ability to study their oligomer distribution is effective in understanding how and under what conditions these oligomers are formed.

The mechanism of PICUP require the [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridyl)Ru(II) complex]], an electron acceptor, [[Ammonium persulfate|ammonium persulfate (APS)]], and reactive amino acid side chains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tris(2,2′‐bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate, a tris(bipyridyl)Ru(II) complex, initially contains a Ru&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bitan|first=Gal|date=2006|title=Structural study of metastable amyloidogenic protein oligomers by photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins|journal=Methods in Enzymology|volume=413|pages=217–236|doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(06)13012-8|issn=0076-6879|pmc=2782599|pmid=17046399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon visible light irradiation and in the presence of ammonium persulfate (APS), Ru&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; enters its excited state and is oxidized to Ru&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ru&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is now an extremely reactive oxidizer that only wants to accept one electron instead of the standard two.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reaction can proceed in the absence of an electron acceptor, but it will have a much lower efficiency, producing byproducts resulting from the excited Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reacting with oxygen.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fancy|first=D.

[[File:Forming dimers.png|left|thumb|500x500px|Formation of covalent bond between amino acid side chains (Tyrosine)]]The unpaired single electron on the side chain reacts with another amino acid side chain of a polypeptide in the vicinity, resulting in a dimer with a covalent bond.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the regeneration of Ru&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; when Ru&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; picks up an electron from the amino acids allows for continuous formation of radicals with Ru&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; being oxidized by APS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the PCR tube that the reaction takes place in, numerous unstable protein radicals come in contact with each other through simple diffusion and react both intra- and intermolecularly to achieve a more stable state. The monomeric protein radicals are able to achieve a lower energy state through forming a covalent bond to produce a dimer and releasing a hydrogen atom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This newly formed dimer is also able to react with numerous other monomers or dimers through the same mechanism, creating higher numbers of cross-linked oligomers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This allows for a distribution of variety of oligomers to be present in the mixture.

== Method ==
[[File:PICUP Apparatus .jpg|thumb|Camera apparatus used to irradiate the protein mixture]]In every experiment, it is important to determine the relative concentration of the protein in question, ammonium persulfate, and Tris(2,2′‐bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate that will be used in the protein cross-linking experiment. Previous experiments have shown that for [[Amyloid beta|amyloid β-protein (Aβ)]], the peptide assumed to cause toxicity in [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's Disease]], the ratio of protein: Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: APS is 1:2:40.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ratio of Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and APS is suggested to be kept at this ratio, but the appropriate concentration of a given protein can vary. For many proteins that PICUP has not yet been used for, finding the appropriate concentrations can be done through trial and error. Generally, protein concentrations would fall in between 10 and 50µM, dissolved in the corresponding buffer, most likely [[Sodium phosphates|sodium phosphate]] if testing for conditions at physiological pH. However, some studies of pure protein suggest that the protein to Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ratio should be kept at 1:2 as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This level arises from the fact that the lower amount of Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can lead to the protein sample appearing to have more than the actual number of higher order oligomers, and a greater amount of Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can allow for artificial cross-linking byproducts.

The general method for PICUP is as follows:
# The appropriate amount of the protein is pipetted into the polymerase chain reaction tube (PCR).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1385/1-59259-874-9:011|title=Determination of Peptide Oligomerization State Using Rapid Photochemical Crosslinking|last=Vollers|first=Sabrina S.|last2=Teplow|first2=David B.|last3=Bitan|first3=Gal|pages=011–018|language=en|doi=10.1385/1-59259-874-9:011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Ammonium persulfate (APS) and Tris(2,2′‐bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate are added to the sample and mixed briefly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
# The PCR tube is placed in a glass vial to hold it still inside the bellows of the camera that would irradiate the mixture. Upon closing the lid that covers the camera, pressing down the camera shutter illuminates the tube for however long you program the camera to irradiate for. Using the same camera for every replicate of the experiment ensures that the irradiation time and the distance from the light sourced is controlled for every PICUP experiment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# After the sample in the PCR tube is irradiated, a calculated amount of 1M [[Dithiothreitol|Dithiothreitol (DTT)]] is immediately added to the mixture to quench the reaction. If the reaction is not quenched, the oligomers will continually aggregate and lower order oligomers will not be present in the mixture. In addition, if [[Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis|SDS-PAGE]] is to be used to analyze the oligomer distribution of the proteins after PICUP, DTT would also act as a denaturing agent to the proteins before gel electrophoresis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications  ==
Using PICUP on protein complexes is useful in providing catalytic and kinetic information about these proteins, as catalytic mechanisms are rapid and PICUP allows for fast and highly efficient cross-linking of proteins.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some [[epitope]] and [[affinity tags]] were shown to be unaffected by the PICUP reaction, enabling visualization of the cross-linked proteins.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Furthermore, PICUP allows for visualization of quantitative bands of protein oligomer distribution when it is coupled with protein fractionation techniques. This combination is especially useful when examining the oligomers of neurodegenerative diseases, such as [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s disease]], [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s disease]], and [[Huntington’s disease]], that result from protein aggregation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; PICUP is extremely important when possible prevention and treatment procedures for these diseases are explored, as it is necessary to investigate the aggregation propensity of the respective [[Amyloid|amyloidogenic proteins]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11003">{{short description|The fraction of plankton composed by cells between 0.2 and 2 μm that can be prokaryotic or eukaryotic and phototrophs or heterotrophs}}
[[File:Picoplancton fluorescence Pacific.jpg|thumb|Photosynthetic picoplankton from the Pacific Ocean (off the [[Marquesas Islands]] observed by [[epifluorescence]] microscopy (blue exciting light). Orange fluorescing dots correspond to ''[[Synechocococus]]'' [[cyanobacteria]], red fluorescing dots to [[picoeukaryote]]s. Larger cells (e.g. [[diatom]], upper right) can also be seen.]]
'''Picoplankton''' is the fraction of [[plankton]] composed by [[cell (biology)|cells]] between 0.2 and 2 μm that can be either prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs and heterotrophs:
* [[photosynthetic]] {{Main|Photosynthetic picoplankton}}
* [[heterotrophic]] {{Main|Heterotrophic picoplankton}}
They are prevalent amongst microbial plankton communities of both freshwater and marine ecosystems. They have an important role in making up a significant portion of the total biomass of phytoplankton communities

== Classification == 
In general, plankton can be categorized on the basis of physiological, taxonomic, or dimensional characteristics. Subsequently, a generic classification of a plankton includes:
* [[Bacterioplankton]]
* [[Phytoplankton]]
* [[Zooplankton]]
However, there is a simpler scheme that categorizes plankton based on a logarithmic size scale: 
* Macroplankton (200-2000 μm)
* Micro-plankton (20-200 μm)
* Nanoplankton (2-20 μm)
This was even further expanded to include picoplankton (0.2-2 μm) and fem-toplankton (0.02-0.2 μm), as well as net plankton, ultraplankton. Now that picoplankton have been characterized, they have their own further subdivisions such as prokaryotic and eukaryotic phototrophs and heterotrophs that are spread throughout the world in various types of lakes and tropic states. 
In order to differentiate between autotrophic picoplankton and heterotrophic picoplankton, the autotrophs could have photosynthetic pigments and the ability to show autofluorescence, which would allow for their enumeration under epifluorescence microscopy. This is how minute eukaryotes first became known.&lt;ref&gt;C. Callieri and J. G. Stockner, Freshwater autotrophic picoplankton: a review, J. Limnol., 2002, 61, 1–14 [http://www.jlimnol.it/index.php/jlimnol/article/viewFile/jlimnol.2002.1/360]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Overall, picoplankton play an essential role in oligotrophic dimicitc lakes because they are able to produce and then accordingly recycle dissolved organic matter (DOM) in a very efficient manner under circumstance when competition of other phytoplankters is disturbed by factors such as limiting nutrients and predators.
Picoplankton are responsible for the most primary productivity in oligotrophic gyres, and are distinguished from [[nanoplankton]] and [[microplankton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blacksea-education.ru/phytoplankton.shtml|title=Phytoplankton in the Black Sea|first=Alexander|last=Vershinin|publisher=Russian Federal Children Center Orlyonok}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because they are small, they have a greater surface to volume ratio, enabling them to obtain the scarce nutrients in these ecosystems.
Furthermore, some species can also be [[mixotrophic]]. The smallest of cells (200&amp;nbsp;nm) are on the order of nanometers, not picometers. The [[SI]] prefix [[pico-]] is used quite loosely here, as nanoplankton and microplankton are only 10 and 100 times larger, respectively, although it is somewhat more accurate when considering the volume rather than the length.

== Role in ecosystems ==
Picoplankton contribute greatly to the [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] and [[primary production]] in both [[Marine ecosystem|marine]] and [[Lake ecosystem|freshwater lake]] ecosystems. In the ocean, the concentration of picoplankton is 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cells per millilitre of ocean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=T.

This is due to their use of [[photopigment]]s and efficiency at using blue-green light at these depths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Picoplankton population densities do not fluctuate throughout the year except in a few cases of smaller lakes where their biomass increases as the temperature of the lake water increases.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Picoplankton also play an important role in the [[microbial loop]] of these systems by aiding in providing energy to higher [[trophic level]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are grazed by a various number of organisms such as [[flagellate]]s, [[ciliate]]s, [[rotifer]]s and [[copepod]]s. Flagellates are their main predator due to their ability to swim towards picoplankton in order to consume them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Oceanic picoplankton ==
Picoplankton are important in nutrient cycling in all major oceans, where they exist in their highest [[Abundance (ecology)|abundances]]. They have many features that allow them to survive in these oligotrophic (low-nutrient) and low-light regions, such as the use several nitrogen sources, including nitrate, ammonium, and urea.&lt;ref name="Stockner"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stockner|first1=John G|title=Phototrophic picoplankton: An overview from marine and freshwater ecosystems|journal=The American Society of Limnology and Oceanography|date=1988|volume=4|issue=33|pages=765–775|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their small size and large surface area allows for efficient nutrient acquisition, incident light absorption, and organism growth.&lt;ref name="Agawin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agawin|first1=Nona S|last2=Duarte|first2=Carlos M|last3=Augusti|first3=Susana|title=Nutrient and temperature control of the contribution of picoplankton to phytoplankton biomass and production|journal=The American Society of Limnology and Oceanography|date=2000|volume=3|issue=45|pages=591–600|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A small size also allows for minimal metabolic maintenance.&lt;ref name="Callieri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Callieri|first1=Cristiana|last2=Stockner|first2=John G|title=Freshwater autotrophic picoplankton: a review|journal=Journal of Limnology|date=2002|volume=1|issue=61|pages=1–14|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picoplankton, specifically phototrophic picoplankton, play a significant role in the carbon production of open oceanic environments, which largely contributes to the [[Carbon cycle|global carbon production]].&lt;ref name="Stockner"/&gt; Their carbon production contributes to at least 10% of global aquatic net primary productivity.&lt;ref name="Agawin"/&gt; High primary productivity contributions are made in both oligotrophic and deep zones in oceans.&lt;ref name="Stockner"/&gt; Picoplankton are dominant in biomass in open ocean regions.&lt;ref name="Moon"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon-van der Staay|first1=Seung Yeo|last2=De Wachter|first2=Rupert|last3=Vaulot|first3=Daniel|title=Oceanic 18S rDNA sequences from picoplankton reveal unsuspected eukaryotic diversity|journal=Nature|date=February 2001|issue=409|pages=607–610|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Picoplankton also form the base of aquatic microbial food webs and are an energy source in the [[microbial loop]].  All trophic levels in a marine food web are affected by picoplankton carbon production and the gain or loss of picoplankton in the environment, especially in oligotrophic conditions.&lt;ref name="Callieri"/&gt;  Marine predators of picoplankton include heterotrophic [[flagellates]] and [[ciliates]].&lt;ref name="Stockner"/&gt; [[Protozoa]] are a dominant predator of picoplankton.&lt;ref name="Callieri"/&gt; Picoplankton are often lost through processes such as grazing, parasitism, and viral [[lysis]].&lt;ref name="Callieri"/&gt;

== Measurement ==
Marine scientists have slowly begun to understand in the last 10 or 15 years the importance of even the smallest subdivisions of plankton and their role in aquatic food webs and in organic and inorganic nutrient recycling. Therefore, being able to accurately measure the biomass and size distribution of picoplankton communities has now become rather essential. Two of the prevalent methods used to identify and enumerate picoplankton are [[fluorescence microscopy]] and [[visual counting]]. However, both methods are outdated because of their time-consuming and inaccurate nature. As a result, newer, faster, and more accurate methods have emerged lately, including [[flow cytometry]] and [[image-analyzed fluorescence microscopy]]. Both techniques are efficient in measuring nano plankton and auto-fluorescing phototrophic picoplankton. However, measuring very minute size ranges of picoplankton has often proven to be difficult to measure, which is why Charge-coupled devices (CCD) and video cameras are now being used to measure small picoplankton, although a slow-scan CCD-based camera is more effective at detecting and sizing tiny particles such as bacteria that is fluorochrome-stained.

'''''Pornified: How Pornography Is Damaging Our Lives, Our Relationships, and Our Families''''' is a 2005 book by American writer [[Pamela Paul]], discussing the impact of ready access to [[pornography]] on Americans.

The book was selected as one of the best books of 2005 by ''The San Francisco Chronicle'' and was a ''New York Times Book Review'' Editor's Choice. Social conservatives such as [[Albert Mohler]], President of the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]], endorsed the book enthusiastically,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crosswalk.com/1346936/ Pornified America--The Culture of Pornography]&lt;/ref&gt; though he predicted it might "find a chilly reception in a society increasingly given over to the [[sexual arousal|titillation]], perversion, and profits offered by pornography".

The ''Washington Post Book World'' characterized the book as "A persuasive argument that today's pornography is not the [[Playboy]] centerfold or the Deep Throat of yesteryear...Paul's remedy charts a sensible middle ground between restraints and free speech." Sex columnist [[Amy Sohn]], on the other hand, cared less for the book and argued in the ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' that "Paul never gives credence to the many women who enjoy consuming porn, alone or with partners".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/11/books/review/11sohn.html "Pornified - Dirty Minds," Amy Sohn, ''New York Times Book Review,'' September 11, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Post-theism''' is a variant of [[nontheism]] that proposes that the division of [[theism]] vs.  [[atheism]] is obsolete, that [[God]] belongs to a stage of human development now past. Within nontheism, post-theism can be contrasted with [[antitheism]].
The term appears in Christian [[Liberal Christianity|liberal theology]] and [[Postchristianity]].

[[Frank Hugh Foster]] in a 1918 lecture announced that modern culture had arrived at a "post-theistic stage" in which humanity has taken possession of the powers of agency and creativity that had formerly been projected upon God.&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Dorrien , ''The Making of American Liberal Theology: Idealism, Realism, and Modernity, 1900-1950'' (2003), {{ISBN|978-0-664-22355-7}}, p. 177f.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Denys Turner]] argues that [[Karl Marx]] did not choose atheism over theism, but rejected the binary "[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Feuerbach]]ian" choice altogether, a position which by being post-theistic is at the same time necessarily '''post-atheistic'''.&lt;ref&gt;D. Turner, "Religion: Illusions and liberation", in: Terrell Carver (ed), ''The Cambridge Companion to Marx'' (1991), {{ISBN|978-0-521-36694-6}}, p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, at one point Marx argued "there should be less trifling with the label 'atheism,'” as he insisted "religion in itself is without content, it owes its being not to heaven but to the earth, and with the abolition of distorted reality, of which it is the theory, it will collapse of itself."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/letters/42_11_30.htm Karl Marx, ''Letter from Marx to Arnold Ruge In Dresden'' (1842)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Related ideas include [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s pronouncement that "[[God is dead]]" and the [[transtheism]] of [[Paul Tillich]] or [[Pema Chödrön]].

'''Raphael Judah (R.J.) Zwi Werblowsky''' ({{lang-he|רפאל יהודה צבי ורבלובסקי}}; 1924, Frankfurt — July 9, 2015, Jerusalem) was an Israeli scholar of religion specializing in [[comparative religion]] and [[interfaith dialogue]]. Werblowsky served as Dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] between 1965—1969, Secretary-General and later Vice-President of the International Association for the History of Religions, Vice-President of the International Council for Philosophy and the Humanities of UNESCO and the chief editor of the journal [[Numen (journal)|''Numen'']]. He also co-edited The Encyclopedia of the Jewish Religion. In 2005 R.J. Zvi Werblowsky became a recipient of [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture]], and in 2009 he was awarded [[Order of the Rising Sun|Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon]] by the government of Japan.

== Biography ==

Toward the end of the 1930s he immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]] and studied at several [[Yeshiva]]s there (including world-famous [[Ponevezh Yeshiva]]&lt;ref name="Stroumsa"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15685276-12341404 |first=Guy G. |last=Stroumsa |authorlink=Guy Stroumsa |title=R.

|doi=10.1163/15685276-12341404 |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He proceeded with his studies at the [[University of London]] and completed his bachelor's degree there in 1945. Following the end of World War II Werblowsky worked at an orphanage in the Netherlands which prepared Jewish children who survived the Holocaust for immigration to Palestine and later [[State of Israel]]. In 1951, he received his PhD from the [[University of Geneva]].&lt;ref name="Sarna"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/28655/discussions/74702/obituary-prof-rj-zwi-werblowsky |title=Obituary: Prof. R.J.

After receiving his doctoral degree Werblowsky for five years was teaching in England (Manchester and Leeds&lt;ref name="Stroumsa" /&gt;) before returning to Israel in 1956. There he was among the founders of the Department of Comparative Religion at the [[Hebrew University in Jerusalem]]. He stayed with this institution till his retirement in 1980. Between 1965—1969 Werblowsky served as the Dean of the Faculty of Humanities at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He was also teaching as a Visiting Professor in many universities around the world.&lt;ref name="Sarna" /&gt;

In 1958 R.J. Zwi Werblowsky founded the Israel Inter-Faith Committee in Jerusalem and later founded the Jerusalem Rainbow Club which served as the place for contacts and discussions between Jewish, Muslim and Christian intellectuals. Between 1975—1985 Werblowski served as Secretary-General of the International Association for the History of Religions (IAHR), where he later assumed the position of Vice-President. Between 1984—1988 he was serving as Vice-President of the International Council for Philosophy and the Humanities of [[UNESCO]]. Werblowsky was also for many years editing [[Numen (journal)|''Numen'']], one of the leading journals in the field of [[comparative religion]]&lt;ref name="Stroumsa" /&gt; and was a coeditor of The Encyclopedia of the Jewish Religion.&lt;ref name="Sarna" /&gt;

In 2005 Zvi Werblowsky was awarded [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture]] for his contribution to the study of the religion in various cultures in Israel and for his role in promoting [[interfaith dialogue]] and the encouragement of religious tolerance in Israel and abroad.&lt;ref name="Sarna" /&gt; In 2009 he was awarded [[Order of the Rising Sun|Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon]] for his contributions to the development of Japan studies in Israel and promotion of academic contacts between Japan and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2009/05/07/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/japan-to-honor-israeli-professor |title=Japan to honor Israeli professor |author=Marcy Oster. |publisher=Jewish Telegraph Agency |date=May 7, 2009 |accessdate=May 17, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304013927/http://www.jta.org/2009/05/07/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/japan-to-honor-israeli-professor |archivedate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in July 2015.

The [[undergrowth]] in some areas of a rainforest can be restricted by poor penetration of [[sunlight]] to ground level. If the [[leaf]] [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] is destroyed or thinned, the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense, tangled growth of [[vine]]s, [[shrub]]s and small [[tree]]s, called a [[jungle]]. The term ''jungle'' is also sometimes applied to tropical rainforests generally.

Rainforests as well as endemic rainforest species are rapidly disappearing due to [[#Deforestation|deforestation]], the resulting [[habitat loss]] and [[air pollution|pollution of the atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0908.htm |title=Impact of Deforestation – Extinction |publisher=Rainforests.mongabay.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Temperate rainforest map.svg|thumb|left|General distribution of [[temperate rainforest]]s]]

Tropical forests cover a large part of the globe, but '''temperate rainforests''' only occur in few regions around the world. Temperate rainforests are rainforests in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions. They occur in [[North America]] (in the [[Pacific Northwest]] in [[Alaska]], [[British Columbia]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]]), in [[Europe]] (parts of the [[British Isles]] such as the coastal areas of [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], [[southern Norway]], parts of the western [[Balkans]] along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, as well as in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and coastal areas of the eastern [[Black Sea]], including [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and coastal [[Turkey]]), in [[East Asia]] (in [[Northern and southern China|southern China]], Highlands of [[Taiwan]], much of [[Japan]] and [[Korea]], and on [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]] and the adjacent [[Temperate rainforests of the Russian Far East|Russian Far East]] coast), in [[South America]] (southern [[Chile]]) and also in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.marietta.edu/~biol/biomes/temprain.htm|title= The Temperate Rainforest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layers==
{{main|Stratification (vegetation)}}
A tropical rainforest typically has a number of layers, each with different plants and animals adapted for life in that particular area. Examples include the emergent, [[canopy (biology)|canopy]], [[understory]] and [[forest floor]] layers.

===Emergent layer===
The '''emergent layer''' contains a small number of very large [[tree]]s called '''emergents''', which grow above the general [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]], reaching heights of 45–55 m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 70–80 m tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Bourgeron |first= Patrick S.|editor= Frank B. Golley |title=Tropical Rain Forest Ecosystems. Structure and Function |year= 1983 |edition= 14A|series= Ecosystems of the World |publisher= Elsevier Scientific |isbn= 0-444-41986-1 |pages= 29–47 |chapter= Spatial Aspects of Vegetation Structure}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nativetreesociety.org/worldtrees/sea_ei/malaysia/sabah2005.htm | title = Sabah | publisher = [[Eastern Native Tree Society]] | accessdate= 2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They need to be able to withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. [[Eagle]]s, [[Butterfly|butterflies]], [[bat]]s and certain [[monkey]]s inhabit this layer.
[[File:FRIM canopy.JPG|thumb|The canopy at the [[Forest Research Institute Malaysia]] showing [[crown shyness]]]]

===Canopy layer===
{{Main|Canopy (biology)}}
The '''canopy''' layer contains the majority of the largest trees, typically {{convert|30|m}} to {{convert|45|m}} tall. The densest areas of [[biodiversity]] are found in the forest canopy, a more or less continuous cover of foliage formed by adjacent treetops. The canopy, by some estimates, is home to 50 percent of all plant species. [[Epiphyte|Epiphytic plants]] attach to [[Trunk (botany)|trunks]] and [[branch]]es, and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer, but more diverse. A quarter of all insect species are believed to exist in the rainforest canopy. Scientists have long suspected the richness of the canopy as a habitat, but have only recently developed practical methods of exploring it. As long ago as 1917, [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[William Beebe]] declared that "another continent of life remains to be discovered, not upon the Earth, but one to two hundred feet above it, extending over thousands of square miles." True exploration of this habitat only began in the 1980s, when scientists developed methods to reach the canopy, such as firing ropes into the trees using [[crossbow]]s. [[Canopy research|Exploration of the canopy]] is still in its infancy, but other methods include the use of [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloons]] and [[airship]]s to float above the highest branches and the building of cranes and walkways planted on the forest floor. The science of accessing tropical forest canopy using airships or similar aerial platforms is called [[dendronautics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dendronautics.org/ Dendronautics – Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614070953/http://www.dendronautics.org/ |date=June 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understory layer===
{{Main|Understory}}
The '''understory''' or '''understorey''' layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor. It is home to a number of [[bird]]s, [[snake]]s and [[lizard]]s, as well as [[predation|predators]] such as [[jaguar]]s, [[boa (genus)|boa constrictors]] and [[leopard]]s. The leaves are much larger at this level and insect life is abundant. Many [[seedling]]s that will grow to the canopy level are present in the understory. Only about 5% of the sunlight shining on the rainforest canopy reaches the understory. This layer can be called a ''[[shrub layer]]'', although the shrub layer may also be considered a separate layer.

===Forest floor===
{{main article|Forest floor}}

[[File:Forest in the bluemountains.jpg|thumb|Rainforest in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], [[Australia]]]]
The '''forest floor''', the bottom-most layer, receives only 2% of the sunlight. Only plants [[Adaptation|adapted]] to low light can grow in this region. Away from [[river]]banks, [[swamp]]s and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation because of the low sunlight penetration. It also contains [[decomposition|decaying]] plant and animal matter, which disappears quickly, because the warm, humid conditions promote rapid decay. Many forms of [[Fungus|fungi]] growing here help decay the animal and plant waste.

==Flora and fauna==
[[File:Chameleon - Tanzania - Usambara Mountains.jpg|thumb|right|upright|West Usambara Two-Horned Chameleon (''[[Bradypodion fischeri]]'') in the [[Usambara Mountains]], [[Tanzania]].]]
More than half of the world's species of plants and animals are found in the rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rain-tree.com/facts.htm |title=Rainforest Facts |publisher=Rain-tree.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainforests support a very broad array of [[fauna]], including [[mammal]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s and [[invertebrate]]s.  Mammals may include [[primate]]s, [[felidae|felids]] and other families.  Reptiles include [[snake]]s, [[turtle]]s, [[chameleon]]s and other families; while birds include such families as [[vanga|vangidae]] and [[cuckoo|Cuculidae]]. Dozens of families of invertebrates are found in rainforests. [[Fungus|Fungi]] are also very common in rainforest areas as they can feed on the decomposing remains of plants and animals. 

==Soils==
{{Expand section|date=December 2008}}
Despite the growth of [[vegetation]] in a tropical rainforest, [[soil quality]] is often quite poor. Rapid [[bacteria]]l decay prevents the accumulation of [[humus]]. The concentration of [[iron]] and [[aluminium]] [[oxide]]s by the [[Laterite|laterization]] process gives the [[oxisol]]s a bright red colour and sometimes produces [[mineral]] [[deposition (geology)|deposits]] such as [[bauxite]]. Most trees have roots near the surface, because there are insufficient nutrients below the surface; most of the trees' minerals come from the top layer of decomposing leaves and animals. On younger substrates, especially of [[Volcano|volcanic]] origin, tropical soils may be quite fertile. If rainforest trees are cleared, rain can accumulate on the exposed soil surfaces, creating run-off and beginning a process of soil [[erosion]]. Eventually streams and rivers form and flooding becomes possible.

==Effect on global climate==
A natural rainforest emits and absorbs vast quantities of [[carbon dioxide]]. On a global scale, long-term fluxes are approximately in balance, so that an undisturbed rainforest would have a small net impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/CLIMATE/IPCC_TAR/wg1/pdf/TAR-03.PDF |title=Grida.no |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they may have other climatic effects (on [[cloud]] formation, for example, by recycling [[water vapour]]). No rainforest today can be considered to be undisturbed.&lt;ref name = Lewis&gt;Lewis, S.L., Phillips, O.L., Baker, T.R., Lloyd, J. et al. 2004 “Concerted changes in tropical forest structure and dynamics: evidence from 50 South American long-term plots”  Phil.

{{further|Tropical rainforest#Human dimensions}}
Tropical rainforests provide [[timber]] as well as animal products such as meat and hides. Rainforests also have value as [[tourism]] destinations and for the [[ecosystem services]] provided. Many foods originally came from tropical forests, and are still mostly grown on [[plantation]]s in regions that were formerly primary forest.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N. (1985). ''The primary source''. [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], New York, pp. 189–193.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, plant-derived medicines are commonly used for fever, fungal infections, burns, gastrointestinal problems, pain, respiratory problems, and wound treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/fieldcourses03/PapersCostaRicaArticles/FinalPaper.TheMedicinalVa.html |title=Final Paper: The Medicinal Value of the Rainforest May 15, 2003. Amanda Haidet May 2003 |publisher=Jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, rainforests are usually not used [[sustainably]] by non-native peoples but are being [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploited]] or removed for [[agricultural expansion|agricultural purposes]].

===Native peoples===

On January 18, 2007, [[Fundação Nacional do Índio|FUNAI]] reported also that it had confirmed the presence of 67 different [[uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribes]] in Brazil, up from 40 in 2005.

Central African rainforest is home of the [[Mbuti]] [[pygmies]], one of the hunter-gatherer peoples living in equatorial rainforests characterised by their short height (below one and a half metres, or 59&amp;nbsp;inches, on average). They were the subject of a study by [[Colin Turnbull]], ''The Forest People'', in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/26252/explore/15.htm The Tribal Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020212056/http://library.thinkquest.org/26252/explore/15.htm |date=2012-10-20 }}, [[ThinkQuest]]&lt;/ref&gt; Pygmies who live in Southeast Asia are, amongst others, referred to as “[[Negrito]]”.

Another factor causing the loss of rainforest is expanding [[urban area]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="163009">Various aspects of the '''relationship between religion and science''' have been cited by modern historians of science and religion, philosophers, theologians, scientists, and others from various geographical regions and cultures. Even though the ancient and medieval worlds did not have conceptions resembling the modern understandings of "science" and "religion", certain elements of these modern ideas are found throughout history. It was in the 19th century when the phrases "religion and science" or "science and religion" first emerged in literature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt; This coincided with the refining of "science", from the studies of "[[natural philosophy]]", and "[[religion]]" as distinct concepts in the last few centuries partly due to professionalization of the sciences, the Protestant Reformation, colonization, and globalization.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Before Religion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt; Since then, many have characterized the relationship as either conflict, harmony, complexity, or mutual independence.

Both science and religion are complex social and cultural endeavors that vary across cultures and have changed over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stenmark|first1=Mikael|title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model|page=45|date=2004|publisher=W.B.

Science Before the Greeks (On changes in science here)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scientific and technical innovations prior to the [[scientific revolution]] were achieved by societies organized by religious traditions. Elements of the [[scientific method]] were pioneered by ancient pagan, Islamic, and Christian scholars. [[Roger Bacon]], who is often credited with formalizing the scientific method, was a Franciscan friar.&lt;ref name="First Scientist, Clegg"&gt;Clegg, Brian. [https://www.amazon.com/First-Scientist-Life-Roger-Bacon/dp/0786713585/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372950566&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Roger+Bacon "The First Scientist: A Life of Roger Bacon"]. Carroll and Graf Publishers, NY, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism has historically embraced reason and empiricism, holding that science brings legitimate, but incomplete knowledge of the world and universe. Confucian thought has held different views of science over time. Most Buddhists today view science as complementary to their beliefs. While the classification of the material world by the ancient [[Mahābhūta|Indians]] and [[Ancient Greece#Science and technology|Greeks]] into [[Classical elements|air, earth, fire and water]] was more philosophical, medieval [[Science in the medieval Islamic world#Notable scientists|Middle Easterns]] used practical and experimental observation to classify materials.&lt;ref name=Jim&gt;''[[Science and Islam (documentary)|Science and Islam]]'', [[Jim Al-Khalili]]. [[BBC]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Events in Europe such as the [[Galileo affair]], associated with the scientific revolution and the [[Age of Enlightenment]], led scholars such as [[John William Draper]] to postulate a [[conflict thesis]], holding that religion and science have been in conflict methodologically, factually and politically throughout history. This thesis is held by some contemporary scientists such as [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], [[Peter Atkins]], and [[Donald Prothero]]. The conflict thesis has lost favor among most contemporary historians of science.&lt;ref name="Russel, C.A. 2002 7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Russel, C.A.|editor=Ferngren, G.B.|year=2002|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|page=7|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|quote=The conflict thesis, at least in its simple form, is now widely perceived as a wholly inadequate intellectual framework within which to construct a sensible and realistic historiography of Western science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shapin1996&gt;{{cite book| author = Shapin, S.| year = 1996| title = The Scientific Revolution| page = 195| publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]]| isbn =| quote = In the late Victorian period it was common to write about the 'warfare between science and religion' and to presume that the two bodies of culture must always have been in conflict.

H.| year = 1991| title = Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives| page= 42| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| isbn =| quote = In its traditional forms, the conflict thesis has been largely discredited.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scientists, philosophers, and theologians throughout history, such as [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]], [[Kenneth R. Miller]] and [[Francis Collins]], have seen compatibility or independence between religion and science. Biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]], other scientists, and some contemporary theologians hold that religion and science are [[non-overlapping magisteria]], addressing fundamentally separate forms of knowledge and aspects of life.  Some theologians or historians of science, including [[John Lennox]], [[Thomas Berry]], [[Brian Swimme]] and [[Ken Wilber]] propose an interconnection between science and religion, while others such as [[Ian Barbour]] believe there are even parallels.

Public acceptance of [[Fact#Fact in science|scientific facts]] may be influenced by religion; many in the [[United States]] reject evolution by [[natural selection]], especially regarding human beings. Nevertheless, the American [[National Academy of Sciences]] has written that "the evidence for evolution can be fully compatible with religious faith", a view officially endorsed by many religious denominations globally.&lt;ref name=nas&gt;{{cite book|title=Science, Evolution and Creationism|author=Committee on Revising Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine of the National Academies|year=2008|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11876.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the phrase "religion and science" or "science and religion" emerged in the 19th century, not before, due to the reification of both concepts.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title=The Territories of Science and Religion|date=2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-18448-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Jon|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=MIchael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0226317838|pages=254–255, 259, 260|chapter=10.

It was in the 19th century that the terms "Buddhism", "Hinduism", "Taoism", "Confucianism" and "World Religions" first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ananda"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephson|first1=Jason Ananda|title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=1, 11–12|isbn=0-226-41234-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morreall|first1=John|last2=Sonn|first2=Tamara|title=50 Great Myths about Religions|date=2013|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780470673508|pages=12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (''scientia'') and religion (''religio'') were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;

It was in the 19th century that the concept of "science" received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as "biology" and "biologist", "physics" and "physicist" among other technical fields and titles; institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred.&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-08928-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''[[scientist]]'' was first coined by the naturalist-theologian [[William Whewell]] in 1834 and it was applied to those who sought knowledge and understanding of nature.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the origin of the word "scientist" to 1834.&lt;/ref&gt; From the ancient world, starting with Aristotle, to the 19th century, the term "[[natural philosophy]]" was the common term used to describe the practice of studying nature.&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Edward|title=A History of Natural Philosophy: From the Ancient World to the Nineteenth Century|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-68957-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isaac Newton's book [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]] (1687), whose title translates to "Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy", reflects the then-current use of the words "natural philosophy", akin to "systematic study of nature". Even in the 19th century, a treatise by [[Lord Kelvin]] and Peter Guthrie Tait's, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled [[Treatise on Natural Philosophy]] (1867).

It was in the 17th century that the concept of "religion" received its modern shape despite the fact that ancient texts like the Bible, the Quran, and other sacred texts did not have a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written.&lt;ref name="Before Religion"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nongbri|first1=Brent|title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|date=2013|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-15416-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 great" /&gt; In the 19th century, [[Max Müller]] noted that what is called ancient religion today, would have been called "law" in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]].

Race, Nation, or Religion?'' ( Philadelphia: Dropsie College Press, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sanskrit]] word "[[dharma]]", sometimes translated as "religion", also means law or duty. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]]. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between "imperial law" and universal or "Buddha law", but these later became independent sources of power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toshio Kuroda|Kuroda, Toshio]] and Jacqueline I.

=== Middle Ages and Renaissance ===
The development of sciences (especially [[natural philosophy]])  in [[Western Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], has considerable foundation in the works of the Arabs who translated [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] [[Classical antiquity|compositions.]]&lt;ref name="Grant1990"&gt;Grant, E. (1990, December 12). ''Science and Religion in the Middle Ages''. Speech presented at "Science and Religion in the Middle Ages," in Harvard University, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; The works of [[Aristotle]] played a major role in the institutionalization, systematization, and expansion of reason. [[Christianity]] accepted reason within the ambit of faith. In [[Christendom]], reason was considered subordinate to [[revelation]], which contained the ultimate truth and this truth could not be challenged. Even though the medieval Christian had the urge to use their reason, they had little on which to exercise it. In medieval universities, the faculty for natural philosophy and theology were separate, and discussions pertaining to theological issues were often not allowed to be undertaken by the faculty of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God and Reason in the Middle Ages|last=Grant|first=Edward|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-511-03262-5|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}}

Natural philosophy, as taught in the arts faculties of the universities, was seen as an essential area of study in its own right and was considered necessary for almost every area of study. It was an independent field, separated from theology, which enjoyed a good deal of intellectual freedom as long as it was restricted to the natural world. In general, there was religious support for natural science by the late Middle Ages and a recognition that it was an important element of learning.&lt;ref name="Grant1990" /&gt;

The extent to which medieval science led directly to the new philosophy of the scientific revolution remains a subject for debate, but it certainly had a significant influence.&lt;ref name="Hall1994" /&gt;

The Middle Ages laid ground for the developments that took place in science, during the [[Renaissance]] which immediately succeeded it. With significant developments taking place in science, mathematics, medicine and philosophy, the relationship between science and religion became one of curiosity and questioning.&lt;ref name="Hall1994"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Renaissance, 1450-1630|last=Hall|first=Marie Boas|publisher=Dover publications|origyear=1962|year=1994|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2017}} As [[humanism]] became more and more popular, people tried to understand the nature around them better, rather than turn to religious aspirations. Renaissance humanism looked to classical Greek and Roman texts to change contemporary thought, allowing for a new mindset after the Middle Ages. Renaissance readers understood these [[Classics|classical texts]] as focusing on human decisions, actions and creations, rather than blindly following the rules set forth by the Catholic Church as "God's plan." Though many Renaissance humanists remained religious, they believed God gave humans opportunities and it was humanity's duty to do the "best and most moral thing". Renaissance humanism was an "ethical theory and practice that emphasized reason, scientific inquiry and human fulfillment in the natural world," said [[Susan Abernethy|Abernethy]].&lt;ref name="Szalay2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/55230-renaissance.html|title=The Renaissance: The 'Rebirth' of Science &amp; Culture|last=Szalay|first=Jessie|date=June 29, 2016&lt;!-- 11:09am ET--&gt;|website=www.livescience.com|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1630, ancient authority from classical literature and philosophy, as well as their necessity, started eroding, although scientists were still expected to be fluent in [[New Latin|Latin]], the international language of Europe's intellectuals. With the sheer success of science and the steady advance of [[rationalism]], the individual scientist gained prestige.&lt;ref name="Hall1994" /&gt;

Along with the inventions of this period, especially the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]], allowed for the dissemination of the [[Bible]] in languages of the common people (languages other than Latin). This allowed more people to read and learn from the scripture, leading to the [[Evangelism|Evangelical movement]]. The people who spread this message, concentrated more on [[Individualism|individual agency]] rather than the structures of the Church.&lt;ref name="Szalay2016" /&gt;

== Perspectives ==
[[File:Dawkins aaconf.jpg|thumb|According to [[Richard Dawkins]], "Not only is science corrosive to religion; religion is corrosive to science. It teaches people to be satisfied with trivial, supernatural non-explanations and blinds them to the wonderful real explanations that we have within our grasp. It teaches them to accept authority, revelation and faith instead of always insisting on evidence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism?language=en Richard Dawkins on militant atheism] ([http://www.ted.com/talks/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism/transcript?language=en transcript]), [[TED talk]], 2007 (page visited on 21 January 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The kinds of interactions that might arise between science and religion have been categorized by theologian, Anglican priest, and physicist [[John Polkinghorne]]: (1) conflict between the disciplines, (2) independence of the disciplines, (3) dialogue between the disciplines where they overlap and (4) integration of both into one field.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Polkinghorne]] ''Science and Theology'' SPCK/Fortress Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8006-3153-6}} pp. 20–22, following [[Ian Barbour]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This typology is similar to ones used by theologians [[Ian Barbour]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4aUPT8fmrbYC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;vq=typology&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U24Iyg68UM2bEY8idn4TyMV4ViJtw Nature, Human Nature, and God], [[Ian G.

=== Incompatibility ===
According to Guillermo Paz-y-Miño-C and Avelina Espinosa, the historical conflict between evolution and religion is intrinsic to the incompatibility between [[scientific]] [[rationalism]]/[[empiricism]] and the belief in [[supernatural]] causation.&lt;ref name=IH&gt;{{cite web|title= The Incompatibility Hypothesis: Evolution versus Supernatural Causation|url=http://faculty.rwu.edu/aespinosa/aespinosa/Publications_files/Incompatibility_Hypothesis_Evolution_SpCausation_Paz-y-MinoC_Espinosa_2014.pdf|publisher=In Why Does Evolution Matter?

IH explains the cause of the controversy science-versus-religion, its fundamental reason. IH addresses directly the inquiry: what elicits the controversy science versus religion? And it offers an educated answer: their intrinsic and opposing approaches to assess reality, i.e. science by means of testing hypotheses, falsifying and/or testing predictions and replication of experiments; religion, in contrast, via belief in supernatural causality. ''Belief'' disrupts, distorts, delays or stops ''(3Ds + S)'' the comprehension and acceptance of scientific evidence. The authors consider the 3Ds + S to be cognitive effects of illusory thinking.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Everlasting Conflict Evolution-and-science versus Religiosity|url= http://faculty.rwu.edu/aespinosa/aespinosa/Publications_files/Paz-y-Mino-C_Espinosa_Everlasting_Conflict_Evol_Sci_Rel_NOVA_2013.pdf|publisher=In Religion and Ethics, edited by Gloria Simpson and Spencer Payne, New York, NY: NOVA Publishers| author=Paz-y-Miño-C G. &amp; Espinosa  A. |date=2013|pages=73–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Jerry Coyne]], views on evolution and levels of religiosity in some countries, along with the existence of books explaining reconciliation between evolution and religion, indicate that people have trouble in believing both at the same time, thus implying incompatibility.&lt;ref name=edge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/coyne09/coyne09_index.html |title=Does The Empirical Nature Of Science Contradict The Revelatory Nature Of Faith? |author= Jerry Coyne |publisher=Edge |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[physical chemist]] [[Peter Atkins]], "whereas religion scorns the power of human comprehension, science respects it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=library&amp;page=atkins_18_2 |title=Who Really Works Hardest to Banish Ignorance? |accessdate=22 March 2008 |author=Atkins, Peter |publisher=[[Council for Secular Humanism]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Planetary scientist]] [[Carolyn Porco]] describes a hope that "the confrontation between science and formal religion will come to an end when the role played by science in the lives of all people is the same played by religion today."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.edge.org/response-detail/11273&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Donald Prothero]] has stated that religion is the reason "questions about [[evolution]], the age of the earth, cosmology, and human evolution nearly always cause Americans to flunk science literacy tests compared to other nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2013/09/25/losing-our-religion/|website=Skepticblog|first=Donald|last=Prothero|date=25 September 2013|title=Losing our religion|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jon Miller, who studies science literacy across nations, states that Americans in general are slightly more scientifically literate than Europeans and the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scientific Literacy: How Do Americans Stack Up? |website=Michigan State University |publisher=Science Daily |date=February 27, 2007 |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/02/070218134322.htm |quote="A slightly higher proportion of American adults qualify as scientifically literate than European or Japanese adults, but the truth is that no major industrial nation in the world today has a sufficient number of scientifically literate adults."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[cosmologist]] and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Lawrence Krauss]], compatibility or incompatibility is a theological concern, not a scientific concern.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt;  In [[Lisa Randall]]'s view, questions of incompatibility or otherwise are not answerable, since by accepting revelations one is abandoning rules of logic which are needed to identify if there are indeed contradictions between holding certain beliefs.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; [[Daniel Dennett]] holds that incompatibility exists because religion is not problematic to a certain point before it collapses into a number of excuses for keeping certain beliefs, in light of evolutionary implications.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt;

According to [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], the central difference between the nature of science and religion is that the claims of science rely on experimental verification, while the claims of religions rely on faith, and these are irreconcilable approaches to knowing. Because of this both are incompatible as currently practiced and the debate of compatibility or incompatibility will be eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haydenplanetarium.org/tyson/read/1999/10/01/holy-wars |title=Holy Wars|author= Neil deGrasse Tyson |publisher=Haydenplanetarium.org |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson From Natural History Magazine, October 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher and physicist [[Victor J. Stenger]]'s view is that science and religion are incompatible due to conflicts between approaches of knowing and the availability of alternative plausible natural explanations for phenomena that is usually explained in religious contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stenger|first=Victor J. | authorlink=Victor_J._Stenger | title=God and the folly of faith : the incompatibility of science and religion|publisher=Prometheus Books|pages=290–96 |location=Amherst, N.Y.|isbn=1-61614-599-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sean M. Carroll]], since religion makes claims that are not compatible with science, such as supernatural events, therefore both are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean|title=Science and Religion are Not Compatible|url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2009/06/23/science-and-religion-are-not-compatible|website=Sean Carroll Blog|date=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] is openly hostile to fundamentalist religion because it actively debauches the scientific enterprise and education involving science. According to Dawkins, religion "subverts science and saps the intellect".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins]], ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Bantam Press, 2006, pp. 282–86.&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that when science teachers attempt to expound on evolution, there is hostility aimed towards them by parents who are skeptical because they believe it conflicts with their own religious beliefs, and that even in some textbooks have had the word 'evolution' systematically removed.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution]]'', Free Press, 2010, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; He has worked to argue the negative effects that he believes religion has on education of science.

====Criticism====

Others such as [[Francis Collins]], [[George F. R. Ellis]],
[[Kenneth R. Miller]], [[Katharine Hayhoe]], [[George Coyne]] and [[Simon Conway Morris]] argue for compatibility since they do not agree that science is incompatible with religion and vice versa. They argue that science provides many opportunities to look for and find God in nature and to reflect on their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpts of Statements by Scientists Who See No Conflict Between Their Faith and Science|url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/StatementsScience.html|publisher=National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kenneth Miller, he disagrees with Jerry Coyne's assessment and argues that since significant portions of scientists are religious and the proportion of Americans believing in evolution is much higher, it implies that both are indeed compatible.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; Elsewhere, Miller has argued that when scientists make claims on science and theism or atheism, they are not arguing scientifically at all and are stepping beyond the scope of science into discourses of meaning and purpose. What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place. Furthermore, he notes that since evolution made the brain and since the brain can handle both religion and science, there is no natural incompatibility between the concepts at the biological level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Finding Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution|date=1999|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-093049-3|pages=284–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karl Giberson argues that when discussing compatibility, some scientific intellectuals often ignore the viewpoints of intellectual leaders in theology and instead argue against less informed masses, thereby, defining religion by non intellectuals and slanting the debate unjustly. He argues that leaders in science sometimes trump older scientific baggage and that leaders in theology do the same, so once theological intellectuals are taken into account, people who represent extreme positions like Ken Ham and Eugenie Scott will become irrelevant.&lt;ref name=edge /&gt; Cynthia Tolman notes that religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures, but when it comes to Christian theology and ultimate truths, she notes that people often rely on scripture, tradition, reason, and experience to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tolman|first1=Cynthia|title=Methods in Religion|url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html|website=Malboro College|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html|archivedate=2015-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conflict thesis ====
{{Main|Conflict thesis}}
The [[conflict thesis]], which holds that religion and science have been in conflict continuously throughout history, was popularized in the 19th century by [[John William Draper]]'s and [[Andrew Dickson White]]'s accounts. It was in the 19th century that relationship between science and religion became an actual formal topic of discourse, while before this no one had pitted science against religion or vice versa, though occasional complex interactions had been expressed before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galileo Goes To Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|year=2009|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|page=3|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most contemporary historians of science now reject the conflict thesis in its original form and no longer support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferngren, G.B.|editor=Ferngren, G.B.|year=2002|title=Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction|page=x|publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]]|isbn=0-8018-7038-0|quote=... while [John] Brooke's view [of a complexity thesis rather than an historical conflict thesis] has gained widespread acceptance among professional historians of science, the traditional view remains strong elsewhere, not least in the popular mind.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scientists religion" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

(p. 7, followed by a list of the basic reasons why the conflict thesis is wrong).&lt;/ref&gt; Historian of science, Gary Ferngren, has stated "Although popular images of controversy continue to exemplify the supposed hostility of Christianity to new scientific theories, studies have shown that Christianity has often nurtured and encouraged scientific endeavour, while at other times the two have co-existed without either tension or attempts at harmonization. If Galileo and the Scopes trial come to mind as examples of conflict, they were the exceptions rather than the rule."&lt;ref&gt;Gary Ferngren (editor). ''Science &amp; Religion: A Historical Introduction''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-8018-7038-0}}. (Introduction, p. ix)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians today have moved away from a conflict model, which is based mainly on two historical episodes (Galileo and Darwin) for a "complexity" model, because religious figures were on both sides of each dispute and there was no overall aim by any party involved to discredit religion.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Richard H.|title=For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-5566-8|pages=19–22, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An often cited example of conflict, that has been clarified by historical research in the 20th century, was the Galileo affair, whereby interpretations of the Bible were used to attack ideas by [[Copernicus]] on [[heliocentrism]]. By 1616 [[Galileo]] went to Rome to try to persuade Catholic Church authorities not to ban Copernicus' ideas. In the end, a decree of the Congregation of the Index was issued, declaring that the ideas that the Sun stood still and that the Earth moved were "false" and "altogether contrary to Holy Scripture", and suspending Copernicus's ''[[De Revolutionibus]]'' until it could be corrected. Galileo was found "vehemently suspect of heresy", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the center of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves. He was required to "abjure, curse and detest" those opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288–93).&lt;/ref&gt; However, before all this, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in a book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism as physically proven since the scientific consensus at the time was that the evidence for heliocentrism was very weak. The Church had merely sided with the scientific consensus of the time.  Pope Urban VIII asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter was fulfilled by Galileo. Whether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic geocentric view in ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', was often portrayed as an unlearned fool who lacked mathematical training. Although the preface of his book claims that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in Latin, Simplicio in Italian), the name "Simplicio" in Italian also has the connotation of "simpleton".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Li4eh7JIMtIC&amp;pg=PA82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&amp;Wallace-2003|Moss &amp; Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&amp;pg=PA11 p. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio. Most historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.&lt;ref&gt;See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133–34)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says "this of course is untrue" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the physical Copernican advocacy. Galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters, the Pope, and was called to Rome to defend his writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Beyond War and Peace:  A Reappraisal of the Encounter between Christianity and Science|url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/1987/PSCF9-87Lindberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual evidences that finally proved heliocentrism came centuries after Galileo: the stellar aberration of light by James Bradley in the 18th century, the orbital motions of binary stars by William Herschel in the 19th century,  the accurate measurement of the stellar parallax in the 19th century, and Newtonian mechanics in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Biékowska|editor1-first=Barbara|title=Scientific World of Copernicus: On the Occasion of the 500th Anniversary of his Birth 1473–1973.|date=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9401026181|pages=63–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Galileo have Proof of the Earth's Movement?|url=http://muse.tau.ac.il/museum/galileo/did_galileo.html|publisher=Tel-Aviv University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to physicist Christopher Graney, Galileo's own observations did not actually support the Copernican view, but were more consistent with Tycho Brahe's hybrid model where that Earth did not move and everything else circled around it and the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanderson|first1=Katharine|title=Galileo backed Copernicus despite data: Stars viewed through early telescopes suggested that Earth stood still|journal=Nature|date=5 March 2010|doi=10.1038/news.2010.105|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100305/full/news.2010.105.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher [[A. C. Grayling]], still believes there is competition between science and religions and point to the origin of the universe, the nature of human beings and the possibility of miracles{{sfn|Grayling|2014|p=55|ps=:''"In fact religion and science are competitors for the truth about quite a number of things, including the origins of the universe, the nature of human beings, and the belief that the laws of nature can be locally and temporarily suspended- thus allowing for miracle"''}}

=== Independence ===

A modern view, described by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] as "[[non-overlapping magisteria]]" (NOMA), is that science and religion deal with fundamentally separate aspects of human experience and so, when each stays within its own domain, they co-exist peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Jay Gould]]. ''[[Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]''. Ballantine Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; While Gould spoke of independence from the perspective of science, [[W. T. Stace]] viewed independence from the perspective of the [[philosophy of religion]]. Stace felt that science and religion, when each is viewed in its own domain, are both consistent and complete.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. T. Stace]], ''[[Time and Eternity: an Essay in the Philosophy of Religion]]'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, NJ, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USA's [[National Academy of Science]] supports the view that science and religion are independent.&lt;ref name="nas.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nas.edu/evolution/Compatibility.html|title=Evolution Resources: Compatibility of Science and Religion |publisher=[[National Academies of the United States]]|work= [[Science, Evolution, and Creationism]]|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Science and religion are based on different aspects of human experience. In science, explanations must be based on evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science and religion are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.&lt;ref name="nas.edu" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Archbishop [[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], both science and religion represent distinct ways of approaching experience and these differences are sources of debate. He views science as [[Positive science|descriptive]] and religion as [[Normative|prescriptive]]. He stated that if science and mathematics concentrate on what the world ''ought to be'', in the way that religion does, it may lead to improperly ascribing properties to the natural world as happened among the followers of [[Pythagoras]] in the sixth century B.C.&lt;ref name=habgood&gt;''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills &amp; Brown, 1964, pp. 11, 14–16, 48–55, 68–69, 87, 90–91.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, proponents of a [[science of morality|normative moral science]] take issue with the idea that science has ''no'' way of guiding "oughts". Habgood also stated that he believed that the reverse situation, where religion attempts to be descriptive, can also lead to inappropriately assigning properties to the natural world. A notable example is the now defunct belief in the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] (geocentric) planetary model that held sway until changes in scientific and religious thinking were brought about by [[Galileo]] and proponents of his views.&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt;

==== Parallels in method ====
According to [[Ian Barbour]], [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] asserted that science is made up of [[paradigms]] that arise from cultural traditions, which is similar to the secular perspective on religion.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968&gt;{{cite book|last=Barbour|first=Ian G.|authorlink=Ian Barbour|editor=Ian G.

[[Michael Polanyi]] asserted that it is merely a commitment to [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] that protects against [[subjectivity]] and has nothing at all to do with personal detachment as found in many conceptions of the scientific method. Polanyi further asserted that all knowledge is personal and therefore the scientist must be performing a very personal if not necessarily subjective role when doing science.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Polanyi added that the scientist often merely follows intuitions of "intellectual beauty, symmetry, and 'empirical agreement'".&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Polanyi held that science requires moral commitments similar to those found in religion.&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt;

Two physicists, [[Charles A. Coulson]] and [[Harold K. Schilling]], both claimed that "the methods of science and religion have much in common."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Schilling asserted that both fields—science and religion—have "a threefold structure—of experience, theoretical interpretation, and practical application."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Coulson asserted that science, like religion, "advances by creative imagination" and not by "mere collecting of facts," while stating that religion should and does "involve critical reflection on experience not unlike that which goes on in science."&lt;ref name=Barbour1968 /&gt; Religious language and scientific language also show parallels (cf. [[rhetoric of science]]).

Philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] has argued that there is superficial conflict but deep concord between science and religion, and that there is deep conflict between science and [[Metaphysical naturalism|naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stanford.library.usyd.edu.au/entries/religion-science/ Science and Religion], by Alvin Plantinga, 2007, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga, in his book ''Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism'', heavily contests the linkage of naturalism with science, as conceived by Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and like-minded thinkers; while Daniel Dennett thinks that Plantinga stretches science to an unacceptable extent.&lt;ref name=schuessler&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuessler|first=Jennifer|title=Philosopher sticks up for God|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/books/alvin-plantingas-new-book-on-god-and-science.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 December 2011|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Maarten Boudry]], in reviewing the book, has commented that he resorts to [[creationism]] and fails to "stave off the conflict between theism and evolution."&lt;ref name=boudry&gt;{{cite journal|first=Maarten|last=Boudry|authorlink=Maarten Boudry|magazine=International History, Philosophy and Science Teaching Group|date=September 2012|title=Review of Alvin Plantinga (2011), Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion and Naturalism|quote=Plantinga's effort to stave off the conflict between theism and evolution is a failure... if the bar for rational belief is lowered to mere logical possibility, and the demand for positive evidence dropped, then no holds are barred.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive scientist [[Justin L.

=== Integration ===
As a general view, this holds that while interactions are complex between influences of science, theology, politics, social, and economic concerns, the productive engagements between science and religion throughout history should be duly stressed as the norm.

Scientific and theological perspectives often coexist peacefully. Christians and some non-Christian religions have historically integrated well with scientific ideas, as in the [[ancient Egypt]]ian technological mastery applied to [[monotheistic]] ends, the flourishing of [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] under [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], and the scientific advances made by [[Islam|Muslim]] scholars during the [[Ottoman empire]]. Even many 19th-century Christian communities welcomed scientists who claimed that science was not at all concerned with discovering the ultimate nature of reality.&lt;ref name="habgood" /&gt; According to [[Lawrence M. Principe]], the [[Johns Hopkins University]] Drew Professor of the Humanities, from a historical perspective this points out that much of the current-day clashes occur between limited extremists—both religious and scientistic fundamentalists—over a very few topics, and that the movement of ideas back and forth between scientific and theological thought has been more usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |title = Science and Religion
 |publisher = The Teaching Company

Religions have also given key participation in development of modern [[universities]] and libraries; centers of learning &amp; scholarship were coincident with religious institutions – whether pagan, Muslim, or Christian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A fundamental principle of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] is the harmony of religion and science.  [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í scripture]] asserts that true [[science]] and true [[religion]] can never be in conflict. [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, stated that religion without science is superstition and that science without religion is materialism. He also admonished that true religion must conform to the conclusions of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hatcher | first = William | title = Science and the Bahá'í Faith | journal = [[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 229–53 |date=September 1979 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.1979.tb00359.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = P. |year = 1999 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |pages = 306–07 |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jbs"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mehanian | first = Courosh |author2=Friberg, Stephen R.  | year = 2003 | title = Religion and Evolution Reconciled: 'Abdu'l-Bahá's Comments on Evolution | journal = The Journal of Bahá'í studies | volume = 13 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 55–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buddhism ==
{{Main|Buddhism and science}}
[[Buddhism]] and science have been regarded as compatible by numerous authors.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Amos. (2005) ''Buddhism and Science: Breaking New Ground (review)'' Buddhist-Christian Studies – Volume 25, 2005, pp. 176–80&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophic and psychological teachings found in Buddhism share points in common with [[Enlightenment (philosophy)|modern Western scientific and philosophic thought]]. For example, Buddhism encourages the impartial investigation of nature (an activity referred to as ''[[Dhamma vicaya|Dhamma-Vicaya]]'' in the [[Pali Canon]])—the principal object of study being oneself.  Buddhism and science both show a strong emphasis on [[causality]]. However, Buddhism doesn't focus on [[materialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, B. Alan. (2003). ''Buddhism &amp; science: breaking new ground''. Columbia University Press, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], maintains that empirical scientific evidence supersedes the traditional teachings of [[Buddhism]] when the two are in conflict. In his book ''The Universe in a Single Atom'' he wrote,  "My confidence in venturing into science lies in my basic belief that as in science, so in Buddhism, understanding the nature of reality is pursued by means of critical investigation." and "If scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false," he says, "then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims."&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Jon.

Among early Christian teachers, [[Tertullian]] (c. 160–220) held a generally negative opinion of [[Greek philosophy]], while [[Origen]] (c. 185–254) regarded it much more favorably and required his students to read nearly every work available to them.&lt;ref name="Davis2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Davis | first = Edward B. | contribution = Christianity, History Of Science And Religion | year = 2003 | title = Encyclopedia of Science and Religion | editor-last = Van Huyssteen | editor-first = Wentzel | volume =  | pages = 123–27 | place = | publisher = Macmillan Reference  | isbn=978-0-02-865704-2 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Earlier attempts at reconciliation of Christianity with [[Newtonian mechanics]] appear quite different from later attempts at reconciliation with the newer scientific ideas of [[evolution]] or [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: pages 48-55 --&gt; Many early interpretations of evolution polarized themselves around a ''[[survival of the fittest|struggle for existence]].'' These ideas were significantly countered by later findings of universal [[sociobiology|patterns of biological cooperation]]. According to [[John Habgood]], all man really knows here is that the [[universe]] seems to be a mix of [[good and evil]], [[beauty]] and [[pain]], and that [[suffering]] may somehow be part of the process of creation. Habgood holds that Christians should not be surprised that suffering may be used creatively by [[God]], given their faith in the symbol of the [[Christian cross|Cross]].&lt;ref name=habgood /&gt; &lt;!-- Habgood: page 68-69 --&gt;

Modern historians of science such as [[J.L.

In their views, not only did the monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but the medieval church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many [[universities]] which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries, St. Thomas Aquinas, the Church's "model theologian", not only argued that reason is in harmony with faith, he even recognized that reason can contribute to understanding revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development. He was not unlike other medieval theologians who sought out reason in the effort to defend his faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fides et Ratio (Faith and Reason), IV |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/JP2FIDES.HTM#Ch4b |author=Pope John Paul II |date=September 1998 |accessdate=2006-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of today's scholars, such as [[Stanley Jaki]], have claimed that Christianity with its particular [[worldview]], was a crucial factor for the emergence of modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Jaki, Stanley L. The Savior of Science, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company (July 2000), {{ISBN|0-8028-4772-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

David C. Lindberg states that the widespread popular belief that the Middle Ages was a time of ignorance and superstition due to the Christian church is a "caricature". According to Lindberg, while there are some portions of the classical tradition which suggest this view, these were exceptional cases. It was common to tolerate and encourage critical thinking about the nature of the world. The relation between Christianity and science is complex and cannot be simplified to either harmony or conflict, according to Lindberg.&lt;ref&gt;David C. Lindberg, "The Medieval Church Encounters the Classical Tradition: Saint Augustine, Roger Bacon, and the Handmaiden Metaphor", in David C. Lindberg and Ronald L. Numbers, ed. ''When Science &amp; Christianity Meet'', (Chicago: University of Chicago Pr., 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Lindberg reports that "the late medieval scholar rarely experienced the coercive power of the church and would have regarded himself as free (particularly in the natural sciences) to follow reason and observation wherever they led. There was no warfare between science and the church."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in: Peters, Ted. "Science and Religion". ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' p. 8182&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Peters (theologian)|Ted Peters]] in ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' writes that although there is some truth in the "Galileo's condemnation" story but through exaggerations, it has now become "a modern myth perpetuated by those wishing to see warfare between science and religion who were allegedly persecuted by an atavistic and dogma-bound ecclesiastical authority".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Ted Peters, Science and Religion, Encyclopedia of Religion, p. 8182&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the [[Catholic Church]]'s seeming vindication of Galileo attracted much comment in the [[Galileo affair|media]].

A degree of concord between science and religion can be seen in religious belief and empirical science. The belief that God created the world and therefore humans, can lead to the view that he arranged for humans to know the world. This is underwritten by the doctrine of [[imago dei]]. In the words of [[Thomas Aquinas]], "Since human beings are said to be in the image of God in virtue of their having a nature that includes an intellect, such a nature is most in the image of God in virtue of being most able to imitate God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/#Con |title=Religion and Science (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a period "characterized by dramatic revolutions in science" and the rise of Protestant challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church via individual liberty, the authority of Christian scriptures became strongly challenged.

In recent history, the theory of [[evolution]] has been at the center of some controversy between Christianity and science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| first1=Jeffrey P. |last1=Schloss | contribution = Evolutionary theory and religious belief| editor-first1 = Philip |editor-last1 = Clayton | editor-first2 = Zachary |editor-last2= Simpson | title = The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science| pages = 187–206| publisher = Oxford University Press| place = Oxford| year = 2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_Handbook_of_Religion_and_Scie.html?id=7_Ba1sm0jP4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians who accept a literal interpretation of the [[biblical creation|biblical account of creation]] find incompatibility between [[Darwinian evolution]] and their interpretation of the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/#Sci|title=Religion and Science|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creation science]] or [[scientific creationism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Numbers|2006|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=GQ3TI5njXfIC&amp;pg=PA268 268–285]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a branch of [[creationism]] that attempts to provide scientific support for the [[Genesis creation narrative]] in the [[Book of Genesis]] and attempts to disprove generally accepted [[scientific fact]]s, [[Scientific theory|theories]] and [[Paradigm|scientific paradigms]] about the geological history of the Earth, [[cosmology]] of the early universe,

Later that year, a similar law was passed in Mississippi, and likewise, Arkansas in 1927. In 1968, these "anti-monkey" laws were struck down by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] as unconstitutional, "because they established a religious doctrine violating both the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendments]] to the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;The Origin of Rights, Roger E.

Most scientists have rejected creation science for several reasons, including that its claims do not refer to natural causes and cannot be tested. In 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled that creationism is [[religion]], not science, and cannot be advocated in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;"&lt;cite&gt;The legislative history demonstrates that the term "creation science," as contemplated by the state legislature, embraces this religious teaching.&lt;/cite&gt;" [http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0482_0578_ZS.html Edwards v.

[[Theistic evolution]] attempts to reconcile Christian beliefs and science by accepting the scientific understanding of the age of the Earth and the process of evolution. It includes a range of beliefs, including views described as [[old earth creationism|evolutionary creationism]], which accepts some findings of modern science but also upholds classical religious teachings about God and creation in Christian context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Francis S.|title=The Language of God : A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief|year=2007|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=1-4165-4274-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reconciliation in Britain in the early 20th century ===
In ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain'', historian of biology [[Peter J. Bowler]] argues that in contrast to the conflicts between science and religion in the U.S. in the 1920s (most famously the [[Scopes Trial]]), during this period Great Britain experienced a concerted effort at reconciliation, championed by intellectually conservative scientists, supported by liberal theologians but opposed by younger scientists and secularists and [[British Conservative Evangelicalism|conservative Christians]]. These attempts at reconciliation fell apart in the 1930s due to increased social tensions, moves towards [[neo-orthodox]] theology and the acceptance of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-twentieth-century Britain'', [[Peter J. Bowler]], 2001, [[University of Chicago Press]], {{ISBN|0-226-06858-7}}. Front dustcover flap material&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, several [[ecumenical]] organizations promoting a harmony between science and Christianity were founded, most notably the [[American Scientific Affiliation]], [[Biologos Foundation|The Biologos Foundation]], [[Christians in Science]], [[Society of Ordained Scientists|The Society of Ordained Scientists]], and [[Veritas Forum|The Veritas Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James C. Peterson|title=Genetic Turning Points: The Ethics of Human Genetic Intervention|year=2001|publisher=[[Wm. B.

It currently has about two thousand members, all of whom affirm the Apostles' Creed as part of joining the association, and most of whom hold Ph.D.s in the natural sciences. Their active journal is ''[[Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith]]''. Across the Atlantic, the Society of Ordained Scientists and Christians in Science are similar affiliation in Great Britain.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Catholicism ===
{{See also|Catholic Church and evolution|Catholic Church and science}}

While refined and clarified over the centuries, the [[Roman Catholic]] position on the relationship between science and religion is one of harmony, and has maintained the teaching of [[natural law]] as set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]]. For example, regarding scientific study such as that of evolution, the church's unofficial position is an example of [[theistic evolution]], stating that faith and scientific findings regarding human evolution are not in conflict, though humans are regarded as a special creation, and that the existence of God is required to explain both [[monogenism]] and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] component of human origins. Catholic schools have included all manners of scientific study in their curriculum for many centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13554b.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher=New Advent |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo once stated "The intention of the [[Holy Spirit]] is to teach us how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Cambridge Companion to Galileo|last= Machamer|first= Peter|year= 1998|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|location= |isbn= 0-521-58841-3|page= 306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981  [[John Paul II]], then [[pope]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], spoke of the relationship this way: "The Bible itself speaks to us of the origin of the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use at the time of the writer".&lt;ref&gt;Pope [[John Paul II]], 3 October 1981 to the Pontifical Academy of Science, [http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/JP2COSM.HTM "Cosmology and Fundamental Physics"]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of a biblical world view on early modern science ===
[[File:Gossuin de Metz - L'image du monde - BNF Fr. 574 fo42 - miniature.jpg|thumb|Medieval artistic illustration of the [[spherical Earth]] in a 13th-century copy of ''[[Gautier de Metz|L'Image du monde]]'' (c. 1246)]]
According to [[Andrew Dickson White]]'s ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' from the 19th century, a biblical world view affected negatively the progress of science through time. Dickinson also argues that immediately following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] matters were even worse. The interpretations of Scripture by Luther and Calvin became as sacred to their followers as the Scripture itself. For instance, when [[Georg Calixtus]] ventured, in interpreting the Psalms, to question the accepted belief that "the waters above the heavens" were contained in a vast receptacle upheld by a solid vault, he was bitterly denounced as heretical.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Dickson White. ''[[A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom]]'' (Kindle Locations 1970–2132)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, much of the scholarship in which the conflict thesis was originally based is considered to be inaccurate. For instance, the claim that early Christians rejected scientific findings by the Greco-Romans is false, since the "handmaiden" view of secular studies was seen to shed light on theology.  This view was widely adapted throughout the early medieval period and afterwards by theologians (such as Augustine) and ultimately resulted in fostering interest in knowledge about nature through time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|chapter=Myth 1: That the Rise of Christianity was Responsible for the Demise of Ancient Science|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|pages=15–18|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the claim that people of the [[Middle Ages]] widely believed that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]] was first propagated in the same period that originated the conflict thesis&lt;ref name="flat"&gt;Jeffrey Russell. ''Inventing the Flat Earth: Columbus and Modern Historians''. Praeger Paperback; New Edition (January 30, 1997). {{ISBN|0-275-95904-X}}; {{ISBN|978-0-275-95904-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is still very common in popular culture. Modern scholars regard this claim as mistaken, as the contemporary historians of science [[David C. Lindberg]] and [[Ronald L. Numbers]] write: "there was scarcely a Christian scholar of the Middle Ages who did not acknowledge [earth's] sphericity and even know its approximate circumference."&lt;ref name="flat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from [[David C.

Studies in the History of Science and Christianity.&lt;/ref&gt; From the fall of Rome to the time of Columbus, all major scholars and many vernacular writers interested in the physical shape of the earth held a spherical view with the exception of Lactantius and Cosmas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cormack|first=Leslie|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|chapter=Myth 3: That Medieval Christians Taught that the Earth was Flat|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|pages=28–34|editor=Ronald Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. Floris Cohen]] argued for a biblical Protestant, but not excluding Catholicism, influence on the early development of modern science.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wu8b2NAqnb0C ''The Scientific Revolution: A Historiographical Inquiry''], [[H. Floris Cohen]], University of Chicago Press 1994, 680 pages, {{ISBN|0-226-11280-2}}, pp. 308–21&lt;/ref&gt; He presented Dutch historian [[Reijer Hooykaas|R. Hooykaas]]' argument that a biblical world-view holds all the necessary antidotes for the hubris of Greek rationalism: a respect for manual labour, leading to more experimentation and [[empiricism]], and a supreme God that left nature open to emulation and manipulation.&lt;ref name=cohen /&gt; It supports the idea early modern science rose due to a combination of Greek and biblical thought.&lt;ref&gt;"Finally, and most importantly, Hooykaas does not of course claim that the Scientific Revolution was exclusively the work of Protestant scholars."  Cohen (1994) p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1994) p. 313. Hooykaas puts it more poetically: "Metaphorically speaking, whereas the bodily ingredients of science may have been Greek, its vitamins and hormones were biblical."&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxford historian [[Peter Harrison (historian)|Peter Harrison]] is another who has argued that a biblical worldview was significant for the development of modern science.  Harrison contends that Protestant approaches to the book of scripture had significant, if largely unintended, consequences for the interpretation of the book of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, ''The Bible, Protestantism, and the Rise of Natural Science'' (Cambridge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; {{Page needed|date=July 2013}}  Harrison has also suggested that literal readings of the Genesis narratives of the Creation and Fall motivated and legitimated scientific activity in seventeenth-century England.  For many of its seventeenth-century practitioners, science was imagined to be a means of restoring a human dominion over nature that had been lost as a consequence of the Fall.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, ''The Fall of Man and the Foundations of Science'' (Cambridge, 2007); see also Charles Webster, ''The Great Instauration'' (London: Duckworth, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2013}}

Historian and professor of religion [[Eugene Marion Klaaren|Eugene M. Klaaren]] holds that "a belief in divine creation" was central to an emergence of science in seventeenth-century England. The philosopher [[Michael Foster (philosopher)|Michael Foster]] has published analytical philosophy connecting Christian doctrines of creation with empiricism. Historian William B. Ashworth has argued against the historical notion of distinctive mind-sets and the idea of Catholic and Protestant sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hs2edDIGCqEC|title=God and Nature|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians James R. Jacob and Margaret C. Jacob have argued for a linkage between seventeenth century [[Anglican]] intellectual transformations and influential English scientists (e.g., [[Robert Boyle]] and [[Isaac Newton]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compilerpress.atfreeweb.com/Anno%20Jacob%20&amp;%20Jacob%20Anglican%20Fdn%20of%20Modern%20Science.htm The Anglican Origins of Modern Science], [[Isis (journal)|Isis]], Volume 71, Issue 2, June 1980, 251–67; this is also noted on p. 366 of ''Science and Religion'', [[John Hedley Brooke]], 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dillenberger]] and [[Christopher B. Kaiser]] have written theological surveys, which also cover additional interactions occurring in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Dillenberger]], ''Protestant Thought and Natural Science'' ([[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher B. Kaiser]], ''Creation and the History of Science'' ([[Eerdmans]], 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher of Religion, Richard Jones, has written a philosophical critique of the "dependency thesis" which assumes that modern science emerged from Christian sources and doctrines. Though he acknowledges that modern science emerged in a religious framework, that Christianity greatly elevated the importance of science by sanctioning and religiously legitimizing it in the medieval period, and that Christianity created a favorable social context for it to grow;  he argues that direct Christian beliefs or doctrines were not primary sources of scientific pursuits by natural philosophers, nor was Christianity, in and of itself, exclusively or directly necessary in developing or practicing modern science.&lt;ref name="glory rich jones" /&gt;

[[Oxford University]] historian and theologian [[John Hedley Brooke]] wrote that "when natural philosophers referred to ''laws'' of nature, they were not glibly choosing that metaphor. Laws were the result of legislation by an intelligent deity. Thus the philosopher [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) insisted that he was discovering the "laws that God has put into nature." Later Newton would declare that the regulation of the solar system presupposed the "counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Hedley Brooke]], ''Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives'', 1991, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-23961-3}}, p. 19.  See also Peter Harrison, "Newtonian Science, Miracles, and the Laws of Nature", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 56 (1995), 531–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Ronald L. Numbers]] stated that this thesis "received a boost" from mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s ''Science and the Modern World'' (1925). Numbers has also argued, "Despite the manifest shortcomings of the claim that Christianity gave birth to science—most glaringly, it ignores or minimizes the contributions of ancient Greeks and medieval Muslims—it too, refuses to succumb to the death it deserves."&lt;ref&gt;''Science and Christianity in pulpit and pew'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2007, [[Ronald L. Numbers]], pp. 4, 138 n. 3 where Numbers specifically raises his concerns with regards to the works of [[Michael B. Foster]], [[Reijer Hooykaas]], [[Eugene M. Klaaren]], and [[Stanley L. Jaki]]&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist [[Rodney Stark]] of [[Baylor University]], argued in contrast that "Christian theology was essential for the rise of science."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodney Stark]], ''For the glory of God: how monotheism led to reformations, science, witch-hunts and the end of slavery'', 2003, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0-691-11436-6}}, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Protestantism had an important influence on science. According to the [[Merton Thesis]] there was a  positive [[correlation]] between the rise of [[Puritanism]] and [[Protestant]] [[Pietism]] on the one hand and early [[experimental science]] on the other.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003&gt;[[Piotr Sztompka|Sztompka, Piotr]] (2003), "Robert King Merton", in [[George Ritzer|Ritzer, George]], ''[[The Blackwell Companion to Major Contemporary Social Theorists]]''. Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford: Blackwell, p. 13, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-0595-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Merton Thesis has two separate parts: Firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental techniques and [[methodology]]; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in 17th-century [[England]] and the religious [[demography]] of the [[Royal Society]] (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a [[correlation]] between Protestantism and the scientific values.&lt;ref name=gregory1998&gt;Gregory,  Andrew (1998), Handout for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The Scientific Revolution&lt;/ref&gt; In his theory, [[Robert K. Merton]] focused on English Puritanism and [[Spener|German Pietism]] as having been responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. Merton explained that the connection between [[religious affiliation]] and interest in science was the result of a significant synergy between the [[ascetic]] Protestant values and those of modern science.&lt;ref name=becker1992&gt;Becker, George (1992), ''The Merton Thesis: Oetinger and German Pietism, a significant negative case,'' [[Sociological Forum]] (Springer) 7 (4), pp. 642–60&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to study [[God]]'s influence on the world and thus providing a religious justification for scientific research.&lt;ref name=sztompka2003 /&gt;

== Confucianism and traditional Chinese religion ==
The historical process of Confucianism has largely been antipathic towards scientific discovery. However the religio-philosophical system itself is more neutral on the subject than such an analysis might suggest. In his writings On Heaven, [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] espoused a proto-scientific world view.&lt;ref&gt;Cua, Antonio S. "The Quasi-Empirical Aspect of Hsün-tzu's Philosophy of Human Nature." PEW 28 (1978), 3–19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the Han Synthesis the more anti-empirical [[Mencius]] was favored and combined with [[Daoist]] skepticism regarding the nature of reality. Likewise, during the Medieval period, [[Zhu Xi]] argued against technical investigation and specialization proposed by Chen Liang.&lt;ref&gt;Tillman, Hoyt Cleveland.  "Utilitarian Confucianism : Chʻen Liang'' challenge to Chu Hsi" Cambridge, Mass.: Council on East Asian Studies, Harvard University: Distributed by Harvard University Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; After contact with the West, scholars such as [[Wang Fuzhi]] would rely on Buddhist/Daoist skepticism to denounce all science as a subjective pursuit limited by humanity's fundamental ignorance of the true nature of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Alison Harley. "Man and Nature in the Philosophical Thought of Wang Fu-Chih." Publications on Asia of the Henry M. Jackson School of International Studies, University of Washington, no. 41. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[May Fourth Movement]], attempts to modernize Confucianism and reconcile it with scientific understanding were attempted by many scholars including [[Feng Youlan]] and [[Xiong Shili]]. Given the close relationship that Confucianism shares with Buddhism, many of the same arguments used to reconcile Buddhism with science also readily translate to Confucianism. However, modern scholars have also attempted to define the relationship between science and Confucianism on Confucianism's own terms and the results have usually led to the conclusion that Confucianism and science are fundamentally compatible.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Evelyn Tucker "Confucianism and Ecology: The Interrelation of Heaven, Earth, and Humans (Religions of the World and Ecology)" Center for the Study of World Religions (August 15, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], the dividing line between objective sciences and spiritual knowledge (''adhyatma vidya'') is a linguistic paradox.&lt;ref name="Mitcham"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics|author=Carl Mitcham|publisher=Macmillan Reference|year=2005|page=917|isbn=0-02-865831-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindu scholastic activities and ancient Indian scientific advancements were so interconnected that many [[Hindu scriptures]] are also ancient scientific manuals and vice versa. In 1835, English was made the primary language for teaching in higher education in India, exposing Hindu scholars to Western secular ideas; this started [[Hindu Renaissance|a renaissance regarding religious and philosophical thought]].&lt;ref name="David Gosling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gosling|first=David L.|title=Darwin and the Hindu Tradition: "Does What Goes Around Come Around?"|journal=Zygon|year=2011|volume=46|issue=2|pages=345–69|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9744.2010.01177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hindu sages maintained that logical argument and rational proof using [[Nyaya]] is the way to obtain correct knowledge.&lt;ref name="Mitcham" /&gt; The scientific level of understanding focuses on how things work and from where they originate, while Hinduism strives to understand the ultimate purposes for the existence of living things.&lt;ref name="David Gosling" /&gt; To obtain and broaden the knowledge of the world for spiritual perfection, many refer to the Bhāgavata for guidance because it draws upon a scientific and theological dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosling|first1=David|title=Science and the Hindu Tradition: Compatibility or Conflict?|journal=Hinduism and Science: Contemporary Considerations|date=September 2012|volume=47|issue=3|pages=576–77|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com.authenticate.library.duq.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=664a012b-631b-40dc-8433-ab92d3cc478f%40sessionmgr4004&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=4204|accessdate=2014-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hinduism offers methods to correct and transform itself in course of time. For instance, Hindu views on the development of life include a range of viewpoints in regards to [[evolution]], [[creationism]], and the [[origin of life]] within the traditions of [[Hinduism]]. For instance, it has been suggested that Wallace-Darwininan evolutionary thought was a part of Hindu thought centuries before modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Sunil|title=Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Volume 3)|year=1999|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=688|quote=The Hindus were Spinozaites more than two thousand years before the existence of Spinoza; and Darwinians many centuries before our time, and before any word like 'evolution' existed in any language of the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shankara and the Sāmkhya did not have a problem with the theory of evolution, but instead, argued about the existence of God and what happened after death. These two distinct groups argued among each other's philosophies because of their sacred texts, not the idea of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gosling|first1=David|title=Science and the Hindu Tradition: Compatibility or Conflict?|journal=Hinduism and Science: Contemporary Considerations|date=September 2012|volume=47|issue=3|page=577}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the publication of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', many Hindus were eager to connect their scriptures to Darwinism, finding similarities between Brahma's creation, Vishnu's incarnations, and evolution theories.&lt;ref name="David Gosling" /&gt;

[[Samkhya]], the oldest school of [[Hindu philosophy]] prescribes a particular method to analyze knowledge. According to Samkhya, all knowledge is possible through three means of valid knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Sarma, Deepak (2011) "''Classical Indian Philosophy: A Reader''" p. 167 Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Samkhya Karika'', ''śloka''4&lt;/ref&gt; –
# ''Pratyakṣa'' or ''Dṛṣṭam'' – direct sense perception,
# ''Anumāna'' – [[logic]]al [[inference]] and
# ''Śabda'' or ''Āptavacana'' – verbal testimony.

[[Nyaya]], the Hindu school of logic, accepts all these 3 means and in addition accepts one more – ''[[Upamāna]]'' (comparison).

The accounts of the emergence of life within the universe vary in description, but classically the [[deity]] called [[Brahma]], from a [[Trimurti]] of three deities also including [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], is described as performing the act of 'creation', or more specifically of 'propagating life within the universe' with the other two deities being responsible for 'preservation' and 'destruction' (of the universe) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/beliefs/intro_1.shtml |title=Religion &amp; Ethics-Hinduism|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect some Hindu schools do not treat the scriptural [[Creation myth#Hindu|creation myth]] literally and often the creation stories themselves do not go into specific detail, thus leaving open the possibility of incorporating at least some theories in support of evolution. Some Hindus find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]], namely the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/jct/science.html | title=Science and spirituality: Any Points of Contact?

As per [[Vedas]], another explanation for the creation is based on the [[Mahābhūta|five elements]]: earth, water, fire, air and [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].
The Hindu religion traces its beginnings to the sacred Vedas. Everything that is established in the Hindu faith such as the gods and goddesses, doctrines, chants, spiritual insights, etc. flow from the poetry of [[Vedic hymns]]. The Vedas offer an honor to the sun and moon, water and wind, and to the order in Nature that is universal.

== Islam ==
{{Main|Islam and science}}
{{See also|Science in the medieval Islamic world}}

From an Islamic standpoint, science, the study of [[nature]], is considered to be linked to the concept of ''Tawhid'' (the Oneness of God), as are all other branches of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007"&gt;Muzaffar Iqbal (2007). Science &amp; Islam. Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], nature is not seen as a separate entity, but rather as an integral part of Islam's holistic outlook on God, humanity, and the world. The Islamic view of science and nature is continuous with that of religion and God. This link implies a sacred aspect to the pursuit of scientific knowledge by Muslims, as nature itself is viewed in the Qur'an as a compilation of signs pointing to the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;2. Toshihiko Izutsu (1964). God and Man in the Koran. Weltansckauung. Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt; It was with this understanding that science was studied and understood in Islamic civilizations, specifically during the eighth to sixteenth centuries, prior to the colonization of the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;3.	Situating Arabic Science: Locality versus Essence (A.I. Sabra)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Briffault]], in ''The Making of Humanity'', asserts that the very existence of science, as it is understood in the modern sense, is rooted in the scientific thought and knowledge that emerged in Islamic civilizations during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Briffault (1928).

With the decline of Islamic Civilizations in the late Middle Ages and the rise of Europe, the Islamic scientific tradition shifted into a new period. Institutions that had existed for centuries in the Muslim world looked to the new scientific institutions of European powers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}  This changed the practice of science in the Muslim world, as Islamic scientists had to confront the western approach to scientific learning, which was based on a different philosophy of nature.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007" /&gt; From the time of this initial upheaval of the Islamic scientific tradition to the present day, Muslim scientists and scholars have developed a spectrum of viewpoints on the place of scientific learning within the context of Islam, none of which are universally accepted or practiced.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Seyyid Hossein Nasr. "Islam and Modern Science"&lt;/ref&gt; However, most maintain the view that the acquisition of knowledge and scientific pursuit in general is not in disaccord with Islamic thought and religious belief.&lt;ref name="Muzaffar Iqbal 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== Ahmadiyya ===
{{Further|Ahmadiyya views on evolution}}
The [[Ahmadiyya]] movement emphasize that "there is no contradiction between [[Islam and science]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} For example, Ahmadi Muslims universally accept in principle the process of evolution, albeit divinely guided, and actively promote it. Over the course of several decades the movement has issued various publications in support of the scientific concepts behind the process of evolution, and frequently engages in promoting how religious scriptures, such as the Qur'an, supports the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://itl-usa.org/ahmadi/ahmadi13.html |title=Jesus and the Indian Messiah – 13.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Holy Quran]] directs attention towards science, time and again, rather than evoking prejudice against it. The Quran has never advised against studying science, lest the reader should become a non-believer; because it has no such fear or concern. The Holy Quran is not worried that if people will learn the laws of nature its spell will break. The Quran has not prevented people from science, rather it states, "Say, 'Reflect on what is happening in the heavens and the earth.'"

== Jainism ==
{{Main|Jainism and non-creationism}}
[[Jainism]] does not support belief in a [[creator deity]]. According to Jain doctrine, the [[universe]] and its constituents – soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a [[static universe]] similar to that of [[Epicureanism]] and [[Steady State theory|steady state cosmological model]]). All the constituents and actions are governed by [[Universal Law|universal]] [[natural laws]]. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of [[conservation of mass]]). Similarly, the [[soul]] of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}&lt;ref&gt;Nayanar (2005b), p. 190, Gāthā 10.310&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain theory of [[Causality|causation]] holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and hence a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires, achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.

Through the ages, [[Jain Philosophy#Jain philosophers|Jain philosophers]] have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as ''[[Nastika|nastika darsana]]'' or [[Atheism|atheist philosophy]] by the rival [[Indian philosophy|religious philosophies]]. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E.

== Perspectives from the scientific community ==

=== History ===
{{Further|List of Jewish scientists and philosophers|List of Christian thinkers in science|List of Muslim scientists|List of atheists (science and technology)|}}
In the 17th century, founders of the [[Royal Society]] largely held conventional and orthodox religious views, and a number of them were prominent Churchmen.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harrison, 'Religion, the Royal Society, and the Rise of Science', ''Theology and Science'', 6 (2008), 255–71.&lt;/ref&gt;  While theological issues that had the potential to be divisive were typically excluded from formal discussions of the early Society, many of its fellows nonetheless believed that their scientific activities provided support for traditional religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Sprat, ''The History of the Royal Society'' (London, 1667)&lt;/ref&gt;  Clerical involvement in the Royal Society remained high until the mid-nineteenth century, when science became more professionalised.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Turner, 'The Victorian Conflict between Science and Religion: A Professional Dimension', ''Isis'', 49 (1978) 356–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] supported the compatibility of some interpretations of religion with science. In "Science, Philosophy and Religion, A Symposium" published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York in 1941, Einstein stated:
{{quotation|Accordingly, a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance and loftiness of those superpersonal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation. They exist with the same necessity and matter-of-factness as he himself. In this sense religion is the age-old endeavor of mankind to become clearly and completely conscious of these values and goals and constantly to strengthen and extend their effect. If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible. For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action: it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts. According to this interpretation the well-known conflicts between religion and science in the past must all be ascribed to a misapprehension of the situation which has been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/einstein/einsci.htm |title=Albert Einstein:Religion and Science |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Einstein thus expresses views of [[ethical non-naturalism]] (contrasted to [[ethical naturalism]]).

Prominent modern scientists who are [[Atheism|atheists]] include evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] and Nobel Prize–winning physicist [[Steven Weinberg]]. Prominent scientists advocating religious belief include Nobel Prize–winning physicist and [[United Church of Christ]] member [[Charles Townes]], evangelical Christian and past head of the [[Human Genome Project]] [[Francis Collins]], and climatologist [[John T. Houghton]].&lt;ref name=east1997 /&gt;

In 1916, 1,000 leading American scientists were randomly chosen from ''American Men of Science'' and 42% believed God existed, 42% disbelieved, and 17% had doubts/did not know; however when the study was replicated 80 years later using ''American Men and Women of Science'' in 1996, results were very much the same with 39% believing God exists, 45% disbelieved, and 15% had doubts/did not know.&lt;ref name="east1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson, E. J. 1997" /&gt; In the same 1996 survey, for scientists in the fields of biology, mathematics, and physics/astronomy, belief in a god that is "in intellectual and affective communication with humankind" was most popular among [[mathematician]]s (about 45%) and least popular among [[physicist]]s (about 22%). In total, in terms of belief toward a personal god and personal immortality, about 60% of [[United States]] scientists in these fields expressed either disbelief or agnosticism and about 40% expressed belief.&lt;ref name="Larson, E. J. 1997" /&gt; This compared with 62.9% in 1914 and 33% in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Edward J.|last2=Witham|first2=Larry|title=Leading scientists still reject God|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v394/n6691/full/394313a0.html#a1|website=Nature|accessdate=27 October 2017|pages=313–313|language=en|doi=10.1038/28478|date=23 July 1998|bibcode=1998Natur.394..313L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey conducted between 2005 and 2007 by [[Elaine Howard Ecklund]] of [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]] of 1,646 natural and social science professors at 21 US research universities found that, in terms of belief in God or a higher power, more than 60% expressed either disbelief or agnosticism and more than 30% expressed belief. More specifically, nearly 34% answered "I do not believe in God" and about 30% answered "I do not know if there is a God and there is no way to find out."&lt;ref name="Ecklund study summary"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine|title=Religion and Spirituality among University Scientists|url=http://religion.ssrc.org/reforum/Ecklund.pdf|publisher=Social Science Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same study, 28% said they believed in God and 8% believed in a higher power that was not God.&lt;ref name="Ecklund scientists study"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ecklund|first=Elaine Howard|title=Science vs. Religion : What Scientists Really Think|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-539298-2|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ecklund stated that scientists were often able to consider themselves spiritual without religion or belief in god.&lt;ref name=physorgeck&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.physorg.com/pdf5785.pdf|publisher=Physorg.com|title=Natural scientists are less likely to believe in God than are social scientists}} "Many scientists see themselves as having a spirituality not attached to a particular religious tradition. Some scientists who don't believe in God see themselves as very spiritual people. They have a way outside of themselves that they use to understand the meaning of life."&lt;/ref&gt; Ecklund and Scheitle concluded, from their study, that the individuals from non-religious backgrounds disproportionately had self-selected into scientific professions and that the assumption that becoming a scientist necessarily leads to loss of religion is untenable since the study did not strongly support the idea that scientists had dropped religious identities due to their scientific training.&lt;ref name="ecklund sheitle Buffalo univ"&gt;{{cite web|last=Donovan|first=Patricia|title=Scientists May Not Be Very Religious, but Science May Not Be to Blame|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2007/06/8732.html|publisher=University at Buffalo New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, factors such as upbringing, age, and family size were significant influences on religious identification since those who had religious upbringing were more likely to be religious and those who had a non-religious upbringing were more likely to not be religious.&lt;ref name="Ecklund study summary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ecklund sheitle Buffalo univ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ecklund Scientist Demographics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ecklund|first1=Elaine Howard|last2=Scheitle|first2=Christopher P.|title=Religion among Academic Scientists: Distinctions, Disciplines, and Demographics|journal=Social Problems|date=May 2007|volume=54|issue=2|pages=289–307|doi=10.1525/sp.2007.54.2.289}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors also found little difference in religiosity between social and natural scientists.&lt;ref name="Ecklund Scientist Demographics" /&gt;

Many studies have been conducted in the [[United States]] and have generally found that scientists are less likely to believe in God than are the rest of the population. Precise definitions and statistics vary, with some studies concluding that about {{frac|1|3}} of scientists in the U.S. are atheists, {{frac|1|3}} agnostic, and {{frac|1|3}} have some belief in God (although some might be [[deistic]], for example).&lt;ref name="east1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson, E.

In terms of perceptions, most social and natural scientists from 21 American universities did not perceive conflict between science and religion, while 37% did.

A 2009 report by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that members of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) were "much less religious than the general public," with 51% believing in some form of deity or higher power.

According to the poll, just over half of scientists (51%) believe in some form of deity or higher power; specifically, 33% of scientists say they believe in God, while 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power.|accessdate=2011-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 48% say they have a religious affiliation, equal to the number who say they are not affiliated with any religious tradition. 17% were atheists, 11% were agnostics, 20% were nothing in particular, 8% were Jewish, 10% were Catholic, 16% were Protestant, 4% were Evangelical, 10% were other religion. The survey also found younger scientists to be "substantially more likely than their older counterparts to say they believe in God". Among the surveyed fields, chemists were the most likely to say they believe in God.&lt;ref name="people-press.org" /&gt;

Elaine Ecklund conducted a study from 2011 to 2014 involving the general US population, including rank and file scientists, in collaboration with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). The study noted that 76% of the scientists identified with a religious tradition. 85% of evangelical scientists had no doubts about the existence of God, compared to 35% of the whole scientific population. In terms of religion and science, 85% of evangelical scientists saw no conflict (73% collaboration, 12% independence), while 75% of the whole scientific population saw no conflict (40% collaboration, 35% independence).&lt;ref name="Ecklund AAAS" /&gt;

Religious beliefs of US professors were examined using a nationally representative sample of more than 1,400 professors. They found that in the social sciences: 23% did not believe in God, 16% did not know if God existed, 43% believed God existed, and 16% believed in a higher power. Out of the natural sciences: 20% did not believe in God, 33% did not know if God existed, 44% believed God existed, and 4% believed in a higher power. Overall, out of the whole study: 10% were atheists, 13% were agnostic, 19% believe in a higher power, 4% believe in God some of the time, 17% had doubts but believed in God, 35% believed in God and had no doubts.&lt;ref name=gross2009&gt;Neil Gross and Solon Simmons (2009).

Farr Curlin, a [[University of Chicago]] Instructor in Medicine and a member of the [[MacLean Center for Clinical Medical Ethics]], noted in a study that doctors tend to be science-minded religious people. He helped author a study that "found that 76 percent of doctors believe in God and 59 percent believe in some sort of afterlife." Furthermore, "90 percent of doctors in the United States attend religious services at least occasionally, compared to 81 percent of all adults." He reasoned, "The responsibility to care for those who are suffering and the rewards of helping those in need resonate throughout most religious traditions."&lt;ref name="chronicle.uchicago.edu" /&gt;

Physicians in the United States, by contrast, are much more religious than scientists, with 76% stating a belief in God.&lt;ref name="chronicle.uchicago.edu"&gt;Easton, John.

According to the Study of Secularism in Society and Culture's report on 1,100 scientists in India: 66% are Hindu, 14% did not report a religion, 10% are atheist/no religion, 3% are Muslim, 3% are Christian, 4% are Buddhist, Sikh or other.&lt;ref name="Keysar India"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keysar|first1=Ariela|last2=Kosmin|first2=Barry|title=Worldviews and Opinions of Scientists: India 2007-2008|date=2008|publisher=Study of Secularism in Society and Culture (ISSSC)|location=Trinity College|url=https://commons.trincoll.edu/worldviewsofscientists/report/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 39% have a belief in a god, 6% have belief in a god sometimes, 30% do not believe in a god but believe in a higher power, 13% do not know if there is a god, and 12% do not believe in a god.&lt;ref name="Keysar India" /&gt; 49% believe in the efficacy of prayer, 90% strongly agree or somewhat agree with approving degrees in Ayurvedic medicine. Furthermore, the term "secularism" is understood to have diverse and simultaneous meanings among Indian scientists: 93% believe it to be tolerance of religions and philosophies, 83% see it as involving separation of church and state, 53% see it as not identifying with religious traditions, 40% see it as absence of religious beliefs, and 20% see it as atheism. Accordingly, 75% of Indian scientists had a "secular" outlook in terms of being tolerant of other religions.&lt;ref name="Keysar India" /&gt;

According to the Religion Among Scientists in International Context (RASIC) study on 1,581 scientists from the United Kingdom and 1,763 scientists from India, along with 200 interviews: 65% of U.K. scientists identified as nonreligious and only 6% of Indian scientists identify as nonreligious, 12% of scientists in the U.K. attend religious services on a regular basis and 32% of scientists in India do.&lt;ref name="Ecklund UK Indian"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCaig|first1=Amy|title=Indian scientists significantly more religious than UK scientists|url=http://news.rice.edu/2014/09/24/indian-scientists-significantly-more-religious-than-uk-scientists/|website=Rice University News|publisher=Rice University|date=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the Indian scientists, 73% of scientists responded that there are basic truths in many religions, 27% said they believe in God and 38% expressed belief in a higher power of some kind.&lt;ref name="Ecklund UK Indian" /&gt; In terms of perceptions of conflict between science and religion, less than half of both U.K. scientists (38%) and Indian scientists (18%) perceived conflict between religion and science.&lt;ref name="Ecklund UK Indian" /&gt;

According to Renny Thomas' study on Indian scientists, atheistic scientists in India called themselves atheists even while accepting that their lifestyle is very much a part of tradition and religion. Thus, they differ from Western atheists in that for them following the lifestyle of a religion is not antithetical to atheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Renny|title=Atheism and Unbelief among Indian Scientists: Towards an Anthropology of Atheism(s)|journal=Society and Culture in South Asia|date=27 December 2016|volume=3|issue=1|pages=45–67|doi=10.1177/2393861716674292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overall summary===
{{See|Conflict thesis#Modern views}}

Over time, scientists and historians have moved away from the conflict thesis and toward compatibility theses (either the integration thesis or non-overlapping magisteria). Many experts have now adopted a "complexity thesis" that combines several other models,&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Richard H. (2011). For the Glory of God : The Role of Christianity in the Rise and Development of Modern Science. University Press of America. Pg. 139. {{ISBN|9780761855668}}.&lt;/ref&gt; further at the expense of the conflict thesis.

Global studies which have pooled data on religion and science from 1981–2001, have noted that countries with high religiosity also have stronger faith in science, while less religious countries have more skepticism of the impact of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norris|first=Pippa|title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-64837-1|edition=2nd|author2=Ronald Inglehart |pages=67–68|quote=Instead, as is clearly shown in Figure 3.3, societies with greater faith in science also often have ''stronger'' religious beliefs." and "Indeed, the secular postindustrial societies, exemplified by the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, prove most skeptical toward the impact of science and technology, and this is in accordance with the countries where the strongest public disquiet has been expressed about certain contemporary scientific developments such as the use of genetically modified organisms, biotechnological cloning, and nuclear power. Interestingly, again the United States displays distinctive attitudes compared with similar European nations, showing greater faith in both God and scientific progress.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States is noted there as distinctive because of greater faith in both God and scientific progress. Other research cites the [[National Science Foundation]]'s finding that America has more favorable public attitudes towards science than Europe, Russia, and Japan despite differences in levels of religiosity in these cultures.&lt;ref name="global public science"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keeter|first=Scott|title=The Culture of Science: How the Public Relates to Science Across the Globe|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-415-87369-7|author2=Smith, Gregory |author3=Masci, David |pages=336, 345–47|chapter=Religious Belief and Attitudes about Science in the United States|quote=The United States is perhaps the most religious out of the advanced industrial democracies." ; "In fact, large majorities of the traditionally religious American nevertheless hold very positive views of science and scientists. Even people who accept a strict creationist view, regarding the origins of life are mostly favorable towards science." ; "Our review of three important issues on the public policy agenda in the United States suggest that although there is a potential for broad religiously based conflict over science, the scope of this conflict is limited. Only on one issue does a significant portion of the public deny strong consensus for religious reasons: evolution. The significance of this disagreement should not be understated, but it is decidedly unrepresentative of the broader set of scientific controversies and issues. As already noted, it is difficult to find any other major policy issues on which there are strong religious objections to scientific research. Religious concerns do arise in connection with a number of areas of life sciences research, such as the effort to develop medical therapies from embryonic stem cells. But these are not rooted in disputes about the truth of scientific research, and can be found across the spectrum of religious sentiment." ; "According to the National Science Foundation, public attitudes about science are more favorable in the United States than in Europe, Russia, and Japan, despite great differences across these cultures in level of religiosity (National Science Foundation, 2008).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted on adolescents from Christian schools in Northern Ireland, noted a positive relationship between attitudes towards Christianity and science once attitudes towards [[scientism]] and creationism were accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Francis|first=Leslie J.|author2=Greer, John E. |title=Shaping Adolescents' Attitudes towards Science and Religion in Northern Ireland: The role of scientism, creationism and denominational schools|journal=Research in Science &amp; Technological Education|date=1 May 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=39–53|doi=10.1080/02635140120046213|bibcode = 2001RSTEd..19...39J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on people from Sweden concludes that though the Swedes are among the most non-religious, paranormal beliefs are prevalent among both the young and adult populations. This is likely due to a loss of confidence in institutions such as the Church and Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sjodin|first1=Ulf|title=The Swedes and the Paranormal|journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion|date=2002|volume=17|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning specific topics like creationism, it is not an exclusively American phenomenon. A poll on adult Europeans revealed that 40% believed in naturalistic evolution, 21% in theistic evolution, 20% in special creation, and 19% are undecided; with the highest concentrations of young earth creationists in Switzerland (21%), Austria (20%), Germany (18%).&lt;ref name="Numbers Internat.

Creationism" /&gt;

According to a 2015 Pew Research Center Study on the public perceptions on science, people's perceptions on conflict with science have more to do with their perceptions of other people's beliefs than their own personal beliefs. For instance, the majority of people with a religious affiliation (68%) saw no conflict between their own personal religious beliefs and science while the majority of those without a religious affiliation (76%) perceived science and religion to be in conflict.&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Funk|first1=Cary|last2=Alper|first2=Becka|title=Religion and Science: Highly Religious Americans are less likely than others to see Conflict between Faith and Science.|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/10/22/science-and-religion/|website=Pew Research Center|publisher=Pew|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study noted that people who are not affiliated with any religion, also known as "religiously unaffiliated", often have supernatural beliefs and spiritual practices despite them not being affiliated with any religion&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also that "just one-in-six religiously unaffiliated adults (16%) say their own religious beliefs conflict with science."&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt; Furthermore, the study observed, "The share of all adults who perceive a conflict between science and their own religious beliefs has declined somewhat in recent years, from 36% in 2009 to 30% in 2014. Among those who are affiliated with a religion, the share of people who say there is a conflict between science and their personal religious beliefs dropped from 41% to 34% during this period."&lt;ref name="2015 Pew Perceptions" /&gt;

The 2013 MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins examined the views of religious people in America on origins science topics like evolution, the Big Bang, and perceptions of conflicts between science and religion. It found that a large majority of religious people see no conflict between science and religion and only 11% of religious people belong to religions openly rejecting evolution. The fact that the gap between personal and official beliefs of their religions is so large suggests that part of the problem, might be defused by people learning more about their own religious doctrine and the science it endorses, thereby bridging this belief gap. The study concluded that "mainstream religion and mainstream science are neither attacking one another nor perceiving a conflict." Furthermore, they note that this conciliatory view is shared by most leading science organizations such as the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS).&lt;ref name="MIT Science religion origins"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tegmark|first1=Max|last2=Lee|first2=Eugena|title=The MIT Survey on Science, Religion and Origins: the Belief Gap|url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/survey.html|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study collecting data from 2011 to 2014 on the general public, with focus on evangelicals and evangelical scientists was done in collaboration with the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). Even though evangelicals only make up 26% of the US population, the found that nearly 70 percent of all evangelical Christians do not view science and religion as being in conflict with each other (48% saw them as complementary and 21% saw them as independent) while 73% of the general US population saw no conflict as well.&lt;ref name="Ecklund AAAS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ecklund|first1=Elaine|title=Religious Communities, Science, Scientists, and Perceptions: A Comprehensive Survey|url=http://elainehowardecklund.blogs.rice.edu/files/2014/02/RU_AAASPresentationNotes_2014_0220.pdf|website=Elaine Ecklund Blog|publisher=Rice University|date=February 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McCaig AAAS Study"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCaig|first1=Amy|title=Nearly 70 percent of evengelicals do not view religion and science as being in conflict|url=http://news.rice.edu/2015/03/13/nearly-70-percent-of-evangelicals-do-not-view-religion-and-science-as-being-in-conflict/|website=Unconventional Wisdom|publisher=Rice University|date=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other lines of research on perceptions of science among the American public conclude that most religious groups see no general epistemological conflict with science and they have no differences with nonreligious groups in the propensity of seeking out scientific knowledge, although there may be subtle epistemic or moral conflicts when scientists make counterclaims to religious tenets.&lt;ref name="epistemic moral conflict"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=John|title=Epistemological and Moral Conflict Between Religion and Science|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|year=2011|volume=50|issue=4|pages=707–27|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01603.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Joseph O.|journal=Public Understanding of Science|title=Public Perceptions of Incompatibility Between "Science and Religion"|year=2012|volume=21|issue=3|pages=340–53|doi=10.1177/0963662511434908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings from the Pew Center note similar findings and also note that the majority of Americans (80–90%) show strong support for scientific research, agree that science makes society and individual's lives better, and 8 in 10 Americans would be happy if their children were to become scientists.&lt;ref name="Pew Public Understanding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Belief and Public Attitudes About Science in the US|url=http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|publisher=Pew Research Center|author1=Scott Keeter|author2=Gregory Smith|author3=David Masci|pages=1–2, 13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619225841/http://pewresearch.org/assets/pdf/667.pdf|archivedate=2012-06-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even strict creationists tend to have very favorable views on science.&lt;ref name="global public science" /&gt;

According to a 2007 poll by the [[Pew Forum]], "while large majorities of Americans respect science and scientists, they are not always willing to accept scientific findings that squarely contradict their religious beliefs."&lt;ref name=pew2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=275|title=Science in America: Religious Belief and Public Attitudes|publisher=The Pew Forum|date=18 December 2007|accessdate=16 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pew Forum states that specific factual disagreements are "not common today", though 40% to 50% of Americans do not accept the evolution of humans and other living things, with the "strongest opposition" coming from evangelical Christians at 65% saying life did not evolve.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; 51% of the population believes humans and other living things evolved: 26% through natural selection only, 21% somehow guided, 4% don't know.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; In the U.S., biological evolution is the only concrete example of conflict where a significant portion of the American public denies scientific consensus for religious reasons.&lt;ref name="global public science" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt; In terms of advanced industrialized nations, the United States is the most religious.&lt;ref name=pew2007 /&gt;

A 2009 study from the Pew Research Center on Americans perceptions of science, showed a broad consensus that most Americans, including most religious Americans, hold scientific research and scientists themselves in high regard. The study showed that 84% of Americans say they view science as having a mostly positive impact on society. Among those who attend religious services at least once a week, the number is roughly the same at 80%. Furthermore, 70% of U.S. adults think scientists contribute "a lot" to society.&lt;ref name="pew 2009 bulletin"&gt;{{cite web|title=Public Opinion on Religion and Science in the United States|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/public-opinion-on-religion-and-science-in-the-united-states/|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 study on a national sample of US college students examined whether these students viewed the science / religion relationship as reflecting primarily conflict, collaboration, or independence. The study concluded that the majority of undergraduates in both the natural and social sciences do not see conflict between science and religion. Another finding in the study was that it is more likely for students to move away from a conflict perspective to an independence or collaboration perspective than towards a conflict view.&lt;ref name=scheitle11&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;!-- Brief summary of article; talks about sets as collections of distinct objects, mentions that they have many uses in mathematics and that mathematics can be coded in set theory, and that enough of set theory can be axiomatized to do most of mathematics. Remains neutral on whether the subject is defined by its axioms or by its intended interpretation. If the antinomies are mentioned, should not assert that axiomatization is the solution, but should mention that some consider them to have been solved by axiomatization, others by the cumulative hierarchy.

[[Image:Venn A intersect B.svg|thumb|right|A [[Venn diagram]] illustrating the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of two [[set (mathematics)|sets]].]]
'''Set theory''' is a branch of [[mathematical logic]] that studies [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], which informally are collections of objects. Although any type of object can be collected into a set, set theory is applied most often to objects that are relevant to mathematics. The language of set theory can be used to define nearly all [[mathematical object]]s.

The modern study of set theory was initiated by [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Richard Dedekind]] in the 1870s. After the discovery of [[Paradoxes of set theory|paradoxes]] in [[naive set theory]], such as [[Russell's paradox]], numerous [[Axiomatic system|axiom systems]] were proposed in the early [[twentieth century]], of which the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]], with or without the [[axiom of choice]], are the best-known.

Set theory is commonly employed as a [[Foundations of mathematics|foundational system for mathematics]], particularly in the form of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice. Beyond its foundational role, set theory is a branch of [[mathematics]] in its own right, with an active research community. Contemporary research into set theory includes a diverse collection of topics, ranging from the structure of the [[real number]] line to the study of the [[consistency]] of [[large cardinal]]s.

==History==
[[File:Georg Cantor 1894.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Georg Cantor]].]]
Mathematical topics typically emerge and evolve through interactions among many researchers. Set theory, however, was founded by a single paper in 1874 by [[Georg Cantor]]: "[[On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers]]".&lt;ref name="cantor1874"&gt;{{citation |first=Georg |last=Cantor|author-link=Georg Cantor |title=Ueber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen |journal=[[Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik|J. Reine Angew. Math.]] |volume=77 |year=1874 |issue= |pages=258–262 |url = http://www.digizeitschriften.de/main/dms/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002155583 |doi=10.1515/crll.1874.77.258 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Philip |last=Johnson |year=1972 |title=A History of Set Theory |publisher=Prindle, Weber &amp; Schmidt |isbn=0-87150-154-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 5th century BC, beginning with [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Zeno of Elea]] in the West and early [[Indian mathematics|Indian mathematicians]] in the East, mathematicians had struggled with the concept of [[infinity]]. Especially notable is the work of [[Bernard Bolzano]] in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bolzano|first=Bernard|author-link=Bernard Bolzano|editor-last=Berg|editor-first=Jan|title=Einleitung zur Größenlehre und erste Begriffe der allgemeinen Größenlehre|page=152|series=Bernard-Bolzano-Gesamtausgabe, edited by Eduard Winter et al.|volume=Vol. II, A, 7|publisher=Friedrich Frommann Verlag|location=Stuttgart, Bad Cannstatt|isbn=3-7728-0466-7|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern understanding of infinity began in 1870–1874 and was motivated by Cantor's work in [[real analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Dauben|first=Joseph|author-link=Joseph Dauben|title=Georg Cantor: His Mathematics and Philosophy of the Infinite|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1979|isbn=0-674-34871-0|pp=30-54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An 1872 meeting between Cantor and [[Richard Dedekind]] influenced Cantor's thinking and culminated in Cantor's 1874 paper.

Cantor's work initially polarized the mathematicians of his day. While [[Karl Weierstrass]] and Dedekind supported Cantor, [[Leopold Kronecker]], now seen as a founder of [[mathematical constructivism]], did not. Cantorian set theory eventually became widespread, due to the utility of Cantorian concepts, such as [[one-to-one correspondence]] among sets, his proof that there are more [[real number]]s than integers, and the "infinity of infinities" ("[[Cantor's paradise]]") resulting from the [[power set]] operation. This utility of set theory led to the article "Mengenlehre" contributed in 1898 by [[Arthur Schoenflies]] to [[Klein's encyclopedia]].

The next wave of excitement in set theory came around 1900, when it was discovered that some interpretations of Cantorian set theory gave rise to several contradictions, called [[Antinomy|antinomies]] or [[Logical paradox|paradoxes]]. [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Ernst Zermelo]] independently found the simplest and best known paradox, now called [[Russell's paradox]]: consider "the set of all sets that are not members of themselves", which leads to a contradiction since it must be a member of itself and not a member of itself. In 1899 Cantor had himself posed the question "What is the [[cardinal number]] of the set of all sets?", and obtained a related paradox. Russell used his paradox as a theme in his 1903 review of continental mathematics in his ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]''.

In 1906 English readers gained the book ''Theory of Sets of Points''&lt;ref&gt;[[William Henry Young]] &amp; [[Grace Chisholm Young]] (1906) [https://archive.org/stream/theoryofsetsofpo00youniala#page/n3/mode/2up ''Theory of Sets of Points''], link from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; by husband and wife [[William Henry Young]] and [[Grace Chisholm Young]], published by [[Cambridge University Press]].

The momentum of set theory was such that debate on the paradoxes did not lead to its abandonment. The work of [[Zermelo]] in 1908 and the work of [[Abraham Fraenkel]] and [[Thoralf Skolem]] in 1922 resulted in the set of axioms [[ZFC]], which became the most commonly used set of axioms for set theory. The work of [[real analysis|analysts]] such as [[Henri Lebesgue]] demonstrated the great mathematical utility of set theory, which has since become woven into the fabric of modern mathematics. Set theory is commonly used as a foundational system, although in some areas—such as algebraic geometry and algebraic topology—[[category theory]] is thought to be a preferred foundation.

==Basic concepts and notation==
{{Main|Set (mathematics)|Algebra of sets}}

Set theory begins with a fundamental [[binary relation]] between an object {{math|''o''}} and a set {{math|''A''}}. If {{math|''o''}} is a '''[[set membership|member]]''' (or '''element''') of {{math|''A''}}, the notation {{math|''o'' ∈ ''A''}} is used. Since sets are objects, the membership relation can relate sets as well.

A derived [[binary relation]] between two sets is the subset relation, also called '''set inclusion'''. If all the members of set {{math|''A''}} are also members of set {{math|''B''}}, then {{math|''A''}} is a '''[[subset]]''' of {{math|''B''}}, denoted {{math|''A'' ⊆ ''B''}}. For example, {{math|{1, 2} }} is a subset of {{math|{1, 2, 3} }}, and so is {{math|{2} }} but {{math|{1, 4} }} is not. As insinuated from this definition, a set is a subset of itself. For cases where this possibility is unsuitable or would make sense to be rejected, the term '''[[proper subset]]''' is defined. {{math|''A''}} is called a '''proper subset''' of {{math|''B''}} if and only if {{math|''A''}} is a subset of {{math|''B''}}, but {{math|''A''}} is not equal to {{math|''B''}}. Note also that 1, 2, and 3 are members (elements) of the set {{math|{1, 2, 3} }} but are not subsets of it; and in turn, the subsets, such as {1}, are not members of the set {1, 2, 3}.

Just as [[arithmetic]] features [[binary operation]]s on [[number]]s, set theory features binary operations on sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1527264|title=Introductory real analysis|last=Kolmogorov|first=A.N.|date=1970|publisher=Dover Publications|others=Fomin, S. V.|year=1970|isbn=0486612260|edition=Rev. English ed|location=New York|pages=2-3|oclc=1527264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The:
*'''[[union (set theory)|Union]]''' of the sets {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, denoted {{math|''A'' ∪ ''B''}}, is the set of all objects that are a member of {{math|''A''}}, or {{math|''B''}}, or both. The union of {{math|{1, 2, 3} }} and {{math|{2, 3, 4} }} is the set {{math|{1, 2, 3, 4} }}.
*'''[[intersection (set theory)|Intersection]]''' of the sets {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, denoted {{math|''A'' ∩ ''B''}}, is the set of all objects that are members of both {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}. The intersection of {{math|{1, 2, 3} }} and {{math|{2, 3, 4} }} is the set {{math|{2, 3} }}.
*'''[[Set difference]]''' of {{math|''U''}} and {{math|''A''}}, denoted {{math|''U'' \ ''A''}}, is the set of all members of {{math|''U''}} that are not members of {{math|''A''}}. The set difference {{math|{1, 2, 3} \ {2, 3, 4} }} is {{math|{1} }}, while, conversely, the set difference {{math|{2, 3, 4} \ {1, 2, 3} }} is {{math|{4} }}. When {{math|''A''}} is a subset of {{math|''U''}}, the set difference {{math|''U'' \ ''A''}} is also called the '''[[complement (set theory)|complement]]''' of {{math|''A''}} in {{math|''U''}}. In this case, if the choice of {{math|''U''}} is clear from the context, the notation {{math|''A''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is sometimes used instead of {{math|''U'' \ ''A''}}, particularly if {{math|''U''}} is a [[universal set]] as in the study of [[Venn diagram]]s.
*'''[[Symmetric difference]]''' of sets {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, denoted {{math|''A'' △ ''B''}} or {{math|''A'' ⊖ ''B''}}, is the set of all objects that are a member of exactly one of {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} (elements which are in one of the sets, but not in both). For instance, for the sets {{math|{1, 2, 3} }} and {{math|{2, 3, 4} }}, the symmetric difference set is {{math|{1, 4} }}. It is the set difference of the union and the intersection, {{math|(''A'' ∪ ''B'') \ (''A'' ∩ ''B'')}} or {{math|(''A'' \ ''B'') ∪ (''B'' \ ''A'')}}.
*'''[[Cartesian product]]''' of {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}, denoted {{math|''A'' × ''B''}}, is the set whose members are all possible [[ordered pair]]s {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} where {{math|''a''}} is a member of {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''b''}} is a member of {{math|''B''}}. The cartesian product of {{nowrap|1={1, 2} and {red, white} is {(1, red), (1, white), (2, red), (2, white)}.}}
*'''[[Power set]]''' of a set {{math|''A''}} is the set whose members are all of the possible subsets of {{math|''A''}}. For example, the power set of {{math|{1, 2} }} is {{math|{ {}, {1}, {2}, {1, 2} } }}.

Some basic sets of central importance are the [[empty set]] (the unique set containing no elements; occasionally called the ''null set'' though this name is ambiguous), the set of [[natural number]]s, and the set of [[real number]]s.

==Some ontology==
{{Main|von Neumann universe}}
[[Image:Von Neumann Hierarchy.svg|thumb|right|300px|An initial segment of the von Neumann hierarchy.]]

A set is [[pure set|pure]] if all of its members are sets, all members of its members are sets, and so on. For example, the set {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} containing only the empty set is a nonempty pure set. In modern set theory, it is common to restrict attention to the '''[[von Neumann universe]]''' of pure sets, and many systems of axiomatic set theory are designed to axiomatize the pure sets only. There are many technical advantages to this restriction, and little generality is lost, because essentially all mathematical concepts can be modeled by pure sets. Sets in the von Neumann universe are organized into a [[cumulative hierarchy]], based on how deeply their members, members of members, etc. are nested. Each set in this hierarchy is assigned (by [[transfinite recursion]]) an [[ordinal number]] α, known as its '''rank'''. The rank of a pure set X is defined to be the [[least upper bound]] of all [[Successor ordinal|successors]] of ranks of members of X. For example, the empty set is assigned rank 0, while the set {{math| &lt;nowiki&gt;{{}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; }} containing only the empty set is assigned rank 1. For each ordinal α, the set ''V''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to consist of all pure sets with rank less than α. The entire von Neumann universe is denoted&amp;nbsp;''V''.

==Axiomatic set theory==
Elementary set theory can be studied informally and intuitively, and so can be taught in primary schools using [[Venn diagram]]s. The intuitive approach tacitly assumes that a set may be formed from the class of all objects satisfying any particular defining condition. This assumption gives rise to paradoxes, the simplest and best known of which are [[Russell's paradox]] and the [[Burali-Forti paradox]]. Axiomatic set theory was originally devised to rid set theory of such paradoxes.&lt;ref&gt;In his 1925, [[John von Neumann]] observed that "set theory in its first, "naive" version, due to Cantor, led to contradictions. These are the well-known [[antinomy|antinomies]] of the set of all sets that do not contain themselves (Russell), of the set of all transfinte ordinal numbers (Burali-Forti), and the set of all finitely definable real numbers (Richard)." He goes on to observe that two "tendencies" were attempting to "rehabilitate" set theory. Of the first effort, exemplified by [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Julius König]], [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], von Neumann called the "overall effect of their activity . . . devastating". With regards to the axiomatic method employed by second group composed of [[Zermelo]], [[Abraham Fraenkel]] and [[Arthur Moritz Schoenflies]], von Neumann worried that "We see only that the known modes of inference leading to the antinomies fail, but who knows where there are not others?" and he set to the task, "in the spirit of the second group", to "produce, by means of a finite number of purely formal operations . . . all the sets that we want to see formed" but not allow for the antinomies. (All quotes from von Neumann 1925 reprinted in van Heijenoort, Jean (1967, third printing 1976), ''From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879–1931'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge MA, {{isbn|0-674-32449-8}} (pbk). A synopsis of the history, written by van Heijenoort, can be found in the comments that precede von Neumann's 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widely studied systems of axiomatic set theory imply that all sets form a [[cumulative hierarchy]]. Such systems come in two flavors, those whose [[ontology]] consists of:
*''Sets alone''. This includes the most common axiomatic set theory, '''[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC)''', which includes the [[axiom of choice]]. Fragments of ZFC include:
** [[Zermelo set theory]], which replaces the [[axiom schema of replacement]] with that of [[axiom schema of separation|separation]];
** [[General set theory]], a small fragment of [[Zermelo set theory]] sufficient for the [[Peano axioms]] and [[finite set]]s;
** [[Kripke–Platek set theory]], which omits the axioms of infinity, [[axiom of power set|powerset]], and [[axiom of choice|choice]], and weakens the axiom schemata of [[axiom schema of separation|separation]] and [[axiom schema of replacement|replacement]].
*''Sets and [[proper class]]es''. These include [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]], which has the same strength as [[ZFC]] for theorems about sets alone, and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] and [[Tarski–Grothendieck set theory]], both of which are stronger than ZFC.
The above systems can be modified to allow '''[[urelement]]s''', objects that can be members of sets but that are not themselves sets and do not have any members.

The systems of '''[[New Foundations]] NFU''' (allowing [[urelement]]s) and '''NF''' (lacking them) are not based on a cumulative hierarchy. NF and NFU include a "set of everything, " relative to which every set has a complement. In these systems urelements matter, because NF, but not NFU, produces sets for which the [[axiom of choice]] does not hold.

Systems of [[constructive set theory]], such as CST, CZF, and IZF, embed their set axioms in [[intuitionistic logic|intuitionistic]] instead of [[classical logic]]. Yet other systems accept classical logic but feature a nonstandard membership relation. These include [[Rough set|rough set theory]] and [[fuzzy set theory]], in which the value of an [[atomic formula]] embodying the membership relation is not simply '''True''' or '''False'''. The [[Boolean-valued model]]s of [[ZFC]] are a related subject.

An enrichment of [[ZFC]] called [[internal set theory]] was proposed by [[Edward Nelson]] in 1977.

==Applications==
Many mathematical concepts can be defined precisely using only set theoretic concepts. For example, mathematical structures as diverse as [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, [[manifolds]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], and [[vector space]]s can all be defined as sets satisfying various (axiomatic) properties. [[equivalence relation|Equivalence]] and [[order relation]]s are ubiquitous in mathematics, and the theory of mathematical [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] can be described in set theory.

Set theory is also a promising foundational system for much of mathematics. Since the publication of the first volume of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', it has been claimed that most or even all mathematical theorems can be derived using an aptly designed set of axioms for set theory, augmented with many definitions, using [[first order logic|first]] or [[second order logic]]. For example, properties of the [[natural number|natural]] and [[real number]]s can be derived within set theory, as each number system can be identified with a set of [[equivalence class]]es under a suitable [[equivalence relation]] whose field is some [[infinite set]].

Set theory as a foundation for [[mathematical analysis]], [[topology]], [[abstract algebra]], and [[discrete mathematics]] is likewise uncontroversial; mathematicians accept that (in principle) theorems in these areas can be derived from the relevant definitions and the axioms of set theory. Few full derivations of complex mathematical theorems from set theory have been formally verified, however, because such formal derivations are often much longer than the natural language proofs mathematicians commonly present. One verification project, [[Metamath]], includes human-written, computer‐verified derivations of more than 12,000 theorems starting from [[ZFC]] set theory, [[first order logic]] and [[propositional logic]].

==Areas of study==
Set theory is a major area of research in mathematics, with many interrelated subfields.

===Combinatorial set theory===
{{Main|Infinitary combinatorics}}

'''Combinatorial set theory''' concerns extensions of finite [[combinatorics]] to infinite sets. This includes the study of [[cardinal arithmetic]] and the study of extensions of [[Ramsey's theorem]] such as the [[Erdős–Rado theorem]].

===Descriptive set theory===
{{Main|Descriptive set theory}}

'''Descriptive set theory''' is the study of subsets of the [[real line]] and, more generally, subsets of [[Polish space]]s. It begins with the study of [[pointclass]]es in the [[Borel hierarchy]] and extends to the study of more complex hierarchies such as the [[projective hierarchy]] and the [[Wadge hierarchy]]. Many properties of [[Borel set]]s can be established in ZFC, but proving these properties hold for more complicated sets requires additional axioms related to determinacy and large cardinals.

The field of [[effective descriptive set theory]] is between set theory and [[recursion theory]]. It includes the study of [[lightface pointclass]]es, and is closely related to [[hyperarithmetical theory]]. In many cases, results of classical descriptive set theory have effective versions; in some cases, new results are obtained by proving the effective version first and then extending ("relativizing") it to make it more broadly applicable.

A recent area of research concerns [[Borel equivalence relation]]s and more complicated definable [[equivalence relation]]s. This has important applications to the study of [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]] in many fields of mathematics.

===Fuzzy set theory===
{{Main|Fuzzy set theory}}

In set theory as [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] defined and [[Zermelo]] and [[Fraenkel]] axiomatized, an object is either a member of a set or not. In [[fuzzy set theory]] this condition was relaxed by [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]] so an object has a ''degree of membership'' in a set, a number between 0 and 1. For example, the degree of membership of a person in the set of "tall people" is more flexible than a simple yes or no answer and can be a real number such as 0.75.

===Inner model theory===
{{Main|Inner model theory}}

An '''inner model''' of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZF) is a transitive [[proper class|class]] that includes all the ordinals and satisfies all the axioms of ZF. The canonical example is the [[constructible universe]] ''L'' developed by Gödel.
One reason that the study of inner models is of interest is that it can be used to prove consistency results. For example, it can be shown that regardless of whether a model ''V'' of ZF satisfies the [[continuum hypothesis]] or the [[axiom of choice]], the inner model ''L'' constructed inside the original model will satisfy both the generalized continuum hypothesis and the axiom of choice. Thus the assumption that ZF is consistent (has at least one model) implies that ZF together with these two principles is consistent.

The study of inner models is common in the study of [[axiom of determinacy|determinacy]] and [[large cardinal]]s, especially when considering axioms such as the axiom of determinacy that contradict the axiom of choice. Even if a fixed model of set theory satisfies the axiom of choice, it is possible for an inner model to fail to satisfy the axiom of choice. For example, the existence of sufficiently large cardinals implies that there is an inner model satisfying the axiom of determinacy (and thus not satisfying the axiom of choice).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Jech | first1=Thomas | author1-link=Thomas Jech | title=Set Theory | edition=Third Millennium | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-44085-7 | year=2003 | zbl=1007.03002 | page=642 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large cardinals===
{{Main|Large cardinal property}}

A '''large cardinal''' is a cardinal number with an extra property. Many such properties are studied, including [[inaccessible cardinal]]s, [[measurable cardinal]]s, and many more. These properties typically imply the cardinal number must be very large, with the existence of a cardinal with the specified property unprovable in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.

===Determinacy===
{{Main|Determinacy}}

'''Determinacy''' refers to the fact that, under appropriate assumptions, certain two-player games of perfect information are determined from the start in the sense that one player must have a winning strategy. The existence of these strategies has important consequences in descriptive set theory, as the assumption that a broader class of games is determined often implies that a broader class of sets will have a topological property. The [[axiom of determinacy]] (AD) is an important object of study; although incompatible with the axiom of choice, AD implies that all subsets of the real line are well behaved (in particular, measurable and with the perfect set property). AD can be used to prove that the [[Wadge degree]]s have an elegant structure.

===Forcing===
{{Main|Forcing (mathematics)}}

[[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] invented the method of [[forcing (mathematics)|forcing]] while searching for a [[model theory|model]] of [[ZFC]] in which the [[continuum hypothesis]] fails, or a model of ZF in which the [[axiom of choice]] fails. Forcing adjoins to some given model of set theory additional sets in order to create a larger model with properties determined (i.e. "forced") by the construction and the original model. For example, Cohen's construction adjoins additional subsets of the [[natural number]]s without changing any of the [[cardinal number]]s of the original model. Forcing is also one of two methods for proving [[consistency (mathematical logic)|relative consistency]] by finitistic methods, the other method being [[Boolean-valued model]]s.

===Cardinal invariants===
{{Main|Cardinal invariant}}

A '''cardinal invariant''' is a property of the real line measured by a cardinal number. For example, a well-studied invariant is the smallest cardinality of a collection of [[meagre set]]s of reals whose union is the entire real line. These are invariants in the sense that any two isomorphic models of set theory must give the same cardinal for each invariant. Many cardinal invariants have been studied, and the relationships between them are often complex and related to axioms of set theory.

===Set-theoretic topology===
{{Main|Set-theoretic topology}}

'''Set-theoretic topology''' studies questions of [[general topology]] that are set-theoretic in nature or that require advanced methods of set theory for their solution. Many of these theorems are independent of ZFC, requiring stronger axioms for their proof. A famous problem is the [[Moore space (topology)|normal Moore space question]], a question in general topology that was the subject of intense research. The answer to the normal Moore space question was eventually proved to be independent of ZFC.

==Objections to set theory as a foundation for mathematics==
From set theory's inception, some mathematicians [[controversy over Cantor's theory|have objected to it]] as a [[foundations of mathematics|foundation for mathematics]]. The most common objection to set theory, one [[Leopold Kronecker|Kronecker]] voiced in set theory's earliest years, starts from the [[mathematical constructivism|constructivist]] view that mathematics is loosely related to computation. If this view is granted, then the treatment of infinite sets, both in [[naive set theory|naive]] and in axiomatic set theory, introduces into mathematics methods and objects that are not computable even in principle. The feasibility of constructivism as a substitute foundation for mathematics was greatly increased by [[Errett Bishop]]'s influential book ''Foundations of Constructive Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Errett 1967. ''Foundations of Constructive Analysis'', New York: Academic Press. {{isbn|4-87187-714-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different objection put forth by [[Henri Poincaré]] is that defining sets using the axiom schemas of [[Axiom schema of specification|specification]] and [[Axiom schema of replacement|replacement]], as well as the axiom of [[Axiom of power set|power set]], introduces [[impredicativity]], a type of [[Circular definition|circularity]], into the definitions of mathematical objects. The scope of predicatively founded mathematics, while less than that of the commonly accepted Zermelo-Fraenkel theory, is much greater than that of constructive mathematics, to the point that [[Solomon Feferman]] has said that "all of scientifically applicable analysis can be developed [using predicative methods]".&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Feferman, 1998, In the Light of Logic, Oxford Univ. Press (New York), p.280-283 and 293-294&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] condemned set theory. He wrote that "set theory is wrong", since it builds on the "nonsense" of fictitious symbolism, has "pernicious idioms", and that it is nonsensical to talk about "all numbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |year=1975 |title=Philosophical Remarks, §129, §174 |publisher=Oxford: Basil Blackwell |isbn=0631191305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wittgenstein's views about the foundations of mathematics were later criticised by [[Georg Kreisel]] and [[Paul Bernays]], and investigated by [[Crispin Wright]], among others.

[[category theory|Category theorists]] have proposed [[topos theory]] as an alternative to traditional axiomatic set theory. Topos theory can interpret various alternatives to that theory, such as [[mathematical constructivism|constructivism]], finite set theory, and [[Turing Machine|computable]] set theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Ferro |first=A. |last2=Omodeo |first2=E.

Springer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;

An active area of research is the [[univalent foundations]] and related to it [[homotopy type theory]]. Within homotopy type theory, a set may be regarded as a homotopy 0-type, with [[universal properties]] of sets arising from the inductive and recursive properties of [[higher inductive type]]s. Principles such as the [[axiom of choice]] and the [[law of the excluded middle]] can be formulated in a manner corresponding to the classical formulation in set theory or perhaps in a spectrum of distinct ways unique to type theory. Some of these principles may be proven to be a consequence of other principles. The variety of formulations of these axiomatic principles allows for a detailed analysis of the formulations required in order to derive various mathematical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{nlab|id=homotopy+type+theory|title=homotopy type theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/ ''Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics''].

{{See|Shear stress}}
'''Shearing forces''' are unaligned [[force]]s pushing one part of a body in one specific direction, and another part of the body in the opposite direction. When the forces are aligned into each other, they are called [[compression forces]]. An example is a deck of cards being pushed one way on the top, and the other at the bottom, causing the cards to slide. Another example is when wind blows at the side of a peaked roof of a home - the side walls experience a force at their top pushing in the direction of the wind, and their bottom in the opposite direction, from the ground or foundation. William A. Nash defines shear force in terms of [[Plane (geometry)|planes]]: "If a plane is passed through a body, a force acting along this plane is called a ''shear force'' or ''shearing force''."&lt;ref name="Nash1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A.

==Shear force of steel and bolts==
Here follows a short example of how to work out the shear force of a piece of steel. The factor of 0.6 used to change from [[tensile force|tensile]] to shear force could vary from 0.58–0.62 and will depend on application.

Steel called EN8 bright has a tensile strength of 800{{nbsp}}MPa and mild steel has a tensile strength of 400{{nbsp}}MPa.

To work out the force to shear a 25&amp;nbsp;mm diameter round steel EN8 bright;
: Area of the 25{{nbsp}}mm round steel in mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (12.5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(π) ≈ 490.8{{nbsp}}mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: 0.8{{nbsp}}kN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 490.8{{nbsp}}mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 392.64{{nbsp}}kN ≈ 40{{nbsp}}tonne-force
: 40{{nbsp}}tonne-force × 0.6 (to change force from tensile to shear) = 24{{nbsp}}tonne-force

When working with a [[rivet]]ed or tensioned [[bolted joint]], the strength comes from friction between the materials bolted together. Bolts are correctly torqued to maintain the friction. The shear force only becomes relevant when the bolts are not torqued.

A bolt with property class 12.9 has a tensile strength of 1200{{nbsp}}MPa (1{{nbsp}}MPa = 1{{nbsp}}N/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or 1.2{{nbsp}}kN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the yield strength is 0.90 times tensile strength, 1080{{nbsp}}MPa in this case.

A bolt with property class 4.6 has a tensile strength of 400{{nbsp}}MPa (1{{nbsp}}MPa = 1{{nbsp}}N/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or 0.4&amp;nbsp;kN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and yield strength is 0.60 times tensile strength, 240{{nbsp}}MPa in this case.

In case of fasteners, proof load is specified as it gives a real life picture about the characteristics of the bolt.

'''Surface plasmon resonance''' ('''SPR''') is the resonant oscillation of conduction electrons at the interface between negative and positive permittivity material stimulated by incident light. SPR is the basis of many standard tools for measuring [[adsorption]] of material onto planar metal (typically gold or silver) surfaces or onto the surface of metal [[nanoparticle]]s. It is the fundamental principle behind many color-based [[biosensor]] applications, different [[lab-on-a-chip]] sensors and diatom photosynthesis.

==Explanation==
The [[surface plasmon polariton]] is a non-radiative [[electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic surface wave]] &lt;!--The field energy present in the dielectric medium is evanescent. --&gt; that propagates in a direction parallel to the negative permittivity/dielectric material interface. Since the wave is on the boundary of the conductor and the external medium (air, water or vacuum for example), these oscillations are very sensitive to any change of this boundary, such as the adsorption of molecules to the conducting surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Zeng|title=Nanomaterials enhanced surface plasmon resonance for biological and chemical sensing applications |journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=43 |pages=3426–3452 |date=2014|doi=10.1039/C3CS60479A|last2= Baillargeat|first2= Dominique|last3=Ho|first3=Ho-Pui|last4=Yong|first4=Ken-Tye |pmid=24549396 |issue=10 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260252810|bibcode=2012ChSRv..41.6507P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To describe the existence and properties of surface plasmon polaritons, one can choose from various models (quantum theory, [[Drude model]], etc.). The simplest way to approach the problem is to treat each material as a homogeneous continuum, described by a frequency-dependent [[relative static permittivity|relative permittivity]] between the external medium and the surface. This quantity, hereafter referred to as the materials' "[[dielectric function]]", is the [[complex permittivity]]. In order for the terms that describe the electronic [[surface plasmon]] to exist, the real part of the dielectric constant of the conductor must be negative and its magnitude must be greater than that of the dielectric. This condition is met in the infrared-visible wavelength region for air/metal and water/metal interfaces (where the real dielectric constant of a metal is negative and that of air or water is positive).

LSPRs (Localized SPRs) are collective electron charge oscillations in metallic nanoparticles that are excited by light. They exhibit enhanced near-field amplitude at the resonance wavelength. This field is highly localized at the nanoparticle and decays rapidly away from the nanoparticle/dieletric interface into the dielectric background, though far-field scattering by the particle is also enhanced by the resonance. Light intensity enhancement is a very important aspect of LSPRs and localization means the LSPR has very high spatial resolution (subwavelength), limited only by the size of nanoparticles. Because of the enhanced field amplitude, effects that depend on the amplitude such as magneto-optical effect are also enhanced by LSPRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Plasmonic Au/Co/Au nanosandwiches with Enhanced Magneto-Optical Activity|journal=Small |volume=4|date=2008|doi= 10.1002/smll.200700594|pmid=18196506|issue=2|pages=202–5|last1=González-Díaz|first1=Juan B.|last2=García-Martín|first2=Antonio|last3=García-Martín|first3=José M.|last4=Cebollada|first4=Alfonso|last5=Armelles|first5=Gaspar|last6=Sepúlveda|first6=Borja|last7=Alaverdyan|first7=Yury|last8=Käll|first8=Mikael|hdl=10261/17402 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evidence of localized surface plasmon enhanced magneto-optical effect in nanodisk array |journal=Appl.

==Implementations==
[[File:Otto-schema.png|thumb|Otto configuration]]
[[File:SPR-schema.png|thumb|Kretschmann configuration]]

In order to excite surface plasmons in a resonant manner, one can use electron bombardment or incident [[light beam]] (visible and infrared are typical). The incoming beam has to match its [[momentum]] to that of the plasmon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Size dependence of Au NP-enhanced surface plasmon resonance based on differential phase measurement |journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical |date=2013|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.073|volume=176|pages=1128–1133|last1=Zeng|first1=Shuwen|last2=Yu|first2=Xia|last3=Law|first3=Wing-Cheung|last4=Zhang|first4=Yating|last5=Hu|first5=Rui|last6=Dinh|first6=Xuan-Quyen|last7=Ho|first7=Ho-Pui|last8=Yong|first8=Ken-Tye |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268225952 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Polarization (waves)|p-polarized]] light  (polarization occurs parallel to the plane of incidence), this is possible by passing the light through a block of glass to increase the [[wavenumber]] (and the [[momentum]]), and achieve the resonance at a given wavelength and angle. [[Polarization (waves)|S-polarized]] light (polarization occurs perpendicular to the plane of incidence) cannot excite electronic surface plasmons.
Electronic and magnetic surface plasmons obey the following [[dispersion relation]]:

:&lt;math&gt; K(\omega) = \frac{\omega}{c} \sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_2 \mu_1 \mu_2}{\varepsilon_1 \mu_1 + \varepsilon_2 \mu_2}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the relative permittivity, and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the relative permeability of the material (1: the glass block, 2: the metal film), while &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is angular frequency and &lt;math&gt;{c}&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in a vacuum.

Typical metals that support surface plasmons are silver and gold, but metals such as copper, titanium or chromium have also been used.

When using light to excite SP waves, there are two configurations which are well
known. In the Otto setup, the light illuminates the wall of a glass block, typically a prism, and is [[total internal reflection|totally internally reflected]]. A thin metal film (for example gold) is positioned close enough to the prism wall so that an [[evanescent wave]] can interact with the plasma waves on the surface and hence excite the plasmons.

In the '''Kretschmann configuration''', the metal film is evaporated onto the glass
block. The light again illuminates the glass block, and an evanescent wave
penetrates through the metal film. The plasmons are excited at the outer side
of the film.
This configuration is used in most practical applications.

===SPR emission===
When the surface plasmon wave interacts with a local particle or irregularity, such as a [[surface roughness|rough surface]], part of the energy can be re-emitted as light. This emitted light can be detected ''behind'' the metal film from various directions.

==Applications==
[[File:Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Operations A.jpg|400px|Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Operations A]][[File:Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Operations B.jpg|400px|Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Operations B]]

Surface plasmons have been used to enhance the surface sensitivity of several spectroscopic measurements including [[fluorescence]], [[Raman scattering]], and [[second harmonic generation]]. However, in their simplest form, SPR reflectivity measurements can be used to detect molecular adsorption, such as polymers, DNA or proteins, etc. Technically, it is common to measure the angle of minimum reflection (angle of maximum absorption). This angle changes in the order of 0.1° during thin (about nm thickness) film adsorption. (See also the Examples.) In other cases the changes in the absorption wavelength is followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A localized surface plasmon resonance based immunosensor for the detection of casein in milk|journal=Sci. Technol. Adv. Mater.|volume=8|date=2007|pages= 331–338|doi=10.1016/j.stam.2006.12.010|bibcode = 2007STAdM...8..331M|issue=4|last1=Minh Hiep|first1=Ha|last2=Endo|first2=Tatsuro|last3=Kerman|first3=Kagan|last4=Chikae|first4=Miyuki|last5=Kim|first5=Do-Kyun|last6=Yamamura|first6=Shohei|last7=Takamura|first7=Yuzuru|last8=Tamiya|first8=Eiichi }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of detection is based on that the adsorbing molecules cause changes in the local index of refraction, changing the resonance conditions of the surface plasmon waves. The same principle is exploited in the recently developed competitive platform based on loss-less dielectric multilayers ([[Distributed_Bragg_reflector|DBR]]), supporting surface electromagnetic waves with sharper resonances ([[Bloch surface waves]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical|volume=174|pages=292–298|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.snb.2012.07.015|title=Direct comparison of the performance of Bloch surface wave and surface plasmon polariton sensors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925400512006958|last1=Sinibaldi|first1=A.|last2=Danz|first2=N.|last3=Descrovi|first3=E.|display-authors = etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the surface is patterned with different biopolymers, using adequate optics and imaging sensors (i.e. a camera), the technique can be extended to [[surface plasmon resonance microscopy|surface plasmon resonance imaging]] (SPRI). This method provides a high contrast of the images based on the adsorbed amount of molecules, somewhat similar to [[Brewster's angle|Brewster angle]] microscopy (this latter is most commonly used together with a [[Langmuir–Blodgett trough]]).

For nanoparticles, localized surface plasmon oscillations can give rise to the intense colors of [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] or [[sol (colloid)|sols]] containing the [[nanoparticle]]s. Nanoparticles or nanowires of noble metals exhibit strong [[absorption band]]s in the [[ultraviolet]]-[[visible light|visible]] light regime that are not present in the bulk metal. This extraordinary absorption increase has been exploited to increase light absorption in photovoltaic cells by depositing metal nanoparticles on the cell surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J.

=== SPR Immunoassay ===
The first SPR [[immunoassay]] was proposed in 1983 by Liedberg, Nylander, and Lundström, then of the [[Linköping Institute of Technology]] (Sweden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0250-6874(83)85036-7|title=Surface plasmon resonance for gas detection and biosensing|date=1983|last1=Liedberg|first1=Bo|last2=Nylander|first2=Claes|last3=Lunström|first3=Ingemar|journal=Sensors and Actuators|volume=4|pages=299–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They adsorbed
human [[Immunoglobulin G|IgG]] onto a 600-angstrom silver film, and used the assay to detect anti-human IgG in water solution.  Unlike many other immunoassays, such as [[ELISA]], an SPR immunoassay is ''label free'' in that a [[Fluorescent labelling|label molecule]] is not required for detection of the analyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17145039|date=2007|last1=Rich|first1=RL|last2=Myszka|first2=DG|title=Higher-throughput, label-free, real-time molecular interaction analysis|volume=361|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2006.10.040|journal=Analytical Biochemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the measurements on SPR can be followed real-time allowing the monitoring of individual steps in sequential binding events particularly useful in the assessment of for instance sandwich complexes.

===Material characterization===
[[Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance]], a special configuration of SPR, can be used to characterize layers and stacks of layers. Besides binding kinetics, MP-SPR can also provide information on structural changes in terms of layer true thickness and refractive index. MP-SPR has been applied successfully in measurements of lipid targeting and rupture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Granqvist|first1=Niko|last2=Yliperttula|first2=Marjo|last3=Välimäki|first3=Salla|last4=Pulkkinen|first4=Petri|last5=Tenhu|first5=Heikki|last6=Viitala|first6=Tapani|title=Control of the Morphology of Lipid Layers by Substrate Surface Chemistry|journal=Langmuir|date=18 March 2014|volume=30|issue=10|pages=2799–2809|doi=10.1021/la4046622|pmid=24564782}}&lt;/ref&gt; CVD-deposited single monolayer of graphene (3.7Å)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jussila|first1=Henri|last2=Yang|first2=He|last3=Granqvist|first3=Niko|last4=Sun|first4=Zhipei|title=Surface plasmon resonance for characterization of large-area atomic-layer graphene film|journal=Optica|date=5 February 2016|volume=3|issue=2|pages=151|doi=10.1364/OPTICA.3.000151}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as micrometer thick polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korhonen|first1=Kristiina|last2=Granqvist|first2=Niko|last3=Ketolainen|first3=Jarkko|last4=Laitinen|first4=Riikka|title=Monitoring of drug release kinetics from thin polymer films by multi-parametric surface plasmon resonance|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutics|date=October 2015|volume=494|issue=1|pages=531–536|doi=10.1016/j.ijpharm.2015.08.071|pmid=26319634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data interpretation===
The most common data interpretation is based on the [[Fresnel equations|Fresnel formulas]], which treat the formed thin films as infinite, continuous dielectric layers. This interpretation may result in multiple possible [[refractive index]] and thickness values. However, usually only one solution is within the reasonable data range. In [[Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance]], two SPR curves are acquired by scanning a range of angles at two different wavelengths, which results in a unique solution for both thickness and refractive index.

Metal particle plasmons are usually modeled using the [[Mie theory|Mie scattering theory]].

In many cases no detailed models are applied, but the sensors are calibrated for the specific application, and used with [[interpolation]] within the calibration curve.

==Examples==

===Layer-by-layer self-assembly===
[[File:SPR-adsorption-data.png|thumb|SPR curves measured during the adsorption of a [[polyelectrolyte]] and then a [[clay]] mineral [[self-assembly|self-assembled]] film onto a thin (ca. 38 nanometers) gold sensor.]]

One of the first common applications of surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy was the measurement of the thickness (and refractive index) of adsorbed self-assembled nanofilms on gold substrates. The resonance curves shift to higher angles as the thickness of the adsorbed film increases. This example is a 'static SPR' measurement.

When higher speed observation is desired, one can select an angle right below
the resonance point (the angle of minimum reflectance), and measure the reflectivity changes at that point.
This is the so-called 'dynamic SPR' measurement. The interpretation of the data assumes that the structure of the film does not change significantly during the measurement.

===Binding constant determination===
[[File:SPR-curve.png|thumb|Association and dissociation signal]]
[[File:Biacore diagram.jpg|thumb|Example of output from [[Biacore]]]]
When the affinity of two [[ligand]]s has to be determined, the [[binding constant]] must be determined. It is the equilibrium value for the product quotient. This value can also be found using the dynamic SPR parameters and, as in any chemical reaction, it is the dissociation rate divided by the association rate.

For this, a bait ligand is immobilized on the dextran surface of the SPR crystal. Through a [[microfluidics|microflow]] system, a solution with the prey analyte is injected over the bait layer. As the prey analyte binds the bait ligand, an increase in SPR signal (expressed in response units, RU) is observed. After desired association time, a solution without the prey analyte (usually the buffer) is injected on the microfluidics that dissociates the bound complex between bait ligand and prey analyte. Now as the prey analyte dissociates from the bait ligand, a decrease in SPR signal (expressed in resonance units, RU) is observed. From these association ('on rate', {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}) and dissociation rates ('off rate', {{math|''k''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;}}), the equilibrium dissociation constant ('binding constant', {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;}}) can be calculated.

The actual SPR signal can be explained by the electromagnetic 'coupling' of the incident light with the surface plasmon of the gold layer. This plasmon can be influenced by the layer just a few nanometer across the gold–solution interface i.e. the bait protein and possibly the prey protein. Binding makes the reflection angle change;

&lt;math&gt;K_D = \frac{k_{\text{d}}}{k_{\text{a}}}&lt;/math&gt;

===Thermodynamic analysis===
As SPR biosensors facilitate measurements at different temperatures, thermodynamic analysis can be performed
to obtain a better understanding of the studied interaction. By performing measurements at different temperatures,
typically between 4 and 40 °C, it is possible to relate association and dissociation rate constants with activation
energy and thereby obtain thermodynamic parameters including binding enthalpy, binding entropy,
Gibbs free energy and heat capacity.

===Pair-wise epitope mapping===
As SPR allows real-time monitoring, individual steps in sequential binding events can be thoroughly assessed when investigating the suitability between antibodies in a sandwich configuration. Additionally, it allows the mapping of epitopes as antibodies of overlapping epitopes will be associated with an attenuated signal compared to those capable of interacting simultaneously.

==Magnetic plasmon resonance==
Recently, there has been an interest in magnetic surface plasmons. These require materials with large negative magnetic permeability, a property that has only recently been made available with the construction of [[metamaterial]]s.

'''The Loft Literary Center''' is a nonprofit literary organization located in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] incorporated in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: About the Loft |url=https://www.loft.org/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Loft is one of the nation’s largest and most comprehensive independent literary centers, and offers a variety of writing classes, conferences, grants, readings, writers' studios and other services to both established and emerging writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The New York Times: With Books as a Catalyst, Minneapolis Neighborhood Revives |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/realestate/commercial/30books.html?_r=3&amp;oref=slogin&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Resources |url=https://www.loft.org/resources/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year the Loft hosts more than 400 writers and performers that draw more than 12,000 people, and collaborates with at least 30 local and national organizations. The Loft additionally claims to have more than 170,000 unique visitors through digital resources and online writing classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Annual Report |url=https://www.loft.org/about/annual_report/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Inception===

Incorporated in 1975, the Loft started in a bookstore when a group of writers decided to offer classes and readings in the upstairs loft. Following a series of successful events held at Rusoff &amp; Co. Book Dealers in [[Dinkytown]], Minnesota, bookstore owner Marly Rusoff and writers Jim Moore, [[Patricia Hampl]], Phebe Hanson, and Michael Dennis Browne formed a ‘poets’ club’ with support from a fundraising party emceed by [[Garrison Keillor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Altered Scale: Rebecca Weaver on The Loft in the 70s |url=http://alteredscale.com/contentsandnavigation/rebecca-weaver-on-the-loft/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘poets’ club’ eventually became known as ‘The Loft,’ and in 1975 filed for nonprofit status and received a grant from the Minnesota State Arts Board to sponsor several writing workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Pioneer Press: Marly Rusoff: St. Paul native, Loft 'mother,' literary agent and now publisher |url=http://www.twincities.com/entertainment/ci_23974915/loft-mother-and-literary-agent-rusoff-is-now}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next two years, the Loft hosted a number of benefit readings that featured poets such as [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Robert Bly]], and [[Etheridge Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Minnesota Historical Society: Loft Literary Center |url=http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00213.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued growth===

Over the years, the Loft grew organically as a community-based nonprofit to become one of the nation’s leading independent literary centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Minnesota Women's Press: A Home for Writers |url=http://www.womenspress.com/print.asp?ArticleID=2327&amp;SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With support from the Jerome Foundation the Loft launched the Mentor Series in 1980, bringing together nationally prominent authors with promising local writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Jerome Foundation: The Loft Literary Center |url=http://www.jeromefdn.org/grantees/2008-loft-literary-center-mentor-series}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first year featured New York Times bestselling author [[Marge Piercy]] and Pulitzer Prize-winning poets [[Philip Levine (poet)|Philip Levine]] and [[Galway Kinnell]]. Other programs launched in the organization’s first decade include the McKnight Artist Fellowship in Creative Writing (1982), The Loft Scholarship Fund (1984), and a radio program in collaboration with [[Minnesota Public Radio]] (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The McKnight Foundation: McKnight honors artists selected for fellowships and residencies in 30th year of fellowships program |url=http://www.mcknight.org/newsroom/news-releases/mcknight-honors-artists-selected-for-fellowships-and-residencies-in-30th-year-of-fellowships-program}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Loft membership passed the 2,000 mark, and in 1996 the Loft awarded more than $160,000 in grants to writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social engagement===

The Loft initiated the Amnesty Action Project in 1988, which coordinated letter-writing campaigns on behalf of imprisoned writers as identified by [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Minnesota Historical Society: Loft Literary Center |url=http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00213.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Malawian poet [[Jack Mapanje]] was the first, followed by political prisoners Jaki Seroke, [[Zwelakhe Sisulu]], [[Nguyễn Chí Thiện]], [[Dai Qing]], Lee San-ha, and Bligesu Erenus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Minnesota Historical Society: Loft Literary Center |url=http://www2.mnhs.org/library/findaids/00213.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, WCCO anchor [[Dave Moore (newscaster)|Dave Moore]] read from [[Salman Rushdie]]’s Satanic Verses at the Loft in protest of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]]’s sentence of death on Rushdie. The reading was also a response from the Twin Cities Artistic Community Ad Hoc Committee in Protest of Censorship and Intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Loft hosted a week-long series of events celebrating freedom of expression that coincided with National Banned Books Week. The events included a dialogue with [[Kathy Acker]], [[Amiri Baraka]], and [[Nat Hentoff]]; a reading and forum with [[Lorrie Moore]] and [[Mona Simpson]]; free speech read-ins; and performance art with J. Otis Powell and Patrick Scully at the Rogue Nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000-present===

In 1999, the Loft joined forces with [[Minnesota Center for Book Arts]] and publisher [[Milkweed Editions]] to build the nonprofit literary and book arts center [[Open Book Minneapolis|Open Book]], which opened in May 2000 and is the current home of the Loft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=With Books as a Catalyst, Minneapolis Neighborhood Revives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/realestate/commercial/30books.html|accessdate=2009-03-27 | work=The New York Times | first=Lisa | last=Chamberlain | date=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This move was followed by the launch of the Loft Equilibrium Spoken Word Series in 2002, which was recognized with the Minnesota Nonprofit Anti-Racism Initiative Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Star Tribune:The Loft Literary Center awarded $150,000 grant for spoken word|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/blogs/152329425.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the Loft hosted a reading by former senator and anti-war presidential candidate [[Eugene McCarthy]], and collaborated with the [[Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] and [[Minnesota International Center]] to host a discussion and book signing by former Secretary of State [[Madeleine Albright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Loft celebrated its 35th anniversary with the publication release of ''Views from the Loft: A Portable Writer's Workshop'' and the launch of its online education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Publishers Weekly: Views from the Loft: A Portable Writer's Workshop|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-57131-323-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: History |url=https://www.loft.org/about/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Loft now has an annual budget of over $2.4 million, and through contracts, awards, and grants pays writers more than $400,000 each year. The Loft annually serves thousands of writers by offering hundreds of classes, numerous fellowships, readings from award-winning authors, and literary resources such as a small library, writing studios, and a book club room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Resources |url=https://www.loft.org/resources/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the Loft hired 227 writers to teach 323 classes and 5 conferences. In their evaluations, 96% of students reported that their class helped them improve their writing, 91% identified their next steps as a writer, and 94% would recommend their class to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Loft Literary Center: Annual Report |url=https://www.loft.org/about/annual_report/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jocelyn Hale has been Executive Director since 2007, when she replaced long-time leader Linda Myers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Loft Literary Center names new director |url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/07/20/loftdirector/|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8125">'''Theoretical linguistics''', or '''general linguistics''', is the branch of [[linguistics]] which inquires into the nature of [[language]] itself and seeks to answer fundamental questions as to what language is; how it works; how [[universal grammar]] (UG) as a domain-specific mental organ operates, if it exists at all; what are its unique properties; how does language relate to other cognitive processes, etc. Theoretical linguists are most concerned with constructing models of linguistic knowledge, and ultimately developing a linguistic theory.

The fields that are generally considered the core of theoretical linguistics are phonology, [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], syntax, and semantics. Although [[phonetics]] often guides phonology, it is often excluded from the purview of theoretical linguistics, along with [[semantics]]. Theoretical linguistics also involves the search for an explanation of linguistic universals, that is, properties that all, or many [[language]]s have in common.

==Terminology==

In the first half of the 20th century, the term "general linguistics" was more common (cf. Ferdinand de Saussure's famous ''Course in General Linguistics''), which could be contrasted with "language-particular linguistics" (which is more often called [[descriptive linguistics]]). Since the 1960s, the term "theoretical linguistics" has typically been used in more or less the same sense as "general linguistics", even though it also contrasts with [[applied linguistics]], and even though it is often said that language description is inherently theoretical. The usual terminology is thus not entirely clear and consistent.

==Major fields==
{{See|grammar|formal grammar|grammar framework}}

===Phonetics===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

Phonetics is the study of speech sounds with concentration on three main points :
* Manner of articulation|Articulation: the production of speech sounds in human speech organs.
* [[Perception]] : the way human ears respond to speech signals, how the human brain analyses them.
* Acoustic features : physical characteristics of speech sounds such as, loudness, amplitude, frequency etc.
According to this definition, phonetics can also be called linguistic analysis of human speech at the surface level. That is one obvious difference from [[phonology]], which concerns the structure and organisation of speech sounds in natural languages, and furthermore has a theoretical and abstract nature. One example can be made to illustrate this distinction:
In English, the suffix ''-s'' can represent either {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, or can be silent (written Ø) depending on context.
 
====Articulatory phonetics====

The field of [[articulatory phonetics]] is a subfield of phonetics. In studying [[Manner of articulation|articulation]], phoneticians attempt to document how humans produce speech sounds (vowels and consonants). That is, articulatory phoneticians are interested in how the different structures of the vocal tract, called the articulators (tongue, lips, jaw, palate, teeth etc.), interact to create the specific sounds.

====Auditory phonetics====

[[Auditory phonetics]] is a branch of phonetics concerned with the hearing, acquisition and comprehension of phonetic sounds of words of a language.  As articulatory phonetics explores the methods of sound production, auditory phonetics explores the methods of reception—the ear to the brain, and those processes.

====Acoustic phonetics====

[[Acoustic phonetics]] is a subfield of phonetics which deals with acoustic aspects of speech sounds. Acoustic phonetics investigates properties like the mean squared amplitude of a waveform, its duration, its [[fundamental frequency]], or other properties of its frequency spectrum, and the relationship of these properties to other branches of phonetics (e.g. articulatory or auditory phonetics), and to abstract linguistic concepts like phones, phrases, or utterances.

=== Phonology ===
{{See|Phonology}}

[[Phonology]] (sometimes called ''phonemics'' or ''phonematics'') is the study of how sounds are used in languages to convey meaning. Phonology includes topics such as [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].

The basic unit of analysis for phonology is called [[phoneme]]. A phoneme is a group of sounds which are not distinguished by the language rules in determining the meaning. In English, for example, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[tʰ]}} are different [[allophone]]s that represent a single phoneme {{IPA|/t/}}.

===Morphology===
[[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is the study of the internal structure of words. For example, in the sentences ''The dog runs'' and ''The dogs run'', the [[word form]]s ''runs'' and ''dogs'' have an affix ''-s'' added, distinguishing them from the base forms ''dog'' and ''run''. Adding this suffix to a [[noun|nominal]] stem gives plural forms, adding it to [[verb]]al stems restricts the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] to third person singular. Some morphological theories operate with two distinct suffixes ''-s'', called [[allomorph]]s of the [[morpheme]]s Plural and Third person singular, respectively. Languages differ with respect to their morphological structure. Along one axis, we may distinguish [[analytic language]]s, with few or no affixes or other morphological processes from [[synthetic language]]s with many affixes. Along another axis, we may distinguish [[agglutinative language]]s, where affixes express one grammatical property each, and are added neatly one after another, from [[fusional language]]s, with non-concatenative morphological processes ([[infixation]], [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]], [[ablaut]], etc.) and/or with less clear-cut affix boundaries.

===Syntax===
[[Syntax]] is the study of language structure and phrasal hierarchies, depicted in [[parse tree]] format. It is concerned with the relationship between units at the level of words or morphology. Syntax seeks to exactly delineate all and only those sentences which make up a given language, using  native speaker intuition. Syntax seeks to formally describe exactly how structural relations between elements (lexical items/words and operators) in a sentence contribute to its interpretation. Syntax uses principles of formal logic and Set Theory to formalize and accurately represent the hierarchical relationship between elements in a sentence. [[Abstract syntax tree]]s are often used to illustrate the hierarchical structures that are posited. Thus, in active declarative sentences in English the subject is followed by the main verb which in turn is followed by the object (SVO). This order of elements is crucial to its correct interpretation and it is exactly this which syntacticians try to capture. They argue that there must be a formal computational component contained within the language faculty of normal speakers of a language and seek to describe it.

===Semantics===
[[Semantics]] is the study of [[intension]], that is, the intrinsic meanings of words and phrases. Much of the work in the field of [[philosophy of language]] is concerned with the relation between meanings and the word, and this concern cross-cuts formal semantics in several ways. For example, both philosophers of language and semanticists make use of propositional, predicate and modal logics to express their ideas about word meaning.

{{Women in society sidebar}}
This is a '''timeline''' of [[women in computing]]. It covers the time when women worked as "[[Human computer|human computers]]" and then as programmers of physical computers. Eventually, women programmers went on to write software, develop Internet technologies and other types of programming. Women have also been involved in [[computer science]], various related types of engineering and computer hardware.

[[File:Storm Drain.JPG|thumb|Urban runoff flowing into a storm drain]]
'''Urban runoff''' is [[surface runoff]] of rainwater created by [[urbanization]]. This runoff is a major source of [[Flood#Urban flooding|flooding]] and [[water pollution]] in urban communities worldwide.

[[Impervious surfaces]] ([[road]]s, [[parking lot]]s and [[sidewalk]]s) are constructed during [[land development]]. During [[rain]] storms and other [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] events, these surfaces (built from materials such as [[asphalt]] and [[concrete]]), along with [[roof]]tops, carry polluted [[stormwater]] to [[storm drains]], instead of allowing the water to [[Infiltration (hydrology)|percolate]] through [[soil]].&lt;ref name="USGS-runoff"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/runoff.html |title=Runoff (surface water runoff) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-02 |website=USGS Water Science School |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) |location=Reston, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes lowering of the [[water table]] (because [[groundwater recharge]] is lessened) and [[flood]]ing since the amount of water that remains on the surface is greater.&lt;ref name="ASCE1"&gt;[http://wef.org/ Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org/ American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA.

This excess water can also make its way into people's properties through basement backups and seepage through building wall and floors.

[[File:Natural &amp; impervious cover diagrams EPA.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Relationship between [[impervious surfaces]] and [[surface runoff]]]]
Urban runoff is a major cause of [[Flood#Urban flooding|urban flooding]], the inundation of land or property in a built-up environment caused by rainfall overwhelming the capacity of [[drainage|drainage systems]], such as [[storm sewers]].&lt;ref name="USGS-water cycle"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclerunoff.html |title=Surface Runoff - The Water Cycle |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-15 |website=USGS Water Science School |publisher=USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Triggered by events such as [[flash flooding]], [[storm surges]], overbank flooding, or [[snow melt]], urban flooding is characterized by its repetitive, costly and systemic impacts on communities, regardless of whether or not these communities are located within formally designated floodplains or near any body of water.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL [http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf "The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding."] May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several ways in which stormwater enters properties: backup through sewer pipes, toilets and sinks into buildings; seepage through building walls and floors; the accumulation of water on property and in public rights-of-way; and the overflow of water from water bodies such as rivers and lakes. Where properties are built with [[basements]], urban flooding is the primary cause of basement flooding.

Flood flows in urban environments have been investigated relatively recently despite many centuries of flood events.&lt;ref name=Chanson_2011c&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:243550|title=Turbulent Velocity and Suspended Sediment Concentration Measurements in an Urban Environment of the Brisbane River Flood Plain at Gardens Point on 12–13 January 2011|journal=Hydraulic Model Report No. CH83/11 |year=2011|issue=CH83/11|pages=120 pp|first1=Richard |last1=Brown|authorlink2=Hubert Chanson|first2=Hubert |last2=Chanson|first3= Dave |last3=McIntosh |first4= Jay |last4=Madhani|publisher= The University of Queensland, School of Civil Engineering |location=Brisbane, Australia|isbn=978-1-74272-027-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers mentioned the storage effect in urban areas. Several studies looked into the flow patterns and redistribution in streets during storm events and the implication in terms of flood modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Identifiability of Distributed Floodplain Roughness Values in Flood Extent Estimation|journal=Journal of Hydrology |year=2006|volume=314|pages=139–157|first1=MGF |last1=Werner|first2= NM |last2=Hunter|first3= PD |last3=Bates |doi=10.1016/j.jhydrol.2005.03.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent research considered the criteria for safe evacuation of individuals in flooded areas.&lt;ref name="Chanson_2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson|Chanson, H.]], Brown, R., McIntosh, D. |title= Human body stability in floodwaters: the 2011 flood in Brisbane CBD  | url= https://dx.doi.org/10.14264/uql.2014.48 |publisher=Proceedings of the 5th IAHR International Symposium on Hydraulic Structures (ISHS2014), 25–27 June 2014, Brisbane, Australia, H.

==Pollutants==
[[File:Pollutedflood.JPG|thumb|A creek filled with urban runoff after a storm]]
Water running off these impervious surfaces tends to pick up [[gasoline]], [[motor oil]], [[heavy metals]], [[waste|trash]] and other pollutants from roadways and parking lots, as well as [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]] from lawns. Roads and parking lots are major sources of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s (PAHs), which are created as [[combustion]] byproducts of gasoline and other [[fossil fuel]]s, as well as of the heavy metals [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], and [[lead]]. Roof runoff contributes high levels of [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[organic compound]]s and [[zinc]] (from [[galvanization|galvanized]] gutters). Fertilizer use on residential lawns, parks and golf courses is a measurable source of [[nitrates]] and [[phosphorus]] in urban runoff when fertilizer is improperly applied or when turf is over-fertilized.&lt;ref name="ASCE1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stormwater Effects Handbook: A Toolbox for Watershed Managers, Scientists, and Engineers|authors=G. Allen Burton, Jr., Robert Pitt|publisher=CRC/Lewis Publishers|location=New York|year=2001|isbn=0-87371-924-7|url=http://unix.eng.ua.edu/~rpitt/Publications/BooksandReports/Stormwater%20Effects%20Handbook%20by%20%20Burton%20and%20Pitt%20book/MainEDFS_Book.html}} Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eroding soils or poorly maintained construction sites can often lead to increased [[Nonpoint source pollution#Sediment|sedimentation]] in runoff. Sedimentation often settles to the bottom of water bodies and can directly affect water quality. Excessive levels of sediment in water bodies can increase the risk of infection and disease through high levels of nutrients present in the soil. These high levels of nutrients can reduce oxygen and boost algae growth while limiting native vegetation growth. Limited native vegetation and excessive algae has the potential to disrupt the entire aquatic ecosystem due to limited light penetration, lower oxygen levels, and reduced food reserves. Excessive levels of sediment and [[suspended solids]] have the potential to damage existing infrastructure as well.  Sedimentation can increase runoff by plugging underground injection systems, thereby increasing the amount of runoff on the surface. Increased sedimentation levels can also reduce storage behind reservoirs.  This reduction of reservoir capacities can lead to increased expenses for public land agencies while also impacting the quality of water recreational areas.&lt;ref&gt;Oregon Environmental Council. Chapter 1: Impacts of urban stormwater runoff. Retrieved from website: http://www.oeconline.org/our-work/rivers/stormwater/stormwater report/impacts&lt;/ref&gt;

Runoff can also induce heavy metal poisoning in ocean life. Small amounts of heavy metals are carried by runoff into the oceans. These metals are ingested by ocean life. These heavy metals cannot be disposed so they accumulate within the animals. Over time, these metals build up to a toxic level, and the animal dies. This heavy metal poisoning can also affect humans. If we eat a poisoned animal, we have a chance of getting heavy metal poisoning too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bortman|first1=Marci|title=Marine Pollution|journal=Environmental Encyclopedia|date=2011|volume=3|pages=21–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weiss|first1=Kenneth R.|title=Endangered Oceans|date=2009|publisher=Glenhaven Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|pages=39–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As stormwater is channeled into storm drains and surface waters, the natural [[sediment]] load discharged to receiving waters decreases, but the water flow and velocity increases. In fact, the impervious cover in a typical city creates five times the runoff of a typical woodland of the same size.&lt;ref name="EPA2"&gt;{{cite report |date=February 2003 |title=Protecting Water Quality from Urban Runoff |url=https://www.epa.gov/polluted-runoff-nonpoint-source-pollution/nonpoint-source-fact-sheets |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 841-F-03-003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
A 2008 report by the [[United States National Research Council]] (textbox below) identified urban runoff as a leading source of [[water quality]] problems.
&lt;blockquote class="toccolours" style="width:25%; float:right; padding:10px 15px; display:table;"&gt;...further declines in water quality remain likely if the land-use changes that typify more diffuse sources of pollution are not addressed... These include land-disturbing agricultural, silvicultural, urban, industrial, and construction activities from which hard-to-monitor pollutants emerge during wet-weather events. Pollution from these landscapes has been almost universally acknowledged as the most pressing challenge to the restoration of waterbodies and aquatic ecosystems nationwide.&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Weaselbrgrandavpassaicjeh.JPG|thumb|Weasel Brook in [[Passaic, New Jersey]] has been [[River engineering#Channelization|channelized]] with concrete walls to control localized flooding.]]

The runoff also increases temperatures in streams, harming [[fish]] and other organisms. (A sudden burst of runoff from a rainstorm can cause a fish-killing shock of hot water.) Also, [[road salt]] used to melt snow on sidewalks and roadways can contaminate streams and groundwater [[aquifer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;United States Geological Survey. Atlanta, GA. [http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/urbanrun.html "The effects of urbanization on water quality: Urban runoff."] Accessed 2009-12-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most pronounced effects of urban runoff is on watercourses that historically contained little or no water during dry weather periods (often called ''[[ephemeral stream]]s''). When an area around such a stream is [[urbanization|urbanized]], the resultant runoff creates an unnatural year-round [[streamflow]] that hurts the vegetation, [[wildlife]] and [[stream bed]] of the waterway. Containing little or no sediment relative to the historic ratio of sediment to water, urban runoff rushes down the stream channel, ruining natural features such as [[meander]]s and [[sandbar]]s, and creates severe erosion—increasing sediment loads at the mouth while severely incising the [[stream bed]] upstream. As an example, on many [[Southern California]] beaches at the mouth of a waterway, urban runoff carries trash, pollutants, excessive silt, and other wastes, and can pose moderate to severe health hazards.

Because of fertilizer and organic waste that urban runoff often carries, [[eutrophication]] often occurs in waterways affected by this type of runoff. After heavy rains, organic matter in the waterway is relatively high compared with natural levels, spurring growth of [[algae]] blooms that soon consume most of the [[oxygen]]. Once the naturally occurring oxygen in the water is depleted, the algae blooms die, and their decomposition causes further eutrophication. Algae blooms mostly occur in areas with still water, such as [[stream pool]]s and the pools behind [[dam]]s, [[weir]]s, and some [[drop structure]]s. Eutrophication usually comes with deadly consequences for fish and other aquatic organisms.

Excessive stream bank erosion may cause flooding and property damage. For many years governments have often responded to urban stream erosion problems by [[river engineering]] through construction of hardened [[levee|embankments]] and similar control structures using concrete and masonry materials. Use of these hard materials destroys habitat for fish and other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laws |first1=Edward A. |last2=Roth |first2=Lauren |year=2004 |title=Impact of Stream Hardening on Water Quality and Metabolic Characteristics of Waimanalo and Kane'ohe Streams, O'ahu, Hawaiian Islands |journal=Pacific Science |publisher= University of Hawai'i Press |volume=58 |issue=2 |pages= |hdl=10125/2725 |doi= 10.1353/psc.2004.0019|issn=0030-8870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a project may stabilize the immediate area where flood damage occurred, but often it simply shifts the problem to an upstream or downstream segment of the stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2007 |title=National Management Measures to Control Nonpoint Source Pollution from Hydromodification |chapter=Ch. 3.

Urban flooding has significant economic implications. In the US, industry experts estimate that wet basements can lower property values by 10%-25% and are cited among the top reasons for not purchasing a home.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.cnt.org/media/CNT_PrevalenceAndCostOfUrbanFlooding.pdf "The Prevalence and Cost of Urban Flooding."] May 2013, Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago IL.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|U.S Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]], almost 40% of small businesses never reopen their doors following a flooding disaster.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Emergency Management Agency (U.S.). "Protecting Your Businesses," last updated March, 2013, http://www.fema.gov/protecting-yourbusinesses  {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130917193030/http://www.fema.gov/protecting-yourbusinesses |date=2013-09-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], urban flooding is estimated to cost £270 million a year in [[England]] and [[Wales]]; 80,000 homes are at risk.&lt;ref&gt;Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, London, UK. [http://www.parliament.uk/documents/post/postpn289.pdf "Urban Flooding."]  Postnote 289, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[Cook County, Illinois]], identified 177,000 property damage insurance claims made across 96% of the county's ZIP codes over a five-year period from 2007-2011. This is the equivalent of one in six properties in the County making a claim. Average payouts per claim were $3,733 across all types of claims, with total claims amounting to $660 million over the five years examined.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Despite concerted efforts, many communities lack the funds to fully address these issues, and often seek funds elsewhere. Numerous watersheds within [[Los Angeles County, California]] do not meet state water quality standards, despite spending $100 million a year on clean water programs to combat issues such as urban runoff. To combat this problem, officials have introduced a measure that would assess a fee to homeowners and local businesses in attempt to raise $290 million for effective urban runoff management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sewell |first=Abby |date=2013-01-03 |title=County seeks parcel fee to pay for projects to combat urban runoff |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/03/local/la-me-adv-stormwater-20130103 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective control of urban runoff involves reducing the velocity and flow of stormwater, as well as reducing pollutant discharges. A variety of stormwater management practices and systems may be used to reduce the effects of urban runoff. Some of these techniques (called [[best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] (BMPs) in the US), focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 1999 |title=Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices |chapter=Ch. 5: Description and Performance of Storm Water Best Management Practices |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-wastewater-studies-miscellaneous |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-821-R-99-012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Pollution prevention practices include [[Low-impact development (Canada/US)|low impact development (LID)]] or [[green infrastructure]] techniques - known as [[Sustainable drainage system|Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)]] in the UK, and [[Water-sensitive urban design|Water-Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD)]] in Australia and the Middle East - such as the installation of [[green roof]]s and improved chemical handling (e.g. management of motor fuels &amp; oil, fertilizers and pesticides).&lt;ref name="EPA2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA3"&gt;{{cite AV media |year=2009 |title=Reduce Runoff: Slow It Down, Spread It Out, Soak It In |medium=Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huO_NRn34GI |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runoff mitigation systems include [[infiltration basin]]s, [[bioretention]] systems, [[constructed wetland]]s, [[retention basin]]s and similar devices.&lt;ref&gt;California Stormwater Quality Association. Menlo Park, CA. [http://www.cabmphandbooks.com/ "Stormwater Best Management Practice (BMP) Handbooks."] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Trenton, NJ. [http://www.njstormwater.org/bmp_manual2.htm "New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual."] April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Providing effective urban runoff solutions often requires proper city programs that take into account the needs and differences of the community. Factors such as a city's mean temperature, precipitation levels, geographical location, and airborne pollutant levels can all affect rates of pollution in urban runoff and present unique challenges for management. Human factors such as urbanization rates, land use trends, and chosen building materials for impervious surfaces often exacerbate these issues.

The implementation of citywide maintenance strategies such as street sweeping programs can also be an effective method in improving the quality of urban runoff. [[Street sweeper|Street sweeping vacuums]] collect particles of dust and suspended solids often found in public parking lots and roads that often end up in runoff.&lt;ref name="EPA4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Parking-Lot-and-Street-Cleaning.cfm |title=Parking Lot and Street Cleaning |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828022543/http://water.epa.gov/polwaste/npdes/swbmp/Parking-Lot-and-Street-Cleaning.cfm |archive-date=2015-08-28 |website=National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices |publisher=EPA |accessdate=2014-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yellow Fish.jpg|thumb|Blue drain and yellow fish symbol used by the UK Environment Agency to raise awareness of the ecological impacts of contaminating surface drainage]]Educational programs can also be an effective tool for managing urban runoff. Local businesses and individuals can have an integral role in reducing pollution in urban runoff simply through their practices, but often are unaware of regulations. Creating a productive discussion on urban runoff and the importance of effective disposal of household items can help to encourage environmentally friendly practices at a reduced cost to the city and local economy.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:LatinamericaWasteWaterNorm.png|thumb|right|Requirements of wastewater sewer discharge in Latin America|350px]]

'''Wastewater discharge standards''' protect [[Water supply|water sources]] from [[Water pollution|pollution]] and mismanagement. Each country in [[Latin America]] has its own set of standards, and these vary according to types of water use, agricultural, industrial or recreational use. [[Water quality]] is maintained by controlling the [[physical chemistry|physicochemical]] and [[bacteriology|bacteriological parameters]]. The majority of water laws include fines for noncompliance. In many cases fines are inadequate and do not stop offending. In some cases the standards are lax and monitoring inadequate.

In this paper is presented a summary of the majority of [[wastewater]] discharge standards in Latin America, complemented with a country ranking considering the quantity and severity of their regulations. Also, a comparative analysis of relevant standards is made, and a real case description for each country when the regulation was not accomplished.

==Chile==

In this country, the [[Ministry of Public Works (Chile)|Ministry of Publics Works]] developed the standard, the decrete number 609,&lt;ref name=CL&gt;Chilean Ministry of Public Works, NORMA DE EMISION PARA LA REGULACION DE CONTAMINANTES ASOCIADOS A LAS DESCARGAS DE RESIDUOS INDUSTRIALES LIQUIDOS A SISTEMAS DE ALCANTARILLADO,1998&lt;/ref&gt; approved on May 7, 1998. This norm was created with the aim to control the effluents discharged into the [[Sewerage|sewer system]]. This norm establishes the maximum discharge concentration in sewer systems and also the different parameters that will be monitored, depending on the economic activity developed by each industry. It also establishes the methods that must be used for taking samples of each parameter.
The control of the norm is responsibility of the company that provides the service of recollection of wastewater, being the regulator of sanitary services companies the main responsible. If a company produces disruption in the service, in terms of quality or quantity of the recollection, the companies of recollection of wastewater could suspend the service to that company.

'''Case description'''

In May 2009 Aguas Andinas, controlled by the Spanish Enterprise [[Grupo Agbar|Agbar]], will pay a fine because of a lawsuit presented against it by a group of neighbours because of the foul smells coming from the "La Farfana", a [[Water treatment|waste water treatment plant]]. This is one of the waste water recycling plants of Aguas Andinas. This bad odours caused [[Gastrointestinal tract|digestive]] and [[Psychology|psychological]] problems. The organization announced that it will appeal this judgement, based on the argument that it was due to a couple of precise episodes beyond its control that did not cause any environmental or personal harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Ediciones Financieras S.A. |url=http://df.cl/portal2/content/df/ediciones/20090505/cont_111663.html |title=Aguas Andinas deberá pagar multa por US$4 millones a vecinos |publisher=Diario Financiero Online |date=May 5, 2009 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, the Sanitary Services Superintedent's Office (SISS) started a lawsuit against the paper company Licancel after “not complying with the 90 Supreme Decrete, that regulates waste water disposals”.
As the Superintedent's Office said, this decision is based on the investigation been forwarded that confirmed that this organization discharged its waste water without complying with the norm. As legislation establishes this office can propose and apply the corresponding sanctions, such as fines between one and a thousand Annual Tributary Units (UTA). This means  around 392 Million Pesos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20070613/pags/20070613213522.html |title=Superintendencia de Servicios Sanitarios comenzó proceso de sanción contra Celco |publisher=La Nación |date=June 14, 2007 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolivia==

The norm for discharge, is under the law 1333, approved on April 27, 1992. This law is the general law of environment, and for the specific case was created a regulation for water pollution.&lt;ref name=BL&gt;CONGRESO NACIONAL DE BOLIVIA, LEY N°1333 DEL MEDIO AMBIENTE,REGLAMENTACIÓN DE LA LEY N°1333 DEL MEDIO AMBIENTE REGLAMENTO EN MATERIA DE CONTAMINACIÓN HÍDRICA, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

This regulation is applied to every entity that produces a contamination on the water. In the case of the discharge over sewer systems the regulation is under the Chapter IV. It's stated that every company must agree with the company that provides the service of recollection of wastewater, the limits of discharge. The limits presented in this article, are those for new companies and for companies in process of identification of the type of body water that the company will discharge.

'''Case description'''

In August 2003, all the mining producers working in the city of [[Potosí]] must discharge their waste waters to a specific dike; otherwise they will be obliged to stop their operations. This statement, made by the director of Environment and Sustainable development, Limbert Paredes, who pointed out that this agreement was taken between the Mining Engineers Association of Potosí, law representatives and authorities of the Potosí County.
These companies installed in the upper side of the city must build a pipeline to discharge their waste water by the end of June 2003, which was not done. Because of this, a new meeting was held and a new deadline was given; August 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Edgar A. Amador |last=Pinto |url=http://www.ops.org.bo/servicios/?DB=B&amp;S11=4831&amp;SE=SN |title=Contaminacion de rios |publisher=Organizacion Panamericana de la Salud – Bolivia |date=August 3, 2004 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009. The neighbors of the “Mercado Walter Khon” have demand attention from local authorities because streets were flooded with waste water coming out from the sewers. Because of this social pressure, the city council made the maintenance and cleaning of the sewers close by the area where waters arose.
Besides some maintenance facts that helped in the flooding, the city council does not restore the S-2 pumping station. Therefore, the wastewater is not properly pumped into the treatment plant.
According to the city's responsible, Marcelo Vidal, because of the constant rain added to garbage and plastic bags, the sewer system is not working properly. Even though he pointed that the main problem's origin is in the pumping station, the situation has not been solved up to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Edgar A. Amador |last=Pinto |url=http://www.ops.org.bo/servicios/?DB=B&amp;S11=15302&amp;SE=SN |title=Aún no funcionan estaciones elevadoras y provocan reflujos de aguas servidas |publisher=Organizacion Panamericana de la Salud – Bolivia |date=February 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peru==

In [[Peru]], the norm has only few parameters with limits.&lt;ref name=PE1&gt;Superintendencia de Agua Potable de Lima, REGLAMENTO DE DESAGÜES INDUSTRIALES DECRETO LEY N° 28-60-SAPL,1960&lt;/ref&gt; These parameters are: temperature (35&amp;nbsp;°C), fats and oil (100&amp;nbsp;mg/lt), PH (5 – 8.5), BOD (1000&amp;nbsp;mg/lt) and settleable solids.&lt;ref name=PE1 /&gt; However a more comprehensive norm was developed by the ministry of housing, which now is under review and analysis of the [[Ministry of Environment (Peru)|environment ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivienda.gob.pe/ambiente/OMA1.html |title=Oficina del Medio Ambiente |publisher=Ministerio de Vivienda, Construcción y Saneamiento, Peru |date= |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present article, the values presented are the ones under approval.&lt;ref name=PE2&gt;Ministry of Housing, APRUEBAN LÍMITES MÁXIMOS PERMISIBLES(LMP) A LAS DESCARGAS DE AGUAS RESIDUALES EN LOS SISTEMAS DE RECOLECCIÓN DE ALCANTARILLADO SANITARIO&lt;/ref&gt; This new regulation was developed because of the damage that industrial wastewater is causing to the sewer system. For example, in year 2006 a study showed that 58% of the sample (24 companies) surpassed the limit of BOD5 established in the current norm.&lt;ref name=PE2 /&gt; In the same year other study showed that 57% of the sample (9 companies) surpassed the same norm.&lt;ref name=PE2 /&gt;

'''Case description'''

On 2010, water quality is one of the main problems of this country. Only 25% of the domestic water is treated, and the rest of it is thrown into rivers and lakes. This is why a series of measures have been addressed by government. In April 2010, the “National Authority of Water”  will implement different laboratories in order to determine the pollution degree of wastewater from industries. Penalties of up to 36 million Soles have been announced for companies that not treat their residual waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://radio.rpp.com.pe/cuidaelagua/habra-multas-para-empresas-que-no-trate-sus-aguas-residuales/ |title=Habrá multas para empresas que no trate sus aguas residuales &amp;#124; Cuida el agua |publisher=GrupoRPP |date=March 26, 2010 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==

In the case of this country, the parameters presented correspond to the [[Federal District (Brazil)|federal district]]. The regulation of the parameters is under the decree N°18.328 of June 8, 1997.&lt;ref name=BR&gt;DO LANÇAMENTO DE EFLUENTES LÍQUIDOS NA REDE COLETORA DE ESGOTOS – DEC 18.328 DE 18.06.97, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In the norm is established the maximum limit for industrial effluents in the federal district. Also it's stated the fines applied in the case the companies surpass the norm. Also the decree indicates the type of industry and the types of parameters, that each of them must control.

==Ecuador==

The norm that regulates the limits of discharge in [[Ecuador]], is under the general law of environmental management,&lt;ref name=EC&gt;Congreso Nacional, CODIFICACIÓN 2004-019, LEY DE GESTIÓN AMBIENTAL&lt;/ref&gt; and was created with the aim of regulate the discharge over sewer systems, criteria of water quality for several uses and the procedures for measuring the parameters on the water.&lt;ref&gt;Ministerio del Medio Ambiente de Ecuador, Libro VI de la Calidad Ambiental, NORMA DE CALIDAD AMBIENTAL Y DE DESCARGA DE EFLUENTES : RECURSO AGUA&lt;/ref&gt; Also the norm establishes that companies must keep a record of the generated effluents with the main operational data related to the effluents.&lt;ref name=EC /&gt;

'''Case description'''

In December 2009, the Environment Ministry fined on November 25, five companies of [[Manta, Ecuador|Manta]] and [[Montecristi, Ecuador|Montecristi]] with US$43,600 after the failure to execute the environmental policy. These companies: SEAFMAN C.A., Treatment plant IROTOP S.A., LA FABRIL S.A., EUROFISH S.A., Y GONDI S.A. have to pay immediately. The results of laboratory samples proved that levels of different substances were over the limits that were established in the Environment Quality and Waste Water Regulations. An action plan has been implemented to avoid the surpass of the limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.codeso.com/PrensaEcuador/091201-El-Ciudadano-Ministerio-Ambiente-multa-industrias-contaminar.html |title=Ministerio del Ambiente multó a cinco industrias por contaminar |publisher=El Ciudadano Ecuador |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, in "Manglares" of "El Salvado", the fauna and flora which are extremely variate, are being affected by households and companies, because of loads coming from thermal power plants. Such discharges generate high temperatures (more than 35℃) that exceed the accepted and established limits, and in consequence the ecosystem is suffering irreversible damages.
Companies like "Categ" and "Electroguayas" have been forced to pay US$1000 fine, but this has not stopped this situation. Other company called "Interagua" has announced a new project that considers water treatment system for this area. The same is planned for Puerto Azul and the rest of the nearby cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.planamanecer.com/portada/Actualidad%20%7C%20Noticias/content/modo/view/id/85/Itemid/7 |title=La reserva Manglares de El Salado está en peligro |publisher=Planamanecer.com |date=December 18, 2007 |first=Marialuz |last=Albuja |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argentina==

The national law that regulates water resource in Argentina is the Decree 674 of 1989,&lt;ref name=AR&gt;National Decree 674 of 1989. Decreto reglamentario de la Ley 13.577 de Obras Sanitarias de la Nación. http://www2.medioambiente.gov.ar/mlegal/agua/dec674_89.htm&lt;/ref&gt; established by the National Executive Power and applies to the Federal Capital and all the parties of [[Buenos Aires Province]] that are subscribed to the National Sanitary Works Entity regime. The aim of the law is to protect national water resources in means of good water usage, water pollution and the good functioning of the National Sanitary Works Entity installations.
As well, it's applied the Resolution 79179 of 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Disposición 79179/90. Disposiciones instrumentales para la aplicación del Decreto Nº674/89.http://www2.medioambiente.gov.ar/mlegal/agua/disp79179_90.htm&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the instrumental arrangements for the Decree 674 implementation. This Resolution includes wastewater discharging parameters to sewer system, water course and rainwater collectors, which are included in Annex A of it.

'''Case Description'''

In June 2006, in Argentina the concentration of different natural heavy materials, bacteries, nitrates and hydrocarbons exceed by much the figures considered dangerous. It is not by chance that rivers like the Paraná, [[Salado del Norte]], [[Salado del Sur River|Salado del Sur]], [[Carcarañá River|Carcarañá]], [[De La Plata River|de la Plata]] and [[Colorado River|Colorado]] are among the most polluted of the earth. Argentina does not have control means for [[wastewater treatment]] or disposal. There is information that relates about important and numerous water bodies being affected by wastewater disposal, with intense [[eutrophication]] processes due to the lack of treatment.

One out of four hospital beds is occupied by someone with a water related illness. In some inner areas of the country, like [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]] and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], water bodies are so polluted that the work in the water treatment plants has been affected. There are some projects to build treatment plants in the main locations, but discharges keeps growing.
Disposals from companies added to the domestic ones in the Riachuelo-Matanza sum up to 368,000 cubic meters per day, which is the double of the minimum average flow of the river. The mud in it has great concentrations of Chrome, Copper, Mercury, Zinc, and Lead. In addition, the highest concentrations of Lead and Chrome are located in the border between the councils of [[Avellaneda]] and [[Lanús]], in the Buenos Aires province.
The given treatments are not sufficient by any means, moreover, the treatments done by companies to their waste water are between deficient and non existing. Most of the water consumed by population comes from the same water bodies in which waste and domestic water is dumped, and because of the lack of treatment these populations ends up drinking water of doubtful quality or at a high purification cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecoportal.net/content/view/full/69816 |title=Contaminación, Arsénico y posibles soluciones... |language=Spanish |publisher=EcoPortal |date=June 8, 2007 |first=Cristian |last=Frers |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, a report generated by the Nation's General Audit (AGN) states that the plants that produce water drinkable are also polluting with elements contained in their waste water, which are over the national and provincial legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=806648 |title=Contaminan el río las plantas que potabilizan agua |publisher=La Nacion |date=May 17, 2006 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mexico==

Mexican Law of National Waters regulates water exploitation, use, distribution, control, and the preservation of water quantity and quality.&lt;ref&gt;CONGRESO DE LOS ESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS. 1992. Ley de Aguas Nacionales.http://www.cddhcu.gob.mx/LeyesBiblio/pdf/16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

To manage the wastewater disposal and control water sources quality, it was created in 1996 by the Environmental, Natural Resources and Fishing Secretarial, the official norm NOM-002-ECOL that establishes the maximum permissible limits of pollutants in wastewater discharges in urban sewer system.  The norm specifies the permissible concentrations of pollutants per day, per month and instantaneous sampling, which are included in Chapter 4 of this norm.&lt;ref name=MX&gt;Secretaría de Medio Ambiente, Recursos Naturales y Pesca. 1996.Norma official mexicana NOM-002-ECOL-1996. http://www2.ine.gob.mx/publicaciones/gacetas/216/cca31.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Case Description'''

In January 2010, members of the Ducks Unlimited Association of Mexico warned of the death of more than 5,000 migratory birds. The specialist from the association assured that the main cause of this episode was the non treated waste waters from industries. He pointed out the real problem of pollution existing in the "De Silva" dam, and in some others dams in the state. He demanded intervention of the National Water Commission (Conagua) and from SEMARNAR, in order to regulate the discharge of waste water that ends up in the Turbio river.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bionero.org/ecologia/mueren-mas-de-cinco-mil-aves-en-presa-de-silva/?searchterm=None |title=Mueren más de 5 mil aves en presa De Silva |language=Spanish |publisher=Bionero |date=January 12, 2010 |author=Gaby Bárcenas; Martín Diego |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the Municipal Commission of Water and Sewer System of Altamira (COMAPA) was fined by the National Water Commission, between 40 and 50 thousand pesos, for not having a water treatment plant as stated by law for all municipalities of the state of Tataulipas. The next stage would be built a pumping station in "La Pedrera" and the facility must be finished this year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://laprensa.mx/notas.asp?id=10865 |title=Comisión Nacional del Agua multa a COMAPA por no tener una planta tratadora de aguas |publisher=La Prensa |date=April 23, 2010 |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colombia==

The main regulator norm for water management is the Decree 1594 of 1984,&lt;ref name=CO&gt;Decree 1594 of 1984.Water usages and wastewater disposal.http://www.alcaldiabogota.gov.co/sisjur/normas/Norma1.jsp?i=18617&lt;/ref&gt; which normalizes water usages and wastewater disposal through all the national territory.  The decree establishes water quality standards, which are guides to be used as a basis for decision making in assignation of water uses and determination of water characteristics for each application. Water discharging parameters to public sewage are described in Chapter VI of this decree.
Also, it was considered the Resolution 3957 of 2009&lt;ref name=CO2&gt;Environmental District Department. Resolution 3957 of 2009.Technical norm, for wastewater discharges management and control in public sewage for the capital district.http://www.secretariadeambiente.gov.co/sda/libreria/pdf/Resolucion_3957.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to enlarge the water parameters comparison in this country. This resolution establishes the technical norm, for wastewater discharges management and control in public sewage for the capital district.

'''Case Description'''

A report published by the [[National University of Colombia|National University]] confirms the presence of Lead, Cadmium, Mercury and Arsenic in plants watered with the polluted water of the [[Bogotá River|Bogotá river]]. According to it, vegetables have high levels of heavy metals that can be dangerous for human health.
For the Regional Autonomous Corporation (CAR) this is due to industrial downloads. In general, levels found in water, soil and vegetables of this area are much higher than the limits allowed by the [[World Health Organization]]. The authors, Soacha y Mosquera show figures much higher than the European Union limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/cundinamarca/hortalizas-regadas-con-aguas-del-rio-bogota-contienen-metales-perjudiciales-para-la-salud_6309887-1 |title=Hortalizas regadas con aguas del río Bogotá contienen metales perjudiciales para la salud |publisher=El Tiempo |date= |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the industrial firm "Coca-Cola Femsa" was fined with 111,000 US$ due to its illegal discharge of industrial water in Bogotá, as informed by the District Environmental of the Capital District of Columbia. A technical report conducted by the Aqueduct and Sewer system of Bogotá proved the existence of some waste water disposal that does not go through the company's treatment plant.

The former Administrative Environmental Department (Dama) has given to the company an allowance for having a downloading point in October 2006, but the Aqueduct and Sewer system of [[Bogotá]] found that place has already four discharge points, none of them registered or authorized.  Since January 2008, those four points were closed down and conducted to a treatment plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vtv.gov.ve/noticias-ciencia-y-salud/11164 |title=Colombia: Coca Cola deberá pagar multa millonaria por contaminación |publisher=Venezolana de Televisión |date=August 15, 2010 |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venezuela==

The Environmental Organic Law of [[Venezuela]] gives the guidelines in terms of water management, as a duty of the state for the protection of watersheds. This in terms of classification and control of the quality of water bodies, control of effluent discharges or fluids susceptible of degrading the aquatic environment and alters the levels of quality required to preserve and improve the environment. The Decree 883 follows these guidelines, being Venezuela's national norm for water classification and control, created in 1995.

The Decree regulates the quality of water bodies and wastewater discharges. This law establishes the different types of water and the permissible parameters for water discharges in accordance to the final water use.  Wastewater discharging parameters to public sewer system are contained in section V of Decree 883.&lt;ref name=VE&gt;Decreto No. 883  de 1995. Normas para la clasificación y el control de la calidad de los cuerpos de agua y vertidos o efluentes líquidos. http://ws-01.ula.ve/ingenieria/jmayorga/agua.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paraguay==

[[Congress of Paraguay]] emitted the Law 1614 of 2000 as the general regulatory and tariff framework for drinking water and sanitary sewer supply.&lt;ref&gt;Ley N° 1.614/2000. LEY GENERAL DEL MARCO REGULATORIO Y TARIFARIO DEL SERVICIO DE AGUA POTABLE Y ALCANTARILLADO SANITARIO.

This regulation includes in its Title VI, all what refers to quality of the performance of sanitary sewer supply. In Annex 10 are shown the maximum limits for physicochemical parameters, specifying discharge values for the type of wastewater treatment applied.&lt;ref name=PA&gt;Reglamento de Calidad en la Prestación del Servicio Permisionarios.http://www.erssan.gov.py/marcolegal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison Analysis==
For purposes of having an idea of the requirements of the regulation, an index was created with the aim to rank the countries. This concept assumes that if a country has tighten limits than other, or if it declares explicitly a limit, then the regulation could be considered more stringent.

This index takes in account all the parameters listed in the table, assuming the following criteria. If a country doesn't have any regulation, then it will get 1, from a scale of 10. If the country has the minimum limit it will get 10 points, if it has the maximum then it will get 5 points. Later, an average is taken from all the parameters of the country, giving the index a relative position of all the countries. Afterwards, all the values are classified using quartiles.
A summary with the values of each country is presented below.

===pH===
The pH is a chemical parameter that measures the acidity or basicity of the water and is commonly measured in situ. Distilled water has a pH of 7,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.water-research.net/ph]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where less than 7 is considered acid and greater than 7 is considered basic. In most cases, low pH is due to organic overloading and low oxygen conditions in the water. This characteristic is strictly controlled because it has a direct effect on water ecosystems and sewer systems materials.

Usually, pH standard is between 6 and 9 and can vary easily depending on the discharge content.   In this case, Peru was the country with the smallest range (6–8) and Argentina and Mexico were the ones with the widest range (5.5–10). No limit was found for Canada Regulation.

===Settleable Solids===
A low concentration of suspended solids in water or even complete removal after treatment is crucial to maintain water ecosystems development. High concentrations of suspended solids can slow down photosynthesis, reduce dissolved oxygen and increase water temperature.

That is why suspended solids is a relevant parameter in wastewater discharge, that can be attribute to both industrial and domestic wastewater. When comparing wastewater regulations, was found that Bolivia has the strictest limit for this parameter (60&amp;nbsp;mg/L) while Colombia presented the highest limit (600&amp;nbsp;mg/L). The value presented for Colombia was extracted from the technical norm for wastewater discharges management and control in public sewage for the capital district. Within these two limit values is shown a big difference among the two countries regulations for these standard, whereas for Canada was encountered an average value of 350&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

===BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;===
The BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; standard is also an indicator of solid's presence in water, but specifically for organic matter. BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;represents the amount of oxygen required by microorganism to stabilize organic material present in wastewater. A higher concentration of BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; means a high load of organic matter to be stabilized by microorganism.

Therefore, Chile has the stricter regulation for BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; permitting wastewater discharges with a value between 33 and 55&amp;nbsp;mg/L. Also, Chile was the only country that presented a range for the limit of this parameter. By the other hand, Colombia has the higher limit with 800&amp;nbsp;mg/L. In this case, is also taken the value from the Capital District Regulation, because there wasn’t a specific value presented in the national norm, just said that BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; removal must be greater than 80% for a new user. In comparison with Canada and the other countries, Chile's limit is a very strict value.

===Arsenic===
Arsenic is considered as a substance of sanitary interest and at the same time is one of the most toxic elements that exist. Arsenic can be found naturally in the environment and also be an essential trace element for some animals. Due to human activities, mainly through mining and melting, Arsenic can now be found on many more places than where they existed naturally.
World production of arsenic, in the form of its oxide, is around 50.000 ton per year. Chile and Mexico are primary exporters of Arsenic. Also, it is mainly emitted by the copper producing industries, but also during lead and zinc production and in agriculture. Arsenic can’t be destroyed once it has entered the environment, which causes severe health effects on humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/water/arsenic/arsenic-and-water.htm#ixzz0mflYN2Bk |title=Arsenic (As) and water : Arsenic and water: reaction mechanisms, environmental impact and health effects |publisher=Lenntech |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned before, Chile and Mexico are primary producers of Arsenic and when checking Arsenic limit values in their regulations aren’t the more severe ones.  Mexico and Brazil are the countries with a higher limit value and Ecuador stays with the lower limit. As Arsenic is also linked with agriculture, it is important to emphasize that the majority of the Latin-American countries are characterized by having an agricultural economy. As a result, limit values encountered for Arsenic in all the Regulations varies from a small range of 0,1 to 1&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

===Cadmium===
Cadmium is also considered as a substance of sanitary interest. Although, it can be found naturally in the environment and it always occurs in combination with zinc. In industry is a by-product of zinc, lead and copper extraction. Also is found in many manures and pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/as.htm#ixzz0mfjFkotg |title=Arsenic (As) – Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects |publisher=Lenntech |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cadmium can easily end up in soils and transported to surface waters when using manures and pesticides.  Actually, regulations for Cadmium are strict, so little Cadmium enters the water through disposal of wastewater.

The main producing country is of zinc is Canada, with Mexico and Peru also being ones of the major suppliers.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;CIA. The world Factbook. https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In the regulations comparison, Cadmium standard was more severe in Ecuador with an acceptance of 0,02&amp;nbsp;mg/L, whilst Brazil was the laxer one with 1,5&amp;nbsp;mg/L. For the case of Canada, Mexico and Peru, the latter has the stricter limit among them with 0,2&amp;nbsp;mg/L, while the other two remain in the average with 0,7&amp;nbsp;mg/L.

===Cyanide===
Cyanide, a substance of sanitary concern, is only due to use and discharge of the industrial sector. Cyanide has severe effects both in human health and ecosystems. The severity of the harmful effects following cyanide exposure depends in part on the form of cyanide, such as hydrogen cyanide gas or cyanide salts. It becomes more dangerous when exposure concentrations are high.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts8.html#bookmark03&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanide has been a major component of metal-plating solutions and is mainly produced for the mining of gold and silver mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyanidecode.org/cyanide_environmental.php |title=Environmental and Health Effects of Cyanide |publisher=International Cyanide Management Institute |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of Latino-American regulations, Argentina is the country that presents the harshner limit value with 0,1&amp;nbsp;mg/L. By the contrary, Mexico was the one with the higher limit value with 1,5&amp;nbsp;mg/L.
Among the Latin-American countries, Colombia is the only one that is mentioned as having gold mining industry.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;  The limit value for Cyanide is quite high (1&amp;nbsp;mg/L) to the limit value of Argentina. However, three more other countries have the same limit value for Cyanide.

===Hexavalent chromium===
This is a toxic component, that could cause allergic reactions on the skin and also several problems in the respiratory system.&lt;ref name =CR&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/cr.htm |title=Chromium (Cr) – Chemical properties, Health and Environmental effects |publisher=Lenntech |date= |accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a component present in the industries of chemicals, leather, textile, electro painting among others.&lt;ref name=CR /&gt;

The minimum requirement for this element is presented in Bolivia (0.1&amp;nbsp;mg/lt), and the maximum is presented in Mexico(0.75&amp;nbsp;mg/lt). Despite Brazil being one of the main producers of chromium, it doesn't have a maximum limit as do other countries.
